0,TheLittleSongbird,"Fun satirical chick flick, loosely based on Emma.",8,10 June 2009,"I really enjoyed Clueless... I found it fun, charming and easy to like. It is loosely based on Emma, and while some of the book's issues are put across here, like social standing, the story was updated to make it appealing for teenagers, and it ticks almost all of the right boxes. A perfectly cast Alicia Silverstone positively sparkles in the title role of Cher, and she is further advantaged by a funny well-written script, a classic heart felt story, and very good performances from her co-stars, such as Brekin Meyer and Brittany Murphy. The direction by Amy Heckerling was also spirited. The film looks lovely, with very nice costumes and locations. My only two criticisms are that the film is a little long, and once or twice only when the story almost falls into predictability. Overall, a fun, engaging and well acted film, that I would definitely watch again. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Clueless
1,Leofwine_draca,Influential,6,17 August 2021,"Nice to see Jane Austen getting reworked and revamped for the masses. CLUELESS is an important film in the history of Hollywood, the one that spawned a whole 'valley girl' style of cinema including such hits as LEGALLY BLONDE and MEAN GIRLS, but this was the first. Alicia Silverstone is decent and likeable as Cher and although the plot is pure fluff, the writer/director adds plenty of layers to it to give it a really professional and rewarding feel. Lots of good jokes and warm characters along the way add to the fun.",Clueless
2,SnoopyStyle,As If.,9,26 December 2015,"Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) is a Beverly Hills teen. Her father (Dan Hedaya) is a tough defense lawyer. Her stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) is coming to stay with them. Her best friend is Dionne (Stacey Dash) who keeps fighting with boyfriend Murray (Donald Faison). She loves to meddle. In a scheme to raise her grades, she puts two teachers together. Tai (Brittany Murphy) is a new student. Cher sees her as adorably clueless and makes her the next project. Tai likes slacker Travis (Breckin Meyer) but Cher disapproves. Cher tries to put Tai together with Elton (Jeremy Sisto).Writer/director Amy Heckerling loosely based this on Jane Austen's Emma. It's loads of fun with a charming young cast. It is a clever light satire on the modern materialistic teen world. It's full of fun catch phrases and hilarity. The future star power is brilliant. Silverstone is perfect and Murphy is a shooting star. It rises above a simple teen movie.",Clueless
3,Prismark10,A lot like Emma,6,4 July 2016,Director Amy Heckerling re-imagines Jane Austen's Emma into a satirical but glib look at Beverly Hills rich kids. Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash) named after singing legends that now do infomercials care more about being popular and being hip than getting a good education.Her dad is tough litigation lawyer (Dan Hedaya) widowed soon after Cher was born after a liposuction incident and staying with them temporarily is her sensitive stepbrother (Paul Rudd) from a brief marriage her dad had with his mother.Cher realises it is a good thing to bring people together after she connives in order to improve her grades by getting two of her high school teachers to hook up. She gets an urge to help others less fortunate like geeky new girl Tai (Brittany Murphy.)However one thing Cher lacks is the perfect boyfriend despite their being no lack of admirers.The film is set in a materialistic world of the super rich at high school that only exists in Hollywood. The one where students wear colour coordinated haute couture clothes and drive expensive cars despite not having passed their driving test.The message of doing good for those less fortunate sounds superficial. That Cher realises that her stepbrother might be the one who is her Mr Right feels a bit icky. Yet despite this the cast brings a lightness of touch and fun to the film that you cannot help liking it.,Clueless
4,classicsoncall,"""As if.""",6,17 July 2018,"As I go further back in time regarding IMDb's Top 250 lists, I find that I'm repeating myself in saying that I'm not part of the target audience for a picture like this, and that the early days of IMDb had to be heavily influenced by hordes of teenage viewers rating movies like ""Clueless"" so highly. Time has taken it's toll a bit by now, and for a pretty good reason; the movie just isn't that good, even for a teen comedy. It has it's moments of course, and Alicia Silverstone's character isn't as clueless as the title of the movie would suggest, but the picture offers a lot of fluff stringing together a variety of situations for Cher (Silverstone) and her cliquey friends. The one good takeaway is the way Cher befriended newcomer Tai (Brittany Murphy) into her circle and helped her become popular, in her own right. But throughout the cast, I couldn't come up with a single role model I'd point to as being someone I'd want a teenager of today to emulate. For what it's worth, my borrowed DVD copy offered up the 'Whatever' edition of the movie, which may or may not mean anything, as I'm not bothered enough to try and find out. Really, as if.",Clueless
5,lee_eisenberg,offers some clues about the future,8,10 November 2006,"Teen comedies are quite common, but ""Clueless"" has going for itself the fact that it transposes Jane Austen's ""Emma"" to mid-'90s Beverly Hills and plays with stereotypes there. We see how air-head Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) may not have a clue about the rest of the world, but her heart is always in the right place - maybe a little too much. And of course, who can forget how the movie introduced to national dialogue phrases like ""as if"".Overall, the movie functions as a sort of look at how the future would become. Maybe our society has gone too far in being like Cher. But anyway, it's just a great movie to watch. Also starring Dan Hedaya, Stacey Dash, and Brittany Murphy (happy birthday, Brittany!).Spa-rat-acus...I bet that culturally devoid people probably would say that.",Clueless
6,jboothmillard,Clueless,7,26 November 2007,"Apparently a remake of Jane Austen's Emma for the modern world, from writer/director Amy Heckerling (Fast Times at Ridgemont High). Basically Cher Horowitz (Batman & Robin's Alicia Silverstone) is the rich, pretty, blonde and popular girl who knows how to talk anyone into doing almost anything, and also the narrator. When Cher can't get a better grade from her teacher Mr. Wendell Hall (Toy Story's Wallace Shawn), she and her friend Dionne (Stacey Dash, who played the same character in the Clueless TV series) match him up with Miss Toby Geist (Twink Caplan) to them happier, and maybe boost their expectations. Cher is happy doing ""good deeds"", and when new girl Tai (Brittany Murphy) shows up, Cher and Dionne give her a makeover and try to get her a boyfriend. Cher realises doing this she wants a boyfriend as well, but she can't find the right guy. As she continues a spiritual makeover, she realises theirs more to life than clothes and popularity, and the guy of her dreams is the guy she has spent most time with as a friend, Josh (Paul Rudd). She should have also realised Tai was infatuated with Travis (Road Trip's Breckin Meyer), and vice versa, not the guy she expected to like her, Elton (Jeremy Sisto), and also the guy she originally wanted as a boyfriend, Christian (Justin Walker) was gay, it was obvious. Also starring Donald Faison as Murray, Elisa Donovan as Amber and Dan Hedaya as Mel Horowitz. It is in my book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I'd have to see it more to agree with that, but it is a good film. Very good!",Clueless
7,ccthemovieman-1,'Clueless' Is Correct,2,31 August 2007,"This was ""cute"" for a while and then became too teener-bopper oriented for me. I guess if you are a 13-16-year-old female, you'd relate and like this film.Sad to say, it's another film which gives poor messages to teens. Hey, kids....want to have casual sex? No problem....go for it! Nice. Leave it the ultra--Liberal and moral bankrupt world of film making. Clueless is a good title for people who make films like this, not just the lead character in the movie.According to Hollywood, being a teen - as shown in this movie -- revolves only around your social life, plastic surgery, cellphones, drugs and sex. It's all made nice and surgery by having the pretty and sweet-looking Alice Silverstone in the lead. She plays the not-so-- sweet ""Cher,"" an apt name for materialistic, spoiled brat. When the messages are, for example, virginity is bad, but drugs are okay, even fun to experiment.This tale of teen matchmaking and other topics that will make an adult want to puke, does have a decent cast with always-interesting guys like Dan Hedeya and Wallace Shawn and another young ""hottie"" in Brittany Murphy. However, you wouldn't want your kids to watch this garbage, believe me.Overall, the title says is all.",Clueless
8,Tweekums,Fun nineties teen comedy,8,6 October 2012,"Cher Horowitz, the protagonist and narrator, is a sixteen year old girl living in affluent Beverley Hills; her life appears to revolve around shopping, fashion and acting as matchmaker for those she thinks need her help. Early on she and her friend Dionne engineer a romance between two of their teachers; partially because she figures they are more likely to give good grades if they are happy and partially because 'Old people can be so sweet'. When new kid Tai Fraiser joins her class Cher has a new project; she must make the new girl fashionable and hook her up with one of the schools more eligible boys while steering her away from the wrong sort. Along the way she thinks she has found love too but she isn't quite what he is looking for in a relationship... mostly because she is a she! While all this is going on with her school friends her older step-brother is visiting and he clearly thinks she is rather shallow but as they get to know each other they inevitably get closer.A plot synopsis makes this sound like a cheesy rom-com but there is more com than rom and the comedy is genuinely funny. The 'valley speak' doesn't quite descend into parody so you believe the characters might actually talk like that. The situations provide lots of laughs and the film is packed with snappy, eminently quotable dialogue. The cast put is solid performances, especially Alicia Silverstone and Brittany Murphy who play Cher and Tai respectively; Dan Hedaya was also great as her father, I loved how he delivered the line' Anything happens to my daughter, I got a .45 and a shovel, I doubt anybody would miss you.' to a potential suitor! I'm no where near the target demographic but really enjoyed this film; I suspect most people it is actually aimed at will love it.",Clueless
9,moonspinner55,"A refreshing change from the John Hughes/""Breakfast Club"" generation",6,23 December 2001,"Silky-smooth, vanilla-coated pleasure about matchmaking in modern-day high school. Far from the insufferable smugness of all those '80s teen-flicks, ""Clueless"" is bright--in both senses of the word--clever, funny, fanciful and yet grounded in reality (a rich one). Alicia Silverstone is adorable, but the supporting cast is affable and seemingly carefully-picked (they all get their share of funny lines, particularly Dan Hedaya superb as Silverstone's father). Seems more inspired by Jane Austen's ""Emma"" than based upon it, with a few mean-spirited lines but plenty of lightly innocent laugh-getters. **1/2 from ****",Clueless
10,Quinoa1984,Somewhat interesting,8,24 September 2000,"I find that this movie is like an experience I like to call going to the mall.  It is quite interesting to view these people in action and observation and you almost feel as if you want to be them.  That is, until you see the ridiculous amounts of clothes they own and bimbo minded intelects they have.  SO, in respects, I found this movie funny, in parts (and as a satire), but it is nothing new.  The plot (inspired in part by Jane Austen's Emma) involves a very upper-middle class girl named Cher Horowitz played by Alicia Silverstone in her breakthrough (Jewish with a touch of Cher nameness) who wants to find the right kind of man, but is left with a bunch of slobs (duh), wants to do anything she can to get good grades, and try to keep an empty head while trying to drive.  Sometimes hilarious, sometimes annoying, overall, it's good, just as long as you don't take it too seriously.  My favorite character is played by Breckin Meyer who has 37 tardies (right on, like whatever).  B+",Clueless
11,tavm,"Having finally watched the entirety of Clueless just now, I found it quite charming despite the now-dated references",9,13 June 2013,"Well, after nearly 20 years of only seeing certain scenes in this movie (I was working as an usher when this came out and snuck in some movie-watching time in between shows), I finally watched the whole thing with my mom just now on Netflix disc. In short, this was quite a funny movie about teens in the '90s with many of the now-dated references and cultural fashions not too much of a deterrent of a still-enjoyable story inspired by Jane Austen's novel Emma (though I can't believe those below-the-butt styles of today was actually quite the style then as well). Alicia Silverstone is both at her prettiest and charming in the lead role of Cher, the shallow teen thinking she's all that but also good at heart. Brittany Murphy is also great as Tai, the new girl who blossoms under Cher. Too bad her life was cut short a few years ago. And director Amy Heckerling, already an expert on depicting high school situations having previously helmed another classic called Fast Times at Ridgemont High, outdoes herself here as a writer as well with the material the cast is given. So on that note, Clueless comes highly recommended.",Clueless
12,sunwarrior13,Social Insight On Teen-agers,8,12 July 2015,"Alicia Silverstone stars in a comedic film that becomes a satire on the ultra-rich High School students that is based on Jane Austen's 1816 novel ""Emma"".Cher and Dionne are upper-class students at a Beverly Hills High School who cares more about wearing the right clothes and popularity rather than getting good grades.But Cher found herself wanting to more in life as she wants to help the less fortunate as well.She later takes action by bringing two of her two introverted teachers who wants to do the same and tries to convince them to give her higher grades as well.She meets a new friend Tai,who starts out as a geek but later becomes her prodigy.Unexpectedly,she meets the perfect boyfriend at the least expected moment.This becomes a fresh and original film about teen-agers that its intended audience will probably still enjoy today despite being released in the 1990's.The screenplay did very well in dealing with the shallowness that female rich teen-agers that viewers are accustomed with.Miss Silverstone also provided a good performance especially with the way she dealt with Cher's character transformation in the road to maturity.This will always remain a compelling move about teens up to the present moment especially with the way it provides a social insight on teen-agers.",Clueless
13,hitchcockthelegend,Suddenly a dark cloud settled over first period... I got a C in debate?,7,24 August 2009,"Jane Austen's Emma gets a Bronson Alcott High School makeover......Much like Mean Girls that would follow nine years later, Clueless has a lot more beneath its pastel coloured surface than merely High School coming of age froth. Firmly cloaked in satirical winks, Amy Heckerling's {Look Who's Talking} film is a sharp parody of the wealthy whilst cunningly observing the life essentials such as friends, family and the four letter word that is love. Told from the perspective of Cher {a delightful, pretty and breezy Alicia Silverstone}, Clueless follows the Austen formula of a young girl who means to do well for others without realising she is sacrificing her own destiny. Cher is a wonderful jumble of contradictions, but in a good way. She's brainy but stupid, sophisticated but totally ignorant. She is a character that in the wrong hands could really have sank the movie's motives. So it's with great credit that Silverstone, guided by Heckerling's writing and direction, makes Cher utterly adorable in spite of her deficiencies. In fact it gives the film its strength. The ending for sure is never in doubt, but with the sharpness of tongue {the sassy teen dialect is a metaphoric joy} blending in with the air of sweetness throughout, Heckerling has crafted an alternative, modern day classic of her own.Backing up the fine work from Silverstone is the equally pretty Stacey Dash as best pal Dionne {a 30 year old playing a 15 year old!}, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Dan Hedaya {joyous as Cher's father}, Donald Faison and Breckin Meyer. A rocking sound track helps the movie flow, and Bill Pope's photography of the California locations looks pristine in High Definition. It's a warm and intelligent picture is Clueless, far from perfect, but in itself most definitely not clueless. 7.5/10",Clueless
14,utgard14,"""We might get Marky Mark to plant a celebrity tree.""",7,16 August 2014,"A fun teen comedy from Amy Heckerling, the director of the woefully overrated Fast Times at Ridgemont High and the first two Look Who's Talking movies. Clueless is the best thing she's ever done, in my opinion. It put Alicia Silverstone on the map. Well, that and Aerosmith videos. Silverstone is pitch-perfect as Cher, the role of her career. It's impossible not to like her in this movie. It's also pretty much the best thing Stacey Dash and Breckin Meyer ever did. Not to mention the first big role for Paul Rudd. As most everyone knows, it's based on Jane Austen's ""Emma."" For a teen comedy, it's refreshingly smart. The story may not be all that but there's lots of good dialogue rather than a string of F-bombs or Stifler-like characters. One of the few memorable '90s comedies.",Clueless
15,Boba_Fett1138,Original enough within its sort to consider this a good movie.,7,4 June 2012,"With so many other high school comedies out there, this one definitely feels like a breath of fresh air, since it's taking a bit of a different approach, that works out as well.High school comedies are either extremely goofy, or when they aren't, they are being complete annoying ones to watch, with its clichéd characters and standard story lines. This movie however feels like a different type of comedy. It still has all of the clichés in it and the movie has some silly comedy as well but it all is much more clever about with it. It actually has some good writing to it, even though the movie in essence is still being a formulaic one.The story is all about the stuff that only was important at high school; being popular, having the right friends, dress properly, getting with the right boy/girl, struggling with grades and everything else in between of that. Normally stuff like his only annoys me in movies but in this movie it's all good and fun to watch. It's also because all of the characters are likable ones, so it's not punishment to follow them around in the story.It besides has a good and pleasant pace to it, that keeps things going at all times. There is plenty of variety in the story as well and the movie doesn't just dwells on one or two story lines or characters. Looking back at it, it's quite amazing the amount of stuff they managed to get into this movie, also since it's only an about 90 minutes short movie.This however also has as a result that some of the story lines are skipped over too quickly and end abruptly, while they potentially were some good and interesting story lines, with some likable characters involved. Also in essence, it really doesn't have a story that is going anywhere with anything. I can see how some people would call this an irrelevant and pointless movie to watch, though fact for me simply remains that this movie is a good watch and therefore alone is worth checking out already.It's also being somewhat a social commentary to the '90's. Even though the movie itself got made in the mid-'90's, it still has the capability to look at it from a distance and even make fun of some of its odd stereotypes, such as its clothing.It also is a movie with some good acting in it, which normally isn't really something that film-makers consider to be all that important for these type of movies. It's about looks only, for most of them but in this movie they managed to get together a bunch of solid actors as well. Alicia Silverstone is a great leading lady and it also was fun to see some now big name actors appear in this movie, in some of their earliest roles. I'm talking about actors such as Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Breckin Meyer and Jeremy Sisto. Quite an amazing cast list for an high school movie, in today's perspective.An original and enjoyable enough movie within its genre!7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Clueless

17,evanston_dad,A Wonderfully Clueless Emma,9,5 June 2006,"Who would have thought that the best screen adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Emma"" would emerge from an updated parody set in a Beverly Hills high school and directed by Amy Heckerling? But that's exactly what has happened with this film.Heckerling obviously gets that Austen's continuous appeal lies in the fact that her stories remain relevant and timely---so why not update it, make the character of Emma (Cher here, played by the adorable Alicia Silverstone) a daffy valley girl, and fill the movie to the brim with pop-culture references and one very funny vignette after another? After all, the spirit and tone of ""Emma"" emerges unscathed.Comedic performances are always underrated, maybe because they look so easy, but Silverstone really deserves a lot of praise for this movie.

18,Wuchakk,"In the same league as ""Fast Times""",9,26 January 2015,"Released in 1995, ""Clueless"" is a teen dramedy about, Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a rich Beverly Hills high school student who experiences the ups and downs of teen life in Southern California. Cher hangs with her best friend, Dionne (Stacey Dash), and they befriend a new girl who seems to need their help, Ty (Brittany Murphy). Beyond this, Cher looks for romance and finds it in an unexpected person. Justin Walker is on hand as Cher's potential beau, Christian, as is Jeremy Sisto; and Paul Rudd as her sometimes annoying, but always reliable ex-stepbrother, Josh.Like 1982's ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""Clueless"" transcends the mediocrity and pitfalls of most teen dramedies and breaks the threshold of greatness. While it's honest about things like dating, sex and cussing, it refuses to overdo any of them and, instead, focuses on the real-life joys, low points and everything in between of a beautiful and goodhearted well-to-do Southern California girl.The film was a modest hit at the box office and justifiably so. It's hip, smart, honest and heartwarming. Silverstone is precious and lovable in the title role and easily carries the film. Rudd is equally effective as the ex-stepbrother. Dash is utterly stunning and both Walker and Murphy are competent. The film leaves you with a good feeling.The movie runs 97 minutes and was shot in the Beverly Hills and the Los Angeles area.GRADE: A",Clueless
19,JamesHitchcock,Unbecoming Jane,6,9 February 2018,"Jane Austen, along with E M Forster, was one of the entertainment industry's favourite authors during the nineties, when several adaptations of her novels were made, both for the cinema and for television. During the middle part of the decade there were no fewer than three adaptations of her ""Emma"", including the feature film with Gwyneth Paltrow and the TV movie with Kate Beckinsale, both from 1996. The third was ""Clueless"" from the previous year. At first sight, ""Clueless"" would not appear to have anything to do with Austen at all. It is set not in Regency England but in a contemporary Beverly Hills high school. The characters and incidents, however, closely parallel those in the original novel. In British usage the word ""clueless"" is normally a synonym for ""stupid"". (It is often used in Northern England as an alternative to ""gormless""). It would appear, however, that in American usage its meaning can be closer to ""awkward"", ""gauche"" or ""socially inept""; when characters in the film are described as ""clueless"" it implies ignorance of the social conventions which prevail in the school. The Emma Woodhouse of the school is Cher Horowitz, the fifteen-year-old daughter of a successful lawyer. Because Cher is attractive, from a wealthy family and looks good in a mini-skirt, she is the ""most popular girl in the school"". Unlike most girls who are referred to in this way in high school comedies, however, Cher is not snobbish or bitchy. In fact, she is rather kind-hearted and well-intentioned, if at times thoughtless and superficial. She likes to do what she sees as ""good deeds"", which generally means playing matchmaker for her friends, and even two of her teachers. The film's title refers to Cher's efforts to educate a ""clueless"" newcomer, Tai, in the ways of the school and to find a boyfriend for her. (Tai is the equivalent of Austen's character Harriet Smith). Alicia Silverstone was one of a number of beautiful young actresses in the nineties who seemed set for Hollywood stardom but who never quite made it, or at least only achieved it temporarily before retiring or slipping back into the B-list; others included Julia Ormonde, Bridget Fonda, Phoebe Cates and Silverstone's co-star here, Stacey Dash. The third female lead here, Brittany Murphy, cast against type as the rather dowdy Tai, did become a major star, but her career was cut short by her tragically early death. Yet Silverstone's performance here shows just why she was tipped for stardom. She makes Cher not just attractive but also smart, funny and appealing, the sort of teenage girl who, for all her flaws, would have every teenage boy mad for her. The one thing Silverstone never quite manages is to persuade us that Cher is only fifteen, even though at nineteen she was younger than a lot of actresses called upon to play high school girls. (Dash, who plays Cher's best friend Dionne, was 28). Cher comes across as being just too adult, too knowing and too sexual for her supposed age. Cher's fretting about the fact that she has yet to lose her virginity struck me as a bit inappropriate for a fifteen-year-old. I wondered, in fact, if the film might have been better if writer/director Amy Heckerling had set her story in a college rather than in a high school, that is to say among young people closer in age to Austen's characters. Doubtless, however, the studio wanted to keep the teenage market. Another thing that struck me as odd is that the George Knightley figure is Cher's ex-stepbrother Josh- their parents are divorced- which means that two people brought up together as brother and sister, even if they are not biologically related, end up as boyfriend and girlfriend. I know that ""Cruel Intentions"", another teenage comedy from the nineties, also dealt with step-siblings who were impliedly sexually attracted to one another, but then in that film Kathryn and Sebastian were supposed to be a bit weird and creepy; Cher and Josh are supposed to be much more normal. In Austen's novel George is the brother-in-law of Emma's best friend Isabella, but the film-makers departed from the text, probably because Dionne is black and following Austen too closely in this respect would have meant either giving Dionne a white boyfriend or Cher a black one. Hollywood's traditional uneasiness about interracial romance was stronger in the nineties than it is today. 
 
""Clueless"" (like the ""Bill and Ted"" adventures) is firmly rooted in nineties youth culture, especially the fashions and American teenage slang of the period. We learn that an ugly man is a ""barney"" (as in the purple dinosaur) and a handsome one a ""Baldwin"" (as in Alec, William and Stephen). A pretty woman is a ""Betty"", the etymology of which seems more obscure. (One explanation I have heard is that ""Betty"" was Lauren Bacall's real name, but I doubt if Cher and her crowd would have heard of Bacall, let alone cared what her real name was). Even in 1995 British audiences would have needed subtitles to understand all the dialogue, and today, more than 20 years on, I suspect that some American ones would as well. Like its heroine, ""Clueless"" can sometimes seem a bit superficial, despite its august literary antecedents, but on the whole it is all good fun. Even though its original teenage audience will now have children- in some cases teenage children- of their own, it holds up surprisingly well (apart from its dated slang) in the twenty-first century and is starting to acquire a cult appeal as a sort of nostalgic relic. 6/10",Clueless
20,StevePulaski,"Moves, behaves, and mesmerizes like a high school girl",9,7 October 2015,"Amy Heckerling's Clueless does two things I never thought I'd see a teen movie do and that's, for one, humanize a group of commonly stereotyped, mostly materialistic brats to the point where someone can actually find them not only amusing but sympathetic characters, and two, bring out the main ideas of a beloved piece of classic literature through a smooth, respectful modernization. In case you haven't noticed, the film is loosely based off of Jane Austen's 1815 Emma, a bourgeois look at marriage and fidelity, and Heckerling does a nice job of minimizing that fact just enough to where the film's target audience doesn't feel like the lights are off and they are struggling to stay awake during movie-time in their literature class.Moreover, Clueless is a film that's so easy to love but so hard to adequately describe why. It concerns a young, high school girl named Cher (Alicia Silverstone), your average Beverly Hills girl who speaks and acts just like you'd presume a spoiled mansion girl would. Her widowed father Mel (Dan Hedaya) is a litigator, basically meaning he ""gets paid to argue,"" so she claims, and her best friend is Dionne (Stacey Dash), who sticks by her side through all her dramatic moments and daily quibbles. One of Cher's most recent dramatic moments of crisis is when her ex-stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) comes to live with her and her father temporarily during the same time a new girl by the name of Tai (Brittany Murphy) enrolls in Cher's high school. After playing matchmaker for two nerdy teachers, Mr. Hall and Miss Geist (Wallace Shawn and Twink Caplan, who are based off of Mr. Weston and Miss Taylor in Emma) in efforts to improve her lackluster grades, Cher is convinced that she can turn Tai's rather average personality and beauty into knockout-level by fixing her wardrobe and mannerisms and setting her up with Elton (Jeremy Sisto), a wealthy jock, despite her fondness for Travis (Breckin Meyer), the troublemaking slacker.Heckerling, who takes over the screen writing job as well, really works not only to keep Clueless moving at a pace that consistently keeps the audience interested, but to humanize these often dehumanized, and admittedly unlikable, characters. Thinking back to our own experiences in high school, I'm sure we could put other names to every character I just listed and Heckerling does that in order to form that kind of connection. Most teen films have that kind of familiarity with their story. However, instead of stopping there, she works to illicit a kind of humanization that makes you sympathetic to these characters. By the end of the film, or even midway through, Cher doesn't seem like such brash diva with a credit card, but a strangely harmless figure wrapped up in herself to a fault.Cher may be a bit intoxicating and cocky, but one thing she isn't is harmful or a bully to those not ""in her league."" Even her efforts to set Tai up with Elton instead of Travis, while a hasty and somewhat cold to her friend's personal feelings, isn't meant to be a ploy nor an attempt to oppress her character whilst holding on to her popularity. She's a more complex figure than one initially assumes because her efforts are just misguided and her attitude is more conceited than open; she's not a particularly bad person or the ""queen bitch"" of her high school.Heckerling's dialog in the film is sharp and biting, as if every character on-screen unabashedly says what's on his or her mind rather than locking down their feelings for a more socially acceptable comment. Consider Josh's response to Cher she asks him if there's anything she could selflessly do that would benefit humanity. Josh opens the refrigerator door before turning around and replying with, ""sterilization."" This kind of dialog carries throughout the film and no character here feels out of Heckerling's beautifully satirical, revealing little universe; nobody feels like they're not in on the joke nor lost in their own role.Clueless, I feel, speaks to the millennial generation and those born in the early 2000's better than anybody, though nobody would be removed from enjoying this; the familiarity of Austen's novel on older viewers and the casual depiction of the teen scene on the younger viewers is one makes this film have almost universal appeal. However, the way Clueless moves with a certain stride in its hips, like a teenage girl with a new outfit, the way it talks, with a Californian accent that has every syllable hitting your ears in a unique manner, and the way the music, the dialog, and the mannerisms of the characters resonate so fiercely, is what ultimately makes it a winning combination of an ordinary chick flick and a biting teen film.Starring: Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Stacey Dash, Breckin Meyer, Jeremy Sisto, Wallace Shawn, Twink Caplan, Donald Faison, and Dan Hedaya.

21,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Alicia, you rock!",8,23 November 2003,"A lot of people ask why ""Clueless"" was so popular or how people could enjoy this, for me I think because you can tell that the cast had so much fun doing this film! They made such a memorable team and a must see movie from the 90's. This movie could have everything you could possibly want: shopping, clothes, catchy lines, sex, and teens! OK, I'm kidding, but ""Clueless"" is such a fun film.Alicia Silverstone in her best movie role as Cher Horweitz. A rich and extremely popular teenage girl who has it all. She has friends, money, a car, a line of admirers, setting two teachers up to fall madly in love with each other, good grades, an awesome best friend(D), and a crazy but loving father who would do anything for her. She has the world at her fingertips, but when her college step brother tells her that she should do something more in her life and calls her selfish, she finds a very young Britney Murphy or her role as Tai Frasier and wants to make her into her own clan of clueless friends. But when Tai gets out of hand and becomes the most popular girl in school, Cher starts to loose it and discovers herself that she is clueless. The reason why Cher is so lovable though is because she wasn't your typical stereo type of a teen, she had friends of a different race, background, click, and homosexuals. She's just so cute and lovable as a person, how could you not love her? This movie has every memorable quote you could imagine from ""As If!"" to ""Whatever!"", yes, this is Valley. But it's just a lot of fun movie that everyone would love and enjoy. This is a must see movie if you want the best flicks from the 90's! 8/10",Clueless
22,MovieAddict2016,Clever spin on Austen's story with good satire and performances,7,31 August 2005,"Cher (Alicia Silverstone) is a popular ditz at her local high school in Beverly Hills. She's a spoiled, pampered little princess with all the right social connections and endless wealth. However she has yet to find a man in her life - all the Baldwins (as she and her clique of friends call guys they like) have been taken.When Cher receives a foreign exchange student, she takes her under her wing and decides to try and find her a boyfriend - ironically without having her own yet. Predictability ensues.I read ""Emma"" in early high school as I'm sure most kids did, and the movie puts a clever spin on the tale. Alicia Silverstone is surprisingly good in her role, perfectly playing a blond bombshell without a brain but a good heart - only Reese Witherspoon has done such a good job recently at portraying the west coast bimbos. (No offense to the west coast bimbos out there.) The movie's director, Amy Heckerling, has always been rather reliable on the whole and her direction is solid here - she could have turned ""Clueless"" into a crude, unfunny sex comedy with little wit or brains, but instead she takes a rather dubious idea for a film and transforms it into a well-made, well-acted, funny, inspired, lively, witty satire.Much better than expected.",Clueless
23,lasttimeisaw,high on wishful romanticism and low in adolescent toxin,7,19 April 2017,"Transposing Jane Austen's EMMA to Beverly Hills, Amy Heckerling's 90s chick flick CLUELESS was a sleeper hit upon its release, spawned one less toothsome TV series, and has charmed its way with a cult following ever since. What quintessentially demarcates this one from the derogative genre's other huge supply of glops? It must be its attitude, which is devoid of self-importance in spite of that the whole picture is built upon a milieu predominantly reeks of snobbery and superficiality, ornamented by a pleasurable dosage of self-mockery. Our heroine is Cher (Silverstone), a 16-year-old high school girl seems to be privileged of everything (beauty, youth, wealth and sagacity: knows how to give a wide berth to her inane male peers and more than willing to save her virginity for the one she will fall in love with), who has an unusual down-to-earth streak and all she wants is to be a Good Samaritan, plays match-maker to her two teachers, and determines to help an awkward blow-in Tai (Murphy) to gain popularity, and her BFF Dionne (Dash) is also on board. An unmistakable girl-power through-line sails alongside the film's polymorphic themes, ranging from adolescent crush (on a friend of Dorothy, a very spunky move to inject a positive vibe to the often sidelined minority), ""he is not that into you"" misunderstanding, chirpy school rivalry (a wonder at then where bullies are excluded within the context), to realize what/who a girl really wants (a corny epiphany under the fountain sending a homage to GIGI, 1958). A hiccup will duly arise, girls will squabble, but at the end of the day, for Cher, friendship is the real deal, in company with finding her Mr. Right (of course, no high-schoolers). The recurring gag of ""as if"" might now sounds like a flea in the ear for all its affectation, but understandably, that also underlies its appeal, a spoiled blondie's unashamed mannerism nonetheless, the whole scenario is lubricated by a good-natured cause and propelled by a crescendo of emotional honesty, you have the irony, humor and eye-candies in one combo! Two decades on, it is somewhat bemusing that Alicia Silverstone hasn't catapulted into the A-list à la Emma Stone (nor is she led up the garden path à la Lindsay Logan either), her career would stick in a limbo ever since that ill-fated BatGirl offer. She has that ""it"" girl look and sweetness, and plies her shallow character with unstinting ammo of assurance and cutesy allure. The late Brittany Murphy, in her second film credit, also carries off an effervescent mien as the ugly duckling, a tad barmy, but not a shrinking violet steeped in lament. Definitely capturing the teen spirit of 90s in America's posh sphere, and thanks to a cunning maneuver of its time-honored source story, CLUELESS is high on wishful romanticism and low in adolescent toxin, harmless refreshment to a weary soul.",Clueless
24,OllieSuave-007,Not a bad teenage flick overall.,7,17 August 2017,"Alicia Silverstone plays a high school student named Cher, who uses her wit, charm and wealth to mold her friends and teachers into finding happiness. Her demeanor seemed superficial and typical, but we later find out that her views on self-dignity and her relationships with family and friends add to a healthy adolescent social life people could relate to.There are some funny moments here, from Cher's valley girl talk and teenage characteristics to her friend Dionne's chaotic car ride on the freeway. Cher displays clueless moments indeed, but are delivered with innocent fun and humor. The plot can be slow at times and some scenes are not suitable for children, but it's really not a bad teenage flick overall.Grade B-",Clueless
25,thesar-2,This Friend of Dorothy Loves Cher and Cher,8,13 April 2013,"As ifyou haven't seen this 1990s classic, you should now.Back in the mid to upper 1990s, I first saw Clueless and as much as I laughed hard and thoroughly enjoyed it, I knew right then, as fresh as it was, it was going to be a dated movie. Fast forward 18 years, and it's – totally! – still enjoyable, but I agree with my original thought.So, I can see someone saying that it's dated nowadays, especially kids, or anyone that missed it back then. Luckily, I caught it new and still love it just as much.Normally, I hate to be around or watch either bimbos or mimbos, but I had a feeling this movie wasn't glorifying them; instead, they were severely mocking them. But, when the very talented (at least for this role) Alicia Silverstone can play someone with less than half a brain and selfish and yet, contains a full heart, I admire the movie – and her performance – even more.Totally Valley Cher (Silverstone) and her pal, Dionne, spend their time: using up their rich family's money by incessantly shopping, grouping fellow high school kids into segregations and occasionally caring about ""the lesser and unfortunate"" people, which, in real life, have more going for them than 3 of both Cher and Dionne combined. But, this is a slapstick kind of comedy, so let's try not to get too deep.The first half of the movie is just one example after the next of perky Cher and her high zest in life and an actual ""second movie"" appears when the ultrathin plot is revealed: Cher's outward appearance doesn't match her insides. She wants companionship and the movie tries to convey that with little success, but enough to give the movie a slight spark of a conflict. It's the second half where the film, unfortunately, loses a little steam and overstays its welcome a bit.All of that doesn't matter; Clueless is not really just that. In a lot of ways, it's brilliant, absolutely hilarious, contains fantastic secondary characters and has both some enormously quotable lines and very funny scenes. Not to mention, the incredible soundtrack that I recall buying immediately following my first viewing. While I like practically every song on the album, Kids in America, the opening title song to the motion picture, is one of my all time movie favorite songs.Since I was part of the pack that saw this before it became passé, I believe it still holds up today and it was great to revisit a lot of the scenes, lines and songs I grew up loving. See it, gurl!Side Note: Oh, and Paul (Rudd): I had a huge crush on you back then, and still today. You look so young here, at 26, even though you haven't seemed like you've aged much since. Many people credit this as your first movie, but I knew better – I first noticed, and fell head over heels for you, in the atrocious Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers. Waitoh, that's why you want people to believe this is your first role. Good call.Side Note II: As many lines in this I still quote today, this was my first introduction to the phrase ""A Friend of Dorothy,"" which means, um, ""Not a Fan of Hustler."" I died laughing hearing that for the first time, even though it was obvious to whom they were referring to as such in the movie. Maybe, Cher was, in fact, Clueless. Um. Maybe?",Clueless
26,paul2001sw-1,Charmless,5,27 November 2007,"The American high-school movie is a well-defined genre, typically featuring lashings of money, beauty, bitchiness and hedonism. Such excess could be defended as satire, but so cleanly do so many films fit the pattern, and so remote from ""real life"" does it seem to be, that it is probably fairer to consider these movies a celebration of the worlds they depict; and there's always a stench of hypocrisy emanating from the stuck-on conservative endings (always urging the happy mean) that form the invariable conclusion (you know what I mean here: the plain girl will always get a makeover, the pretty one will always develop some depth, everyone lives happily ever after). 'Clueless' is perfectly attuned to the template: indeed, it may even have helped define it, with certain elements of the story familiar to me from many later movies; and the style of the film also fits the mould, with its incessant use of random pop music, and a narrative voice as well, just in case you can't follow exactly where the story is going.

I never saw any of them when I was a teen! That being said, this movie was perfectly serviceable to me. I've just seen so many awful comedies, there's no comparison on what's better. I thought this had something to do with the game ""Clue"".Apparently, that's another movie. I heard the title being dropped around 22 minutes, when the new girl came in. I thought that she was going to be the focus of the movie. I am glad they looked at so many different aspects of the life of a teenage girl. Yeah, being a boy, I couldn't associate with it that much.

Poor, because she is having trouble with a certain high school teacher (Wallace Shawn) and is also plagued by a nagging stepbrother (Paul Rudd). Yet, whenever this gal has heartache, she heads to the galleria with her best buds and gleefully uses her plastic money. Convinced that she may improve her grades if she can get her single teachers ""matched"", Cher hatches some strategies. Delighted with her subsequent success, this high school gal decides to befriend a newly-transferred student, Tai (Brittany Murphy) and get her matched up with a popular guy, Elton (Jeremy Sisto). But, Elton may have his eye on someone else. Now, into the secondary school comes an absolute dreamboat, Christian. Cher, who has always looked upon her fellow male students as immature brats, now wants to ""hook up"" with Christian in the worst way. Yet, all of her overtures to the young man seem to fail. Why doesn't he look her way? Could it be that he has his gaze on someone else, too? This is a classic, is Clueless, in films about high school. It is extremely funny, intelligent, and hip. The cast is great, with Silverstone giving a definitive turn as Cher. Rudd, Murphy, Breckin Meyer, Stacey Dash, Sisto, and all of the others are great, too. As for the costumes, they are supremely wonderful and the sunny California setting is lovely, too.

32,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,8,8 August 2012,"Clueless The worst part of being a teenager in the 1990s was that absentee parenting was 15 years away.Fortunately, the spoilt socialite in this comedy is on good terms with her single-father.When a severely un-hip chick, Tai (Brittany Murphy), transfers to their high school, Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash) attempt to turn the kindhearted new girl into a shallow shopaholic like them.On the home front, Cher's father (Dan Hedaya) has taken her ex-stepbrother (Paul Rudd) in, leading to constant bickering between the two.However, her home life doesn't stop Cher from using her matchmaking skills to pair Tai with Elton (Jeremy Sisto), who, unfortunately, has a big time crush on Cher.The quintessential deconstruction of affluent teenagers, this Jane Austin's Emma inspired coming-of-age tale is a witty and relevant representation of a naive generation.Incidentally, thanks to Wikipedia, at least today's young people can feign intelligence.

Cher (Alicia Silverstone)---and her coterie of friends---have the nicest cars and clothes. And they unabashedly accept their economic advantages, making them instruments for lampooning the Beverly Hills way of life.But Cher is also caring, introspective, and loyal. Like Elle in ""Legally Blonde"", she has a lifestyle that sports the trappings usually associated with a shallow character (plus she verbalizes in Valspeak), but she is a good person. And like a female version of Ferris Bueller, she has a superhero vibe, because she always seems to rise above the above the fray and to emerge unscathed from circumstances that would entangle others.Cher is a creation of director Amy Heckerling, and her supercool persona drives the film. As a result, ""Clueless"" is, at times, funny, joyous, romantic, and clever. It is also aided by a strong cast, featuring Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Dan Hedaya, and my favorite character actor, Wallace Shawn. It also features a great soundtrack.This is one of the best teen movies of all time. I will continue to rewatch this film even if I have to spend major ducats.",Clueless
34,The-Sarkologist,A light hearted comedy based on Jane Austin's Emma,9,18 November 2011,"When I first heard of this movie way back in the mists of time (okay only four years ago) I wasn't particularly interested, but then I decided that I would pop along to a screening that the Film Society at Adelaide University was showing it and I decided to go along and was pleasantly surprised. The critics loved this movie and I also think it was pretty good as well, good enough to hire it to see if it was worth purchasing. My conclusion: I won't purchase it but I wouldn't stop anybody else from doing so. The reason I wouldn't buy it is because it comes out with relationships coming together and working out and it is a really happy ending type movie. This is not bad but it is not something that raises the emotions too much.Clueless is a movies of lines, and Ebert has fun quoting them. My two favourite are ""my dad's a litigator, that's the scariest type of lawyer, even our maid fears her,"" and ""is that Josh, isn't it amazing that when he comes to a party he finds the only Adult. It is as if he is trying to be boring."" Clueless is a movie of smart lines with ironic twists and has a pretty good mix of satire, though it not scathing and there is no attack at the American society.When creating this movie, Amy Heckerling actually went into a Beverly Hills' high school to do some research of the language used and in general the way of life of the students. It is as if she is doing a remake of Fast Times at Ridgemont High, though this movie has very little similarities. She seems to have something against sex because her two main characters, Dionne and Cher, are only interested in sleeping with one person only, and that is the person that they plan to spend the rest of their lives with. In a way this movie is idealistic because in the end we are led to believe that the people whom the characters have joined up with will last forever.Like Fast Times, Heckerling focuses on the females. This is a movie through the eyes of a female and is about females. Not only to we follow her around, but we delve into her mind knowing everything that she is thinking. The voice over representing her thoughts is used very frequently in this movie and thus we know everything that Cher is thinking. We know what she thinks of other people, and what her plans are. We even follow her thoughts to the realisation of who she really loves.Ebert seems more interested in the realism and uniqueness of the characters. I agree with him that Cher's father is a well built character that loves his daughter and knows what is going on. They have a good relationship, yet he doesn't let her get away with everything, including driving the car without a license. Tai, the looser that comes to the school and is remade by Cher and Dionne, changes from being a dag who hangs around with druggies, to a high society girl that picks and chooses her friends. Josh (Paul Rudd) is also a very well made character who is intelligent and caring. Cher is simply superb for we know her thoughts and we see how she comes to understanding of things.This movie isn't a sex-romp comedy, it is simply a comedy and the comedy is very good. It contains some of the most wittiest dialogue I have ever heard (bar Clerks which is in a league of its own) though it is not the style of movie that I would delve into. I prefer dark movies and political criticism and satire (though my satire is far from being funny).Something that I did not know when I originally wrote this piece was that this movie is based upon the Jane Austin novel Emma. I have not read the novel (ergo I did not see the connection until after). Amy Heckerling is said to have replied, when asked to write a movie for teenagers, that she would write one based on Emma as that was a book she read as a teenager. Granted, I am not a big fan of Jane Austin, but that does not mean that she is not a good write. In fact, she did very well for the time in which she was writing (despite not being recognised until at least 150 years after her death). Based on the outline of Emma that I have read, this movie is actually quite faithful to the original, though my understanding is that Emma gets herself into a lot of trouble with her meddling in other people's affairs, whereas Cher does not seem to get into anywhere near as much trouble in this film. Further, one starts off finding Cher very annoying, but as we get to understand her more through the film (and her reasons for rejecting Elton) we actually begin to develop a soft spot for her character. As such, this does make for quite a good movie.",Clueless

I'm not sure what happened to Silverstone's career, I know ""Batman & Robin"" didn't help matters, but she was a likable leading lady who looked good (check out her bum in the scene when she is in her grey workout costume) and she could certainly act, so why she disappeared is a bit of a mystery.

Before Silverstone was a retired-actress-turned-naturist; before Dash was just another Fox News pundit; and when Rudd was young, funny and good-looking...as opposed to now, when he's middle-aged, funny and good-looking. They were part of a cultural phenom that was so thoroughly 90s we wondered if its greatness could hold over time. Well, either my nostalgia is strengthening, or the film is actually getting better with age. Clueless is as funny as ever, lovingly laughing at its characters with a timeless sense of teenage naivete. 
The story of posh high-schooler Cher (a never-better Silverstone) and her gang of hilariously un-self-aware cohorts is a segmented film. Befriending and making-over a lower-class classmate. Falling for the James-Dean-esque new kid. Playing matchmaker to some lonely teachers. Learning how to drive. Dealing with your mopey, know-it-all college stepbrother. It's a collage of teenage moments; nonetheless, there's a beautiful cohesion throughout. The colorful dialogue of obnoxious colloquialisms and the beyond-perfect casting ground the film at every boa'd, saggy pants'd turn. 
Sure, Clueless is a ""chick flick"", but to write it off because of that would be to ignore how smart and subtly subversive the movie is. Based on the Jane Austen book Emma, the story parallels are not only fun and unexpectedly exact, they give the plight of these decidedly unsympathetic characters a rare gravitas. Neither praising adolescents or standing at a distance to laugh at them, it instead simply accepts them, warts and designer clothes and giant cellphones and all.

The film's emphasis on costume for all of its characters had a ripple effect and caused a heightened awareness of fashion amongst the girls of America in the midst of the boring 'grunge' phase of the nineties, helping to make girls pretty once again and re-introducing that one essential which can never be replaced: TRUE STYLE. After all, why should girls try to look ugly just in order to prove their equality with men? (Men can't help being ugly, but girls really have to work at it, so why bother.) They should instead try to be as pretty as can be in order to demonstrate their superiority. And hence the importance in the story of the hilarious 'makeovers' and attempts by the girls to out-trump each other by acts of style. This is the most wonderful satire of spoilt affluent Beverly Hills kids and their absurd class stratifications based upon money and 'popularity', that vague will o' the wisp which can vanish as the mist when the sunrise of real life takes place. Alicia Silverstone's cheerful and innocent personality, trapped as she is in a fantasy Beverly Bubble without even knowing it, really makes the film. She is simply irresistible and a natural comedienne. Never has shallowness been deeper! The satire is very pointed throughout the film, but is always laid on with affectionate and gentle mirth. After all, these deluded kids are not bad people, they are just helpless victims of their own vanity, stupidity, vapidity, and parents. One of the most hilarious characters in the film is Silverstone's father ('My daddy is a litigator, which is the most terrifying kind of lawyer.') Anyone who has known how ferocious litigators can be must have a good giggle seeing one at home who is out-witted at every turn not by an opponent in court, but by a smiling and teasing daughter. The satire on the appalling American school system is also so hilarious. All the kids sit texting and paying no attention to the teachers at all. The film is even more relevant now than when it was released in pre-history, or should I say the Pleistocene Era, meaning 1995. The film is brilliantly written and directed by Amy Heckerling, who has recently written and directed a new feature film starring Alicia Silverstone called VAMPS (2012) which I have not seen. Previously she wrote and directed a feature called I COULD NEVER BE YOUR WOMAN (2007) featuring Michelle Pfeiffer and Paul Rudd and Stacey Dash, who are both so brilliant in CLUELESS. So as a result of CLUELESS, a great deal of bonding evidently took place and there is now a Heckerling Family. Wallace Shawn, who hilariously plays Mr. Hall in CLUELESS was already her intimate friend and has worked with her at various times. How can anyone who has seen CLUELESS ever forget the romance between Shawn and Twink Caplan as Miss Geist? Silverstone's match-making between those two hopeless and gawky individuals was inspired by Jane Austen's EMMA, apparently. But Amy Heckerling needs no inspiration, she IS inspiration. This film is such a classic that I wonder if there is anyone with a sense of humour and fun who has not seen it by now. Merry Christmas and also Happy Hannukah and every variety of Seasons's Greetings to all clueless people, and may Santa slip the DVD of this wonderful gem into your stocking, just in case you are one of the unlucky ones who has never seen it before, or perhaps have lost your old copy and need a quick replacement, so that your holiday will not be incomplete and you will not suffer from lack of hilarity.",Clueless

48,Polaris_DiB,Elegantly loquacious in its own sorta way,6,7 October 2010,"In the 90s there was this sort of subgenre of Hollywood filmmaking that regarded the powers and potentials of the vapid blonde mindset. With movies like Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Clueless, filmmakers set about showing that there's more to blondes than meets the fashion-frenzied eye, though typically you have to know the language of fashion to understand it. I feel like Clueless is probably just about the best execution of this theme.Story follows Cher, overprivileged 16 year old rich kid Ms. Popularity extraordinaire, whose passion for involving herself in other people's affairs self-argued as helping others belies her own selfishness and inability to understand things outside her own values. However, with a combination of a no-nonsense lawyer father, a droll step-brother, and some silly mishaps, Cher comes to the stunning realization over not only what she really wants, but how selfish she's been trying to get it.This movie is an adaptation of Emma the way 10 Things I Hate about You is an adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew--you needn't really know the original text to understand it and it really operates less comparatively to the original text than the Paltrow-featured Emma. What you get instead is a rather funny modern screwball comedy, as Cher basically twists all the messages being sent to her to her own ends, only to be left all on her own in terms of understanding the messages. Indeed, early in the movie she says, ""This is Ren and Stimpy. It's way existential"" but later in the movie she actually comes to an existential crisis. I find it funny. I tend to find existentialists are not quite so amused.Nevertheless, Clueless is quite clearly satire and I find it amazing how well it was able to pull it off, particularly because Alicia Silverstone's loquacious cuteness in character makes her all the more endearable than the somewhat annoying tongue-in-cheek vapidness of movies like Legally Blonde. It is, indeed, easier to see what Josh ""sees"" in her.I don't really think that this subgenre has a whole lot of room, really, for more interpretation. Other movies on the power of pop culture, especially in the high school level, like Never Been Kissed at most end up feeling cute and at worst are, frankly, unbearable. Clueless is something I'd not mind watching again, even though I'm typically not very interested in the genre itself.--PolarisDiB",Clueless
49,dee.reid,"""Clueless,"" and still talking all that jazz",10,12 January 2007,"I remember just barely 11 years ago when my cousin and I watched ""Clueless"" at least once a day for about a week straight. Needless to say, she'd had enough after four days but I still craved more of director Amy Heckerling's ""Beverly Hills 90210""-Jane Austen's ""Emma"" cross-breed, this teen comedy from 1995.I'm a guy; I'll just leave that out there for you all to think about.There is something greatly charming about the beautiful, if not slightly air-headed Alicia Silverstone and her role as young Cher Horowitz. By the time she got this part, Silverstone was already the talk of the adolescent male world, and she had cut her teeth in music videos and 1993's ""The Crush.""Just for your information, Cher is pretty well groomed, attractive, well-to-do, bright, and charitable. In a wasteland of teen movies, you would expect ""Clueless"" to be up to the rim with sex and drugs. But Heckerling's direction and writing is much, much smarter than that. Despite its teen allure, Heckerling does away with all that jazz and decides to just focus on girl world - Cher's Southern California world of parties, boys, shopping, cellphones, jeeps, and clothes - with her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash), her litigator father (a world-weary, one-liner-spewing Dan Hedaya), and her uncool stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd).The arrival of a new student named Tai (Brittany Murphy) inspires Cher and Dionne to give the poor fish-out-of-water a makeover, and thus become her friends in the process. The outcome is astounding, nonetheless, and Tai takes an immediate liking to skater Travis (Breckin Meyer), but Cher instead ops stud Elton (Jeremy Sisto) for her. This deed and others inspire Cher to attempt one more miracle: bring together two lonely and mismatched teachers (Wallace Shawn and Twink Caplan).Cher is the atypical dizzy blonde we've grown accustomed to seeing in the movies over the years. But Silverstone gives her role a heart, and a lonely one at that. While she may seem great and beautiful on the outside, it's just a cover for her own insecurity and loneliness (who said that ""Clueless"" just had to be about girl world?) By the time Cher realizes that another hot, would-be beau (Justin Walker as ""cake boy"" Christian) isn't likely to return her sort of affection, she makes a startling discovery about who it is that does seem right for her.""Clueless"" is just plain old fun. Similar territory was covered in Heckerling's equally entertaining ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982), but that was 13 years earlier. Time has been necessarily good to this 1995 outing. I'm just glad to be able to write about it now, while I still can remember the good old days.10/10",Clueless

If you ask me, Cher (Alicia Silverstone) and Dionne (Stacey Dash) did a very good job giving Tai (Brittany Murphy) her makeover. Throughout the whole time I saw Tai, I was reminded of someone I attended middle school with. Also, when Murray (Donald Adeoseun Faison) got his head shaved, I was a little grossed out. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. However, I thought his teeth looked nice with the braces on them. There is a moral to this story, and that is, ""Be true to yourself.""

Of course, for me it all started with the original. For me, Cher Horowitz is one of the most significant female characters ever to have appeared on film. The movie introduced us to the way teenagers talked back then (during a different era) and, as somebody who writes stories for my own amusement, I have often been inspired by BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and CLUELESS to emulate that particular sassy, cute speaking style when it comes to penning my own heroine.Moreover, Cher might be vain and a fashion addict and appear superficial, but she is a warm-hearted, conscientious girl who considers the feelings of others, she is not really of the Me Generation, she is delightfully old-school, because of the Jane Austen's ""Emma"" influence, or because Amy FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH Heckerling's approach itself dates from a time when the world wasn't as self-centered as it is today.

This was a wholly unremarkable film to me, completely average, pure milk toast. Maybe I just waited too long, I've seen too many things inspired by this to really appreciate it now. Maybe it's because of how outrageously 90s it is, a 90s I really don't remember being like that so can't exactly relate to it. Maybe it has something to do with the semi-incestuous ending that felt breezed right over. Not that I blame them, I wouldn't want to focus much on that either, but there it was.This really feels like the sort of thing that just belongs on network tv to me. If it's on, it's harmless enough but it wasn't anything special to me. It just sort of happened.

60,a_chinn,"Charming comedy that's much smarter than it pretends to be, much like it's heroine",9,7 January 2019,"1990s high school set version of Jane Austen's ""Emma"" is pretty irresistible, thanks to writer/director Amy Heckerling's likable portrayal of young people and even more so thanks to an incredibly endearing performance by Alicia Silverstone. Silverstone's Cher is blond, beautiful, and the most popular girl in school, and who takes it upon herself to fix the lives of everyone around her (i.e. helping a new girl get popular, playing matchmaker with unhappy teachers, etc.), even if it's to serve her own ends. What intrigued me most upon rewatching the film is that Cher is the type of character who is usually the villain of these sort of films, but in this film she's the likable heroine. ""Clueless"" is also unique in that there really are no antagonists or villains, with the possible exception of Silverstone manipulating the lives of everyone around her, but although her actions are self serving at times, she's never mean or cruel, allowing the audience to still like her character. Cher is a unique character who plays at being a cute ditzy girl, but who is secretly (maybe even to herself) much smarter than she appears, which paved the way for copycat characters like Elle Woods in ""Legally Blonde"" or Romy & Michele or even Cameron Diaz' character in ""Charlie's Angels."" One might argue that Marilyn Monroe did this in some of her film, but the ditzy blond was more of her real-life act. I'm thinking the closest cinematic predecessor would be Holly Golightly form ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" but that film was tonally very different that characters manipulations were quite different. But I digress. Likable performances in ""Clueless"" are not limited to Silverstone and extend to the cast as a whole. Two standouts are Brittany Murphy as Silverstone's Eliza Doolittle to her Professor Higgins, and a young Paul Rudd play's Silverstone's college age stepbrother, who she describes as he dresses funny and listens to ""complaint rock."" Following this film Rudd could very easily have gone down the road of handsome leading man type of roles, but instead chose a different career path, which I think made him a more interesting of actor. While the cast deserves a lot of credit for the film's easy charm, writer/director Heckerling deserve credit for not only creating likable well rounded characters, she also fills the film with endless funny banter, such as:Josh: Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
Cher: No. Why, does it sound like I do?Or:Cher: Oh look, Josh is dancing with Tai, he never dances.
Christian: I can see why.Or:Cher: Would you call me selfish?
Dionne: No, not to your face.Or:Cher: If it's a concussion, you have to keep her conscious, okay? Ask her questions.
Elton: What's seven times seven?
Cher: Stuff she knows!Besides funny dialogue, Heckerling also has some fairly heartfelt dialogue that's sincere (and still funny) without ever becoming maudlin (SPOILER ALERT!):Everything I think and everything I do is wrong. I was wrong about Elton, I was wrong about Christian, and now Josh hated me. It all boiled down to one inevitable conclusion, I was just totally clueless. Oh, and this Josh and Tai thing was wigging me more than anything. I mean, what was my problem? Tai is my pal, I don't begrudge her a boyfriend, I really... Ooh, I wonder if they have that in my size. What does she want with Josh, anyway? He dresses funny, he listens to complaint rock, he's not even cute... in a conventional way. I mean, he's just like this slug who hangs around the house all the time. And he's a hideous dancer, I couldn't take him anywhere. Wait a second, what am I stressing about? This is like, Josh! OK, OK, so he's kind of a Baldwin, but what would he want with Tai? She couldn't make him happy. Josh needed someone with imagination, someone to take care of him, someone to laugh at his jokes... in case he ever makes any. Then suddenly...Heckerling made her directorial debut with ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" which was unique in it's honest depiction of teen life, and although ""Clueless"" is minus the explicit sex and drugs of Fast Times, the Clueless teens do live in a world that includes those real elements, but Heckerling makes it much more sweet and charming than Fast Times. The characters of Clueless are unique in that they are these sweet likable characters, but at the same time are not naive innocents. It's an interesting balance I realized I hadn't seen in many teen films, but I think it boiled down to the fact that the characters, while they do rib each other at times, are never mean, making the film incredible endearing. Also of note is the bright vivid photography by cinematographer Bill Pope (""The Matrix,"" ""Army of Darkness,"" ""Chasing Mavericks,"" ""Baby Driver"" etc.), who makes the colors pop and gives the film a pleasing looks and color scheme. Other supporting players of note include (now FoxNews commentator) Stacey Dash as Cher's best friend, Dan Hedaya as her high powered lawyer dad, Breckin Meyer as a skater dude, Wallace Shawn and Julie Brown as teachers, and ""Jaws"" screenwriter Carl Gottlieb as a priest. Lastly, I'm a huge fan of the General Public song Tenderness that's played over the film's finale and end credits, so it was kind of impossible for me not to fall in love with this movie. Overall, ""Clueless"" is a charming film that is much smarter than it pretends to be, much like it's heroine (how can a film that uses the ""Spartacus"" oysters and snails scene as foreshadowing be considered fluff?).",Clueless

Perhaps, but it's an inspired idea all the same.  Jane Austen's characters, and her readers, and the society in which her novels are set, like Jane Austen herself, are HEAVILY conscious of class and social standing.  No atmosphere quite so snobbish exists in the modern world.  EXCEPT, that is, in the corridors and courtyards of the right kind of high school.  And where else in the modern world would you find so many people who seem to spend all their time calling on one another?I was reminded of how well Heckerling moulded ""Emma"" to fit a modern setting when I saw the idiotic 1998 version of ""Great Expectations"", adapted by someone who somehow failed to notice how important all the stuff about class and snobbishness was.  It's clear that Heckerling understood her source. She isn't afraid to make changes - even radical changes, if the modern setting requires as much - and no character exists MERELY because they have an analogue in Austen's novel.  (The most crucial thing is that the Emma-equivalent be sufficiently charming; and so she is.)

I thought she was mild in The Crush, awful in Batman & Robin, and I can't think of anything else she is in. But she is great in Clueless. Clueless is her best film to date. Besides Ferris Bueller, it's the best teen comedy to date also. Clueless isn't like Superbad(Which I like also)where the whole film is foulmouthed. Clueless is girly and innocent, without the bad language. Listen, i'm not saying it's bad to cuss, because I cuss too. But some films should just lay low a bit on the cussing. Clueless is an awesome film with almost every likable characters. The character who I despise is Tai(Brittany Murphey) as this newcomer who becomes friends with the main characters and soon turns into this stuck up bitch. Perhaps i'm going a little out of the way, but Clueless is underrated. Clueless truly is funny and is one of the best teen comedies ever. If you haven't seen it before, than I think you sure should see it already.The Plot: Cher and her best friend Deon are rich girls living in Beverly Hills.

68,Stampsfightclub,Wonderful character development with a good slice of comedy,7,9 December 2009,"Cher (Silverstone) has everything. Cars, money, dresses but after doing a good deed for her teachers, she aims to do more good deeds for others and helps new girl Tai (Murphy) adjust to life at school.Perhaps its too easy to criticize high school or teenage comedies these days. If someone isn't sleeping with that person then that person is totally out of the picture.Depending on your outlook this will either have you laughing your head off or criticizing every single scene.Sadly I opted for the latter to begin with which ultimately caused me to miss out on the bigger picture of wonderful character development.Opening with a teenage slang talking socialite in Alicia Silverstone miss-matching her dress choice on an expensive computer system the tone is set for her protagonist. The pretentious highly classy and fashion orientated central person outlines the foundations of her existence in a few brief scenes. Her dad is a highly successful lawyer with her mum having passed away at her birth. She is not popular at school as such until good deeds with her match making abilities which include her grade reporting teachers send her on a journey of good will.This ideology initially is quite laughable as already outlined she is a self centred egotistical teenager but delightfully the script twists and turns through some wonderfully set up acts of heartache and happiness that really, like totally honestly, make this really cool, wicked or any other adjective, Alicia Silverstone would be hard pushed to be replaced. She is perfect at acting up her life in an exaggerated fashion that makes her an obvious target for others and her beautifully deft touch of slang might occasionally be interpretable for anyone over the age of 30 but there is no mistaking her facial expressions of contempt for her enemies and her delight when things go right for her friends.So, how does this compare to its rival Mean Girls? That 2004 picture revolved around high school and college groups, such as the Plastics and the art of stereotyping oneself to fit in. This, released in 1995 has a stronger base to the fact it is more clinical with its cementing of people and personas. Everything isn't drawn out but new things keep cropping up which ultimately make it stronger. Whereas Mean Girls is arguably a tad funnier this has a less conventional outcome and attack.This for me has wonderful character development. The plot outline of any romantic comedy drama shows character learning from their mistake and making amends but this is a carefully staged progression of teenager into adulthood, and with a great use of action comedy and twists and turns benefits because of it.There are faults in direction and exaggeration but ultimately this is, like, well worth it.",Clueless

There is one scene, which I won't spoil here, at the Driver's Licence Office, that is an absolute gas! I rated this film an 8, which is a high score from me. Alicia Silverstone can look back on her work on this film with pride - she's absolutely great in it.

Stacey Dash, plays Cher's best friend, Dionne. As Cher explains, ""This is my best friend, Dionne...we were both named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials."" This is an endlessly entertaining film filled with great laughs that introduces an entire new facet of ""teenspeak"" which I won't spoil by getting into here. A wonderful supporting cast of fresh-scrubbed faces, some of whom would become stars later includes Brittany Murphy, Donald Faison (SCRUBS), Breckin Meyer, Paul Rudd, and Jeremy Sisto. There are also expert comic turns from Dan Hedaya, in one of his sharpest performances as Cher's father, Wallace Shawn as a stuffed shirt debate teacher and screenwriter Twink Caplan, who is very funny as the fellow faculty member Shawn falls for, Miss Giest.

Nor would Amy Heckerling, who gave me and millions plenty enough to be sick and bored about in the ""Look Who's Talking"" movies. Nor Alicia Silverstone, who at the time was queen of the Aerosmith music videos on MTV before realizing she'd star in a film that looked like it would be too much sugar and spice to keep audiences from being too nice about it! After viewing CLUELESS (the film, that is), I was real surprised. The casting is brilliant from start to finish and the humor is very practical most of the time, which bodes well provided that 97% of all comedy movies really stale at being funny! ""Cher"" goes down to being one of the most memorable characters in numerous motion pictures, and you'll discover why Silverstone perfected that role that made it classic (c'mon Ms. Blanchard!). In fact, she often reminded me of Melissa Joan Hart (as ""Clarissa""). As a ""comedy"", CLUELESS easily ranks near the very top of my list. As a ""teen"" movie, it's the best one yet. This may have set a trend in recent teen girl acts, including SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, all of which have been a commercial success due to their appeal among teenagers.

77,FlickJunkie-2,Easy to like,8,11 February 2001,"Director Amy Heckerling knows a thing or two about high school flicks, having directed the highly successful `Fast Times at Ridgemont High'. Heckerling put her talents to work thirteen years later for the next generation of high schoolers, writing and directing this hilarious satire of life at Beverly Hills H.S.  Heckerling takes a different approach from `Fast Times', which found its comedy in the absurdity of reality, depicting situations into which teenagers really get themselves.  Here Heckerling's comedy mostly comes from mocking the superficiality of the high school `in-crowd'.  While this is not the first time this has been done, few have ever done it with such blistering wit.  This film became the standard for a spate of 1990's high school flicks set on the west coast that borrowed many of its elements.The story focuses on Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone), who is the most popular girl at Beverly Hills H.S.  Cher seems to be a superficial airhead, but this belies her conniving and manipulative skills at getting what she wants.   Superficial yes, airhead no!  In a plot derived in part from Jane Austen's `Emma', Cher works behind the scenes to arrange love matches between various students.  She even orchestrates a relationship between two teachers to improve their moods so they don't grade so harshly.  Like Emma, she is a master of love for everyone but herself.Heckerling does a fantastic job of presenting what seems on the surface to be a cotton candy story with lightweight characters, but really runs much deeper revealing subtle truths about human nature.  Her direction of the fledgling cast is superb, milking every ounce of comedy out of each scene.Silverstone sparkles in the role, which is probably not far from a reality with which she is very familiar.  She actually attended Beverly Hills H.S. with co-star Breckin Meyer, although she didn't graduate due to career commitments (she received a G.E.D.).  This film catapulted her to teen prominence with two MTV movie awards and an American Comedy Award as funniest actress in a leading role.  She plays Cher with both arrogance and vulnerability, and her comic timing is impeccable.  She also has a knack for physical comedy, with a broad range of contorted facial expressions and amusing use of body language.  The rest of the teen cast is also great, especially Brittany Murphy as Tai and Breckin Meyer as Travis.  Dan Hedaya is also priceless as Cher's work obsessed attorney father.This film is easy to like.  It is a light and funny spoof, but it still has nuance.  I rated it an 8/10.  For those who enjoy high school comedies, this is required viewing.",Clueless

Elisa Donovan is also great as Amber, the girl who you could say is jealous of Cher. Paul Rudd is also good as Cher's 'stepbrother' Josh. ***SPOILER ALERT***(Who Cher gets with at the end of the film.)***END OF SPOILER*** And, Breckin Meyer puts in a REALLY cute performance as the funny/dumb skateboarder Travis.

Most importantly, there are many funny, cheeky, sweet and naughty moments, so if you don't laugh or enjoy it, you are the problem.All the cast members are lovable and adorable in their respective roles. Paul Rudd is very charming as the sweet hard worker Josh. Alicia Silverstone has the role of a lifetime playing Cher Horowitz, and is extremely funny, as well as the almost unrecognizable Brittany Murphy as Tai; she still was herself and not a Hollywood minced product. Stacey Dash and Donald Faison are also terrific in their roles of the couple Dionne & Murray. Also very good is Elisa Donovan as Amber.Despite being filmed in 1995 the movie is still fresh, funny and very enjoyable, and only the fashion is a bit aged, but just a bit.A classic teen movie that is still fresh and funny.

Another cast member, Brittany Murphy (before she somehow got caught in the Hollywood cookie cutter machine, lost weight, and subsequently lost her uniqueness as well) is a standout as Jersey Girl Tai, who, like Murphy herself, is convinced that being herself isn't good enough, and she must ""conform"".It should be noted that although Cher is quite charismatic and of course beautiful to look at, her character is often condescending, hostile, inflexible and just plain snobby to those who don't think or look like she does. (She is terrible to Travis the Skater-boy (Breckin Meyer) and to Murray, the wanna be gangsta (Donald Faison.) That's a good thing, because, after all, she IS the one who is proved to be CLUELESS. She accuses her friend Elton (Jeremy Sisto) of being a ""snob and a half"" because he doesn't have any romantic interest in Tai, yet is totally oblivious to her own snobbishness.Paul Rudd is terrific (as usual) as Cher's ex-step-brother, who proves more than a match for her. She plans lots of schemes during the story, and he undermines her and infuriorates her with his refusal to be ""impressed"" or ""touched"" by her ""generosity"".A lot more fun than the 1996 EMMA movie, and a lot funnier to boot.I give it an A+.

If you responded, ""no"" you'd be way wrong. Writer/director Amy Heckerling, who had a winner with Fast Times At Ridgemont High in 1982, has done it again with some classic inspiration. Alicia Silverstone plays pampered Cher, a pretty high-schooler who lost her mother in a tragic accident during a routine liposuction. Cher's best friend is Dionne. Both were named for great singers of the past who now do infomercials, and they share an intense interest in boys, shopping and clothes. They never go anywhere without their cellular phones and wouldn't be caught dead in the Valley. Well, unless it was for a great party. Cher wants to use her popularity to make the world a better place, and she starts by doing a total makeover on a needy transfer student. She also proves adept at matchmaking.

It was also a weird choice to position Cher's relationship with her step brother as the one to root for. A bit bizarre.In addition, I just wasn't that interested in the plot. It played out like an average soap opera with its relationships and misunderstandings, and I know that the whole thing was supposed to be tongue in cheek and light and breezy but it didn't work for me.Clueless is loved by many but its far from iconic and pales in comparison to some of its peers like Mean Girls.",Clueless

86,Flagrant-Baronessa,Clueless: An near-perfectly updated classic,9,17 August 2006,"""Isn't my house classic? The columns date all the way back to 1972.""When romantic high-school comedy Clueless (1995) was released, it was immediately vaulted into cult-status and firmly stapled as one of the most original teen-flicks of the 1990s. 'Original' is perhaps a term wrongly applied since it is based on the queen of romance Jane Austen's Emma (1815) . But what Clueless did was update the classic story by coating it with high school drama, teenage girls and shopping and sprinkle it with heavy doses of humour.Emma is no longer Emma; she is Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a spoiled rich girl walking around in her Beverly Hills mansion in a bubble of stereotypes and teen-clichés -- but with a great big heart. So big-hearted, in fact, that she takes on the lost goofy new girl in her school to find her love and popularity, knowing full-well that it could destroy her own reputation. Clueless thus sees Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) on a mission to do good. Real good.All the detours this mission entail are captured brilliantly in the film, taking the form of love-interests, parties, shopping and misunderstandings. From Cher's grumpy lawyer-father (an hilarious Dan Hedaya) and her nerdy step-brother (a likable Paul Rudd) to her eccentric group of friends at school, Clueless is a superb ride of teenage comedy camp. Only just over 10 years old, it is still extremely dated today. But no matter, because the 90s clichés like skateboarding, Marky Mark and the catch-phrase ""As if"" just make it so much more contemporary and fun to watch. What elevates Clueless (1995) above generic high school comedy is its use of stereotypes. In most films they are unintentionally there to create a subconscious effect, but in Clueless they are made fun of to a much higher degree -- they are overblown and glorious. It brutally satirizes rich kids and their 'problems' and juxtaposes them with a classic, heart-felt love-story. The kind that only Jane Austen can write.9/10",Clueless

88,renegadeviking-271-528568,Clueless review,8,15 August 2020,": Catching up with the recent Emma. made me even more resolute in rectifying a huge void in my pop cultural catalogue and finally getting round to watching Amy Heckerling's Clueless. Based loosely on Jane Austen's novel 'Emma', it came at the beginning of that run where the high school movie was coming back in fashion with the likes of American Pie, and where it was co-opting classic literary narratives to freshen the brew - 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' for Get Over It, 'Pygmalion' for She's All That, 'Twelfth Night' for She's the Man, and 'The Taming of the Shrew' for 10 Things I Hate About You.What registers about Clueless is how absolutely assured it is of its own sublime sense of satire. It has this delightful level of disconnect like a pantomime, and if it wasn't live action it could almost pass for a literal cartoon - it is that flamboyant, wacky and colourful. It's almost like some pop art masterwork - from the '60s-style title sequence, to the crazy choreographing of the classroom scenes and the pool party, to the supremely sharp dialogue and Alicia Silverstone's droll voiceover.And talking about Silverstone, my only (slightly underwhelming) reference points to date have been her limp cameo in Batman and Robin and in the long-forgotten time-travel comedy, Blast from the Past. The air of vapidity about her and the slowness of her drawl is so right for the Beverly Hills princess with just enough self-awareness to redeem her from totally fulfilling the airhead stereotype. She is adorable here and actually quite touching; just the like the film itself.",Clueless

In some important ways I do find these Ultimates to follow in the footsteps of Clueless, I have to honour this feature.Minor pinnacles close to the heights of these two, such as Lindsay's Get A Clue. Ditto.Even a movie that I found a bit too scary to rate as in that range, Mini's First Time of 2006, seemed to follow in the footsteps, too. These are all more recent than 1995 and if the change in style is to reflect changes in actual girl culture then the flow of history is in big trouble.Those more in tune with recent features should find a lot more with a family resemblance. I do not place American Pie in this particular family. To me that is male and a different sort of thing. Himalaya sort of thing.Reading the IMDb user comments for Girl Interrupted I noticed a lot of adulation for Brittany Murphy, I could not understand it at all. This tells me why. It tells me that the adulation is reasonable. Looking to the actor details pages at IMDb tells me that the three main actresses suddenly got noticed in a big way after they appeared in this feature. This is an influential feature.Earlier stuff? Grease then Girls Just Want To Have Fun then Heathers feel to be among those clearly leading to Clueless.* A schoolgirrrl story about 15s played by 18s. To that I have to scream Get A Clue, which appears to have its roots in this feature.First viewing I did think that they were actual 15s. The IMDb details came as a surprise. Now, most of them do look a lot older, but Brittany Murphy can still stand out as a 15 if I avoid Get A Clue. As a kitten too, she is as someone tied up to be an easy to lead little lamb.So, a schoolgirrrl story that is fun to watch even after a few viewings during the first week of purchase. Lovers of traditional good or traditional Jane Austen might prefer to bin this one, maybe, maybe not, but some find this to be a disk that gets a lot of playing hours.* September 2009, I get the Whatever edition for its lots of background detail. This does appease my qualms, it is not made by fly on the wall as with Ridgemont but by what I can accept as okay ways. The Whatever background videos seemed to go out of their way to make that point and I had needed that.For me, this has to be one of the major pinnacles of DVDs.

She is, along with Reese Witherspoon, the finest comedic female actor alive. So who could upstage even a fledgling Murphy exhibition? Well Alicia Silverstone can, in perhaps the most restrained, mature and polished performance you'll see from a teenager.It's not going to tire your brain, but it should leave you feeling good and properly entertained, and if you don't laugh out loud at least 10 times then you must be in a coma!UPDATE: Following the sad passing of the young lady who since I wrote the above, went on to become my favourite actress ever, I urge you to watch this movie if you haven't already.

I heard plenty of good things about it and was very much looking forward to watching what is considered a 90s teen movie classic. Try as I might to enjoy my viewing experience, I couldn't quite hurdle the barrier presented by an obnoxious and ruthlessly clueless lead character.Cher (played with tireless busyness by Alicia Silverstone) is a rich spoiled 15-year-old student who manipulates everyone in her path, occasionally to their benefit. She possesses a pathologically enormous ego that makes it impossible for her to accept criticism or even the slightest suggestion that she is anything less than flawless. In her mind, she can do whatever she wants whenever she wants, and the world should simply bend to her will as soon as she smiles and offers a flimsy explanation.Cher is meant to be bubbly and charming, but she comes across as unbearable and jarringly self-centered. She deserves a comeuppance or at least some sort of learning moment. I kept waiting for the story to weave its way in that direction, to the moment when she realizes she needs to improve as a person, but it never really happens. Instead, inexplicably yet to the surprise of no one, she gets exactly what she wants. All of it. Shortly after she comes to the realization that she's in love with a certain boy, the two get together. She wins.
Does the story have a point? Is there a lesson? Unclear. If anything, we learn that spoiled rich girls get what they want, but we already knew that.Aside from Cher, many of the other characters are fairly likable. No one jumps off the screen due to a unique personality, but plenty of guys and gals exhibit enough life from scene to scene to make me smile. There's the dopey skater boy, the guy trying way too hard to look cool, the awkward new arrival, and the teachers who tolerate all matters of unacceptable student behavior.For as much as everyone lacks self-awareness, they show a remarkable acuity for assessing others. Cher rattles off descriptions of the various student groups that make up the school. Her explanations lack depth but so do the characters, so it's hard to hold that against her too much. And Cher isn't the only one capable of these keen observations. Her best friend Dion astutely describes a college guy as going through his ""post-adolescent idealistic phase."" Though, he is later seen reading a book by Nietzsche, so his nihilistic phase probably isn't far off.If we had a different lead character/narrator, I probably would have enjoyed this movie much more. Alas, Cher put a hard cap on this movie, preventing it from rising to anything beyond a mediocre and forgettable shrug.",Clueless

Clueless is a fantastic film, carried by a great director (Amy Heckerling), and an awesome cast. Alicia Silverstone is perfect as the film's protagonist, Cher (perhaps her defining film role?), but others in the cast match her: Stacey Dash is Dionne, Cher's best friend, Justin Walker is Christian, Cher's total-crush who is actually gay, and Elise Donovan as Amber, who although she doesn't get much screen time, her reactions to the other characters and situations are terrific, i often find myself watching her in the back ground rather than watching the focus. There are several ""teen stars"" in roles before they were famous, such Britany Murphy, Breckin Meyer and Nicole Bilderbeck.The story flows well, there are not really any slow moments, everyone seems to be having fun and the soundtrack is cool - plus Cher's wardrobe is awesome, i totally want one!

Instead of having a loser who's trying to climb her way up on the social ladder, as our protagonist, we have Cher- the most popular girl in school- as our main character and surprisingly, she wasn't a total bitch. She did appear too spoiled, but the humor added into the film, softened the blow and made me like her. She had good values even from the starting of the film. You could tell that she was a good person.Alicia Silverstone was a good Cher. They could have chosen better, but Silverstone did a good job. I just didn't like her voice. There were so many countless times when I just wanted her to stop commentating since her voice was annoying. Sorry. I loved Donald Faison who played Murray! Even though, I didn't like Stacey Dash as Dionne. Brittany Murphy did a great job as Tai! So did Paul Rudd (Josh), Breckin Meyer (Travis) and Justin Walker (Christian).The love stories were unpredictable. I didn't know who Cher would end up with! (SPOILERS) But gosh, when I finally realized who it was, I found myself rewinding the movie just to check if Josh and Cher were related. I asked myself several times, ""Wait. Aren't they brother and sister?"" I never would have expected that there was a relationship waiting to bloom! I would have preferred more development to be put in their relationship, though. I didn't even know it was going to happen until it did! I mean, they never showed signs of even liking each other!

110,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Iconic 90s film,9,17 May 2020,"One of my favourite 90s teen movies! It's so much fun and I never get bored of watching it. The characters have striking and loveable personalities, the dialogue is witty, the fashion and music is iconic.. what's not there to love? The movie is not dull or bland in places as we constantly follow the main antagonist (Cher) tackle and go through the hilarity and mishaps of being a teenager in California. I think that Cher is one of the best teen antagonists to have ever been written. Although she is rich, spoilt and popular, she's actually portrayed as a nice person. Although the movie never paints her as a saint, as she makes mistakes and acts selfishly in places, we watch her learn and grow from them whilst realising her own naivety and 'Cluelessness', making her not only a fun and infectious character to watch, but also relatable and therefore an admirable person. The movie also has a quirky and lovely charm to it that never fails to put a smile on your face throughout. I love the fact that although it's branded as a dumb teen movie, it's actually very clever and funny, and has a deeper meaning rather than being about some shallow teens. In fact, it paints teenagers in a fair and real way ; Naive, self obssessed, but sensitive and full of heart. All I can say is I think some of the teen movies today should watch and learn.

111,Travis_Bickle01,A pleasant surprise,7,22 August 2005,"I wasn't expecting much of this movie, until I started seeing it. It turned out to be quite entertaining. ""Clueless"" is about the shallow and rather stupid rich girl Cher Horowitz, who only cares about herself and how popular she is. But then she starts this kind of 'project', together with her best friend. One of the aspects of this project is about making a new silly girl of their school look as 'cool' as they are. This 'silly' girl is very well performed by Brittany Murphy. I hardly recognized her! The lead role is for Alicia Silverstone who gives an excellent performance as well. Furthermore there is another great performance Paul Rudd (who we also know as Phoebe's boyfriend in ""Friends""). Also Dan Hedaya and Breckin Meyer (Road Trip) are funny.Funny and very entertaining movie from the director of ""Look Who's Talking (Too). Definitely worth watching! 7,5/10",Clueless

I feel all good after watching this movie.Alicia Silverstone looked very gorgeous in this movie. Her character was beautifully written and she was able to portray the character of the rich and carefree teenager very well. This movie will make you fall in love with her if you haven't already. Paul Rudd was awesome in his role. Stacey Dash and Brittany Murphy were also amazing as the two best friends. Their respective comic timings were on point. Movies like this make me enjoy teen comedies. The 90's were such beautiful times when people actually spent more time outside interacting with each other rather than on gadgets.Overall it's a beautiful movie and definitely one of my all time favourites. It's a nice take on Jane Austen's novel and I enjoyed every bit of it. It is one of those movies I can watch over and over again. It is a portal which will take you back to the 90's and make you forget about all the terrible things in your life for 1.5 hours.

117,ChristianUnchained,One of the worst films ever made.,1,29 April 2013,"This is yet again another trashy adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma. It features downright stupid performances and writing featuring a story that is, even with its ""clever"" spin on it, cliché and downright 90's. It's incredible how terrible this film has aged, as there is purely not one thing that made me laugh, care, or interested. Actually, Clueless is just that. It is an emotionless smorgasbord of annoying ideas and teen angst that would be better left never considered and crafted into a film. A film is where we can explore the imagination of the director, experience convincing emotional reward from the cast, and be transported to a different world. Clueless is completely the opposite. The characters are stupid, contrived, silly, and downright unlikeable. There's no artistic value in any of the shots, as it is stuck in that weird 90's limbo of ""hey, the 90's are great, let's include everything that we think is great about the 90's in this film."" Yeah, that will work, but nearly 20 years later and this film is just plain ugly and gross to look at. Plus, all of the drug and teen partying content is nasty. The last thing we want are girls growing up and watching this and saying ""hey, going to parties, getting drunk, smoking weed (among other things) is a perfect way to become popular and find my soul mate!"" Really. REALLY? People actually enjoy this dribble? But I digress, just never ever see this film. While nothing is graphic or done strongly, the morals and messages that this film conveys are entirely too stupid to be believable, and I don't care if she changes her heart or becomes a better person or whatever.Only a simpleton would live like Cher, much less like this film. It belongs in the 1990's garbage bin.",Clueless
118,Calysta,Good time passer,7,25 January 2000,"""10 Things I Hate About You"" was a take off from William Shakespeare's ""The Taming of the Shrew"". More high school flicks using the Bard's work and throwing it into a time capsule for 2000 are on the way. Therefore, ""Clueless"" falls into the same category.Apart from choosing to go after Jane Austen's ""Emma"", the movie is wiser than some of the insults to great Shakespeare. Amy Heckerling chose to write and direct this at least three years before the terrifying trends using every available beautiful teenager on the Hollywood market.
Teenage romantic comedies are one of the few neglected genres on the market which has a below average scoring as far as decent entertainment goes, but are designed for the undemanding young crowds. ""Clueless"" is at least better than most of them. A generally funny, but silly script comprised with Beverley Hills setting and the aim of life directed towards the mall is a film that surprisingly works rather well. Most of the success is due in part to the performance of Alicia Silverstone, which remains her best performance to date. I can't say much about the silly T.V show, but this is good entertainment for teenagers. It's probably still too provocative to pick over ""Toy Story"" for the littlies. Rating: 7/10",Clueless

Curiosity kicks in as she figures out romance and fitting in to high school.The casting is really well-done, you'll recognize several familiar faces and everyone delivers superb performances. Donald Faison, Breckin Meyer, Paul Rudd, Brittany Murphy, the list goes on. I was surprised by how confident the material is approached here. I'm sure if someone else wrote the movie, it might have come across as pathetic and clichéd. Here, it's fresh and nearly flawless. Also, you don't have to be a girl to love this film. I'm a guy and I am a sucker for these kind of movies.Seriously, what can I say that everyone else hasn't said? This is excellent and anyone who is/was a teenager can easily relate to it.

They have giant mansions, swimming pools, hired help, cars, cute little outfits, and they parade around school trying to solve such existential problems as how to fix two teachers up to boost their report card grades, or whether their outfits match their shoes. Along the way, the characters - through their shallowness - mix and mingle and find romance in all the wrong places.But Clueless isn't about the plot, or the acting. It's a comedy where everything is exaggerated and yet nothing is taken for granted. More lines from this movie have made it into everyday vocabulary than perhaps any other in recent memory. If Beverly Hills has its own zip code, then Clueless invented its own social code. And for every satirical reference, there is a kind of morbid truth. For every joke, a reflection on the reality of being a teenager in the 90s. For every... well, OK, let's stop trying to make this more than it was.If you're expecting depth or wisdom, or even the meanings behind the book on which this is based (Jane Austen's ""Emma""), then forget it.

The dialogue and story is hybrid Beverly Hills meets Shakespeare and indeed there is much stage drama and slapstick to boot. But for me it's all about this most self-absorbed character in all moviedom, Cher, who comes out so golden & likeable and where in her deft performance the whole put up reveals itself.. in her angelic face.

I have seen all the adaptations of her books at least twice - and some like Emma - many times.When Clueless came out I did not go to see it. The very idea of ""Emma Goes to Beverly Hills and Becomes a Feckless Teenager"" appalling, to say the least. I read the favorable reviews and I still looked upon it with scorn.Then one day, lo and behold, there was nothing on TV but sports, junk or things I had already seen too many times, with one exception, Clueless.After the movie was over, I got out my copy of Emma and read it twice. Then I rented the Gwyneth Paltrow and the BBC versions and watched them twice. Then I rented Clueless and watched it twice. I realized that I owed Clueless a very large apology. Alicia Silverstone's Cher is Emma - gone to Beverly Hills - but no more feckless than Emma herself. Cher is pretty and rich and charming and smart. Like the original Emma, Cher has a father who dotes upon her and depends upon her to manage his household. Her early autonomy and her lack of real world experience leads her to the unfortunate conclusion that she is always right. And therein hangs the tale.So, if you love Jane Austen as I do, please do not be afraid to see Clueless. It is not a desecration of Emma; it is a migration of Emma's soul from the streets of an English village to the palm trees and glitz of Rodeo Drive.",Clueless

So when the new girl enters the school she decides to help her become popular. Cher and her friends go through relationships and breakups with all kinds of men.

Cher learns a lot about herself throughout this time, the main thing being she is in love with her college going, pretentious, ex-stepbrother (weird, gross, but funny). This comedy had me laughing quite a bit, the jokes hit well. The acting was mediocre at best, but the nature of the characters made up for that.

Paul Rudd has a surprisingly small role as Josh, Cher's brainy and handsome ex-stepbrother, who helps Cher grow.The acting is adequate all around, but the best acting comes from minor players like Brittany Murphy and Breckin Meyer (as the druggie Travis).",Clueless
133,Ryan_9,The ending ruined it for me,6,21 September 2020,"""Clueless"" was a decent film, but I wasn't a fan of the ending. I found it to be weird considering how their former step-siblings and got together. If you ask me, I thought it was incestuous. Despite being weird, I thought Alicia Silverstone (Cher Horowitz) and Paul Rudd (Josh Lucas) both acted well. Silverstone was perfect for the role of Cher as she really fit the personality of a high school girl. Her character development was great. I liked Britney Murphy (Tai) and thought she played the part efficiently.I thought the humor was alright with Dan Hedaya (Mel Horowitz) being the funniest. His constant rage was nicely done. Other than him, there wasn't anyone else who stood out.I understand why this has gained such a cult following because of it being a teen movie. ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" are some popular teen movies that came out prior to this one, and look at the legacies they've had. Also, I'd take Fast Times and Ferris Bueller over Clueless any day. It seems like teen movies are a genre that everyone can relate to, considering how at some point in our lives, we're all teenagers.Overall, I'll give ""Clueless"" a 6/10. The ending killed it for me, but I didn't entirely dislike the film as there were some parts I enjoyed.",Clueless

138,minnow-6,You just know everyone is going to live happily ever after,9,26 July 2000,"`Clueless'.  ****.  (1996, USA, PG-13, 97 min. Directed and written by Amy Heckerling with Alicia Silverstone, Stacey Dash, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd, Dan Hedaya, Wallace Shawn, Twink Caplan).  Let me begin with a confession, I wasn't a fan of Jane Austin.  I'd never read a Jane Austin novel. (I've read all her novel since I wrote this review.) Thus, I watched `Clueless' sans benefits of any knowledge of `Emma' or any other of Jane's stories or characters.  Yet `Clueless' which is based on Jane Austin's `Emma' is one of my favorite movies of 1996. The characters are all good looking.  They are smart, resourceful, individuals.  Cher (Silverstone) is a stereotypical Valley Girl high school student.  She lives with her widowed and divorced father (Hedaya).  He's a very successful lawyer, always working on the next big case.  Cher and her best friend Dionne (Dash) are majoring in everyone else's life.  Cher explains she and Dionne are best friends because they both know what it's like to have everyone jealous of them.  Grades? Cher isn't the best of students but she negotiates with her teacher's for better grades.  And when the charm doesn't work, Cher assumes it's because they (the teachers) aren't happy.  Everyone knows happy teachers give higher grades.  Two of the unmarried and unhappy teachers (Shawn and Caplan) become a Cher project. `Clueless' lets us watch Cher deal with all the stresses of matchmaking, helping the new girl (Murphy) with a make over, driving lessons, and taking care of her father and everyone else.  Through all this and much more Cher begins to realize that she's missing a Mr. Right in her life.  Reflecting on her life she wonders how she could be so clueless.  But Cher is smart beyond the airhead remarks that get her through a day at school.  And when she really needs someone to listen to her she can go to her dad.  (I really liked this part of the movie.  Parents don't need to be bumbling fools to be part of a teenage comedy.) Does it all sound a bit corny?  Yeah, but the humor is clever and smart like the characters.  The characters are in on most of the jokes and at story's end every girl has a boyfriend; every boy a girlfriend.  Mr. Hall and Miss Geist (the two lonely teachers) are getting married.  Dad's ready for the next big case.  Even Cher's found Mr. Right.  You just know everyone is going to live happily ever after.  And if they aren't, I don't want to hear about it.  I liked this movie just the way is; four stars worth.",Clueless

I remember seeing the hype and trailers that accompanied the release of Clueless, and I probably made a mental note to avoid it like the plague, I was sure I'd hate it.I was very pleasantly surprised by Clueless, it mocks all those pathetic US teen/high school TV series where all the pretty people live in some kind of fantasy land. Those shows make me want to pull out what's left of my hair. Those shows are as fake as a politician's sincerity.Alicia Silverstone is at her best as Cher, a character you just have to love and hate at the same time, but the real star of the show is the script, the dialog is absolutely hilarious and I'd guess it's aimed at a slightly more mature audience than the characters in the film, I think many teens would miss some of the irony.If you've never seen it, avoided it, or thought you were too old for it, give it a chance. You too might be pleasantly surprised.",Clueless
142,marspeach,Funny but not a masterpiece,7,2 May 2011,"Clueless (1995) stars Alicia Silverstone as Cher Horowitz. Like Emma, she is rich and lives with her single father (IIRC, her mother died during plastic surgery, but I may be wrong). Here she is only 15 and already has her own car (before she even has a license!) and spends most of her time with her best friend, Dionne (no book equivalent). The Mr. Knightley character is played by her ex step-brother, Josh, played by Paul Rudd. The movie loosely follows a lot of Emma's plot lines. Cher hooks up two of her teachers and from there gets it into her head to be a matchmaker. She decides to give this version's Harriet Smith, new girl Tai (Brittany Murphy), a makeover and to hook her up with Elton. She convinces Tai that her crush, stoner Travis, is no good. Things backfire for her when her matchmaking plans not only fail but Tai eclipses her as the most popular girl. She goes after Christian (Frank Churchill), and although he's not a cad like Frank in the book, he has other reasons for not going for Cher.Some people think Clueless is the best adaptation of Emma, but I'd have to disagree. I did quite enjoy it and even used to watch the TV spin offI was in grade school, okay! I blame this movie for popularizing Valley Girl speak throughout the country, but that's another story. I really liked the characters of Cher and Josh and their sibling-esque rivalry that blossomed into love and a lot of the parallels with the book were funny, but this isn't one of my favorite movies or even adaptations. I found many of the characters just annoying and not charming at all. I also think this movie treated some inappropriate behaviors too lightly. Maybe I'm just too traditional, but all of the references to sex and pot smoking (Cher disapproves of Travis constantly being stoned but feels no qualms about occasionally smoking a joint at a party) made me a bit uncomfortable. Cher also seemed to think she was the last virgin left at her high school, and tried miserably to seduce Christian. Tai, despite being a ""loser"", oddly has had plenty of sexual experience. The characters were only 15 years old, for Christ's sake! I suppose stuff like this is more realistic (or even not realistic enough!) but part of the reason I watch period films is to escape from reality. I suppose that's why this updated version bothered me a bit.",Clueless

Every time I meet someone who loves this movie, I mention that it was based on Jane Austin's ""Emma"".  Then they usually reply with either ""No it wasn't!"" (in a high pitched Valley Girl squeal), or ""Who's Jane Austin?"".  One lady thought that Jane Austin was a comic book artist. Now, this doesn't really suprise me, after looking at the main character, Cher (who doesn't doubt that Alicia Silverstone is actually like this is real life?)  She spends all her time worrying about clothes and boys, instead of school or maybe getting a decent job.  That also sums up most of America, now that I think about it.",Clueless
144,cathyyoung1,"Delicious, smart, funny",7,11 May 2000,"It is widely known that ""Clueless"" is an adaptation of Jane Austen's novel ""Emma"" -- moved from 1800s England to 1990s Beverly Hills.  And an excellent adaptation it is.  While it is very doubtful that any standard-length film could match the psychological complexity and character development of Austen's classic, ""Clueless"" captures the novelist's favorite theme of skewering social pretensions (albeit more gently than Austen did!).  Just like ""Emma,"" ""Clueless"" portrays a privileged young woman whose snobbery and arrogance blind her to many of life's realities and cause even her best intentions to go awry -- until she's taken a peg down and redeems herself.I don't especially care for teen flicks, but this is a smart, funny with a lot of really great lines in it.  Here's one that is not included in the IMDB movie quotes list.  Cher to the Division of Motor Vehicles worker who failed her on the driving test: ""Isn't there someone else I can talk to? Surely, you can't be the absolute and final word in drivers' licenses!"" DMV worker: ""Girlie, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Messiah of the DMV!"" By the way, the entire driving test scene was simply hilarious -- one of the best comedy moments in any recent movie.  An excellent, dead-on performance by Alicia Silverstone, with a very good supporting cast as well.****** POSSIBLE SPOILERS **************Just a couple of things that didn't work very well in the translation from novel to movie.(1) In ""Emma,"" Mr. Elton, the vicar Emma is trying to fix up with Harriet Smith, the counterpart of Tai in the movie, asks for a portrait of Harriet which Emma sketched -- as it turns out, not because he's in love with Harriet (as Emma thinks) but because he's courting Emma, and the sketch is her work.  In ""Clueless,"" the sketch is replaced by a photo of Tai taken by Cher, which Elton puts up in his locker.  It doesn't quite work because a photo (unless it's by a real artist) isn't really a personal expression of the ""author,"" in the same way that a sketch is.(2)  In the novel, the dashing Frank Churchill (the counterpart of the movie's Christian Stovitz) pretends to court Emma as a cover for his engagement to a governess whom his family would consider undesirable (because she's poor).  In the movie, Christian is gay (openly enough that Dee's boyfriend knows all about it).  Why is he acting, at least in the beginning, like he's attracted to Cher and not just interested in her a friend?  Why doesn't he tell her the truth when it becomes very clear that she's attracted to him?  Is he trying to conceal the fact that he's gay and use her as a cover?  I think that basically Amy Heckerling was just too nice to make Christian look unpleasantly manipulative, the way Frank is in the book.However, these are mere quibbles.  Overall, a minor but delightful work.",Clueless

However, in spite of myself, I couldn't help but be taken in by the film's infectious charisma.  I thought the entire cast was simply charming - especially Ms. Silverstone. Dan Hedaya was classic, as always.  And the one liners.... well they still get me chuckling after re-watching dozens of times. Granted, we're not mining any new territory here, or inspiring any earth shattering revelations, the subject matter is pretty mindless.

It's consumately likable, funny, sweet and sharp- the script is a killer, and the acting is fun and enjoyable.Part of the success of the film is due to the fact that it appeals to several different audiences, and on multiple levels. I first watched this movie with my mom, who loved the link it has to Jane Austen's Emma- all the main characters and the plot are direct modern equivalents to the novel. For instance, the famous passage in Emma inwhich Harriet burns all her ""mementos"" of Mr. Elton becomes the scene where Tai does so infront of Cher's gasfire. From this perspective alone, the movie is so fun and sharp to watch- even if your forte isn't usually American Teen High School comedy!But this movie works on a really dumbed down scale too- let's face it, not everyone is big on English literature. The movie has an awesome soundtrack, Paul Rudd is unbelievably cute as ""Mr Knightly"" or rather Josh- and my boyfriend leads me to believe that the same is true of Alicia Silverstone- who still sparkles 10 years later as a mid-nineties teen queen with good intentions, Cher. Her performance here is impossible not to warm too, unless you have some sort of grudge against Valley girls, inwhich case you might not like it so much.

Now Clueless may not be for everyone but it is intelligent in an airheaded way. Now I must confess that I am a 14 year old girl but I do read and I am not satisfied by any old chick flick (and Clueless is the definition of chick flick). The acting is wonderful and the screenplay is amazing (those who say it is not witty need their head examined). I don't think that I know anyone who didn't like it. I can't decide which is better Emma or Clueless but I think Clueless is just a hair above Emma (Though Gwyneth Paltrow is the most talented actress of our days).

162,LuxuriousWoman,Pretty good movie,7,17 January 2017,"The movie is about a high school named Cher taking a girl under her wing and bringing her in the popular clique.CharactersCher is a shallow rich girl, along with her shallow friend Dionne, who's dating a popular guy named Murray. She has an ex stepbrother named Josh who's a freshman in college. The girl she takes under her wing is Tai. Tai has a crush on Travis. Her new gay best friend is Christian.CritiquesI honestly am annoyed with Cher for most of the movie. She proves her stepbrother right, that she only does things to benefit her, when she takes Tai under her wing just to get an ego boost. She views Tai as a project and something to control (she controls her looks, who she dates, etc). I honestly don't feel bad for Cher when Tai gets more popular than her and becomes a shallow attention wh*re; she honestly wanted Tai to be a shallow b*tch, but now she mad that it backfired on her. She plays the victim when most of her problems were caused by her: her getting a C, Tai becoming more popular, the maid being mad at her, failing her driving test, Tai liking Josh, etc.Then again, I also don't like Tai either. Her being a shallow snob is ironic considering that she cried about being rejected by a shallow snob. That blow she sent to Cher about being a v*rgin that can't drive was cruel and crossed the line. All Cher said was that they don't mesh and Tai took that to mean that Josh was too good for her. Um??? Two people not meshing does not hint to inferiority/superiority, it means that they wouldn't get along. I didn't go well with a guy that liked me because he was the type that would literally have an argument with me in public if he was mad enough, and I don't like having arguments or embarrassing moments in public. We didn't mesh because we conflicted and fought over that. Nothing to do with being too good for someone.Though to give Cher credit, Josh is kind of too smart for Tai. Josh obviously wants someone who is intellectually simulating and creative/innovative. Tai was the type that let others mold her, so she isn't very creative to be honest. They wouldn't work out in the long run.In the end, Cher actually redeems herself. She starts helping others because she cares, not because she needs an ego boost. Cher admits that she was wrong in the feud with Tai, and Tai also admitted that she was wrong as well. Cher also learned that there is good and bad in everyone, and to stop trying to change people! It's important to note that her debate teacher and the tree hugger got married in the end, so even if Cher set them up for selfish reasons, they still ended up happy because of her.OverallThe movie was great. Even when Cher was unlikable, she was fabulous and hilarious. Her friend Dionne was amazing and fashionable as well. Josh was hilarious with his jabs at Cher. Christian was great as well, and he was beautiful. The only critique I would say is that Dionne didn't get much character development, and she's a main character. Josh also didn't get much character development either.",Clueless

Dan Hedaya is as great as always, and the supporting characters from her school are first rate.This movie is a far more faithful version of a Jane Austen novel than many other efforts.

174,suzy-60,Witty and smart,10,9 June 2007,"This movie is yet another of those myriad recent movies that takes a classic story (in this case, Jane Austen's Emma) and transposes it to a modern high school. We saw it with Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew in 10 Things I hate About You, Othello in O, Twelfth Night in She's the Man, and George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion in She's All That (if I remember correctly).What sets Clueless apart from all of the following is the fact that, whereas the other movies did little more than take the main premises of the classic material and let the rest of the story morph into a generic high school flick (for example, 10 Things transports only the first half of the play into the movie and ends in a much different way), Clueless sticks to Austen's story, and the satiric tone of Austen's story (as translated to Beverly Hills) all the way through. ""Emma"" is perhaps an easier story to stick through to the end, and its tone is much more easily transposed to film, and book geeks will love ticking off every beat of Austen's story as it occurs on screen.Add to this some great acting, several sweet (but not saccharine) love story subplots, and some zany humour (Cher's mother died in a freak accident during a routine liposuction...) and you've got possibly the greatest high school film ever made.",Clueless

Fans of Jane Austen's EMMA will boost this rating at least a half star, as they watch in awe as Heckerling (so faithfully somehow) updates the early 19th century novel.

176,jerome-23,Bright and Classic Star Building Comedy,10,24 July 2006,"This film is a bright, teen and young adult comedy. It is a strong and classic star building vehicle. A 19-year old Alicia Silverstone shines angelically playing the 15-year old top-of-her-class, popular school girl, heroine Cher. A good, at ease and apt supporting cast including an almost typecast awkward acting Brittany Murphy and a young Dr. Turkleton from Scrubs, help the feelgood factor.Very contrasting and neon, and to contrast that, stylish and fashionable. This is Beverly Hills High life, showing the cream of Earth's monetary crop as an inspiration and simple idolatry. Both Alicia and Breckin attended BHHS and this shows positively in their ease in the environment. The classic mix of modern late-C20 upper class American life acting the classic literature of Jane Austen's Emma make an intriguing aimiability. The excellent dialogue has Cher self-deprecatingly referencing Hamlet to Mel Gibson's version, whilst quoting Sonnet 18 via a pop culture icon, part of a verbal, intelligent and resourceful upcoming elite. Words are spoken like litigator, travesty and misogynistic. This (expensive) professional catered for world includes masseuses, tennis coaches, plastic surgeons and cell phones.The title is a parodic statement on the heroine's insular knowledge. Dear Cher states to Josh that she thinks Bosnia is in the Middle East, its a different climate. Cher shares her popularity. She expresses mature concepts; the defferment of sexual satisfaction, the risk of deprecation to further another, and the charitable donation of possessions. Her friend Elton also shows an instance of risk to help another and this throws the film slightly, enabling Cher to take a reflective moment, discovering another goal, to be important to one, from being important to all.Drug usage is filtered, cannabis appears in the heroine's social experience although not to any great level. Travis constantly excuses himself from study, whether to escape the possibility for learning, doubtful for one in his social position else possibly to self-intoxicate. The audience is shown Elton using Cher to provide him with drug money. Besides this he is so retro that he evokes the only social comment from Cher's dad. The student's social life is shown enjoying house parties, clubs, and adding superfluous adjectives to their speech such as way and totally.Amy Heckerling's direction of the camera is good, direction of the cast is very good and her professionalism is evident. The projection of Cher as a world figurehead is played very well. Often putting things in her mouth, including color-co-ordinated gum, and self-referencing this tactic. A note to how the smaller, more insignificant occurrences are remembered by the kids is made.The decision is made that happier teachers, as the wealthier teachers are, produce better grades. An interesting item of note is Cher refers humorously to college music as maudlin. Magdalen College in Oxford University, England, is pronounced Maudlin.The money is shown but the businesses bringing the money and the lawyers is not shown. The valley liquor store at night, boutiques, the mall, yet no computing, banking, or other big business.Nice houses, furniture, and clothes. The play of using contrasting colors, becoming fashion in mixed plaid and tartan, as the individuals themselves become subtler colored after social interaction, also Cher experiments with a nice black & white, and grey color scheme later in the film.This is a unique and classic avante guarde film.--- by Jerome, computer coder, author, and voter of 1,000 films.",Clueless

Alicia was sooo perfect for the part.  I'm not saying it was a good part to play, but she definitely was the only one that could play Cher.  The only thing about this movie is that I don't like the Valley party scene.  It got a little boring after watching it fdor the 50th time.  Anyways, I love the language, the clothes, and the school.

Brittany as Tai is fab and Paul Rudd as Josh is just gorgeous! You'd think you'd hate some rich, Beverly Hills girl for obvious reasons but you end up just really feeling for her as you get to know her as the film goes on.

But it's not that at all, just saw it a few weeks ago and it's just this fun and loveable movie that is light hearted and really funny. There is no big villain to overcome and the lead character is strange in a good way in that she is the ditzy rich popular girl but she is not mean and is actually really caring and helpful towards others. The cast is great and a lot of the lines are really funny. I lol'd HARD more than once. And I think the amorphous thing about the movie that is really key is just that I felt happy and in a great mood while watching and afterward. I've since watched it more than once and each time it just puts me in a great mood!Alicia - Ok, so I was 14 or 15 when she was in The Crush and for high school/junior high kids I think it was fairly well known because MTV made a big deal out of it at the time. Well I watched The Crush and thought she was really cute, then the Aerosmith videos came out and thought she was crazy sexy and cute at the same time. So my experience of Alicia until a few weeks ago watching this was crazy girl in the Crush and sexy silent girl in Aerosmith videos. While watching Clueless I was really shocked at how funny she can be and just how great at acting she is. Like super impressed. It changed my view of her as kind of just this young sex icon to a real deal actress. Now, having said that, I've also got to say that there were times and scenes in Clueless where it's literally just jaw dropping how gorgeous she is. It's almost unbelievable, like she doesn't have this stereotypical killer bod or anything - she's just GORGEOUS.

Alicia Silverstone is just truly wonderful as Cher, she sets herself out to help her friends and just about everybody else with their relationship problems. The reason she Ne does it? Because she is lonely and doesn't want to face up to her own problems. Stylish and very sharp is how I would describe this film which was directed by Amy Heckerling. Amy has also directed National Lampoons European Vacation, Fat Times at Ridgement High and one of my favourite John Travolta films Look Who's Talking. The screen play is just excellent its clever, hip, funny and sharp.

In addition the convincing but unobtrusive acting helps to create a trustfully atmosphere. Also, the classic love story seems to be just one of many perspectives and themes around this movie.

But when she realizes Tai might be getting more popular than herself and when she finds out her crush is in fact gay, she has to admit she's totally clueless.This is one of the best movies ever!

They do look down their noses at people but then they feel bad about it and do something nice. This movie has so much fashion and ""as if"" jokes. The best scene is when Cher gets out of the car is trapped in a low income area. She gets robbed but nothing physically bad happens to her. I also liked Dione.

Adopted VERY loosely from ""Pride and Prejudice"", Clueless is the story of Cher Horowitz, a 16 year old ""virgin who can't drive"" from Beverly Hills, CA. A nice girl, but often without a clue about other people's feelings, or even her own, she has the usual anxieties and problems of an upper-middle-class girl of her time and place. She lives with her divorced father, a litigator, and her ex-step-brother (son of her father's second wife, now divorced from him). Cher attends a high-class high school with her friends, and is trying to learn how to drive a car and to navigate through life and love. She falls in love first with Christian, who dresses well, also had divorced parents, is very cute, and is brave and loves old movies and shopping. But that doesn't go as planned.... He's gay. After failing her driver's test, losing one of her best friends, fighting with her ex-step-brother, and drinking too many cappuccinos, she realizes, perhaps too late, that (1) college guys don't like high school girls, because they wear too much make-up, (2) doing a deposition digest for litigation is very difficult, and (3) she's not that good a person as she thought. She tries to become a better person by doing good deeds, like donating her skis to flood victims, match-making two of her teachers, getting a friend off pot, and helping her father with a difficult case.

199,groktalo,A witty parody on life of high school kids from wealthy backgrounds,10,2 March 2013,"""Clueless"" is one of the classic teen movies from the 1990s. It is feel-good, hilarious and witty.A majority of teen movies tend to involve exaggerated characters, grotesque behaviour and bland dialogues. Not this one.The lead female character, Cher, is spoilt, arrogant, manipulative, good-looking, fashion-obsessed and a daughter of a rich lawyer. Her attempts to help the others improve their personal lives are either motived by her selfish interests or are helpful distractions from her own loneliness, which is mainly a side-effect of her arrogance. Despite all that, her character is in fact very likable, simply because there is no real malice in anything that she does. Plus, she is a genuinely caring daughter. Even her needling jokes at the expense of her a couple of years' older ex step-brother are in fact relatively benign reactions to his unjustifiably stereotypical opinion of her.The other characters are very entertaining and tend to end up looking a lot deeper than what a viewer might think of them when they are first introduced. This is actually quite a refreshing trait of this film.Anyway, what really sets this movie apart from much of the rest of the genre is an abundance of witty retorts. This is what makes you not feel like you can hardly wait for the predictable ending.In sum, ""Clueless"" is one of the very few movies from the teen comedy genre that I cannot fault.",Clueless

One of the biggest things I wasn't a fan of was the rushed ending. Seemed like close to the 3rd act, a couple of characters made a 180 in personalities, but then by the end all was well and returned to normal.

204,mrgica-59845,Overhyped,3,5 July 2020,"I recently watched Mean Girls on Netflix and loved it. Since I really liked that movie and saw that Clueless was supposed to be a similar movie, I decided to give it a go. I wish I didn't. (TL:DR at the end).The thing that bothered me a lot about this movie is that I can't see what the plot is. IMDB says it's about a girl who makes her teacher fall in love, but that plot was over in the first 10 mins of the movie. The teachers get married at the end of the movie and invite their students (???) to the wedding.Netflix says it's about a popular girl giving a 'clueless' new girl a makeover, but the clueless girl, Tai, literally just randomly disappears for 30 mins and the first scene she's in again is her hanging from the fence of a mall because some two guys were 'joking'. Couldn't you go to jail beacuse of this?? Oh and btw the MC Cher gets mugged and is held at gunpoint and doesn't tell her dad or the cops.The 2nd thing is that Cher, the MC, is so annoying. It's hard for ms to like a movie when I want to punch the MC in the face. She literally constantly comments about others appearance and gets good grades by convincing teachers to give her better grades. I was honestly kinda pissed when she gave Tai a makeover because Tai actually had a cute style and they just turned her into... every popular girl. The thing is that I honestly hate how Cher dresses, it's just the basic 'rich popular girl' style. Then after Tai is rescued from the mall she later tells Cher she likes Josh, Cher's ex-step brother (?). Cher gets mad and storms out only to realise she doesn't like the idea of T+J dating is beacuse she is ALSO in love with Josh. But in the middle of the scene where she realises that she randomly walks into a store and buys a dress. She gets better by the end of the movie though, I'll give her that.The writers tried to push 'as if' as an 'iconic quote' but everytime Cher would say it I'd just die inside beacuse her voice would get wayy too high.Most of the characters are kinda one-dimensional, they're just... stereotypes and we don't know anything about their life (except Cher).You could tell that the acting improved in the middle, guess the actors were learning on set. The music's good too.Didn't mean for this to be so long and it kinda turmed into a rant but whatever.TL:DR - movie doesn't have a plot, annoying MC, one-dimensional characters, the acting improves, weird 'quotes', good music choice",Clueless

Brittany Murphy, and Stacey Dash are great as well, as her two gal pals. All the characters are great in their own way. Dan Hedays is hilarious as Cher's dad. This is definitely one of the 90s teen comedies at its best, and it never gets old either. I saw this for the first time at around age 8, and at 21 I still love it.

215,Pythius,Hilarious satire,9,19 November 1998,"Hilarious adaptation of Jane Austen's ""Emma"" to the screen in the context of spoiled Beverly Hills girls, Cher and Dionne. This is the film that made Alicia Silverstone a star and it is easy to see why. Silverstone practically makes the character her own, which may be a worry considering its nature, and this could explain why the subsequent sitcom didn't rate nearly as highly. Amy Heckerling, writer and director, skilfully pokes fun at the various stereotypes evident in Beverly Hills culture, at the same  time as encouraging the audience to retain sympathy with the main characters, however spoiled they may appear to be. Like Emma, Cher is honest and reliable, despite her faults, and she is seen to have good intentions at heart. This is partly what makes us sympathetic to her boy and friend troubles. Using constant cultural references (""Baldwins"", ""Friends of Dorothy"" etc) Heckerling's script roots itself in its own generation, which may hamper its becoming a classic, but it is doubtful that that was ever the intention anyway. The film is backed up by a bright soundtrack, mirrored by the colourful mise en scene. It never, despite the high drama, seems to rain much in Cher's world. The colours and styles of the fashions, often an integral theme, seem to be burlesques of actual fashions although, in all likelihood, they are quite earnest. Silverstone is backed up by a truly talented support cast, including the always engaging Breckin Meyer and Stacey Dash, who's Dionne always perfectly complements Silverstone's Cher. Also featured is a superb performance by Justin Walker as Cher's would-be boyfriend and it's a bit surprising that he hasn't gone further based on his effort here. All in all, ""Clueless"" is an engaging and genuinely hilarious film, which, with ""Reality Bites"" and ""Empire Records"" could well become earmarked as a symbol of its decade.",Clueless

The movie wasn't great or anything, and I wouldn't want to watch this again soon, or ever, but it wasn't bad.My main problem is that I saw everything that was going to happen before it happened. It was obvious that one guy was gay, I knew that the step-siblings were going to get together, and many other details were too obviously going to happen.The movie ended abruptly, not answering some things that I was looking to know.

217,doyobimas,"""He does dress better than I do, what would I bring to the relationship?""",7,24 June 2013,"Clueless is almost a film about nothing. We follow the story of sixteen-year-old schoolgirl Cher who is popular, rich and beautiful, and has everybody around her at her fingertips. She's manipulative, selfish and a snob who seems to only have one other high school friend Dionne. Yet despite her major flaws that would generally have the audience hating her, we don't. Cher comes through as a character we really adore and care about due to one major reason, her childish innocence or as the title of the movie puts it her cluelessness.The general synopsis of the film follows Cher (Alicia Silverstone) as she attempts to con and manipulate her teachers into increasing her low grades. A feat her lawyer father encourages and praises her for. She soon gets a taste for meddling into peoples lives and takes in upon herself to give a new girl at the school Tai (Britney Murphy) a makeover and spring her into popularity. Much of the story then follows her naivety in controlling other people and the dynamics of her friendships with a loose love story coming into play towards the end. Despite the weak plot much of what makes Clueless work well as a film is the subtle humor and innocently naive characters you grow to appreciate. It's the film that propelled Alicia Silverstone into the Hollywood spotlight, and of course was also the late Britney Murphy's break through role. It's a high school movie classic that will cause you to laugh out loud many times and a must see for the 90s nostalgia. If you really enjoy the movie check out the 90s follow up TV series of Clueless which see's much of the cast from the movie reunited minus Miss Silverstone.",Clueless

Realizing how wrong she was, she re-examined her own life and tried to think more about how self-absorbed she was.I really enjoyed the process of how Cher changes from the beginning to end.

That's all, there's no message except to being a better person.However the movie is a silly little piece of fluff. I wouldn't reccomend it. If you want to see a great film that's more true to Jane Austen's Emma, check out the 1996 film of Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow.Or if you're a teenager you might want to check out Legally Blonde with Reese Witherspoon.

In a world where actresses like Lindsay Lohan and Cameron Diaz are constantly being thrown in our faces, I really wonder how Alicia Silverstone never had a bigger career. She made a brilliant performance as Cher, and it was refreshing to see a movie's heroine actually be innocent and convincingly genuine.

229,marian_chuang2004,Best high school chick flick ever!,10,29 November 2010,"Clueless is by far one of the cheeriest, cutest, and funniest romantic comedies I have ever seen *squeal!* Based on Jane Austen's story Emma, this rambunctious chick flick centers around Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone), a rich, spoiled high school popularity queen who concludes, after successfully setting up two teachers into romantic bliss to boost moods (and subsequently her GPA), that she is a born pro bono matchmaker, and sets off to meddle in everyone else's love affairs. When new girl Tai(RIP Brittany Murphy) arrives, she immediately gets her lotion-lathered nail-polished hands on her as her next project, and hilarity ensues. Unlike her British counterpart though, who's often been described by many as selfish and bossy, this modern-day shopaholic protagonist is justwellclueless, but endearingly so. She may be manipulative and high-handed, but she really does believe she is doing the best for everyone.Thanks to the script and Alicia's acting chops, there is no flighty blonde I adore more than Cher. The script sparkles with comedy and wit, and from her words you can tell that beneath her airhead appearance is actually a smart girl, albeit misguided. I know it's hard to imagine that she's both smart and dumb at the same time, but she pulls it off. The other characters are just as funny and adorable: Di with her insane fashion sense (bridesmaids in sailor suits, anyone?), and Tai, who frankly knows a lot more about love than Cher does, but isn't aware of it. Even her father is funny, and not in the nerdy wanna-be-hip manner that's been recycled in Hollywood a bajillion times, but as a fierce guy who doesn't take sh*t from others and encourages his daughter's scheming behavior. There's also great chemistry between Cher and her eventual love, and the happy romantic ending, which is a big plus, since I live my love life vicariously through movies *sighs* All in all, besides the fact that it leaves me craving for more, this movie is perfect!",Clueless

Alicia Silverstone plays a popular fashionable teenage girl. She is superb. Paul Rudd (The Object of my Affection) also does a great job with his character Josh. It is about a popular 16 year old girl named Cher, who helps people (e.g. she helps the new girl, Tai to become popular) to satisfy her own needs, which back fires on her. She ends up falling in love and changing her self image and personality for the best. This is a must see movie for all. An instant classic.",Clueless

It is a fun, light-hearted movie about the pressure to be 'cool' and shows you can be yourself without changing your appearance, or attitude. It is perfect for people who just want a bit of light comedy. It is one of the movies of the '90s and even though I was 2 in 1995, I fully enjoyed this movie (now!) It is about Cher, a slightly ditzy but very confident 15 year-old who enjoys shopping, partying and having fun. She travels through the start of her teenage life being mean and 'popular' but after a fight with a friend, she realises that isn't what life is about. Although the movie focuses on many aspects of her life, I think it is her personal growth that makes this movie so classic.",Clueless

While it is more of a movie for girls than for guys, it is must-see movie for those girls who haven't seen it as yet. Cher's voice and the way she acts is really cute. The driving part is very funny. Cher's hair looks precious. The part where she sat with Josh watching TV and put pins and clips into her hair and tied it up into a half-pony got some fame. Maybe because Alicia did it really well.

She's totally a Betty but how can you watch Clueless, arguably the best teen chick flick of all time, and all you could get from it was how attractive Cher was.Minor spoilers in this paragraph: The plot was good and I loved the monologue where she was like, ""I was just totally clueless!"" The only thing I didn't really like about the movie was how the aforementioned monologue was centred around Josh, and although I do love me some romance I would've preferred it to be on her personal development and growth but I think you can really see that in other parts of the movie so it isn't a huge issue.Also, obviously the outfits were iconic. Do I really have to elaborate? I mean even twenty five years after the release of the movies there's still girls dressing up as Cher in her yellow plaid blazer and skirt for Halloween. It has really cemented itself in both pop culture and fashion.Basically I'm just totally buggin over its criminally low score and reviews seemingly written by fourty year old men creepily lusting over Alicia Silverstone's (and I quote) ""smooth and lickable"" legs and reducing this movie to just eye candy.

263,annemiekestallaert,a great parody on Jane Austen's Emma,9,27 January 2008,"In the last 3 decades several interpretations of the fabulous Jane Austen's work have been made, the most well-known being Bridget Jones' Diary. This one, a contemporary exploration of ""Emma"", is however by far the best for succeeding in translating the 19th century social structures into the 1990's. Without adding extra morals or trying to create a new story it perfectly shows us social satire as ms. Austen would have loved to make it, if she had lived in our time. Without losing credibility, this film displays all the book's main characters in a logical contemporary context, adding a bit of humor and insight in our society. With great punchlines, I might add.Some will see this only as a high school comedy, and they ARE to be pitied. In that case this film isn't any better than most Hollywood products these days, and, however amusing, hardly making any lasting impression at all. It'll be just a nice way to pass a Sunday afternoon. Recommended by my nieces that's all I expected, but boy was I in for a nice surprise! A great movie giving you something to muse about afterwards. It's time I give my nieces my well-tattered copy of Emma to start with...I hope this movie will inspire a new generation into reading the classic books of ms Austen, and challenge other movie-makers to keep using classic themes as the base for many more great films.",Clueless

I was excited and looking forward to some high-quality comedy, along the lines of ""Austin Powers"" or ""Superstar"". I could not have been more disappointed if I had watched a Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen movie. At least the twins act their age. Let me just say this: If ""Clueless"" had been a 5-minute skit on ""Saturday Night Live"", it might have made it.

266,amoc910,I'm Clueless About Why This Film Was Made,1,12 August 2012,"So, what was this movie about? I mean, I just watched it, and I still don't know. I was TOLD that it was a rich snob who took a loser girl and turned her pretty and cool. Now, it was easy to tell where it would go, and end up, but I still thought it would be a nice waste of time. Boy was I wrong. Firstly, the acting was so terrible. It really made me feel ill. Every time the lead role opened her annoying lopsided mouth I wanted to go over to 1995, and shut her trap with duct tape. Everything she had to say was so 'every note in the scale'. Her voice went up and down in a way that made you want to rip her voice box out. Not to mention she was as stupid as all get out. How do you relate to a character who if you looked at her at the right moment you would probably catch drooling on the desk. The only good actors were Paul Rudd (as always) and the lead's dad, (for some reason. He barely had any lines, he was just the only other convincing role)The second thing was their god awful clothing. If you haven't seen this film, I literally cannot describe the clothing. Whether they look really rich or not, their clothing is just..... I don't know. It's like they're all dressed up for Halloween or something? It's truly mental! Then, there was the plasters. There are people with plastic surgery bandages on their faces everywhere. Eventually you think to yourself, 'Okay, I get that their in California, but not EVERYONE is as fake as the hideous main character!'And of course, we now come to the worst part. The plot. Or plots. Or, string of random events (if you can call them that) stuck together into an hour and a half composition of boredom. So, first she fixes this girl up, then she disappears, then she goes to a party where they all do drugs, then she gets sexually harassed, then held at gunpoint (something which she never notifies her dad or the police about for some bizarre reason which we aren't told) and then she goes to a disco, with a guy who turns out to be gay, then her ex-stepbrother starts to love her (SERIOUSLY, this ACTUALLY HAPPENS. I mean, if this were brought to court it would probably be listed of incest of SOME description, right? I mean, even if they aren't anymore, one would still 'always think of him as a brother' yeah? It's so.... creepy). Then her friends are all screaming because they drove onto a freeway (you're probably wondering 'why are they screaming?' I will ask myself that question every day until I die. WHY WERE THEY SCREAMING? THEY WERE DRIVING!) So then she can't believe she failed her driver's test, after crashing the car into another car... And then the girl from the beginning shows up, and she's popular, (oh, and we're expected to believe that this main character girl was popular too - even though she had... one.....two friends at the beginning of the movie!) and for some reason she thinks that this other girl doesn't deserve to be popular and she tries to drop herself into conversation by going all 'Well when I was held at gun point-' and being all offended when people ignore her. I'M SORRY LADY, YOU JUST SAT DOWN AND PEOPLE ARE LISTENING TO SOMEONE ELSE FOR JUST ONE SECOND! And then she thinks for some reason she needs to change the 'error of her ways' (?) and gives all her stuff to charity.... yet I still feel she's just as twisted, spoilt and arrogant as she was when the movie began. Mostly because she thinks that everyone would give their left arm to have HER of all people, to attend their lowly skateboard tournament. WHAT AN HONOUR QUEEN MAIN CHARACTER (I can't be bothered to hit the back button and learn her name)Then there's the whole thing about the entire cast is in their twenties and they're playing fifteen year olds (who act like anything BUT fifteen. I've never seen people my age look, dress or act ANYTHING LIKE THAT). And none of the characters were believable. They all seemed to develop a boring one dimensional character for the full movie (I say full, with so many random plot lines, most characters probably got 2 minutes collectively on screen.) But then suddenly they'd say or do something totally out of character, which was weird. Probably some failure of a technique they used to try and make everyone a little 'deep'er. And there was this thing (which I think may have been something they tried to make the 'special' kind of thing with the main character where she 'can argue her way out of anything' - though this talent isn't explored at all. I think she says something along the lines of it twice and then she talks about it as if it's her catchphrase. OH and of course, how could I forget? We get to see the 'fantastic' lead french her ex-stepbrother right at the end. Trust me, it's french. I could go on for so much longer about it's many travesties against the film community but I'm bored of thinking about it. Oh, and one last complaint. Are we really expected to believe people would go to the new girl for sex advice? She'd obviously never slept with anyone, I don't care what the movie said. Why did lead girl drag her around to so many guys if she wasn't a virgin? She can obviously do it herself!",Clueless

Rewatching it tonight, I've realized how much it's had an effect on me growing up and my sense of humor. While the film brands itself as dumb and superficial, the writing is so sharp with literally every joke landing. I could remember every single line of dialogue despite not having watched this movie in years. The comedy in this film, while being very 90's, is so incredibly timeless. The cast is great too. Alicia Silverstone as Cher Horowitz is exuberant and delivers everything great timing and bounce. The other characters (Stacey Dash as Dionne, Brittany Murphy as Tai, and others) are all perfectly cast. The fashion of this film is fun to look at. All the bright colors and fun patterns make everyone super stylish. These looks are still referenced by huge designers and artists even today. A lot of the film is very influential in so many spheres of pop culture, that alone makes this a must watch.The one thing that's still a little weird is Cher's love interest Josh (Paul Rudd) is her (ex) step brother, which will always be strange.

As Alicia Silverstone so brilliantly demonstrates, being the most glamorous and popular high school girl in Beverly Hills isn't easy.Cher is a beautiful, ultra-rich teenage girl who is envied, admired and loved by all her peers. Cher is your typical status- and style-obsessed modern girl who is less concerned about getting good grades than wearing the right outfit. Cher gives the audience an insight on the hearts and minds of today's pampered youth and proves that while she may be a spoiled princess of Beverly Hills, her heart lies in the right place and she has good intentions. The audience can expect to see various demonstrations of teens proving this stereotype wrong.Cher has many expectations to fulfill. Her father is a litigator so frightening that he gets paid $500 an hour just to argue with people. However, despite how fearsome he is in his career, he is a caring father. Cher refuses to take ""no"" for an answer in any aspect of her life and uses her inherited conniving, manipulative, charming personality to get what she wants. In the beginning of the movie, Cher comes off as a typical valley girl- spoiled, air-headed and totally unconcerned with anything that's not related to her.Cher has many expectations to fulfill.

She goes against the ""rich girl"" stereotype by helping her hopeless teachers find love. Although she originally sets her teachers up with the intentions of improving her own grades, after she sees how happy they are together, she realizes she has the opportunity to help others around her.When a hopeless new girl, Tai, transfers to her school, Cher and her best friend, Dionne, use their popularity for good rather than evil and take on the challenge of giving her a total makeover before introducing her to the Beverly Hills High School scene. Tai makes new friends, gets her heart broken, and eventually ends up with Travis, the boy she has been crushing on since day one.After Cher discovers Tai has become more popular than her, she recognizes how misguided she was and gains a greater perspective on what she wants in life. She changes her appearance in hopes to look older and her priorities by taking on responsibilities at school. She soon realizes that she is surrounded by good people and that each of her friends have a quality that makes them good and unique.

290,sonofashrub,Is Emma Clueless? Is it true to the original book?,6,6 April 2009,"Is Emma Clueless?(Or are they completely different)Clueless is a modernized movie version of the book Emma by Jane Austen. The two stories share much of the same plot, and characters, yet manages to be a completely different story. I believe that a lot of this can be is represented by one small difference; the difference in titles. Unlike, the other film versions of the book, Clueless does not share a title with it. I believe titles to hold large importance over the general meaning of whatever they have labeled, and the difference in title makes it quite obvious that the two works have different meanings. A book entitled ""Emma"" is clearly about Emma, whereas a movie entitled Clueless is clearly more about the main character's cluelessness than the main character herself.There are a few things that make this clear. The movie version is, first of all, in a more modern society, and most importantly, in a school environment. By being surrounded by professors, and other students, her cluelessness is much more exaggerated. The scenes where she is giving ""lectures"" to her peers really show this quite well, as most of the students laugh at her, the teacher clearly thinks she's an idiot, and that one rival girl looks like she wants to kill her. Her lack of driving ability, a skill that even the most average of people are expected to have, is clearly a nod towards her vapidness. Some characters, or at least their personalities, seem to be put in just to show how clueless she is. Her father, for instance, is an important lawyer; clearly quite competent and wildly different from Emma's father. His constant yelling for her to do better, (even in his misguided way) makes it clear that she isn't doing all that well, academically. Even the gay friend that she originally had a crush on had dressed better than she did, a skill she had always been the best at in the past. Cher's character is clearly developed to be a girl who has almost nothing except her beauty and good heart; her influence comes from others' love for her, and not from anything she's accomplished. Emma may not have been the most beautiful girl in the world, but at least she had some abilities in painting or on the piano, and her lack of knowledge was not nearly as apparent in a world where education wasn't standardized. Furthermore, Emma's weak and needy father make for many scenes that show off Emma's independence and use as a daughter. A final issue that can be raised on this topic is the goal of both stories. Obviously the titles of a story reflect a lot on the goals of the author, and it is not different for these two mediums. Clueless, unlike Emma, seems to be about the main character getting over her cluelessness. She realizes at the end of the movie, when she falls in love with her step-brother Josh, that she doesn't want to be liked only for her beauty. She starts watching the news and participating (and even organizing) in charity work in an attempt to better herself as a person, and to show people – especially Josh – that she's not just ""a ditz with a credit card."" Emma was not so much about Emma getting over her cluelessness, but about Emma herself, and all of the events related to her that transpire. Jane Austen never makes it clear that Emma needed to make herself over, and start doing charity work or any kind of studying to be a better person. Jane Austen did not make Emma a character who made mistakes because she was too dumb, she just made Emma a character who was too strong minded to see that she was making a mistake. Mr. Knightley's quote: ""Better to be without sense than to misapply it as you do,"" shows this pretty well. Emma is a book about Emma realizing her strong mindedness and changing out of her own will for fear of hurting further people. Mr. Knightley's marriage proposal happened to be a nice side effect, but nothing more. Clueless is a movie about Cher slowly coming to the realization that she has very little in the way of useful skills, and that if she were to ever impress Josh enough to like her, she had to wise up, or ""get a clue."" The two characters' motives were completely different, and therefore I think the stories were completely different.While it is true that both stories had very similar plot points, uneventful structure, and settings, the main characters, themselves, were fundamentally different in a few ways, as this essay has shown, and therefore shows that that is really all that they had in common. Their titles, which are both very fitting to the respective book or movie, show that they were about completely different people, with different motives, and personalities. Though both main characters were kind hearted and good natured, Emma had some form of underlying morality that guided her later self-discovery, while Cher had nothing more than her selfish desires to feel better about herself and impress a boy. If Josh had been unintelligent but instead wildly interested in lawn mowing, Cher would have just as easily dedicated her ""self-discovering moments"" towards learning new things about lawn mowing. Emma would have become the Emma at the end of the book knowing Mr. Knightley would not fall for her, and in fact did do just that.",Clueless
291,jimphsmith,"Of its time,",7,16 September 2009,"I first watched this movie in the late 90's and as a young teen it was like others have commented, light hearted stuff. This belongs to the age of preppy teen flicks like 10 things I hate about you and almost anything with Freddie Prince Jnr. When a pie was just for eating if you know what I mean:) As a movie it has a good flow. Excellent early roles from Alicia Silverstone, Paul Rudd and Donald Faison. All of whom have gone on to bigger and better things. I cannot help thinking this film led to Donald Faison being type cast as a goofy token black guy in series such as Scurbs and indeed the TV series spin off of the movie, but he acts well in most roles if only as a support not as a lead.The overall corny cliché feel to movie may lead some to take the film less seriously than it should be, but it succeeds in entertaining without the swearing or nudity, and in this genre thats worth applauding.",Clueless
292,bobdroid,"Poor acting, weak story.",1,22 August 2003,"I had seen the TV series of 'Clueless' before watching this movie, but  it didn't prepare me for how truly awful this movie was. At least the series was only 30 minutes long. Sitting through this movie was horrible. This is the only movie I remember where I have found nothing funny. Beyond that, there was no drama, no action, no real emotion whatsoever. The acting was poor at best, although there's not much anyone could do with a story like this. How such a horrible movie ever became a TV show is beyond me. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on something more entertaining.",Clueless
293,Charms434,"Good movie, that was a mirror of its era",7,29 January 2020,"So if you're reading this in between a bunch of 1 ratings. You're probably wondering just what's going on? Why is it so loved. The movie is basically a reflection of the young Gen X era (more importantly how it's perceived). people also missed the classic 80s teen films and this was a bit of a jump back to that.
Most of the 1 reviews are from people born 10 years later who NEED to tell you it's based on Emma (because they're smart and have google). They also have to show they're completely against commercialism in all its forms (and again knew before you that this film is based on a Jane Austin book).
They're not watching the film for what it is. It's not trying to be Citizen Cane. Simple movie dealing with being a teen (a very rich teen) in the 1990s. Easy.",Clueless

Finally people have a chance to understand that those who they consider 'shallow' are not, and are quite often, smarter than they are so the lesson? Dont hate! I really like the fact that it portrays so-called 'shallow' teens as having ideas, opinions and smarts, because we do! Just because we dress well and look good doesnt make us any less credible. I love the wardrobe for this movie, its timeless! Cher is the best character ever, and the rest of the cast are excellent!

Anyone that has a dumb friend, rich friend, fat friend, ugly friend, or simply a friend who is trying to find themselves needs to see clueless. Your first viewing will not be everlasting. The big deal is not the movie itself. The big deal is the laughs shared between friends before, during, and after the film. If you don't catch yourself saying (at least once) ""OH, As if"" then you haven't had the clueless experience. If I had a dime for every inside joke my best friend and I share from clueless I could probably pay all of Cher's tickets. If you want a pick me up for you and your friend pick up a copy of clueless. Between Josh's dashing good looks and keen intelect and Cher's oh so charming wit, you are bound to find something to make you want to shop again.",Clueless
296,layton09,Good Movie - Worth Seeing at Least Once,7,30 July 2013,"Clueless is a romantic comedy about a group of extremely wealthy teens in Beverly Hills. Cher's (Alicia Silverstone) life revolves around clothes, boys and basically just getting whatever she wants. She can talk her way into or out of anything. Cher and her best friend Dionne (Stacey Dash) decide to make the new girl, Tai (Brittany Murphy), their project and make her as popular as they are. Soon Cher realizes she is the one who actually needs a makeover; only she needs to makeover her soul. She emerges a more caring less clueless individual and finally has found herself that Baldwin she was looking for too.This movie is a great coming of age film about a girl finally realizing that there are more things to life than shopping. Throughout the movie we get to watch and laugh as Cher develops into a far less clueless being than she was, although still pretty clueless. She matures as a character just as the kids of The Breakfast Club do. She actually reminds me of a modern Claire. The story line of the movies while different definitely has some similarities as well. The characters all realize that who you hang out with and where you come from are not as important as the person inside. Cher as well as The Breakfast Club all come out of their experience more mature and with some new great friends.There is a scene where the camera zooms in on Cher as she is thinking of what everyone else does to contribute to the world. It gets in close so that you can her expression and that she truly wants to better herself. Then she says that she wants to help. She decides to head up the disaster relief campaign. I also think it shows a great enlightening moment for her when she is walking and she figures out that she loves Josh (Paul Rudd). All the lights from the fountain that light up behind her and then the music plays with the trumpets right before she looks into the camera. It really pulls you into the scene and makes you feel like it is a magical discovery that has hit her to her core. It changes her entire demeanor around him after this moment too. She gets fidgety and nervous. I think this scene is one of the turning points in Cher maturing as a character.I think this film was a great way to combine a coming of age film with a comedy instead of just a regular drama. You got to watch Cher grow as an individual and get some laughs on the way. I think this movie is an overall good viewing experience.",Clueless
297,AlwaysAllison,Clueless,10,21 February 2005,"I LOVED Clueless!! Alicia Silverstone was SO funny as Cher as well as the entire cast. The movie is SO funny and also has great romance scenes.

If you haven't seen it, rent it at blockbuster. If you haven't seen it in a while, rent it at blockbuster. If you've seen it a couple times, buy it! It's worth the money.

(discovering that the soundtrack CD also contained excellent covers of some all time favourites like Shake some action and All the Young Dudes, I settled on buying that) My attitude towards the film was shaped by the fact that all my grade 5/6 female students loved it so I assumed it was yet another case of great soundtrack, shame about the film! 10 years later I happened upon Clueless by accident when I got a subscription to cable movies and couldn't find anything else to watch!!

She was really ditsy and only spent money while men did ""real work"". Well I have big news, women in the 20th century generally do not act like this. I know that the movie was supposed to be based on ""Emma"" by Jane Austen, but I was hard pressed to find much resemblance. Why couldn't Cher have been a smart sassy young lady? I think that would have been a modern Emma. This title evidence of modern suppression of women.Also it was full of stereotypes and borderline racist insinuations. I would have liked to have heard a few of the girls plans for the future. I enjoyed the novel ""Emma"" as a historical piece of literature not as a representation of today's young women.",Clueless

There you can actually See a film with funny characters, and with a lot of sex, drugs and alcohol.

I like who they casted to play Cher's father (Dan Hedaya). It was a good choice in casting because you as the audience are a little frightened of him and the other characters are but Cher giggles every remark her father gives and manipulates it to get her own way. I also like that they made Cher come across as childlike and innocent but at the same time glamorous and popular. The film started a lot of actors career's like Britney Murphy and Breckin Meyer. There are some known actors in the film like Paul Rudd and Alicia Silverstone. I also like how they changed the classic novel into the modern culture nowadays, like making the character Frank/Christian gay in the film instead of interested in another girl instead of Emma.",Clueless
304,gloomanddoom,They really were clueless!,1,13 January 2007,"A friend of mine kept telling me ""You have to watch Clueless; It's just the best movie ever!"" So I watched it and, well, no offense to anyone who likes this movie, but it really sucked. The only good thing about it was that it had (a few) good-looking guys in it.Most movies actually have plots to them; ones that go up and down as the movies progress. This movie's plot just flat-lined the entire way through. If a movie's not gonna go anywhere then it should at least be funny. But somehow it can't even manage that! The funniest line was ""And my buns: they don't feel nothing' like steel"", and that's not very funny at all! Maybe I'm nit-picking here, but I cringed every time Cher (seriously, who would name their kid that?) said ""Haiteeans""; It's Haitians you moron! She was so annoying! By the time she was held up by the thief, I was rooting for him to shoot her! And what is with the computer program that picks out her clothes? Honestly, she can't get off her @ss and go look in the closet?! Exactly what kind of school allows you to walk through the door dressed like that anyway? Slut School? If any one of those girls stood on a street corner, they would definitely get picked up by the cops (if not some horny guy). And that hat that Dionne wore at the beginning; what was that, a plant pot?! If you want to watch a good teen movie, then I suggest Sixteen Candles or Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Of course if you're like my friend and you think that shopping, fashion, and popular people *cough*vain brats*cough, cough* are what make a good movie, then you might actually like Clueless.

This movie made fun of Cher and her friends, it wasn't glorifying them. The only character they made real was Josh (Mr. Knightly). This is not like the insipid BevHills9whatever that took itself too seriously.I loved this move and oh BTW, I'm a 58 year old woman who also loves Jane Austin.

310,rickydanger45,hey nice,10,11 July 2018,"The 1990s were certainly an interesting cultural moment. Hip-Hop and Grunge were some of the most dominant cultural forces in the world, Micheal Jackson had finished his race transition, and the OJ Simpson trial was raging on. I suppose that other, more important sociopolitical things were happening at the time, but all I care about is western pop culture and so should you.At the first glance, Clueless can seem like a double parody of both teen culture at the time and Jane Austen (who I hold out wrote what were effectively the original Hallmark movies). And it mostly is just that. Yet at the same time Clueless did something very interesting. While teen movies leading up the this relied on the trope of various cliques (Jocks, Nerds, Burnouts, Goths, Cheerleaders, etc...), Clueless both parodied and subverted those archetypes by humanizing them.While there were certainly scenes and jokes that played on those stereotypes (Travis asking if his kids would view Nine Inch Nails in the same way that he views the Rolling Stones, Murrays speech on the non-misogynistic use of ""woman""), Clueless managed to make these stereotypes feel less like the two-dimensional cutouts of films like Can't Buy Me Love and more like the actual people they were based upon.Another thing I really like about this movie is how crystal clear and sharp it all seems: from the camerawork to the dialogue, the movie has a clean, witty, and polished feel that actually really adds to the feel",Clueless
