0,MartinHafer,You probably shouldn't be watching this!,7,5 October 2021,"""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a film from Robert Rodriguez (director) and Quentin Tarantino (writer and star)....so you can safely assume it's NOT a family-friendly movie! In fact, compared to their other work, it's even more violent and inappropriate. So, I suggest you ask your mother permission before watching the film!I hated the first portion of the film, as it was ultraviolent and cruel. Folks are murdered right and left by the sadistic Gecko brothers (George Clooney and Tarantino). I hated this portion and seeing them lighting folks on fire and shooting others in the head at close range nearly made me turn off the film.Later, following this rampage, they kidnap a family in an RV and head to Mexico. There they stumble into a bar in the middle of nowhere (whose name IMDB probably won't let me write due to their standards). While at first it seems to be nothing other than a strip club filled with drunks, soon the folks there reveal themselves to be vampires....and about 30-45 minutes of non-stop carnage follows. Believe it or not, despite all the impalings, exploding heads and the like, this violence seemed silly, over-the-top and not at all realistic...which is why I much prefer this portion of the film. They weren't murdering people but evil monsters...and the special effects were so far over the top and silly that it really isn't that horrid to watch. However, be forewarned....this is a very adult movie in most every way. There are MANY, MANY politically incorrect and sexist things in the film...and once again, IMDB's standards probably make it impossible for me to list them here!! The film WILL offend many viewers.Don't show this to kids, Father O'Malley or your mother if they come to visit!!",From Dusk Till Dawn
1,Leofwine_draca,Rip-roaring blend of crime and horror worked for me,9,11 July 2016,"Quentin Tarantino's films have always been controversial, something which has given them cult appeal. Tarantino ups the violence level and goes one step further to give us this odd film, which blends the crime and horror genres seamlessly, smoothly flowing from one scene to another. All of the Tarantino trademarks are there - hip dialogue, cool stars, brutal action - which makes it a Tarantino film, even though the director is Robert Rodriguez. Rodriguez brings his own unique style to this film, giving it a glossy, shiny sheen and adding in features which associate it with the classic western film - even the classic bar room brawl is in there.Opinion is mainly divided about this film, but I love it. The action is fast, the gore is plentiful, and there is plenty of non-stop violence for horror and action fans alike, which make this film feel like a cross between THE EVIL DEAD, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and PULP FICTION. While the first half of the film is a typical crime story, focusing on the characters instead of the action, the second half is a surprise non-stop flow of action as the survivors take on the huge vampire hordes.The acting is all excellent in this film. Quentin Tarantino is well-cast as the creepy sex pervert who is mentally unhinged, his nervous stammering portrayal making him seem a harmless weed. George Clooney is the real star of the film, though, delivering smooth dialogue throughout while also being a commendably tough action guy in the second half, never breaking a sweat as he gets splattered with dust and slime. Harvey Keitel never fails to impress and he enjoys himself in an against-type role as a by-the-book preacher who has lost his faith, and his character acting is well suited to the film. Juliette Lewis plays her usual 'kooky' self, and she also acquits herself well in the action stakes, being the most believable character of the lot.The supporting cast is also impressive, thanks to the inclusion of two major cult stars. Firstly there's Tom Savini as Sex Machine, looking exactly like the guy he played in DAWN OF THE DEAD, a biker, who's smart and fast with his whip. It's great to see Savini back on screen, I can only lament about whatever happened to that VAMPIRATES film he was making. Another cult star is Fred Williamson as a typical tough no-nonsense wiseguy who just happened to be in 'Nam, and he has some of the best lines as he fights the vampires.Among the varied explosions and killings, bad language, and perversity, the special effects are also highly impressive, mixing together rubber and CGI in a pleasing, effective way. The vampires makeup may look more alien than bloodsucker, but it's strangely old-fashioned and scary looking. The many different vampire deaths are also brilliantly done with computers, from meltings to burnings to disintegrations and many more. There's even a magnificently animated giant rat creature in there among the blood and grue. Expect lots of extreme violence as people have their throats and arms ripped open and the vampires are brutally staked.FROM DUSK TILL DAWN has so much energy that it can't fail to entertain the viewer constantly, from beginning to end, and the influence on films like BLADE and VAMPIRES is clear. Obviously fans of subtler material may not find the excess to their liking, but there are many show-stopping moments (the sexy snake dance turned blood-fest is surely a moment of cinema history) and knowing references to other horror films (Peter Cushing is even mentioned) that fans will have a field day. Amazingly exciting!",From Dusk Till Dawn
2,SnoopyStyle,Rodriguez-Tarantino make a great team,8,6 October 2013,"Director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino make a great team. This marries the splatter fun of Rodriaguez with the delicious dialog from Tarantino.Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino) are bank robbers. Richard is a little insane and breaks Seth out of court. They take the Fuller family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu) hostage. Once in Mexico, they stop at the wild bar Titty Twister to wait for Carlos expected before dawn. Just when things couldn't get any crazier, Salma Hayek starts dancing.This is a well made simple gore fest. It doesn't let up until they reach sunlight. It's a film where Rodriguez has thrown everything into it. Tarantino actually works well as manic maniac. It's kind of his thing. Clooney brings his superiority to his character. He does need to be more menacing. That's probably the only minor complaint I have. Clooney seems out of place at times.",From Dusk Till Dawn
3,claudio_carvalho,One of My Favorite Cult Movies,9,12 October 2012,"After a bank heist in Abilene with several casualties, the bank robber Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his psychopath and rapist brother Richard Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) continue their crime spree in a convenience store in the middle of the desert while heading to Mexico with a hostage. They decide to stop for a while in a low-budget motel.Meanwhile the former minister Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) is traveling on vacation with his son Scott (Ernest Liu) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) in a RV. Jacob lost his faith after the death of his beloved wife in a car accident and quit his position of pastor of his community and stops for the night in the same motel Seth and Richard are lodged.When Seth sees the recreational vehicle, he abducts Jacob and his family to help his brother and him to cross the Mexico border, promising to release them on the next morning. They head to the truck drivers and bikers bar Titty Twister where Seth will meet with his partner Carlos in the dawn. When they are watching the dancer Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek), Seth and Richard fight with three bodyguards. But soon they discover that the bar is a coven of vampires and they need to fight until dawn to leave the place alive. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is definitely one of my favorite cult movies. I have just seen it again, now on Blu-ray, and the film is still entertaining. The plot is divided in two parts, the first one (and the better) with the violence of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the second part is funny, entwining horror with comedy. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Um Drink no Inferno"" (""One Drink in Hell"")",From Dusk Till Dawn
4,nogodnomasters,Peter Cushing does it all the time,10,1 May 2019,"Clooney, Keitel, Tarantino, vampires, and strippers. That in itself rates 5 stars. This is an excellent film which includes quirky characters, great dialouge, with memorable scenes and lines. A different type of Tarantino movie: no flashbacks. Clooney and Tarantino play criminal brothers. Tarantino is the psychotic of the two and Clooney has to deal with him, reminding me of a Steinbeck novel that has nothing to do with this film.Tarantino demonstrates he is as talented in front of the camera as he is behind. Of course if you are the type of person who doesn't like cheesy topless vampire strippers, then you have no need to watch this film.F-bomb, off screen rape, blood, gore, strip club nudity, naked feet.",From Dusk Till Dawn
5,classicsoncall,"""Okay ramblers, let's get ramblin'.""",7,20 April 2021,"If you go into this knowing it's a vampire flick, you'll wonder what the whole first half of the movie is all about, as it's seemingly about a pair of outlaw brothers who kidnap a family for the simple fact they own an RV, and they want to use it to make a getaway into Mexico. The pairing of George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as bad boy siblings doesn't seem like it would make sense on the face of it, but the guys make it work, with Seth (Clooney) having to cover for Richie's (Tarantino) indiscretions at every turn. Where the film loses any sense of composure comes right after Titty Twister bar dancer Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek) finishes her sultry and seductive number, and summarily turns into a vampire from hell. From there on, the picture rages into mindless gore and flailing body parts, aided by an assortment of weapons, with wooden stakes made from pool cues rendering a host of vampires immobile for the moment. The unfortunate hostage family, led by Harvey Keitel's ex-pastor character, engages in the rampant carnage with no other options immediately coming to mind. Rounding out the madness are appearances by Danny Trejo as bar proprietor Razor Charlie, Tom Savini as the awkwardly named Sex Machine, and Fred Williamson joining the action as a patron named Frost. Not to be outdone, Cheech Marin shows up as three different characters, and easy enough to spot each time. Not varying very far from your typical vampire script, the vile creatures who make it to the end of the story perish with the first hint of daylight burning their carcasses to ash. For those of you still wondering why my summary line by Clooney's character sounds so familiar, look no further than the Tarantino directed film ""Reservoir Dogs"", wherein the same line was uttered by Lawrence Tierney in the role of Joe Cabot. I guess it was so good it had to be used twice.",From Dusk Till Dawn
6,gavin6942,Rodriguez and Tarantino,7,8 June 2015,"Two criminals (Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney) and their hostages unknowingly seek temporary refuge in an establishment populated by vampires, with chaotic results.I believe this was the film that really cemented the Tarantino-Rodriguez connection. Tarantino writes and stars, with Rodriguez directing. Their combined influence is noticeable -- the dialogue is very much Tarantino, whereas the more Texan / Mexican influence is certainly Rodriguez (not to mention the casting of Danny Trejo).Aside from some cheesy special effects with the transformations, this is a pretty good horror-crime-action flick, and has rightly become something of a modern classic.",From Dusk Till Dawn
7,lee_eisenberg,From high quality till silliness.,4,17 January 2006,"George Clooney's acting career sure started off shaky. There was the ridiculous ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", the hokey ""One Fine Day"", the pathetic ""Batman and Robin"", and the predictable ""Peacemaker"". By early 1998, it seemed like his career was going nowhere, but then he starred in ""Out of Sight"" and proved that he could do good roles (continued with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", ""Ocean's Eleven"", and ""Syriana""). As for ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", it started out good but then got silly. Maybe it was fun (especially Cheech's ""pussy"" monologue, and the position of that gun), but otherwise nothing that we haven't seen. Salma Hayek was sexy though.",From Dusk Till Dawn
8,jboothmillard,From Dusk Till Dawn,7,31 October 2006,"From director Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, Sin City) and writers Quentin Tarantino and Robert Kurtzman (director of Wishmaster), this is a fantastic black comedy action horror. Basically brothers Seth (young looking George Clooney, during his success in ER) and Richard (Tarantino) are fugitive criminals have done a bank robbery. They kidnap the Fuller family, father Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and son Scott (Ernest Liu) to help them get across the border into Mexico. They have arranged to meet a kingpin (for a payoff) at a bar called the Titty Twister, and they have all night to drink and enjoy themselves. When a situation develops where they get their guns out and start shooting, this is when the exotic dancer Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek) is the first of many to suddenly turn into a vampire, which (even with the clue title you don't expect it to turn into a horror film, because of previous events). The few people that have got through the first bunch of the vampires, including Sex Machine (Tom Savini) and Frost (Fred Williamson) are using what they know to defend themselves from the approaching terror, including making crosses, stakes through the heart, holy water and guns. Also starring Cheech Marin as Border Guard/Chet Pussy/Carlos, Desperado's Danny Trejo as Razor Charlie and Kelly Preston as Newscaster Kelly Houge. The special effects and make-up is impressive, plenty of gory explosions of blood, guts and goo, and some humorous inventive Tarantino style moments, including a penis shaped gun (barrel and two side chambers in Sex Machine's crotch), a dead torso as a guitar, and of course, a very sexy dance by Hayek, which was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Very, very good!",From Dusk Till Dawn
9,ccthemovieman-1,Two Movies In One,7,27 March 2007,"This is unusual in that it is really two separate movies in one: the first half is a crime story and the second half is a vampire extravaganza. THE BAD NEWS - Harvey Keitel plays a Baptist minister who has ""lost his faith"" after this wife's death and intimates that those who have it are fools. In truth, he's just mad at God after what happened and he dos somewhat come back to his faith at the end. Of course, it takes a killer to preach to him at the end! Only in Hollywood do we have this kind of secular nonsense preached! The whole Keitel character is so theologically weak and ridiculous that it's past me getting upset over it. I just hope viewers aren't stupid enough to believe this kind of minister is normal (and acts and talks as like he does in this film.)Anyway, people watching this should also be aware that there is a lot of ""language,"" meaning tons of f-words said by about everyone. There is a lot of gore, too, in the vampire half of the film. So, if you expect all this or aren't offended by it, you are in for one wild ride because.....THE GOOD NEWS - Despite with very low morality of this movie, it is extremely entertaining and never, despite multiple viewings, gets dull although the violence gets to be a little much at the end. It would have been a better film had it been cut about 10-15 minutes. George Clooney, as the more stable of the two killers, ""Seth Gecko,"" is fascinating to hear. Although obnoxious, he is easily the the most fascinating character in a film filled with weirdos. It's one of the most interesting characters Clooney has ever played.This is stylishly filmed and humorous in parts. It has the Richard Rodriguez (""El Mariachi trilogy) look all over it: stylish, outrageous and cartoon-like at times. Actually, many of the characterizers here a pretty perverse, especially Clooney's brother and partner, ""Richard"" (Quentin Tarantino). What a sicko he is! At least Tarantinto played himself, making his role easier to play.The people at the bar in the second half of the film (featuring actors Danny Trejo, Tom Savin, Fred Williamson and Selma Hayak) have to be seen to be believed! You want to know who sleazy this can get? Just listen to Cheech Marin's ""pussy"" speech outside the bar. That about says it all.Finally, the music in here is very good, if you are a fan of the blues and especially the Vaughan brothers. This is one of those ""guilty pleasures"" I can never decide whether to own or not. I got rid of it, but wouldn't mind seeing it again.",From Dusk Till Dawn
10,Tweekums,A film of two halves,8,4 August 2016,"As the film opens a Texas Ranger pops into a liquor store and starts talking about a bank robbery in Abilene. The robbers, Seth and Richard Gecko, are believed to be heading through Texas to the Mexican border he has no idea that they are hiding in the store and he doesn't live to find out. The brother's continue south to a motel near the border. Here they meet the Fuller family; Jacob and his children Kate and Scott, for are taking a holiday in their recreational vehicle. Jacob is a preacher suffering a crisis of faith after the loss of his wife. The Geckos take them hostage and force Jacob to take them to a sleazy bar in northern Mexico.Here they settle down and have a few drinks while waiting for Seth's contact to arrive. While waiting they learn the terrible truth about the bar it is a nest of vampires who prey on their unfortunate clientele! If they are to survive until dawn they will have to recall everything they've heard about vampires and Jacob will have to find his faith again.This is very much a film of two halves; the first a tense hostage situation and the second a full on vampire movie there is nothing in the first half to suggest what is to come. George Clooney does a fine job playing against type as Seth and is ably supported by Quentin Tarantino who plays is disturbingly creepy brother. Harvey Keitel is more understated as Jacob Fuller, Juliette Lewis impresses as his daughter and Ernest Liu is pretty good as his son. Selma Hayek may not be on screen for long but she oozes sexiness in the film's most memorable scene. The style of action changes too; in the first half it is grittily realistic in a fairly mean way then in the second half it is more full on blood and gore done in a more tongue in cheek way; an example being the four stripper-vampires who end up staked on the legs of an upturned table. Overall I'd say that this is very much a cult movie that people will either really enjoy or really dislike thankfully I enjoyed it and would certainly recommend this to fans of the films of Robert Rodriguez or Tarantino.",From Dusk Till Dawn
11,BA_Harrison,Bloody good fun.,9,18 January 2010,"Two desperate criminals take a family hostage in order to escape to Mexico; once safely over the border, they head for sleazy strip-bar The Titty Twister, unaware that the establishment is home to a nest of vampires who feed upon the clientèle.Fans of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino certainly get their money's worth with From Dusk Till Dawn: not one, but two genres—gratuitously violent crime action followed by over-the-top horror; a smart script that contains just the right amount of cool, quotable, quick-fire dialogue (as opposed to the overlong boring monologues that QT can sometimes be guilty of); sexiness in the delightful forms of Juliette 'Jailbait' Lewis and Salma 'Salsa Hot' Hayek; fantastic splattery gore from effects gods KNB; and a superb cast that includes George Clooney (proving he can play 'bad'), the always dependable Harvey Keitel, plus cult movie legends John Saxon, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, Danny Trejo, and Cheech Marin.Still firing on all cylinders from his El Mariachi sequel hit Desperado, director Rodriguez ensures that From Dusk Till Dawn is an absolute blast from explosive start to blood-drenched finish, packing the film with wall-to-wall mayhem, stylish visuals, macabre comedic touches (watch for the hilarious bit where one vamp is killed on a pool table and his eyeballs roll into the corner pockets), and cool Tex Mex rock music. And although the story borrows heavily from other films at times—most notably, 80s teen horror Vamp—it matters not a jot: I'm sure you'll be having far too much fun to care!After all, who could fail to enjoy a film that features a biker named Sex Machine (who is armed with a spring-loaded crotch cannon), a sexy dance scene starring the gorgeous Hayek (who allows lucky old Tarantino to indulge in his foot fetish), Juliette Lewis requesting oral pleasure, George Clooney revving a pneumatic stake, Marin listing the wide variety of pussy available in The Titty Twister, and buckets and buckets of juicy, top-quality gore? Not me, that's for sure!8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",From Dusk Till Dawn
12,moonspinner55,Flashy and profane,6,16 September 2006,"Stylish, violent thriller concerning bank-robbing brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino!) who kidnap a preacher and his two kids in order to cross the U.S. border into Mexico; they eventually wind up at a biker bar full of vampires. The satirical edges in Tarantino's barbed screenplay continually make light of all the bloody carnage, and one wonders if we're supposed to laugh at the non-stop barrage of shootings, stabbings, gorings, and bodies on fire. Undeniably energetic, unsubtle, high-voltage stuff; it has a terrific cast including Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis, but it won't be to everyone's liking. Followed by a straight-to-tape sequel, which involved none of the talents here. **1/2 from ****",From Dusk Till Dawn
13,paul_haakonsen,Action-packed vampire flick...,7,29 December 2015,"I remember back in 1996 when this movie initially came out, I wasn't particularly thrilled. Why? Well, because of George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino on the cast list. But it is a vampire movie, so I still gave it a go.And now in 2015 I watched the movie for the fifth or sixth time since it was released. The movie was a slap in the face surprise first time around when I watched it, but it has gradually grown better and better.While the movie does start out slow, it quickly picks up pace as the story of the homicidal Gecko brothers unfold. On the run from the law, the outlaw brothers take a preacher and his family hostage as they make their way towards Mexico. At the Mexican rendezvous, a bar named The Titty Twister, things go from bad to worse as night falls, and blood-sucking vampires from Hell infest the seedy bar.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a wonderful mix of action, comedy and horror. A mix that director Robert Rodriguez managed to pull off quite nicely.The vampires in the movie were quite a treat. Why? Well, they were not the charming, romantic Gothic creatures as seen in many other vampire movies, nor were they sparkly teenage heartthrobs seen in later movies. No, they were bestial and animalistic savage creatures. And the special effects were good and right on the money.The cast in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was off the charts. While I didn't particularly Clooney and Tarantino in my younger years, I have learned to get past that. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are actually phenomenal in the movie. But the movie has a heap of other great talents on the cast list, including Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Tom Savini, Cheech Marin and Fred Williamson.This 1996 movie is a definite must watch movie, whether you like vampires or not, and it spawned two less impressive sequels and an awful TV series. But the 1996 movie that started it all is well-worth watching. And it can be watched over and over.",From Dusk Till Dawn
14,dbdumonteil,"the unlikely marriage of ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) and ""Evil Dead"" (1981)",7,18 March 2007,"Sourced from a story Quentin Tarantino penned in his youth and dusted off in the wake of the ""Pulp Fiction"" impact, this Robert Rodriguez effort achieves this incredible hybrid. I must say I am uneven about the two authors of these credentials. For Tarantino, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Kill Bill: Volume I and II"" (2003/2004) and at a pinch ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) but ""Pulp Fiction"" isn't in my straitjacket of the most memorable movies made in the nineties. As for Sam Raimi, the ""Evil Dead"" saga hasn't got a prominent place in my favorite horror movies but ""a Simple Plan"" (1998) and the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man gave me a positive side from him.I could have the same judgment about Rodriguez himself: I saw ""the Faculty"" (1999) when it was theatrically released and I forgot all about it. Ditto for ""Sin City"" (2005) which was visually a black splendor but I don't remember much about the story. On the positive side, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" entertained me until the last shot. It's cut in two distinct parts. The first one has more the look of a road-movie imbued with thriller with stunts, shootings, corpses galore and a dash of suspense. It's the part I favor the most. The second half of the film changes territory and takes a leap into the gore movie sourced from the eighties with blood, special effects to satisfy the genre. There is also a little of George A. Romero's masterwork ""the Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) and I do think this part is weaker than the first. The action becomes a bit sluggish and special effects are sometimes too intrusive. But perhaps, it was an inescapable rule to this kind of story.The amount is a film rooted in two different cinematographic genres and if it's a little hard to swallow, it means to jump on a genre while jettisoning the other, Rodriguez's effort has positive things in its contents to have a good time. Sequences are shot with care and shrewdness like the very first one. Like in ""Reservoir Dogs"", we won't properly see the bloody break-in but just verbal facts from the characters and the TV. It is also permitted to hail Tarantino for his sharp dialogs. My favorite lines are when George Clooney and Tarantino take Harvey Keitel and his son hostage and Juliette Lewis arrives in the room from the swimming pool:What's, um, going on? - We're having a bikini contest and you just won.Later in the van on the road that leads to Mexico:Where are you taking us? - Mexico - What's in Mexico? - Mexicans.Black humor shouldn't be neglected like the sequence when the journalist says the increasing number of killed people after the hold-up. And the actors seem to have fun as much as we do, notably Clooney and Tarantino in psychopathic killers who shoot first and ask themselves questions then.This B movie won't cater for all tastes for evident reasons but as it is painstakingly made as a whole, the alliance Rodriguez/Tarantino paid off well and it's a film to which I would return with pleasure.",From Dusk Till Dawn
15,Quinoa1984,Gore + vampires + Tarantino & Rodriquez= great entertainment,10,29 April 2000,"Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk till Dawn combines vicious violence, Cheech Marin vampires, and some funny humor from the cast into one big collective film.  More than a basic horror movie, it has Rodriquez as a fine director and Quentin Tarantino as a good screenwriter who bring to the screen basic shoot em up fun.  Not all of it is for the people out there, but for thrill seeking teens, it's worth a glance.The story involves 2 criminal brothers (George Clooney and Tarantino) who are part focused and part insane.  They kidnap a family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis) and bring them to a bar called the T**y twister while waiting for morning and their money prize.  But what ensues in that bar is terrific fun in which all the members are vampires and are relentless ""from dusk till dawn"".  Great fun, terrific violence (if not disgusting) and cool quotes bring this film to a fine T.  Look for Tom Savini as Sex Machine, Salma Hayek as a stripper and Cheech Marin who plays 3 characters.

16,wes-connors,Road Kill with Clooney and Tarantino,5,16 August 2009,"Texas thief George Clooney (as Seth Gecko) teams up with kinky, demented brother Quentin Tarantino (as Richard Gecko) for a serial killing blood-fest; then, the two high-tail it to Mexico. They are driven there by ex-minister hostage Harvey Keitel (as Jacob Fuller) and his underage children, Juliette Lewis (as Kate) and Ernest Liu (as Scott). Hard-drinking Mr. Clooney thinks Mr. Keitel and Mr. Liu are ""fags"" because Liu is Asian. Horny Mr. Tarantino imagines Ms. Lewis wants him to eat her. Eventually, the bonded quintet wind up in an orgy at the ""Titty Twister"", a vampire-infested Mexican nightclub conveniently ""Open Dusk Till Dawn""...This film makes a very uncomfortable change in direction; it should have either stuck to the serial-killing brothers, or introduced the ""undead"" theme earlier. It doesn't always hit the mark, but director Robert Rodriguez and writer/co-star Tarantino inject some humor into the story. The way TV newscaster Kelly Preston reports the serial brothers' body count is fine satire. And, Clooney is like Cary Grant on acid. Probably, the film's peak is a very effective opening, with John Hawkes and Michael Parks excellent as the ""World of Liquor"" store clerk and his Texas ranger customer.

17,BandSAboutMovies,Vampires ala Tarantino and Rodriguez,7,23 July 2019,"From Dusk Till Dawn came from the brains of Robert Kurtzman - the K in KNB - who wrote the original story, co-produced the film and helped create the special effects. It brings together Quentin Tarantino - who wrote the script and acts in the film - with Robert Rodriguez, the director of films such as Desperado, Sin City and, of course, the Planet Terror part of Grindhouse.Bank robbers Seth and Richie Gecko (George Clooney and Tarantino) hold up a small liquor store and end up killing the clerk (John Hawkes, Kenny Powers' brother on Eastbound and Down) and Texas Ranger Earl McGraw (Michael Parks, who despite this character dying, he came back to play the same role in Kill Bill Volume 1, a deleted scene in Machete and both Grindhouse movies).As they hide out in a motel, Richie can't help himself to killing and assaulting a bank clerk. As the cops get closer, the brothers take the Fuller family - Jacob, a former pastor and his children Scott and Kate (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis) - hostage. Using their RV, the brothers make it across the Mexico border where they contact will meet them and escort them to El Ray, a place where fugitives can find safety (this concept comes from Jim Thompson's novel, The Getaway, which also inspired two films - the 1972 Steve McQueen/Ali MacGraw classic and the 1994 Alec Baldwin/Kim Basinger not-so-classic).While hiding out at a biker bar called the Titty Twister, everyone in the place reveals themselves to be vampires - everyone from the announcer (Cheech Marin in one of the three roles he plays here) to the band (Tito & Tarantula), the bartender Razor Charlie (Danny Trejo) and the main attraction, Satanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek, playing a role named after the 1975 Mexican nunspoitation film where Satan selects Sister Maria to drag her fellow sisters into his domain).The Geckos and the Fuller family only have two other people who can help - a biker named Sex Machine (Tom Savini!) and Army vet Frost (Fred Williamson!). Of course, all hell breaks loose and barely anyone survives, but what did you expect? By the end of the film, the Titty Twister reveals what it was all along - an Aztec temple. That would be explored more in the two sequels and TV series that followed.Only in the world of Tarantino and Rodriguez can Tom Savini and Fred Williamson have just as much celebrity as George Clooney, who at times could truthfully lay claim to being the biggest movie star in the world. That said, they mean way more in my world. And throw in appearances by Marc Lawrence (Dream No Evil, Cataclysm) and John Saxon (probably my favorite actor of all time) and you have a movie that feels like it was made for my own personal enjoyment. Hell, before Clooney came on, Joe Pilato - Captain Rhodes from Day of the Dead - played Seth and footage exists of him in the role.While not as serious as the other Tarantino films we're writing about this week, From Dusk Till Dawn is a quick and fun bit of entertainment. And check out that Frazetta poster that was never used!",From Dusk Till Dawn
18,Coventry,Lots of bangs and lots of fangs!,8,11 December 2014,"It was only during my fifteenth – or so – viewing of ""From Dusk till Dawn"" that I realized that I've never written a user comment for this film. Now that's a quick win! Along with all the other movies Quentin Tarantino was ever involved in, I love every repeated viewing of this film and I say all the characters' lines simultaneously with them. Even now, nearly 20 years after its first release, it still qualifies as one of the most successful crossbreeds between action/thriller and my beloved horror genre, and the film still stands proud and solid thanks to the fast-paced script, the fabulous dialogs, the terrific acting performances and – of course – the excessive use of gore and bloodshed! ""From Dusk till Dawn"" starts out as a wild gangster/chase movie, with George Clooney (back when he was still desperately trying to get rid of his goody- two-shoes ""ER"" reputation) and QT himself as the violent and unhinged Gecko brothers on the run for State Troopers, Texas Rangers and all other various sorts of authorities. They hijack former preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his teenage daughter and adopted son, who're road-tripping in their motorhome in order to process the loss of their wife and mother. Hidden inside the motorhome Seth and Ritchie Gecko cross the Mexican border and immediately head towards an exclusive bar called the Titty Twister. The film then halfway transforms, totally unexpectedly and unpredictable (at least the first time), into an outrageous splatter flick as it turns out that the staff and regular customers of this particular bar turn out to be vampires feeding on passing truckers and bikers. This may sound stupid and far-fetched, but in Tarantino's script it works wonderfully well and the battle between fugitive gangsters and wicked bloodsuckers is spectacular as well as funny and even suspenseful. The film is chock-full of references towards classic horror films, and particularly vampire classics obviously, and stars a handful of nearly-forgotten genre icons in small supportive roles. There's a lovely little role for Blaxploitation hero Fred Williamson, as a tough vampire killer, and a (sadly too short) cameo appearance by John Saxon. Make-up genius Tom Savino clearly also terrifically enjoyed himself as a dressed in leather biker by the nickname Sex Machine. The direction is in the hands of Tarantino's equally gifted pal Robert Rodriguez, who also invited his buddies Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo and Salma Hayek. The latter's sensual dance on top of the bar tables, just prior to hell breaking loose, is definitely also one of the highlights of the film. ""From Dusk till Dawn"" is highly recommended entertainment that I'll undoubtedly watch countless times more. The sequels, on the other hand, suck like washed up vampire grannies.",From Dusk Till Dawn

20,hitchcockthelegend,Outrageous!,9,30 January 2010,"It was probably the most fun I had at the cinema back in 1996. I absolutely love ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", very much one of those films that you either buy into or you don't. There's no surprise element with the film, you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get - a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging ""B"" horror movie gore fest.The plot, for what's it's worth, sees two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) & Richie Gecko (Tarantino) on the lam after Richie breaks Seth out of prison. They are heading for the haven of Mexico with wads of cash garnered from a robbery. After overcoming a couple of fatal (for others) hiccups, the brothers, in need of a vehicle, kidnap faithless minister Jacob (Harvey Keitel), his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu). From here they must make it to a rendezvous point in Mexico - a bar called ""The Titty Twister"", where they will exchange cash with a friend of Seth's and start their new lives as Mexican civilians. Trouble is, is that ""The Titty Twister"" isn't no ordinary bar, it's a vampire stronghold and the Geko's - and their newly acquired captives, are on the menu. Can they make it till dawn and let the daylight be their saviour?.Swearing, blood, limbs severed, nudity, violence, sexual references, guns, more violence, more blood, other weapons, lots of teeth, bats, a snake, more violence. On it goes really, yet as Rodriguez and Tarantino start thrusting a blunt blade into your stomach, you really should be feeling them also caressing the funny bones in both your arms. For it's a key point that ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a damn funny film as well, something that bizarrely many critics have failed to understand. Honestly you can go to various sites and read people saying the characters are shallow, or the plot is preposterous!! Dear me, it staggers the mind. Hey don't like the film by all means, but failure to understand its genre leanings and homage persuasion is as funny as Cheech Marin is in the movie (one of many awesome ""B"" cult movie actors in the pic). It's bonkers and silly as hell, but once a fan of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", you are a fan for life. Well as long as you don't venture out to ""The Titty Twister"" yourself of course..Welcome To Slavery. 9/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
21,Theo Robertson,The Only Two Good Things In It Are Salma Hayek,4,26 February 2014,"When I get round to writing a history of Hollywood I will state that the most over rated film maker of the 1990's was Tarantino. He got lucky with RESERVOIR DOGS and the critics have loved him ever since. What the critics don't seem to notice is his failings as a screenwriter and FDTD best shows up these failings First up are the two main anti heroes. Are we supposed to empathise with them ? How ? They're a couple of cold blooded killers on the run who blow away a few people in a grocery store at the start of the film . And Tarantino rapes, murder and mutilates a hostage a few scenes later. Sorry but I'm not too keen on serial killers and sex offenders The dialogue sucks too . I suppose we could all nominate our own worst line from the film , mine's is : "" No thanks I already have a wife "" . I suppose it's stupid to point out that Clooney's character never mentioned he was married , and was only included because it sounded cool. On top of poor dialogue and unsympathetic characters we have the worst example of "" Mixed Genre Film "" . Most Hollywood movies are mixed genre to an extent but they don't start off as a violent crime thriller then mutate into a gory horror film. TITANIC is a love story cum disaster movie , TAXI DRIVER is an urban thriller cum redemption plot , APOCALYPSE NOW is a war film cum expressionistic horror movie. These films intertwine the genres, FDTD doesn't, it's just two genres tacked together , and tacked very badly at that. Robert Rodriguez does a good job at the directors helm , I doubt if he'll ever win an Oscar but he casts well . Without doubt the best piece of casting is Selma Hayek . Selma Hayek in a bikini , Selma Hayek in a bikini dancing on a table , Selma Hayek in a bikini dancing on a table in slow motion...... I'm all prepared for slavery",From Dusk Till Dawn
22,Scarecrow-88,From Dusk Till Dawn,8,1 August 2009,"I realize that Quentin Tarantino is a polarizing figure who has both admirers and critics because his films usually feature extreme acts of behavior that test a viewer's threshold and tolerance for cinematic violence and excess. His characters have dialogue that is often outrageous, explicitly vulgar, and even cartoonish. There's a quality in FROM DUSK TILL DAWN where it feels less like a naturalistic landscape and more of a trip into some ultra-violent, profane, frighteningly subversive place, directed with style and lack of restraint where QT and director Robert Rodriguez(..whose previous films, particularly DESPERADO, show just why he was born to form a partnership with Tarantino), throw caution to the wind, whipping up a gratuitous brew of machismo, visceral shocks, and over-the-top dialogue clashes. There's plenty of wicked, audacious humor, and you can just sense the perverted joy and child-like enthusiasm as you watch the film..this was definitely a labour of love for Rodriguez and QT.The cast is a phenomenon for a buff like me, particularly seeing Tom Savini battling it out with vampire Danny Trejo, Fred Williamson pulling a heart from the chest of a massive bloodsucker, and Harvey Kietel standing off a drove of ugly fiends using a baseball bat and shotgun in the image of crucifix. A deliriously nifty gag shows how ""equipped"" Savini really is where it counts! Also, seeing The Hammer get his cigar lit by a table dancing mamacita is also quite a highlight. Tarantino's homicidal Richard Gecko is a truly repellent character(..he's a seriously warped sex offender whose ""deficiencies"" drive him to kill those women he's drawn to)with a fixation for feet. The ultimate showstopper has the jaw-droppingly sexy Salma Hayek, as dancer Santanico Pandemonium, moving her audience into silence with quite a smoldering number. Clooney gets many chances to round off QT's constant supply of attitude-laden, very aggressive dialogue, his forceful presence ably fulfilling the role of an antagonistic criminal, who isn't afraid to use his gun, but would rather just succeed in his goal to reach a safe haven.The movie's a tale of two halves..before and after our cast of characters drive into the Mexican Titty Twister bar. Fugitive brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko(George Clooney and QT)are on the lam, heading for Mexico, blazing a violent trail through Texas, where their ticket to safety, as law enforcement and FBI are out to get them, lie in the RV of a former minister, Jacob(Keitel)and his children, Kate and Scott(Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu). Getting across the border, preparing for a rendezvous with an associate, The Bros Gecko think their troubles are over. The meeting location is the Mexican strip club, for truck drivers and bikers, the Titty Twister. What they don't expect is that the club is actually a front for a coven of vampires who use the place as a method of luring their meals! So Seth, once his bro becomes a neck feast for a bloodsucker, must forge an alliance with Jacob and his kids in order to somehow survive their dead-serious crisis...getting some assistance from others, such as ""Sex Machine""(Savini)and Frost(Williamson)who are able to outlast the first assault against the vampires. The opening half displays Seth's difficult trials with his unpredictable brother who seems unable to control himself. The vampire battles are heaven for gore aficionados, as bodies are ripped limb-from-limb along with plenty of effective uses of stakes driven through vampires in gruesome, unusual ways. KNB supplies the magnificent make-up effects. Some of the computer generated work is a bit noticeable, but I was satisfied with their work. Cheech Marin is a hoot in three roles, Kelly Preston has a cameo as a reporter, and the great John Saxon gets to stop by as a cop threatening to catch the Geckos.",From Dusk Till Dawn
23,LeonLouisRicci,Film Geeks Working Out,7,22 February 2013,"It's interesting to see these young Film maverick's at work. Shot, Cut, and Directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino. In this early effort you can see many a thing that will become trademarks. But one must say this is far from either one's best.It is like a workout, flexing the muscles and developing the chops. There are some glorious bits here and there is enough to satisfy Film Geeks and the lovers of Drive-In/Grindhouse Flicks because that is where this colorful, violent, trashy, thing comes from.Like most Rodriquez stuff you have to bring a strong stomach and be ready for some outrageous goings-on. There is a perverted gory atmosphere and some darkly funny Tarantino dialog and the make-up and SFX are quite good.This was Clooney's big screen debut and he doesn't disappoint.

24,poolandrews,Very entertaining action packed horror film.,8,25 March 2008,"From Dusk Till Dawn starts with two wanted criminals on the run, brothers Seth (George Clooney) & Richard Gecko (Quentin Taratino) are wanted for murder & robbery. They hatch a plan to cross the border into Mexico & kidnap a preacher named Jacob (Hervey Keitel) & his two kids Kate (Juliette Lewis) & Scott (Ernest Liu) to help them, hiding in the back of Jacob's large motor-home they manage to get across the border to the relative safety of Mexico. Seth has arranged a meeting with Mexican crime-boss to pay him off to let them stay at criminal hideaway El Rey, the meeting is set to take place at the Titty Twister bar which is actually frequented by blood sucking Vampires...Edited, co-produced & directed by Robert Rodriguez this action come Vampire flick is a bit of a gem that I have seen several times since it first came out & enjoy it each & every time. The script was by star Quentine Taratino who had just had bags of commercial & critical success (hell, he even won an Oscar for the screenplay) with Pulp Fiction (1994) & he followed that up with From Dusk Till Dawn which is a terrific Vampire horror film with a touch of heist flick about it. As has already been mentioned by the whole world & it's brother From Dusk Till Dawn can be split straight down the middle, the first half being a crime film with the Gecko brothers on the run from the law & during this half there is absolutely no indication that the second half of the film will explode into a full blown exploitation Vampire horror flick. Personally I think the sudden shift in tone, structure & even genre is a masterstroke & keeps the film unpredictable & it just feels totally & utterly right. There's plenty of action & gore, there's plenty of one-liners & amusing dialogue & it moves along like a rocket so it's never boring. Most of the character's are very good although I don't like how Tarantino made the Gecko brothers so unlikable, as the stars I would have thought they should be likable & not setting fire to innocent connivance store clerks which is the first meaningful thing we see them do.Director Rodriguez does a good job here with plenty of action & gore. It's clear both Rodriguez & Tarantino are exploitation fans & From Dusk Till Dawn is stuffed full of homages & nods to a style of film-making long gone. In fact the name of the film itself is taken from the signs found on drive-ins which showed this type of film. These signs indicate the length of the shows, which ran ""from dusk till dawn"". There's a fair amount of violence & gore although nothing too graphic since it needed to get an 'R' rating, there's slit throats, decapitated heads, ripped out hearts, blood spurting, lots of severed limbs, exploding & melting Vampires, chucks bitten out of flesh, holes in hands & other assorted bodily mutilations. The film has a nice style & looks very nice as well. The special effects are generally good although the CGI computer effects look a bit dated now, having said that most of the effects are of the on set rubber & fake blood variety.With a supposed budget of about $20,000,000 this is very well made with high production values. As well as being stuffed with exploitation homages in the script there are several cast members who will be recognizable to any horror film fan including Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Harvey Keitel, John Saxon in a disappointingly little cameo, Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo & Salma Hayek also gets a small role. The acting is pretty good & the best thing thing Clooney has ever done.From Dusk Till Dawn is a really fun action horror film that has a large plot twist about halfway through which I thought worked great. Followed by two straight-to-video sequels From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money (1999) & From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (2000) which were both poor & killed a potential franchise before it even started.",From Dusk Till Dawn
25,Bunuel1976,"FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (Robert Rodriguez, 1996) **1/2",6,22 October 2006,"This is another film I'd been wanting to watch ever since it was released. As some of you may know, I'm not much of a devotee of Quentin Tarantino - even less so Robert Rodriguez - and my main interest in it was to see how they approached the horror genre. I wasn't all that surprised to find that it's much more of a Tarantino/Rodriguez hybrid of cool dialogue, excessive violence, foul language and slam-bang action than an out-and-out vampire film! Anyway, the first half (which is the non-horror part, incidentally) is the best with George Clooney and Tarantino himself (still a worthless actor and mean as mush) on the run after a heist and kidnapping Harvey Keitel's preacher and family on their way to Mexico. When we finally get to the vampires, it's like the film-makers didn't quite know what to make of them and wanted to get it over with - as we only see a succession of humans getting bitten and transformed into the undead themselves, until dawn arrives and the vampires left standing are destroyed by sunlight.Tarantino gets to wear monster make-up and an embarrassed-looking Harvey Keitel dabbles in gung-ho action heroics - but this section does feature a delightful double-act in fx master Tom Savini (playing a character called ""Sex Machine"" and decked-out with a cannon device in his pants placed on top of his crotch!) and former 'Blaxpoitation' star Fred Williamson. For the record, Clooney is likable as ever, Juliette Lewis does her typically confused yet aroused teenager, while Salma Hayek is a sultry snake dancer billed as ""Santanico {sic} Pandemonium"" (but her appearance is much shorter than I had anticipated, given the prominence she is given in stills I had seen from the film!).",From Dusk Till Dawn

28,Boba_Fett1138,Probably one of the most awesome movies ever made.,10,13 August 2007,"In my opinion there are only 3 movies in the world that are really underrated/misunderstood; ""Mars Attacks!"", ""Starship Troopers"" and this movie. It makes me mad and sad when any of those movies gets flamed for all the wrong reasons.Yes, this movie is pulp, just the way as it was intended to. Robert Rodriguez is just a big movie-nut who also happens to make movies himself. He makes movies obviously for the fun of it, where profits and budgets don't seem to be his biggest priority. He just makes the movies he wants to and enjoys doing, they way he wants to. He's of course not the only director in the business that does this but he perhaps is the only director that also has the right connections while doing so. It makes Rodriguez unique in its sort and also one of the best and most enjoyable directors in the business. Amazing how many famous and respected actors actually agreed to appear in this movie. Guess it truly helps when you're friends with Quentin Tarantino and his name gets attached to the project as well. Would Harvey Keitel or Juliette Lewis else would really ever do a movie like this? Also a really gutsy move to case George Clooney in the most tough and carrying role of the movie. He still had his 'be good' ""ER"" image all written over him at the time. It wasn't until after this movie that he really got token serious as an actor and got cast in big production movies such as ""Batman & Robin"", ""The Peacemaker"" and ""Three Kings"". The story is totally original, in its own twisting and weird way. The first part of the movie the movie seems like a crime movie in which two brothers are on the run. However from the moment the character enter the Titty Twister bar in Mexico it turns 360 degrees, spins 3 more time and makes a barrel-role. That's how it best can be described. The movie becomes an extremely gory and ridicules vampire-flick, in which all the gloves are off. This movie is basically the ultimate dream for every B-movie type of horror lover. Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are obviously also two of them. They really didn't needed to make this movie, Quentin Tarantino had some big and respectable successes with ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", prior to this movie and Robert Rodriguez just had his big breakthrough with ""Desperado"". They just made this movie because they could and they really wanted to.The movie does have some great tough characters and the script has some good dialog in it, with some great humor as well. Not necessarily the typical sort of Tarantino sort of dialog but great nevertheless, in a different kind of way. He obviously had fun writing this movie, by putting in as many crazy and gory elements in it as possible. But the movie is still of course mostly a Rodriguez movie, made in his typical 'Mexican' sort of style, that is consistent with his earlier movies ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"".The movie is kept deliberately simple and silly. It enhances the fun incredibly and this might very well be also one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. It's delicious pulp, without any intentions. It's made purely to entertain and on top of the that, it's first class made, with people such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez involved and it has a great respectable cast in it, with persons that above all are very well cast into their roles. Most of them also seem to be in this movie just for the fun of it, which really shows on the screen. It helps to make the movie work and make it all the more entertaining to watch. Actors such as Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin of course also show up as always is the case in a Robert Rodriguez and the Salma Hayek cameo role is already sort of a classic and while leave the fan-boys drooling.The movie does not have the greatest special-effects or make-up, though the small details of the movie are done really good, but this is sort of usual for Robert Rodriguez movies and fits in with the rest of his movies and style. You can tell that they did their very best to make every sequences as gory as possible. It's however done in such an over-the-top and clearly intentional way that the gore becomes one of the humorous aspects of the movie. It's some very graphic stuff, so clearly this movie is not just for everyone.A totally awesome movie!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",From Dusk Till Dawn
29,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,90 minutes of pure fun,7,10 June 2008,"As others have said, this is a movie of two halves. Quentin's and Robert's. There's no doubt about which they are. From the very beginning of them both. The shift between is immediately recognizable as well. I doubt even a little effort was made on anyone's part to cover any of this up. Why should they? They aren't kidding anyone, nor attempting to do so. This is clearly, from start to finish, meant to be enjoyable, and guess what? It is. Whether that makes it their weakest piece is up for debate... I personally don't believe so. It's no secret that Rodriguez does his best work when the writing is done for him... just take Sin City... and he actually emulates Tarantino's directorial style well, keeping his own, highly energetic and cartoon-inspired, under wraps save for his portion. Aforementioned, however, is a more skillful script author(and herein, actually a pretty decent actor). So with them each filling the respective role they fit better, we're set for solid entertainment. And they certainly deliver. So do the effects crew. The music never leaves anything to be desired. The action is awesome. There is quite a bit of blood, gore and violence in this. Straight, single males also have plenty to look at. Clooney is bad-ass, with credit to QT for putting the words in his mouth, literally. The acting varies, but it's never downright poor. Savini isn't bad. The humor is twisted. The tone is cheesy. The pacing is about spot-on. The plot remains interesting throughout. Characters are relatively developed, certainly sufficiently. If you'll allow me to briefly digress... those viewing this and subsequently wanting a similar gaming experience, I would advise against going for the licensed release, of 2001... I did only play the demo, but I was rather underwhelmed. I instead suggest Vampire Slayer, the free and legally so modification for Half-Life, as it is very obviously inspired by this. Turning my attention back to the film... go for this, those who are into Quentin Tarantino's dialog and story-lines, and/or Robert Rodriguez' action and visuals. There's a DVD of this available with featurettes, music videos, the full-length documentary Full Tilt Boogie and alternate footage. There is also an informative commentary with the two who came together to make this, and it's definitely worth a listen if you like this. I recommend this flick to any fans of the people who helped create it, the ones who belong in one or more of the aforementioned groups in particular. 7/10",From Dusk Till Dawn

That is to say that this film is not for the squeamish. It is clever and energetic with a third act that takes the film in an entirely new direction that plays like the lost reel of another film. Quentin Tarantino breaks George Clooney out of jail and they head for Mexico. Along the way they take a former minister and his two children hostage in their R.V. Once there they stop at a bar that is apparently crawling with vampires. This is where the tone changes and director Robert Rodriguez brings energy and depravity to something that starts out like his Desperado but concludes like Dracula's last rite. Clooney does well as a criminal bent on accomplishing the task with little casualty, but will have to survive an evening more frightening than any crime job. Tarantino overplays his psychotic brother who kills with little recollection until fatality kicks in at the bar. Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis succeed as hostages although only one is lucky enough to walk out alive. Cheech Marin makes an appearance as a nightclub owner giving a monologue on female private parts. It is a clever attempt to cross two sub genres into one storyline.

The fact that there's an abundance of gore here certainly helps matters, due to this one's impressive portrayal of vampires in a rather imposing light as being far more interested in spilling blood and killing than in anything else, so the deaths they inflict as well as the retaliation to take them down are suitably gory and contain a ton of bloodshed. With two massive massacres in here, the main showdown in the bar-room where they reveal their true selves and just go crazy on the victims in the room as well as the last-stand where they're trying to fight the creatures off, contain a lot of big action, great deaths and lots of bloodshed. Also making them something to be feared is the fact that the special-effects make-up for them looks incredible, from the demonic look of most of them with the fangs and deformed appearance as well as the snake-like look of the main dancer makes for a great all-around look and makes their bloodlust all the more believable. It is also hard not to notice the featured striptease in here before the main massacre, it's about as sensual and erotic without crossing into sleaze as it's going to get and is definitely a highlight in its own right. The main problem here, though, is the beginning before they get to the joint, which consists of nothing but an endless stream of profanity and not much else, making the film appear as far removed from a horror film as possible and not really delivering anything remotely entertaining due to the personalities of the people we're supposed to be rooting for.

If you want to be entertained, watch this one for the fun of it.  This film is not for the serious at heart.",From Dusk Till Dawn
37,christopher-underwood,it can become a little waring,7,21 October 2017,"The script is good, the direction spot on and the performances from Harvey Keitel, George Clooney, even Quentin Tarantino and particularly Juliette Lewis, are excellent. Its just that however tight and exciting the first part is and however daring and innovative and special those special effects are, things could do with a little trim towards the end. I can imagine how excited everybody involved was at the chance to create every sort of vampiric being and then have them die in all the ways we have ever seen and then some. But, it can become a little waring, there is such a thing as overkill and for the viewer, who is not drunk or drugged, there is just too much. It is a shame because not only is the first half so good but the whole idea of the biker bar, strippers and vampires also good, even if a little reminiscent of Vamp, featuring Grace Jones as the mistress of ceremonies. So, all good but just a little too much even if it does all glow and glisten so wonderfully on Blu-ray.",From Dusk Till Dawn
38,Smells_Like_Cheese,Now that's what I call a bar fight!,7,15 September 2007,"I remember seeing clips a few years back on From Dusk Till Dawn, just of Selma Hayek turning into a monster, so obviously I knew I missed out on a bunch of information so I skipped out on the movie. But I know it's mentioned quite a bit because of the Quentin Tarantino fans out there, so when I came across the film in Hollywood Video, I didn't hesitate. Also not to mention that we have a few stars in the film besides Quentin, we have George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, and Juliette Lewis. So I just watched the film and while I think the story had a complete turn around, we went from a hostage/robbers story to a vampire horror story. It happened so quickly that I was a bit out of it after the film, but at the same time I really enjoyed the action. It was unbelievable, I'm not just talking about the vampires alone, I'm just saying how the family knew automatically to use weapons. Well, there are a few things, but I'll explain in a minute.Seth and Richie are two brothers who are robbers and killers, they are on the run to Mexico. They kidnap a family with their motor home van and cross the border. There Seth wants to meet a friend that can get him started with the money that him and his brother robbed from a bank, they decide to meet at the local strip club that is open from dusk till dawn. There Seth, Richie, the family end up getting something a bit out of their league and what they expected, vampires, and they're hungry for some blood.The acting is alright, enough to get by as believable, I mean, don't get me wrong, the cast was awesome, but it was a bit of a question to me on the roles they took on. While the story is very cool and creative, like I said, it turns so quickly into something else and they also leave with questions. This wasn't Quentin's best work, but I liked this movie better than Jackie Brown. I would recommend this movie for horror fans, because I know every Quentin Tarantino fan has already seen this film. But it's a cool movie, just I know that it could have either ended better or answered a few more questions.7/10",From Dusk Till Dawn

The story is lame, the screen play boring nonsense, and the film is a redundant mess until the un-dead meet up with the really un-dead and battle it out in a major Vampire vs Human bloodbath.

40,MovieAddict2016,"Bizarrely entertaining - loud, trashy, vulgar...fun. Not great, though.",7,9 January 2005,"Coming into this I knew it would be action over content - after all it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. The fact that the script was written by Tarantino didn't really mean anything since I had gathered from various sources that this was Tarantino's homage to the ""splatstick"" genre (of Evil Dead, etc.) and as a result the script probably wasn't so hot compared to Pulp Fiction.For the most part this is true. The first half of the movie IS really good in terms of cleverness and Tarantino-style stuff - good dialogue, interesting plot and unlikeable characters...unique. The second half, after they cross the border into Mexico - as others here have pointed out - becomes the Evil Dead segment of the film, where everything turns into some over-the-top, bizarre, gross-out vampire blood-'n-guts movie with bad special effects and cheesy scenes. (Albeit fun ones.) Some have complained that the transformation from seriousness to sudden vampire comic book content is too fast and the story would have been far more interesting had it been rooted in realism for its entire duration. Yes, and no. Rodriguez set out to make an homage to the spaghetti western/Evil Dead genre and did so. Tarantino's script is just the baseline for it all. It's like a bunch of friends got together and decided to make a movie - albeit friends with fairly good reputations as filmmakers. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Tarantino - not a bad cast! Had this been presented as an epic crime movie Tarantino would have helmed it. However due to the fact that he provided Rodriguez with the script and even performed a commentary track on the film's DVD release (something he does on none of his own directed films) just goes to show that Tarantino wasn't in it for the praise - he was in it for the fun and experience. Ditto for everyone else.And in that regard this is a pretty fun movie. Like Rodriguez' DESPERADO, it's a guilty pleasure for viewers and cast - a bunch of highly esteemed actors get together and have a blast.So no, this is not a great movie. The second half could be replaced with a more serious half and I think it would probably be one of the best thrillers ever if this was done. (Just imagine how great it could have been if it had been brought to a poetically justified ending with some sort of Gecko Brothers/law enforcement shootout a la Butch Cassidy/Bonnie and Clyde.) However I understand that's not what Rodriguez and crew set out to do with this movie - they just wanted to make an entertaining cult popcorn blockbuster flick.And they succeeded. It's entertaining and hip and stylish. Recommended.",From Dusk Till Dawn
41,Red-Barracuda,The ultimate in crime-splatter-vampire-road-movies,8,15 July 2010,"An unusual mix of crime-thriller and splatter horror, From Dusk Till Dawn is, if nothing else, a very entertaining film. It's unashamedly trashy with no pretence otherwise. But it's good quality trash none-the-less. The first half of the story sees a couple of evil brothers on the run from the law, while terrorizing anyone they meet on the way. They take a family hostage and cross the border into Mexico in their camper-van. When they arrive at their destination, unexpected things start to happen.For me, the crime-thriller part of the story is the most effective. It's tense and unsettling. George Clooney is very good as the chief brother, while Tarantino is OK as his unhinged sibling. In any case, their road trip from hell is compelling and really sets the film in motion. Once they arrive at their destination the film more or less starts over again, with all that went before effectively irrelevant as the movie turns into a vampire splatter flick. From Dusk Till Dawn truly is an example of two completely different film ideas joined together somewhat loosely. But it doesn't really matter as the result is definitely different, and it never takes itself very seriously. Watch out too for a very nice final shot that gives a whole new perspective to the 'bar' where all the undead action has taken place. And as for Salma Hayek, well, words fail me.",From Dusk Till Dawn
42,sddavis63,This Is One Crazy Movie,3,4 July 2011,"Extremely violent, very bloody, often crude and at times humorous. That about sums this movie up - except that you'd have to add to the list that it's really quite bizarre as well. The first half or so - while violent and bloody - comes across as pretty straight. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play bank robber brothers who are trying to escape from the United States into Mexico after pulling off a job. Much violence ensues, until the brothers finally take an entire family hostage (played by Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) and manage to get across the border into Mexico in the family's RV and then proceed with their hostages to an out of the way bar to meet up with their Mexican contact. This, of course, is where things turn truly weird.It turns out the everyone who works at the bar (the bartenders, the band, the strippers, etc.) are actually vampires - and quite bloodthirsty ones at that. What started as just a place to hang out until they meet up with their contact Carlos becomes an all night bloodbath as they do battle against these creatures and struggle to stay alive. The first half was actually pretty good, but for me the second half ruined it. This might have worked well as just the story of a couple of violent and perhaps insane bank robbers who try to escape from the law. The vampire thing (even though that's how the movie is sold) was completely overdone and to me at least became very tiresome after a while. How many times do we have to watch a vampire getting a stake through the heart or burned with holy water? Well, according to this movie, we have to watch it a lot! Although I usually like vampire themed movies this one was just too weird to really be of much appeal to me, although it might appeal to action-oriented teens.I will add a word about George Clooney. I generally don't care much for his movies. It's seemed to me that the bigger he's become in Hollywood the less passion he's putting into his work, most of which I would say is characterized by a total lack of energy or enthusiasm. This was different. I liked him in this role - perhaps because this was still while he was a TV star trying to become a movie star, he put more into it. Whatever it was, this may have been the best performance I've seen him give in a movie. Unfortunately, it had to happen in a movie I didn't care much for. (3/10)",From Dusk Till Dawn
43,thesar-2,The Original Grindhouse Double Feature,9,3 October 2010,"Remember when vampires were scary? Remember when they portrayed as the beasts they really are?Though I hate the Twilight series, despite the laughs it gives me, I admit, I love the TV series: True Blood, with its romantic and adventurous with a bit of humor take on the vampire lore.That said, it's refreshing to watch how vampires are supposed to be shown. And that's only half the battle! There's two complete movies in here (three, if you count the excellent documentary: Full Tilt Boogie based on the making of From Dusk Till Dawn) and both are wonderful to watch. You have the heavy Tarantino-laced opening half about two despicable bank robber brothers Seth (Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) who literally destroy lives in the path to Mexico and the second half – a completely different movie using the same characters who now find themselves deep within a Vampire Haven at the Titty Twister bar.It helps I love both Clooney and Tarantino, but I'm also very fond of the multitude of other actors: Michael Parks, Tom Savini, John Saxon, Hayek, Marin, Trejo and Keitel. And everyone was on their game throughout. In addition, the music and score rocked, the dialogue was absolutely spot-on and the tongue-in-cheek & no scene taking itself serious were awesome. If you like Tarantino's other films, or Clooney – you really have to like him, you will love this excellent film. Even Lewis, whom I've despised since Cape Fear didn't ruin my fun.I've now seen this at least a dozen times, each time I thoroughly enjoy it more. Director Rodriguez seemingly did the impossible and made it work 100%: he not only put way too much in the movie, he also turned these two ruthless murderers into characters you (gasp) rooted for. Generally, I don't like the overcrowding of films, but Screenplay Writer Tarantino made it seem just like a very long and event-packed day.(Very) Basic rundown: Seth escapes prison (well, courthouse) with the help of his brother and (severe) sex-offender, Richard, and the plow through many innocents to get money from a bank and attempt to get across the border. (Side Note: Even with the hilarious Marin playing his first of three characters, the border patrol agent, this scene would probably be impossible to take seriously in today's time.)One method to get into Mexico and hide out, is to kidnap a ""Lost Faith"" Minister (Keitel) and his two children who are riding in their new mobile home. (The dialogue between Keitel and Clooney from the moment they meet to the end is reminiscent of Ocean's Eleven's Clooney and Pitt's banter. In other words: a whole lotta fun.)They do make south of the border and to a strip club/dive, the Titty Twister, and dominate Seth commands respect while making the kidnapped family drink and converse with him. Okay, he does get the respect he desires until, well, uh, practically everyone turns into a vampire and it's up to a select few to combat and survive from Dusk till Dawn.It's a fun experience, especially if you're into Tarantino films – there was a lot of Reservoir Dogs here, after all.

The movie looks to be two separate movies of Tarentino's, one good action flick and one bad vampire movie stuck together because he couldn't finish either one.

As such, it's difficult to take seriously as an example of either movie (though I don't think 'serious' was ever one of its concerns). The worst thing is that, for how much I appreciate unique and (marketing and fame aside) surprising stories that aren't afraid to break conventions and be generally 'weird', its first half is honestly much better than its second, talking time to build proper characters and having them interact in unexpected ways that make sense within its established yet still somewhat heightened world. I'm not saying the vampire slaying isn't entertaining; the tangible effects and hammy genre winks do make for some enjoyable sequences. It's just that the ending almost feels like it's tacked on from another piece (without any real foreshadowing, even) and it reduces the movie's overall impact almost to the point that the finale feels like it might be better off watched in isolation.

46,bowmanblue,A grisly classic - not to be missed,9,27 January 2015,"There are few people nowadays who don't know From Dusk Till Dawn's 'twist.' Originally, it was two separate screenplays - one about bank robbers fleeing the authorities and the other about a standoff against vampires. Quentin Tarrantino decided to combine the two and package it as one film. The result: awesome.Although not directed by Tarrantino (instead, he casts himself in a leading role), it has a totally Tarrantino feel. Two bank robbers abduct a family in an attempt to escape the law and flee over the border into Mexico. Unfortunately, they run into a whole bar-load of vampires and are forced to team up in order to survive the night.Yes, it may sound like many similar films, but for a start it has an impressive cast, featuring a (young and unusually nasty) George Clooney, Tarrantino himself as Clooney's creepy, psychotic younger brother, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and plenty of cameos from other famous faces as either vampires of those destined to drive a stake through their hearts.Expect slow-building, rambling dialogue, not to mention the inevitable foul language and violence.If you like either Tarrantino's films or general action/horror, mixed with healthy doses of black comedy, then you really should watch this.And, guys, if you haven't seen Salma Hayek's 'snakedance,' you really haven't lived.

47,bowmanblue,So wrong (and yet so right!),9,17 July 2018,"There are some films that, in principal, shouldn't work and yet everything comes together in a 'perfect storm' of memorable film-making. 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one such example. Okay, so back in 1996 Quentin Tarantino was well within his rise to fame and everything he seemed to touch was well-received, so perhaps it's no surprise at how well this film did. Or rather this FILMS (plural!) did. Basically, it started off as two of his scripts that got fused together to become one, making it - almost literally - a film of two halves.I would say that there are 'spoilers' ahead, but, if you've watched the trailer, the big 'reveal' was shown for all to see. Basically, you have one half of the film is about bank robbers, the Gecko brothers, played by George Clooney and Tarantino himself. They're on the run and take a family hostage (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and a boy you've probably never heard of!) in order to get across the border to Mexico. What you have here is a crime/road movie... until they get across the border and are awaiting in a bar to meet their criminal contacts in their new home country. Here, things get a little crazy and the genre totally changes when they find themselves under siege from a seemingly never-ending army of vampires.There's much to love about this film, whether you enjoy one excellent performance after the next (who says Tarantino can't act?! Although it is worth noting that he only writes and stars in this - he hands over the directorial work to Robert Rodrigez), the crazy and deliciously over-the-top gory effects of the vampires being despatched in one creative way after the next, or the banter and classic Tarantino dialogue (and for the real fan-boys - such as myself - there are plenty of in-jokes, nods to other works and reoccurring actors playing different characters). In fact, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is so enjoyable it's quite hard to find a flaw in it... assuming you like your films cheesy with a healthy dose of self-knowing and black humour. Don't take it seriously. It makes sure it never does. Oh, and probably best to warn people not to bother with the sequels and the belated TV show is just an extended remake. Stick to the original (and best, obviously).",From Dusk Till Dawn
48,g-bodyl,A Tale of 2 Genres!,9,27 November 2013,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a masterful tale that mixes and matches up two successful genres very well: the hardcore crime drama and fantasy horror. The first half of the film incorporates some hard-boiled crime drama and some Taratino-influenced dialog. The second half, however more generic, is still a joy to watch especially with all the vampire action. So what I'm trying to say is that this film is an awesome ""B"" movie and is a fun, action-packed adventure.Robert Rodriguez's film is about two notorious brothers, the Gecko Brothers who kidnap a former priest and his two kids to escape across the border. While at a bar in Mexico, they come to realize that this bar holds house to extreme evil so they must gang up to defeat these creatures of Satan.The acting is pretty good and juicy. George Clooney shows in his first film role what a charismatic actor he is. Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis are pretty good in their roles as well. Even though I don't see Taratino as an actor, he gives a juicy and raw performance as the younger Gecko Brother.Overall, this film is an example of a pure ""B"" film. This film provides all the giddy fun you come to expect. The vampire designs are actually quite terrifying and semi-realistic. This is one of those films that successfully mixes two genres and escapes unscathed. I had a fun time with this film and I liked the balance of crime, horror, and drama.

54,851222,Superb,10,2 May 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.Imagine my surprise when nearly 20 years ago i was 11 years old and got a VHS copy (a highly good quality at the moment) of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". George Clooney was just a new and nice screen presents at the time and the many horror action flick were in the future. At the time i didn't know what was the true genre of this movie, thought it was going to be a nice thriller.For the most 50 min. it was actually a very well made thriller, with some hostages and a very likable main hero (or antagonist) and very basic plot line. But then, suddenly everything changed. At running time i think 55 min (didn't saw this movie in many many years now so sorry for inaccuracy) suddenly this thriller changed his genre in a moment, like probably no other flick till this date (02/05/2015) has ever did. From a heist thriller this became a monster movie, with NO earlier hints on that. NO hints. This is a rare as it can be. Tarantino? No. Yes and no. Even he prepares audience for a ride in a first minutes whatever wild roads it might take them. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was a different kind of beast. Gory, bloody, over the top, and bloody entertaining.Overall, if you haven't saw this flick, you probably won't be surprised of suddenly change in it's narrative during the ride because it's surely was spoiled many time already. Nevertheless, you should DEFINITELY see this flick as it delivers goods. All in or nothing - this flick delivers.",From Dusk Till Dawn
55,The-Sarkologist,A slasher flick in the style of grindhouse,8,29 October 2011,"My first piece of advise is do not watch this movie off television but either see it at a cinema (if it is being shown there) or hire it on video. (I don't know if cable cuts this movie to ribbons, but the free to air TV stations do). Basically, much of the movie is cut, and even though it is only the 'f' word, it is still annoying, and in fact it destroys one of the jokes, the one where Cheech Marin is going on about pussy.Anyway, this is a Tarantino movie (and in fact he acts in it, playing is real psycho) and it is divided into two parts. The first is a road movie where two crims, Seth and Richard, are attempting to escape the cops and kidnap a minister and his family. The second part is a blood fest in a pub called the Titty Twister, where they fight hordes of vampires, and most of them are killed.Basically, this movie is a cross between a b-grade horror and a road movie done Tarrantino style, which means it comes out very good. As we can expect in a Tarrantino movie, we have well developed characters and an excess of violence, designed not to desensitise but rather to shock. One scene is where we see, in flashes, the results of Richard's psychosis.Now Richard is an interesting character as he is truly psychotic, and Tarantino plays him really well. He seems to be a nice, gentle man, until we see him rip apart the hostage (which, fortunately, we are spared from watching), which Seth is outwardly a brutal man, but is an intelligent, clear thinking, individual on the inside. I guess this movie deals with duality, in the way that on the outside we are one thing while on the inside we are completely different. We have seen two, and Jacob Fuller is another, a minister of God on the outside while an atheist on the inside, but then it could be the other way around as he keeps on speaking his disbelief but when it comes down to it, he does truly believe. Kate Fuller is similar, on the outside seeming to be a sweet and innocent girl, not ready to face the outside, but is one of the two who survive. Then we have the vampires, who on the outside pose as beautiful women, but turn into horrid monstrosities that seek to kill all.I also love the clever wit in the movie. Unfortunately it is difficult to recite the gags because they are all partly visual (especially the best ones). I guess one needs a weird sense of humor and an iron stomach to handle this movie, but as one person once said, From Dusk til Dawn is the best vampire movie he had ever seen.",From Dusk Till Dawn

It is the perfect balance; Tarantino, who was best known for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction at the time, begins the film with his crime fuelled tale of two lowlifes getting up to crime-driven no good before Rodriguez takes over to create an explosive finale which brings about an element of the guilty pleasure as violence, entertainment and convention round things off.Like most films penned by Tarantino, From Dusk Till Dawn begins in a road side location-come-diner (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Natural Born Killers) and sees a perfect balance of terror, suspense, dry humour and that wonderful dialogue Tarantino is able to come up with when a local trooper delivers a story to a store owner about how he had a recent case of food poisoning. The immediacy of the two would-be lead characters is a jolt to the audience, foreshadowing the 'jolt' Tarantino will give us later on when he introduces elements of the uncanny at the strip club. But the terror of the hostage situation, the dry exchange between the store worker and one of the leads and the consequent exiting of the store as it goes up in flames is a one sequence example of the sort of cocktail Tarantino can fabricate in his screenplays, all demonstrated in the opening scene.The two leads are the Gecko brothers, Seth and Ritchie played by George Clooney and Tarantino himself, respectively whom are both on the run from American law enforcers following a bank robbery and a blood bath of an escape. This is something the trooper establishes happened, thus implanting a dangerous image of the brothers whilst they're off screen. What transpires is a brief journey through the desert, an incident with a hostage and then an acquiring of a motor-home thus enabling the brothers to get across the border camouflaged. When they do cross the border, it is the signal for the film to change gears and begin to mutate into something else but not without wonderful touches as applied by both writer and director.Initially, my eye is drawn to the casting and the twisting of the rules that entails, echoing the twisting of the genre the film will undergo at the strip club. Prior to From Dusk Till Dawn, Julliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel had played characters in Tarantino penned scripts; only they played Mallory Knox, the psychotic and deeply disturbed serial killer in Natural Born Killers while Kietel played Mr White and Winston Wolf in two separate Tarantino films. Their characters in this project are far more muted than in those films, with Kietel not even dropping an f-bomb despite being teed up to do so. On the contrary, Clooney is cast as Seth Gecko, a loose and rather aggressively criminal who will kill and maim without much second-thought and this goes against the role he was best known for at the time, that being as a character in the rather reserved TV series 'ER'.The scenes involving Gloria (Hillhouse), a hostage the Gecko's have taken, act as scenes prolonging both Tarantino's style as a writer and an establishing of character traits. The exchange between Gloria and Seth is brilliantly slick in its delivery and pacing whilst maintaining a distinct tone of menace that the film wants the brothers to continue to have. It also goes a long way to prolonging the trait Ritchie carries to do with sexually driven desires of malice towards women when he does what he does to Gloria and this in turn plants a seed in the audience's mind. So by the time the brothers have apprehended the Fuller family and Juliette Lewis' character has entered a room in a swimming costume, the audience is fearing the worst. Additionally, the actress that plays Gloria was Tarantino's acting coach and he's quite clearly, perhaps disturbingly so, cast her as the hapless female who has what happens to her, happen to her as a direct result of Tarantino's character.The Fuller family are indeed made up of Kate, Jacob (Kietel) and Scott (Liu); the latter of which wears a visual clue on his shirt in 'Assault On Presinct 13' as to the 'last stand' scenario the film will adopt later on. When everyone arrives at the Titty Twister club, Jacob says a prayer in the form of 'out of the pond and into the fire', again foreshadowing that entering this establishment is a big deal to the film and doesn't just act as a waiting spot. But the uncanniest of incidences follows Chet's (Marin) 'pussy' monologue at the end of which he leans over into the camera and, rather eerily so, utters an obscenity directly at us as we look up at him from ground level. It's a bizarre occurrence and for the film to suddenly break the fourth wall creates an uncanny sensation that all is perhaps not quite right with this place. Unfortunately, the tactic might be lost on most viewers due to the absurdity, and possible hilarity, of the preceding monologue.Once in the strip club, the film cools off for a while and becomes something entirely different, but something still thoroughly entertaining. There is a rather random five minute or so dance from Selma Hayek's 'Santanico Pandemonium', during which Tarantino gets to indulge in his 'fondness' for feet, a scene that he wrote for himself to partake in. Regardless, From Dusk Till Dawn remains a favourite of mine; on a film-making level and certainly on a guilty, more entertainment driven level.",From Dusk Till Dawn

However, I enjoyed a lot this movie, which I consider to be his most interesting work, being quite funny to watch(In a twisted, disturbing way)from beginning to end.It works perfectly well as ""Tarantinesque"" crime-thriller film, but it also is very effective as a deranged vampire flick.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" has all the excess and craziness that any viewer could expect from a film directed by Robert Rodríguez, but is also a highly entertaining experience, having lots of awesome and funny moments throughout the whole movie. The special effects and the music were excellent. Also, Salma Hayek was unbelievably hot here... What more could anyone ask for? Personally, I think that ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was Robert Rodriguez's masterpiece. I enjoyed it more than his ""Sin City"" adaptation and ""Machete"". And of course it was much better than his awful ""Spy Kids"" movies.",From Dusk Till Dawn

That says 2 things, I'm not a fan of the rest of his filmography (some stuff is ok) and I really like what he did in DTD.A fantastic pairing of Tarantino and Rodriguez that create the most electrifying road/vampire movie of all time (admittedly its a small sample pool!). Near Dark being the only other one that might qualify that I can think of.The action is good, its funny and sexy and this particular 'road' has plenty of blind turns to keep you interested.Fantastic Fun?",From Dusk Till Dawn
64,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"One Part Tarantino, One Part Rodriguez, All Parts Crazy",7,23 January 2012,"When you look at body of work of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, nothing could incorporate those styles more poetically and literally than ""From Dustk Till Dawn."" It could well be argued that their styles are mashed together like peanut butter and jelly rather than blended, the result is something fun and memorable nonetheless.The first half of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" serves up a crime drama with Tarantino's signature chaotic edge along and spurts of intense violence. Without any context, it's another wonderfully tension-ratcheted Tarantino film. Then our main characters go to check out the Titty Twister bar and strip club and suddenly we're handed gory over-the-top grindhouse mayhem.The only through-lines in the film are the characters. Performances from George Clooney and Harvey Keitel in particular make for a terrific overall film experience. Movies this screwy don't usually have the pleasure of such commanding talents, but ""Dusk"" has them and flaunts them. What we'd do 15 years later for Clooney to play a character like Seth Gekko again ...Gekko and his brother Richie are two thieves on the run. After blowing up a roadside convenience store, they run into father (Keitel) and his two kids at a Texas motel and decide to force them at gunpoint to take them over the border. Seth is smart and cocky whereas his brother clearly has some kind of mental disability in addition to being a sexual deviant. Throw all that out the window, however, when the entire lot of them are attacked by vampires.Keitel's Jacob Fuller is a God-fearing man who puts family first and the Gekkos and later vampires test that in different ways. Characters this likable never find their way into films like ""Dusk,"" but Tarantino characters have their own category. We empathize completely with Jacob's desire to keep his kids safe above all else.The creativity of the obscene B-movie side of ""Dusk"" (should I call it ""Dawn""?) makes Act II something worthy of enjoying all on its own. The makeup and visual effects work together in such a way that they form caricatures of vampires. We tend to laugh at the corniness of monster makeup, but the crew here has a self-awareness. They make ""Dusk"" freaky and hilarious all at the same time, never allowing the audience to dismiss it as total shlock.It's clear that as much as Tarantino and Rodriguez love these kinds of movies, they're not merely imitating the genre. They're giving it the quality of ingredients that only excellent filmmakers can provide. The only things holding it back are the grindhouse genre's inherent weaknesses and general confusion over why the first part of the film ultimately has nothing to do with the second. Those who like both filmmakers' styles will find ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" quite satisfying in all its imperfection.~Steven CThanks for reading!

65,videorama-759-859391,"Vampires QT style, makes you wanna have it no other way",8,4 January 2014,"From Dusk Till Dawn is another QT event or treat. Half a Natural Born Killers film, the remaining half, a vampire one. And don't think for a second, either, cause it's a QT product, it doesn't work as a vampire film. You're sorely mistaken. In my opinion, it's actually better that a lot of other vampire films, in terms of gore, makeup, and in the ways the vampires are put to rest, and how the remaining score of players, deal with fending them off, amongst some great QT tongue and cheek dialogue, he must of had a ball, writing this. It has a great start too, in a convenience store, before it's turned upside down by the Gecko brothers, in a shootout, before it's torched. Clooney is cool, charismatic and deadly, while Quentin, the sex offending sicko, does a fine job, indeed. We really fear these guys at first, where in the second half, we're rooting for em' to kill off the vampirish evil. Keitel turns in a much different performance, as a preacher, who's lost his faith. He's impressively good. Him and he's two kids Juliette Lewis, good, and his adopted Asian son, Ernest Liu, of obvious amateur ilk, are kidnapped and are used by the Gecko's as their ticket across the border. The first half of the film is rather nasty, one scene especially involving QT who's raped and killed a 50's female hostage, while Clooney goes out and some Big Kahuna burgers. Clooney also has a talent and charm, to be comedic. He really has his moments. Then comes the next half, where they make a giant mistake indeed at their rendezvous point, The Titty Twister, a truckers and bikers bar, offering lap dancers by hotties, Mexican food, alcoholic beverages, also a rocking band, plus a deadly vampirish secret of course. The gore and fight scenes are choreographed second to none, you feel the helplessness amongst this bloody mayhem, which is full on at first, aided by ghoulish and loud music scores. Perfect. Tom Savini as Sex Machine always comes prepared, with his waist ammo, that comes in handy for snatching beers of other rough folk. And Williamson (the Hammer) even looks big as a vampire, and one ugly son of a bi..h to go with it. Cheech Marin shows us what character acting is too, in three roles in which is bloody good. In one role as the dj host, outside the twitty twister, he informs us of the large inventory of pu..y that the Titty Twister provides, before getting hammered by Clooney too. I didn't realize either how good Danny (Machete) Trejo (a real life prisoner at one stage) was as an actor, who plays a bartender who gets into a little bit of a feud with Clooney, over the particular clientele of the Titty Twister. What we get here folks is one hell of a ride, and we do not wanna get off. I liked too how the Geckos came together with the Fullers, as friends, at the TT, before hell is unleashed, where earlier, the family would of truly been killed, if crossing them. QT, is one smart and lucky son of a b..ch who gets to suck Salma Hayek's toes. She's hotter in this, then Desperado, and she really can act too. One scene that was in bad taste, but was guilty amusement, was earlier with Kelly Preston as a news reporter, is giving out the tally of victims killed, at the hands of the Gecko, but saying it with a vim and excitement. But let's not forget, this is from the pen of Tarantino. FDTD, a different, less Tarantino hit, cinematically, stands apart from his others, but definitely put this one on your QT bucket, if not viewed it. It's vitally imperative, you do.",From Dusk Till Dawn
66,taylorkingston,An awesome movie...,10,26 April 2015,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. It was my first R-Rated movie (Australian ratings) and I didn't even realize until it was over. That made me sad that I didn't really relish my first 18+ movie, but oh well. It wasn't my last. I watched this movie when I was about fourteen, and it is very rude. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone under the age of sixteen. My parents weren't bad for letting me watch it, I didn't really care. The main reason I say sixteen and over is because if you're younger than that, you're not going to understand the very unsubtle references to sex and violence. This is a great movie and I'm still waiting for it to come out on Bluray. Come on, they bring Gone With The Wind on Bluray before this? What a joke. This movie does feel like two completely different movies. The first half is just a normal action movie and then the second half is blood and guts and vampires. This movie is about two brothers, Richie and Seth. After they rob a bank in Texas they are on the run. They do lots of cool stuff, such as blowing up a liquor store. And then some not cool stuff, like killing their very nice hostage. A family shows up at the motel, the one where Richie killed the hostage and they decide to kidnap them. They force the family, inducing a Dad, a son and a daughter, to drive them across the boarder to Mexico. Once they get there, they make them go to a bar called The Titty Twister, lovely name by the way, where Seth is supposed to handle some business. But then the sun goes down and all the bartenders and strippers start eating everyone because they're freaking vampires! Who would see that coming? I didn't. Everyone has to work together so they don't become dinner. Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.",From Dusk Till Dawn

68,GOWBTW,Great combination in this movie!,10,9 December 2005,"Another Quentin Tarantino hit is here. This is dealing with the world of Vampires. What is it? ""From Dusk till Dawn"". You got two dangerously deadly brothers on the run from law enforcement officers. Seth and Richard Gecko(George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) are cold and cunning, they killed and kidnap these guys are making a run. When Seth loses it when his brother Richard rapes and kills the teacher they kidnapped. That makes Seth mad at him all right, he would probably kill his brother as well. So they ditch that nice Mercury for a RV containing a widower(Harvey Kitel) and kids(Juliette Lewis,Ernest Liu). I don't know what goes on in the mind of Richard but Seth keeps his cool at all times. When the group goes South of the Border, it's an all-night truck stop. Giving to the term tourist trap. It's a trap all right. When this tavern is owned by blood-sucking vampires, there was no time for these people to scurry. The killers knew what they were up against. So the family help the killers and the other tourists rid themselves of these pests, sadly some of them fell victim to the blood-suckers. Cheech Marin had a lot of roles in this movie, and the pyramid was indeed surprising to see along with the trashed rigs at the bottom.

They stop at a motel on their way to Mexico, and kidnap a reverend Jacob(Harvey Keitel), his daughter, Kate(Juliette Lewis), and adopted son Scott. The family RV is used for their planned escape to Mexico. The sick mind of Tarantino writes a fantasy sequence where he gets dirty talk requesting oral sex from Kate; what a perv, the man is deeply disturbed. Along the way they make the big mistake of stopping at a club which houses vampires. A dancer appears on stage, dressed in a bikini and carrying a snake. It is Santanico(Salma Hayek smolders) and she dances as chaos breaks out. It's bloody vampire time and we get an overdose of flying body parts.

The violence is so over-the-top that it floats above the offensively objectionable and lodges firmly into the ludicrously entertaining. The film starts slowly: it takes the Geckos 45 minutes shoot up a liquor store, grab their hostages, and cross the border, but once they are unsafely ensconced in the ""Titty Twister"", the action sequences (preposterous even by fantasy-bloodbath standards) are nonstop and sanguinely amusing. The cast, which includes Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Cheech Marin (in multiple roles), and Danny Trejo is great, as is Robert Rodriguez's direction, and the script (by Tarantino) is profane and comical. The plot's a sieve and there are endless inconsistencies in the vampire life (death?) cycle, but this is not a story-driven film by any stretch of the imagination, so who cares. The closing shot is priceless. Definitely not for the squeamish, the fragile, or the easily offended.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Other more recent vampire films like Blade and Vampires are great but From Dusk Till Dawn is by far the best.  George Clooney is cool in his role as a play-it-by-the-rules bank robber and Quentin Tarantino is totally wicked as his psychotic younger brother.  From Dusk Till Dawn is also in my opinion probably one of the more original vampire films out there.  The idea of vampires in Mexico is completely original.  Viewers be warned however, From Dusk Till Dawn is incredibly violent, there is a lot of cursing, and Cheech Marin makes a barrage of funny one-liners that all include a certain female body part. Anyway, to sum it up, From Dusk Till Dawn is an original film, with an original plot, and some great casting and Salma Hayek ain't bad to look at either. 10/10",From Dusk Till Dawn

73,drqshadow-reviews,Forefather to Grindhouse and Stepchild to Natural Born Killers,6,24 August 2011,"The way I see it, there are two distinct ways to see this movie. One could bemoan it for robbing them of a full Tarantino movie, delivered in his prime, by saddling the plot with an unexpected swerve into Robert Rodriguez exploitation. Or they could sit back and enjoy it for the utterly unpredictable, bewildering, guns-blazing, ""I can't believe that just happened,"" speed boat ride that it is. I fall into the latter camp, and while both directors have undeniably made more intelligent, deep, well-rounded pictures, there's no denying From Dusk Till Dawn has a certain unusual charm that's tough to nail down. Tarantino's script elaborates loosely on a lot of the social observations he'd originally made in Natural Born Killers, while the film's semi-serious, tongue-in-cheek attitude is an obvious precursor to the superduo's later collaboration on Grindhouse, marking it as an evolutionary milestone of sorts for both. George Clooney steals almost every scene as a take-no-crap heistmeister who's desperate to cross the Mexican border, Harvey Keitel seems unusually understated as the soft-spoken jaded preacher, and Tarantino himself breaks out his C-level acting chops in an appropriately stiff, detached performance as Clooney's creepy, sexual predator of a brother. This isn't quite the joyride I'd remembered it as, but it still provides a few laughs and six barrels full of blood.",From Dusk Till Dawn
74,barnabyrudge,"Outrageous, intentionally trashy comedy-horror-thriller.",6,19 August 2007,"In 1960, Alfred Hitchcock did something unthinkable in the film ""Psycho"". Halfway into the movie he killed off the main character (and the film's biggest star), thereby shocking the audience through sheer unpredictability while simultaneously changing the expected course of the narrative. A similar trick is employed in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (although the two films are nothing alike). For the first half the film is a kinetic crime thriller, characterised by writer Quentin Tarantino's trademark witty, hard-boiled dialogue and a clutch of well delineated characters. At the halfway point, the film suddenly switches to become an ultra-gory, ultra-violent vampire movie, almost a hyperactive homage to ""Night Of The Living Dead""! It is a jarring switch; the effect is like watching half of two separate movies. There is an element of frustration that the serious crime thriller half never gets properly resolved, and similar frustration that the horror half is not introduced and built-up logically. But both halves are undeniably well-made and the actors seem to be having a great deal of fun with their outrageous roles.Psychotic criminal brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Quentin Tarantino) Gecko go on a murderous robbery spree across Texas. Their aim is to cross the Mexican border and rendezvous with one of Seth's buddies, and to ensure their safe passage they take a female hostage. When Richard kills the hostage the brothers are forced to find new ones, so they seize a family travelling in a RV - ex-preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his kids Scott (Ernest Liu) and Kate (Juliette Lewis). After a palm-sweating trip across the border the crooks and their hostages arrive at the rendezvous point, a raunchy biker-/trucker nightclub called the Titty Twister that stands in the middle of nowhere. Seth is hell-bent on getting drunk while waiting for his contact to arrive, but soon has to change his plans when it becomes apparent the Titty Twister is actually the lair of a bunch of super-strong blood-sucking vampires that have been feeding off their customers for years! An all-out gore-fest ensues as the mortals take on the vampires in a battle that literally lasts from dusk till dawn!Tarantino's intentionally vulgar, tongue-in-cheek script is complemented by the frenetic direction of his real-life pal Robert Rodriguez. They are making their own rules here, delivering a movie that cannily taps into the juvenile wish-fulfilment fantasies of tough kids, adding heaps of bad language, gore, nudity and stylized violence. The special effects are quite good, with limbs being ripped out and vampire bodies melting and burning and exploding left, right and centre. Clooney turns in a spirited star-making performance, while Tarantino is OK as his unbalanced brother. Keitel is clearly much too good for his role as the disillusioned preacher but in spite of this he slums it with considerable spirit. Similarly, Lewis doesn't have to register much real acting emotion as the hostage daughter but she enters into the simple-minded violent action with panache. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a raucous, self-indulgent action/comedy/road movie/horror flick - crazy nonsense that was great fun for the cast and crew to make, and is a guilty pleasure for the audience to watch.",From Dusk Till Dawn

76,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Classic horror shoot em up,9,27 October 2015,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a gritty, bloody, psycho southern vampire western birthed of both the different artistic styles of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. It's a hybrid, charging out of the gate with the laconic dialogue and pulpy, cooked to perfection aura of Tarantino's crime outings, then plunges into the slimy, schlock bucket hell of a Rodriguez horror flick. It's that jarring upset in tone that makes it so memorable and hard to pin down in the genre books. George Clooney is an energetic viper as dangerous bandit Seth Gecko, and Quentin Tarantino, who can actually act when he puts his mind to it, is terrifying as his delusional, violent brother Richie, a monster prone to harsh acts of brutality. They are on the run from the Texas law after a violent bank robbery, and following a dusty prologue involving everyone's favourite Texas Ranger Earl McGraw (Michael Parks, his first trip out as the iconic lawman), they kidnap an ex preacher (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) and hightail it to a remote area for some waiting time as Seth plans to meet with a shady associate. It's their rotten luck that the place they pick to lie low, a rowdy hellhole of a roadhouse called the 'Titty Twister', is the last place they should have looked. No sooner have they settled into its chaotic interior, the staff bar the doors and all change into leering Mexican vampires, out to feast on the truckers, bikers and our unfortunate heroes until the sun comes up. From there the film ramps up for one of the biggest, baddest, bloodiest orgy of body parts, gooey effects, stakes through the heart, gunshot wounds galore, and fleshy, latex infested nastiness I've ever seen a horror movie keep up for an hour on end. I'd love to see the budget for practical effects on this one, and work put in. It's an endless parade of freak show proportions, and you'll feel the slime dripping off you when the closing credits come up. You haven't lived until you've seen the human spinal cord played as a saxophone with a screaming head on the end of it. The vamps come in all shapes and sizes too, from Cheech Marin's Chet Pussy (one of the three characters he plays), to Danny Trejo's tough guy bartender Razor Charlie, to sultry Salma Hayek's sexy Santanico Pandemonium. She has a dance sequence with a snake that will have anyone salivating, before she goes full beast mode and terrorizes everyone, that is. Tom Savini is great as Sex Machine, who has a gun for a willy, and Fred Williamson kills it as a nam vet who's seen some stuff, man. Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel provide the movie with what little heart that can be taken seriously among the silliness, and are both excellent. Rodriguez, Nicotero and team seriously outdo themselves in the effects department, turning the climax of their film into a claustrophobic, hairy shoot em up taking place in hell. Clooney has never been more of a bad boy, a tribal tattooed (lol), volatile prick with a good side only drawn forth by the baddest circumstances. Check out the sequels too, especially the third. They're toned down, but still a lot fun. Just avoid the new TV show like the plague, it's crap and doesn't deserve the title. Vampire westerns come in all forms, from poetic (Near Dark), to clunky (John Carpenter's Vampires) to slick (Priest).

77,lukem-52760,One of my most watched films on video back in the 90's!!!,9,21 August 2018,"I love this film so much & have watched a ridiculous amount of times since owning it on video when it first came out but i will admit that even more now as I'm older, i do think that George Clooney was slightly miscast as Seth. I since have found out the Underrated but great, Joe Pilato (Day of the Dead '85) was set to play Seth & oh my he would've been perfect & also in my opinion the also underrated Robert Davi or the also underrated William Forsythe both could've played the part of tough & foul mouthed Criminal Seth, but it is what it is & it's still Clooney's best role & film by far & he's not bad at all but he's just not very convincing as a tough-nut. Still ""Seth"" is a Cool Character & the part shot Clooney to the big stars & like i said he's good & Cool but there's other's who could've pulled the part off probably better.This was a huge film in the 90's a massive instant cult classic & has gotten better & better as the years have gone on.This rugged flick is a perfect ""Late Night"" Film.I first saw this great movie when i rented it on video way back in '96 or '97? I think? But anyway it looked cool on the cover & i thought it was another Crime Thriller like pulp fiction or reservoir dogs so i was so shocked when it turned into a vampire Horror film!!! Such a great twist & one that could not be kept secret today with social media!!!I'm so glad i grew up in the 90's it was so much better back then & i remember hot summer nights up late watching Dusk Till Dawn over & over i even took it a sleepover when i just brought it on video & introduced some friends to it's brilliance & i had the movie soundtrack & constantly listened to it so yeah i was obsessed with this CLASSIC movie & still am.From Dusk Till Dawn means a hell of alot to me for so many reasons & at that time in the 90's i was so into Quentin Tarantino i was watching Reservoir dogs & Pulp fiction & same with Rodriguez i was watching Desperado so the team up was a beautiful thing.From Dusk Till Dawn also opened up a cinema world to me a movie world as it introduced me to old school B-movie stars & Horror icons such as Fred Williamson & Tom Savini & i was a huge fan of both after this vampire film plus i became a big Danny Trejo fan too so my mind was full of this new movie world created by Tarantino & Rodriguez.A nice shock twist & some fantastic characters in this excellent film i mean Seth played well by George Clooney was such a cool, smooth & tough guy character he was AWESOME!!!Also ""Sex Machine"" played by the Horror legend, Tom Savini was a fantastic character & Frost played by the cool as hell B-movie legend Fred Williamson!!! What an excellent cast, Harvey keitel,Juliette lewis,Danny trejo & even Tarantino himself all delivering solid performances, A Fantastic cast. Also the Crime Thriller first half is excellent & brilliantly scripted & shot it's exciting & brutal & then we have the crazy horror second half with some of the greatest vampire FX ever put on screen!!! These are ALSO the best looking/designed vampires in any horror movie ever!!! This is a true Cult CLASSIC & a genuine CLASSIC movie!!!There's been nothing like it or as good since!!! A dusty 70's style road crime Thriller & an 80's style creature feature mixed hybrid that works perfectly & is one of my favourite films of all time it's in my top 5.This really is a crazy & fun, wild ride from a suspenseful Crime Thriller to a Monster Siege Horror. There's lots of great humour sprinkled throughout too & some great characters.Yes i spent many late nights up watching From Dusk Till Dawn & have great nostalgia & memories of this AWESOME movie & i went & brought a book on Tarantino after seeing this it was called King of Pulp.This is easily one of my most watched films of all time & i still know every word it's one of the best scripts for a movie ever!!! Ridiculously quotable & Cool as hell.Infact there's no film out there as Cool & exciting as From Dusk Till Dawn in my opinion.My video of this was on fire i watched it that much & it still amazes me that it flips from a proper Tarantino style Crime Thriller into a full blown Vampire Horror film.It's a unique brilliantly directed movie by the legendary Robert Rodriguez & written by the legendary Tarantino so two BRILLIANT minds at work created this masterpiece.From Dusk Till Dawn owns a big piece of my movie loving Heart & still is the GREATEST vampire movie ever made in my opinion.A little update here as recently a short 2 min promo trailer for From Dusk Till Dawn came out in 1991 directed by legendary fx guy Robert Kurtzman & starring day of the dead star JOE PILATO as Seth Gecko!!! I was shocked it's a little teaser trailer to help raise money for the project at the time back in '91 & i have to admit it that Joe pilato would have made a fantastic & way better Seth Gecko yes a better choice than George Clooney in my opinion as Joe looks tougher & more intense & seems more deadly like a Criminal should & he has that nice back history of being one of the most famous Horror movie villains of all time as Captain Rhodes from Day of the Dead (1985) another Romero zombie CLASSIC.Also Joe Pilato was the FIRST to wear the Black suit/white shirt & thin black tie that's become iconic because of Reservoir dogs & Pulp fiction but Joe Pilato was the first!!!If you watch the promo trailer he looks so cool & his hair is fairly long & slick back & i can see that TARANTINO copied his entire look on to John Travolta as vince in Pulp fiction now I've seen this i honestly think that role of vince as well as Seth should have gone to the great Joe Pilato R. I. P!!! I actually think Tarantino made some wrong choices now for not using a better older genre actor who Tarantino himself was a huge fan of but hey that's my movie mind over thinking as usual but yes pilato would've made a better seth & a better vince & he should have definitely been cast as a reservoir dog!!!!Anyway some films from our childhood or just growing up stick with us for life & this fun Vampire Thriller definitely has stuck with me & owns a special place in my heart along with ""Jaws"" & ""Dragnet"" & ""Ghostbusters 2"" & ""Big trouble in little China"" & some other's that i consider to be in my all time top 10 fave movies!!!I loved & lived the Awesome 90s & ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was a huge part of that defining era of films for me, even though we as movie geeks
Grow & watch alot more films & maybe our tastes even change abit & we enjoy more sophisticated ""Drama"" films or ""Epic"" films or even ""Historical"" films, we always come back to those ""good memory"" & Nostalgic films & remember just why we loved them so much back then!!!I have a big bunch of films that i call my ""Comfort Films"" & those flicks are my safety net from the cold, cruel & harsh Adult world, i can go into my little movie world & feel safe again.I also loved the low budget straight to video sequel starring Robert Patrick.George Clooney was wrong choice for Seth.",From Dusk Till Dawn
78,hu675,Entertaining action extravaganza with plenty of humor and gore.,8,9 January 2009,"Seth Gecko (Oscar-Winner:George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Oscar-Winner:Quentin Tarantino) are vicious low-lifes criminals on the run. Seth is a professional bank thief, who kills if he has to but his brother Richard is much more worse... he also rapes woman for pleasure. The Gecko Brothers are hoping to cross the Mexican boarder somehow but they decided to kidnapped three middle-class people by the name of the Fuller Family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) on their RV. The Gecko Brothers are supposed to meet their contact at a seedy bar in Mexico in the middle of nowhere titled ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". The Gecko Brothers and The Fuller Family, they kidnapped... they are amazed what kind of bar it is. But those dancers, the bartender (Danny Trejo), the band or the sexy owner of the bar by the name of Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek) are not what they seemed to be... they are actually Vampires. They prey on Truckers and Bikers to feed or to turn others into Vampires. While Seth lost his brothers, while nearly everyone in the bar turned into vampires. Now Seth, The Fuller Family and two other survivors (Fred Williamson & Tom Savini) stay together to fight these creatures till dawn for survival.Directed by Robert Rodriguez (The El Mariachi Trilogy, Spy Kids Trilogy, The Faculty) made an entertaining cheesy Horror/Action film with plenty of amusing moments and over the top gore. Director Rodriguez and Screenwriter:Tarantino (Kill Bill Vol.1 & Vol.2, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) certainly have fun with their casting choices. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is one of those movies, where the cast & crew truly seems to be having one hell of a time making this drive-in style movie. Tarantino certainly has an ear for terrific dialogue, especially during the first half of the movie. Which it is totally different from the second half. Although a minor box office disappointment and the critics give this mixed reviews... ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" went on to be a Cult Classic on Video.DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc one has an enjoyable commentary track by Rodriguez and Tarantino, two featurettes (One of them has Commentary with Rodriguez and Make-Up Effects Artists:Greg Nictero) and more. Disc two has an very entertaining documentary titled ""Full Till Boogie"", an fun behind the scenes look with the cast & crew.The Alliance Blu-ray has an sharp anamorphic (1.78:1) transfer and an terrific DTS 5.1 HD Sound. But sadly, the disc has no special features. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" went on to produced two prequels with Rodriguez, Tarantino and Lawrence Bender involved as Executive Producers. But nothing tops the original... it is certainly one of the most remembered Cult Classic films of the 1990's. Don't miss it. Some familiar faces like Cheech Marin, John Saxon, Kelly Preston and more appears in bit parts. Although Marin plays three different characters in the movie. (****/*****).",From Dusk Till Dawn
79,ptb-8,Enough of the 'cool' crap. Please.,2,3 April 2009,"I did not realize exactly how much I detest this film until I saw it again last night. The sight of Tarantino with a gun just makes me want to smash my own television. The sight of Tarantino killing someone makes me want to cry with despair at the state of the film industry. I can only hope that one day George Clooney faints with the genuine realization he chose to be involved in this heinous vile film. Why cannot other people see Tarantino as I see him and his awful cretinous mutilation and degradation films? I cannot be the only one. Every film he makes is sheer humiliation violence towards women. They are not 'cool'. They are designed to ridicule violently every character because Tarantino sets out to defile everyone and everything because he cannot create. He is a destroyer: of images of beauty, of the human form and I am sick of hearing how 'cool' he is and that the films he makes are 'cool'. Clearly every woman in his films and especially this one are simply there for him to manhandle and humiliate, defile and then to kill... that is if he does not get to have rough sex with them first. The scene in the motel with Gloria the hostage who is crying with fear... she gets used as a gun gag and her brains are splattered on the wall. This is so vile and so cruel and especially that as a character in this film she is a middle aged woman, someone's mum and an ordinary woman. Tarantino's psycho character encourages her to relax so he can rape her then blast her face off. This apparently is funny. Hence my rousing identification of the true destructive and defiling nature of this rotten film. The showgirls in the Titty Bar are shown hacked up and tossed in a heap...because all beautiful women in Tarantino films really are monsters and if you don't f**k em first you'd better kill em. Tarantino's films are specifically designed by him to simply rip to shreds anything that is humane and beautiful and of value. His film world is one of emotional and physical brutality and the sheer obvious hatred of women of all ages. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a vile cinematrocity and should be studied for what it truly is. The scene where Harvey Keitel is begging his kids to murder him is just an atrocity on every standard of life any society holds with value. In this film Tarantino has written it as a part of his 'wacky adventure in the dirt'. Next time you have an accident in the street and lay bleeding in terrible pain and some pitiless passerby by says. ""ooh cool' as you pass out from the pain.. think of how well Tarantino has infected their psyche and eroded their humanity via his assault on society by films like this.",From Dusk Till Dawn
80,ferbs54,"""That's What I Call A _______ Show!""",9,4 November 2010,"As most psychotronic-film fans already seem to know, Robert Rodriguez's ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (1996) is a picture that cleaves fairly evenly into two discrete sections. In the first, homicidal bank robber/kidnappers Seth and Richie Gecko (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino), while on the run in Texas, abduct a lapsed minister (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and, in his film debut, Ernest Liu) and force the family to smuggle them into Mexico in a gas-guzzling RV. This is a hard-boiled, suspenseful, oftentimes amusing segment, which abruptly shifts gears as the quintet fetches up at a biker bar in the Mexican wilderness, only to find that the club's habitues are nothing less than bloodsucking, zombielike vampires! And then the fun really begins!Oh, how I did love this hoot of a movie; let me count some of the ways. (1) George Clooney, easily stealing the show here with what is practically an Oscar-worthy performance, as Seth; a relatively sane (when compared to his psycho sex maniac brother, at least!), totally unflappable, wisecracking, tough-as-nails, oddly likable wildman. (2) A crackling, imaginative script by Tarantino, clearly on a roll here after the recent success of ""Pulp Fiction,"" that is loaded with big laffs, pays homage to both classic hostage dramas AND grisly horror flix, and is liberally sprinkled with ""F bombs,"" natch. (3) Some energetic direction from Mr. Rodriguez, whose love for genre filmmaking is evident in every scene in the film. (4) The aforementioned humor, which leavens the drama, the gore and the grue; for example, try not to laff when Seth calls the Juliette Lewis character ""Gidget""! (5) A rocking soundtrack, comprised, appropriately enough, of such staggering Texas-based artists as Stevie Ray and Jimmie Vaughan and ZZ Top. (6) Cheech Marin's spiel in front of the biker bar; truly, a classic, hawking come-on for the ages. And honestly, how cool is it that Cheech plays three separate roles in this film, a la Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness? (7) Salma Hayek as Santanico (NOT Satanico, as widely written) Pandemonium, whose snake dance, with the sounds of Tito and Tarantula performing ""After Dark"" in support, may well be the most awesome scene in motion picture history. Indeed, Salma here, I dare say, embodies what most men would deem the quintessence of pulchritudinous muliebrity. (8) The sight of Clooney, Keitel, FX legend Tom Savini, and blaxploitation hero Fred Williamson battling four vampire chicks...action heaven! (9) The coolest crucifix ever shown in a vampire movie; the one Harvey improvises from a baseball bat and a pump-action shotgun! (10) Some extraordinarily clever violence and carnage, as the hundreds of massed, repugnant-looking vampires are wiped out in dozens of clever ways. I could go on and on, but you get the idea: This movie really is a gas from start to finish, its remarkable final image itself a justification for a sequel. Thinking back on this film afterward, I could only echo Seth Gecko's words, regarding Santanico's performance: ""That's what I call a _______ show!""",From Dusk Till Dawn

It is about two thieves (Clooney and Tarantino((Tarantino is also a murderer)) who take the Keitel, Lewis, and Lui family who take them to a Mexican strip club which is run unbeknownst to them, vampires. It is silly and gory, but at the same time, really great. Michael Parks plays Sheriff Earl McGraw in the opening, and is a great actor. He has been in Kill Bill 1 as Earl(despite the fact that he dies in this one), Kill Bill 2 as a Mexican pimp, From Dusk till Dawn 3 as the star of it and other films.

Whether you are a fan of the vampire genre or every horror movies, From Dusk til Dawn is a movie devoted to the traditional cult movie with its storyline and cast. The most interesting thing about the movie is its cast. You have many big name stars, but none of them are Hollywood esq. actors. Most if not all the actors were at one time in their lives, struggling actors. Many have done independent / low budget movies because they would never say ""no"" to work. Harvey Keitel couldn't find work for years, George Clooney started out on the Facts of Life and Juliette Lewis keeps surprising us all with the kinds of movie roles shes chooses. Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin and Tom Savini add their talents to the movie as well. All three are best examples of actors who got to where they are with their own talent. Neither one had to sell out, use other people or have a cousin working in the industry for them to get an opportunity to be in movies.

83,aidanratesmovies,A Very Odd Mesh of Two Very Different Films,4,19 June 2020,"Although Clooney does give his performance his all, and the film does have its fair share of entertaining moment, sadly From Dusk Till Dawn is a large misfire on part of Tarantino and Rodriguez, as it can't seem to decide what movie or what tone the film wants to be. The film stars George Clooney in the lead role, and though many of his lines are silly, and at times tedious, he gives the performance his all, and is easily the best part about the film. As for the other actors in the film, Quentin Tarantino (who also wrote the film) stars as Richard Gecko, a character in the film seems undeniably forced and his performance feels very out of place. Juliette Lewis also returns for this film, from her previous work on Natural Born Killers but her performance and character is undeniably whinny and incredible annoying throughout, which is sad, considering her talent in past and future works in accordance to this film. The cinematography in the film can be interesting, and very B-movie like, which can make the film easy to watch for the most part. It's tone is incredibly mottled, especially since halfway through the film decides to change its whole face completely from going to a men on the run story to a survival B-movie vampire flick. Not only is this decision incredibly odd, but it feels very out of place as well, as the film just expects you to go along with its sudden change of tones like it is perfectly nature for it to be doing so. It's a very odd film, and it seems almost like Tarantino got bored halfway through the script and decided to do it something more fun. The downside is, the two plotlines don't mix very well, and the film seems to be all over the place. That being said, its special effects can be rather impressive for the time, and though some of the Vampires are quite gross to look at, it's undeniable how impressive it is to manage making them without CGI so well. In the end, From Dusk Till Dawn somehow triumphed my slight distaste for Natural Born Killers and became something incredibly unique, but also something very tonally misplaced.
My Rating: 4.75/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
84,adamjohns-42575,Don't read the synopsis!,7,17 March 2021,"Do not read the synopsis or any other information about this film before you watch it. I picked it up on video when it first came out, not having a clue what it was about or what to expect, but purely because E.R. was at its peak and I fancied George. The front cover gave nothing away, so when I got half way through what was an ok film and it all started to kick off in a way that I had never even thought of, I was very pleasantly surprised.That is the turning point of this film, and you can't miss it. It's where, if you're not enjoying it, you need to stick with it until then and if it doesn't change your mind after it all changes, it's not for you.With regards to the cast-
I personally can't stand Quentin Tarantino, although his films are generally very well made, most of them don't fit my needs, but as an actor he just irritates the hell out of me and I want to do horrible and violent things to his weird face, which is really odd for me as a pacifist. He is just about bearable in this one as that is the type of character he is playing.George, however, is incredibly handsome and there are other things I'd like to do to his face, we won't get in to that, but they're not violent. He is actually very good in the bad boy role and I'd like to see more films with him like that. He's great as a romantic lead, but something about him in this film is just very enjoyable to watch.
It's quite funny and almost like a role reversal to see Harvey Keitel playing a man of the cloth and, as with George, he does a great job too.The supporting cast are all generally a bunch of B movie stars that fit perfectly in what can only be described as an hilariously bad film. And that's where the twist comes in and I refuse to spoil it for you, but it's brilliant in its cheesy, terrible way.I don't know if it was the channel I was watching it on, but the sound was terrible, I had to keep turning it up and down. Other than that, there's not much to moan about. There is some blood and gore, but it's almost comedic in it's over the top presentation.I really like this one and would recommend it.",From Dusk Till Dawn
85,rbverhoef,Silly fun,9,21 November 2004,"'From Dusk Till Dawn' is kind of brilliant, brutal, bloody, Tarantino, horror, silly and funny. It is brilliant, brutal, bloody, horror, silly and funny the way Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead'-series is all those things, the twist here is a screenplay written by Quentin Tarantino. This means the first hour is just brutal and bloody, sometimes a little funny, in the 'Pulp Fiction' kind of way.We see two brothers named Seth (George Clooney) and Richie Gecko (Quentin Tarantino). They are bank robbers, although they do the occasional killing as well. We learn they want to reach the Mexican border. That the entire state of Texas and the FBI are looking for them is a problem so they force the Fuller family to bring them across the border with their motor home. Father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) used to be a minister but gave up faith after his wife died in a car crash. He travels with his adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis).So we have the first hour, filled with Tarantino-stuff in its dialogue and references, and then the party arrives at a bar called the Titty Twister. Not long after they are inside it is revealed that every crew member from the bar is actually a vampire, feeding themselves on bikers and truckers that visit the place. The Fullers and Geckos survive together with a guy who calls himself Sex Machine (Tom Savini) and a guy named Frost (Fred Williamson). Now they are a team and face vampires as their opponents.You see how this movie is actually two movies. Especially the second part will find a smaller audience and in a way I was a little curious how the first part would have ended if they kept it as serious as it was. Still, because the movie shifts the way it does it becomes quite original. We have a crime movie to start and a horror comedy, really in the Sam Raimi way, to end. If you are able to take it the way it comes, not too serious, there is a good chance you might like it. Even the gore is presented in a silly way, making it less gory.Clooney's cool performance, the fitting soundtrack, some hilarious moments, Tarantino's fine touches all make this a highly original, quite bloody, vampire adventure. If you are a genre fan don't miss it, if you are not you might give it a try and be pleasantly surprised.",From Dusk Till Dawn
86,a_chinn,Reservoir Dogs vs. Mexican Vampires,8,1 August 2019,"Incredibly fun genre mash-up from director Robert Rodriguez (""Desperado"" ""The Faculty"" ""Spy Kids"") and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino (""Pulp Fiction"" ""Kill Bill"" ""Hateful Eight""). In what is best described as Reservoir Dogs vs. Mexican Vampires, a pair of low-life criminals, The Gecko Brothers, handsome leader George Clooney and creepy sex offender little brother Tarantino, are on the lamb and headed for Mexico when they kidnap Harvey Keitel and family, Juliette Lewis and her brother, to help them sneak across the border in their RV. One thing that makes this film so fun is that the first half is a pretty straight crime film, but it takes a hard genre turn towards horror when our heroes stop off at a seedy strip club to celebrate their successful border crossing, finding themselves in an establishment run by vampires intent on locking everyone inside and feast upon their blood. From there, the film turns from crime film into a ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Assault on Precinct 13"" style siege film (a nod to which is made by one character wearing a ""Precinct 13"" t-shirt). I remember a friend of mine watching this film with no idea what it was about or there were any horror elements to the film and had his mind completely explode when the bar employees and strippers all of a sudden start turning into vampires, which I thought was hilarious since there is nothing in the first half of the film to indicate that vampires are coming. The second half of the film is pretty heavy on action and vampire slaying, so there's not as much snappy Tarantino dialogue, but is still fun non-the-less. There's also a very cool supporting cast of character that show up in the vampire club including Salma Hayek as a stripper named Santanico Pandemonium, Cheech Marin in three different roles, Danny Trejo as Razor Charlie, Tom Savini as sex Machine, Greg Nicotero, and the always great Fred Williamson. Some other memorable supporting players who appear prior to the vampire bar are John Saxon, Marc Lawrence, Kelly Preston, John Hawkes, and Michael Parks. There's also some fun crossovers moments to other Tarantino and Rodriguez films including Michael Park's Earl McGraw later becoming a recurring character in ""Kill Bill,"" ""Planet Terror,"" and ""Death Proof"". There's also Chango Beer and Sex Machine's codpiece gun that reference ""Desperado."" Big Kahuna Burgers from ""Pulp Fiction"" also make an appearance and would later reappear in ""Death Proof."" Clooney also borrows a line from ""Reservoir Dogs"" with ""All right, Ramblers. Let's get ramblin'!"" Oh, and Tarantino's trademark foot fetish is also present. So for fans of Rodrigues and Tarantino movies, this one is hard to resist. For non-fans, you may not love it as much, but it's still goofy crime and horror film fun. FUN FACT! In return for providing the ear-slicing scene special effects in Reservoir Dogs, Robert Kurtzman asked Tarantino to write the screenplay for ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" based on his original story.",From Dusk Till Dawn
87,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Wild and Fun Vampire Film,9,29 July 2019,"Now this is an interesting film for me, because I recall watching this on the movie channels growing quite a bit. It always seemed to be on. The crazy thing though is I had no idea who Quentin Tarantino was until a bit after and some of the other actors I really didn't know either. To get into this, the synopsis is two criminals and their hostages unknowingly seek temporary refuge in a truck stop populated by vampires with chaotic results.We start this film with Pete Bottoms (John Hawkes) who is working at liquor store. He has a chat with Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), who is a Texas Ranger. They go back and forth until the subject turns to two criminals are on the loose. Earl uses the bathroom and we see that these criminals are there. They're brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Tarantino). They're upset with Pete and just want him to get rid of Earl so they can leave. Richard claims that Pete is tipping off Earl so a gunfight ensues. In the end it leaves Pete and Earl dead with the liquor store up in flames. Seth is irate with Richard as they flee.The two of them hold up in a cheap motel and we see that they have a hostage. She is told the rules of how to survive as Seth leaves to scope out their path to the border. The film then shifts to a family that is on vacation. Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) is a former priest who is having a crisis of faith after his wife passed away. With him are his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and son Scott (Ernest Liu). This family ends up at the same motel.When Seth returns to the room, he finds that Richard has done something to their hostage. This angers him and they have to come up with a plan to get over the border. This leads them to taking the Fuller family hostage. We see that Richard has some mental issues as he thinks Kate asks a pretty vulgar request.They make it across the border and end up at a bar called the Titty Twister. It has a rough crowd and at first Razor Charlie (Danny Trejo) won't serve them. Jacob diffuses the situation when he proves he has a trucker's license and they're allowed to stay. Their attention is adverted when Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek) entices everyone with a seductive dance. The night takes a turn when she and the others that work there reveal what they really are. This becomes a nightmare they'll never forget.As I kind of alluded to, I used to watch this one all the time and I still really enjoy it. It has such an interesting set up for sure. If you had no idea what this film was about, you really get a Tarantino film for the first part of it. It is a crime film where you have Seth who is in charge and is trying to get them across the border. On to the other side you have the psychopath Richard who is sensitive if he is questioned. There is an even more interesting dynamic when you consider how Jacob interacts with Seth. He actually has the gull to call him out, but Seth sees he's right. It just this hardened criminal can be questioned by a former priest. Seth knows that Jacob is right in what he is saying so that really helps.The film takes that dark tonal shift at the Titty Twister, which I also really that aspect. I do have to say that some of the characters are way over the top, like Sex Machine (Tom Savini) who has a gun on his groin. He wouldn't be able to shoot it, but that's the comedy of the film. I will be honest; it does hurt my rating a bit as it does bring down the realism.The vampire part of the film I really like as well. I do find it interesting that there are a few different looks to them. Santanico looks very similar to a snake when she turns, which is interesting as that is what she is dancing with. Others look quite monstrous and you get even more of that from the ones that show up later in the film as well, which are more like bats. It is almost like vampires from all over convene here at night to feed.That brings me to the pacing of the film, which I think is great. I never find myself bored here. There's a great way of introducing the characters that just feels natural and really getting to know them. Even though you know the Gecko brothers are criminals, you worry about them getting over the border. We should be like Scott and want them to get caught, but there's a charisma that makes you question yourself. That is an interesting duality to the film for sure. There is never a lull in the film and I love the reveal at the end of the film. I remember the first time seeing it and just thinking it was great.To move this next to the acting, which is great and I'd say that can really carry the movie. I'm not sure if Clooney ever did horror before or after this, but he is so charismatic that I feel like he is Seth. There is something about him even when he is doing bad things that I had trouble hating him. Tarantino is also great in this film. I love that we get a glimpse of what he thinks he's seeing and it comes off that he's crazy. I thought it worked well. Keitel is really good as normal. Lewis was solid. Hayek was gorgeous and just had my jaw on the floor every time I see her dance. It was fun to see cameos from Cheech Marin, Trejo, Savini, Fred Williamson, John Saxon, Kelly Preston and Hawkes. The cast all really turned in a great performance across the board.That moves me next to the effects of the film. This film was done by KNB, which when I saw that it made since. I think the blood and gore in this film looks really good. It is done practical so that makes a lot of sense. There is some CGI that works in this as well. When you see people changing into vampires, which was fine. There was some CGI that wasn't so good. Some of the flames we see look fake and not all of the looks of the vampires work for me either. I would say that overall it is more positive than negative. The look of how the film is shot is really good as well.The last thing to cover is the music in the film. I really just want to give a shout out to the mariachi band that is playing, because even though it isn't my type of music, they do a really good job. I do have to say it is a bit over the top, cheesy when they reveal themselves to be vampires and what they're using for instruments, but I digress.Now with that said, I still really enjoy this film and it does hold up for me. I love how we get a Tarantino/crime film to start out and it changes into a vampire film in the second half. It just moves so seamlessly. I think that the pacing really helps it there as the film never gets bored and kept me entertained. Not all of the comedy works, but it doesn't ruin the film. Acting really is good here as well and I would have to also say that most of the effects are too. There is some CGI and looks to the vampires that I wasn't high on. The music I think fits for what they needed as well. With that said I think this is a really good film and would highly recommend it, even if you're not a horror fan. I will warn you though, it is pretty bloody",From Dusk Till Dawn

89,raulfaust,Vampires will never hurt you,6,10 November 2012,"Well, this movie begins very violent and similar to Tarantino's movies. Killing for no reason and coldness when dealing with other people. As many people already said, this movie is basically divided in four scenes: the bar scene, the motel scene, the bus scene and the iron maiden rock bar scene. In all scenes characters act the same way, showing they've been properly developed. One implausible thing to notice is how the kids made light of their dad being about to die-- no children act like that, but I can understand it's just a horror movie. I really liked all the scenes until it became a ""Night of the living dead"", full of never ending action scenes, which bores me. All the others scenes are very creative and entertaining, but the undead scenes made me rate this lower than I was ready to do. Good movie anyways.",From Dusk Till Dawn
90,PredragReviews,"""You're telling me I'm not good enough to drink here?!""",8,6 May 2016,"Looking for something that doesn't abide by regular horror genera rules? ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" may be the one to choose. With a sizzling screenplay by Quentin Tarantino and perfectly directed by Robert Rodriguez, this is a horror/thriller to remember. The Gecko brothers are two extremely violent criminals who end up taking a family hostage. The family is forced to drive the notorious brothers to the end of the border. They end up making a pit stop at a Mexican bar, where the brothers are supposed to meet their contact. However, things get out of hand when it turns out that the place is contaminated with vampire strippers and truckers. You add all of those elements together and you get one hell of a ride that you'll never forget. I'm not the biggest fan of vampires, but I thought this was an excellent movie.Probably the best element in the film is George Clooney, as he not only has many of the best lines, but also delivers them in a convincing manner. Harvey Keitel is certain worth watching, yet he seemed to take his part just a bit too seriously at times, in my opinion, but this was offset by Clooney and his underlying jovialness. Lewis, whom I don't care for in general, did alright, and actually looked kinda cute, albeit a trifle skinny for my tastes. Tarantino was probably the weakest element in the film, but at least he and director Rodriguez had the good sense to populate the film with enough talent to offset this factor. If you're not a fan of the graphic violence, then you should avoid this one, as its loaded with visceral goriness.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",From Dusk Till Dawn

It starts of as an everyday Tarantino crime movie with all of his typical trademarks, then suddenly it has vampires killing everyone. Some see the movie as uneven and weird for that reason, but personally I see the vampires as a welcome surprise that add to the surreal atmosphere. They're an extra feature, and a pretty great one at that, because these vampire scenes are really top notch. They're a great combination between over the top violence and morbid humour, a perfect fit for a grindhouse showing. The whole second half of this movie just screams love for the genre, this is essentially a big-budget fan film. They even hired Tom Savini as an actor just because they could. This movie just really gets the adrenaline pumping, which is what I look for in any horror movie, I just rarely find it.

(R)Sibling bank robbers (Clooney, Tarantino) racing for the border take Keitel and his family hostage, their destination a scuzzy Mexican strip bar in the middle of nowhere that (unfortuitously) happens to be a den of monstrous bloodsuckers. As much a tale of two halves as ""Grindhouse"" was (in half the time); for about an hour, it's a nihilistically hip Tarantino crime picture, then it transforms on a dime into a trashy vampire gore-comedy delivered in Rodriguez's in-your-face style. Modestly enjoyable junk has attitude to spare as well as some respectable blood-and-guts special effects and makeup (not to mention enough boundless creativity to negate any attempt at logic/rules-of-lore in the frenetic back end), but a little more restraint and/or better staging would have served it better. In his first role since breaking through on TV's ""ER,"" Clooney proves he has the screen presence and unforced charisma to be a legitimate movie star; Tarantino doesn't fare nearly as well, but it's still one of his least obtrusive showings in front of the camera.

Half of his filmography is unwatchable after a while. The only really good thing about From Dusk t'il Dawn, was the « twist ». One that would be too hard to keep secret these days, with strangers spoiling you everything on the internet. True Salma Hayek was gorgeous, and that dance... But most of the main cast was pretty bad. Tarantino, for starters. How more megalomaniac can you get? And George Clooney, who wasn't even good at being eye candy, let alone a believable bad boy. Had his fickle spotlight, stolen during his scenes with Harvey Keitel, who was without a doubt. One of the highlights of the movie. Juliette Lewis and Kelly Preston did a good job too. And John Hawkes. Cameos at the pub weren't bad either. But it's the biggest let down with this film. Once the infamous twist happens, you know exactly what will happen, and who will survive. I didn't even finish rewatching. The special effects were too ridiculous and aged a lot too. Before that, you had the usual Tarantino treatment. Never ending chat, a certain way of storytelling to be more « stylish ». And the beginning of his foot fetish era. Which begs the question, is he simply overrated, and his vision too closed off?

Scared for his children's lives, he help the murderous duo reach the 'Titty Twister' a dodgy bar in Mexico, and that's where film number 2 begins.Very quickly the movie becomes a vampire slasher flick, that is extremely gory and all in all pretty unexpected.The film remains humorous throughout and never quite takes itself seriously enough to be become cheesy and the cast are all on top form throughout.For its originality and high octane entertainment i give this 9/10. its just sheer mindless (and bloody) fun.",From Dusk Till Dawn
97,sme_no_densetsu,Thoroughly entertaining crime/horror mash-up from Rodriguez & Tarantino,8,11 February 2016,"""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is one of the few Quentin Tarantino screenplays that he didn't direct himself. In a bit of a change, he took an acting role and handed the directorial reins to Robert Rodriguez. A modest success at the time of its release, the movie has since gone on to gain a cult following.The story revolves around a pair of criminals (George Clooney & Quentin Tarantino) who seek refuge in Mexico following a big score. Taking a family hostage, they head to an isolated strip club in order to rendezvous with their contact. However, they get more than they bargained for when they realize that the club is a haven for blood-thirsty vampires.Although basically a B movie, the cast is well assembled. George Clooney, in one of his first starring roles, seems at home delivering Tarantino's snappy dialogue. Tarantino himself is pretty good, too, but easily overshadowed by the likes of Harvey Keitel & Juliette Lewis. Of the supporting actors, Fred Williamson & Tom Savini stand out in particular while Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Michael Parks & John Hawkes all made the most of their limited screen time.Tarantino's script is rife with his trademark dialogue and Rodriguez directed the movie with panache. Unlike ""True Romance"" or ""Natural Born Killers"", I think that Rodriguez's take on the material is pretty close to what Tarantino's would have been. The special effects are handled pretty well also, though rudimentary effects don't necessarily detract from the appeal of a B movie.It seems that the main problem people have with this movie is how it starts out as a straight crime movie before morphing into a horror movie. Personally, I find both parts of the movie entertaining in their own way. With a lively script and a great cast, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" makes for a top notch B movie.",From Dusk Till Dawn
98,Howlin Wolf,In its duplicity lies the film's beauty... (RISK OF SPOILERS. SNIPPETS OF DIALOGUE CONTAIN CONCEALED OBSCENITIES),8,23 May 2001,"The change of pace halfway through helps the film, because although the audience should have been having a perfectly good time up until then, it keeps us glued firmly to our seats lest we miss any more surprises.  The film would surely have flagged had it continued in its linear direction, but the change in tone ensures that's never allowed to happen.  The film begins at almost breakneck pace and never slows down.  The tone of the horror is B-movie stuff, but that's okay, since the characters evidently KNOW they've encountered some surreal events.  Whatever else you can call dialogue from Quentin Tarantino, it's never boring, and the characters are all sufficiently interesting to keep us wondering just how they'll cope with their descent into the maelstrom.  This is supported by the excellent casting.  Whatever the titles may say, Clooney is the real star of the show, as evidenced by my favourite lines section at the end of this review.  The man has charisma to burn, and he displays plenty of it here.   The film is such a compendium of unexpected moments that years from now some instances will be regarded as 'classic'.  Heck, the whole film deserves to be regarded as such for it's daring approach to such an established legend.  You are almost sure to form bonds with the characters, quote the dialogue and reminisce with friends about favourite moments.  It's that kind of film.  Relax, have a few favourite snacks/refreshing beverages handy. Preferably have company while you watch; and have a ball.  It's DEFINITELY not high art, and there are times when it threatens to derail itself completely, but it's glorious fun.MY BEST LINES: -    ""Don't you ever try and f***ing run on us, 'cos I got six little friends, and they can all run faster than you can."" -   ""Is my s**t together, or is my s**t together?""

100,Screen_Blitz,Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino collaboration shows the vampire-horror genre at its best,9,19 November 2015,"Director Robert Rodriguez and producer Quentin Tarantino make their third collaboration after the action film 'Desperado' and the anthology comedy 'Four Rooms' with this exhilarating action-horror extravaganza complete with a brilliant Tarantino script. In this film, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play brothers Seth and Richie Gecko, two wanted felons by the FBI who have committed a string of bank robberies and homicide. In attempt to flee to Mexico, the brothers kidnap a family of three: Jacob Fuller (played by Harvey Keital), a devoted Catholic father who has recently lost his wife, and his two children Kate (played by Juliette Lewis) and Scott (played by Ernest Liu); who are traveling on vacation in an RV. The brothers order them to drive them to Mexico where they end up at an strip club known as ""The Titty Twister"" owned by Carlos (played by Cheech Marin), a Mexican border guard. Things quickly grow awry when the club is revealed to be inhabited by blood-thirsty vampires who ensue a vicious, gore-filled onslaught. The Gecko brothers and the Fuller family team up to defend themselves against the vampire mayhem until the crack of dawn.This action-horror flick present audience with both the amazing action-packed thrills of Robert Rodriguez's style of filmaking and the ingenious style of writing by Quentin Tarantino who also makes an appearance as a main character unlike the brief cameos he's notable for in his films, though his performance may not be on par with his directorial skills. This film basically brings just about everything fans could ask for in both a Rodriguez film and a Tarantino film: top-notch characters, darkly funny dialogue, and an exhilarating plot. Also featuring Salma Hayek who makes an appearance as a sexy bouncer, the film delivers some tense, over-the-top vampire action that while extremely heavy on blood and gore, is very exciting and fun to watch. The beautifully (and scarily) animated vampires will have audience gripping their seats and the intense atmosphere almost perfectly balances the heavy action and scares that will please both action and horror fans. The same can said about the visuals (though slightly cheesy) and production design of the strip club which serves as the main action set for the majority of the film. The performance by George Clooney who is a stranger to roles on the wrong side of the moral compass, sits well as does Harvey Keital who's been collaborator for works by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs).From Dusk Til Dawn sets a textbook example of how an action-horror film should be, and is also one of the best (if not the best) collaborations of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino who later go on to co-directer the B-movie double feature 'Grindhouse' ten years later. If you come across this movie, this would be a good choice for action and horror fans. Although the film isn't anything close to a masterpiece, what is important that is it is fun.",From Dusk Till Dawn
101,pyrocitor,Gruesomely entertaining dark splatterhouse comedy,8,11 October 2006,"From Dusk Till DawnIt is exceedingly difficult to categorize such a film as ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". Indeed, this may be a founded difficulty, as the film seems almost like two very different films each half completed, then mashed together in the middle. At first, the film seems like a standard Tarantino film, with his standard eclectic sense of dialogue and penchant for heavy violence and frequent profanity, following the story of the Geckos, two fugitive outlaw brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) on the run from the cops, trying to make it over the Mexican border with their family of hostages. (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) However, when they reach the seedy Mexican bar arranged as a safe-house for the Gecko brothers however, the film takes an abrupt face. That's when the Rodriguez influence takes over, and the film suddenly turns into a splatterhouse intentionally bad for the sake of being entertaining monster flick, as it is revealed that the bar's workers are none other than... get ready for this... vampires. If it sounds stupid and incredulous... well, it is, there's no doubt about it, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the most ridiculously enjoyable splatterfest black comedies around.It's an odd little combination without a doubt, but for whatever reason, the bizarre mash of Tarantino's stylish wordplay and Rodriguez's later gore-fest seems to click, and the film comes together in a surprisingly entertaining fashion. It's nice to recall in this day and age of gravitas in monster movies that it is possible to make a monster flick only for the sake of being macabre and entertaining. The vampire effects are rather terribly done, but this is probably an intentional aspect, as it fits the oddly comedic tone of the picture perfectly. Only in a movie such as this could a director get away with giving a long monologue about Vietnam before being viciously bitten by a vampire, or a guitarist playing an instrument made out of human body parts. Such instances of coal black humour make up the most memorable parts of the film. Rodriguez also manages to draw impressive performances out of his cast, especially in the case of George Clooney, playing strongly against type in one of his first film roles as Seth Gecko, the tough as nails outlaw who is forced to become a sort of antihero to survive the vampire attack. Harvey Keitel also gives a powerful performance as the father of the kidnapped family, an ex-pastor forced to re-confront matters of faith. Keitel brings a sense of class and dignity to what is without a doubt one of the silliest films he has ever taken part in. Although Quentin Tarantino has received a lot of flack for writing himself into the script, he actually gives a fine performance as Richard Gecko, Clooney's paranoid and homicidal brother. Tarantino serves as the comic relief for most of the film's first half, especially in his first scene. Juliette Lewis gives a decent performance as Keitel's daughter who is also taken hostage, but Ernest Liu as the final kid in the family gives a rather lacklustre and unbelievable performance, almost (but not quite) ruining the superb scenes when Clooney talks to his hostages while riding their stolen RV. Salma Hayek also makes a sumptuous addition to the film, performing her snake dance, one of the most memorable stripteases in film history... without even removing any clothes!For those with low thresholds for gore or swearing, or those seeking out a more realistic and enlightening film, it is doubtful From Dusk Till Dawn will prove to your tastes. But for those willing to leave reality at the door and just enjoy a ridiculous yet absurdly entertaining vampire romp complete with intentionally inferior special effects and enough blood and gore to satisfy even the most bloodthirsty viewers, fraught with comedy as black as the night, this is the film for you.-8/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
102,oneguyrambling,Forget Death Proof - THIS is how the other half of Grindhouse should've looked,8,27 November 2010,"Written by Tarantino back in his video shop employee days, and directed by Robert Rodriguez fresh off his Desperado breakout, From Dusk Till Dawn is really two episodes combined to make a fun, funny and original, yet totally off-the-wall film.It also had an in-her-prime Salma Hayek dancing in a bikini with an albino snake wrapped around her neck - never a bad thing.Ever.The opening scene has Earl and Pete yakking up a storm in the local bottle-O. Among other things they discuss a local string of crimes perpetrated by two low life brothers named Seth and Richie Gecko, that include robbery, murder and kidnapping. It seems they are headed for the border which will mean they go right through the local area. Earl hopes that will be the case, he is the local sheriff after all.A quick reveal shows that Seth and Richie are indeed nearby, and after an action packed and frankly hilarious shootout they leave the smoldering remains of the bottle-O and hit the road.The Gecko's aren't your regular petty crims, Seth (George Clooney) is the heavily tatted mastermind, cool, calm and calculated. All business. While Richie is deeply insecure, cold-bloodedly violent and basically f*cking nuts, always a good combo.They are indeed on the way to Mexico, to be more specific a backwater town named El-Ray, where they will be meeting their fence, (the guy who will buy the stolen goods), but first they must cross the border, where they are Public Enemy #s 1 & 2.Enter Jacob, Kate and Scott, a family on holiday in their camper van. Jacob has lost his wife in a car-wreck, which made him question his faith to the point that he has given up his role as a Priest, Kate and Scott are his children, the fact that Scott is of Chinese descent is acknowledged but never explained.Seth and Richie abduct the entire family and demand that they escort them across the border to safety, now even though Jacob has a troubled past he is still humble, yet steely determined, and he initially says ""no chance"". That is until Seth threatens to sic Richie onto Kate.Now to expedite proceedings after some shennanigans they find themselves across the border and in Mexico, where Seth directs them to a local bar called the Titty-Twister for celebratory beers.Now up to this point the happenings in this film were only improbable. Here it gets a little bit crazier.At the totally O.T.T. Titty Twister the Tarantino part of the film ends, the rest being all Rodriguez. The bar is populated by heaps of familiar character actors and film personalities, a short list includes Cheech Marin, Tom Savini, Greg Nicotero, Danny Trejo and Fred Williamson, Salma arrives later. The bar has strippers and crazy dancers, an inhouse band, surly staff and dangerous looking clientèle.Nice.After some petty fights involving various staff and drinkers, (featuring what I would venture a guess as being the first genital cannon in cinema outside of porn!) the tone slips down a notch, as Salma arrives.53 minutes running time.Salma plays Satanico Pandemonium, the exotically named, exotic looking, exotic dancer, complete with the previously mentioned albino reptile. Over the next three or so minutes she puts on a dance that has the bar transfixed, and I dare say many bars in the audience were transfixed from this point too.Now up to this point the happenings in the film were only wildly improbable. Here it goes cuckoo-f*cking-bananas! 58 minutes running time.Salma, (as we know it) moves on, and all sh*t breaks loose.The remainder of the film has scant plot aside from the fact that our characters are beset by honest to goodness vampires from this point on until the credits. There are numerous sightgags, some effects work that is equal parts dodgy and inspired, and gore galore, but all of it more cheesy than cringe-inducing.Most ""standard"" vampire rules apply, stakes, holy water, crosses etc and the small group of surviving non-bloodsuckers must make it to dawn to see if the final rule, that of death by sunlight, applies.There is some great dialogue, frenetic action and inspired chaos, there are also some quite hilarious intermissions, most notably Fred Williamson's 'Nam recollections that seem to ramble on and on, all the while becoming more animated.While this isn't as critically embraced as Pulp Fiction or even Sin City, and with reason, From Dusk Till Dawn is amazingly efficient genre-busting film-making. I've said before you can't watch the same film over and over again without getting bored, you need some variety, something different sometimes.The fact is that From Dusk Till Dawn is likely totally different from almost anything you'll watch this year. But it is also a great film, and hugely entertaining.Final Rating – 8 / 10.

105,baumer,Is there a better actor than George Clooney?,8,28 June 1999,"Okay, first of all let me just make this very clear.  I have never watched one single episode of ER in my life ( honest ).  So what I am about to say has nothing to do with some ridiculous love for the show.  Having said that, let me tell you that George Clooney makes this film the classic that it is. It is a great fi, because of Tarantino's writing and Rodriguez' style and it has a fun story and the other actors are really good in it.  But there is just something about Clooney that makes every scene that he's in believable. His interpretation of Seth Gecko is so amazing and so believable.  Take for instance the scene in the bar when he is teaching Kate how to slam a shooter.  He downs his own and then slams his glass down three times on the table.  It is tiny subtleties like this that make his interpretation of his character so real.  Every scene that he is in is a lesson in acting.  He can take any dialogue, whether it is bad or good and hit just the right note. Take for instance the film A Thin Red Line.  Now that was a really really really bad movie.  But when he was on screen for 30 seconds, it made me forget that it was a bad movie and I was  absorbed by what his character was saying.  Now that is power.Someday Clooney is going to win an Oscar and when he does people will look back at his career and say "" You  know what?  He was really good in that weird Tarantino film. ""  And I'll say I told you so.This film is a lot of fun and it has a lot of twists and turns and plus Tom Savini is in the film and that is worth seeing as well.

106,blott2319-1,Half of a decent movie,4,20 July 2020,"Let's just start this review off with a clear warning that I will spoil some plot points of From Dusk Till Dawn. There is something that changes about halfway through the film, and if you don't know about it, you should probably see the film before reading my thoughts on it. I simply can't figure out a good way of expressing my frustrations without being up front about what happens, so to avoid spoilers, stop reading now! The first half of From Dusk Till Dawn is a dark and harrowing experience. If I didn't know where the plot was headed before I sat down to watch it, I think I would have been on the edge of my seat. Clooney and Tarantino are pure evil, and I appreciated that the film didn't do much of anything to try and convince me these were redeemable characters. Instead, they introduce some people who are supposed to be the righteous ones that we can root for when everything hits the fan. I struggled a lot with the horrible writing for Harvey Keitel and his family, though. You could easily see this was penned by someone who has little to no experience being around religious people. If they hadn't explicitly told the audience that Keitel's character was a former minister, there would be no way to tell by his demeanor or the way he spoke.Of course, applying logic to anyone's behavior in From Dusk Till Dawn kind of goes out the window when vampires show up. I knew it was coming, but when it hit, this movie went from moderately interesting to utterly worthless. The entire plot of the movie is abandoned so that our characters can spend the latter half of the runtime in an insane free-for-all battle. All sense is abandoned and I guess we're supposed to just be giggling with delight as we watch people tearing each other apart. I was particularly annoyed with the inconsistent magical rules of these vampires. One minute a gun is only a minor deterrent, the next a single gun blast can destroy 3 of them. Sometimes they are easy to pull apart with your bare hands, other times they are tough as nails. Also, the mere idea of these vampires doing this every night is ludicrous and stupid if you apply any second of thought to it, but (again) it doesn't seem like they want you thinking. Instead, shut off your brain and watch a dude ripping a vampire's heart out with his bare hand and stabbing it with a pencil. Isn't that cool?!?! Obviously it is for some people because this movie is popular and it spawned a number of sequels. Needless to say, it's not for me. Even the dialogue lacked the witty banter that I expect from a Tarantino script. I'll still give From Dusk Till Dawn some credit for a solid plot setup, it's just too bad the follow-through wasn't for the same plot.",From Dusk Till Dawn
107,jaredmobarak,"I'm Sex Machine, pleased to meet yaFrom Dusk Till Dawn",8,7 October 2007,"This year's Grindhouse was not the first of such collaborations between Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. One could argue that their production of From Dusk Till Dawn laid the seeds for that schlock-fest extravaganza. I remember while watching Planet Terror thinking how overboard Rodriguez was going, and loving every minute of it. Revisiting this film, however, showed how he didn't stray too far from where he had already been. Sure Tarantino's dialogue is at the forefront for much of the film's duration, but when the action amps up and the vampire gore starts splattering, one can see the connection with Rodriguez's later film. Overall, this movie delivers big time. The laughs are many, the pop culture references are sprinkled throughout, the characters are all fully fleshed no matter how little screen time they are given, and the action is great to watch.The story is a simple one. The Gecko brothers have pulled off a heist and need to get to Mexico in order to pay off their partner. They kill and steal along the way until meeting up with a pastor who has lost faith and his two children in an RV. Taking the family hostage, they make their way south to a sleazy topless bar awaiting said partner's arrival. This specific bar, however, is inhabited by vampires who feed on its customers once the sun goes down. What is first a crime tale of men on the run soon turns into a fight for survival against the supernatural.While Rodriguez handles the directing well, showcasing some nice special effects and make-up work, it really is the script that shines. Tarantino has crafted a tale with just enough realism to keep it from going too far overboard. The dialogue is sharp and with himself and George Clooney starring, the delivery is spot-on. Quentin's Richard is a lunatic, pedophile/rapist who recently broke his brother Seth out of jail so they could complete this job. Seth is the brains of the operation and understands all the angles. His temper leads to many great one-liners and his release of tension when they cross the border successfully gives us even more. The relationship between the two is classic and I don't see Tarantino giving a better performance ever. His low-key psychopath is effective and I love his soft delivery of lines when his brother is not in the room to hear him.Our entry point into the film opens the action perfectly with what on the surface appears to be a generic scene between a sheriff and a gas station proprietor. When the officer goes to the bathroom we are finally able to meet the Gecko boys and understand what is really happening. Richard goes crazy, Seth shows his vindictive side, and John Hawkes is brilliant as the man stuck in the middle, doing what he is told, but subverted at all times by Richard's bloodlust. The rest of the film, until they meet the family that sticks with them to the end is full quality dialogue and acting. That family consists of Harvey Keitel, great in a role that is uncommon for himthe good guy, Ernest Liu as the son, with a nice realistic turn, and Juliette Lewis as the daughter, giving many memorable moments, especially opposite Tarantino.It's when they arrive at the Mexican bar and the vampires show themselves that the film really picks up. The script remains witty, but the supernatural flair infused with it brings a freshness that keeps the film from ever hitting a rut. Cameos are plenty, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek, Tom Savini, and Fred Williamson among others, blood and guts are everywhere, and the violence rises to a crescendo. Clooney is allowed to run free, to great effect, with Keitel there at all times injecting a bit of calm wisdom whenever possible. From Dusk Till Dawn is far from a masterpiece, but it is fantastic entertainment and can be played with Grindhouse to create a highly enjoyable night of carnage.",From Dusk Till Dawn
108,mattymatt4ever,TWO WORDS: AWE-SOME!!!!,8,24 September 2001,"""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is one of those films that never tires out, no matter how many times I've seen it (which is well over 100).  With Quentin Tarantino's brilliant writing and Robert Rodriguez's flashy direction, how can we go wrong?  Though Tarantino didn't take the director's seat, it has that priceless Tarantino feel.  And rarely do I watch a film where the uniqueness of the screenwriter shines through, even though it wasn't directed by him.  Thanks to Tarantino's magic dialogue, we're blessed with some of the most quoteable lines in movie history:  ""If you make a noise, Mr. .44 makes a noise; if you ask a question, Mr. .44 answers it.""  ""I said 'plant yourself.' Plants don't talk.""  ""Don't you ever try and f**kin' run on us...because I have six friends, and they can all run faster than you can.""  I practically have every line from the movie stored in my head and I love watching the film on repeat viewings and screaming out the lines with the actors. 
Rodriguez created some spectacular action sequences.  That opening scene in the liquor store is breathtaking.  The flashy special effects and lavishly original slam-bang action in the strip club is also breathtaking.  This movie makes you wanna cheer!One of the key elements that adds to this film's engaging quality is the character development.  How often do you watch an action film where two characters are about to get killed, yet there's a character development sequence preceding their death?  That's how the movie opens.  The tone is set with a conversation between an overworked Texas ranger (Michael Parks) and a puny liquor store clerk.  All the other characters are well-developed as well.  Yet the development of these characters never seem to ruin the pace.  In fact, it brings you into the film even more.   
The rugged soundtrack helps accentuate the rugged Southern feel.  The performances are great.  George Clooney is a very convincing villain, and was perfectly cast.  Quentin Tarantino is good as his paranoid, whiny, perverse, psychotic brother--though I don't know if that's much of a stretch for him.  The great Harvey Keitel gives a brilliant, subtle, underrated performance as a faithless former minister, who now has to regain his faith when faced with these demons (vampires) from hell.  I think it's one of his best performances, and definitely a lot different from his usual roles. Cheech Marin is amusing in three (that's right!  three!) performances:  a border patrol guard, a greasy bouncer and a Mexican dealer.  Eddie Murphy, look out!  Juliette Lewis, though she's significantly older than the character she's playing, plays a nice supporting role.  Another score for the tremendously talented actress!  You go, girl!  Newcomer Ernest Liu gives a fine debut performance as Keitel's adopted Japanese son.  Salma Hayek is sexy as ever in the role that put her on the map.  Personally, I felt the film worked out better as a crime drama than a horror movie.  I enjoyed the second half, but I enjoyed the first half a lot better.  The horror portion is very well-done, and not the least bit cheesy, but the film seems to go a little off-balance in its transition. Nevertheless, it's still a blast!  And Rodriguez is very original in reprising one of the most-known sub-genres of horror:  the vampire movie. He does a great job at combining dark comedy with the gratuitous violence and gore.  For example, when Cheech turns (into a vampire) he approaches the terrified Juliette Lewis and says, ""You know what people say about me:  I suck!""  The montage sequence where the remaining heroes prepare weapons to defeat the ghouls in the bloody climax is very nifty.  Let's just say this is the first vampire movie I've seen where a character is armed with condoms filled with holy water.  ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a macho guy flick with style and substance.  One to cherish and enjoy over and over again.  I love this movie!!!My score:  8 (out of 10)",From Dusk Till Dawn
109,jhclues,An Embarrassment,1,2 July 2002,"A promising beginning quickly gives way to shameful exploitation and excesses that are unworthy of the participants involved, and even the most adept rationalization will not excuse them from taking part in a project that is so blatantly devoid of anything even remotely close to possessing any redeeming aspects or qualities whatsoever.  Screenwriter Quentin Tarantino and director Robert Rodriguez had apparently attained the kind of stature within the right kind of circles that gave them free reign going into the production of `From Dusk Till Dawn,' and the results are something akin to what happens when you turn a couple of undisciplined youngsters loose in a toy store and then refuse to hold them accountable for the mess they make.  The thing is, the people involved here are artists, who collectively and individually, have proven themselves capable of achievements beyond the norm; and as an audience-- collectively and individually-- that is what we have come to expect from them.  And that's not saying that every time out Tarantino has to give us a `Pulp Fiction,' or that Clooney or Keitel are expected to turn in an Academy Award worthy performance.  But given their credentials, it is not out of line to expect them to deliver a product that includes at least some semblance of dignity, integrity and quality.  And, unfortunately, none of the above are to be found anywhere in this `B-' schlock Rodriguez and Co. have fostered upon an unsuspecting public.The degradations begin when the morally bankrupt Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino), go on a spree of murder and robbery on their way to Mexico, where they're to meet up with a colleague who will provide them with a safe haven-- for a price, of course.  Near the border, to facilitate their crossing, they kidnap a minister, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), and his children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). Seth sees the motor home Jacob is driving as the perfect vehicle to get them to their destination, and the recently widowed Jacob-- who is currently struggling with his faith-- sees no choice but to go along with the demands of his captors.  What Jacob cannot know, however, is that he will be taking them to a rendezvous that will deposit them all veritably at the gates of Hell.In the opening scene, a Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), walks into a somewhat secluded liquor store where he has a conversation with the young clerk, during which they discuss the news of the Gecko brothers.  Of course, Seth and Richie are already at hand, and the ensuing violence sets the stage for all that follows.  And right up to the part at which the first shots are fired, courtesy of a riveting, if all too brief, performance by Parks (this is actually the film's best scene), it's actually a good beginning to a very bad movie.  At this point, the film has had it's moment, and it's all downhill from there.With this screenplay, Tarantino-- who made a name for himself (and rightly so) with `Pulp Fiction' and `Reservoir Dogs,'-- developed a blueprint for excessive (even for him) violence and moral abasement, then handed it over to Rodriguez, who took the ball and ran with it.  Straight down into the ground.  The characters and situations created in this film give a negative value to human life and propriety, even taken within the broadest cinematic terms of expression.  And the use of advanced technology and F/X by Rodriguez toward such an end as this is contemptible.  Totally without redeeming value, this film appeals to nothing more than the basest instincts of the infantile mind, and is an embarrassment to the craft of filmmaking.If you bother to sift through the detritus of this visual and psychological malady, you will actually find a decent performance by Clooney, though given the context in which it exists, it will take an extremely objective eye to discern it at all.  Seeking out a good performance here is like attempting to remedy the stench of a pig sty with a can of air freshener.  And it's tough watching someone you admire as an artist wallow (and willingly yet) in such claptrap as this.As far as the participation of Harvey Keitel in this, one can only wonder what could have prompted such a decision.  In fact, one can speculate that Jacob Fuller's loss of faith occurred after he read this script.The supporting cast includes Salma Hayek (Santanico Pandemonium), Cheech Marin (in three roles), Danny Trejo (Razor Charlie), Fred Williamson (Frost) and Kelly Preston (Newscaster Kelly Houge).  A disaster that should never have been allowed to see the light of day, `From Dusk Till Dawn' will no doubt find it's own niche in the `cult film' Hall of Fame, and unfortunately there are those who will embrace this nonsense out-of-hand.  If made by amateurs or an aspiring filmmaker who simply did not know better, the existence of this film would at least be understandable and acceptable within the context of those given terms and conditions.  But with the names and talents of the likes of Tarantino, Clooney, Rodriguez, Keitel and Lewis attached, there is no excuse for it; no excuse whatsoever.  In the final analysis, this is nothing more than a demonstration of the blatant misuse of the magic that is the movies.  I rate this one 1/10.",From Dusk Till Dawn
110,phubbs,From Dusk Till Dawn,7,27 July 2014,"Back in 1986 there was a small low budget horror movie called 'Vamp' starring Grace Jones as a supreme vampiress Goddess and owner of a seedy strip joint full of seedy hooker-esque strippers...it was spanklicious! Then along came Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez and they basically completely ripped off the entire idea, thus we have this heavily Mexican influenced horror splatter fest.I saw this film on release in the cinema back in the day and I thoroughly enjoyed it, this hasn't changed. I think the fun fact with this film is that it works on two levels, as we all know the film is basically one story that U-turns into another, but both work really well. The first half of the film which focuses on the 'Gecko Brothers' is a violent unapologetic crime spree road trip following the duo on the lamb. Its a strange combination of ice cool badassery and actual nastiness leaving you unsure whether you should be rooting for these two guys. Lets face it, Clooney is the slightly charming good looking cool headed leader of the pair sporting a horribly dated tribal tattoo. This guy makes you think its fun and sexy to be a criminal on the run from the law...in a cool car to boot. Then you have Tarantino who is a scrawny whiny bespectacled creep who lies and kills people for no reason, he also appears to be a sexual predator and kills (possibly raping) women. Now together this pair do make a fun fast talking duo of deperados admittedly, their bickering is amusing and well performed, visually they look quite unique in their appearance and attire and they are badass motherf*ckers. The thing is they do commit some really quite nasty crimes along the way which is played for dark laughs but it leaves a bad taste in your mouth. You can't help but feel they get what they deserve in the end and I personally find it hard to feel any emotion or sympathy for either character. Its like...oh yeah its sad for 'Seth' when 'Richie' gets killed...but wait, didn't he kill an innocent female by putting a pillow over her head and shooting her in the face?! Oh and didn't Seth burn that innocent (and cooperative) liquor store worker to death??!!The main crux of this film is of course the second part of the story when the duo reach the 'Titty Twister' in the middle of nowhere, Mexico. From a dark graphic novel style violent crime thriller to an over the top, balls to the wall, in your face soft porn vampire slaughter. What I like about this section of the film is the fact they use hands-on effects, the whole gamut of traditional methods from models and puppets to bucket loads of goo and gore. I think there is a small amount of CGI for the bats and face morphing but mostly all the death and destruction is utilising classic live action gore effects and some lovely makeup work that I'm sure Savini had a hand in. Even though the Titty Twister is an obvious set it still looks the business both inside and out with clever use of props and camera angles. You know there aren't that many vampires, you know the bar set isn't that big, you know the outside is restricted for space etc...but with the odd lorry parked in the right position, good editing, some clever tricks and even an old fashioned matte painting Rodriguez is able to present a much bigger universe on a tight budget.I think this part of the film has its ups and downs honestly. Its definitely a rip roaring brutal cadaver fest which is great fun but as the film progresses towards the finale it does become so over the top with the gore and action it loses its grip and edge. The effects seem to get a little weaker towards the end as though they were running out of cash and time. The makeup is still great but some of the creatures looked pretty ropy truth be told, what was that huge rat monster Clooney fights?! kudos for trying but the rod puppet animation used for that thing was hokey looking. I also always wondered why Hayek's character seems to turn into a humanoid reptile, that's what it looked like didn't it? not very vampire-like. The various exploding melting head close ups rock but most of the body suits and large vampire bats look very rubbery and fake right at the end.There is no doubt this is another great example of Rodriguez's visual style and somewhat over self-indulgent obsession with the Mexican theme. The added bonus of a solid cast of Tarantino regulars and aging cult stars really gives the adventure a shot in the arm too, had this been cast with any standard Hollywood stars it may not have been as appealing. I mean lets face it, this film introduced us to Hayek, Trejo and to a degree Marin for some folk...loved how he plays multiple characters and pulls it off!A true popcorn flick harking back to the good old days of 80's splatter comedy horror. What's more it makes you wanna see more of the Gecko Brothers with a prequel and easily a sequel following Seth. I won't deny the first half of the film felt vicious and a tad unpleasant, could almost say a fail for what they were clearly going for, but what horror/action fan can say they didn't get a solid kick out of the biker mayhem that followed. Easily my fave film involving and starring Tarantino, I just loved how they did his vampire makeup too, did you notice how his skull had a massive chin?7.5/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
111,aciessi,Soul-Suckingly Good,9,14 June 2015,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a bad-ass horror comedy. A blood drenched good time, with an amazing script written by, who else but Tarantino? It felt like two separate films, which is the coolest and strangest thing about it. It's a violent crime drama for the first hour, and then a wild horror comedy for the last half hour. Some call it indecisive, but when you tell Tarantino to make a horror film, this is the exact thing he'd come up with. The only thing is, if it were directed by him, it would've been such a masterpiece. Without him in control of every aspect of production, it just seems like something is missing. Robert Rodriguez isn't exactly a great director, and sometimes, you can see that here. Bad CGI anyone? Ah, who cares? I enjoyed the hell out to this thing.",From Dusk Till Dawn
112,jluis1984,Great action-packed thrill ride!,8,25 May 2006,"Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are probably the two most recognizable faces of the generation of filmmakers who had their start in the independent scene of the early 90s. Rodriguez had a tremendous success with his western-inspired action movie ""El Mariachi"" while Tarantino reached fame and glory after updating heist movies in ""Reservoir Dogs"". Their friendship lead them to make movies together starting with ""Four Rooms"", but together with make-up masters Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger the two young directors crafted one of the most original movies of the 90s: ""From Dusk Till Dawn"".The plot starts with the escape of two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Tarantino himself) and their effort to reach Mexico kidnapping the family of a faith-less preacher named Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) who was traveling with his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and his son Scott (Ernest Liu). In their escape the group will arrive to a Mexican strip club where nothing is what it seems.The story (by Kurtzman) is a very good mix of action, western and horror cleverly put together in Tarantino's witty script. Rodriguez direction gives the film the a 70s feeling that gives the movie a Drive-In spirit pretty much in tone with the plot. In fact, at times the film feels like an updated version of exploitation action films of that era. This lack of pretensions makes it even more enjoyable as it never tries to be something else than pure entertainment.The movie is interestingly divided in two, the first half dedicated to establishing the relationships between the characters, particularly the complicated clash of the Geckos and the Fullers, in a typical Tarantino style crime/drama fashion; on the other hand, the second half is an action packed thrill ride on the style of 70s action movies that clearly shows John Carpenter's influence over Rodriguez. While it is definitely a tribute to their influences, the Rodriguez/Tarantino team create a solid movie that stands on its own as a very original take on horror movies.The acting is very effective, with George Clooney carrying the film as the cool-headed older brother who has to take care of his psychotic younger brother. Tarantino is average, but he was certainly having fun with the role. Keitel is terrific as always and is perfect as the faithless pastor who doesn't trust in God anymore. Apearances by Salma Hayek and make-up virtuoso Tom Savini have small but unforgettable roles. Savini steals the film in his role as a biker that brings back memories of his part in Romero's classic ""Dawn of the Dead"". All in all is a very complete and solid cast that certainly gives the movie a very special flavor.The special effects by KNB are top-notch, but the CGI used in some scenes is poor when compared to the traditional prosthetic make-up employed in the rest of the film. While the violence is never intended to be realistic, the poor CGI at times make it look more cartoon-like than what it was supposed to be, but it is not a real damaging flaw and the film is still highly enjoyable.Rodriguez has always done films to have fun, and this is what has set him apart from other filmmakers (Tarantino included). His lack of pretensions and his dedication to his craft seem to transmit the fun he has making movies to the audience who watches them. While his films may not have an introspective depth or a high philosophical meaning, they work perfectly as entertainment of the highest quality. This underrated film is probably among his best and most enjoyable films of his young career. 8/10",From Dusk Till Dawn

Great performances by Tarantino and Clooney (they rule), Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel are not too bad either.

118,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,A Black Comedy turned Nightmare,7,21 October 2009,"This film is perhaps most famous for its twist about halfway through the story. It is quite a twist on the film's reality, I'd say comparable to the one in ""The Matrix"" in that absolutely nothing is the same after. Also, like in the aforementioned film, the twist makes sense... but only if looked at from a certain point of view.The story goes from a caper black comedy with a pair of crooks who are on their way to Mexico to escape US law enforcement. They take some hostages and narrowly slip through the border and to a meeting point, a bar with exotic dancers. It seems that their dreams are just about to come true and they'll be sipping margaritas safe from the confines of prison... but then what happens? Our very frightened protagonists find themselves locked in the bar, that is now basically a prison, but it is not run by law enforcement officers, it's worse. It's not even run by the Gestapo... it's worse! No, this place is worse than their worst nightmares and too bad for them that it is real, since it seems everyone has been given an automatic death sentence. The bar is run by vampires who feast on visitors in order to stay alive.Is the twist odd? Yes, very much so, but with a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, only some sort of off the wall unconventional twist can be expected. Tarantino himself has a supporting role as the very weird and deranged brother of George Clooney's character. At this point Tarantino was known for crime capers and to an extent this is one too, but it fits into Tarantino's list of movies the way his character is in the film: a total weirdo with a penchant for violence. Also Robert Rodriguez has yet to make something quite like this as well...Overall, this is an odd and very violent movie that is decidedly not for all tastes, but it's dark wit and sense of humor cannot be denied. See it to get a glimpse of something quite different. --- 7/10BsCDb Classification: 16+ --- violence/gore",From Dusk Till Dawn
119,bellino-angelo2014,It truly deserves its cult status after 25 years,9,7 February 2021,"I was always curious about this movie as it has been quoted by many famous movie critics and it's considered a cult movie from the 1990s. And it's also famous because it was George Clooney's first major movie (at the time he only did a few minor ones and was famous for the TV show ER). And after I saw it four months ago I had to agree with everyone that considers it a classic and a cult movie since I loved it very much.The movie begins with brothers Seth and Richard Gecko (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) that are bank robbers and in the beginning they blow with explosives an entire liquor store. Since the entire state of Texas and the FBI are after them they don't have any other choice than reach the Mexican Border. So they casually meet Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and force him to go in their motor home along with his kids Scott and Kate (Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis). After some road they go to a night club called the Titty Twister. After the sun goes down the leads find out that everyone who works there is a vampire that feeds on bikers and truckers' blood. The Geckos and Fullers join forces with a guy known as S** Machine (Tom Savini) and a black guy named Frost (Fred Williamson) and they face vampires as their opponents.This movie is actually two movies in one. In the first half is a crime movie and then the movie shifts to an horror comedy. If you take this change not too serious, as the way it comes, you will appreciate it very much. And the horror is not that gory, so even non horror fans can like this movie without being disgusted.The acting is pretty good by everyone. Clooney, Tarantino and Keitel are all good together as also a very young Juliette Lewis. The movie is filled with supporting roles and even cameos by many famous faces of those years: Marc Lawrence as an old timer in an hotel, John Hawkes (who a year later played a mugger in STEEL with Shaquille O'Neal), Kelly Preston and John Saxon in the news reports scene (who quite coincidentally passed away in the same month of the same year), Salma Hayek in her first major American movie, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, Michael Parks and the always great Danny Trejo that as always gives one of his usual remarkable performances.This is quite a funny, intelligent and original vampire movie. If you are a fan of the genre I bet you probably saw it yet, but if you are not and you are just a movie buff (like me) you will be pleasantly surprised and glad of spending nearly two hours of watching it.",From Dusk Till Dawn
120,mario_c,"Like GRINDHOUSE, this movie is half Tarantino, half Rodriguez",8,13 April 2008,"This film is a bit peculiar because it mixes two very different kinds of plot and movies' genres, and that's just because of that it works so well. In the ""first half"" we watch a crime story with two outlaw brothers, SETH GECKO (played by George Clooney) and RICHARD GECKO (Quentin Tarantino) running away from authorities, after robber a bank and kill a few people. They kidnap a family, composed by a Pastor who lost his faith, JACOB FULLER (Harvey Keitel), his daughter KATE (Juliette Lewis) and his son SCOTT (Ernest Liu), and cross the border into Mexico. Arriving there they all go to a motorcyclist's bar, in the middle of nowhere, which claims it self to be ""open from dusk till dawn"". The ""second half"" begins! After a great show by ""SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM (Salma Hayek)"", a bloody and gory fight starts between these mentioned characters (and some new and funny ones which only appear in the bar, like the ""SEX MACHINE"") and some vampires (which are the owners of the bar and the stripper girls). A very different kind of plot and ""movie"" begins! From a crime and kidnapping story it passes to a gory vampire slasher! The main idea is quite original and funny, and we can feel Tarantino's touch on it. The screenplay is from him, in spite of the original story not be. I think it's another classic of the 90's, not because it's an excellent movie, but because its main idea worked very well and was quite refreshing. I also appreciated its humor and the great acting from the main actors. Tarantino included! The soundtrack is also fine, especially when they arrive at the bar. On the other hand, we can also notice Robert Rodriguez's directing through the many action scenes, done in his personal style In fact, I would say it was the first experience where Tarantino and Rodriguez joined their personal styles to create a film. We can watch such idea more developed and matured in their recent GRINDHOUSE, but I think it was the very beginning. Because like GRINDHOUSE I think this film is separated in two very different parts: the first one with Tarantino's cinematographic style; and the second one with Rodriguez's!",From Dusk Till Dawn

The exception being Ernest Liu who does a good job of holding his own. No Tarantino film would be complete without a good soundtrack. This one, as with Desperado, features songs by Tito and Tarantula. Although I have only heard four songs by them, I consider them one of my favorites. I will never forget what my parents told me after they watched this without me. ""You sure can pick 'em,"" my mother blurted with distain.

It's unbelievable.  Tarantino could write a good movie while in a coma, he's so talented.  The action is fun, the acting is solid, and the laughs range from amusing to downright hilarious.  This is EASILY the best action/horror movie that I've ever seen, and probably one of the ten best films I've seen of any genre, period.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Suffers from the FULL METAL JACKET-effect, where the first act easily tops the remaining two acts after taking a major turn in events to leave the audience feeling like they're watching an entirely different movie. Tarantino is never at his fullest potential when partnered with the skin-deep action-driven talents of Rodriguez. SFX absolutely amazing for 1996, though; and a fun picture to revisit every seven or eight years. First appearance of Earl McGraw (Michael Parks).*** (out of four)",From Dusk Till Dawn
124,vostf,Teenage bad*ss heroes,3,14 July 2008,"You know the love of Quentin Tarantino for B-movies, even exploitation movies, so you can't expect too much from this one. Robert Rodriguez shoots it fine, although you can feel in the quiet moments, the 'quasi lulls', that it was not really his movie.What's very good in From Dusk Till Dawn is the dialog. Tarantino is definitely a master movie speech writer. He may steal from the ton of movies he has digested, he, the mad movie-hungry monster, he does it really fine, as a real connoisseur, not as a low-life grave-digger.What's really bad in the movie? The sick violence meant to be entertaining. Rich Gecko is a sicko and Tarantino thinks he is being funny. It's horrendous to depict such a degree of realistic violence tongue in cheek. Seth Gecko is supposed to be cleaner, while no smarter, yet that doesn't even it out. If that's the way it was intended then Seth Gecko is a bad excuse for his brother's excesses. The part in the desert where the body count goes way up is much more gore than the exposition with the Gecko bros but it's only cheap teenage stuff. You may feel it's dull as I do, or enjoy it because you like cheap; the fact is: sick realistic violence in the beginning is not washed out by the funky carnage that makes the bulk of the movie.Ironically enough, the disturbing start was more interesting than the contrived party in the Mexican desert. The last shot was great though.",From Dusk Till Dawn
125,DarthVoorhees,Half a great movie,5,30 April 2011,"What we get with 'From Dusk til Dawn' is half a great movie and half a pretty conventional boring one. Don't get me wrong I love me a good vampire film but these vampires aren't very interesting at all. What is interesting is the heist and hostage plot at the beginning of the film that suddenly derails into a merely okay vampire film.I think there are moments in the first half of the film that match some of the great Tarantino moments. I love the black humor in the relationship between Seth and Richie. They are genuinely very interesting characters who are kind of repulsive but you can't help but be interested in them. The first twenty minutes of the film are brilliantly constructed. The liquor store scene is thrilling, suspenseful, and yet very funny at the same time. But what is even more interesting is the time spent at the motel. I love the scene where Richie interacts with the hostage as we know something terrible is about to happen to her but in typical Tarantino fashion he invites her to indulge on the TV with him. The Keitel plot line is seamlessly translated into this. I genuinely like his character and the interactions between him and the Gecko brothers are brilliantly played out. Keitel has a conversation with Clooney's Gecko about religion and faith at the wheel of a hideous RV which is fascinating and deep but is played through Tarantino wit. I was hooked. There is genuinely a very interesting take on religious themes with the Jacob character. Putting a religious man in Tarantino's world is just really bizarre and really fun and yet the dialogue doesn't make fun of the weight of this character. There's a tragic quality to him. Keitel gives a great performance.And as our characters reach the Mexican border things get less interesting. Vampires come from literally out of nowhere. Wow and I found myself saying just as this thing was getting good. Of course I knew the film was about vampires going in but I was hoping that it would continue through this lens. These vampires pop up out of nowhere and waste no time rampaging through everything totally putting whatever character development that was established to rest through gore. I like vampires I do but these vampires aren't interesting or scary. They aren't charismatic or sexy and they don't even talk. The make up design for them is cartoonish. It just isn't interesting at all. I've seen this done thousands of times before and it just is dumb because I don't see anything resembling a point happening here. And forget Tarantino's dialogue because once these vampires show up the only type of lines you'll be hearing are ""Stake him!"", ""I've been bite"", ""Bloodsuckers"" and that sort of thing. The thing that frustrated me most was seeing Keitels character in vampire make-up because he looks absolutely ridiculous. In a way that symbolized what I felt about the film. It could have been great if it stuck with the first part of the story but that RV made a wrong turn into stupidity.",From Dusk Till Dawn

The thing that saves this film is great dialogue due to a screenplay supplied by costar Tarantino. The direction is pretty good although it wasn't always interesting. Keitel is good in his role, as well as Clooney who gives one of his better performances. Tarantino was horrible in his acting, but Juliette Lewis was refreshing, as were supporting actors Marin and Trejo who are favorites of mine from other rodriguez flicks (marin from cheech and chong).

127,gigan-92,One of the Funnest Horrorr Films Out there,9,16 December 2010,"From the creative minds of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino comes this odd flick. I stumbled across it on TV and was fairly intrigued so I watched the encore presentation. I was actually pretty thrilled by it. The movie starts off with the guise of a genuine Tarantino flick, with great dialogue and the tense atmosphere of a tense crime thriller you could say. With acting presence of George Clooney, Tarantino himself, Harvey Keitel, and Juliette Lewis, it flows quite nicely. Plus, f*ckin Tom Savini!!! Film scholars and fans of horror will nod their heads in agreement. Then enter the lusciously delicious Salma Hayek, and from then on you are thrust into an entirely different film. It's this transition I believe that throws many off, but it works due to the performances and the thrill of the action.The film loses its sense of seriousness to a degree, but it serves up quite a bit of bloody, gruesome yet funny action. For what it is, the film is very entertaining and very different from what you usually get. I was excited to hear there were two sequels, but they're as dismal as the usual trash. ""From Dusk till Dawn"" is a truly unique horror experience.",From Dusk Till Dawn
128,moviesleuth2,B-movie leaves something to be desired,6,11 March 2010,"Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez are Hollywood's bad boys. The two of them completely flaunt Hollywood conventions, doing what pretty much whatever they want. The two filmmakers have very similar styles, and a co-operative production between the two became inevitable. Unfortunately, their first combined effort is something of a disappointment.Two bank robbing brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gekko (QT himself) are fleeing to Mexico to live a life of luxury. Along the way, they hijack an RV driven by Jacob Fuller, an ex-priest, and his son (Ernest Liu) and daughter (Juliette Lewis). Stopping to meet up with their cohorts at a bar, they discover that the bar is actually run by a group of nasty vampires.The problem with the film is that it takes a while to get going. Clooney is fun to watch, but this isn't the likable criminal that he usually plays. He's a violent thug, and ""charm"" is not something one would use to describe his character. QT however, is ineffective as Richard. He can be a genius filmmaker when he wants to be, but he can't act. Harvey Keitel is solid as the priest who lost his faith. Juliette Lewis is miscast, and the less said about Ernest Liu, the better (he's awful, if you must know).Robert Rodriguez is trying to emulate the B-grade zombie/vampire horror shlock films that he and QT love, and while it's certainly bloody, cheesy and sleazy, it's also a little boring. When the film gets going, it doesn't stop until the end. But it takes a little too long to get there.",From Dusk Till Dawn

I enjoyed this movie because I am a film geek, but I think other people will think it childish and badly put together.",From Dusk Till Dawn
130,dr_foreman,Every hack in Hollywood contributed to this disaster,1,24 March 2004,"*some spoilers follow*Looking back over my reviews, I see that I have a somewhat inconsistent reaction to violence. Maybe not inconsistent, but complicated. In general, I'm bothered by ""funny"" or glorified violence, and ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"" wallows in both. From the moment that the ""heroes"" set fire to a convenience store clerk, they lose all of my sympathy. They're every bit as repulsive as the vampires - so who cares if they win or lose? An essential element of horror is that the victims should be likable, so we can be alarmed at the prospect of their deaths; here, they're a bunch of jerks.The film could still be good, if viewed on an entirely superficial level, but it's not. Rodriguez's over-the-top action just looks tacky. The CGI effects are already ludicrous, the vampire makeups are silly (rubberized demons - what is this, a BBC production?), and the violence is neither exciting nor scary - it's merely gross.Check the trivia section and note that Quentin Tarantino - that fiercely original screenwriter and director - ripped off all of the film's best lines from older movies. I guess it was too much effort to come up with an original script, right? Of course, the siege aspect of the story comes right out of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and about 10,000 other horror films. At least Sex Machine acknowledges one debt - the improvised cross is lifted from Peter Cushing's ""Horror of Dracula,"" a film that's superior to this pile of crap in virtually every respect.This is horror for the stupid set, a movie where the coolest thing in evidence is a ""crotch cannon."" It's SO mindless that I can't even appreciate it on the same level as bad Godzilla; it's TRYING to be campy and stupid, but at the same time masquerading as a piece of decent film art created by famous people, and it's that clash of styles that bothers me so. This film is dishonest. It's a turd wrapped in silk. It thumbs its nose at horror while trying to horrify. In short, it's maybe the worst film I've ever seen...and I've had to sit through it twice! Do I get some kind of endurance award for that?",From Dusk Till Dawn
131,LoneWolfAndCub,An action-packed extravaganza!!,7,17 August 2006,"From Dusk Till Dawn is simply a fun movie. Not meant to be taken seriously at all. If you're looking for a movie to sit back and enjoy for brainless entertainment, get this. There is nothing wrong with the acting, the music really good and the special effects are gross (but great).The first half of the story revolves around the Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino). They need to get past the Mexican border to a bar named the ""Titty Twister."" Along the way they take hostage the Fuller family, Jacob (Harvey Keital), Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). In the second part of the movie they make it to the bar, unfortunately it is a bar run by vampires and soon enough the feasting begins.This movie is great in a lot of ways. First, the script is written brilliant, it is darkly humorous. A lot of the lines had be laughing very hard. The acting is good from all the cast and the special effects are pretty disgusting. We have decapitations, limbs getting torn off, throats getting ripped out and plenty of impalements. For gore hounds, this movie is gold. This movie never really gets boring.

132,Antagonisten,Two in one,7,27 April 2005,"This movie can be seen in two ways i guess. The first way is to see it and not think, in which case you can just look at it as an entertaining vampire-flick. The other way to look at it is to think a little and realize that this is really two movies in one.The movie starts out quite slow and somber. Two brothers are on the run from the law, having broken out of prison and leaving a trail of dead police officers behind them. They are heading toward the Mexican border at top speed. Their paths cross with a family consisting of a father and his two children. Thinking that it would be easier to cross the border in a motor home with a family the brothers take them hostage.For about half the movie this is not so different from what you would expect from Tarantino. Some quite funny dialog, George Clooney as the foul-mouthed hard-case. And Harvey Keitel as the world-weary preacher being taken hostage. Then the other half of the movie changes style completely. From a rather comfy thriller of sorts it erupts into a splatter-filled vampire-flick. And i guess this is where many people start having trouble with this movie.However, i must confess i really like this movie. In forging these two styles together Robert Rodriguez shows that he has the fingertip-feel needed to balance them out. While there is certainly a lot of gore the comedy never leaves the movie. I found myself sitting with a more or less constant smile on my face throughout. Sometimes, in very rare cases, the sum of the parts are bigger than the whole so to speak. And this is such a case. I rate this 7/10.",From Dusk Till Dawn
133,elicopperman,Action packed Horror Extravaganza Across the Border,6,1 August 2021,"In his early days, groundbreaking low budget filmmaker/vfx artist Robert Rodriguez started off making experimental action films with little to no money, or even crew, including his smash directorial debut El Mariachi. Thanks to his longtime friendship with Quentin Tarantino and their now defunct company A Band Apart, which produced Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction among many others, they were able to collaborate on many bizarre concoctions. One notable example is From Dusk till Dawn, a gritty action horror film that's initial success led to a whole franchise. So after 25 years of being in the limelight, how does it hold up?The movie focuses on the American criminal Gecko brothers (played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) who take the Fuller family as hostages (played by Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) in order to cross into Mexico. Throughout the first half of the movie, all of the stakes are around this odd duo, who are trying to pull themselves together in an attempt to sneak across the Mexican border despite killing people along the way. In addition to Quentin Tarantino's snappy dialogue in the screenplay, the movie is carried by the conflicting personalities from the Gecko brothers, and one can tell how much they do care for each other despite being overly stubborn and arrogant just to get to their specific destination. Even the Fullers, who are obviously taken under their own will, end up reluctantly developing through their circumstances, including Jacob Fuller (Keitel) going through somewhat of a spiritual redemption arc throughout the course of the film. Even through all of these stakes laid on top of all our protagonists, there is a lot to take in from them that makes this journey worth checking out.However, once they finally do meet their destination, it ends up becoming more than meets the eye. After dusk closes in, all of our protagonists become trapped inside a saloon frequented by vampires. While this would seem almost completely out of place for a movie like this, this is what ends up becoming the fate of most of our protagonists, and Fuller's spiritual arc ends up concluding in an attempt to sacrifice himself to the vampire army while taking them out one at a time. In addition, the film's conceiver Robert Kurtzman is a well renowned visual effects and makeup artist, having years of experience on creepy horror films of the 1980s onward, so the effects of the vampires themselves look incredible for a small high budgeted feature like this. The actual makeup and puppetry of the monsters are appropriately grotesque, but the transitions between their humanlike counterparts are what sell their creep factor, including Salma Hayek going from an erotic bar dancer to a hideous vampire who will take over anyone as their slave. It's not everyday when the effects make up the second half of a movie.Now with all of this mentioned, one make or break deal with the entire movie is how overly violent the second half becomes, to a point where the bloodshed and defensive stabbings of ravenous vampires becomes almost tiresome. Not helped by how uneven the film becomes trying to balance out more characters that slowly descend into vampires themselves, the pacing can often come to a halt whenever we go from action set piece to continuous mayhem. As a result, the film ends up having to compromise character development just so we can get through all of the action packed extravaganza. So while it may appeal more to gory slasher movie fans than the average movie goer, it does ultimately come at a price of one's own judgement in the end. Besides, one can tell how much fun Rodriguez, Tarantino, Kurtzman and the cast were having on set, even if what they were making was a bit too excessive. Then again, considering how the film wraps up, one will end up thinking about the possibilities such a location of a bar could end up leading towards.So while it may be a bit too self indulgent for its own good, there's no denying how much of a pulpy wild ride From Dusk till Dawn truly is. Thanks to the well coordinated collaborations between Rodriguez, Tarantino, Kurtzman and more, fans of their work have ended up with a deliriously entertaining cult film of their own for years on end. If you've yet to check out this feature yourself or if you're into excessive shock fests disguised as horror movies, then this should be right up your alley. Besides, it's probably way more interesting than whatever mainstream fodder Rodriguez is cranking out nowadays.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Seth is the play-it-cool and older brother while Richie has his own psychopathic thoughts; and in the film's prologue, Richie shoots a deputy for no reason, but assumes that the clerk ratted them out.As they are on the run, The Gecko Brothers have a female bank teller hostage in the back of their trunk and later while Seth is gone, Richie rapes her and makes up an excuse for why he killed her.After Richie screws up the plan, knowing that they might get caught, Seth decides to take action and force a minister named Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and his children Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) to take them to Mexico, or else they'll be executed one by one.Jacob takes his RV with the kids and the Gecko Brothers where they make it across the border and go to a strip bar where Seth and Richie have to meet some associates.

It stars the very elite of badass cinema--George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis. The two former play brothers and partners in crime on their way to Mexico for a big business rendez-vous and on their way they take a family of three hostage in order to get a ride there. You may think you have the good taste not to enjoy something as silly as its premise, but as far as horror films go, this is quality. Harcore quality.I will tell you what makes From Dusk Till Dawn awesome and what sets it apart from other films. The first half of the movie looks like it's taking the form of a hostage drama and you're left thinking that it will probably culminate in a couple of murders once the brothers reach their destination in Mexico. This part is very nicely handled as it builds up tension in the plot and at the same time has this barren Western feeling as the vehicle swooshes through the desert. The dialogue is very Tarantinoesque (he wrote it, after all). Then, as they reach their rendez-vous point they enter a titty bar somewhere in Mexico. Only, this isn't your average shady strip-club but it is stock-full of vampires at night. God, this part is so random. So what starts off as a hostage drama suddenly turns into a full-on war against vampires, with the family and brothers left fending for themselves against these awful creatures all night long.From Dusk Till Dawn is foul-mouthed, gory, brutal, funny and extremely unpredictable.

It starts off as one film, then changes track, cheating us of a resolution to that film and ends as another movie which is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other schlock-horror flicks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of hubris. Screenplay by Tarantino, direction by Rodriguez, two guys who have previously shown talent, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that whatever they do must be good merely because THEY did it. But it doesn't quite work that way. You're only good while you continue doing good things. There are so many questions to ask: Just what are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel doing getting involved in such pointless dreck? Clooney initially makes an intriguing bad guy  utterly ruthless and efficient  and it would have been interesting to see where that was going. But, of course, we never do. And the Clooney of the vampire film changes into a completely different character. That's not clever or witty, that's just bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill at ease throughout, and no wonder. Did no one in the studio take a look at the script before this project was given the go-ahead?

146,emperor_bender,"Starts off like a Tarantino film, but becomes a Rodriguez movie",9,2 March 2008,"This was a very unique movie. Yes I say that a lot, but its true. Especially with From Dusk til Dawn. Tarantino and Rodriguez always make great films together, and this was no exception. The film starts off in a basic ""Tarantino Movie"" sense that is seen and felt in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. However, it quickly becomes a Rodriguez film in the blink of an eye, and it has the ""Rodriguez Movie"" feel that his other films have. The actors which appear here are seen in many other Tarantino and Rodriguez movies. From Tarantino's films, we have: Harvey Keitel (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction), Michael Parks (Kill Bill, Death Proof), small parts such as Lawrence Bender (Producer in a lot of Tarantino films) even Tarantino himself. And from Rodriguez's movies we have: George Clooney (Spy Kids), Cheech Martin (Spy Kids, Planet Terror), Danny Trejo (Spy Kids, Planet Terror), even Tom Savini (automatically makes this movie awesome). This was a great combination of directing and story. The characters here were all very memorable and were given a great story to work with. Many will argue that this movie is very violent and gory, well, aside from Spy Kids, all of Rodriguez's films are violent, mindless, and very cold at times (see Planet Terror or Sin City if you want an example). Yet this movie was underrated for it. Only a 6.9 while Planet Terror got a 7.7 and Sin City got an 8.4 (all ratings as of 3/2/08). I guess people were expecting a Tarantino movie like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs and were unhappy when they saw what type of movie this was. I thought it was great. Harvey Keitel was very good. George Clooney was surprisingly the best actor here. Tarantino played a very good psycho also. Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu were also very good. My man Tom Savini was great as Sex Machine (I love the gun trick he uses). Fred Williamson was also good as Frost. Cheech Marin was good in all 3 parts he played, Danny Trejo and Salma Hayek were great. There were no bad performances as far as I could tell. This was a good movie and deserves the same respect as movies like Sin City, Reservoir Dogs, and all of those. 9/10 seems like a good rating for this movie but just isn't what everyone else agrees with. See this movie if you are a Rodriguez movie fan, you will enjoy it.",From Dusk Till Dawn
147,Gafke,"Insane, Gory Fun",8,17 April 2004,"This is a wild, crazed, demented, sick, loud, gore-splattered, profanity-laden, explosion-heavy, hot and sexy vampire film. It's also a lot of fun if you can stomach all the previously mentioned elements.Seth and Richard Gecko (played by George Clooney and the amazing Quentin Tarantino) are fugitives on their way to Mexico amid a storm of bullets and fire. After hijacking a motor home and the nice family it belongs to (jaded ex-minister Harvey Keitel, daughter Juliette Lewis and son Ernest Liu) the strange group is heading for a notorious Mexican strip joint called The Titty Twister. Unfortunately, the group has no way of knowing that the bar is staffed by some really nasty vampires.Some of my favorite people are in this odd little flick: the aforementioned Tarantino (who has never done anything that I don't like), the amazing Keitel (totally cast against type here and doing an amazing job as always), the smolderingly beautiful Salma Hayek, playing the sinuously sexy dancing vampire Satanica Pandemonium, and Cheech Marin, who actually has three roles in this movie but who stands out as the doorman of the Titty Twister, enthusiastically announcing all the varieties of, um, women and their sexual organs to be found within. It's absolutely hysterical...but only if you're not easily offended by the common nickname for house cats being used to describe the female genitalia. Quentin Tarantino also does an outstanding job in his role as the delusional Richard, who imagines he hears crude come-ons from any and every woman he spends too much time around. Keep an eye out for early evidence of his now notorious foot fetish in the scene he shares with Salma, her white snake (nice Bram Stoker touch, by the way) and her bare feet. The violence is explosive and virtually non stop by the third act. The make-up effects by Tom Savini (who also has a role as a biker named Sex Machine) are pretty damn cool, but as with every film that Tarantino has touched, the real action lies within the words spoken by the actors. The script is fast and clever and as incredibly funny as it is offensively sick. This is half vampire film, half Spaghetti western with a little Reservoir Dogs thrown in for good measure. And it's really damn fun too. Fans of Tarantino should enjoy this, and vampire fans tired of the same old formulaic films might just enjoy this odd side road into new territory. The easily offended should stay far away. The rest of us without an ounce of PC will be laughing our tasteless butts off.",From Dusk Till Dawn
148,skybrick736,From Dusk Till Dawn (9/10),9,29 August 2015,"Loaded with kick-ass actors and actress with the likes of George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek and Quentin Tarantino there is little doubt that this movie was going to be a bust. The film starts out as a gruesome dramatic action but tailspins into an all-out bloody vampire flick. Given the horror element of vampires, Robert Rodriquez casted a few well-known supporting actors (Danny Trejo, Tom Savini and John Saxon) to solidify his horror film and attract audiences. There are an abundance of quotable, laughable lines throughout that is only in Rodriquez and Tarantino type fashion. The film is a wild ride, with a load of bullets and exploding corpses. The one let down from this being perfect is the awful CGI but that can be looked past. From Dusk Till Dawn isn't the traditional vampire flick but it does offer a whole helluva a lot, a fantastic flick to put up your feet and kick back to.",From Dusk Till Dawn
149,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,1 December 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!When you take two of the most witty and talented directors of the decade and let them play with vampires, gangsters and cowboys, the outcome is always going to be interesting at the very least. FDTD manges to be more though, delivering more of what made each director popular in the first place- great dialogue and originality. A movie with a dedicated group of hardcore fans, though i'm sure the same can be said for any movie, it blends genres seamlessly, almost like Audition, fooling the viewer into expecting another run of the mill gangster film. The film features many good ideas, not all of which come off, and is so far the closest Tarantino has come to making his version of Rio Bravo. Great ideas, good script, good acting and direction, and some nice effects, again questioning the necessity for over-abundant CGI. It perhaps could have been a little longer, especially the Titty Twister section, with further development between the surviving characters, but maybe that would have changed the style and tone of the movie. For blood and banter, movies don't come much better than this. 8 out of 10",From Dusk Till Dawn
150,thomasjay-2201,Entertaining Ride,7,28 July 2018,"A fast paced and non stop film 'From dusk till dawn' is a pleasant surprise, packed with an all star cast the story unfolds at a breakneck speed and is extremely entertaining as the characters play off of each other and develop over the runtime. A film no too dissimilar to the Evil Dead franchise this horror/action/comedy is a good watch",From Dusk Till Dawn
151,bh_tafe3,Not what many expected,7,19 July 2014,"I remember watching this with a friend who told me after the film, she was loving it until they went to Road House, at which point it turned into the worst movie ever made.Maybe it was my love of horror movies, maybe it was my teenage Salma Hayek lust going into overdrive, who knows? But I absolutely loved it from start to finish. However, my friend, Jenny made a good point about this film: it starts off as one type of movie and then morphs into something completely different. Often with a film you can get a pretty good feel for what you are watching in the first 15-20 minutes and have a reasonably good idea if you are going to enjoy it or not. This is one film where you can love the first 45 minutes and despise the rest of the film, or vice versa.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino star as the Grecko Brothers who, after an amusing opening sequence where they rob a liquor store, are on the run from the police and end up taking a retired Priest Jake Fuller and his two children (one of whom is Juliette Lewis fresh off of Natural Born Killers) hostage as they head to Mexico to meet their friend Carlos (one of many roles in the movie played by Cheech Marin). Upon arrival The Greckos are given quite a show by a stripper (Salma Hayek) who feeds Tarantino some champagne down her leg.That's where it gets pretty different, as they turn out to be in a vampire bar and Clooney spends the rest of the movie fighting creatures of darkness, before an amusing final scene with Cheech.This was my second look at a Robert Rodriguez movie following Desperado, and as well as recurring cast members (Tarantino, Hayek, Marin, Danny Trejo) and setting (Mexico) this one also has a very similar feel.The film delivers something rather different from what you'd expect from the premise and is actually a pretty good kick ass action flick made with typical Rodriguez oddness. The cast are all stellar and it is great watching Clooney and Keitel together.It's no Desperado by any means, but From Dusk Til Dawn is a satisfying action thriller and one of Rodriguez's better films.",From Dusk Till Dawn
152,DigitalRevenantX7,Two mediocre films for the price of one.,4,4 June 2008,"The Story: Seth & Richard Gecko, two violent criminals on the run from the law, kidnap an ex-minister & his children in order to escape into Mexico. While waiting for a contact at the Titty Twister, a dusk-till-dawn bar for truckers & bikers, they are attacked by an army of vampires & must fight till dawn to survive.It's not often you get to see two different directors (& good friends) combine their talents to make a genre film such as this. Working from an old script that Tarantino wrote when he was still a video store clerk, Rodriguez creates two different films for the price of one. The first 40 minutes consist of a fairly average getaway film. But instead of being hip, there is no wit in the dialogue, the acting is mediocre & the characterizations one-dimensional. Plus George Clooney's character tries to be likable but fails. Things get worse when the film changes once the characters reach the Titty Twister. The gore flies think & fast, along with credibility  the characters learn how to kill vampires in next to no time, yet later have a discussion on how to kill them. Fred Williamson's speech on how he decimated a Viet Cong squad is purely unnecessary. Tom Savini's biker Sex Machine wields a genital-shaped gun, one of the most stupid weapons ever designed & later turns into a huge rat for no reason at all. There is a lot of blood, but it has no real effect.Score: 4 out of 10",From Dusk Till Dawn
153,jamiedarlow-37510,"'Okay, ramblers.... Lets get rambling'",10,29 March 2020,"Absolutely amazing! Focusing on the Gecko brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) and the family they take hostage (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) travelling across the borders into Mexico to escape the authorities after a bank heist. It's one hell of a ride from start to finish including a massive plot twist half way through which, if you don't know anything about the film before going in, will blow your mind! A fantastically paced combination of crime thriller and horror, Rodriguez crafts a ridiculously fun and darkly sleazy tale while including riotously great action and gruesome gore. The performances are great; definately Tarantino's best role as the creepy and psychopathic Richard, sibling of Gordon who is similarly a career best from George Clooney. Gordon is threatening and unstable but also has an irresistible charm that makes the audience and family he kidnaps feel oddly comfortable around him. There are awesome cameos from Rodriguez's favourites Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin (in awfully but hilariously perverted form) and Salma Hayek; particular standout from Hayek in probably one of the sexiest and most badass dance sequences ever captured on film! The script by Tarantino is naturally witty, sharp and effortlessly cool. Rodriguez injects his trademark styles throughout including fantastically choreographed action and music sections, the best kind of cheesy dialogue deliveries and just the coolest of swaggering flair. An early demonstration of Rodriguez/Tarantino's partnership and their obsession with grindhouse movies, it's essential viewing and proper popcorn entertainment",From Dusk Till Dawn
154,coldwaterpdh,A little messy but so cool it doesn't matter.,8,15 November 2008,"Definitely paving the road that Tarantino should have gone down, ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" is one of my all time favorite movies. Amazingly badass opening scene. From there, the way the script flows is amazing; all the characters mesh well. Keitel, Liu and Lewis play a family kidnapped by Tarantino and Clooney (yes George Clooney) in a fantastic duo: the Gecko brothers, two criminals on the run to El Rey, Mexico. They rendezvous at an open-all-night nudie bar and it turns out to be a haven for vampires. Despite the fact that they are technically vamps, I still classify ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" as a zombie film. It's gory, it's violent it's funny and it's grimy.I can't believe George Clooney is so cool in this. Why he didn't make more films like this, one can only guess. He makes a great low-life, intelligent criminal. Also, I wish Richard was a bit more likable. Why Tarantino made that character such a sicko is beyond me.All in all an awesome horror flick that seems to never get old. I wish Quentin and Robert still made em like this! 8 out of 10, kids.",From Dusk Till Dawn
155,jcbutthead86,"One Of The Greatest Vampire Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Thrilling,Over The Top Action-Horror-Thriller Cult Classic From Robert Rodriguez And Quentin Tarantino.",10,15 December 2014,"From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the greatest vampire films ever made,an excellent and over the top Action-Horror-Thriller that combines terrific direction,a fantastic cast,a great script,a memorable score and soundtrack and outstanding special effects. All of those elements make From Dusk Till Dawn a Cult Classic that is Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino at their best.From Dusk Till Dawn tells the story of criminals and brothers Seth(George Clooney)and Richie Gecko(Quentin Tarantino)who are on the run from the cops and have to get across the border to Mexico with their hostages Jacob Fuller(Harvey Keitel)and his kids Kate(Juliette Lewis)and Scott(Ernest Liu). When the Geckos and the Fullers arrive in Mexico they go into a bar called the Titty Twister which is filled with bloodsucking Vampires. Now,The Geckos and Fullers have to fight the Vampires and stay alive.From Dusk Till Dawn is a brilliant and memorable Action-Horror-Thriller that was a collaboration between film directors and best friends Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino(who wrote the screenplay). Together Rodriguez and Tarantino combined their respective talents and crafted one of the best Vampire films of all-time and is a film that spawned a Television show and two Direct-to-DVD sequels and is a Cult Classic from the moment you watch it. From Dusk Till Dawn is a terrific and truly unforgettable genre film that is like a gigantic fireball that hits you in the face right from the start and has an intensity that never stops until the very end. From Dusk Till Dawn is a film that embraces it's B-movie roots giving the audience a bloody,gory and over the top Vampire movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and basically tells the viewers to have a good time giving viewers a Grindhouse movie that throws in everything but the kitchen sink giving us a Horror movie,Action film,Crime Drama and Western all in one with a dark Comedic style. One of the things that I have always enjoyed about FDTD and one of the reasons it stands out from other Vampire flicks is the way the movie is structured. The first half of the film is more like a Crime Drama focusing on the Geckos and the Fullers and the efforts to try to get to Mexico with mostly dialog getting viewers to know the main characters who are interesting and have depth. It's very much like a Quentin Tarantino film. The second half of the film is just pure Action-Horror and is very much like a Robert Rodriguez film because it is filled with Vampires,blood,guts and carnage all around with tons of excitement and chaos. The dialog and character driven style of Tarantino and the wild over the top Action of Rodriguez go together well with nothing feeling uneven or mismatched. And Speaking of dialog,the screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is wonderful with memorable dialog that is well-written and interesting. And while the dialog in FDTD isn't iconic or fresh like Tarantino's other efforts it's still a great screenplay with terrific lines. The Vampires in FDTD are ugly,vicious and brutal and are not the kind of Vampires you want to be friends with because when they attack a human the Vampires tear a person to shreds. These Vampires in FDTD are not the romantic type but are ugly and disgusting creatures who at the drop of a hat(or in this case a drop of human blood)will kill anyone with a heartbeat and suck the blood out you. The blood and gore in FDTD disgusting and comes out like water and truly feels like a Splatter movie. The Action is explosive,fiery and fast and will have viewers on the edge of their seat because the Action comes you never know what's going to happen or when. The Action scenes in FDTD are Robert Rodriguez at the top of his game. The ending of From Dusk Till Dawn is amazing and filled with tons of Action and gore that is filled with tons of chaos and mayhem that perfectly goes with the rest of the film. A terrific and memorable conclusion.The cast is wonderful. George Clooney is excellent and at his best as Seth Gecko,with Clooney being charismatic and cool. Harvey Kietel is terrific as Jacob Fuller,a preacher. Quentin Tarantino is outrageous and memorable as Richie Gecko,Seth's mentally unstable brother. Juliette Lewis is fantastic as Kate Fuller,Jacob's daughter. Ernest Liu does a good job as Scott,Jacob's son. Salma Hayek is outstanding and sexy as Santacio Pandemonium,an exotic dancer. Cheech Marin is incredible in his trio of roles(Border Guard,Chet Pussy,Carlos). Tom Savini(Sex Machine)and Fred Williamson(Frost)do great jobs as guys that the help the Geckos and Fullers against the Vampires. Danny Trejo(Razor Charlie),Michael Parks(Texas Ranger Earl McGraw),John Hawkes(Pete Bottoms,Liquor Store Clerk),John Saxon(FBI Agent Stanley Chase),Marc Lawrence(Old Timer Motel Owner),Kelly Preston(Newscastor Kelly Houge)and Brenda Hillhouse(Hostage Gloria Hillhouse)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Rodriquez is terrific with Rodriguez always moving the camera and giving the movie a stylish look with zooms,close-up as well as high and low angles while doing a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful job,Rodriguez.The score by Greame Revell is great,intense and fits with the tone of the movie. Fine score,Revell. There is also a great soundtrack with songs by The Blasters(Dark Night),ZZ Top and Tito And Tarantula. Cool soundtrack.The Special Make-Up and Practical Effects by the always great K.N.B EFX Group is amazing as always with make-up effects that add to the film. Terrific job once again,K.N.B.In final word,if you love Robert Rodriguez,Quentin Tarantino,Vampire movies,Horror Films or Action movies,I highly suggest you see From Dusk Till Dawn,one of the greatest Vampire movies ever made and an excellent Action-Horror-Thriller Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",From Dusk Till Dawn
156,GeorgeRoots,Well.. The Name Of The Bar Made Me Chuckle.,8,16 November 2013,"I truly adore this weird little piece of drive-through exploitation cinema. The first movie to mix the creative camera work of Robert Rodriguez, as well as the writing and ""acting"" talent of Quentin Tarantino. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" begins serious in tone, then suddenly B-Movie madness shines all throughout the remaining half.Based on the notorious ""Grindhouse"" movie boom of the 1970's, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play two criminal brothers escaping from the law to Mexico. Along the way they kidnap a family trio (The father is the superb Harvey Keitel), and while waiting for the cartel they hide out in a sleazy strip joint appropriately named the ""Titty-Twister"". It's stupid and dumb, but that's what's so damn enjoyable about it. Robert & Quentin have literally created a fantastic ""leave your brain at the door"" movie, and re-created that B-movie vibe with quite an ensemble cast (Most notably Tom Savini as hilarious biker ""Sex-Machine""). Overall it's a fun movie with guns, over the top gore and one liners that all echo Rodriguez's ""El Mariachi"" movies. And when mashed together with Quentin's quick witted dialogue and humour, what more could you ask for? Final Verdict: If you liked Tarantino/Rodriguez's recent ""Grindhouse"" Double-Feature, then you should love this. I've seen it so many times now and damn is it re-watchable. 8/10.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Man, we could have a new ""Desperado"", we cold have another gun-slinger jewel from Robert Rodriguez. But this isn't so. Because of half an hour of disappointment. I will just say this, the movie is truly great until they get into that damn bar. Then it's just downhill, and I wonder why script-writer Tarantino did it like so. Because the movie is too cool from the start. Brothers Seth and Richie Gecko are famous bank-robbers and are on the run. They are responsible for a truck-load of deaths, and they have to escape. They choose the family of priest Jacob Fuller to accomplish it. The showcase of Tarantinian trademark dialogue is genius, with many fantastic dialogue to show in the respective quote section. As I said before, the movie is really a great movie until they get to that bar, where all hell breaks loose (literally). The makers of this movie should really have a fetish for B-Movies, since all I can say is that they really made it like so, and I am talking about everything, even the special effects. You'll see for yourself, but you are warned: when they cross that door, the movie gets really B-Grade, and never recovers.

(back in the day Marlene Dietrich could pull this off in black and white films till she was 62...however find those pictures accurately colorized you can see tape and she looks like a clown). In terms of ""Breast enlargement"" 25% of menopausal women's breasts get larger however only in relation to the rest of the body and is mostly fat tissue. So when she says ""I can't explain they keep getting bigger and bigger"" and example can be seen in 95-05 Sigourney Weaver, compared to Alien and Aliens. So Selma Hayek can say day and night she hasn't had breast augmentation she either has a magic wonder bra...or a pump since always and her chest is like the tire on a bike. Seeing many pictures she has filled out more all over, she likely had a breast lift if not implants. And her face definitely slight Botox and makeup, I don't see any lip injection or indication of surgery.

The best excellent action horror 90's insanlly entertaining movie from director Robert Rodriguez and writter Quentin Tarantino. In my opinion it is their best film, I love this film to death. I am huge fan of this movie. This and Fright Night (1985) are my favorite vampire films but From Dusk Till Dawn is my number 1 favorite Vampire film of all time it is above Fright Night (1985).""Welcome to slavery, No, thanks. I've already had a wife.""I like Robert Rodriguez: Not Hughe fan of El Mariachi, but I love Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico with Johnny Depp, I would say those two are great films he directed. The Faculty I like a lot, i watch it as a teen on VHS have not seen the movie in a while, but a good sci-fi horror movie of the 90's. Quentin Tarantino his movies I like Kill Bill: Vol. , Jackie Brown was okay movie and Pulp Fiction I really love, I have not seen that movie in a long time. I love Rodriguez and Tarantino this is my favorite film they ever did together, my all time favorite. Quentin Tarantino wrote the script and acted, he did a great job I love his character Richard Gecko. My favorite George Clooney film as Seth Gecko the best one he ever did. I like The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman, I don't mind him in that film. Clooney never played a character as cool like this one again. Three years ago was 20th anniversary, this film come out in 1996 in which that time was a hit.The film was wery well written it has great cast: George Clooney,
Juliette Lewis, Quentin Tarantino does a fine as Richie Gecko brother of the brothers Gecko famous bank robbers. You have Harvey Keitel as a preacher, who lost his wife and has 2 kids one of them is Juliette Lewis. Cheech Marin is in three roles which is fun. Danny Trejo is in here I think he was in all three From Dusk Till Dawn movies. You have Fred Williamson which I love his character Frost, he is Vietnam Vet he was in Vietnam 1972, he killed single handly all VC platoon. We have Tom Savini who is a horror master in FX effects as Sex Machine. Kelly Preston, Salma Hayek, John Saxon and Michael Parks are in here really excellent cast.The first hour has characters arc build which it works still today. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the bad guys. They are not the good guys in here, they are not bank robbers with heart of gold, they are bad boys and they will kill you for real. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are in this bar Titty Twister and vampires appear and Clooney, Tom Savini, Fred Willamson are killing all those vampires. You have table of four legs and Fred Williamson pins them all. Tom Savini stakes Danny Trejo in a bad-ass scene. I love those Vampires, I love the effects how they look. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel are fighting vampires who are attacking them. Ghoulies and zombie typs love the effects. George Clooney has Jack Hammer with a stake and he kills the vampires. Harvey Keitel has a shotgun with a cross and shoots the vampires. Juliette Lewis has crossbow, she shots with arrows the vampires, she is a bad-ass. I love the actress to death.The score is well done, I absolutelly love the soundtrack: Dark Night by The Blasters such a cool song love the soundtrack to death. I am going to gave that song in my cell phone. I love She's Just Killing Me by ZZ Top those 2 soundtracks are cool. I really love those cool songs this movie has.Great dialogue in the film, I love George Clooney I love his character, he is an anti-hero, he is a lead guy in here, I like him and he does a great job. The action is well done. It is Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. It has gore, lots of bodys, great kills, bad-ass film. We have little action in the store in the open scene. Great well done practical effects, no CGI effects in here, great flamable explosion and epic finale. This movie with Aliens (1986), Levithan (1989), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood (1988) is my personal favorite horror monster film of all time.

The opening to this movie rivals Pulp Fiction as some of the coolest work the man has done. Yes, Rodriguez directed, but Tarantino wrote and acted, and I consider this to fully be his movie. Every Rodriguez film where Tarantino had no major influence has totally sucked and been a bore-fest.The first half is awesome Pulp Fiction-ish stuff, but once they get to the Titty Twister it turns to awesome 30 Days of Night-ish stuff. The only problem I could find with either half was the creature effects were pretty outdated and really took away from the feel.With that said, the characters are completely believable and freaking fun. The plot is pure genius. I didn't even have to check the time for how long it had left even once, which is pretty much something I do with every movie. I wasn't bored for a second, and I get bored insanely easily.It's even better if you have no idea what is going to happen, and I highly suggest you watch it like that or have a friend watch it like that.

Really, really different. Basically it kind of turns into a horror movie. I loved it, and thought it was one of the best films I've ever seen. And, I can't wait to watch it again. I will however, not recommend this to anyone under the age of eighteen. It's pretty gruesome at times, and there's a lot of foul language, and graphic dialogue, not suitable for anyone under that age.But, for everyone else, check it out.

Although I do like Tarantino's style and sometimes Robert Rodriguez, I cannot credit From Dusk Till Dawn with anything. If I was entertained I would have awarded the film a higher rating, but since it was both flat and stupid it gets a very low score.The first act of the film until the characters enter the bar in Mexico is just watchable: How come I liked the first part better? I thought it might lead to something mildly interesting and the quick hitting humour from the Tarantino script was relatively enjoyable.On another note, I have to say that Quentin Tarantino's performance in this film is beyond awful (or is it because this is suppose to be a bad film, so the actors were advised to act badly?!!!) and he fully deserved his Razzie Nomination for 'Worst Supporting Actor'.Uninteresting, tedious cinema.2/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
168,willywants,Clever and off-beat but by no means a masterpiece,6,3 August 2005,"After going on a murderous killing spree, Two brothers, Seth and Richard, hide out with a family of hostages in a remote, seedy bar in Mexico. Unfortunately, the bar they picked happens to be run by blood-thirsty vampires, and if they want to escape, they will have to work with they're hostages to live through the night. I remember hearing a lot of hype about this film back when it first came out in 96', and even though I am a avid horror fan, I just got around to seeing the movie now. I honestly don't know what to think of this filmthe first half is a Quentin Tarantino-style crime romp, with his usual trademark sense of off-beat humor. Then the second half of the film: Blood, gore, monsters, blood, gore, monsters, more blood, gore, monstersI think you get the picture.It's certainly enjoyable and funny in that the characters, Tarantino's especially, are funny and likable, and the script, penned by Tarantino himself, is witty, clever and often imaginative. The actors all do a great job too; I loved Harvey Keitel's dead-pan delivery and Mr. Clooney is his usual sly self.Then, of course we have what the film was designed forthe gore and monsters. The boys at KNB effects deserve a pat on the back for they're contribution here. The creature effects were great and the gore was over-the-top but convincing and plentiful as hell. Unfortunately, this film was made during the digital boom so some pretty lame ""morphing"" effects were employed for the scenes where vampires melt after being killed, but this is only a small complaint.If you like gore or off-beat horror films, you'll probably enjoy this film, just remember to turn your brain off before watching it. On the whole it was pretty entertaining.6.5/10.",From Dusk Till Dawn

It's damn funny. And Seth cracks me up. I just don't like how hideous they made the vampires. I didn't like Richie much, so I'm glad he's gone.

It's one of those movies that need to be crappy in a certain way. All the vampires look really shitty. It just makes them gross, which is all part of the fun.While the TV show tells the audience a lot more about the whole thing and several people stay alive, the film also shares some of the strengths of the show. One of them how thrilling few scenes are, and you are not sure who to root for. To be honest, in the TV show there were more parties to root for than in the film, but still, same feeling.The cast of this film is really weird in a way. Clooney and Tarantino playing brothers? How would that ever be believable? Well, it seems alright, because the two work really well together. From Dusk Till Dawn is really messed up, but it is also so much fun, as Rodriguez' movies usually are. Excellent film, definitely has earned its cult status.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Home-free and troubles be damned, they party it up at a local strip joint that is open from dusk till dawn. In the morning, they will receive a generous pay-day, but in the meantime, must fend off a gang of deadly and sometimes seductive vampires.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a film about vampires, but you tend to forget about that in the first hour, as Tarantino's script focuses sharply on its characters. You'll feel like you're at the table with them as they share shots of whiskey, and when the excrement hits the fan, you're thrown off-balance by the complete 180 the film pulls. Now, depending on your expectations, the third act both ups the ante and makes the film, or it totally shatters the well-developed plot. If you love gore galore (hint: Robert Kurtzman, who provided special effects for the film, also conjured up the original story), this is your film. If anyone knows how to shoot a ""shoot 'em up"" flick, it's Robert Rodriguez, and he effortlessly transitions from character moments to over-the-top blood and guts and guns (check out Tom Savini's legendary gear) at the turn of a dime. Truly professional film-making is what we have here.Despite the fact that the film switches it up on you just as you settle in, the end results are so much fun that it's forgivable. If you can't enjoy vampires being jack-hammered with a giant wooden-stake, then this certainly isn't the movie for you. The film is whip-smart, at times hilarious and at others, sincere. It's also got a solid cast worth noting. George Clooney plays against type, and likewise, Tarantino is less annoying than he is in his other acting roles. Harvey Keitel more or less steals the show at times, as the most professional and likable of the bunch, but you'll get a kick, no doubt, in seeing Cheech Marin playing three, count 'em, three roles in the film. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is essentially a brilliant mash-up of Tarantino's unique story-telling and characters and Robert Rodriguez's signature action and effects sequences, most certainly foreshadowing the duo's epic collaboration, ""Grindhouse,"" a decade later.

175,kooleshwar,Would have made a Great B-Movie!!!,5,23 April 2006,"I am a proud lover of B-Movies or Lower A-movies. I love the quirky humour the old fashioned and lower quality special effects and the over exaggerated plot lines.I believe this movie is a cult classic and the only reason i can think off is that it is one of the cheesiest of movies these so called cult movie fans will ever see.It has all the makings of a classic B-Movie the quirky characters, the misplaced humour in the awkward situations, the humour in the fighting scenes etc etc.The movie does have the trademark styles of both Tarantino and Rodriguez though such as the Mexican setting and the untimely killings.The acting of the movie is top-notch and is probably the only thing that is not b-movie like as even the character artistes are not bad actors and often recognisable faces (check out the person in 3 different roles).Some of the characters especially the Sex-machine was hilarious.Also the music is good but then again its the best part of many b-movies.The pace of the movie moves along perfectly and its almost a shock (and a very pleasant one )even though you know that it has to happen when the fight with the vampires start.Which is where the worst and the best part of the movie is . I can see the humour, i can see the quirkiness but i can see why some parts especially the plot inconsistencies have to be so stupid.I've given this movie a low rating only because even though i enjoy b-movies i only watch them for free on TV and i paid good money on this one.If its coming on TV don't change the channel or better try getting the DVD(for free) from someone.",From Dusk Till Dawn
176,son_of_cheese_messiah,From bad till worse,1,25 August 2011,"One wonders if Tarantino wrote this script when he was 14 and just dusted it off. Everything about this movie -which is actually two bad stories stuck together to make one turkey- has an adolescent feel to it with its stylised and sadistic violence, gratuitous nudity, cliché ridden vampires, f-laden dialogue, gunplay, biker bars, girls on the toilet etc.Clooney and Tarantino play a couple of murderous brothers. Clooney is apparently the 'good' brother. He merely burns an innocent man alive, puts a gun to the heads of helpless women and children and shoots some bikers in cold blood. In what moral universe can such a character be considered a hero? The film makers seem to think so, since he is allowed to drive off into the sunset at the end, not just scot free by with a sexy young preacher's daughter hanging on his every word.Tarantino is the 'bad' brother. He improves on Clooney by shooting a ranger in the head point blank and raping and murdering an innocent abducted woman.These two then abduct Harvey Keitel and his son and daughter. Keitel is a cliché pastor who has lost his faith. Since Tarantino's gifts as a dialogue writer do not extend much beyond foul mouthed tirades (admittedly he does excel at that), this man of god and his young daughter are given the same f-bomb speech patterns as the 'heroes'.The first half of the movie is a deeply unpleasant series of indiscriminate murders, rapes and abductions. There is a brief satirical news report which is strangely out of place here, since the general atmosphere is menacing and aggressive.When they arrive in Mexico the film suddenly morphs into a poor vampire film. Two more formulaic characters appear out of nowhere, a cigar-chomping black man and a Mexican with a cannon codpiece. Together they fight an assortment of vampires as the film becomes campy and incoherent. The dialogue here, usually Tarantino's forte, is embarrassing. One could expect and even enjoy this sort of thing from a low budget movie, but one with Clooney and Tarantino in it? For supposedly top Hollywood talent, it is extraordinarily bad.",From Dusk Till Dawn
177,kingofdanerds,A blast from my childhood,8,12 November 2021,"There are certain movies that just stick with you. For me, one of the many movies that I remember watching in my childhood is From Dusk Till Dawn. I remember watching this for the first time on VHS, about 10 years after the film was released. From Dusk Till Dawn was released in 1996 and is produced, edited, and directed by Robert Rodriguez (Desperado and Planet Terror) and stars Harvey Keitel (Pulp Fiction and U-571), George Clooney (The Perfect Storm and Three Kings), Quentin Tarantino (who also wrote and produced this film, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs), and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers and August: Osage County). The film was a box office hit and received mixed but has had a huge cult following since release and since the release, the film has spawned two sequels and a TV series.Two criminal brothers known as the Gecko Brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino), kidnap a family and travel to Mexico to escape from the authorities. But they make a stop at a bar, whose attendants are not as all they seem.I forgot how fun this film is. From Dusk Till Dawn is two different films put into one. The first half plays out like a crime thriller and a very very good one too. It has all of the great and clever Tarantino written dialogue that you would want. Also has some good shoot outs that showcase some brutal violence. I am really interested in these characters. While both of the Gecko brothers are not good people, I some how really like Clooney's character. He plays the straight character opposite to Tarantino's creepy and unhinged character. While never being a huge fan of Tarantino's acting, he does a decent enough job here. Clooney excels and is pretty much what I remember most from this film is Clooney's character. After about halfway through the film, the film changes from an action thriller, to a fun and entertaining, balls to the wall craziness vampire movie. It is certainly a film that you could show someone and mess with them about it, taking in to consideration that they have not seen it yet. As a kid, I remember liking the second half better because I was more creeped out. But, as I grow wiser and more knowledgeable in film, I realize that I like the first half is my favorite. Literally, a film could be made of just the first half alone. The second half of the film comes a bit out of nowhere but I am still thoroughly entertained by it. We get some memorable side characters and we see some fantastic special effects from KNB on showcase here. Harvey Keitel, while being hardly noticeable as a priest and father who has lost faith, does another solid job here and I love that his character is given a nice and decent arc here. Even when the film switched from crime thriller to vampire movie, Tarantino's writing is still pretty great. One thing that has stuck with me through all these years is the soundtrack to this film. The song Dark Night by The Blasters is a song I strongly remember and hearing it again was a complete joy to me. So aside from the fact that, while entertaining as all hell, the vampire plot comes a bit out of nowhere, my only other negative is that I am at times a bit unsettled by the vulgarity of this film. Especially one scene where the p-word is said numerous, and I mean numerous, times in a row to a point that I was a bit taken out of the film because I had to basically say ""ok I get it"" and then return to the film. Other than that, I can't much complain.From Dusk Till Dawn is a fast paced part crime thriller, part vampire film that is loads of fun. Some might be turned away by the fact that this is essentially two films combined into one but I advise that one must keep an open mind about this film.",From Dusk Till Dawn

181,RhapsodyReviews,Adore this Film!,9,31 October 2019,"Review:
'From Dusk Till Dawn' is an action horror film directed by Robert Rodriguez.
This is just a fun filled movie from start to finish. It's by far one of my favorite George Clooney movies, and the story is so damn entertaining.
Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his younger brother Richard (Quentin Tarantino) are on the run after a bloody bank robbery in Texas. They escape across the border into Mexico and will be home-free the next morning, when they pay off the local kingpin. They just have to survive from dusk till dawn at the rendezvous point, which turns out to be a strip joint run by vampires.
The acting is very effective, with George Clooney carrying the film. Tarantino is average, but he was certainly having fun with the role. Keitel is terrific as always and is perfect as the faithless pastor who doesn't trust in God anymore. I was pretty impressed given the type of movie I was watching.
The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. The script is witty and full of dark humour, and the intro is certainly one of the best in movie history. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the straightforward bad guy, while Tarantino is his psychotic brother. You know exactly what your getting into with these characters. Rodriguez has always done films to have fun, and this is what has set him apart from other filmmakers.
Overall, this is another fun filled horror movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously and isn't afraid to be silly at times. It showed great characters with great actors portraying them. I totally recommend this movie to all vampire lovers.

And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house.The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well.The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained.

185,ryan_kuhn,Two Movies For the Price of One!,7,13 February 2005,"In ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", director Robert Rodriguez give us a Hitchcockian twist on the audience. The first hour of the movie is a heist film, as two brothers have robbed a bank and need to reach their contact in Mexico. The movie is suspenseful enough on it's own, as George Cloony and Quentin Tarantino (who also wrote the film) play the bank robbing brothers, Seth and Richard. They take a family hostage, lead by father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and children Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu), and use them to sneak into Mexico. That's when the movie changes from a heist thriller to a vampire scare-a-thon. The meeting point is a strip club where vampires run the show. You can almost hear Tarantino snicker in the background, wondering how he was able to get two of his favorite movie genres into one film. Tarantino also indulges in a passion, I'm sure, of his, as he licks whiskey off of Selma Hayek's toes (his reputation of having a foot fetish is well documented). I was really enjoying the heist aspect of the movie, but I suppose there wasn't enough there to fill entire movie, so the decision to go another way was a good one. The out of left field aspect of the vampire story is jarring and will surprise audiences who don't know it's coming (I guess that counts you out, as you've read this far). The blood and gore that does come from the vampire story is well done and does harken us back to the 1970s super-gory movies. Even Fred Williamson is in this movie. How much more B-movie can we get? There are lots of little jokes thrown throughout the movie, my favorite being Tom Savini's attempt to hide the fact changes are happening around him. The movie will entertain those who like both movie genres that are featured in From Dusk Till Dawn, but those who are squeamish about cursing, blood, guts, decapitations, vampires, or Cheech Marin, maybe this is not for you.",From Dusk Till Dawn
186,MF210,Solid Entertainment,8,22 August 2004,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Not every film that has Quentin Tarantino's name on it is a masterpiece but each film he's been somehow involved in is at least of good quality(I'm not counting Natural Born Killers since he disowned the film). From Dusk Till Dawn is not an exception. For this film, Tarantino wrote the script but instead his good friend, Robert Rodriguez is in the directors chair. While this collaboration is not without weaknesses, these two talented filmmakers turn out solid entertainment. From Dusk Till Dawn is actually not a story of Tarantino's. On the set of Reservoir Dogs, the make up artist for the film, Robert Kurtzman, told Tarantino that he would work for free if he turned a story(about vampires) he wrote into a film. So four years after Reservoir Dogs, From Dusk Till Dawn arrived in theaters. Even though this is not Tarantino's story he puts his stamp on it (even if that means having a sizeable role in the film). The first half of the film is more dialogue than action. The dialogue that Tarantino penned for this film is not quite up to what he wrote for Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown but there's still some snap to it. The second half although more concentrated on action, still has some good lines (""Psychos do not explode when sun hits them. I don't care how crazy they are."").
The second half of the film is when director Robert Rodriguez gets to shine. Rodriguez has always had a talent for shooting action and that shows here. The over the top action is shot with flair and flawlessly edited (Rodriguez also handled the editing). Rodriguez never allows a dull moment in the entire movie. If theres a major flaw in the film its that I found the film too gross. I know it is supposed to be that gross by intention but it was just a little too much for me. There's nothing wrong with the make-up work though, which is excellent. This is not an actors film, but the performances work here. George Clooney is excellent here. He's given the best lines from Tarantino's script and deliver's them flawlessly. Tarantino himself is acceptable in his role. Effective work is provided by the rest of the cast.From Dusk Till Dawn will probably not appeal to everybody. If you dislike gory films than you should probably avoid From Dusk Till Dawn.

187,lagriff05,Surreal and entertaining.,7,28 June 2009,"This is basically a movie about two robbers, their hostages and a host of drunken truckers and bikers fighting off vampiric strippers in Mexico. Sound good? OK, well, welcome to Robert Rodriguez' From Dusk Till Dawn, the only movie I've ever seen that has managed to so effectively make you afraid of mostly naked women. That has to be some kind of an accomplishment, and Quentin Tarantino is in this movie too - with a writing credit and a healthy post-Pulp Fiction sensibility to boot. That only adds to the surreality of the whole thing.So the movie pretty much jettisons along at rocket speed, with lots of silly moments and some really cool head explosions and gore later on when the slaying starts literally out of nowhere. Why are there vampires in Mexico? I don't know, all I know is that I'm not visiting any strip bars down there. This movie is worth watching though.",From Dusk Till Dawn

For once he tries something different.From Dusk Till Dawn is something else. This is about two criminal brothers(Clooney and Tarantino)wind up taking a family hostage to make it across the Mexican border to a meeting point, a bar called the ""Titty Twister"". That's where the Gecko brothers are to meet another group of crooks.....at dawn. This bar is open from dusk till dawn....and is filled with vampires.This movie starts off as something else at first. More like a gritty crime movie, then becomes a total spatter-fest. This isn't at all bad, just takes a total turn. The vampires here are a bunch of ugly as hell monsters. Think of the Evil Dead movies only the undead zombies and skeletons are vampires instead and that's the score with the very small supply of vampire slayers to take them on.Like I say, if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies, then this is the treat for you. It does not have the amount of silly humor like them, but has the gore nailed just right. The makeup effects are dead-on as well.

190,BrickNash,A script and character triumph unashamedly wrapped in glorious nonsense.,9,7 June 2013,"When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool.The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me.I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched. Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible.The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close.As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that.Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour. Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film.So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool.A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Unfortunately, the script plays out like it's the product of an immature adolescent personality who needs to get out more and mix with other kids his own age. The dialogue is just cringeworthy.One cannot help but think that someone indulged Tarantino based on previous successes in funding this project - indulged him to the point of allowing him to act in it - and made a big boob on all counts.I scare easy but this vampire horror movie with all its (much trumpeted) blood and guts didn't produce a single goosebump.

192,RickHarvey,Two films for the price of one,7,5 July 2010,"Two brothers are on the run from the cops and after finally getting over the border and into Mexico, they decide to stop the night at a remote nightclub. This sentence easily describes the opening half on the film. With Taratino's flick-of-the-tongue dialogue, the first half plays as a great crime thriller. The two brothers , Seth and Richard played by Clooney and Taratino are a interesting pair. Clooney plays the head brother in which he calls all the shots while Taratino plays the sex offender and i have to be honest, his image suits the role. His acting on the other hand is not all to great.Despite Taratino only writing the script for this film, it clearly obvious that he helped with the directing. For example the opening scene in the diner and the Trunk shot at the motel. Then comes Keitel who plays the father who has lost faith in God after the passing of his wife. As always, keitel delivers.The second half turns out to be rather different than the first half. They stop by at a nightclub in which a man welcomes everyone by screaming out a selective list of all types of Pussy. here, we start to meet even more interesting bizarre characters. Danny Trejo as masculine Razor and Tom Savini as the Sex Machine. These two brings more fun and excitement into the film and keeps it rolling without it running out of stream.The last half an hour goes like this: most bikers and truck drivers turn into vampires making themselves a huge threat towards the two brothers and the other normal beings. What we get is Over the top gore which will make you chuckle the first time but after a while begins to get repetitive. As always, we get some great one liners thanks to taratino and basically it all good, gory fun.Some may find this sudden flip hard to take in but if you stay open minded then you should enjoy this film. Seeing George Clooney play this sort of character was a joy and he was most certainly the star of the show. Everyone gave great performances except taratino who just seemed of the ball ( what is up with him and feet?) Overall, your getting two movies in one.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Make sure you're in the right mood. I cannot overemphasize how awesome the cast is. Tarantino isn't much of an actor, but he's great fun here. My favorite scene is when he's hallucinating that Juliette Lewis' character is coming on to him, saying something unprintable here-how I wish I could type it! George Clooney and Harvey Keitel come off best. They play their roles as seriously as possible, as a hilarious counterbalance to the pervading goofiness. And you know what?

When they get to mexico and to a bar called the titty twisters, all hell breaks lose when they find everyone are vampires at the bar. From there on it's a blood bath, with gore and violence every second. When making this film I don't think they were planning on keeping to the rules of killing vampires as many things were wrong in the movie if you listen to the other movies that is. I lived the dialogue in the movie like all Tarrntino movies have. i especially liked the Gecko brothers dialogue(especially Seth) and the owner of the titty twisters when they first arrived at the bar.

199,KatMiss,UNBELIEVABLE MESS!,3,3 May 2001,"""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a disorganized mess which doesn't know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a horror film or a cops-and-robbers flick? A domestic drama or a human comedy? The movie seems to want to have it both ways and the result is an unbelievable mess!It was written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez. Both are talented writer/directors. What went wrong?Well, for starters, Tarantino's script has no focus; it tries to be the horror equivalent of ""Pulp Fiction"" but without that film's slickness and charm. His performance is even worse. Someone should tell Quentin that while he is a really nice guy and is a talented writer and director, he should stay behind the camera. I imagine he pulled this script from the bottom of the drawer after ""Pulp Fiction""'s success.Second, the film's first half is jumbled and boring. We want to see the good stuff and we get it but we have to sit through an hour of crazy talk and boring nonsense. And the vampire stuff is way too over the top to be effective. That is what plagued ""Fright Night Part II"" and the same happens here.There are some good moments among the sleaze. Cheech Marin is funny in a triple role; and George Clooney works hard to salvage this mess. He has a great screen presence and great films such as ""Three Kings"" and ""The Perfect Storm"" confirm it.But even they cannot save the irreparable damage from the first half and while stylish and funny, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is too little too late.* out of 4 stars",From Dusk Till Dawn

Other than that, it's a mindless, ludicrous, gratuitous, gore-fest, with unnecessary religious overtones.It started off so well, and could have rivaled ""Pulp Fiction"" in all departments if they had so chosen.Mr. Tarantino is ill-advised to ""act"" in any of his films; he came very close to ruining Pulp Fiction with his unbelievably crass ""dead n*gger storage"" routine. Fortunately, he wasn't quite so bad here, but they certainly should have cast somebody else. Anybody else.I would even go so far as to say the second half was as bad as Kill Bill II. Yes, that bad.George Clooney is flawless in this. He steals every scene he's in. Harvey Keitel demonstrates why he is one of my favourite actors. Juliette Lewis does herself proud, and makes me wonder why we haven't seen a lot more of her.If you liked Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs and you haven't seen this one yet, I would recommend that you watch it attentively up until they arrive at the Titty Twister, then turn it off and invent your own scenario as to how it might've ended.

203,jamhorner,"Did they look like psychos? They were vampires. Psychos do not explode when sunlight hits them, I don't care how crazy they are!",9,17 October 2007,"""I'm a mean m.,m. servant of God""  Jacob Fuller This would probably be one of the most interesting renditions of a vampire tale of have ever seen. It can be considered as being two movies in one whether it is or not. The first half of the movie is your typical Quentin Tarantino gangland movie. Its starts off with the Gecko Brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (QT) who have just fled a grisly bank robbery and end up kidnapping a retired preacher (Harvey Keitel), his daughter (Juliette Lewis) and his adopted son (Ernest Liu). This half is pure Tarantino for a number of reasons. It is filled with long and interesting dialogue, which makes for good conversation; there is a lot of violence and foul-mouth language. Those reasons would probably be the exact same reasons why I think that this movie is spectacular.This half is almost a cliché, prior to the bank robbery the brothers try to hitch a ride to Mexico so that they could live off of the stolen money. However, Quentin steers away from the cliché by adding in a retired preacher who lost his wife. I love Harvey's performance of a father figure and servant of god rather than a gun-totin' hit man. His character is almost believable. The chemistry between Clooney's Seth and Tarantino's Richard are almost humorous but in the same sense very violent. I think that they work amazingly together. Of course when they get to Mexico the brothers have to stop at a strip club and from there on, it takes a swan dive into hell.The strip club is populated by a sleazy bartender (Danny Trejo), a luscious vixen stripper (Salma Hayek), the raunchy doorman (Cheech Marin), an ex war vet (Fred Williamson) and of coarse the suave Sex Machine (Tom Savini). All of these characters, especially Trejo, Hayek and Marin do a great job in acting out their characters. Even Cheech Marin is scary as hell being a vampire. Tom Savini's Sex Machine is probably one of the funniest characters in a horror movie that I have seen and they all play their parts to perfection. Even the mariachi band does a great job playing there part when it comes time for their transformation.I'll go further to say that vampire strippers are the best concept for this sort of genre. We shouldn't be surprised that QT thought this on up. There is also the cheese factor. There is a lot of corny scenes and cheesy one-liners as well as cheesy fight scenes such as a spaghetti western-style fight scene between the survivors and the vampire strippers. Another great cheesy scenes is filling squirt guns with holy water and making condom balloons with holy water. If you are not scared by now then you'll surly be laughing by now since this movie is so ridiculously well made by Quentin and Robert Rodriguez. Of course the cheese factor does sort of steer away from the story and the unnoticeable plot but I still enjoyed myself.The set was great. Half of the movie takes place on the road and the other half takes place in a strip club that looks like a ancient pyramid decorated with Christmas lights, frill, vodka bottles and naked women. The front of the club looks like skid row gone horribly wrong, with motorcyclists and a huge tire fire, with skinned cow skulls and empty beer bottles lying all over the place.In a hasty conclusion this movie was fun to watch, very fun to watch and although it has it's cheesy moments it's still a great vampire flick by two great writers and directors that should not be missed. I would highly recommend this film to any horror and gore nut out there. I certainly liked and I hope you do to.",From Dusk Till Dawn

This is a rather violent, action movie that could have easily been a turn off, but Robert Rodriguez took Quentin's story and they made an entertaining movie. Quentin's characters always seem to have so much life to them and I think that's what makes the movie better. It could have easily just been a cheesy, totally unbelievable action/horror piece. Not that we're going to walk away thinking what happened could really happen, but as I was watching the movie I wasn't considering the plausibility and was just enjoying the ride.

The acting was also some of the worst I had seen. This film felt endless (in terms of duration). I was completely disappointed. Aside from the good introduction that is Pulp Fiction-esque, the entire movie is monotonous.

(The only weak point is the Chinese lad who plays Harvey Keitel's son, and who seems incapable to convey any emotion whatsoever, but it's just a minor drawback.) When the characters arrive at the Titty Twister, you might notice the film starting to become a little corny, but don't worry, just hold on for a minute, the best scene of the movie is coming up.Marvel and drool at the phenomenal physique of Salma Hayek, whose body is so perfect in this movie she seem almost superhuman.

This is to avoid the temptation you might have to press ""PLAY"" again sometime later in the day, which you would regret.Now go for a walk, or sit in your favourite a bar with a drink, and try to imagine how the story might continue from that point on. Maybe Tarantino jumps on Juliette Lewis and forces Harvey Keitel to finally confront the brothers and bring them to justice (with the help of Satanico, who ironically turns out to be a devout Christian); maybe when Carlos arrives he turns out to be an undercover Mexican Federal working with the FBI and the brothers continue their escape taking the family (and Satanico) with them deeper into Mexico and becoming more and more desperate along the way; maybe ""Carlos"" double-crosses them and they are all forced to hole themselves up in the bar and fight together for their lives against the Mexican mob...but WHATEVER you come up with, I guarantee you this: it will be better than the absurd silliness that Tarantino and Rodriguez cooked up, ruining what could have otherwise been a very good film.

He asked if Tarantino thought that the rape in the motel would be funny? No, it's not supposed to be funny. The movie isn't a comedy and that scene in particular shows that Richie has problems, despite appearing to being seemingly normal in the beginning.",From Dusk Till Dawn
227,dj_xand325,"Two best friends come together to make a fun, eccentric modern B-movie that i thoroughly enjoyed!",6,29 March 2008,"Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino met at the Cannes film festival (when Tarantino won best picture for pulp fiction) and they got talking and found out they had similar film interest. Rodriguez said to Tarantino that he would love to make a horror film in Mexico and alas Tarantino had already written the script and offered Rodriguez to direct it!. Almost a natural bond between the two that has amounted to the production of this bloody, fun and quixotic b-movie that is 'From Dusk till Dawn' Its a film of two parts, one part is the saga of the criminal gecko brothers (Tarantino and clooney) trying to get into Mexico and away from the American law where they can pursue a happy life. In order to do this, they abduct an innocent family who are grieving the death of their mother/wife who recently died tragically. They're fragile and weak so being abducted by two psycho criminals isn't the ideal treatment for them!. It also becomes apparent that Richard Gecko (Tarantino) has an ardent sexual desire for the young girl of the family. Tarantino plays a sick deranged and mentally disturbed character that seems to be a sexual offender. While Seth Gecko (clooney) seems to be more calculated and clever than Richard, he is still criminal trash that only cares about himself and his brother. The Geckos hide the families bathroom in their caravan and force them to go through the Mexican/American border. This first part is a sample of some typical quick, crisp and stimulating script work from Tarantino that is a true joy to watch.Now onto the second part, after arriving into Mexico, they are told to meet a friend at a sick bar called the 'titty twister'. The bar turns out to be a grisly place where vampires feed on the visiting truckers. Upon arrival, we are served with an orgy of gore, vampires and true outrageous b-movie horror!.As for the performances of the cast, Clooney's performance was top notch and he captured his character perfectly. As for Tarantino, he was nominated for a razzie for it!. While it wasn't the greatest acting I've ever seen, it was fine! and you have to remember that hes a director not an actor!. Keital was great as always. Juliette Lewis (who was earlier in Tarantino's natural born killers) plays a very different character to the deranged one she played in NBK, shes an innocent girl that has unfairly suffered the loss of her whole family.Some people prefer the first part to the second part and vice-versa. But personally, i enjoyed the whole film and although it wasn't a masterpiece or anywhere near as good as Tarantino's other work, I give it a 6 simply because of how much i enjoyed it.This is sheer entertainment but be aware, you may not get the b-movie style and hate it! But still its worth a watch! 6/10",From Dusk Till Dawn

My friend rented it out from our local video store and bought it over to my place. Back then, we only had blank movie covers for new releases when they came out so you didn't see the cover or have the blurb on the back. My mate just said you have to watch this.I was loving the film as it was and it went it got to the big reveal midway through the film, it blew my mind. From then on it was all gore and vampire violence and I was cheering. I was not expecting that at all.The movie is very violent but the violence is also met with a lot of humour. I am not the biggest fan of George Clooney, but his character of Seth Gecko remains one of my favourite bad asses in cinema history.If you love vampire movies with a lot of gore and humour then you must check this out. There is a lot of funny quotes to be have which I have quoted several tiles over the years. To me, it's one of the last good vampire movies to be made in years and it came out in 1996The movie is directed by Robert Rodriquez who is an amazing director and it's based on a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino who also stars in the movie as Seth's sleazy murderous brother.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Halfway through this crime movie, our protagonists and their hostages arrive at a nudie bar, where there is a sudden tonal shift. One minute Tarantino's drinking whisky off a stripper's foot, next thing you know, everybody's fighting for their lives against an army of vampires. I wouldn't even call it horror, so much as it is a gory, blood-soaked action sequence. Over half of the movie is spent in the bar. One by one the characters die, they have their cliché ""if I turn, kill me"" moment, and I'm left wondering what just happened. It's kind of funny, but mostly just odd and unexpected. The effects, makeup and blood look good. The performances by Clooney and Tarantino are interesting enough. It's a pretty decent little flick, but not what I was expecting.

The dynamic between the Gecko brothers was a real highlight with Tarantino's character being a fascinatingly demented psychopath. Once the vampires show up it turns into an all-out B-movie style action flick which is fine, but it is kind of silly and the vulgarity is a little over the top in the strip joint. The ending also underwhelmed with a noticeable lack of resolution. Ultimately I'd give the first half of the movie a 7 and the last half a 6.",From Dusk Till Dawn
232,fxdx4,A fun blood bath with great writing and delivery (just skip the ending)!,8,20 September 2019,"Coming close to 25 years after its first release, I rewatched From Dusk Till Dawn, and it surprisingly holds up well. Although Clooney later goes on to win an Oscar for his dramatic roles, I think this is his best role. The Tarantino/ Rodriguez team is stellar at getting the most out of their actors, and understands cool moments. This film is no different, hoping from cool scene to cool scene with great performances all around.The Gecko brothers have escaped prison, and for the first 1/2 of the film we watch them flee from the law. Once they manage to escape to Mexico, well that is when the Vampires come in. There is not much to spoil in this film, as Clooney and Tarantino (in his biggest film role) go from scene to scene of carnage and cool. The usual Tarantino tropes are all here, and for the most part all hit.The special effects have not aged particularly well, but they aren't terrible either. And the 'CG' is laughable (I thought this the first time I saw it in the 90s too, and 20 years has not improved it at all).Now any film with Vampires can't be taken too seriously, however this Tarantino/Rodriguez film is the beginnings of their trend of having cool films devolve into silliness near the end. It does get ridiculous and dumb to a gowning fault by the end. My best advice is simply wait till there are 15 minutes left in the film and simply turn it off then. It's better that way.",From Dusk Till Dawn

He didn't tell me anything about it so I just went for it. I have got to say I wasn't that impressed at first but as the film went on I started to 'tune in' so to speak. By the end I was really impressed and after a few more viewings I just loved it more each time. I it not a great classic but personally I never get bored watching this film. Some of you out there probably wont like it for all sorts of reasons and I suppose the purists will deride it but I like it and I would recommend anybody watch it all the way through at least once.

It was funny and scary (very scary) and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was watching it. I think it must be somewhere in the Robert Rodriguez touch.

236,CWP-,"Stupid, stupid second half",7,18 September 1999,"My Age: 13Two criminal brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko, played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, begin a crime spree driving through Texas, trying to get to Mexico where a man has promised them sanctuary in exchange for 30% of their stolen money.  To ensure that they get across the border, they take a preacher named Jacob Fuller, played by Harvey Keitel, and his two children, played by Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu, hostage.  Once they get across the border, they go to a bar called the Titty Twister where they encounter vampires.From Dusk Till Dawn starts off promisingly enough, with the plot of the two brothers on a crime spree, which takes up the first half of the movie. Until the vampires come in, the movie is quite good, enjoyable, and it makes sense.  The second half, however, when the vampire plot comes in just completely ruins the movie.  They just go to a bar and there are vampires. The movie gives you no reason why they are there, what their origins are, or how they came to being.  There is absolutely no plot in it, it is just killing, killing, and more brainless killing.  Everything that had been accomplished in the first half of the movie, including its plot, is just thrown out the window and replaced by stupidity and violence.  Why did they even bother with the first half's plot, when it is just going to be thrown away by the rest of the movie.  I enjoy violent action films a lot, but I didn't even enjoy seeing these vampires being gunned down countless times. The whole second half of the movie is set in only two rooms, and one of them for only about 5 minutes.  It would have been much better if they could have proceeded into the depths of the building to encounter the vampires.  I wish they had made this into two movies.  The first half's plot would have made for an impressive movie by itself, and if the second half's vampire plot had been stretched into one movie by itself, it may have had time to proceed into the depths of the building, explain where they came from and why they were there.  Just think of all the talent wasted in this movie: George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek, Ernest Liu, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez.

238,soymilk,"Starts brilliantly, but takes an odd turning",7,21 March 2005,"An odd one, this. It starts out as one thing, establishes the opening mood very well, and then half-way through, just as we're really starting to get into it, it completely changes in tone, atmosphere and even genre into something slightly less impressive. I'm left wondering if it was Rodriguez's intention all along to create a flick that, very movie monster-like, is one thing by day and something very different altogether by night. Against a daylight setting, it's a crime thriller/character study wrapped up in a road movie, complete with sparkling dialogue, neat direction and interesting characters  and, as with any film revolving round a road trip, the real fun is always in the getting there. Maybe that's the problem  our heroes get to where they're going before we've even reached the midway point. It's here, in the nocturnal-based scenes, that the film undergoes its massive transformation, morphing into a rather raucous and grotesque kind of popcorn horror (though admittedly a tad too gruesome to inspire much of an appetite for popcorn consumption) with blood-sucking vampires, exploding heads and bodily fluid leakage aplenty. In merging the two distinctive halves together, I'm not sure just how successful it really is. It's certainly very different, captures the viewer off-guard as it goes, and the latter half still manages to provide decent, if mindless, entertainment, but it ultimately can't help but prove a mild disappointment in not quite living up to the slickness promised in the initial scenes.The earlier scenes are the ones I personally prefer watching. It's here that the characters, when we're first introduced to them, are at their utmost best  the composed and easygoing criminal fugitive Seth Gecko, his immature, anti-social younger brother Ritchie, and, from the other side of the tracks, Jacob, a preacher-turned-agnostic widower with two teenage kids, all of whom are forced to accompany Seth and Ritchie on their run from the law when their paths inadvertently cross. The interaction that ensues between all five of these characters is excellent, the acting is fine (Clooney and Kietel both pull off their roles with ease, and, contrary to some critical bandwagons, Tarantino isn't bad at all) while there's a certain sprinkling of depth to them each that you desperately want the movie to work with. It's tempting sometimes, on repeated viewings, just to tune out once the vampire scenes get underway, not so much due to the goriness involved, but because what becomes of these characters from then on is a little unsatisfying. There are a few rewarding moments in between as both the kidnappers and their hostages begin to show signs of bonding and mutual understanding, but the beastly confrontations that soon entail never truly enable them to develop to their full potential  well, face it, what we have here is a brilliant ensemble of protagonists who could have faired easily as well in a more sophisticated adventure than the one they wound up with.The humor in the sunlight half is also better accomplished, and fits in perfectly with the tension  healthy servings of macabre quirkiness as Ritchie examines his hand wound during the opening credits sequence (ouchnasty), and the inspired bickering between the two fugitive siblings as they exit the scene of one of their crimes, none of which detract from the screenplay's tenser moments. The nocturnal half, meanwhile, is obviously too silly to pass itself off as serious horror, and a mite too ugly to be all that amusing (still get a few giggles here and there, but what it mostly triggers, amidst all the guitar-strumming on dismantled human body parts, is unease). Even Tarantino's excellent scripting skills get a little bogged down in the subject matter around here, to the point where his zesty style seems completely absent. It would be wrong, however, to imply that the sequences involving those nefarious blood-suckers are lacking in a distinguishing edge of their own  Rodriguez does a good job with the atmospherics here in particular, highlighting the claustrophobic, infernal feel of the vampires' lair and giving it an appropriately nightmarish quality. That's probably the thing that works best about it.What 'From Dusk Till Dawn' ultimately amounts to is an energetic and very enjoyable kind of summer movie, memorable and unusual enough to be worthy of the cult following it grabbed soon after. If you can accept it for what it is, then its entertainment value is guaranteed, and, as a loyal Tarantino fan, I've found plenty of things to savour. Still, a part of me will always wonder about the intelligent character drama that might have been had the Gecko brothers chosen to travel down a slightly different junction.Grade: B+",From Dusk Till Dawn
239,LongTimeMovieLover,The Film That Made Clooney,8,11 September 2019,"Tarantino made Clooney's movie career with this pic, and Clooney stepped up delivering the strong snappy lines. This movie is a wild ride, fun nonsense.",From Dusk Till Dawn
240,eddie052010,"A perfect Friday night movie, but not much else.",6,23 January 2015,"Vampire movies are very hit or miss, as for every Nosferatu or Blade, there is a Twilight: Breaking Dawn or Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter rearing its ugly head around the corner. So, with a strong budget, cast and writing/directing team of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez behind it, how does this one fare? To be honest, very averagly, as despite some great things, there isn't much that this movie had to offer that many others have done already.The story is that criminal brothers Seth and Richard Gecko have recently broken out of prison and are travelling to Mexico to give their fellow gangsters some money. However, they encounter some problems, including kidnapping some hostages, trying to get across the US-Mexico border and how their meeting point with the aforementioned gangsters turns out to be full of vampires. Can they survive until dawn? The plot is very simple, and works for a B-movie homage like this, despite occasional plot holes here and there (i.e. why the vampires kill lorry drivers specifically). The plot isn't the only thing that's very shallow. Most of the characters are two-dimensional at best, with the standouts being George Clooney's Seth Gecko, as the character and Clooney oozes cool, and Harvey Kietel's father character, a widow who is desperately trying to look after his kids and the criminals, to the point where he will sacrifice his life for them. This makes him the character with the most depth in the movie, and Kietel plays him very well with an equal amount of boldness and restraint. The rest of the characters are slightly dull, but the actors do their best with weak material. The only dud here is Juliette Lewis, acting so robotic and lifeless, bringing none of the talent and charisma she had in Cape Fear, What's Eating Gilbert Grape and even Natural Born Killers. But the film isn't really concerned with plot or characters, but rather the mindless vampire action. After a good half an hour of talking and build up, the film turns into a series of vampire fights, which to be fair are quite cool. Robert Rodriguez is a brilliant action director, and this movie shows that off in spades, as the action scenes have good choreography and a quick pace, which make them enjoyable and fun to watch. The effects are also quite good as well, as despite the fact that a lot of CGI is used, are very impressive. The vampires themselves are quite unique as well, combining influences from films like The Evil Dead and The Thing as well as original ideas to create a truly unique set of creatures. However, the despite what fun you have watching the film, there isn't enough substance to reward multiple viewings. It's essentially junk food: it's nice enough and satisfies you for what it is, but is isn't anything substantial. I understand that the movie has a strong cult following, but to be honest, this is just a forgettable vampire film that doesn't offer you much outside of fun action and some good acting. It may be very appealing to you if you were a teenage boy who didn't know any better, but to be honest, the film isn't very good, and while it's fine for one watch, it doesn't really warrant repeat viewings for those looking for more depth. So overall, this is just a mediocre vampire film with occasional moments of brilliant here and there. Nothing more, nothing less. Still, it's a better Tarantino/Rodriguez collaboration than Four Rooms, I guess.",From Dusk Till Dawn
241,fullonrobotchubby,(Be ready to groan at a pun... ready?...) This sucks.,1,17 August 2006,"I love dissing this movie. My peers always try their best to defend it, probably out of love for Quentin Tarantino or Harvey Keitel, but they'll never convince me that this one should be treasured. Here's some huge reasons why: A: The plot goes from kidnapping road trip movie to vampire-inhabited strip bar slasher flick with no set-up whatsoever. Suddenly something very real turns into something very fake, which is like sitting the audience down to a Thanksgiving feast then exploding it with dynamite. B: That untalented Juliette Lewis is in it. C: Preposterous ideas abound such as actual torso-and-leg guitars, brothers with the last name ""Gecko,"" bad vampire make-up jobs, Cheech Marin playing three characters (?), and a crotch-based gun that only fires when ""erect"" and belongs to a guy who goes by ""Sex Machine."" If Robert Rodriguez didn't pathetically try to be so innovative with his violence, I might've had fun with this obvious popcorn flick. The whole project's like he got the ideas by playing with action figures. The only thing even close to being considered my favorite scene is George Clooney's laugh-out-loud cheesy monologue after he kills his blood-sucking, horny-for-children, terrible-acting brother.

So to keep my ""credibility"" as a cinephile, I finally said to myself ""self, watch this movie now, no more waiting."" I also asked myself, ""what do I know about this movie?"" Well, it's got Clooney, Tarantino acts in it, Salma Hayek has a sexy dance with a sexy snake, and vampires are a big thing in the movie. Even knowing all that and with the movie being as old as it is, this movie completely caught me by surprise.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play two criminals, Seth and Richard Gecko, that are on the run, which we find out right off the bat, in a incredible opening sequence in a gas station. There eyes are set on the Mexican border for an escape, so they spot a little family (the father played by Harvey Keitel) traveling in an RV and get the idea to hijack the vehicle and take the polite family hostage. When the group get's to there destination, a shady little Mexican bar, all hell breaks loose when vampires turn out to run the place.It sounds corny, it sounds cheesy, campy, laughable, maybe a bit over the top, but BY THE NINE, this is not only a cool crime movie, not only is it a dark, creepy vampire movie, but this is a great movie in it's own right. It's so unique and good at how it tell's the story, and you gotta give major credit to director Robert Rodriguez, because the first half of the movie just feels like a dark, gritty, crime-thriller and if the movie would've just kept that tone through out I would've been perfectly fine, but once the setting jumps the fence into Mexico, a whole other level of a movie is unleashed. George Clooney gives one of my favorite performances I've seen from him, he has this menacing screen presence that he doesn't show anymore and I thought was really good. Harvey Keitel is always great in his more gruff roles, I thought he was terrific as the father of the distressed, kidnapped family. It's a bit of a different role and he did a very good job going back and forth with George Clooney. Salma Hayek, my goodness, no words can describe the spell I was in with her screen presence. It's not a groundbreaking role by any means, she's there mostly to look good and that she does. Tarantino has a larger than normal role, he was enjoyable as well, but his real contribution to this movie is his screenplay. The dialog is so spot on and really meshes perfectly with the more crime driven first half. Vampires are kind of a punchline in movies now a days, this film gives the fanged creatures a very good treatment. There's a lot of use practical effects and make-up, the vampires look creepy and demonic and the action is filmed well. There's a shot that stands out to me in the beginning, where Clooney and Tarantino are walking away from a gas station store engulfed in flames. It's one continuous shot, and as the actors are saying their lines, in the back you see flames spitting out and little explosions throwing debris everywhere, you can tell it was done on set, and I loved it. I loved the vampire ""twist"" at the end, but I will say that the horror element did kind of get me at a stand still moment, only because the way the movie started as this really intense crime thriller with these two brothers intrigued me. I would have liked to see them stretch on that further, but the insane second half still did it for me, it was a fun watch, and has officially became my favorite vampire movie of all time.",From Dusk Till Dawn
244,Jakethemuss,would you like a movie with your violence sir?,8,13 August 2007,"Lets cut straight to the point. This is no masterclass in cinema, this is no thought provoking, intellectual study of human nature, or anything for that matter. Reality and subtlety go straight out the window for this flick. It starts as what looks like another ""bad robbers take hostages"" movie, but soon enough descends into a 'feast your eyes on this' gloriously OTT, bloodthirsty, semi-comic piece of gore porn.It tells the tale of bank-robbing brothers Seth (Clooney)and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko, who are on the run from the law after several murders. Soon enough they run into a small family travelling in an RV, the father Jacob (Keitel) daughter Kate (Lewis) and son Scott (Lui). The Gecko's use them and their RV as means to cross the boarder into Mexico, where the brother have a meeting with a drug baron arranged. The meet is to take place at a brightly lit, Gothic looking venue called the ""Titty Twister"" out in the desert. It is about now that the film starts to turn into another genre, the hostage plot steps back into the shadow as the bar's employee's turn out to be seriously, and I mean SERIOUSLY bad news.Does this mean it is bad? NO, I actually thought it was awesome upon first viewing and still do now. Its one of those totally uninhibited films you can sit back and enjoy without having to think too much. It is gripping from the start, seeing the Brothers run into various obstacles whilst evading capture, then later watching with baited breath as the remaining survivors trapped inside the Titty Twister contemplate their rather unfortunate situation.Clooney is especially good as wise cracking but highly dangerous Seth Gecko, its quite a change from his other roles.

The script, as I said, its pretty mediocre.

Another aspect I enjoyed are two characters who are introduced later in the film who are totally bad*ss and really make this film an exciting ride.You may believe i didn't like the movie because of all of the problems I have stated, but I really had a blast with a really fun (and sexy) film, and I am giving it a 7/10 instead of a 6/10 for that very reason.It is a fun movie!

As soon as I saw the ""Titty Twister"" neon light, I knew this movie was over. Cheech Marin's speech was gross-out and funny, but no line could save this piece of dung. When the lead dancer made that Looney-Tune-esq morph into a vampire, I literally spit soda all over the floor. My nose felt like it had just had a gigantic hit of crack from the mass explosion of soda that fell onto the floor below. The lead dancer then leaped forward and bit Tarantino's neck, which had to be either the stupidest or most awkward scene ever made, or maybe both. The movie degenerates from there, with an entirely clichéd vampire flick that came from nowhere. The only way I could describe this is the following: imagine a senior citizen center with a nice bingo game going on, and then 5 seconds later guerrillas rush in and mow everyone down and raze the place. That's exactly how this ""twist"" was. Finally (Spoilers) everybody dies but Clooney and Lewis, who walk out of the vampire hell hole leaving Lewis to go anywhere she wants. If they played the Cast Away end theme with Lewis looking off in the 3 other directions that didn't have mutilated corpses in them it would not have been out of place. In fact, it might have done this lame piece of crap justice.3 / 10",From Dusk Till Dawn
248,spfi,Bloody good time,7,27 December 2001,"Just when I thought 'Dead Alive' was the goriest movie of all time, here comes 'From Dusk Till Dawn'. While the film gives us virtually no one to root for, the characterization is done well by writer Tarintino and George Clooney is so damn cool (I'm tempted to ad 'of course'). the movie Jaws kept people out of the water. This could keep men out of the T & A clubs.",From Dusk Till Dawn
249,ratpackaustin,"This is a bad movie, but I love it anyway",7,20 March 2019,"Ok don't get me wrong, this movie could've been WAY worse. For what it is, it's actually a decent flick, but it's terrible at the same time.First I'll start with the acting. The acting is pretty bad. Tarantino is not a good actor, and he just looks awkward in his role. Luckily he plays a socially awkward character so he can get away with it this time. However the two actors that play the pastors (Jacob's) children were awful. The boy gave dialogue that looked like it was coming off a que card off screen. The girl sounded like she was forgetting her lines and then remembering them as she was speaking. Both actors sounded monotone and inorganic. Other actors just mumbled through their dialogue as if they'd never tried acting before. The one bright spot for the acting is Clooney. This is actually one of the best Clooney performances I've seen, because he carries the whole movie on his shoulders. There is little to run with in this movie, but he did it and somehow gave an awesome performance.
Next comes the rest. I couldn't help but notice awkward things in the movie that are generally found in B-movies. For example when characters are talking while fighting the vampires, in the background you can see vampires just standing there. They're not moving or trying to attack the characters, they're literally just standing there or waving a chair around for no reason.
All In all I loved this movie and am a fan of ridiculous movies in general. So I'll give this a 7/10.",From Dusk Till Dawn

A Texas Ranger pulls into a gas station and makes everyday chit-chat with the cashier. And then, before you know it, people are getting shot, the gas station is exploding, and the opening credits start. Even though the opening is excellent, the second half of the movie is not as good as the first half. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by his good friend Robert Rodriguez. Both of their famous trademarks are made in the movie. The story is of two criminal brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) who drive across Texas taking hostages (Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis) and hope to make it across the border to a rendezvous at a bar. But what they find is a bar where the customers come straight from Hell. Like I said early, the first half of the movie is excellent. It begins as the coolest movie I have ever seen. What more could you ask for? You've got George Clooney, one of the coolest actors today, in a film done by two of the coolest guys in Hollywood (and one of them is even in the movie!). And Salma Hayek is the sexiest woman on the planet! After seeing her dance, I completely forgot why they were even at the bar. But then....it happened: The Vampires. The second half of the film takes a turn for the worse when it goes wacko and all the customers in the bar turn to Vampires, and the brothers and the hostages are forced to work together to fight against them.This is truely a great film, not in the fashion of Citizen Kane, but just for the entertainment and coolness factor. This is one of the rare movies that you never want to end. If it wasn't for the poor second half, I would give it a higher rating, but in the end, the film defines cool.

256,peter-ramshaw-1,Two for the price of one,8,20 January 2007,"So, what's wrong with a film that is actually two films? Some commentators seem to suggest that's necessarily a bad thing. Nothing says films have to be linear, straight line things - and you can bet that anything Tarantino is involved in probably won't be.I was a little surprised when what started out to be a taut and thought-provoking brutal crime film noir turned into a comedy vampire flick, I'll admit. Didn't see it coming at all. But, was I offended or feel cheated? No. Both 'halves' of the film were enjoyable in their deferent ways. Tell you the truth, Tarantino's character in the first half was SO evil I was actually wondering if I could sit through another forty or fifty minutes of such tautness waiting for him to harm Juliette Lewis in some way. That is, of course, just a tip of the hat to Tarantino's writing skill.Not that the film didn't try to at least tie in the vampire slash-fest at the end with the thriller at the beginning. For example, Tarantino's evil, sex-crime, murderer was at least killed, in his turn, by a woman (a sex crime in itself) and so there is a measure of poetic justice (well, a lot of it if you think out how each of the characters dies I guess) in all of this.This is definitely one to just kick back and enjoy, though. Too much introspection will ruin it for sure. The music is terrific and Clooney is possibly the best I've ever seen him. Don't slag Tarantino off of for acting either, he's pretty good in this - more for what he doesn't say than what he does.In short, halfway through this film you think you're watching something special and are going to get value for money and, in the end you do but maybe not for the reasons you think at the halfway mark. It's a film that is ultra serious and, in fact frighteningly horrifying, at first and then just laughs the crap out of itself and the horror genre for the rest of the time. I think (and I'm no expert) that Tarantino and Rodriguez are saying here that REAL LIFE is far more terrifying than HORROR. If so, they hit the nail on the head perfectly.Very hard not to like.PS: Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong) plays three parts and they are all a hoot.",From Dusk Till Dawn

258,Habibi-Universe,Why go for the twist?,5,9 November 2020,"Robert Rodriguez's 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (1996) is an action crime film about two criminals taking hostages with the objective to go to a place in Mexico safely.The film was written by Quentin Tarantino and he surprisingly even has a pretty big role in this film!Let's first talk about the first half of the film because we do need to talk about it without spoilers of course!
The first half watches itself like a classic Tarantino film (even though it was directed by Robert Rodriguez). We are familiar with Tarantino's way of writing dialogue which we know from countless of his other films such as 'Reservoir Dogs' (1992), 'Pulp Fiction' (1994), 'Inglourious Basterds' (2009), 'Django Unchained' (2012), just to name a few! The way Rodriguez manages to keep the tension high while telling his story, is pretty impressive! The actor who impressed me the most was George Clooney! He is completely in character throughout the entire film and he plays his role so well! I also don't know why Tarantino was criticized for his performance because he was good!And now onto the second half of the film which essentially starts off with a big twist that remains relevant for the rest of the film!
Oh boy... WHY?! The film was doing pretty well up until the point. But from then on, it turned into this weird, trashy film, a wacky horror flick! I think choosing thar route hurt the film's quality, but I still respect that this film clearly aimed for a specific fan base who would eat this film up! Even though it did not quite work for me, I still appreciate the creativity behind it!Overall, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a film that will work for people who are just looking for a fun and purely entertaining film. At the end of the day, you really shouldn't take this film all that serious because it doesn't take itself serious! 5/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
259,owen_twistfield,Baffled,4,19 June 2007,"This movie left me completely baffled. As said by others, it starts out as a sort of road movie and then turns into a horror(well sort of). Each of these genre's have something typical, but in this movie there is only one guiding principle: violence. There are other movies which are violent, like Cross of Iron, the Wild Bunch, Saving Private Ryan, Psycho or Letters from Iwo Jima. I liked these movies because each of these movies have something else to offer besides violence. Sure there is a weak effort to make some fun like in the living dead series. Sure a tongue in cheek effort is made to hint at the vampire genre. Sure there is the sexy dancing. But it lacks the fun, it lacks the twist and about the sex:after Selma Hayek has done her stimulating dance she is gone in a minute because what is left is violence: pure, undiluted, utter, gory, bloody, sexy violence.

The Final act was good, but the script was dilated by the direction and ends with God knows what kind of ending.Overall I would say the screenplay was really nice, the story was good enough but it is mainly the direction which did not make the film what it could have been.

Plot: Two bad-boy thieves and a Faithless preacher's family become turbulently entangled on their escape to Mexico to seek sanctuary which will arrive at the break of dawn. All they need to do is make it through the night at what would seem to be the sleaziest bar in Mexico. Then Salma Hayek happens.Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are not amateur film makers. Harvey Keitel and George Clooney are not rookie actors serving lunch on Melrose for a day job. What we have here is a flimsy idea backed by Hollywood's finest. Tarantino's Rebirth of Cool' combined with Rodriguez' flair for the dramatic gives the audience a joyride throughout. From every head gesture by Clooney to every `P^$$y' remark by Cheech Marin, you can tell the actors really had fun with this one. And let me tell you it's nice seeing actors having fun, for all of a sudden their true talent surfaces.  Of course the soundtrack is more than adequate, only one more element drawing you in to this world of murderers and thieves. The film editing is actually very appropriate and only enhances the overall intentions of the film.*Spoiler*After watching the film a few times more I began to realize the story is more a fantasy, where El Rey is merely a mythical location for sanctuary. The subjects were put more or less to a test of faith. It is not uncommon for these movie makers to include some folklore and legend. This movie dives in to regions of the occult and makes reference to Anne Rice's idea of the Theater of Vampires. When Salma Hayek begins the body shot, the coin flips. The movie becomes Hitchcock morphed in to Evil Dead'*End Spoiler*Bottom Line: What if Quentin Tarantino began drinking half way through his screen writing process and decided to make his action/comedy into a B-Movie Zombie Flick? Would it stand up in court? Answer: Yes it would. What if Rodriguez had to come up with a movie to rival Desperado'? Would he sell out to Hollywood?

267,nvjs,Horrible blandpire flick,2,6 July 2012,"With names on this ""movie"" that have then newcomers Tarantino and Rodriguez on them, you'd probably expect something half-way decent. If you have an discerning taste in quality films, you'll quickly realize that this ""movie"" is probably one that when mentioned to Clooney, Tarantino, or Rodriguez, will probably get you those contemptuous stares of ""you're just being an a$$hole"". But in my opinion, it isn't trash talking if it's true. This venture starts out with Tarantino and Clooney as brothers who're hiding out from the law. In particular a bigoted sheriff played by veteran actor, Michael Parks, who's in a liquor store shooting the breeze with a backwood, desert rat named Benny about what nosey, small hicktown, busybodys talk about. Then the sheriff does his job of exposition on two a-hole brothers who're in the middle of a robbing/murder spree which started in Kansas after Tarantino's character busted Clooney's character out of a corrections facility. Now if the ""movie"" had taken a more serious tone from the beginning, in true Tarantino and Rodriguez fashion, it might have actually been good. Where I think it all goes bad is when the two plus Harvey Keitel's character and his adopted Chinese son and daughter take temporary refuge in Mexico at a dive against their will. Since the family are captives hijacked for their ""self-contained"" R.V. by the brothers.What follows is mess of cliché'd special effects and fairly cheap make-up effects and gratuitous violence preceded by oodles of topless women who are *gasp* blandpires.This ""movie"" is just gory for gore's sake. To compensate for a lack of story, imagination, and for Tarantino a lack of clever dialogue. The only redeeming virtue in the entire movie is Salma Hayek's exotic/erotic dancing with a yellow boa constrictor for good exotic measure. This is the only semblance of class or sophistication in the entire ""movie"" since she remains clothed in a luscious, velvet bikini.Then the festivities end when the blandpires show their true colors by slaughtering en masse a whole barroom of patrons. It is as dumb as it sounds. This ""movie"" makes no contribution to the blandpire sub-genre. Interview with the Vampire and Bram Stoker's Dracula brought back the romanticized and urbane blandpire established by Stoker and Lugosi, Blade Agave gave blandpires a more realistic and scientific weight to their folklorish nomenclature of sunlight, garlic, silver and so on. Then 30 Days of Night stripped all that away and made blandpires nothing more than savage parasites truly to be feared.All From Dusk til Dawn manages is...uh...well you got gratuitous profanity by a master dialogue scribe and equally copious amounts of gore. What is kind of funny about it, is that all of the ""actors"" behave as though this isn't the first, second, or even tenth time they went to a dive and encountered this sort of a debacle! And to think this is what Clooney gave up E.R. for. But it get's worse, he followed this up with that dreadful Batman and Robin and all it's ingloriousness and homo-eroticism. But hey, not every movie can have the same pedigree of Heat, Braveheart, or Citizen Kane.

268,EJBaggaley,"Richie, would you do me a favour and eat my p*s*y for me...please?",7,23 April 2005,"The film 'From Dusk till Dawn' is a fantastic film for the excellent choice of actors, great soundtrack and extreme storyline made this film into a one of a kind. I can understand, however, a person not liking this film, but in order to appreciate this film you have to have the right mindset. By doing so you must realise that you can't take this film seriously and that its just another typical black horror Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarentino film. What I love about this film is how extreme the storyline changes on how an ordinary family gets kidnapped by wanted criminals, Seth Gecko(George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) and is forced by these criminals to smuggle them in their camper-van over the Mexican border and how the story changes from that to blood sucking vampires killing everybody in the Mexican biker nightclub. I quite like this style of directing for the director Stanley Kubrick has a similar directing approach, for many of his films story lines do tend to rapidly change half way through the film in the same way. Another directing trademark that Robert Rodriguez and Stanley Kubrick have in common, that I'm quite entertained by is the micro-second subliminal film shots that was filmed in this movie, in which the same micro-second subliminal filming was also done in Stanley Kubricks film 'A Clockwork Orange' This happened when Seth Gecko(George Clooney) walked into the motel room and viewed the woman hostage lying dead on his bed, in which his brother Richard gecko (Quentin Tarantino) had just raped and killed.The actors Juliette Lewis(Kate Fuller), George Clooney(Seth Gecko), Quentin Tarantino(Richard Gecko and Harvey Keitel(Jacob Fuller) are ideal actors for this film. What intrigues me about Harvey Keitel, George Clooney and Juliette Lewis is not the fact that their good actors, but is how confident their acting is, for in my opinion these actors (and a few other actors) are three of the most confident actors in Hollywood. What I like about Quentin Tarantino is that although he's not a great actor, the role that he does play in this film (and others) he does well at, for his eccentric acting, humour and wacky outlook makes me love watching him in films.

270,TJ1380,Quentin Tarantino writes a horror movie,8,11 June 2005,"If you read my one-line summary and have seen any of Quentin Tarantino's other movies, then you probably know what to expect from this one. It's violent, depraved, twisted, darkly comic, and it has great dialog. This description applies to just about anything Tarantino is involved in, and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is no different in that respect. Where ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" differs from other movies written and/or directed by Quentin Tarantino is that it is the only movie that he has done where the second half of the movie is devoted to a bloodbath involving a horde of vampires, a Mexican strip club, and a guy with a gun hidden in his codpiece. If that last sentence didn't inspire you to go out and rent this movie right now, then I feel truly sorry for you.This movie is what every cheesy horror movie often fails to be: it's a lot of fun. The sudden change that the movie undergoes from being a typical Tarantino-style film about two criminal brothers who take a family hostage while they make their way to Mexico to being an all-out, over-the-top gore-fest featuring vampire strippers is very strange and really doesn't make much sense, but if you're anything like me you really won't care as you sit back and enjoy the pure insanity that could only come from the mind of Quentin Tarantino as he writes a horror movie. Of course, part of the reason why this movie works as well as it does is that everything is handled with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that keeps the movie from taking itself too seriously. While the violence is incredibly graphic (this is easily the goriest vampire movie I've seen in years), it is slightly lessened by ridiculous sights such as the vampire band leader playing a guitar made from a human corpse, Cheech Marin tastefully telling customers of the vampire strip club about the variety of pu**y available, and the aforementioned codpiece gun.From watching this movie, it's pretty clear that no one involved was looking to make a cinematic masterpiece, but it was clear that everyone was having a blast. It's as violent, over-the-top, and pulpy as movies get, but I guarantee you probably won't see a movie like this for a long time.

I had a feeling that something was going to change when one of the characters in the strip bar threatened another character with a knife, only to be confronted with a gun that swivelled into place from a device attached around this man´s groin area. It was an incongrous moment and just didn´t fit in with the previous tempo of the movie as a whole. And, of course, we then had an infamous vampire orgy of blood and violence that equated the bloodletting in Peckinpah´s THE WILD BUNCH. I say equated but not bettered, for Peckinpah´s epic was stylish and exhuberant. Here it was way over the top and virtually portrayed as fun. But then again, looking at the movie as a whole, perhaps being way over the top was the point, paying homage not only to Hollywood but world cinema in general along the way. The Tarantino script tips it´s hat to the spaghetti westerns of Sergio Leone, Akira Kurosawa´sSamurai flicks, Romero´s Evil Dead and countless excursions into the living dead genre produced by the house of Hammer. We have here what Francois Truffaut sought out to achieve when he made ""TIREZ SUR LE PIANISTE"" (""Shoot the piano player""), namely ""..an explosion of genres...by mixing genres"". That classic flick was a mixture of gangster movie/love story/thriller/chase/musical etc.., that took the traditionally accepted notions of different film genres and fused them together into a coherent whole. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN most immediately fuses the thriller genre with the horror genre but many other genres are also in evidence, provided you are looking for them. Comedy is very much to the fore and I contend that this movie was made very tongue-in-cheek, very influenced by the tradition from whence it sprung.

273,Johnny0581,Tarantino + Rodriguez = Classic,9,24 February 2005,"Although it's not Tarantino's best work, this movie has to be one of the coolest movies ever in my opinion. As most people have noticed it is part gritty crime flick with witty dialogue and part popcorn horror flick. Robert Rodriguez and Tarantino really helped create a classic. George Clooney's Seth Gecko has to be one of the coolest movie characters in history, next to Samuel L. Jackson's Jules Winnfield, and Harvey Keitel's Mr.White. Clooney deserved the popularity and fame he received after making this movie. The supporting cast is great too, Harvey Keitel, always excellent in any role he plays, Juliette Lewis, gorgeous and also great, Cheech Marin, playing three characters, great as well, Salma Hayek, although a short role as one of the villains, pretty good too. The snake dance, along with her role in Desperado is what really launched her into Hollywood stardom. performance-wise she only said a few lines all to George Clooney right before he kills her which I think happened too fast and me and i'm sure most men wished Tarantino could've stretched Salma's character's life a bit more. The other complaint I have is that the body count was too high and I wished at least Sex Machine and Scott could've made it, maybe he could've saved Scott from getting bitten by his own father and all those vampires towards the end. I loved how Rodriguez brought the retractable penis gun back from ""Desperado"" but this time we actually see how it works. Rodriguez does a great job directing his movie, his camera work, especially in the first part of the movie is excellent. The make up, props and stunts, pretty good for a low-budget flick from 1996. It's not Oscar material, but it's still a classic in it's own right.",From Dusk Till Dawn
274,Oorag,this should never have been made,2,1 March 2000,"Tarantino must have been really bored one weekend when he wrote this trash. Unfortunately he later realized that anything he stuck his name to would make some money, so he dug it out and let people make it.
Bad bad bad!Before the vampires pop up the movie is like a cheap rehash of Reservoir Dogs with gun violence, a dark torture-death, and witty banter. Then it seems Tarantino squatted behind some bushes and used the remaining script pages as Charmins, because the the next two thirds of the movie felt like a group of wild monkeys throwing their own feces onto the screen.",From Dusk Till Dawn
275,Baghdaddy,Hit-And-Miss Tarantino Creates His Biggest Hit,10,15 June 2014,"Quentin Tarantino is a very hit-and-miss sort of Director for me, as sometimes his movies are incredible and sometimes they enter the realms of being too bizarre. This one was definitely a hit for me!The film starts giving background to the Gecko Brothers (played by Clooney and Tarantino), with Clooney having originally been caught and imprisoned for armed robbery. Tarantino breaks him out, but they need to find a way across the border to Mexico (a safe haven nicknamed ""El Rey""). Throughout their journey they encounter multiple obstacles from police patrols to dealing with a hostage situation. Eventually they take a former priest and his daughter and son hostage, in order to get across the border.Once they get across the border, the Gecko brothers decide to celebrate at a striptease establishment, and then from there things go to hell real quick as the staff turn out to be vampires!In typical Tarantino style, it becomes more apparent as the film goes on that his character suffers from serious mental illnesses, which ensues him to rape, and misconstrue reality. For me, the acting was incredible between Clooney and Tarantino. The action scenes, as well, are excellent, and the sudden change into a vampire survival movie is actually one that I enjoyed. The transition was not a boring one either, as there is constant action throughout the movie and the story line is consistent.This movie will always be one of Tarantino's best!",From Dusk Till Dawn

279,Cochese-6,"Great Atmosphere Makes ""FDTD"" one of the best of it's kind",9,26 January 2000,"To call ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" a B-movie would be wrong, although many consider it to be. I've been a huge Tarantino fan since ""Reservoir Dogs"" came out on video, and an equally big Rodriguez fan. If you know these directors beyond their films, you might know that they both share a passion for B-movie westerns and shoot-em-up gangster flicks. It seems that they combined both genres to help create ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" which at times SEEMS like a B-movie, only to add to it's feel. I was probably very lucky to not know what this movie was about before I saw it, which is rare. Therefore I was in for the surprise of my life when it turned suddenly from an intense ""fleeing robbers"" tale to a semi-horror movie. The whole film, from the very beginning has an EXCELLENT feel of creepiness to it. The film is excellently directed by Rodriguez, equipped with one of the best opening scenes I can rememeber.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)  In the end, ""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" is full of mystery in it's own way, with alot of questions for the viewer to ponder about the origins of the evil the Gecko brothers encountered, and the origin of the brothers themselves. I don't know about you guys, but those questions have always intrigued me. Maybe that's why ""FDTD"" has become one of my favorite movies since I first saw it in '96.",From Dusk Till Dawn
280,Raydio,Violent escapism ... entertaining,8,30 August 1999,"First and foremost, ""Dusk till dawn"" is not a film for those averse to violence. This is a VERY violent movie. That said, it's also quite entertaining, provided you are prepared to put aside any preconceptions about the storyline. The story revolves around the exploits of two extremely nasty brothers (Clooney and Tarantino), who will stop at nothing to escape justice, following a bank holdup. There are seemingly senseless acts of brutality committed from the outset, which serves to build a sense of revulsion for these two. After highjacking a family as hostages and fleeing into Mexico, the pair arrive at a truckers bar where the whole story takes a major turn. It's at this point that most people will decide to either love or hate this film. I chose the former. I've watched the DVD a few times now, and find the image quality to be excellent, apart from slight over coloration. The audio is equally satisfying. Sadly, there are very few additional features on the DVD. In summary, I recommend this film to fans of the action/horror genre ... just be prepared to check your incredulity at the door. 8/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
281,luckyfoshizzle,Keeps you entertained,8,30 March 2007,"Some say that this movie started out slow. And naturally for a movie that gives you so much insight into characters where most of them are going to die by the end of the movie I normally find it kind of boring and pointless, too. But not this one, in this movie the characters were pretty entertaining and I found the events leading up to the massacre to be quite entertaining also.There's the out of control sexual predator brother, his murderous ""only when need be"" older brother, a preacher that lost his faith, and two his teenagers. The only thing that really got on my nerves, though was how they tried to make the preacher man seem like he was a good guy bad ass when really all I thought it was was annoying. And then there was the plot hole of how this strip club managed to operate killing all truck drivers without none of them kicking their asses like they did in this movie and also why considering the fact that they were hauling semis why no one would go and look for them.Other than those two things I found this movie to be great! And would recommend it to anyone!",From Dusk Till Dawn

The first part of the film is awesome. We get a cool abduction story. Cool Characters and stuff. The second half is just brought into the story so abruptly it comes across terrible. George Clooneys character literally becomes a new Character when they reach the strip club. The movie is bad. THe whole vampire storyline is brought into the movie for no reason at all. I know that they wanted us to be excited by the sudden change in atmosphere, but it just plain sucked.

283,FordPrefect-42,I like most of this fun horror/comedy/thriller,7,5 August 2006,"I got From Dusk Till Dawn at a used DVD store for two bucks, and it was a good deal. This is really a mesh between a Quentin Tarantino crime picture and a Robert Rodriguez horror film.The first half involves Tarantino and George Clooney as Richard and Seth Gecko trying to get into Mexico and away from the FBI and the Texas Rangers since Richard broke Seth out of jail, helped him rob a bank and spilled a considerable amount of blood doing so. They kidnap Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis and first-timer Ernest Liu) and use their RV to get across the border. When over the border they go to the Titty Twister, a rowdy bar for bikers and truckers, where Richard and Seth plan on meeting their friend Carlos, sometime between dusk and dawn, so they can give him a cut of their loot. Little do they know, the Titty Twister is a front for a group of vampires who prey on unsuspecting truckers and bikers.From Dusk Till Dawn is a violent, campy, and mostly entertaining movie. Tarantino wrote the screenplay and does a stellar job as Richard Gecko, and Rodriguez directed it which makes it feel a bit like Desperado and Pulp Fiction thrown together with some campy horror.The main things I liked about this movie were the actors. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are really convincing as two criminal brothers. When Seth finds the dead, raped body of a woman who was supposed to be their hostage, he asks Seth if it's his fault and if he (Richard) thinks that's what he (Seth) is like. I also liked Harvey Kietel as a minister who seems to have lost his faith and Juliette Lewis, who I usually find annoying, as his daughter. Plus, Salma Hayek is ultra-sexy as an exotic dancer.I preferred the first half of the movie to the semi-campy gore-invested second half. The vampires look like a cross between zombies and vampires, which I don't think works very well, and the special effects are obviously fairly low budget, plus I'm not a huge gory-horror movie fan. While the effects are fairly cheesy, I got the feeling they weren't supposed to look very real anyway since their are a lot of jokes and visual gags. A group talk about ways to kill vampires is amusing and pokes fun at vampire movie clichés and Juliette Lewis has a funny scene where she is unsure about stabbing a possibly bitten trucker.Overall I'd give From Dusk Till Dawn seven stars of of ten, it's a entertaining movie with some fun performances and an original story, but the effects are awkward since it's hard to tell whether they are purposely cheesy or just low budget. Check it out if you get the chance.",From Dusk Till Dawn
284,dillon09,Absolutely blood sucking great,10,17 November 2000,"The combination of Taratino's writng and Rodgriguez's direction make this a winner. Some slated it for not knowing what it wanted to be a con escape thriller or a horror, but to me this sets it apart from the usual vampire flicks. The casting is wicked, Harvey Keitel (brilliant as ever) Juliet Lewis, Cheech Marin (brilliant in all 3 roles), Tarantino, Salma Hayek (Hubba Hubba) and of course George Clooney, who for me can do no wrong. Since his departure from ER he seems to have gone from strength to strength, and sad muppet that I am I even liked him as Batman.The script is a bit predictable at times maybe but some of the one liners are great, and the interaction between the characters is well done, no-one particularly steals the show (apart from Hayek when she does that dance) and Tarantino and Clooney as the two convict brothers are really good.Brilliant film, that's different enough to make it interesting and as with any film that has Tarantino's influence it has a stonkin' soundtrack.",From Dusk Till Dawn
285,humpback,great twisted tale,10,1 January 2000,"Probably one of the best and most innovative movies of the '90s - both from a cinematic angle and storywise. Yes it is based on a script by Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez, both not easily accepted as 'high-art' directors and by the Academy. Who cares ? Just ask yourself as to how many times since Hitchcock's 'Psycho' has one seen a plot jerk as unexpectedly into a totally different vein as in this movie. For those who complain that a gritty gangster story suddenly turns into a fantastic horror saloon brawl - that is exactly what makes this movie so good. Its unexpected, catches you on the wrong foot, and rearranges all the set constellations from the first part of the movie. What else ? Great, tense and very memorable dialogues, eye-catching locations ( I just keep spotting new details in the Titty Twister every time I watch the movie ) and some fine acting ( yes, even Juliette Lewis. One does hardly ever have to gripe about Harvey Keitel, George Clooney or Cheech Marin. Tarantino himself is just looney.... And Salma Hayek is one sexy mistress of the night).Good music score, too - it greatly helps conveying the mood and speed of the individual scenes, without becoming bombastic or boring. Same about the camera work, including the flashbacks/hallucinations incurred by Tarantino's character, points of view for a lot of shots and the cutting.And even if you don't care about the incredible handiwork - it's just roaringly funny and dead-pan (check the quotes section !). Just be warned, that it is not meant for the easily insulted, sensitive and romantically inclined crowd - one has to be able to stand the gore, fantastic/horror aspects ( a friend of mine never got over the fact, that 'vampires' suddenly showed up in a 'gangster'-movie ) rough language and several crude jokes, so any artsy fans of Harvey Keitel will probably get the shock of their lives .

287,rubenvanbergen,"Concept: 9, execution: 6",7,13 April 2013,"I sat down to this movie with no preconceptions whatsoever, as had been recommended to me. This turned out to be very good advice, because it makes the twist in the middle a complete surprise, and therefore all the more enjoyable. (It is for this reason that I'm giving a spoiler warning, as even knowing there is a twist might rob people of that experience.) Essentially you're thrown from one movie into a completely different one, with the main characters as the only thread holding the two together. Almost the entire plot from the first 30 minutes is rendered irrelevant, which I thought was a great idea. Usually, you sort of know where a story is going. If the point is for the protagonist to travel to a volcano and throw a ring into it, you know they are going to be successful. You have some suspense of disbelief that allows you to still experience some fear when a perilous situation presents itself, but at a more ""meta"" level you know what Frodo isn't going to die in the first book/film.This movie takes that expectation and punches it in the face. Unfortunately, though, the concept is not carried to a satisfying end. After the monsters are let loose, there are about 10 minutes where the movie is able to ride the absurdity of this gear shift, but then finds itself stuck with a bunch of vampires to get rid of, and a plot to tie a knot in. And through the insistence to pay homage to cheap gore movies, the tension arcs that were built up in the first half of the movie are deflated without pay-off, and the relationships between the characters are essentially reset. This robs the movie of a connection between the two stories, as well as a proper resolution. Still, it's an entertaining 90 minutes and a must-see cult classic.",From Dusk Till Dawn

While George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino's acting jobs were utterly horrendous, Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel, as usual, were fantastic. However, they could not save this movie. It has an incredibly thin plot, and no character development. I must say the censors at Fox did a great job taking out all the breasts and swearing. I seem to remember Clooney saying three four letter words for every normal word. And the name of the bar on TV was the Kitty Twister, and I seem to remember it being named something *slightly* different when I saw it on video. If it really did have that slightly different name in the uncensored movie, one must really give credit to Fox' censors, as even the LOGO for the bar said Kitty Twister. From Dusk Til Dawn is a bad movie. Unfortunately it takes itself far too seriously to even be laughably bad.

It never tires me, it's always a joy to watch.This is a Vampire movie with an attitude, and humorous dialogue. George Clooney is not my favorite actor, but his performance is good in this one. Robert Roderiguez of the SPYkids movies directs this Horror Adventure.Seth Gecko (Clooney), and Richard Gecko (Tarantino) play Two Murderous Criminal Brothers on the run from the law, and their only chance of escape is moving to Mexico (a place that is now full of wanted people in the Movie world). To devise a quick route to their destination, they take hostages, a Trailer-travelling Family- Jacob Fuller (Keitel)as a preacher who lost his faith, his Son Scott Fuller (Liu), and his Daughter Kate (Lewis).The delusional Richard takes an obsessive interest in Kate and this distracts him from his duties. By luck they reach the Mexican border and force the Fuller family to go into a Strip bar called the TITTY TWISTER for a meeting of a crime boss.Santanico Pandemonium played by the sexy Salma Hayek (who is now playing Frida) does a belly dance and shows off her curves, I don't fancy girls, but somehow Salma doing that serpent dance made me twist my sexuality for 2 minutes. That is the most seductive scene in movie history, or of my History!!! And I don't mind watching it all over again.....and again.It's not long before the Gecko Brothers got themselves into trouble, as a result Richard's hand was shot and bloody, turning frenzied Salma into a lizard-like blood Sucker and attacked and bitten Richard, who becomes a vampire; Seth had to end his brother's life. Seth is angered and retailiates, by begging the survivors including the Fullers to fight for their lives, and the blood bath begins.They are fantastic one-lines coming from the Actors that flow more than the River Nile, for example Vampire Musicians were on stage, Sex machine (Savini) said to Frost (Williamson) 'let's kill that F****** Band' and the blood Sucking singer sticks a finger gesture 'F*** you and Good Night' *Kaboom* the band blows up.

They just have to survive for a night at the rendezvous point, which turns out to be a bar on the brink of hell, populated with Vampires.When you first look at From Dusk Till Dawn, you already it's a horror film. However, when you actually watch it, it's very different. The first 70 minutes of the movie are horror-less, and develops what seems to be an interesting Tarantino-like crime story. As this theme continues for most of the film, you start to think, ""Wait a minute, this would be a great film without the horror."" It seems, whilst trying to write a horror-flick, Tarantino actually created another epic crime movie, and added a less-than-average horror plot to it at the end. However, for what's it worth, the movie is none-the-less, great. Clooney and Tarantino play the Gecko brothers. Two thief's and outlaws who are fresh from a bank robbery and on the run from the start. Clooney is Seth, a cool acting, fast talking and quick thinking thief who, along with his brother Richie, a sex offender-psycho-rapist (played by Quentin himself) kidnap a family and force them to carry them across the border to Mexico. Seth tells the father of the family, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) that he'll let him and his two kids go safely, after they wait peacefully at an organised rendezvous point for Seth's connection, Carlos. However, the club is a hell hole ran by a gang of ruthless Vampires.The plot is, actually, not that bad. The main problem I have with the film is how the Vampires were portrayed. They look more to me like Zombies. Each Vamp looks different, and random monster spurt up now and again which lowers the, well, coolness of the film. Even Quentin himself said they looked like Zombies. Apart from that, the script is awesome. In fact, the film looks like it was directed by Quentin himself. Robert Rodriguez did a good job in living up to his previous film, Desperdo.If you look hard enough, you'll also see many Tarantino trademarks and references to his other films. Sort of like an added bonus, really. Oh, and look out for the dance scene with Salma Hayek...Overall: A great film with a cast of talented and strong actors, an excellent script from Tarantino, and superb direction from Rodriguez. Not a masterpiece, but it could have been close without the zombie-styled-vampires and mindless horror fighting. Still, great. (4/5)",From Dusk Till Dawn
304,ABechtel,A contemptible mess,1,5 July 1999,"This is a truly repugnant film on many levels, but perhaps mostly in the character played by Tarantino. A brain-dead thug, he has *no* redeeming qualities, but presumably the movie wants us to root for him and the Clooney character. Forget about it.If you must see this, make sure you VCR's fast-forward function is working well. You'll need it during the bloody and boring final act.",From Dusk Till Dawn
305,ghostface18,"Everybody Be Cool, You Be Cool",8,9 May 2002,"On the MTV Movie Awards, George Clooney won for Breakthrough Performance. Not only do I stand by this win, but because of From Dusk Till Dawn, Clooney has become my favorite actor.  It's true that in the middle, it is a bit slow, but the beginning scene (one of the best opening movie sequences I have seen on a movie) and the entire T*tty Twister scene (the main focus of the movie) are action packed.  Even when there is no action, with the help of the four actors (Clooney, Tarantino, Keitel, and Lewis), the film is still interesting.  Note:  This movie has extreme pervasive language and EXTREME gore (because it is a vampire movie).  You also cannot take the story seriously.  If you get passed the language, gore, and basic story, you should have a fun time with this movie.  Honestly, it is one of my favorite movies!!!!!!!",From Dusk Till Dawn

Rodriguez's direction is perfect and all the performances are terrific. All the roles are perfectly casted and add to the incredible atmosphere of the film. The film is clever because its two different types of films combined. A chase\cops & robbers film and a horror film. In the first half, you begin to like the characters and then, when the plot twist hits you like a sledgehammer, you are worried about the characters and you go through the same horror they are going through. All in all, From Dusk Till Dawn is a very classy film, with great makeup and a blistering soundtrack.

Instead I got a messy horror show suitable for teenagers at a drive-in.Sometimes the violence is too violent, and to me, what happens to the hostage in the hotel is over the line.Secondly, the notion of somebody who has accepted Jesus then turning into a vampire is just plain wrong. If you've accepted Christ, then greater who is in you than who is in the world - period! Scripturally this movie is not correct, and SOMEBODY on that film crew should have noticed and corrected that.

Cheech is effortlessly hilarious from what I remember, but you'll notice he doesn't fit at all. The rest of the movie takes a quick turn to stupidville immediately after that. It's not done in a funny or entertaining way either. It's just lame.For the sake of laziness I save the basic synopsis to the other reviews, but I want to point out that this movie actually had quite a lot of real potential in the beginning. Keitel's character and his loss of faith, his love for his kids, etc. could've played against Clooney and Tarantino's bond and it would've been compelling despite Tarantino's inability to act.Unless it's entertaining for you to watch a movie get sabotaged half-way through you should avoid this one. If only the first half had been so terrible--there was actually a touch of substance for once in one of Quentin's movies, I should've known it wouldn't last--I would've turned it off then and not wasted my time.The ""4"" rating is mostly due to Cheech Marin's 30 second onslaught of hilarity and the acting chops of all but Quentin in the beginning. They're so good at their craft that I actually thought for a minute it was an attempt to really say something.",From Dusk Till Dawn

I was pleasantly surprised to find out it was a gory, vampire, splatter-fest. The movie starts out like its just going to be a couple of bad-asses running from the cops, tearing it up along the way. Then, after the best part of the movie (the snake dance), the movie takes a strange turn and turns into something totally not what you expected. This movie is heavily influenced by both Tarantino and Rodriguez and the movie is a direct reflection of their styles, which I believe are very similar. I really cant think of any characters that I didn't like. Everyone was cool , the makeup was decent, and the pace of the movie keeps you interested at all times. This is a really cool movie, and I'm really glad I bought this years ago. I wish they would release a better DVD with more features and 5.1 .

318,jakeandelwood,The Thin Line Between Suspense and Horror,8,17 June 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** From Dusk Till Dawn is one of those movies that surprised the audience big time. Starting out as a real suspense/thriller the audience will be taken to the edge of their seat.But then half way the film the plot suddenly turns 180 degrees and we are in the middle of a great, funny, gore, horror movie. For those who didn't know what to expect it was a real shock. ""How the hell can a great thriller like this turn into a cheap horror flick?"" they must have thought.
Well the answer is simple. Because it is a Rodriguez-Tarantino production which proofs ""you never can tell"" what will happens next.When I saw this one at the Cinema in the Netherlands, just a few people knew what they were going into. But most of them had no idea what to expect. So during the break (In the Netherlands most theaters have a 15 minute break halfway a movie) people in the Lobby were talking about this great thriller. The break started at the moment that the brothers, together with the camping family, reached the Titty Twister, just before they went in. Everybody was wondering what the twist would be. But I bet that even their wildest imagination didn't come close. After the interval the movie went on and within a few minutes everyone changed into vampires. Not long after that most of the audience walked out of the theater. They could not believe what was happening to the story. Such a sick twist. How was this possible? The people that stayed were in for a big treat. And at the end we all cheered and clapped our hands for a while. This was great.The director took us from a great suspense movie into an even greater horror/comedy. He showed us that the distance between the two genres is in fact nothing more than a thin line. For those of you who think the same way about this great picture, you should buy the DVD Collector's Edition. It's full of great special features (incl Full Tilt Boogey, a full feature film about the making of this picture). I rewarded this movie a 10 out of 10 because I still enjoy it every time I see it",From Dusk Till Dawn

Check. 2) Violent deaths? Check 3) Ear splitting gunshot explosions? Check.But when we were just about to unravel the characters: the director and screenplay writer decided to bring out a boner and turn the movie into a sad hackneyed horror comedy movie?

I'm going to forgive and never try to think of her and this movie together ever again. It fits the Tarantino cult genre and as Tarantino was one of the screen writers I just have a few question: Really Quentin, vampires? Did you completely run out of ideas or just need the money? And its like two different movies! It takes them forever to get to the bar; and then it takes them forever to get out! I guess there are some props to the special effects team but that's it. And why is George Clooney in this? Hey George! Did you lose a bet? Tax lien on your Italian villa? Pets were being held hostage? I liked exactly 10 seconds of that movie.

321,imnotjohncandy,Yes...You Must See This.,10,3 May 2015,"Hello my beloved children of the night, it is I, your beloved monstermaster and I have returned - it's time for me to take you back to a time where vampires were actually awesome. That time being 1996, and the movie in question...From Dusk Till Dawn.I know I already talked about this movie during Halloween last year, but....I thought it would be an awesome idea to talk about this movie in full, of course everybody I know has seen this movie so I am not going to go over the whole plot, but I am going to go over why I think this movie is awesome. For starters, this is how I think a vampire movie should be, it is scary and intense but also exotic and intriguing! It's become one of my personal favorites, so much so I am becoming obsessed with it - i'm even starting to dream about it, you could say that in my dreams I am a regular at the Titty Twister, no i'm not a vampire yet, but I feel I might become one very soon. I even have a fan-made Grimm Wesen based on the vampires in this movie! I love how this movie is different than your typical run-of-the-mill horror flick, it starts off as a typical Tarantino-esque crime caper only for it to become a kickass horror movie in the second half! It took me by surprise! Kudos to Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino for their teamwork here.This movie is one no horror fan should be without, as it is an absolute must for horror movie fans, vampire movies, and badass movies in general. It's movies like this and Bram Stoker's Dracula that make me wish i was a vampire myself, I just have a thing for bloodthirsty monster types and monster-girls. It's also movies like this and Sleepy Hollow that make me wish I was the one being bitten or kissed like that. The same goes for Bram Stoker's Dracula, and you can't fault me for the latter because the Hessian in Sleepy Hollow is Christopher Walken and when Walken is on screen you don't question anything and just let Walken do the rest! Also you cannot fault me for wanting to get bitten by Santanico Pandemonium because Salma Hayek is a goddess, and i'd gladly surrender to her and be her willing slave anytime. Hey! It was that sexy dance that did it for me.That sexy dance scene.... by the way is...still impressive even to this day, even more impressive considering Salma Hayek is afraid of snakes and had to be hypnotized in order to overcome her fear. I'd let her bite me anyday! I'd let her bite me anyday! And you can quote me on that! There's so many characters in this movie to love, including the Gecko brothers, the Fullers, Sheriff Earl, Frost, Razor Charlie but I think my personal favorite is this guy here. Sex Machine. This man is one badass mamajamma. Just look at him. How many people do you know that have a crotch-gun? No one.This guy is AWESOME! I wanna hang out with him! One of the best scenes and also one of the funniest moments comes in the scene where we see Sex Machine transforming bit by bit into a vampire, it just cracks me up - especially when he covers his mouth after his fangs start forming, and his right hand changes to become all monster-like with long claw-like fingernails and then his left hand changes and then he hides his hands behind his back. And he's completely unaware of it at first as is everyone else. It's got my two favorite kind of TFs (transformations) in them - the 'Bit By Bit' variety where a person changes one part at a time, and the 'Completely Unaware He/She is Transforming' kind where the transformee doesn't realize he/she is transforming. It's no wonder Aardman paid tribute to this scene in Curse Of The Wererabbit.What moment moved me to tears? I'll tell ya.It has to be when Richie dies, I know he's a psychopath - but that moment made me cry a little. *sobs* Richie's gone? NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Oh well, he'll come back.. but here's the slight hiccup, he won't be human anymore and he'll probably be after your blood, Seth - just a head's up.As for the funniest moment? Like I mentioned earlier, it was the scene with Sex Machine transforming into a vampire, oh and Frost's reaction to being bitten by him as well, funny as hell and one of my personal favorite scenes. (Frost: He f***in' bit me! F****' BIT ME) That scene cracked me up to no end! It is a pretty awesome movie and it is also incredibly badass, especially with the action and crime elements, the vamps are very intimidating and also intriguing. Not to mention the ever alluring Salma Hayek as the vampiress Santanico Pandemonium, who...is in fact quite hypnotic. I'll admit that the vampire with the snapping mouth on her stomach is a bit much, but why quibble? Fun fact: The color of the vampires blood is green because the MPAA has issues with it being red, they have absolutely no problem with blood - but they don't like it because it's red. It was indeed Tarantino's idea to give the vampires green blood to avoid the film from getting a rating higher than R and to get it past the censors.",From Dusk Till Dawn
322,Dark Scribe,"Splatter fest, but entertaining",7,25 March 2000,"Although the gratuitous violence and gore detract a little from it, I really enjoyed this gem from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Admittedly the plot is a little far fetched, but it makes enough fun of itself that you can laugh at it easily. The main thing I noticed about this film was the acting. It would have been easy to lose sight of acting amidst the sex, violence and gore, but for me it shone through the guts as glory. George Clooney delivers one of the best performances if not the best that he has shown on the silver screen, and he was well backed up by Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Cheech Marin (3 in 1 guy). Good performances by Danny Trejo, the delectable Salma Hayek, and the biker guy made this a really fun ride. Clooney's delivery of his many one liners was superb, truly excellent. The fight scenes were also well done, although as mentioned already the splatter was a little over the top in places.

325,eeluksw,Excess From Two Excessive Filmmakers,8,25 November 2019,"Quentin Tarantino, true to his episodic nature of storytelling, writes a film that is the godfather of 2007's Grindhouse double feature. Robert Rodriguez picks up the other half, and when the studio pressure is off, the energy he brings to these midnight movies is on a level of its own.From Dusk Till Dawn is a combination of the two then-young talents worth seeing. You probably couldn't place it at the top of either filmmaker's work, but there are two many well-executed elements that mean you shouldn't dismiss it. Much of that has to do with the strength of George Clooney as the lead. He's wonderful. It kind makes me hate how he has been typecast out of foul-mouthed, rotten roles since. He plays a handsome psychopath almost too well. Quentin Tarantino himself, in a rare acting role, is equally as strong. For all the obnoxious QT worship that's gone on since his debut, I don't ever hear anyone commend his acting ability. Granted, this is his only real lead part, but his delivery, his emoting, it's all pitch-perfect.The first half of the film is not anything ground breaking, but you pair Rodriguez's direction, the lead performances, and Tarantino's dialogue all with some great cinematography and I would happily watch two hours of the Gecko brothers failing upward.Except, there's that twist halfway through. While I love this experiment, it doesn't happen without some noticeable hits to the tone, pacing, and writing. It doesn't feel like a coincidence that once Tarantino's character bows out, the film's quality takes a bit of a turn for the worse. Harvey Keitel, who up to this point has been doing his best with a conflicted man of God, also appears to lose interest when the vampires come out. Everything then just turns into a tongue-in-cheek frenzy, and while the comedic tone still works, it contrasts with the first half of the film that was entertaining but not outright goofy.However, it's still a blast to see so much sustained mayhem within a single location. The practical effects are suitably nasty, and the spirit of the film is still flying high, in the form of a bat.I should take more issue with how much the film kind of gives up what made the first half fun in its second, but it creates a whole new kind of fun. Just know that my rating is largely based on the strength of the first hour or so. Your mileage may vary.",From Dusk Till Dawn

The acting isn't that bad but there are a few mistakes when the shooting starts with the vampires and they seem to have managed to keep clean shirts on.

There are a couple of murders involved and Richie (Tarantino) rapes and murders the hostage that they had been holding as a bargaining chip for the police. This motivates them to find new hostages, queue The Fuller family, and head to Mexico to meet with a mysterious crime lord Carlos. After having their Rv searched at the border, they successfully reach their desired destination and encounter an eccentric and raucous bar, The Titty Twister.They have no idea what they are getting themselves into...OH NO!!! After experiencing the outrageously sexy snake dance by the appallingly beautiful Salma Hayek, everything goes haywire. There's gore and vampires produced through simply dreadful special effects and the body count needlessly spirals out of control. After several minutes of muddled crap where bodies fly everywhere and ugly vampires seemingly outnumber the humans, the humans breakthrough thanks to the sunlight. Yay! Spare me.This film started of decently well, I thoroughly enjoyed the turn of Clooney, an immensely gifted actor, who portrayed ruthlessness, sadistic intentions yet feasible levels of negotiability whilst Harvey Keitel is typically impressive as a worried Dad. As for Tarantino, it was lucky that he died halfway through the film, simply because as a director he is nothing short of a genius, as an actor, he is useless.Robert Rodriguez perfectly pulls the plug on this films potential with an extraordinarily long sequence of tedious vampire slaying, excessive blood and guts and an easy ending. Oh well, what could have been. But what else can we expect from the man who offended us with catastrophes such as Spy Kids.5/10. Laughable second half to the movie. Tut tut,",From Dusk Till Dawn
334,ocarina619,"Entertaining, Quirky but not the greatest.",7,11 February 2004,"I found that this movie almost offered too much to be true when I first read about it.  Tarantino alone would make me watch this movie, not considering the draw power that Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis have over me in terms of other great films they have both been in.  I was unsure of how George Clooney would act in a role written by Tarantino, but to my surprise he handled it very well.  I felt that Clooney and Keitel pulled together the entire film as it was dangering close to falling apart.I enjoyed Tarantino's screen play and his acting as well as they both offered a unique style of quirky humour that only Tarantino can deliver. The movie did alter extremely suddenly at one point, which I knew was approaching but I was disappointed as I had begun to like the charismatic start to the film and the dialogue of the characters.
I'd say that this film is entertaining, its definately worthy of a few watches but I'm yet to be convinced on both Vampire movies and movies directed by Robert Rodriguez.  Very good, but not great.",From Dusk Till Dawn
335,JimmyG100,Second... greatest... vampire... movie... EVER!,8,9 June 2005,"Second greatest cus let's face it you can't beat the original Dracula. You've got Robert Rodriguez, directing a story by Quentin Tarantino, in the style of Sam Raimi, with a plot akin to a George A. Romero zombie movie. How can it go wrong? It can't! Hell this film is a veritable orgasm of all that is great about horror and crime films. And don't take this for a simple vampire flick either, make no mistake this film is hard core with its crime storyline too. The entire first half of the film is exactly something you'd expect from Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, heavy dialog, gruesome violence, bad guys you love to hate, and bad guys you just love. But once the fangs come out all bets are off. Think of Night of the Living Dead, but in Mexico, with Vampires instead of Zombies, and with much more innovative weapons. Man you think Uma taking on the Crazy 88's was intense, Crazy 88's weren't blood sucking demons that could only be killed by impaling them through the heart with a huge chunk of wood. If you love vampire or zombie films, if you thought Pulp Fiction and Resiviour Dogs were just a ingenious as I did, if you loved Rodriguez's Mariachi series or even if all you know about him is how awesome a job he did with Sin City, you owe it to yourself to seek out this gem of a film. I guarantee you will not be disappointed.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Hard to envisage them as brothers though unless one of the parents was totally different to the other.The second part is a horror film with Clooney, Keitel etc taking on a bunch of vampires.Overall fairly good as a bit of mindless entertainment. I enjoyed the second half more than the first.Decent performances by all the leads but hardly stretching.That dance by Salma though ... WOW",From Dusk Till Dawn
337,Jonthan22,"I like this, but I don't know why....",7,23 February 2006,"Dusk stars George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino as Seth and Richard Gecko, two professional thieves, also brothers, who are on the run from the FBI in Richita, Texas.The opening 15 minutes is as cool and entertaining as you will likely find in any movie as we are shown Seth (Clooney), the older brother, a thief and scoundrel, but deep down an honorable man who wants nothing more than for he and his brother to get across the Mexican border with their stolen loot, so they can retire in paradise. And the younger brother, Richie (Tarantino), an unhinged psychopath and r@pist who enjoys inflicting pain and death on those unfortunate enough to cross his path.The first half of this movie plays like a psychological thriller, as Seth tries to contain his brothers psychopathic tendencies long enough to get them across the border to safety. When an Ex-Priest (Harvey Keitel) and his two children Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis, as white trash as ever, and Ernest Liu) stumble across the Gecko brothers, they are taken hostage and are forced to smuggle the brothers over the Mexican border in their motor home.The second half of this movie then becomes an action horror as the Geckos and their captives take refuge in a Mexican bar named the Titty Twister. Unfortunately, the bar is full of crazed Vampire monsters with a lust for blood and the brothers are forced to team with their hostages if they are to make it out alive.Now I DO like this movie, though for the life of me I don't know why! The acting is good, and the action scenes (Pre-Vampire) are well done. The sudden shift in genre halfway through the movie doesn't sit right with me though, as much as it is a novel idea, I feel it came way out of left field and it left me shocked when I first saw the movie.There are some cheesy moments of dialogue, mostly from Clooney, too. The movie, like my opinion of it, cannot seem to make up its mind.Bottom line though, the movie does entertain and Salma Hayeks sexy dance is worth at least one viewing of the film on its own. Also, look out for several cameo appearances from Cheech Marin (of Cheech and Chong fame) playing several minor characters.

It's rare to see a movie that so perfectly balances compelling and downright B movie hilarity. Quentin Tarantino is a great writer, and Robert Rodriguez is the perfect director for a movie like this. George Clooney is great at being the rational center of the movie, and I think Tarantino wrote a perfect role for himself. I know he got a razzie nom, but I think that was just for people to hate on him, because this movie is SUPPOSED to be a little ridiculous. I love watching this movie with people who have no idea what it's about, and listening to them guess all the way to the point where Salma Hayek goes full vamp.

Not their best performances but they do a pretty good job. Dialogue is not great, editing is average. However, you will be pleasantly surprised by the makeup effects. My advice, have fun with this movie. It is very entertaining, just sit back and enjoy it.For the horror fans, you will absolutely love it! The movie starts off a little slow, but once you get to about the 40 minutes mark, things escalate quickly. LIke I stated before, you will be amazed by the makeup effects in this film. The vampires are real cool and may be some of the coolest vampires ever in a movie. Also horror fans, you will notice makeup/ special effects legend Tom Savini has a role in this film! For what he does, he is great and you will definitely get a kick out of it. Another thing viewers should note going into this movie it is more of an action movie than horror, but there is also a little dark comedy in it. It all actually meshes very well.Overall 'From Dusk Til Dawn' is a very entertaining movie. Awesome makeup effects and lots of creative stuff in this film!

The first half is the tale of the 2 criminal brothers Seth and Richie Gecko, while the other half of course is the vampire homage to horror films. Some people like one half better than the other.

I actually quite liked it while I watched it, but then the end came. Clooney and Lewis on the parking lot before the Titty Twister, and the thinking set in. The film made absolutely no sense, and I don't think I will watch it again, which is probably the worst thing I can think of saying about a film. I know that a lot of people think of Quentin Tarantino as a good author--well, i don't believe he is. A good film script consists of roughly two parts--a plot and the dialogues. Tarantino is good on the latter, no doubt there, but none of his films have a really good plot. Pulp Fiction was a handful of filmed short stories thrown together, without much sense if they would fit together. From Dusk till Dawn was worse--the pulp-fiction-like first half and the vampire slaughter fest in the second just didn't fit together. At one point I thought I spotted some kind of message in this piece of crap--when Harvey Keitel's character revealed his loss of faith and had to believe to go out and fight the vampires, but Tarantino never worked it out. And the end I felt cheated--I have lost two hours of life which won't come back. There's nothing in this film i can recommend--not even the special effects were really good. They were technically OK, but the design was just crap, senseless, and not thought through, just like the rest of it.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Nothing remarkable like acting, directing, scenario, but I watched it about twice and would definitely watch it again.

I think that it contains all the elements of a fun, exciting and re watchable movie.The acting is my favorite part of the movie. Clooney is so bad an actor that he's fun to watch. He actually is unable to say lines in the script, and they leave the bad takes in the final cut of the movie. He also has some very memorable and campy lines, such as ""Okay ramblers, let's get rambling"", ""okay hard drinkers, lets drink hard, I'm buying"" and of course, ""Okay Vampire Killers, lets kill some f****in' vampires!"" Tarantino was much better an actor, and his character had many dimension which made him worth watching. Keitel was awesome as always, deeply philosophical and really bringing life to his character, and all the others played their bit parts with enthusiasm and humor.The plot is pretty bizarre, but it just works. The first part deals with the escape of two outlaw brothers. They killed a lot of people and are looking to escape to Mexico, and kidnap Keitel and his family to smuggle them over the border. They arrive at the rendez-vous point, the titty twister bar, and wait for the arrival of Carlos, their escort. Pretty soon all hell breaks loose and the survivors band together to fight a horde of vampires who have been running this bar.The gruesome violence, which is even more graphic in the DVD is just awesome and fun to watch. Homages are paid to many great movies, like the wild bunch, and the special effects are just spectacular. The dialog from the survivors is just priceless, from when they discuss how to kill vampires to when The Hammer tells his Nam flashback, to the stunning finale and final goodbyes.I cannot think of a more bizarre, fun, and deep popcorn thriller. Highly recommended to any fan of vampires, action, Tarantino, or clooney's god awful acting (which works for the movie). 10 out of 10",From Dusk Till Dawn
349,marcus40mast,Starts off well and then gets better,8,11 September 2001,"This film, if nothing else, deserves high marks if only for its complete tounge-in-cheek attitude to the whole Vampire scenario. The start of the film is fairly cool, with a good introduction to the two characters who will play a big part in our adventure, but then it kind of dies down until they reach the...ahem...nightclub.Then the action really gets going and the humour gets more and more dark. ""Sex-Machine""'s machine gun is an absolute show stealer and the attitude of the Preacher's young daughter, expertly played by Julliet Lewis, steals the show from Clooney. Clooney's whole attitude is just superb and I had heard reports of bad acting in the film, but I find that hard to believe. Tarantino gives a wonderful, if slightly disturbing, performance as Clooney's perverted brother and Harvey Keitel is good as the preacher.

It is all of a sudden af vampire movie. A pointless narrative that has nothing to do with the first part of the story, the characters development feels forced and idiotic.

Along the way they cause destruction and death, and take a preacher and his kids hostage.

Girls if you are looking for Clooney to be like he usually is, sappy and handsome, you will be disappointed. This in my opinion is Clooney's most unique role, he is frankly a bastard in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". If you are looking for a amazing movie that you will fall in love with, this might not be it.

I don't know if the subtlety needed to come from Clooney toning it down a little, or Tarantino writing something less corny.

BUT when a man in the Titty Twister (The name of the vampire's bar. Trust me it gets worse) reveals a machine gun charity belt that he was wearing, I knew the movie was about go downhill fast. Several times during the film, Clooney and company will be standing in a circle and the vampires will just wait to be attacked several times so don't expect to ever feel worried about a character dying that you care about (mainly because you are not given much reason to care about them anyway). The band of vampires continues to play songs while everyone is brawling, and somehow a green blade made Tarantino turn into a vampire.The second half of this movie plays out like a sci-fi channel movie, and the first half plays out like a Tarantino film, with much thanks to Tarantino himself for that. The big picture is that the film is largely forgettable due to its change in tone for the second half. A big thanks to Quentin Tarantino for taking the great aspects of this movie, and making his movies continue that tone throughout the entire films instead of jump ship for gore and vampires.The verdict is, From Dusk till Dawn is still a film worth watching, but if you haven't seen Tarantino's film yet, I would suggest watching all of them before this one. Overall, the film is average. There are some really good aspects, but unfortunately some really bad aspects as well that even the good ones out. 5/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
367,chmstewart,Disappointing Tarantino Flick,5,21 July 2019,"While his films are often hokey, this is by far Tarantino's weakest work. It starts off somewhat promising especially with Clooney in a very un-Clooney like heel role. But it ends up going into the realm of a Sharknado or Nicolas Cage type demon flick.
It's B movie entertainment with corny gore and cornier dialogue. If you're expecting something as polished as the Kill Bill movies, you'll be thoroughly disappointed. If you're looking for a cheesy horror that's high on exploding vampires and evil strippers (Selma Hayak) then this will fit the bill. Unlike Selma, this film is certainly not anywhere near being a 10.",From Dusk Till Dawn
368,mr_Goodbomb,Fantastic,10,4 April 2011,"I wanted to respond to the current top review, ""True Tarantino."" First of all, to call it ""true Tarantino"" and never mention Rodriquez is either misleading or ill-informed. Tarantino wrote the script and played one of the lead characters, yes, but he did not direct the film. He actually denied various subsequent levels of involvement with the film in order to concentrate on his portrayal of Richard Gecko after completing the script. I believe Rodriquez deserves as much credit here as Tarantino, and after the second half of the film, KNB Effects deserves as much as either of them.That said, to say that the effects weren't ""very good"" is just silly. While the effects can often be campy and over the top to the point of being unrealistic, it's a monster film, and it treats the effects as such. These aren't your everyday ""actor with false teeth"" vampires, these are Evil Dead II style demons, creatures that resemble less Lugosi and more The Thing, mutated, weird, and disturbing, and more concerned with entertainment than realism. You must also consider that some of these effects were highly functional, not just simple makeup jobs but interactive builds that sprayed fluid, changed shapes, and moved about. You must also consider that this is a 15+ year old film. If you're looking for visual effects that blend practical makeups with CG elements in every shot, or worse, nothing but CG for ""effects,"" then you're looking for the wrong thing here. Aside from a few blends, melts, and effect fades, everything you see was done in front of the camera, in person, for real, and it looks that was. None of the effects look like something you couldn't reach out and touch, and they all live up to some of the best and highest regarded horror and scifi effects created for film. I'd love to see what the OP thought was a ""good"" special effect.All of this aside, this is a fantastic film. The first has is engaging, interesting, and unique, tugging you along for the ride in a familiar fashion to other Tarantino scripts in a decidedly Tex-Mex Rodriquez style. It slows down only to let you get involved with the characters, and is at no point boring or dismissible. If you take someone who has never seen this film, and doesn't know what it's about, and sit them down to watch it, the range of expressions and reactions you'll get to the mid-movie vampire shock are worth repeat viewings with a new audience. After the shift in story arc, the following scenes are fun, entertaining as hell, and right up the gore/camp/gun alley of anyone who enjoys the Evil Dead series (for whom KNB also did the effects). I can't imagine a more consistently entertaining film in this genre. It's one of my all-time favorites and it's always fun to see again.",From Dusk Till Dawn
369,levendis,Abysmal Clap-trap,2,5 July 1999,"Easily one of the worst vampire movies I've ever seen, and brother, I've seen a lot of vampire movies.The movie is actually quite good up until they meet the vampires. After that point, if you'll pardon the expression, it goes straight to hell.The witty Tarantino dialogue is good for a few laughs, but I couldn't put any stock in Clooney's ""bad guy"" performance. In addition, Tarantino's character seems to be there just so he can see his mug on the big screen. Harvey Keitel is the only cast member whose character carries any weight, and even at that his script is so stilted so many places that it's impossible to listen to him speak with a straight face.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Robert Rodriguez. has his own way of shooting a film..that just makes it so....Mesmerizing. After I first watched From Dusk Till dawn...I just had to watch it again. I couldn't believe some of the scenes camera angles that are used.But the one thing that made me come back again and again, and eventually purchasing the video was the characters. The way the characters are written and played...Just, they're so well done. They're enjoyable even though they're bad (Seth, Richie) I got to say that this movie was one of Tarintino's better written scripts! And I can hardly wait till the sequel and prequel! If you're in need of a good laugh rent From Dusk TIll Dawn...But have an open mind!",From Dusk Till Dawn
371,DrLetoPicard,"Despite it's bad points, a great horror film.",8,30 January 2002,"If you don't know the story behind it getting made - basically, Robert Kurtzman wrote the story, he wanted it turned into a screenplay. He did makeup effects on Pulp Fiction for free in exchange for Tarantino writing the screenplay.There's basically two problems with the film. One, is that Rodriguez isn't all that good at the horror genre. The other is that the story has a few sour points - especially the ending, which feels artificial to me.The first hour is great, because Rodriguez is good at that sort of story - gangsters on the run. It's so good, it makes the second half - the vampire story - a little too jarring. I love the concept of getting an extensive background on the characters involved in a horror film, instead of simply thrusting a bunch of people into a situation before we even get to know them. What sours it is how the vampire story is handled. It's very conventional. We get some additional characters to contend with in the second half, and while they're playing stereotypes on purpose, they seem too cartoonish even in the midst of gooey vampires. I will grant that Rodriguez has some fun with the stereotypes, though, such as Fred Williamson's speech.That's the main problem with Rodriguez's vision. I don't like the vampires in the film. They're gooey and gross and ugly. Now, I'm not into the vampire mania of recent years, but I just found the vampires too uninteresting. They've lost what makes them unique as villains, and could be nothing than a bunch of raptors. The film also delivers just a touch too much gore - I like gore, but it has to be in proportion to the mood of the film, and this was a little heavy - not surprising considering the story came from a great splatter effects artist looking to show off his craft. Still, it detracts, especially after how nicely the scene where Clooney discovers what's happened to the hostage while he was picking up food is handled.While this seems like I'm on the negative side of the film, I'm not - I love it. The dialogue, Tarantino's domain, is sharp, funny and interesting, just like his previous films. It's delivered very, very well by Clooney and the rest of the cast - moments such as his ""Pyschos do not blow up when sunlight touches them!"" speech, Juliette Lewis's casual ""Thanks"" after Clooney knocks out his brother, his dialogue with the hostage at the beginning of the film, and his and Keitel's dialogue on the way to Mexico. Great stuff, and it makes the film more than worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.I also have to say that Salma Hayek's dance is possibly the most erotic thing ever put into a wide-release film. It's worth the price of admission alone.",From Dusk Till Dawn

374,Jamesgraphics,Up there with 'The Evil Dead' and 'Re-Animator',10,29 July 2003,"'From Dusk 'Til Dawn' is one of the greatest exploitation movies of all time. As wild, creative and unique as any of the cult favourites of movie history, it has an extraordinary ability to cross genres. Gangster, road movie, action, horror, comedy... it's fitting that all of the lead characters are so different (preacher man, adolescent girl, Chinese boy, super-cool gangster, retarded killer... versus a bunch of vampires!)The key difference here is that movies with this kind of outrageous energy are usually zero-budget labours-of-love... whereas this one stars George Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis, and is scripted by one of the best writers in Hollywood.But this is the key point. Despite it's budget and cast list, this is STILL AN EXPLOITATION MOVIE! It's not a cross-over mainstream multi-plex hit like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs', this is genuine, anarchic, genre film-making. So if your favourite movie is the F***ING SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION or worse, Star Wars, then GO AWAY! This film ISN'T FOR YOU! WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR YOUR OPINION!

You won't hear me complaining at all about FROM DUSK TIL DAWN. It's a prime example of what a modern vampire flick should be, since every other possible way to make a good one has already been the key essence of those blood-sucker films from the 1920s until the mid 1970s.There is now a fictional universe that is understood by a handful of people. Mayhem is everyday life. Guns lock and load every second. Simple people are pulled into the character's troubles against their will. Big Kahuna Burger joints spring up as fast as any McDonald's or Taco Bell. Foul language is just kind, normal speech. This is a universe that is only fully recognized by its creator.

I found it hard to relate this movie to ""Horror"" as it is tagged on IMDb: vampires are merely jokes, not even close to an actual threat. One of the funniest scene for this film is to watch how ineligible can a vampire be; it reminds me of some old time antiques like ""monster squad"". Come on, a vampire/werewolf that walks like an old man all the time? Sure the shooting techniques are very much limited by their time, but always I cannot help compare them to ""underworld"" and then conclude I probably should never watch a pure vampire film before 2000 again.Well this movie is not a pure vampire film, it's much more than that. You will see Quentin plays a psycho (I didn't know he could act), how a Vietnam veteran, a sex machine, a retired priest, a escaped thief and two kids slaughter a bunch of vampires in a bar called titty-twister, how Salma Hayek perform a half-naked dance with a snake on her, and how the thief become Dr. Phil for a priest.

Then they enter the bar, again all looks good. Then someone turns into a vampire. At this point, immediately evacuate the room, for your first great impressions should not be spoilt by the anticlimax that is to follow. I fully relaxed at this point, I was no longer engaged in the film. I almost lost sleep over, but not quite, the decision to either give this a 3 or a 4.

With the attention-robbing first scene in the convenient store, this horror/dark comedy explodes into action.  Not to mention the script which fits George Clooney's (The Peacemaker, ER) style of rapid, intimidating yet cool and laughable speech to a T.  You need to walk into this movie with the expectation that this is not going to be a sweet movie to swallow.  The rough language and gut-churning violence combine to make this a easily labeled ""vulgar"" movie.  As mentioned before, the script is comical at times, giving the impression that it should be taken as all fun and games.  Which it should.

I would suggest a longer time with the vampires and a little less with the two brothers (Clooney and Tarantino). The vampire 'segment' of the film went by way too quick. One minute they walk into the vampire-infested strip bar and the next they are fleeing from the bar with blood-stained, ripped clothes.But, the gore was necessary and somewhat...entertaining.

And one part of his movies that I like so much is his writing. He has such a unique style of writing that, combined with his unique directing, make his movies so fun. So even if he isn't the one in the director's chair, you'll still enjoy it. Now, combine that writing with director Robert Rodriguez, George Clooney, and vampires, and you got something special.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is an interesting movie. For the first half of the movie, you're watching a pretty standard Tarantino crime movie, almost akin to something like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and it's pretty good. Then, our characters get to the Titty Twister strip club, and out of nowhere... VAMPIRES!?The change from crime to vampire hunting is so drastic and sudden, you almost have no time to fully realize what's happening. All of a sudden, the film becomes an absolute bloodbath of absolutely insane proportions. And while I find it awesome, the rather abrupt change in tone can be a bit jarring.Another problem is the directing, at least for me. I'm not saying that Rodriguez is a bad director, I actually quite like him, but the problem comes from the script. Having the directing not match Tarantino's writing can make the movie feel a little... off, like it's missing a part of itself.Everything else about this movie is just awesome.

The dialogue is sharp and the Geckos are a humourous, if unsympathetic, pair. Tarantino, as a rapist and psychotic given to hearing voices which tell him, basically, whatever he wants to hear, is both scary and funny.So far so good. Until the mobile home carrying the desperados and their hostages goes over into Mexico and stops at a garish biker/trucker bar which must be one of the sleaziest joints ever portrayed in the history of Hollywood. Unfortunately, for the viewer as well as the characters, it proves to be a lair of vampires!Selma Hayek performs one of the most sexily outrageous dance routines of all time but proves to be a vampire rather than a vamp. (Too bad - Juliette Lewis is one of the films liabilities, seeming to have a movie career based on being a piece of baggage for psychotic and violent men to tote around, without any deeper discernable skills on offer than the ability to pout when the bullets are flying)Once Tarantino is dead (or undead, however you care to look at it) the movie is committed to being an out and out actioner with bursts of spoof putdowns of vampire movie cliches. Cooney, Keitel (who gives a first rate, understated performance as the disillusioned preacher / hi jack victim) and the two junior vampire hunters backing them up don't look as if they could bruise a bag of apples, let alone hold out all night against the legions of the undead. Fortunately, more convincing help is on hand in the shape of grim faced veteran Fred Williamson and ace horror make up artist Tom Savini, who steals scene after scene as whip cracking biker, 'Sex Machine'Having said this, the movie rips along at a good pace whilst never quite being able to live up to the movies from which it borrows (Carpenter's 'Assault On Precinct 13' and G.

400,t_lepine18,Great fun and excitement!,8,21 June 2008,"Okay, where do I start? Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, two amazingly creative film makers, both had a hand in this film which made me have to see it. Now I went into the film with high expectations and was not disappointed at all. It was not necessarily what I expected but it turned out to be a non-stop, action packed ride. Great cast, good acting, good writing and an excellent filmmaker (Robert Rodriguez). I couldn't think of another director who could make a film such as this one and make it actually work out the way it did. Of course there is pretty graphic violence in it but most people would expect this if you've seen any of Rodriguez's other movies. Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a rush of action-packed cinema. 10/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
401,darkness317,"Booze, guns, grit, muscle and Vampires",10,19 April 2009,"From Dusk 'Til dawn is a film that pulls many punches. They are such drastic left turns that you as the viewer can not see it coming. The writing and acting are so good it is hard to turn away. There is a scene at the end of the first act, an exchange between Tarantino and Clooney (who make a surprisingly good duo). Clooney as Seth is the more powerful brother and overshadows Richie in every aspect of life, and in this scene it is no different. Seth still loves his brother, even though he is a vicious psychopath. He is the only one he has, they only have each other. The shear power of this scene will resonate and when you think of this movie later on, this is the scene you will refer to. It is that good and one of the best scene committed to celluloid in the entire history of film. This is Quentin's second best script and Rodriguez's best film for it. George Clooney plays an ultra-suave bad ass and Quentin plays an aforementioned psychopath. Harvey Kietel, however,plays the foil to Clooney's Seth. Keitel plays Jacob, a priest who has lost his faith in the Lord. This comes into play when they are faced with vampires Seth is sure are from Hell and Jacob does not. Even though, in the middle, the film completely changes tone and setting, it never loses it's human dynamic. Being a gore hound myself, I can not help but love the second half. I must say Quentin and Robert are brave filmmakers. This film turns out to be incredibly gory and violent and awesome! No never mind to the ""best"" films ever, this is one of the greats. It is about Seth and Richie as brothers and it is also about Seth and Jacob as blood brothers. Blood brothers against the world, or in the case of the second half, the bowels of hell itself.",From Dusk Till Dawn

OTOH, this is a movie that I would certainly watch again.  Partly because I like Juliette Lewis (maybe that will give you a reference point on which to compare my opinion), but also because it's a good ride while it lasts.

408,TipsyMcstagger,Waste of talent,2,26 October 2001,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a good example of Quentin Tarantino's unfathomable desire to participate in fun but pointless endeavors rather than utilizing his talents to make more masterpieces like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. FD2D is essentially half a crime movie followed by a filmmaker's thesis on horror film special effects.  While visually interesting, the second segment of the film, for which it won its devoted fans, is pretty unintriguing, as it poses us with a battle of horribly disfigured biker ghouls against a troop of characters so unengaging that you're not really sure who to root for.  The great irony of FD2D is that it wastes the undeniable talents of Harvey Keitel, while Tarantino, not previously known as a good actor, actually puts in the most entertaining job of anyone.  In any case, From Dusk Till Dawn is a bad film, as are all of Rodriguez' films (yes, including El Mariachi), and I urge you to avoid it.",From Dusk Till Dawn

Halfway through, just when I thought it couldn't become any more boring and pointlessly violent, this bank robbery/hostage caper of a movie abruptly decides to become a vampire movie--and a gory, lumbering one at that. You can almost hear Tarantino musing, 'Hmm, what would it look like if they cut someone's hand off? Ooh! What about if a flying ax splits open someone's skull?' Etc., etc.If you read through the reviews here, you may come to the conclusion that I simply didn't understand Tarantino's point or his artistic vision. Please. He HAD no point or vision. He had some money to make a movie and apparently felt smug enough about his own reputation that he could simply throw in whatever scenes interested him. If this had been made by a no-name director and been populated with no-name actors, no distribution company would have sat through the entire movie, much less backing it.An absolute train wreck, spilling over with stinking piles of manure.",From Dusk Till Dawn

413,sue-webb-319-519889,Average horror flick,4,20 March 2012,"There may be some who liked the movie, but personally speaking, this film was a complete turnoff for me. I only watched it for George Clooney and wondered how he could sink so low as to want to use this as his big screen opportunity.It's a strange combination of slasher/vampire film that has no focus and splits up into too many directions to form a coherent story. The characters have as much depth as cartoon creations and all of them are as freakish and pathetic as anyone can get. George Clooney mumbles his way through his role in a way that suggests he'd rather be back in ""ER"" with its own kind of gore than splashing the blood of vampires. Frankly, he ought to be better at choosing material than this mess.The story starts out as a gutsy crime drama but soon veers into downright nightmarish activity at a Mexican border bar staffed by vampires. Nudity, foul language, vulgar expletives--everything is poured on thick to appeal to today's younger movie-goers who have an appetite for sex, sadism and buckets of blood. About as gross as any movie can get without leaving you with a queasy stomach.Of course, you'll get the opposite opinion from those who think Quentin Tarantino is the master of pulp horror. This graphic depiction of vampirism is sure to have them raving that this is a masterpiece only a genius like Tarantino could have invented.",From Dusk Till Dawn
414,jade-howells,Fun horror film,8,1 October 2017,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a film that I have thoroughly fallen in love with after a few watches. Originally skeptical on my first watch, deciding to give it another chance from a different viewpoint has left me appreciating the film for what it is: a fun action horror romp that shouldn't be taken too seriously.Initially dismayed that the two halves of the film (the first half with the criminal brothers fleeing to Mexico with the kidnapped family, and the second fighting vampires within the bar) felt like they were duck-taped together, upon re-watches I find that it works surprisingly well, and by the end of the film the sudden twist is actually pretty funny. The script works well, as within the first half you feel the danger that the criminal brothers Seth and Richie Gecko (played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino respectively) poses to preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his family and the second half their fight against the vampires turns the film into a fun horror movie with some strong practical effects and quite cheesy parts that makes the second half all the more fun since it feels like the films wants you to have fun along with it.All of the characters work pretty well and the actors, particularly George Clooney and Harvey Keitel, do bring in good performances. The weakest actor would probably be Quentin Tarantino, but his performance does allow you to believe that he is his character and doesn't bring down the film. The side characters, played by Tom Savini and Fred Williamson are a delight to watch, and when talking about characters, Salma Hayek has to be mentioned for her character Santanico Pandemonium, probably the most iconic part of the film, so much so that when Netflix had created a TV show based on the film, Santanico is often on all the posters and promotional materiel.While part of me still laments the fact that the two parts of the film are not their own entities, I still enjoy the movie the film for what it is and have a damn fun time watching it.",From Dusk Till Dawn

This movie was done pre-Fools Rush In, and I only recently began watching her films before Fools Rush In. She was great in Desperado and in this film as well, although, her part was fairly minuscule. I hope she continues to do well. Its amazing that she is nearly 40 and her body and looks have maintained a 25 year oldish look. If you have seen After The Sunset, you'll know what I mean.

Although he did not direct the film, he wrote the script for it, and there are splashes of his style all over the place. It really seems uncertain if this movie can really fit in the horror genre, despite the presence of vampires; a decent story just wasn't there. Tarintino's performance as Richard Gecko was also sub-par.The movies saving grace was surprisingly the acting of George Clooney; he played the part of the criminal with somewhat of a good heart to a tee, and seemed full of witty lines. Harvey Keitel also turned out a good performance as the faithless preacher.All in all the movie was a disappointment; I was expecting something golden and walked away with wasted time. The movie seems to try to compensate for its lack of a plot through extreme gore, which gets to be so redundant that it loses the desired effect.The acting was good enough, and some of the fight sequences were decent, but the movie fell short of being a horror, and nothing could save the story.",From Dusk Till Dawn

The bad Gecko brothers are incredible, the elder, Seth, is a thief, sometimes a killer, but he's not as crazy as his ""little"" brother Richard, who's a real psychopathic, full of visions that in his ill brain seem to be real. For instance, he causes the death of a man beacause, only in his mind, he saw him asking for help. But that wasn't true at all! Moreover, he imagines that a girl, the priest's daughter, asks him for a special...favor...well, you must know...The best surprise of the film is the one in the ""Titty Twister"", where a lot of people become blood-thirsty vampires.

429,paul-daniels3,From Dusk Til Dawn - A unique & original Film,8,24 March 2003,"'From dusk Till Dawn' is a vampire/horror flick unlike most others. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez came together after finishing 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Desperado' (respectively) to make this film, which was when they were at both  (arguably) at their peaks (peaks in fame, it is much hard to say when someone had their creativity peak). The uniqueness of this film stems from how there are no vampires, or hard-core action, for the first half of the film. Then it shifts gears and turns into a blood-bath shoot'em up show. Until this change in the style of the film happens, this show could have been finished in endless ways (I can't really give examples of this without spoiling the film. with the exception that before you see any vampires, they could of finished this movies as a non-vampire movie). The start and middle of the show can stand independent of the rest of the film (it still leads up to the end of the film). I found the dialog to be cleaver and funny. George Clooney fills the shoes of the main character very well (that is, he acts as a smart confident professional criminal). This movie is, without a doubt, a cheesy and cheeky horror show.

It's an enjoyable crime thriller much along the lines of Tarantino's other works (such as Pulp Fiction & Reservoir Dogs) but with a bit of Robert Rodriguez flare shown during the action sequences.Then with about 50-ish minutes left, the style film changes entirely. It becomes another film, it goes from stylish crime thriller to random vampire action movie. It's almost as if Tarantino left the room while writing the script and somebody wrote the rest of the film for him, it loses it's Tarantino charm and becomes a predictable, gore fest, vampire flick.I'm a fan of Vampire films, so I still enjoyed the movie, but I can see why others don't like it.

Then about halfway through the movie (at the exact point when you saw the first vampire) the movie turned into something that should stay buried in the dessert for nobody to see. I'm no fan of vampire movies and I hate cliché movies. Adding extremely bad special effects to the mix just makes it worse. The action was bad, the actors were bad (With the exception of Cloony, who I'm not a fan of) and the story was extremely bad.

433,Keith-Harvey2,Ride Of My Life!!!,10,11 January 2005,"Individually, both Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are astounding filmmakers. Films like Pulp fiction, Reservoir Dogs, El Mariachi and Desperado have shaped the lives of the many young people that have grown up with them.But put these two together and the result could have swung either way. It could have been extremely good, or on the other hand it could have been Four Rooms (shudder!!) Well let me just say that 'From Dusk till Dawn' has to be one of my favourite films in years. The reason for this? I've never seen anything more original than this movie. The first half sets itself up to be a heist movie, Resrvoir Dogs Lite if you like. Two Brothers, Seth and Jacob have robbed a bank and taken a preacher and his children hostage. Their aim? To make it across the border to Mexico where they will be safe from the police and destined for a life of luxury. They stop off at a strip bar called the Titty Twister, where they are scheduled to meet their dealer. They all sit down, relax and watch in awe as Salma Hayek entices them with a sexy dance routine involving beer and her foot. Then she turns into a VAMPIRE!!!!!!!! Well i didn't see that one coming! The next half of the movie sees George Clooney (In a role played to perfection) and the rest of the survivors fight off the fiends from hell. I haven't had so much fun with a film since Back to the Future. Its one of those films that you can endlessly quote to exhaustion. I'm tied up at the moment between 'What do you think i want you mean old b*****d' and 'Psychos do NOT explode when sunlight hits them. I don't give a f**k how crazy they are!' Both by Clooney. The film is full of touches from both directors. The trunk shot found in all of Tarantinos films has not gone amiss and the trademark Rodriguez Clutch gun is here as well. The script is brilliant and the action scenes are handled masterfully. The soundtrack is a standout with the opening theme Dark Night destined to stick in your head for ages. It just cant do no wrong. Well, i lie. Whoever cast Ernest Liu should be shot as the child has no obvious emotion. His death scene should be satisfying yet ends up being cringe inducing. But apart from that the film excels and is the perfect way to while away 90 minutes of a weekend. Rent it, buy it, tape it. Whatever you do just make sure you see this film and then spread the word around. This film Rules!!!!!!!!!!!1",From Dusk Till Dawn
434,jesuit25,Crime/Horror,8,10 January 2005,"I loved this film for many reasons. For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.And the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.The script is witty and full of dark humour, ""I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you."", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the 'gentleman' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.A special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned, it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead (well, perhaps not THAT bad).For once, this is a film which doesn't give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don't know what's in store for them. If you hadn't seen this before, without any knowledge of the movie, you'd be in for a huge surprise as I was.An 8/10 for it's script (thanks to Tarantino) and the actors who, while not trying too hard, make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference.",From Dusk Till Dawn
435,weezerrox101,Best vampire movie of the nineties,10,23 January 2005,"I am not a fan of vampire movies. I am, however, a huge Tarantino fan.  I was excited to see Tarantino's take on vampires. It wasn't bad.  Everyone knows this is probably his worst movie, but you have to  consider its stiff competition. Reservior Dogs,  True Romance Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, and the Kill Bills are all  fantastic. This movie is entertaining, funny, and it has well developed  characters. Nothing is too far fetched, as long as you consider it's a  movie about vampires. It's not a horror movie. Nor was it meant to be  one. It is not a comedy, but it is funny. It does not really fit into  any genre. It's just two hours of an dialog and action.",From Dusk Till Dawn
436,caw001,From Good to Awful,3,16 January 2006,"You know, before this movie, I never thought that Quentin Tarantino could've been involved in anything bad. Well my friends, I have seen the devil, and its name is From Dusk Till Dawn.This movie follows the rest of Tarantino's catalog and centers around a couple of lowlife thugs. In this case, it's the Gecko brothers, Seth and Ritchie (George Clooney and Tarantino himself). They're on the run from the law and about to cross the border into Mexico and Freedom. Their ticket out is the Fuller family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu, and Juliette Lewis) also heading into Mexico. The Gecko brothers take the family hostage and, after making it across the border, hang out at the designated meeting place: a topless bar.Now for the fun part. It turns out that the bar is a late-nite hangout for vampires. And guess who's on the menu tonight?Appalled yet? I am. It's not that I'm against the idea in the first place, but these are two different movies duct taped together by one dance sequence. Sorry guys, it just doesn't work.When watching this movie, I felt like I was driving in a car that, for no reason whatsoever, suddenly jumped into a higher gear and took off at full speed. The first hour of the movie was more than watchable; it was pretty damn good. I loved the characters of the Gecko brothers and I thought that the movie would be about the conflict between the calm, calculating Seth and the unpredictable Ritchie, who will shoot or rape whomever he pleases. In fact, when he first sees Juliette Lewis' character, he imagines her asking him for oral sex. Ritchie, in my mind, was the time bomb of the movie, waiting to go off and throw the plot into a tailspin. Whoo boy, was I wrong.The second hour of the movie is the schlockiest of horror films you've ever seen. After seeing Robert Rodriguez' ""Sin City"", I knew that he had a taste for on screen violence. Well, this movie is more of the same. The vampires of the movie are the best that 1996 special effects could produce. That doesn't really say much, but man, are they gory. People's arms are ripped off their bodies, heads are hollowed out by shotguns, and one vampire is vanquished by having his heart ripped from his body and staked by a toothpick. Fun wow, huh?The first half of the movie had Tarantino's trademark element of humor. For instance, the first time we see Seth and Ritchie, they are trying to get out of a liquor store that a cop has just entered. Once the cop leaves to relieve himself, Seth and Ritchie, guns drawn, start having a discussion about whether or not the clerk tipped the cop off. It's hilariously funny and timed to perfection. Those first scenes should set the tone for the rest of the movie. And as I've probably spent too much time belaboring, halfway through, the film takes a sharp left turn. Over a bridge. Down a ravine. And into a tar pit.I wouldn't be so livid if the second half of the movie was well done. The vampire sequences in From Dusk Till Dawn have all been done before in other vampire movies, and frankly, the new parts just don't make any sense. While watching the film, I counted the following elements that caused my jaw to hit the floor, only to be reeled back up and let go again: 1. A cross composed of a shotgun and a baseball bat. 2. A hydraulic stake 3. A Holy Water Super Soaker (Can you say ""Bordello of Blood""?) 4. Characters having personal moments while being devoured hoagie-style by vampires. 5. A mariachi band that, at the moment of truth, morphs into a band of mutants with bloody corpses for instruments. 6. Lines like ""Okay Vampire Killers, let's kill some f***ing vampires!"" 7. Multiple appearances by Cheech Marin.See what I mean? What isn't tired is plain ridiculous. And there are more examples of absurdity in this movie. You could find them yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you.Harvey Keitel, who's had a history with Tarantino, plays Jacob Fuller, a priest who lost his faith in God when his wife died. There's nothing necessarily wrong with this character or how he's portrayed, but tell me this, why is it that whenever there is a story concerning evil or Satanic creatures, the local priest chooses to question his faith then? Juliette Lewis plays his daughter. Honestly, I wish I could've gotten to know her better. Lewis is a very talented and beautiful actress, but I guess when you're stuck with a part that is basically a young girl reacting to the situation around her, it's like putting a ballet dancer in a full-body cast. The only defining personality trait about her is that she gets really good with a crossbow when the going gets tough. I mean, really, she's like the Teenage Terminator! (Not a bad idea.) And I can't really call it a ""defining"" personality trait because everyone gets it at the same time in this movie.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" just plain does not work. Tarantino and Rodriguez are very talented filmmakers, and they've proved that time and time again, but they have given both their resumes a black eye with this mutated hybrid of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Assault on Precinct 13."" If you value the works of either person, avoid this movie like the vampires it portrays.",From Dusk Till Dawn
437,mparker95,A vampire film that doesn't feel like a vampire film.,8,30 May 2005,"This is really two films in one. First it is a crime film with a double act, one of whom is cold and calculating and the other who is sick and deprived but dependent on his partner. Tarintino is all over this film, in particular this part. The sheriff at the beginning is the sheriff in Kill Bill and of course the Tarintino staple dialogue is intoxicating throughout this film. I haven't even mentioned vampires yet!!! That is probably because their presence in the film sneaks up on you like it did to the characters. The two sides to the film is like the two sides of the world that characters experience, one with real life monsters like Seth and Richard Gecko, (Clooney and Tarintino), to the one with monsters from hell, VAMPIRES! My point is that this is the vampire film that doesn't feel like a vampire film. It's like Desperado if it was written by Tarintino and had a few vampires in it. That leads me to my other point. In Robert Rodriguez (director) and Quenten Tarintino (Screenplay Writer) two of the greatest modern film makers combine to make something gritty, a realistic vampire flick.

Of course it's even better when the movies cast contains actors of the calibre of George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and the very sexy Salma Hayek in a delicious and highly sensual cameo appearance. The movie itself starts off as a road movie with Clooney and Tarantino as bank robber/killers who are on the run from the police. Things change for the pair after they enlist the aid of a preacher (Keitel) and his two children (including daughter Juliette Lewis) to get across the border to their rendezvous at the Titty Twister biker bar. What happens from that point is pure fun, and as long as your not the squeamish kind you should find the movie highly entertaining.

But of course as I said before this was all George Clooney show as he was so aggressive and new things were gonna come his as the character he played. I felt bad for the family they murdered but they worked together later which was the good twist. This movie had so much twists which made it even better as the vampires came out of nowhere.

It felt silly and just inappropriate from what we'd seen at the beginning, and I actually got a little bored.That being said, I really liked Harvey Kietel's performance and George Clooney was much better than I'd thought he'd be.

From Dusk Till Dawn is a hidden masterpiece of film. The most noticeable thing about this movie is the sudden change halfway through the movie. It goes from bank robbers on the run to bank robbers fighting vampires. This was not done because of bad writing, it was done because of excellent writing. The amazing writing makes the totally ruthless bank robbers into guys you root for. Only a few writers can show the two stars killing people like nothing and along the way making them almost good. The audience doesn't want the Gecko brothers to get caught, so who (or what) can have the strength to get in their way. Seeing the Gecko brothers are untouchable you have to have something other than cops stand in their way and that's when the vampires come into play. The vampires is a source that makes you root for the Gecko brothers because their nasty and all in all worse than the gecko's. So, you root against the vampires. Also the vampires really bring out Seth's nice side. He ends up helping the family he kidnapped.The movie is filled with great one-liners and really great imaginations.

I saw the film when it first came out, about 16 years ago now, back at the time people didn't know it was a vampire flick until they saw it! Nowadays, most people are aware of this even if they haven't seen it, which certainly takes the surprise element away when you watch it which for me was a big part of it. I remember when Salma Hayek first turned into a vampire during the film, I thought up until that point it was your good yet typical gangster film, how wrong was I!! The film is full of funny one liners, mostly delivered by George Clooney. Other main stars are Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Danny Trejo, Salma Hayek & Cheech (who actually plays 3 different parts in the film). My only problem with the film was Ernest Liu, who plays Scott - his acting skills were......lets say ""not great"".... I like the end when Juliette Lewis drives the RV away - the camera pans back to reveal that the ""Titty Twister"" bar is the top of an Aztec temple, obviously the source and true home of the vampires!

Although there are a few humorous moments and kitschy references to other (better) movies, I was just left scratching my head and confused as to why I was still watching this awful movie.

Tarantino's acting is questionable but Clooney and Keitel are formidable. I think The end is brilliant. What would be best would be if Tarantino had cut out the disturbing start of this film and gone from when they enter Mexico. Obviously he could just as easily re-do the start to make it less controversial, maybe with the brother's escape from jail. The scene with vampires is brilliant. I didn't know that was how the film was going to turn out, but Tarantino is brilliant in directing these final scenes.

This one certainly qualifies I had always herd about the film but never knew much about it only that it had something to do with Vampires which is odd since I consider myself a great appreciator of Tarantinos work.From the first few frames I knew it had something to do with Tarantino and 2 minutes into the dialog I had no doubt that he wrote it. The first half of the movie plays out flawlessly just as you would expect a Tarantino screenplay to do and Rodrigeuz does some wonderful directing and editing which compliments Tarantinos writing beautifully. Then suddenly without warning your slammed over the head with beyond over the top Rodriguez style 'zombie exploding' gore akin to planet terror and your wondering how someone could have snuck into your living room and changed the DVD without you noticing. The blood and puss bath is followed by Tarantinos one of a kind dialog and most thoughts of ending the film there have subsided. But your still left with the initial shock of the sudden about face from respectable film in the same league as Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs to a film thats so gore oriented its difficult to take seriously until after the film has ended and you've been able to vent about it on IMDb.Don't get me wrong I still love this film and enjoyed it immensely even though its ripe with continuity errors and it almost becomes a different film half way through you would still be an idiot to turn it off at that point. There's still Tarantinos extremely human characters in very extraordinary circumstances and a great story around that. And to be fair the gore does allow some very clever comic absurdity as only Rodriguez can provide but its taken far beyond the level needed and if it were more restrained this film would have a 9 not a 7 on IMDb, have an audience drawn in by topnotch film making not exploding corpses and would be a very brilliant film rather then a very good film.",From Dusk Till Dawn

After the somewhat exaggerated burning scene at the start, one is inclined to think, 'well the Tarantino atmosphere is there, he just got carried away.' Indeed, Harvey Keitel, naturally, but also George Clooney, and Tarantino himself continue to pronounce their well-chosen lines with exactly the right emphasis and all seems set for more interesting plot turns. However, being completely unprepared for Mexicans rising from the dead and turning into monsters, I found myself gazing stupefied at what followed.(The presence of Juliette Lewis might have warned me that something weird was coming, but since the Tarantino character seemed the central psycho of the story, I didn't expect inhumans in any literal way). How could he and Rodriguez have thrown their fine ingredients into this maladorous boiling pot of illogical nonsense? Now that I learn that this was his first script, I hope for a return to the older, or rather later developed style.

They kidnap Harvey Keital and family, before driving to this Mexican Bar. You start to wonder where this is going, and then all of a sudden - Vampires Appear!!  Why!!  I mean this is crazy!  Where did that come from, it is as if they got together and said, OK, I've got a fairly decent Tarantinoesque crime thriller, lots of violence, Clooney would be great for the role of the sane brother, but I don't have an Act II.  Then someone says - I know - lets have Vampires appear led by a sexy sadistic Salma Hayek, and the kidnappers and kidnapped will set aside their differences to fight their undead enemies, and I know, have Juliette Lewis fall in love with George Clooney at the end.  I would sincerely love to come into this film completely ignorant again just to watch the moment when they all turn into Vampires, but then again I would also like to go back in time and never go to see Star Wars Episode Franchise I, but we can't have everything can we?!",From Dusk Till Dawn

475,scream_out_loud13,Two Movies - Fun if you let it be,8,29 March 2004,"This movie was never intended to be a serious 'project'. Both Rodriguez and Tarantino wanted this movie to shout back to their favorites. Typical for Tarantino (and gone horribly wrong with Kill Bill). I love the beginning to this film. I've watched it more than a few times, and probably worn out the rental version that I pick up every couple of months (should get around to buying it...). I first saw this on TV and excitedly watched a cheer-for-the-bad-guy heist movie. BUT, 30 min it turns itself around. Completely. It becomes campy, and silly, and the giant shout out. Honestly, I would have loved this movie to death had it continued with the original story line. I do like it as is, but it's a bit of a shock to have the entire premise turn on you. Not bad, lots of fun, and be damned if you try to take it seriously.",From Dusk Till Dawn
476,Erchio_IV,Screwed up end,1,12 August 2005,"It's a long time ago I saw this movie and still it's one of the worst I've ever seen. I like lots of kind of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. Not a combination of two. This could have been a wonderful movie, but they all blew it up. I didn't want to see this movie, but friends of mine insisted to watch it. I didn't know it was such a crap. I loved the first part, in which Clooney and Tarantino drove through Texas, killing everybody on their way (especially the scene with the liquor shooting was excellent), but at its turning point, in the titty twister bar everything changed. Stupid Vampires took over the place and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like 'Nightmare on Elmsteet'. If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And when you love bloodstolling thrillers don't watch it at all, you will be very disappointed at the end.",From Dusk Till Dawn

It was shaping up to be a really good movie right up until Salma Hayek turned into the cheesiest vampire I've ever seen.  It was all downhill from there. I can't believe George Clooney lowered his standards as much as he did to be in this movie.,From Dusk Till Dawn
478,mattpeterson07,Pulp Fiction and Desperado with a little Blade,10,24 July 2005,"Two dangerous convicts hold up a convenience store and end up executing a Texas Ranger and engaging in a bloody shootout with the clerk. After leaving, they take family hostage, a once-preacher father and his son and daughter. They make them a deal, stay with them until coming dawn and they will be released unharmed. They hole up for the night in a back-roads bar just over the Mexican border. Unknown to them though, they will soon be fighting for their lives against the bar's real owners, a group of vampires with a taste for blood and gore.This is a joint film between Quentin Tarentino, the creator of such classics as Pulp Fiction and later Kill Bill, and Robert Rodriguez, the creator of El Mariachi and later Sin City. With Rodriguez directing and Tarentino writing, producing and acting, this film is a force to be reckoned with. The script is classic Tarentino, with references to other cult classics, his own and others, and the dialogue is flawless in getting us close to the characters. The style of Desperado and El Mariachi is seen here too and shows why Rodriguez is one of the most coveted directors in Hollywood.The acting next to the crew is what really gets this film going. In the opening scene alone, a Texas Ranger played by Michael Park shows what real acting is in his short role of only a few minutes. George Clooney and Tarentino as the convicts play off each other well with Clooney being the quick-witted professional and Tarentino playing his younger brother with a psychopath hiding beneath the surface. Tarentino plays his role well, but Clooney shines as Seth Gecko with classic one-liners and acting ability. Harvey Keitel is great as the preacher father who lost his faith in God and Juliette Lewis as his daughter shows acting potential as well. Smaller roles by Fred Williamson and make-up artist Tom Savini do not go unnoticed either.This movie is almost two films in one as the opening half gets us into the characters and the second being a twist into horror as the characters fight for their lives against the vampires. People may find that one half suits them better than the other, but no matter what, Rodriguez, Tarentino and the actors take us for a ride that few will forget.",From Dusk Till Dawn
479,Metal133,"Excellent, until about half way...",7,9 May 2005,"I thought Rodriguez did a very good job with the movie, however, I believe the movie should have been left as a crime drama, and not turned into this horde of vampires attacking people. It had A lot of potential even when they went into the titty twister, until the whole vampire thing happened, I think it just went downhill and became corny, and a lot of the acting from most of the characters was on the downside. The story was perfect for a crime movie. Tarantino and Clooney were great acting. The camera work was very well done until the titty twister part came. Overall, if the movie stayed in the crime genre, it could have been amazing.",From Dusk Till Dawn

In my opinion, the others, excluding Tom Savini, were nothing to be excited about.The action and humour were extremely well done and I enjoyed the weapons created near the end. The only big problem and what made me rate the way I did was the lack of characters' story, plot was not important for the story but I would have loved to learn more about Clooney and Tarantino characters.Overall, if you are a fan of these types of movies, check them out.",From Dusk Till Dawn

The change in George Clooney's character, Quentin Tarantino's typical lunatic roles, and the fact that it doesn't fall under any specific genre is puzzling in a good and a fun way! Young Juliette Lewis was good looking. Salma Hayek is captivating and charismatic, and her role, even though she appears only briefly, added to the movie big time! Wherever you see Tarantino, you see a bloody movie. It doesn't matter if he's the director, or just a psychotic, misanthropic criminal.

We immediately thought it silly with the filthy language and senseless killing. We kept with it, thinking George Clooney would pull it from the depths it was headed. Instead he just took it deeper. The minister's family tried to give some balance, but he was reduced to blithering rather than emboldened by what he experienced. Then the bar bums and naked women turned into vampires. The body count was immense and gross. This movie had more violence than Private Ryan. I can't recommend it to anyone for any reason.",From Dusk Till Dawn

You're going through your life, minding your own business, pursuing schemes and dreams and then bam! Here they come, shaking you out of your mundane existence and ushering you (at top speed) into a world that is so opposite what you know and believe that the hairs on the back of your neck are permanently at attention. I don't believe that vampires are all romance, and although I can believe they come in different dispositions, this movie struck a chord of terror in me that goes back to the era of jumping off the bed in the middle of the night and running to the bathroom so whatever was lurking underneath couldn't grab a hold of your ankles. The setup was so sophisticated, so pat and so immersed in mundane obscenity, how could you possibly expect the evil to get so much more evil? This movie is somebody's nightmare--take it from someone who has been fascinated by the concept of vampires since they were a small child.

If you're looking for a good Tarantino-esque crime drama, you'll be disappointed; if you're looking for a good horror spoof--no dice, either.This film is like pickles and ice cream--separately, you may like either, but together they taste horrible--and it would take a decidedly skewed state-of-mind to accept then at the same time.  The film begins very promisingly as a dark and gritty gangster film and sloppily switches to a gratuitous sendup of Hammer horror films. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" represents everything that is wrong with the post-postmodern film world--if you can't innovate, imitate.  Unfortunately, Tarantino and Rodriguez don't seem to be able to do either very well, anymore. Clooney's character is as interesting as his stereotype can be; Keitel looks like he's doing the filmmaker a favor; even Salma Hayek comes off as unsexy and completely non-threatening as the ""main"" vampire.

Quentin Taratino plays here the nuts brother who kills for fun, without thinking, George Clooney is the other brother, the wise one and Harvey Keitel plays a father who lost his faith but will soon change his mind, and as the cherry on the top you'll see Salma Hayek dancing like hell...

493,ross.gibson,Rarely am I moved to submit a review ...,1,30 October 2000,"... but on this occassion, I just couldn't resist.Within just a few minutes, I felt uncomfortable with this film. Like most films in which Tarantino is involved, everything was predictable. Some people have referred to this film as fun. Yawn. The gratuitous violence is just so dull and I often wonder if Tarantino and Rodriguez are actually pitching this trash at the sub 15 year old market, despite its inevitable censorship classification. If adults are truly enjoying this type of trash, then we are in big trouble.This movie came across as a poor short story that couldn't/wouldn't go anywhere and so a vampire thing was tacked on to make up time. But still no story.I suspect that Harvey Keitel may regret being involved in this film. As most know, he has proved his skill and talent as an actor on many occassion, but why did he get involved in this? I must confess that I would have been surprised if Juliette Lewis wasn't involved in this. This is just her thing. Maybe there is some talent there, but who would know? George Clooney may well be challenging Kevin Costner as the planet's most boring actor. He is as convincing as your average politician and I'm sure that I won't even notice that he has stopped working, or has he already? Some have also suggested that if one enjoyed this film, Natural Born Killers should be high on one's list. Sorry. Impossible. Natural Born Killers was warning us of our bad habits in allowing manipulative media into our homes. From Dusk Till Dawn offers, well, nothing but wooden actors (except for Mr Keitel) and rubbery parts splattered in Hollywood ketchup.

George Clooney is very, very cool as his brother Seth Gecko, however it was predicted that he would survive and turn out being the good guy.This movies is in all honesty a brilliantly unique film with many great characters, e.g Sex Machine, a very sexy dance by Salma Hayek and some great vampire killing.

Christianity is not the only religion that would have power over vampires (supposing they existed). Greek religion has several Gods who would be effective as well. I'm thinking primarily of far-darting Apollon. His attributes are light, archery (arrows are usually made of wood) and He killed the Python at Delphi (the vampires had a decidedly reptilian look).Lewis put me in mind of another deity who was known for archery: Artemis, the virgin huntress.",From Dusk Till Dawn

The film is split in 2 parts: first the movie shows how the gecko brothers try to get to Mexico, the second part is about the ""titty twister"" where they fight against vampires...the movie is exciting (especially the escaping), and its absolutely fun because of the Tarantino dialogue and cult scenes. if you want to watch an exciting and serious vampire film, watch another movie. i think Tarantino and Rodriguez made all that vampire stuff just for fun and to make something really weird, crazy and surprising (and they did it damn good,). some ppl say that they are disappointed because they suspected a good horror film. in my opinion it's not really a horror movie, the fun is the most important in from dusk till dawn.if you could REALLY laugh in pulp fiction or movies like sin city (not just grin, really LAUGH) this movie is perfect for you.i recommend it for every Tarantino/rodriguez fan. a really must-see.10/10",From Dusk Till Dawn

Anyone who is about to watch this movie, I'm warning you that you might not ever want to see another Quentin Tarantino movie ever again and might change your thoughts about him. Certainly Tarantino's worst screenplay, in fact, it is one of the worst screenplays ever written. What an embarrassment to Tarantino's otherwise flawless resume.

This movie is clearly intended to be a melange of farce, action, and comedy. And it succeeds in all three respects admirably.

505,rickmx,"Pure Magic!! Tarantino, Rodriguez, and Kurtzman's USA-Mex cross-cultural phenomenon has achieved immortal status.",10,11 July 2020,"Back in 1996 when i saw this film i recall i liked it and had a lot of fun seeing it with my family. But that was it. Then a couple months ago for some reason i saw it again, and God!! Finally saw what i missed back then. I have never been an ardent fan of Quentin Tarantino's films even though i know he's considered by many one of the greatest filmmakers out there. Reg Robert Rodriguez I enjoy greatly the Mexican atmosphere he infused in some of his early works. I like both filmmakers' movies, but just that.However, with ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" they have crafted something i can't get out of my mind, and i don't want to let it go. I just rediscovered what I consider the coolest most surreal and fascinating film ever. I saw abundant details that I missed when I saw the film almost 25 years ago. Usually, each Saturday night i get relaxed in my room past midnight, and before going to sleep i want to go with a sense of good feelings and fascination. And to do that I keep replaying From Dusk Till Dawn's scenes that stir in me a crescendo of wonder, magic, and indescribable emotions. And those scenes are from the second half of the movie till the very last minutes of the end featuring a fantastic revelation shot of the film. One that left me in awe before screen goes dark and credits start rolling to the tune of that mega cool song ""Dark Night"" by the Blasters. Please note that as a whole the movie is great from start to finish, and I would not change a single thing. Each character is perfect starting from the main lead ultra-cool tough who plays by the rules character Seth Gecko played unequalled by George Clooney (can't picture anyone else in his role), and his psycho menacing brother Richie played nicely by Quentin Tarantino (both, Clooney and Tarantino have great chemistry playing as brothers), the faith struggling tormented preacher Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis she was always great for this type of films), and son Scott (Ernest Liu) who infuses the character with a sense of innocence. They are joined later at the bar by very peculiar and weird character biker Sex Machine bearing a whip and silver pistol on his bulge (Tom Savini) and Frost the tough African-American ex combat vet. And what can I say about their counterparts the bar patrons Cheech Marin playing three different roles though the one I found hilarious is Chet Pussy greeting visitors and uttering foul sexual content language at the entrance door of the bar, the menacing and ferocious bartender Razor Charlie (Danny Trejo), Big Emilio (Ernest Garcia) the big lurking henchman, and the smoking hot and seductive queen of the vampires Santanico Pandemonium resembling an Aztec princess played by Salma Hayek, and whose erotic dance with an albino snake wrapped around her body makes her look unreal as she moves in synchrony to the After Dark theme played majestically by the house musical band ""Tito & Tarantula"". Btw, it's crazy wicked hilarious seeing the band vocalist using a limbless torso corpse as a guitar and the trumpeter using a corpse's backbone as a trumpet playing the instruments in a frantic rhythm once they deform into vampires. These main characters along with the bikers and truckers are all essential to the story. I wouldn't change a single character and/or minor element in the film. They are all perfect to me.I appreciate that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously in the horror aspect which has some comedic dark tones. But there is something amazing and symbolic in the background. I don't know whether Tarantino, Rodriguez, and Kurtzman planned it like that from the beginning or was mere coincidence, but they achieved something unique and fascinating not only by blending crime and horror genres but by blending two cultures once our main characters get across the Mexican border. They blended the ultra-cool modern American western desert-like atmosphere filled with bikers, truckers, bar clubs decorated with multi-colored neon like tubes advertising the coolest bar ever, the fantastic dark fabled ""Titty Twister"" bar with the fascinating and legendary Mexican ancient prehispanic culture of Chac Mool sculptures (can you believe that, they placed an AWESOME CHAC MOOL!! sculpture albeit headless in the center of the bar's front yard. Inside the bar there's jaguar skin decorations (the jaguar was a sort of godly deity in prehispanic times), ancient hairless Mexican dogs, and an imposing giant snake reminiscent of the Aztec god feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl.
The ""Titty Twister"" bar is the heart and soul of this hallucinating and amazing film. The decorations of the bar in and out are unique. On the outside the bar looks full of life starting with the giant topples dancer made out of neon light tubes mounted on the roof as well as the neon multi-colored red pinkish, purple, green, and blue tubes advertising ""Nude dancing girls, ""chicas calientes desnudas"" and ""Hot carnitas"". Not to mention the bikers frantically riding their motorcycles all over the place and around the awesome Chac Mool sculpture with fire coming out from the center of the statue.The filmmakers have crafted something indeed unique, surreal, and special. As i'm in love with Mexican prehispanic culture spotting for the first time a headless Chac Mool sculpture outside the bar in the center surrounded by truck tires buried mid ground is amazing and mesmerizing to me as the camper van with our main characters approaches the bar. Inside the bar there is the energetic Tito & Tarantula house band with mariachi outfits performing cheerful folkloric songs ""Angry Cockroaches - Cucarachas Enojadas"" and the hypnotic and very fitting ""After Dark"" theme to the rhythm of explosive sensual and erotic dance of Salma Hayek memorable debut. Both cultures, Mexican and American, complement themselves in such a way that one needs the other to become the coolest thing ever on earth. Neither the lifeless Mexican Prehispanic settings, decorations, and motifs of the bar would have worked without the enliven American western atmosphere made up with colorful neon lights, a disco dance ball hanging inside the bar, cheered up bikers and truckers nor would the American western setting decorated with colorful neon lights and cheerful bikers and truckers had worked without the ancient Mexican settings and prehispanic sculptures. It's just crazy awesome watching two 3,000-year-old ancient Aztec dogs called Xoloitzcuintli guarding the entrance to the bar and a giant snake crawling downstairs reminiscent of the Chichen Itza pyramid feathered snake Aztec god Quetzalcoatl.It's that amazing twist by the middle of the film that reveals the bar as a trap for unsuspecting bikers and truckers that naively stop by in the middle of the Mexican border desert to have a great time only to be devoured by hungry vampires past midnight. And this is when the film transcends from the real to the unreal magical realm. I really love and appreciate the vampires' distinctive physical traits as they have lost any human traits they once had. The vampire girls dancers are wicked cool and love how the vampires take human form after flying around the bar as a pack of bats. That background shot of the ""Titty Twister"" bar on the cover of the poster with bats flying in and out the bar as the sun sets makes it look so eerie and fascinating. The bar is indeed the heart and soul of the film.Finally, as that hell of a night is about to come to an end for our main protagonists, Seth, Jacob and his daughter Kate and son Scott are struggling fighting the ferocious blood suckers. And I can't help but feel melancholy that it will end soon when there's left only two survivors standing in the center of the bar about to be devoured by the vampires when suddenly sunlight rays start filtering through bullet holes on the bar walls. They realize the vampires weakness when daylight starts burning them to death, and finally they are rescued by Seth's cohort Mexican crime boss Carlos and his henchmen by taking down the bar gloomy heavy entrance door.There is a final shot of Kate being left there after receiving a gift from Seth, and as she leaves in the RV vehicle we start hearing such a cool and nostalgic song ""Dark Night"" by the Blasters as the camera zooms out to the deserted landscape to reveal the most shocking scene when it's revealed that the back of the ""Titty Twister"" bar was built atop a semi buried giant Aztec like pyramid with trailer trucks buried around the pyramid and other ones parked on the side terrains of the Mexican bar in the western-like desert in the middle of the road.The fact that I keep playing this film obsessively especially every Saturday past midnight is a testament to such a special and memorable piece of film making. I love old classics like Alien, Aliens, Predator, the first two Terminator films, The Matrix, and i'm a huge follower of MCU Marvel movies (Marvel Studios created the greatest superhero saga ever) and the Star Wars universe (I had a blast with The Mandalorian episodes better than the last SW trilogy.) But, for some reason I rather keep visiting the world of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" over and over again.As the film ends i go to sleep with a sense of melancholy knowing it's about to conclude and yet with a smile on my face to dream of such surreal, eerie, and fascinating world somewhere in the middle of nothing across the Mexican border desert.IMHO Quentin Tarantino (screenplay), Robert Rodriguez (direction), and Robert Kurtzman (story) have become legends and immortalized themselves with this single piece of fascinating and surreal film. Huge credits also to Mexican cinematographer Guillermo Navarro (Pan's Labyrinth cinematography Academy Award winner) and the art direction staff for crafting such a magical realm in and out my favorite fictitious coolest bar ever created the ""Titty Twister"" built atop a semi buried Aztec pyramid it's pure magic.11/10",From Dusk Till Dawn
506,bewarerapture,Where are you taking us? Mexico. What's in Mexico? Mexicans.,8,7 July 2009,"Mental. Absolutely mental. That's how I'd sum up From Dusk Till Dawn. Revolving around the Gecko brothers and their attempts to cross the Mexican border to safety by using a family and their motorhome the first half provides us with a really compelling action film in a similar vein to Tarantino-directed films. What then occurs is camp, B-movie style, splatter, vampire nonsense pretty much until the conclusion of the film as Clooney and friends attempt to escape the bar with their lives intact. Weird..but I love it! Yes the switch in genre is surprising but it works and I applaud Rodriguez for daring to do such a thing. Many people have criticized FDTD for doing this but in my opinion the switch is a refreshing change. There are countless films that go along the same way as FDTD was going but there are not many films that dare to do this.It's easily Rodriguez' best effort to date and really shouldn't be viewed as anything but good fun! Clooney is fantastic in the first half of the film (as is Tarantino) although both of their performances do get a little shadowed as the vampire mayhem kicks in. Finally, FDTD boasts a script filled with witty dark humour that had me laughing on many occasions. Bravo! 8/10",From Dusk Till Dawn

But, it was still good, and I was so hooked, I had to watch until the end even if that meant staying up until 3 a.m.I think I would have enjoyed this movie considerably more if it would have stayed on the ""normal"" hostage/crime thriller it began with. Because it basically went from being a believable somewhat psychotic thriller to being totally impossible and unrealistic.The ending, too could have been a lot better. I appreciate all the irony, and how you don't really know what happens to Kate in the end..yes, we see her drive off, but who really knows whats to come of her.

517,rustican_Slab,Must for Tarantino fans,7,24 July 2011,"Being a fan of Quentin Tarantino's writing and directing style I decided to give this film a try even as it being one of his less popular titles. I am very glad I did.From the beginning, the movie jumps right in and catches you with glorious original dialogue that screams Terantino. Two theft and murder suspects are desperately fleeing the country killing anything that comes in their way and taking hostages to boot. The two felons, played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, are fun to hate and are portrayed with the perfect amount of evil. A thrill to watch the pair on screen together. The movie will keep you guessing scene after scene.Words can't describe how big of a turn the movie takes about half way through. It's like the original writing and directing crew stopped working in the middle of filming and handed it off to a completely different set of hands to finish. If you aren't familiar with the film the first time around like me, you will be utterly shocked at the turn it takes. We go from a criminal action/drama to a sci-fi horror in the blink of an eye. In other words, everyone starts turning into ""vampires"". I use quotations because they don't really act like vampires, more like zombie vampires. The creatures can barely speak and if they bite you, you turn to one of them...The end scene tends to draw out for me a little. All of the smooth and cool dialogue and story telling is replaced with cheap lines. Dramatic violence is replaced with mindless violence. It becomes a cheap slasher flick with less depth than the first half.Overall though, it was a highly entertaining movie. Tarantino dialogue, action, shock factor, cool vibe and unique style combine to make this movie an easy classic",From Dusk Till Dawn

The popularity of Tarantino's films is undeniable, but going into From Dusk Til Dawn I had almost no expectations. The movie was a Christmas gift from my parents, mostly my dad, an avid vampire enthusiast. I kind of doubted how much I would really enjoy the movie; I had sat bored through more than a couple ultra violence killing spree movies.That, I can say, has forever changed. It's kind of weird to even explain, because I'm still kind of weirded out as to what exactly it was about that movie that is so incredibly amazing. I can't decide if it's the sick and twisted s*** perpetrated by Richard the delusional and pedophile rapist, who drinks whiskey off the foot of (guys, girls, c'mon) Salma Hayek, or the holy water flamethrower, the groin six shooter, or the first time you see a human turn into a vampire on screen, or the pounding in your chest as the tension rises indefinitely as two children and one man face off against a bar full of hungry bloodsuckers. Seriously, this is an amazing, one of a kind film. It's unlike anything you'll see anywhere else.

The only problem with the movie that i could find was the sudden switch from reality-action to fantasy-horror, which happened in seconds and made the second half of the movie faster paced and unrealistic. I think that Rodriguez had a hard time choosing between a film about reality or fiction and that is where the movie fails.Myself being used to Rodriguez and Tarantino twists found it typical of their writing style, but to others unfamiliar with some of their work the movie's second half might seem rushed and filled with gore for the sake of gore.I praise Clooney and Tarantino for the flick's first half, their characters were believable and intense!",From Dusk Till Dawn

A classic Tarantino-style crime drama/thriller (here people with self esteem issues tend to think ""this is good enough for me the intellectual light of this world"") and then it turns into one hour of old school 70'ies style zombie slashing (this is where those people think it has seized to be good enough for their highnesses). The second part is clear tribute to those old movies and it does the job.My disdain for haters of this movie could not be bigger cause they clearly don't understand this movie. It's not trying to be anything more than entertainment and if it is anything it's that. It's so incredibly funny, confusing, gory, crazy, etc. that I clung to the screen for two hours straight.Both parts of the movie are great in their genre and their combo is something you've never seen before.

I've got a close friend who's a clinical psychologist, and one of his techniques for helping patients deal with manipulative co-workers, narcissists, etc., is likening those 'bad' people with vampires or werewolves. He uses movies a lot in his therapy. I told him one time about this movie--in pretty serious detail--and he ran out and bought it. He said it's now a major part of his work. He was fascinated with the relationship between Seth and the defrocked minister; how the whole bar turned from a fun place into a nightmare; and even the weapons used as being appropriate for the characters.

After they cross the border into Mexico to avoid the police and FBI, they go to a not so family-friendly bar to meet their accomplice in the robberies.Then the entire movie falls apart.It turns out that all of the people that work in the bar are secretly vampires, and an ultra-gory biting and stabbing scene follows, complete with decapitating and removing beating hearts.Now don't get me wrong, there are some well choreographed vampire fight scenes in this movie that can be attributed to director Rodriguez, but the transition between the Gecko Brothers escaping to the vampire hunting is so choppy that it feels like two completely different movies just crammed together.

It would only be fair to give credit where it is due, so I will agree that at times the movie employs some interesting dialogue. At times, the actors deliver that dialogue quite well.Ultimately, though, a movie is about story. Writing a great character or an interesting dialogue exchange and plopping them in the middle of a terrible story does not salvage the terrible story. Adding novelties (like Sex Machine's special wardrobe feature) doesn't either. This is a great example of how twists in a story can sometimes harm rather than enhance it.

He is great playing three different characters. He actually steals the movie from the other actors!",From Dusk Till Dawn

Alright all jokes aside let's get to where it is really at with this movie. It starts like any other crime movie would. There is some explicit scenes, some murder an explosion. But then they kidnap a preacher and his family. This is when my pants got tight at this point I had to pause the movie and rub myself because I wasn't prepared.Then it all goes down when they get to Mexico. At that point I was like roll the credits we made it. But we did not, me and my nipples where not ready for the brutal rubbing that lay before us.The res of the movie you're just going to have to watch yourself because I can't explain it. But one thing they talk about pussy a lot but there are not cats. Total let down took of a star for that.",From Dusk Till Dawn
539,JackBeauregard31,Not a Scary Vampire Flick,5,13 November 2015,"To steal from a well-known line: Dying is easy; vampires are hard.Most folks will be seeking out this movie in search of a good monster movie — unfortunately, the scariest stuff happens before the vampires even enter the picture. There's a lot to like here: Harvey Keitel and, surprisingly, Quentin Tarantino put in good performances, and there are a lot of great scenes and good writing. But once the movie clicks into vampire mode — which, let's face it, is why we're watching this in the first place — Rodriguez seems to become a directorial zombie.It's as if he worked so hard on the first half that he was plum too tuckered out to maintain the film's edgy excellence. More than anything, it's a problem of quality control. Everything in the second half suffers due to a steady stream of irregularities and lazy execution. For example, everyone knows (and the movie acknowledges this) that vampire stories come with certain ""rules"" — holy water, stakes in the heart, that sort of thing. But here, one person will almost instantly turn into a vampire after a bite in one scene, while another character will have ""about an hour"" before he changes in a later scene. The vampires even look different in terms of their makeup from one to another, both as ""living"" vampires and when they're killed.All of the inconsistencies pile up on one another until the action devolves into something bordering on camp. Whereas in a truly scary picture you'll be on the edge of your seat wondering when the next attack is coming, here there were scenes where you could literally see vampires in the background sort of dancing in place, waiting for the stars to say their lines before they finally attacked.Lazy, lazy, lazy.It's a shame: The goodwill earned by this movie's truly eerie and suspenseful first half is effectively frittered away by the inattention to detail that follows, and not even the clever ending can redeem it.Unlike some other viewers, I have no problem with the sort of portmanteau thriller/monster-movie construction the filmmakers attempted here. But vampires that aren't frightening? Oh, the horror.",From Dusk Till Dawn
540,eleniveroni,Worst Plot Ever. The actors must be ashamed,1,30 June 2017,"So I thought ""Hey, Clooney and Tarantino, how bad can it be?"" It was the worst movie ever! Full of clichés, stereotypes, plot holes and even stripper-vampires!Until 50:00, it was a relatively good movie,with villains, psycho - sex offender brother, kidnappings, of course there were many unanswered questions, but it was fairly entertaining. All if a sudden, the dancers in the strip club turned into vampires and started attacking everyone. The ways you could kill them were the classic stabbing in the heart, crosses, sunlight etc. Not only was it cliché, but the characters reactions and behavior towards each other were everything else but normal. This whole family must have had Stockholm Syndrome. Nothing else can explain why they didn't kill their kidnappers, but instead helped them. They even sacrificed themselves! In the end, Seth and Kate defeat the evil beasts/strippers/vampires, Kate's family is dead but she doesn't even blink, also Tarantino(G.Clooneys brother) is dead, but he, the vengeful criminal, just lets it go by demanding a bigger percentage of the earnings from the bad guys. And here I sit, wondering:HOW THE F**K DOES IT HAVE A SCORE OF 7.3/10?",From Dusk Till Dawn
541,devils_soul,From Dusk Till Dawn - Gory Good Time or Schlock With A Budget?,9,7 February 2019,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a 1996 action horror film edited and directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by writer and director of Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino, and make-up artist Robert Kurtzman. It stars George Clooney in his first lead film role, Quintin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, and Ernest Liu. Also starring in supporting roles are Fred Williamson (M*A*S*H, Black Caesar), Tom Savini (make-up effects artist for Friday the 13th and various George A. Romero films), and Robert Rodriguez regulars Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo, and Salma Hayek. The story follows two criminal brothers, played by Clooney and Tarantino, and their hostage family (Keitel, Lewis, and Liu) arriving at a bar in Mexico for temporary refuge, only to find out it's a vampire den. From there, they must survive the night until the brothers' contact can meet them in the morning. Upon its release, reviews could be considered fairly mixed, with critics like Roger Ebert calling it ""a skillful meat-and-potatoes action extravaganza with some added neat touches"" and other critics calling it ""a triumph of vile over content; mindless nihilism posing as hipness"". The film had a modest success at the box office, grossing $25.8 million against a $19 million budget, and has since obtained cult status. But is it really worth the praise, or is it truly nothing more than big budget trash?
As the movie begins, you're probably expecting a traditional cold open for a horror film. The standard ""killer gives the audience a couple intro kills before the credits"" type of deal. However, this isn't quite like other horror films. As it opens on a tense situation in a Texas liquor store, where The Gecko brothers, Seth (Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino) are introduced to the audience, the style and atmosphere is less vampire horror, and more akin to Robert Rodriguez's neo-Western action films El Mariachi, Desperado, and Once Upon a Time in Mexico (known together as the Mexico Trilogy). Now, while most horror film fans will be disinterested at this first half, which is where the film is more crime thriller than horror, it's actually a good way for us to get behind these characters, who are really bad people doing bad things. The first half shows their struggle realistically, as well as gives the brothers very humorous and distinctive personalities. The chemistry between Clooney and Tarantino is also very good, which makes them believable as brothers. This may also be the only film role in George Clooney's career in which he plays a true badass character, and not like his other characters who are only charming and charismatically awesome. Later in the film, for example, he gives some great one-liners that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger jealous and kills vampires in awesomely bloody ways. But, back in the first half of the film, we are also introduced to the Fuller family, consisting of former minister father Jacob (Keitel), daughter Kate (Lewis), and son Scott (Liu). They are on vacation via RV after Jacob's wife passes on in a car accident, an event which has caused Jacob to lose his faith. While Jacob's loss of faith subplot may seem to turn part of the film into a faith-based film at first, it works well within the story, even leading to the use of ""I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name"" as a pretty cool line. Of course, the Fuller's end up coming across the Gecko brothers, who take them hostage and have them drive the RV through the border into Mexico without getting caught by the law. This whole first half has great character development between both the criminal brothers and their hostage family, good humor, and fantastic acting, especially between George Clooney and Harvey Keitel. The characters become likeable and sympathetic, and we end up finding ourselves rooting for these criminals. Then as they cross the border into Mexico and the second half of the film, the crime thriller starts to get left behind and the action horror starts to begin.
As the gang reach the rendezvous location, a dive bar called the Titty Twister (yes, it's THAT kind of place), something begins to feel off. Maybe it's just how rowdy the outside of the place is, or the way the place is very out-of-the-way, or the very temple-like interior, or maybe it's the ""truckers and bikers only"" rule. Whatever the case is, the gang end up sitting down for a drink. After another great exchange between Seth Gecko and Jacob Fuller, we get to the part everyone remembers. The infamous dance scene of Salma Hayek's Santanico Pandemonium (a name which Tarantino lifted from the VHS cover of a Mexican horror film at the video store he used to work at) to Tito & Tarantula's ""After Dark"" is what is the most remembered scene in this film. From the dark and somewhat foreboding lighting, to the sensuality of the song, to the shots of the crowd being absolutely captivated (including some of Santanico's fellow dancers), to the freaking python around her, it's no doubt one of the most famous dance scenes in film history. However, the film can't all be this, since after Santanico's dance ends, three bar workers confront the Geckos for the previous outside assault of one of them. After they seemingly dispatch them, Richie's reopened hand wound stirs something in Santanico and with that, we finally get our first vampire.
The vampire makeup and the following gore effects during the bloody massacre of the patrons were designed by co-writer Robert Kurtzman, as well as Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger. Nicotero and Berger would later work on future Rodriguez projects, as well as The Walking Dead TV show, so you know these effects are the best of the best. Though some of the shots of the vampires melting away during death look very cheesy, it fits well with the B-movie tone of the film, so it's not too distracting from the rest of the practical effects and incredible makeup. It is here, when the bloodsuckers are revealed, that the film becomes somewhat of a vampire version of Assault on Precinct 13, which is fitting as Ernest Liu's Scott wears a shirt bearing ""Precinct 13"" throughout the film. It's also here where you can see that this film is more action than straight-up tense and terrifying horror, with the gang dispatching vampires via pool cues and table legs as wooden stakes, as well as one character wielding a whip.
As the gang, along with two bikers named Frost (Williamson) and Sex Machine (Savini), prepare to survive the night, we get more of the great dynamic between Seth and Jacob, as well as a humorous conversation on what can and how to kill vampires. It's here that I have to again commend the acting in this film. It's superb for the type of film this is. These great actors could just as easily phone all this in, but they give it their all, despite the story's tone and subject matter. While I'm at it, the cinematography in this is also very good; even though it does borrow various Tarantino-esque camerawork styles. But the action is shot very concise and clear, making it easy to make out.
As the film approaches the final act, it's all the crazy B-movie vampire fighting action you want to see. Here, we get a makeshift cross out of a baseball bat and a shotgun, holy water balloons out of condoms, and George Clooney wielding a stake mounted on a pneumatic drill. It's fun, ridiculous, gory, badassness from start to finish. By the time everything wraps up, the film has dished out a beautifully, albeit flawed, thrill ride.
Though much praise has been sung so far, it's time to look at some of the cons. One of them is Richie's tendencies to rape. While it is never shown, it's discussed a few times in the first half, but not in any fully graphic detail. Ultimately, however, this really doesn't do much to add to the story at all, and could be considered unnecessary. As much as the main characters are fleshed out, the supporting cast sometimes feels almost sidelined, even to the point where Fred Williamson's Frost never has his name stated in the film until the end credits. As said before that the first half is very different from horror, and the second half is more action horror than tense and terrifying horror. This very much alienates any traditional horror fans looking for something along the lines of 30 Days of Night or Blood for Dracula. The B-movie feel would also lose people looking for something more serious and suspenseful. Some may find some of the close-ups of T&A (mostly T) at the Titty Twister sleazy, but it stills fits the B-movie, drive-in, grindhouse-like style. As does the graphic gore. The film's shift in style can be very jarring and both halves feel like very different movies. The film also suffers from a few uneven pacing issues because of this, as well.
All in all, From Dusk Till Dawn may have some problems, but the B-movie action horror tone and its' style is something that you really just don't see in modern cinema anymore, or at least not done too well. If anybody can do movies perfect for drive-in spectacle like this, its Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. And it is something they would later prove again and again on other projects. However, where the film fails, it makes up for by having great characters, bloody good action, a damn good soundtrack, and makeup effects that are both awesome and scary. If you're looking for a fun, big budget B-movie full of action, humor, and blood, look no further because this party is open from dusk till dawn.",From Dusk Till Dawn

You see Harvey Keitel, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, but you can't place it among their more familiar efforts, especially if you missed the opening credits and you don't have a channel guide.By this point you are hooked in what seems like a crime-spree/hostage/road flick. The journey surprisingly leads to a biker bar/roadhouse/strip joint in the middle of nowhere Mexico, where Salma Hayek performs what is perhaps the most erotic snake dance ever committed to film. Without fully stripping, she dances on a table, slips off here heels, puts her bare toes in Tarantino's mouth and pours liquor that runs down her leg into his mouth.All of a sudden, the bar denizens turn into vampire ghouls and all hell breaks loose, with plenty of gore.

The second half of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was an absolutely terrible vampire movie with no plot or redeeming action, but to stick it onto the first half of a completely different movie was a horrendous move.

What starts as a simple hick town robbery gradually sucks the viewer into the gritty desert border motel where the kidnappers have holed up. So far so good - the rape and subliminal flash violence is unsubtle and expected from Tarantino. The delightful irony of the sex attack and the subsequent capture of the virginal ""fallen preacher""'s daughter sets the mind to thinking of a psycho type sexual thrills movie. When the violence does erupt after the heavy macho bar room brawl scene it comes as a a delight that its not sex its vampire stuff you never dreamt of at the start. Even after all the vampire stuff and the final blow out with the bats, Tarantino saves the final little little kicker for the wide angle shot of the ancient temple at the end - we've only seen the tip of the iceberg!
