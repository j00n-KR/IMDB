0,Leofwine_draca,"Familiar, but likeable enough",6,19 August 2020,"FIGHTING WITH MY FAMILY is a fun little film that tells a story so quirky and unbelievable that you just know it has to be true. The remarkable Florence Pugh - in another complete turnaround from the kind of role she played in MIDSOMMAR - essays the role of a Norwich-born amateur wrestler who gets a chance to join the big time, heading to America to join WWE. It's a typical rags-to-riches story that perhaps is a little too predictable for its own good, hardly making waves, but it's also likeable enough and well-handled by talented writer/director Stephen Merchant. Cast-wise, British stars like Nick Frost and Lena Headey enjoy their typically offbeat larger than life roles, but the funniest turns go to Vince Vaughn and Dwayne Johnson, who have less screen time but make the most of every moment.",Fighting with My Family
1,SnoopyStyle,Who the hell are you?,7,14 May 2019,"Ricky (Nick Frost) and Julia Knight (Lena Headey) are the parents of Saraya (Florence Pugh) and Zak (Jack Lowden). The wrestling family runs an amateur wrestling circuit in small town Norwich, England. When the WWE arrives in London, Saraya and Zak are invited to an audition. Coach Hutch (Vince Vaughn) is the judge.This is a WWE film about the real professional wrestler Paige. It's a great family and solid family drama. I love the loving family and everyone in it. I love their relationships and the troubles in their relationships. I love Paige's relationships to the other wannabe wrestlers. The Rock is pretty cool, too. There are two issues. One is very minor. It comes when Paige gets called a witch in Hogwarts. It was an opportunity to up the ante. Paige is flustered but she is given nothing to say. It could have elevated the tension by having her go overboard. She could have called them strippers. She could have called them fake wrestlers. The key to tension is elevation. She could have gone up another level. The other issue is much bigger. The movie tries to conclude with a traditional sports movie ending of the big game. It's not going to work in this case. While they're sensitive to being called fakes, the wrestling outcome is scripted. It's not like Paige could actually win the match. It's not a match. It's a performance. The true climax is actually when the champion asks Paige, Who the hell are You? It's the emotional climax and a better writer would understand that. It is the only real battle in the movie. Who is she? It's usually the most important question. I don't know what she actually said in the real WWE but the movie version should have her say that she is the daughter of Ricky and Julia. Her brother is Zak. Her father was a criminal. Her mother was homeless. Wrestling is their lives. She represents them and everybody who had to struggle to make their dreams come true. That's the emotional punch and the movie can end right there. A closing text can tell whatever the rest of the story. It doesn't matter whether she wins or loses for the story. It matters that she knows who she is.",Fighting with My Family
2,Prismark10,Fighting with My Family,5,14 November 2020,"Based on the real life story of WWE champion Saraya-Jade Bevis who fights under the stage name Paige.Fighting with my Family has all the hallmarks of a concept movie that is brought to life to the screen with all the tropes of an underdog story. It has no originality whatsoever in the screenplay. In fact Google Maps was hired to give turn by turn directions.Paige (Florence Pugh) comes from an oddball wrestling mad family from Norfolk. Her parents run a small independent promotion and Paige has been wrestling since she was a kid. Her older brother Zak is regarded as the more talented wrestler but when both go for a trial at a WWE event in London. Paige is selected to go to the USA at wrestling boot camp.In America, Paige is a fish out of water. She is a Goth with an English accent with wrestling in her DNA. She is competing against blonde models and cheerleaders who are there for their looks and bodies rather than wrestling ability.Hutch Morgan (Vince Vaughn) is the tough coach to put everyone through their paces and if you have enough, he wants you to quit.As Paige struggles to get along with people in America. Her brother Zak has to deal with rejection knowing he will never be a big time wrestler.Hutch tells Paige stories of what it feels like to be a journeyman in a top wrestling promotion such as the WWE. The sacrifices you make both physically and personally. Leaving you to wonder if it was all worth it and wanted to save Zak from all that.Dwayne Johnson makes a cameo as the Rock. He was the Executive Producer of the movie and is a friend of Director Stephen Merchant.However it tries too hard to be quirky, hip and alternative. I felt that Paige's parents played by Nick Frost and Lena Headey were broad caricatures than real people. It was watchable enough but it never amounts to anything like Rocky.",Fighting with My Family

4,kosmasp,With and for ...,9,25 January 2021,"But importantly full of heart! Paige ... you may know her or you may not. Although there are maybe some who became aware of her through a scandal that had her in the middle of it. And that has nothing to do with wrestling or the main competitor of the WWE at the time with her husband being in the middle of it. But enough of that and gossip or whatever you want to call it.I was not aware of her story and how she struggled to come to WWE, but the biopic on hand here lays it out. And while I'm sure there are some dramatizations on certain things or how they occured, the movie is not afraid to show some ugly sides. Or play with the cliches it build itself (the hollow blondes with ... well let's say just the looks ... but is that true?)! And that makes it riveting watching.What I also did not know, is that Stephen Merchant directed this ... color me impressed. Very well done sir. Which may explain certain quirks here and there. It is a really refreshing and quite enjoyable view on one person and her way to the WWE ... but it also is rough and tells stories that maybe not everyone wants to hear (you only have to really believe in something and it will come true?) ... Maybe there are messages that you do not approve of, but the movie is as entertaining as it gets",Fighting with My Family
5,zardoz-13,One of the Best Wrestling Comedies,10,12 March 2019,"Although Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson gets top billing in British writer & director Steven Merchants' amusing but insightful wrestling biography ""Fighting with My Family,"" he spends most of its 108 minutes off screen. In other words, if you're going to watch another of the Rock's conventional action thrillers, you're going to be sorely disappointed. Essentially, ""Fighting with My Family"" is the equivalent of a female version of ""Rocky"" (1976), and Merchant chronicles the rise of a female British wrestler, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Outlaw King""), who had dreamed since age 13 about breaking into the WWE. In case you aren't familiar with the acronym, World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., is what it means. Mind you, the WWE classifies their matches as dramatic because they amount to theatrical productions, with narrative-forged escapades orchestrated long before the talent tangle before multitudes. Approximately eight years ago, when Johnson was in the U.K., filming ""Fast & Furious 6,"" he saw a documentary about a Norwich-based family that held impromptu matches. He enjoyed it so much he contacted his ""Tooth Fairy"" co-star Steven Merchant about writing a screenplay about the Knight family's outrageous shenanigans. The patriarch of the Knight clan had wrestled professionally before he established a school for wrestlers that kept at-risk juveniles out of trouble.
As the title suggests, ""Fighting with My Family"" concerns a contentious, dysfunctional, working-class yarn about aspiring wrestlers. Nevertheless, this entertaining biopic isn't a generic, shallow account of the wrestling world that you'll forget once you've seen it. Indeed, this movie is all about female empowerment and the groundbreaking changes for women that Saraya Knight brought about as one of the youngest WWE Divas Champions. Merchant has created several sympathetic characters who experience change over time. Refusing to ridicule wrestling, Merchant has infused this factual story with as much blue-collar authenticity as if it had been made in the 196os, like the Albert Finney classic ""Saturday Night and Sunday Morning."" The dialogue is literate; the performances endearing, and the humor is often subtle but never crude.
""Fighting with My Family"" concentrates on the exploits of our heroine, Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh of ""Lady Macbeth""), who wasn't bitten by the wrestling bug until she turned thirteen and found herself substituting for an absent wrestler. Saraya's father, stout Ricky Knight (Nick Frost of ""Shawn of the Dead""), operates his own wrestling franchise in England. When Ricky isn't promoting tournaments, Ricky's second son Zak Knight (Jack Lowden of ""Dunkirk"") teaches at-risk adolescents, from public school to drop-outs, how to wrestle. Zak recruits all kinds, saving one teen from the misfortune of peddling contraband narcotics to lowlifes. Zak doesn't rate as much screen time as Saraya, but his impact on his sister's life is his prime contribution to the plot. Zak grew up watching the WWE. As a child, he could identify every wrestler strictly by their footwear. Obsessively, he had dreamed about wrestling in the WWE long before Saraya got converted. The WWE dispatches a gruff coach, Hutch (Vince Vaughn of ""Wedding Crashers""), to London in search of fresh blood. Saraya and Zak attend the audition with a carnival of other hopeful types in spandex. Tragically, Zak doesn't make the cut. Neither, for that matter, does anybody else, except his younger sister Saraya. Of course, she is stunned. Originally, she wanted to use the name Brittany, but the WWE already had a Brittany, so Saraya settles for Paige.
As Paige, Saraya dresses like a Goth girl: black apparel, black hair, with dark raccoon eyes. Later, during her first official bout, Paige encounters a defending champion who teases her appearance about her Halloween costume. Initially, Saraya refused to make the flight to train in Florida unless Zac came along, but Hutch refused to add her brother. Predictably, Hutch's decision crushes Zac. By all rights, Zac seemed like a shoo-in with his experience and demeanor. Over the ensuing 45 minutes, Zac struggles with the demise of his dream, momentarily careening off the rails himself in a bar fight until his older brother, Roy Knight (James Burrows of 2010's ""Robin Hood""), straightens him out. It seems Zak is a natural born teacher who inspires his students. Once Zak realizes his destiny lies with his family and the next generation of wrestlers that he can develop, he sheds his anxiety about his failure to make the WWE.
Meanwhile, Paige discovers training in sunny, faraway Florida is no picnic. She has to negotiate tough obstacle courses and flip over huge tractor tires to either shape up or ship out. At first, she alienates herself and dismisses a quartet of bimbo-like babes with golden California tans and statuesque figures. Paige's mother, Julia (Lena Headey of ""Dredd""), warns her daughter about such creatures who use their bodies to mesmerize audiences with their physical endowments. Paige dismisses them as if they were prostitutes, until she realizes that she has not only misjudged them but also herself. Hutch hovers over his recruits like a boot camp drill instructor. Constantly, he taunts them when they find the going desperate to take the easy way out and quit. Throughout these antics, Paige struggles to fit in with her cohorts, eventually dying her mane blond and spraying on a golden tan. Ultimately, it doesn't take long for our heroine to realize she cannot be somebody she isn't.
As Saraya's father Ricky, Nick Frost plays a supporting role in this cheeky comedy, but his presence makes an unforgettable impression. Wearing a shock of hair like a Mohawk Indian, Ricky is a motor-mouthed, down-to-earth, fellow. One of his best bits occurs when he auditions an aspiring wrestler who must withstand a direct blow to the face with a garbage can lid. Frost is contagiously hilarious, but he occasionally turns serious when Saraya isn't sure about her future in wrestling. The ensemble cast generates convincing charisma, and Saraya/Paige emerges triumphant despite her underdog status. ""Fighting with My Family"" qualifies as a memorable domestic melodrama as well as a first-rate wrestling masterpiece.",Fighting with My Family
6,grantss,"Good, and surprisingly so",7,20 September 2020,"Siblings Saraya and Zac have been into wrestling for as long as they can remember. Born into a wrestling-mad family they now run a wrestling clinic for kids and take part in the regular wrestling shows and tournaments their parents produce. Their chance to hit the big time arrives when the WWE has auditions in the UK. Could this be their big break?Thanks to the trailer, I had very low expectations for this. The trailer made the film look very silly and low brow. I wouldn't have watched if it wasn't for a friend pointing out that the film is nothing like the trailer and is far better than it seems.Turns out they were right. Rather than lowest-common-denominator slapstick the plot is interesting and is complete with some great, clever humour and an engaging warmth. Moves at a good pace: the time just flies by.All this aided by some solid performances. Florence Pugh is great as Saraya and she is ably supported by Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Jack Lowden as her family. Even Vince Vaughn, usually the kiss of death for any film or TV series, puts in a solid, engaging performance.All this coming from someone who is not into WWE or wrestling at all.On the negative side, it does end feeling like just another Rocky remake. Still, it was a funny and interesting journey getting there.",Fighting with My Family

9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The Merchant of Venice enters the ring.,7,2 March 2019,"Like all good 'sports' (or 'activity') movies, 'Fighting With My Family (2019)' cuts to the heart of its story and appeals to all audiences, whether or not they're fans of its focal pastime. In this case, that pastime is wrestling, which I have a passing knowledge of but no real deep affinity for - or, indeed, understanding of. Yet, this flick had me gripped, even during the purely in-ring segments. It follows a familiar 'rags to riches' story but sprinkles, unsurprisingly, a hefty dose of family drama on there, too. It's characters are crafted to be likeable, believable and flawed. They're given a fair bit to overcome, which is why it's all the more satisfying whenever they do so. The stakes are also slightly unconventional, usually being more internal than is customary with the genre. The comedy, while sometimes fairly broad, frequently puts a smile on your face and often makes you chuckle. It adds to the overall entertainment value of a piece that isn't afraid to veer into slightly darker territory. The narrative itself is clean and constantly forward-moving. The only real issue is the somewhat rushed finale, which makes the protagonist's shift from 'time to train' to 'this is your big shot' seem incredibly - and unbelievably - quick. It's not a huge issue, though, and the finish itself is satisfying, mainly because Merchant wisely chooses to hold his cards closer to his chest here. All of this makes for a winning formula: a feel-good, self-professed 'Rocky (1976)'-esque, funny yet heartfelt tale which might not be all that unique but earns its emotional beats and ultimate outcome pretty much twofold. 7/10",Fighting with My Family
10,ThomasDrufke,Crowd-pleaser,8,9 March 2019,"I love movies that open my mind up to a world that I was not previously accustomed to. The world of professional wrestling has never once appealed to me. A staged ""sport"" where grown men in tights throw each other around to compete for a ""title belt""? Yeah, no, not for me. But if there's anything I've learned over years of seeing hundreds of movies in theaters, you have to keep your mind open. Fighting with My Family is not only a huge delight and surprise, but one that did slightly peak my interest in at least giving wrestling a shot. Anchored by the producing presence of The Rock and even acting in a few scenes, Stephen Merchant carefully crafts the story of a family of wrestlers who have dreams of making it big, only for one of their children to win a shot at the WWE over the other. Florence Pugh plays ""Paige"", the real life WWE Champion who worked her way up the WWE to become the youngest champion at age 21. Pugh, who was brilliant in The Outlaw King, gives Paige a snarky but extremely charming edge. There's no doubt in my mind, Pugh has the makings of a future Oscar winner. While the film itself likely won't win any awards, it's the definition of a crowd-pleaser.8.6/10",Fighting with My Family
11,cricketbat,"Not a fan of pro wrestling, but I liked this movie",7,10 June 2019,"I'm never been a big fan of professional wrestling, but Fighting with My Family does a good job of making you care about the characters, which, in turn, makes you care about their dreams of making it into the WWE. I was really impressed by the performances of Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden. Yes, this movie is largely fictionalized but, then again, so is pro wrestling.",Fighting with My Family
12,ironhorse_iv,"For the most part, it was an entertaining movie. Short term, it's worth fighting for.",7,5 October 2019,"Written and directed by Stephen Merchant, the film is a fictional remake of a 2012 Channel 4 documentary of the same name. Without spoiling this unconventional funny heart breaking inspiration tale too much; the film about how Saraya Bevis (Florence Pugh) became wrestling superstar Paige was a bit jarring to watch with all the historical inaccuracies. For example, the movie simplified her pre WWE career to only working for her father's struggling promotion as always as Paige; when in truth, she work for many independents companies like Shimmer as Britani Knight. While I didn't mind that, I did think the movie could had shown that she was indeed unsuccessful in her first try out for WWE before getting the job later that same year. It would had add more to her comeback story and give hope to her brother Zak (Jack Lowden). Nevertheless, when she did signed her contract. She wasn't really assigned to NXT and its high tech performance center, but to then near dead developmental territory, FCW. It's here where she got the name Paige. Once again, I didn't really mind that, however the film kinda cop out by not showing any of her real cotemporaries. Don't get me wrong, I know that most of them are no longer in the company and that they can't use their likeness for the film. However, I really couldn't get with simpleton fictional character Jeri-Lynn (Kim Matula) when there is far more interesting and compelling side real-life individuals that they could had put into the film like Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch or Alexa Bliss. Just think of the stories, the movie could had with them. As for the lack of mention of her championships runs in NXT, it's alright as it build to her big win for the Divas belt from AJ Lee (Thea Trinidad) in the ending. However, that women championship is not that longstanding or well established as the film makes it out to be. In truth, it's a pretty pathetic title with a short heritage. So personally, the big win was not that interesting. While the movie did made the debut far more intense with fans jeering her and hard-hitting with actual match rather than a quick squash with audience already cheering. The fight was too clumsily put together. Plus, I kinda hate that Naomi and Tamina weren't there in the film to witness it. As for the performances. Trinidad was fine. She sound like AJ even if she didn't look like her due to Lee's trouble relationship with the company. As for producer Dwayne ""The Rock' Johnson, he was fine, even if he somewhat hogged the spotlight. His presence in the film wasn't really needed. It was also nice to see cameos from other superstars even if they don't really look like that at the time. As for most of the quirkiest about Paige's family. It was well developed and delivered. Nick Frost and Lena Headey as the parents & the cameos of the real-life family members were fine even if her older half-sister didn't appear or mention in the film. However, Pugh as the lead role was a bit of a disappointment. Her acting was a bit off playing the wrestler a little too aversion. Not only that, but her appearance doesn't really match the real life Sayara. She is far too short and chubby. Also her wrestling skills were not really athletic. No wonder, why the filmmakers got Tessa Blachard to do most of the stunt work. Honestly, Tessa makes a more realistic Paige than Pugh. Better yet, why not have real-life Paige play herself. Nevertheless, the true star of the film has to go to Lowden as Zak. His dismissal sub plot about having to makes peace with himself, not making it to WWE was highly watchable & very compelling. However, unlike the real life guy who appearance and wrestling skills are average. This character had a pretty boy facial look, well tone body and amazing skills on the mat. So it doesn't make a lick of sense why he didn't get signed in the first place. At least, the original documentary show that Zak suffer from a knee injury preventing him from getting hired. As for Vince Vaughn as fictional composite trainer Hutch Morgan. He was fine. Yet, I just don't buy him as an ex-wrestler. I just wish, the movie establish more side coaches like Dusty Rhodes. It just seem odd for one man to be fully in charge of scouting, training and hiring for a global wrestling corporation without much help. Nevertheless, they did a good job of not featuring then head trainer Bill DeMott in this film, as he later resign amid accusations of abuse, misconduct and sexual harassment. That would be uncomfortable. However, it's a topic worth checking into the future. The same with showing the turbulent in her life since joining the company such as her drug suspended, her scandalous love, sex life being made public and her getting career ending injury. It would give the sequel if they make one, more depth as this movie felt a little simplified. Because of that, I felt like the film could end up being highly forgotten in the coming years like the Paige looking dishevel promo popular internet meme. This movie would get lose in the shuffle. In the end, while is Paige's house now. In a few years, it will be a house of cards. Nevertheless, this biopic has very good insight into how crazy professional wrestling really is. It offers a rare glimpse behind the scenes of WWE, and a rarer glimpse of what it takes just to get there. Even if some of the themes about overcoming adversity and hurdles has been done before in other scrappy underdog sport films. It's a step up from the other WWE Studios films. At least, we can be all on the same page about that.",Fighting with My Family
13,Platypuschow,Fighting with My Family: What an absolute mess,4,8 May 2019,"Let me clarify, I'm a huge wrestling fan and have been since the mid 80's.
I'm a huge Paige fan and putting the controversial chapters of her career aside have always admired what she's accomplished. After all how many 26 year olds get their own biopics?I was surprised when I heard this was being made, but truth be told rather excited especially when I saw the cast. Florence Pugh, Lena Headey, Nick Frost! Sign me up I thought.So as you can probably gather I went in with very high expectations, rest assured they weren't met.Well made? Sure. Pugh played Paige well? Absolutely. Sadly however the flaws are overwhelming.Most of the casts performances feel phoned in, they're so underwhelming it's like they're not even trying. How can you have Stephen Merchant put in such a pointless neutered performance in? Why even cast him? Same could be said about most of the cast truth be told.Then we have the brother, I get it that the ""Fighting with my family"" turmoil and Paiges background is a core aspect of the story but watching said character spend the 90 minutes moping like a petulant child is not an enjoyable watch. The movie is about her, so why did it feel like he was a comparable male lead?So the performances are mostly poor, the story is ruined by the poor focus choices, Paiges attire is entirely different than what she actually wore, they skipped her NXT career and becoming the first ever NXT Womens champion! (Beyond belief that they did that as it was a pivitol moment of her career) and the biggest problem is still to come.What happens behind the scenes, stories that Paige tells that we can't prove whether it happened or not are fine. But when you rewrite history that we saw live on television and can be accessed by anyone at a touch of a button, you look foolish.No spoilers here, but for those of you who watched Paiges main roster debut and watched this movie might notice more than a few discrepancies. What were they thinking? They are rewriting televised history. And to make matters worse this was actually made by WWE, what were they thinking?For someone who doesn't follow wrestling and knows nothing of Paiges career they might walk away mildly entertained. For anyone who does they'll recognize this as a mockery, a clipnotes tampered with version of her career when it should have been a celebration.The Good:Great castThe Bad:Re-writes historyLeaves out major stages of Paiges early careerToo much focus on her brotherCast just don't seem to be tryingThey could have done SO much more here",Fighting with My Family
14,slightlymad22,Surprisingly Has A Lot Of Heart & Is Very Moving,8,31 March 2020,"I recently watched Fighting With My FamilyI have to say it was a pleasant surprise. The movie had a lot of heart and was surprisingly moving. Now I have no interest in wrestling and didn't know who a certain somebody was, so maybe that helped.I have to say Florence Pugh was superb, clearly doing a lot of her own stunts, she looked and acted so different in this, movie I didn't even realise it was her. She really starting to impress me. Johnson (who plays himself) isn't really in it much, I think it was 2 scene's (both about 5 mins each) Cersi Lannister herself is in it too, as Pugh's mother.Recommended, even if you are not a wrestling fan",Fighting with My Family
15,UniqueParticle,Great for anyone,8,6 March 2020,Florence Pugh is an incredible actress! I'm not much of a wrestling fan but this movie is awesome entertainment with beautiful cinematography and great story! Some of the scenes caught me off guard in a sad way which was unexpected. The acting is quite good Fighting with my family is very done it deserves the high ratings.,Fighting with My Family
16,tomgillespie2002,Celebrates the misfits,7,16 May 2019,"Wrestling movies don't come along very often, at least not those that take the sport seriously. Perhaps the idea of adults dressing up in ridiculously skimpy costumes and acting out a pre-choreographed fight is theatrical enough already, so a leap to the big screen would be ultimately redundant, or maybe the sport is simply too niche to guarantee a healthy return on a studios investment. But ever since The Wrestler put Mickey Rourke through the ringer, there has been a newfound respect for wrestling and the athletes who push their bodies to the very limit, particularly from those who have never sat down to watch a WWE event in their lives. Fighting with My Family continues this trend, loosely retelling the story of Saraya-Jade Bevis , aka Paige, who emerged from a working-class wrestling family in Norwich, England to become a WWE champion.The film begins in 2002, with wrestling-mad 10 year-old Zak Knight getting pumped for the start of a WWF pay-per-view event before his younger sister Saraya turns over the channel to watch her favourite show, Charmed. Fast-forward a decade, and the two siblings have embraced their parents' passion for wrestling and have adopted ring names of their own. Zak (Jack Lowden) has become 'Zodiac Zak' and Saraya (Florence Pugh) is now 'Britani Knight', and they perform regularly at their wrestling club. The dream of dad Ricky (Nick Frost) and mum Julia (Lena Headey) is for their kids to make the transition to the big leagues, and tapes are regularly sent off to promoters in the hope of catching their eye. They finally receive a call from WWE trainer Hutch Morgan (Vince Vaughn) and receive an invitation for try-outs, but after a gruelling audition, only Saraya, now using the stage name Paige, is selected.As Zak is sent into a spiral of anger and depression, Paige struggles to work out who she is in Florida's sun-drenched world of golden-skinned models. Somewhat an outsider even back home (outside of the close-knit wrestling community), she feels isolated, mentally unprepared for the rigorous workout schedules and the standards required for the big-time. Fighting with My Family often flirts with cliche, but this is a sports movie after all. It works by developing characters we can relate to and truly root for, regardless of how ridiculous you may find the whole wrestling craze. This is down to the combined efforts of writer/director Stephen Merchant, who seems like the unlikeliest candidate to helm a wrestling picture, and the cast, who are all entirely believable.Pugh in particular finds the right balance of inner vulnerability and the outer toughness Hutch no doubt signed her up for, and Merchant helps bring out these traits with the right balance of comedy, drama and sentiment. Frost is also perfectly cast, showing once again that he's a terrific actor in his own right and not just Simon Pegg's sidekick. For wrestling fans, there are plenty of cameos to spot, with Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson showing up for an extended cameo that may feel like a gimmick until you learn of his role in Paige's real-life story. Above all, Fighting with My Family is a heartfelt tale that celebrates embracing the inner weirdo and the sport that welcomes such misfits with open arms - if you're tough enough.",Fighting with My Family
17,cruise01,"Strong acting, plot, and a fun movie.",9,16 May 2019,"Fighting with My Family (4.5 out of 5 stars).Fighting with My Family is an energetic, fun, and good biographical sports comedy drama film. The film is based on a WWE wrestler Paige also known as Saraya. The film follows her younger years, when she was a child fighting with her young brother Zak over a tv remote. Her parents were encouraging them both on learning to wrestle. They have their own wrestling gym which they pick up kids and teens on the street to learn to train and be a better person. Paige and Zak get a call to tryout for the WWE. Which Paige gets in and her brother doesn't. Causing a little distant drama between them. Paige trains herself hard and tries to follow her dreams of being a professional wrestler.It was great plot and story about Paige. Her family lives in England. They were struggling with money. But they still followed their dreams of keeping their gym open for kids and teens to keep them away from trouble on the street. The drama with Zak being heartbroken he did not make the try outs. And Paige is going somewhere as her trainer sees something in her. It is a fun journey to see how she goes through training. She faces against other contenders which they try to cause drama. And her parents being inspiring while her brother falls into depression.The direction is fast paced, energetic, and it kept the story moving. It is an inspiring story. The acting is great. Florence Pugh delivered her role. She is great. Lena Headey and Nick Frost playing her parents were great too. Jack Lowden playing her brother Zak was good. Vince Vaughn playing her recruiter and trainer was great. Dwayne Johnson makes a fun appearance as himself.Overall, Fighting with My Family is a pretty exciting and good film.

18,eddie_baggins,Florence Pugh shines in this fun and different take on the WWE Film,6,23 September 2019,"A different type of WWE film that should please hardcore fans and newbies alike, Fighting with My Family may not knock it out of the ring but this fun, heartfelt and enjoyable true life tale is sure to bring a smile to viewers of all ages and backgrounds.Curiously directed by Office co-creator and awkward British comedian extraordinaire Stephen Merchant, Family sees the wrestling conglomerate steer away from dodgy actioners and movies starring c-grade actors to shine a light on the inspiring story of English WWE import Saraya Knight aka Paige, who took the industry by storm thanks to her fierce determination and steely resolve to make it in the cutthroat industry that chops and changes its roster on a more than frequent basis.Filled with a loaded cast that includes supporting turns from Vince Vaughan as hard as nails but caring wrestling coach Hutch, Nick Frost and Lena Heady as Knight's wrestle mad parents and a cameo from superstar (and this film's producer) Dwayne Johnson, Family is perhaps most notable moving forward as the moment its leading lady Florence Pugh officially announced herself as a leading lady of note.So good already in her breakout turn in the little seen but well regarded Lady Macbeth, the memorable TV miniseries The Little Drummer Girl and currently riding a wave of success due to her turn in buzzy horror Midsommar, there's little doubt that Pugh is quickly becoming one of the next big things in the industry and her committed turn here as Knight is a joy to behold.Perfectly balancing the act of being confident yet flawed and also self-doubtful as well as likeable and very funny, Merchant and Pugh ensure Family rides off the back of Knight and Pugh is more than up for the challenge as she turns from small time family oriented wrestler to a girl removed from her creature comforts and thrown into a world full of fakes and bloodsuckers.There are absolutely zero surprises in the journey Merchant takes us on in Family's runtime and there is a sense that everyone is made to be far too clean cut (such as how awesomely nice The Rock is) for this to be considered a true to life retelling of events but the core of the story remains enjoyable throughout and it's a credit to all that this wrestling focused dramedy is such an easy watch.Final Say -Sure to delight WWE fans of all ages and casually entertaining for the rest of us, Fighting with My Family is as generic as they come but thanks to its real life subject matter and Pugh's wickedly fun central performance, this is a film well worth tapping into.3 free hot dogs out of 5",Fighting with My Family
19,leonblackwood,Could have been better! 4/10,4,27 January 2020,"Review:
Although I found the true story about Paige/Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh) intriguing, I did find the biopic weak, and unfunny in places. Nick Frost (Ricky Knight) and Lena Headey (Julia Knight) was great as Paige's parents, and Hutch was a perfect choice as the coach, but the rest of the cast wasn't that great. I hadn't heard of Paige before watching the film, but it was obvious how it was going to pan out. I would have liked to have seen how her career progressed after her first win, after investing so much time watching how she went from zero to hero, but it seemed to have been cut short, even though it showed some real-life footage towards the end. After hearing good things about the film, I wasn't that impressed with the outcome, but it was good to see the Rock play himself, even though he was only in a couple of scenes. The film starts in 2002, in Norwich, were 12-year-old Zak Knight (Jack Lowden) is engrossed by the WWF (now WWE) King of the Ring pay-per-view event until his younger sister Saraya changes the channel to her favourite program, Charmed. The sibling's wrestle urged on by their parents Rick and Julia. Rick books the children for their first wrestling match where Saraya, initially reluctant to wrestle a boy, goes on to win as planned. At 18, competing under the ring name ""Britani Knight"", Saraya and her brother ""Zak Zodiac"" help their parents train prospective wrestlers while working toward their own promotion. Rick and Julia, struggling financially ask WWE trainer Hutch Morgan to sign the siblings. He finally agrees to a tryout before a Smackdown taping at the O2 Arena and tells Saraya to find a different name as they already have a Britani. The siblings receive advice from Dwayne Johnson, and Saraya adopts the name Paige from her favourite character in Charmed. The two try out with several other wrestlers and are all belittled by Hutch. He ultimately chooses Paige over the rest, despite her attempt to have Zak signed as well. With her brother's encouragement, Paige leaves for America while Zak continues wrestling on the British independent circuit, assisting his parent's wrestling school, and tending to his girlfriend and newborn son. Arriving at NXT in Florida, Paige has difficulty adjusting to the WWE style of entertainment, and she struggles with performing promos and Hutch's constant belittlement. Hutch makes it clear to Zak that he will never be signed to WWE, and Zak falls into a depression. Paige discovers her parents are selling merchandise of her likeness without her permission and have booked her in a match against Zak, scheduled for her Christmas break. At an NXT live event and her in-ring debut, Paige is heckled by the crowd and freezes up, leaving the ring in tears. She decides to bleach her hair blonde and spray tan to look more like her fellow trainers, which only causes more friction between them. After failing an obstacle course, Paige lashes out at the trainees for gossiping about her when they were actually discussing Kirsten, who has been away from her daughter in order to give her a better life. Hutch tells Paige that her brother's future in WWE would only have been an enhancement talent and signing would have ruined his life, implying that it did the same to him. Hutch encourages Paige to quit and return to her family for a happier life. She travels home for the Christmas break. Just before the match against her brother, Paige tells Zak she is leaving WWE. Angry that she is giving up the dream he failed to achieve himself, Zak goes off-script, defeats Paige and then tells their parents her plans to quit, devastating Ricky. After the family find Zak in a drunken bar fight, Paige admits that Hutch declined to sign Zak to protect him and he needs to focus on what is important in life, which is his family and coaching children who look up to him. Paige changes her mind after Zak berates her for giving up on their shared dream, and she returns to Florida, resuming her original hair colour and skin tone. She drastically improves in training, befriending and encouraging her fellow trainers. Zak returns to training his parent's students. Hutch brings the trainees to WrestleMania XXX, where Paige is booked in a suite with The Rock and learns she will make her Raw debut the following night against WWE Divas Champion, AJ Lee, as recommended by Hutch. Will Paige achieve her dream by beating the ruthless AJ Lee for the Divas Championship? You have to watch the film to find out! I was hoping for a deeper movie because the concept was great but I don't think that it was executed that well. The wrestling scenes were convincingly put together, especially Paige's athletic moves, but it wasn't enough to save the film. I'm sure the fans of wrestling will enjoy it, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Stephen Merchant, who also brought you Cemetery Junction in 2010. He's known for his role as Nathan in the office, and he has also starred in Hot Fuzz, Run Fatboy Run, Extras, The Invention of Lying, Tooth Fairy, which also starred the Rock, Cemetery Junction, Burke & Hare, Gnomeo & Juliet, Hall Pass, Movie 43, I Give It A Year, Hello Ladies, Logan, Table 19, Sherlock Gnomes, The Girl in the Spider's Web, Good Boys and Jojo Rabbit. He had a small role in this movie as Hugh, which was quite amusing, and he was lucky to have the Rock in the producer's chair. It's just a shame that it wasn't taken more seriously!Budget: $11million

20,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Quirky British humor meets Hollywood-style sports movie,7,28 May 2019,"Ome excellent casting and the work of a quirky comedic writer lift up what might have otherwise been a formulaic family sports drama in ""Fighting with My Family"" -and body slam it. Stephen Merchant, British actor, writer of the U.K. ""The Office"" and creator/producer of the U.S. version, offers the right kind of snark that a story like this desperately needs.""Fighting with My Family"" centers on a working-class family of World Wrestling Entertainment fanatics who run an amateur league and wrestling gym in England. Siblings Zak (Jack Lowden) and Saraya (Florence Pugh) have dreams of the WWE, and their parents (Nick Frost and Lena Headey) push them for reasons both good and selfish. When they both get a tryout to join the WWE's NXT training program in Miami, it's the opportunity of a lifetime.Lining up smart British talent (and comedic sensibility) alongside supporting actors like Vince Vaughn and Dwayne Johnson (as himself) creates a film in the mold of traditional Hollywood fare, but with more of an indie flavor. Fans of the latter will be more surprised by this, but there's common ground to be found in this movie between audiences who would choose different films at a movie theater 49 times out of 50.Narratively, Merchant tells a story that ping-pongs between formula and freshness. The freshness comes largely from the humor it keeps about it and the talent on screen. Frost and Headey are two tremendous talents operating in what are usually just stock parent roles in these types of films. They are also not written to just be any parents, but from the getgo, they give the story a bit of an edge as it unfolds true to form. As for Pugh, the film is lucky to have her before she becomes a major commodity. She embodies the rather straightforward sports drama struggle in a way that's compelling-she generates serious empathy and sympathy for a character who doesn't always deserve it.Clearly a fan, or at least an admirer of professional entertainment wrestling, Merchant neither glorifies the ""sport"" nor puts it under a microscope. He's interested in its truths, but also in subverting some assumptions that might be out there about it-that, like anything, it requires hard work and dedication, and a lot of subjective luck. Both the aesthetic and the message should connect with hardcore WWE fans as well as the less indoctrinated.""Fighting with My Family"" doesn't subvert the sports drama or family comedy, but it presents it with enough of a twist and the right talent. Merchant isn't a Hollywood guy, but he's making a Hollywood film, and consequently his movie both succumbs to and overcomes those tropes and pitfalls throughout. In that battle, the character development wins out, keeping our interest in the outcome while supplying a strong amount of entertainment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

21,southdavid,A Knight's Tale,7,4 March 2019,"Full disclosure first, I am a wrestling fan and I knew the majority of Paige's story and how the WWE and pro-wrestling works before seeing this.The Knight family love professional wrestling. It has changed the lives of Julia (Lena Headey) and Ricky (Nick Frost) and their passion has transferred to their three children, particularly to their son Zak (Jack Lowden) and daughter Saraya (Florence Pugh). Having grown up performing for the families Norwich based federation, a shot at the big time comes when both children are asked to attend try-outs for World Wrestling Entertainment.All that said, you don't really need to know anything about wrestling to enjoy ""Fighting with My Family"". It's a relatable story of someone from an unlikely background overcoming the odds to find success far from home. It's has a very British sense of humour, with lots of jokes with swearwords or about class differences, both between the Knights and Zak's prospective in-laws and between Paige and her peers once she's over in the performance centre. It probably has slightly too much swearing to be a real family film, but is still pretty gentle in its overall tone and themes. What makes the film successful is the performances of actors in the key roles. Frost and Headey are great, as is Florence Pugh, who continues to be a star on the rise after her performance in ""Little Drummer Girl"" last year. It's Jack Lowden, however, who has the most to do and excels with it, dealing with the disappointments and temptations that his life gives him as a parallel to his sisters.That perhaps leads to me the films biggest weakness, despite how unlikely it seems, Paige's journey isn't perhaps that extraordinary. She's way more talented and experienced than any of her colleagues but struggles a bit to overcome her own awkwardness. It's not so much an emotional rollercoaster as it is a jittering ski lift. To combat that, we get the opposing journey of Zak which, if anything, is actually more interesting, as he struggles with fatherhood, disillusionment and jealously before coming to terms and reconciling with his family.""Fighting with My Family"" is an entertaining and funny film if a little slight and though I can't imagine it's going to be anybody's favourite film of all time, it's a lot of fun to watch and I'm sure would be enjoyed by anyone.A little bonus if you are a fan of the UK wrestling scene from the past few years is spotting cameos from current stars. Dave Mastiff and Kip Sabian are two of the most obvious but there's a few more (and a dig a Pete Dunne which is funny, if slightly confusing).",Fighting with My Family

24,jtindahouse,Wrestling is not for me - and yet I loved this amazing film,9,7 March 2020,"I recently saw 'Ford v Ferrari' and hated every minute of it. I thought I hated every minute of it because I have a passionate dislike for motor racing. 'Fighting with My Family' is proof that that was not the case, because I also despise wrestling, yet loved this film. I couldn't believe how invested I found myself. I genuinely cared not just about the characters, but the wrestling outcome as well. If you'd told me I'd feel that way going into this movie I would've laughed in your face. Stephen Merchant is a genius.Back when Merchant and Ricky Gervais were working together Gervais was given the majority of the credit for their brilliant work. I have always maintained though that it was Merchant who was the true architect behind the brilliance, because what Gervais has achieved since Merchant left has been pitiful by comparison. Merchant's biggest strength is his structuring. He perfectly paces his films, gives every character the ideal amount of time to shine, and keeps the audience invested throughout. Then add in the fact that the man is hilarious and you have a perfect package. He is the most under-rated filmmaker working today.The cast in this movie is incredible too. Florence Pugh finishes off her almost perfect 2019. She is the glue that holds this film together. Vince Vaughan gets a role perfectly suited for him and nails it. I love it when he is given free reign to be as sarcastic as possible. He may just be the best in the business at that. Finally, Nick Frost is again in terrific form. He's hilarious and also immensely charming all at once. You can't help but love him.This movie is a comedy at its heart, but let me tell you it moved me a lot more than most out and out dramas manage to. Add to that how inspirational it is and you are left with an incredibly good film. I can't recommend this one highly enough. Make sure you see it, regardless of your interest in wrestling.",Fighting with My Family

This movie is based on a true story about a female wrestler and her wrestling family. Florence plays Saraya Knight, aka Paige. Nick & Lena are her parents, who had a traveling wrestling show in England that they performed in. The whole family wrestled including her 2 brothers-one was in prison for most of the movie for getting into fights-and there were even matches with the parents verses the kids. Vince plays the talent scout for the WWE, aka World Wrestling Entertainment, and when he announces on tv that there will be a new talent cattle call and all newcomers are welcome, Florence and her brother-the one that is not in prison-go for a try out. The movie is written & directed by Stephen Merchant, an actor that has a cameo in the film. There are several wrestling cameos as well. I'm not up on my wrestlers like I used to be but I did recognize Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and John Cena, and yes, The Rock is pretty much a cameo role-he has a couple of scenes-not like the previews make you think. As the end credits start, you get a look at the real Knight family.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, drug content, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.

28,alindsay-al,A Fantastic Feel Good Film,9,6 March 2019,"To start off this review I must admit that I have been a lifelong fan of wrestling, especially the WWE, but I just wanted to see this film from a non bias opinion and I have to say I thought this was a fantastic film. The premise of this film sees a young girl get a tryout at the WWE where she struggles to fit in. Florence Pugh plays Paige in this film and she is truly fantatsic in this film, she has to really carry this film on her back and she delivers such an emotional real performance. She is a really interesting person and this film does her story justice. The supporting cast is great too, Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is heavily marketed for this film, but don't go into this film expecting to see that much of him as he is used sparingly but when he is used he just plays himself and is so entertaining to watch. Nick Frost and Leana Headey play her parents and they both do a really good job, they are fun to watch and their chemistry together is really good. Vince Vaughan plays her coach in this film and he does a great job, he recently has been really impressing and it continues here with a very strong performance. But a real highlight for this film is Jack Lowden's performance as her brother, he goes through a very emotional interesting arc in this film and it suprised me how much much depth he was given in the film. The story of this film is really interesting as you see Paige's journey from humble beginnings to trying to achieve her dream, also as mentioned her brother's story arc is really good and interesting to watch. However, I know that there are certain elements of this story that have been changed and embeleshed to make this film feel more dramatic when they really didn't need to. The script is brilliant with a fantastic blend of drama and humour that makes this film feel so real and make all the characters feel like the real people that they are. The style of the film is great, it shows off the wrestling incredibly well and all the challenges she had to go through in an appropriate manner. Overall I really loved this film and think it is definitley worth a watch even if you aren't a wrestling fan.",Fighting with My Family

I had no idea who anyone in the film was (Rock aside) before starting it. In spite of that I really enjoyed the film. It is very funny. It is touching despite being highly predictable. And I love the brother-sister dynamic the film is built around. The film is stuff full of sports movies cliches but they are deployed in new ways. The film is very much like watching a storyline in professional wrestling. Everything was just so larger than life, broadly rendered to be an easy viewing.Unfortunately, I think the direction is quite garish, ugly in places. It seemed to be the work of a newer director who hasn't quite found his eye yet. This was a great film to watch on a rainy afternoon.",Fighting with My Family

The performances are fabulous particularly from Knowles as the father, Lowden as Pugh's big brother and of course Pugh - superstardom is surely within her grasp.

33,kirbylee70-599-526179,IN AND OUT OF THE RING,8,21 May 2019,"The WWE is one of the most dominating entertainment companies in the world today. What began as a small territorial wrestling promotion has developed into the largest wrestling promotion in the world. Not only do they handle championship wrestling on a near nightly basis they've moved into movies as well. If you don't believe that look at the career of Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock. But movies that tell the life stories of wrestlers aren't that common. That changes with FIGHTING WITH MY FAMILY.In 2002 young Zak and Saraya Knight argue over what to watch, a WWF pay per view or CHARMED. While wrestling in the living room to decide their parents, Ricky (Nick Frost) and Julia (Lena Headey), come in and rather than stop the fight correct their holds. Ricky is a wrestler and promoter of his own promotion. As the children grow they work in the ring alongside their parents with Zak (Jack Lowden) dreaming of the day he can join the WWE. Sister Saraya (Florence Pugh) dreams of being their alongside her older sibling.An opportunity presents itself when the WWE is set for a show in the UK. Zak and Saraya show up to try out under the watchful eye of Hutch Morgan (Vince Vaughan). Since they already have a Britani in the WWE Saraya must change her name and choose Paige after one of the characters from CHARMED. Things run smooth and the pair think they stand a good chance of getting in. But it is only Saraya that is chosen. When she refuses to go without Zak he convinces her that this is the dream the family has had for years and she agrees.Saraya now Paige shows up in Florida for the WWE's NXT promotion, a lower level wrestling promotion that grooms wrestlers for the main event in the WWE. She's not like the other female wrestlers, nearly all leggy blonde models. But at 18 she's young and ready to go and has more in the ring experience than any of them combined.Being different, being the odd one out, Paige doesn't make friends and it isn't long before her disdain for their abilities shows causing more conflict within the group. Hutch pushes her, seeing something there that many would not.Back home Zak has hit rock bottom. A new father and husband, his dreams crushed, watching his sister's star rise he's torn between family loyalty and jealousy over her chance at success. Ricky and Julia aren't much better seeing Paige's rise not as something that she herself wanted but more what they wanted for themselves when they were younger as well as her being able to help promote their own business now.As the grind gets to her Paige begins to wonder if this is what she's meant for. Are the dreams of being a WWE champion really hers or are they the dreams her family wanted? Can she handle not just the physical aspects of being a professional wrestler but the emotional ones as well?The movie is one of the most entertaining flicks I've seen this year. I was truly surprised by it. Not only did it tell the real life story of a WWE star (well as real as any biopic can be) but it did it with heart as well. You don't have to be a wrestling fan to enjoy this movie (though it probably helps). More than anything though I found myself laughing out loud (yes really!) more than once while watching the film. It delivers on so many levels. Superficial, probably but always entertaining.All actors here do a fantastic job of bringing what could have been cardboard cutout figures to life. Their hopes and dream can be felt, their goals achieved and crushed bring joy and pain and each one of them ties into the other to make this a movie not just about the star but the entire family. Not an easy task to achieve and yet they do.WWE stars like Dwayne Johnson, The Miz, Sheamus and Big Show also make appearances in the film and Johnson was also one of the producers for the film. WWE movies have been all over the place from good to bad. This is a good one and worth watching.",Fighting with My Family

Florence Pugh shows that she is on her way to an amazing career, but the folks playing her family are all good as well. Even though I knew what was coming, the climax got me a little misty.

If you've seen a film of this ilk, you know the progression, chapter & verse on where the story is going from frame one. That Stephen Merchant, a frequent collaborator w/Ricky Gervais on the Idiot Abroad series has decided to to write & direct this film is somewhat laudatory & his casting of Florence Pugh (an up & comer w/Lady MacBeth & the Little Drummer Girl limited series under her belt) is a boon but the undemanding approach to the material wears on you which can be frustrating since the doc footage seen at the end seemed to have promise as a feature in itself.

36,questl-18592,Fighting With Myself,8,10 February 2020,"I am not a wrestling fan. I was once. I can remember a time growing up when Wrestlemania was tantamount to the Super Bowl. But times change and we grow into some things and out of others. I'd lost interest in it prior to Paige ever coming to the spotlight and had taken the stance of, ""its fake, it's bogus, I don't know how I ever watched it.""All this to say how shocked I was to watch this and LOVE it. Fighting With My Family is a marvelously funny, touching and emotional story of a girl passionate about something and struggling to achieve it. The characters are all rich and nuanced and I feel like we learn the exact right amount about each of them. It's based on a true story and, while some of the details are changed, as is often the case, the broader strokes are all pretty accurate.Florence Pugh is remarkable here. It's crazy to me to think that I've seen her now in Midsommar and Little Women and yet this is what makes me finally fall in love with her. She is exceptional here and her emotional triumph is so powerful I actually got a little choked up myself by it even when I knew what was coming. Nick Frost, as always, is a welcomed sight, as was the Rock, birth of whom were wonderful. Jack Lowden as the brother has wonderfully portrayed conflict and internal strife.The only real downside to me is that this is horribly formulaic. It follows the underdog's triumphant success story outline to the letter. At no point does it surprise me or throw a curveball to make me second guess anything. Once it starts, you know the track you're on and it never once diverted from that.That's my only negative though. This really was an exceptional watch and given its readily available to stream on both Prime and Hulu, there's no real reason not to give it a shot.",Fighting with My Family
37,truemythmedia,Empowering and Fun,7,13 May 2019,"I've never watched wrestling. It's not that I have anything against the sport or the people that like it; honestly, I don't watch any sports. As my interest in sports is night nonexistent, sports films have always been a tough sell for me. Sure, I enjoy a few of the classics, like ""Remember the Titans"" and ""Miracle"", and I've enjoyed a fair amount of documentaries about athletes or athletic feats (I really liked the ""Andre the Giant"" documentary that HBO put out last year), but I'm never going to go out of my way to watch a sports film unless it gets wide critical acclaim, which, this one did.
I think the most important part about this movie is the overall themes, and while the theme of 'chase your dream no matter what' is extremely well worn, but in sports movies, it doesn't feel quite as cliché. I say that because the goal of every sports game/match/what-have-you is to win, right? So if the overall goal (to win) is the same, you can imagine that 90% of the themes in sports movies are going to be similar. That being said, this is about a young woman chasing her dreams to be a wrestler; that's not a story I've seen on screen before. How many basketball/football/baseball movies have I seen? I couldn't tell you, and like I already mentioned, I don't go out of my way to watch sports movies. This is a unique story, and it's true. At the same time, this film addresses themes not usually talked about in sports movies: what happens when you're told you aren't enough?
The fact that we see things from the perspective of a person that trained their whole life and made it big as well as from the perspective of a person that trained just as hard and doesn't make it is great. I think the way that this film handles Zak's disappointment is pretty poignant, and his sister's reaction to his disappointment adds another level of drama to the film.
I honestly didn't expect to like this film as much as I did. It's an incredibly competent entry from Stephen Merchant, and I'd like to see more from him in the future. Overall a solid entry into the sports movie genre, and that's coming from a guy who couldn't care less about sports!",Fighting with My Family
38,masonsaul,Fun and emotional wrestling movie,9,4 March 2019,"Fighting with My Family is an incredible feel good movie that you don't have to like wrestling to enjoy. Florence Pugh gives an incredible lead performance and Vince Vaughn, Jack Lowden, Lena Headey and Nick Frost are all great. Stephen Merchant's direction is excellent with a good balance between the humour and more emotional scenes. The music by Vik Sharma and Graham Coxon is really good. The only downside is it ends too quickly.",Fighting with My Family
39,rgkarim,Do you Smell What The Rock Is Producing? A Quality Comedy/Drama,8,23 February 2019,"Another day, another chance to review a movie, and this morning's review is an interesting film that held much potential to be fun and unique. Sports movies seem to be the theme of this week, though this film certainly is not the typical approach to a typical sport that is portrayed in the film. Robbie K here to take a look at the British comedy about an American sports venue that continues to rake in the dough of Wrestling, and the hidden world that you might not know involved in the theatrical event. Let's get started as I take a look at:Movie: Fighting With My Family (2019)Director:
Stephen Merchant
Writer:
Stephen Merchant
Stars:
Dwayne Johnson, Lena Headey, Vince Vaughn
LIKES:Funny
Deeper Story
Training Montages
Casting
Good Utilization of Extras
Good Pace
UniqueSUMMARY:Fighting With My Family may not be the typical comedy given a lot of approaches with this movie, but my friend and I both did enjoy the comedy that was presented. It's a good mix of dry and wet comedy, utilizing slapstick, with witty English humor to bring some epic laughs to the mix that aren't shoved in your face. By not focusing so much on the comedy, Merchant's work was able to tell a deeper story about the WWE legend Paige, pushing into a number of elements that I had not expected from the trailers. Character development, major themes of family, friendship, dedication, and many other subplots actually work well to provide an engaging film that isn't quite the norm for this genre. In addition, it reveals the hard work that goes into becoming a wrestler, and how physically/emotionally demanding the application process can be in something that many do not even pass a look at.
The cast certainly does the job of bringing the tale to life with Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden crushing their performances with characters that drive much of the movie, the former in particular being the central pillar to base everything around. Yet secondary characters played by Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Vince Vaughn are utilized so well that they not only avoid overshadowing, but really mesh well with the main performers. Even the tertiary characters have some good involvement in the film, showing that you can utilize the cast well and tell a very good story, even with a super celebrity in the mix. Needless to repeat, but will anyway, this film utilizes its actors very well, crafting a family component. And it is all done with a pace that is entertaining to watch, not being too caught up in the drama to be slow, and yet still going slow enough to tell much of the story. Certainly this is a unique concept, but also a unique example of how a movie can be done.DISLIKES:The Inclusion of the Extra brother
The Rapid Development of Character Relationships at Times
The Rapid Story jumps at times.
Dramatization Vs. Facts
Semi Predictable
SUMMARY:Finding dislikes for me was a little harder than I anticipated, but here are few parts of the story that were a little off my element. While the characters were done well, the extra brother that got brought in I don't think was utilized as well. Yes, he has his place, but compared to some of the other characters, his arc had some drama and potential, but then kind of fizzled out compared to what I thought they were going to do. In addition, the movie surprisingly made some good character relationships, but then progressed them a little too quickly. I was hoping that there would be a little more time with tending to the flourishing relationship they were starting to build. This is primarily during the wrestling training period where things go from zero to 100% in a relatively short amount of time, and while still good I wanted more development with them in terms of that story arc. And because of trying to fit the tale in the shorter amount of time, the movie, especially near the end led to some hasty jumps that just as things were starting to develop were quickly transitioned to the next phase. Again, I would have liked a little more fleshed out conclusions and integrations, but it certainly is not as short sheeted as some other films have done.
In regards to the dramatization, well it works to add that Hollywood magic to jazz up stories, but I do understand that those who know Paige's story might want more fact than fiction. I can't really say I know the story, but the movie works well to blend the structures with that Hollywood magic to make it entertaining. If you are fans of the story of the youngest Diva though, then brace yourself for some potential divergence. In regards to the rest of the tale, the semi predictable plot is something else difficult to ignore, though again, the rest of the movie sort of offsets this component so it's only a minor area of improvement.
The VERDICT:Surprisingly, the movie worked much better than what I was expecting from the trailers. It's balanced on many levels, telling an entertaining story, with multiple levels than the typical comedy brings to you. With great use of characters/actors, comedy that is a bit diversified, and a pace that brings the wrestling world to life, you have a fantastic film to get lost into. Yet, there are still a few other components still in need of more time than anything else, to take those components they were building and strengthen them further. I enjoyed this film a lot to warrant a trip to the theater, but can understand if you want to reserve your trips to the more special effect frenzy that other films have going for it. Definitely look for it at home though.My scores are:Biography/Comedy/Drama: 8.5
Movie Overall: 8.0",Fighting with My Family
40,rannynm,One of 2019's Best Movies with excellent performances and apt direction,9,4 March 2019,"This docu-drama follows the incredible story of WWE superstar Paige, or Raya Knight (Florence Pugh). Born into a cheerful wrestling family, Raya and her brother Zak (Jack Lowden) get a once in a lifetime opportunity to try out for the WWE. Raya earns the spot, with Zak being left behind, and Raya having to leave her family behind to compete for the spot as Diva. With rigorous coach Hutch (Vince Vaughn), Raya will be pushed to new limits while Zak faces a test moving on from his dreams. These journeys push them to fight for their family and prove what truly makes a star.Florence Pugh becomes Raya Knight/Paige with her persistence and wit towards any obstacle being very inspirational. She respectfully adapts Paige and her final speech at WrestleMania looks exactly like its real-life counterpart. Jack Lowden does the same with Zak, my favorite character, as his character arc is so relatable with his struggles to move past his dreams of making the WWE, disregarding his own wife and child. Jack shows excellent range presenting Zak's eventual passion for helping others with his family's wrestling service and taking care of his child. Nick Frost and Lena Headey, as Ricky and Julia Knight, complete the family with their uniquely jovial, but lewd attitudes that only want the best for their children and other people in need. Vince Vaughn, as Hutch, is very impressive providing an inspirational mentor for Raya, as well in his real-life friendship with the Rock. Dwayne Johnson plays himself, enough said. In all seriousness, it is very entertaining and informative to watch his real-life impact on Paige.Stephen Merchant spectacularly writes and directs, with the events presented in clear chronological order. But the real standout comes from his snappy writing, as all the jokes and emotional moments land. He truly knows how to write human and relatable characters. My favorite scene is when The Rock gives Raya's family a surprise call. Dwayne Johnson and Nick Frost truly give their all in the funniest repartee, while also giving the feels with The Rock presenting his admiration and best regards for Raya. Still, with all the positives, I feel that the film doesn't acknowledge all angles to a boxing match and the matches here feel very simplistic at times. However, the film's main intent is to flesh out the family first and then get into the nuances of the sport, so this flaw isn't particularly egregious.The message of this film is that a person's character doesn't come from the title they hold, but by one's contribution to help others. Zak holds the strongest example of this. I give this film 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18 due to language and sexual references.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

42,Kingslaay,If you watch WWE this will be extra special,8,9 June 2020,Fighting with My Family is a great and touching film. A real rags to riches story of Paige. True wrestling fans will appreciate and notice the huge deal it is to make it in the WWE without any strong connections in that world. Learnt a few things about the road to WWE but wasn't super suprised by the intensity of it all and the politics. I also like that it was also a personal journey for Paige. This was not your standard outcast putting the other girls to shame who were not the real deal. It was a bit more realistic and had depth. Paige connected and learnt to deal with other girls outside her little british bubble and became a better person for it. We also the tensions within her family giving more meaning to the title. Also brilliant to have the Rock and other WWE stars casually walk through. Vince Vaughan is better at these movies instead of comedies.A great film with good buildup that made the climax that much more rewarding. Not only is this a great film but a nice nod to WWE fans. 8/10,Fighting with My Family
43,eric262003,Insightful Journey Plagued With Product Placement and Half-Truths,6,13 December 2019,"""Fighting with My Family"" looks into the comical yet inspiring journey of Saraya 'Paige"" Bevis who climbs out of her family's independent promotion in Norwich, England to become a WWE superstar. She would become a trailblazer for today's women superstars who are known for their equally competitive edge as the men and not treated like sex objects like they were in the ""Attitude Era"" and the ""Ruthless Aggression Era"". Although the focus of the the story is based on Paige's incredible climb to the top of a major wrestling company like the WWE, it's still feels like director/writer Stephen Merchant is taking this simplified tale in the formulaic direction of a sports underdog story of an individual who has to go against the odds to reach her fullest potential and has to work through those speed bumps in order to get there. Even though WWE CEO Vince McMahon is not listed in the credits of producers, the self-promoting of this billion dollar company is so frequent, it can also be quite monotonous at times. It's like as though it wants to continually endorse its promotion like no other promotions matters.The movie follows a similar path to ""Rocky"" as we watch Saraya (Florence Pugh) break free from the shackles of her hometown in Norwich, England before taking on the persona of her Gothic-themed character Paige and challenges herself as legitimate superstar in the WWE. Even though it's a sincere biopic, Merchant does make this film dependent on funny quips and hilarious one-liners to provide a little laughter for the tough road ahead of her. The cliched tropes that come in the story are in full force. We have the tough, but fair coach Hutch Morgan (played with humour and charm by Vince Vaughn). There is musical montage that comes into full effect while she's training. And then there's the climactic battle in the ring that is supposed to be attention-grabber. And sure it lists Paige's triumphs quite nicely, they tend to forget or skim through the hardships and scandals she's faced over the years. Such things like the failed drug tests that temporarily got her fired from WWE, her estranged relationship with former WWE superstar Alberto Del Rio, the leaked sex video, and the botched wrestling move by Sasha Banks that resulted in ending her wrestling career at only 24 years old. Everything depicted in this film seems like her journey was too immaculately displayed and seems so unnaturally happy-go-lucky that everything just comes at her without repercussions.It always helps to get viewers in watching ""Fighting with My Family"" is mainly due the trailer that is mostly displayed by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and his selling the product directly at us. With his charismatic catchphrases and his poetic diatribes, this will surely get viewers to see this movie. Even though he has creative control serving as an executive producer, he's role is generally just a glorified cameo. The main performer in this movie is Florence Pugh as the aforementioned Paige who transformed the wrestling ring to ""her house"". Pugh has shown some strong performances in her young career in movies like ""Lady McBeth"" and ""Little Drummer Girl"". Backing her up are veteran performers like Lena Headey as her mother Julia and comic actor Nick Frost who starred in another Merchant movie ""Hot Fuzz"" as her father Ricky. Vince Vaughn shows one of his stronger performances in a long time as tough coach Hutch Morgan and Jack Lowden gives the more dramatic sides to the story as Saraya's brother Zack who's jealousy and depression for failing to make the cut had an affect on his family and most of all himself.The opening scenes in which the emphasis is on the the dynamics of Paige and her family of traveling wrestlers who run a promotion in her native Norwich, England. Her family is obsessed with wrestling and as the youngest and the only daughter, she has to prove herself even harder that she can accomplish bigger things in life. Her father, an ex-con, after several years of doing jobs he can't keep, found his calling running wrestling tours where his family are main attraction. He also runs a training school for wrestlers to build their strength and character and his son Zack teaches. The opening scenes are as real as they are hilarious, by the film starts to fizzle once Paige gets chosen to wrestle for NXT in hopes to be on the main roster to be a part of either two WWE weekly branded shows, RAW or Smackdown. The sibling squabbles are believable as Zack feels his world was crushed when he didn't get signed and it leads to him falling in a state of depression. It's too bad that this dramatic side of the story is just an afterthought that should have been fleshed out more. Paige's sage advice to her brother about believing in yourself and being proud of the skin you own seems like it was recited out of an old self-confident manual.And though the movie as a whole is likable, it can at times be formulaic and way too squeaky clean at times. Pugh delivers the best performance as WWE superstar Paige, the comical elements in the story can be too frequent and leaves the dramatic stuff way too underdeveloped. WWE's banter is fully protected that it heavily relies on its product placement, even though it great that they acknowledge that wrestling is predetermined, they do seems to spare the details. Also in Paige's first match it feels like it was unscripted, but I have plenty of reasons to doubt. Like this sport itself, it may make you think it's all real only to realize not everything in the world of sports entertainment appears like you'd expect.",Fighting with My Family
44,vengeance20,Pretty epic!,8,5 March 2019,"Have sort of been a wrestling fan since I was a teen myself & have watched many of the episodes featuring all the greats including the man himself, Dwayne Johnson AKA The Rock!The film was pretty good! Very engaging. funny & entertaining all the way! The actors done well with the roles the were given. Florence Pugh, the main actress who played Paige was gorgeous as! Plenty of eye-candy for us lads sure! The dialogue was good if not a bit cliche & eye rolling in a lot of areas. The British jokes especially... But the film itself was enjoyable & didn't once have a boring un-entertaining part in it.This film overall is a must see for both fans & non fans of the wresting world! 8/10",Fighting with My Family
45,nancyldraper,An under acclaimed gem,8,3 January 2020,"They are calling this a comedy but I think it is just a great drama whose comedy lies in odd situations rather than in one liners (although, I did laugh out loud a couple of times). This has been on my Watch Next list for awhile, first because of Dwayne Johnson (who, really, just lends his name to the film), then because of the awesome Lena Headley, but, it made its way to the top of the list because I didn't know of Florence Pugh until yesterday, when I saw her notable performance in LITTLE WOMEN. This story has heart and you'll find yourself holding your breath for the underdog especially knowing these are avatars for real people. For these reasons, plus Florence Pugh's great performance, a fresh story that is gives more than it promises (and because I really enjoyed it) I rate this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Comedy/Drama}",Fighting with My Family
46,arungeorge13,"Feel-good movie of the year, most likely! [+67%]",7,4 May 2019,"When you make a movie about a relatively young ex-WWE superstar, you can commit several mistakes. You can make the movie more about WWE and less about the lead character's rise to stardom and popularity. But Stephen Merchant has come up with a solid feel-good entertainer. Paige is the lead character that we're talking about here. Come to think of it, it's as much Paige's movie as it is her brother Zak's. Detailing their journey right from 2002 to 2014 (post-Wrestlemania XXX), Fighting With My Family sheds light on Paige's family's interest in the wrestling business, how integral wrestling is to every conversation that they have and every decision that they take.Paige, original name Saraya, as WWE fans already know, is still the youngest DIvas (now Women's) Champion in the history of WWE. She was instrumental in bringing about the Women's Revolution, something that raised the status of women wrestlers over the last few years. There was certainly an inspirational story to be told here, especially considering how wrestling-oriented her background was. Now, the good thing is that the film retains its Brit vibe and humor even though it is set in the United States for a major portion. It even features a couple of scenes with The Rock (a.k.a Dwayne Johnson) that are laugh-out-loud.Merchant, known mostly for his work in The Office, has kept the humor situational and the emotions not over-the-top. He makes use of an excellent Florence Pugh, who doesn't overly try to mimic Paige or her mannerisms, instead, putting her own stamp on the character. The WWE backstage sequences and Performance Center scenes are staged well and gives viewers (who do not know much about WWE beyond the fact that it is scripted) a deep-dive into what an upcoming superstar's journey is all about. There are wins, there are disappointments, and most of all, there are moments of unending struggle.The emotional arc in Fighting With My Family is centred around the fact that when both Paige and Zak attend WWE try-outs in the UK, only Paige gets the call-up. While this puts Zak in a bit of a cold war with her sister, it takes time for him to get over the fact that she had a little extra zing that he probably didn't. Nick Frost and Lena Headey, who plays Paige's dad and mom respectively, provide support in the form of a steady dose of slightly-awkward humor and sentiment which the film definitely needed. Vince Vaughn, as Coach Morgan, is adequate.There could not have been a better time for the film to come out than in 2019 when Wrestlemania XXXV was headlined by the women's division. Had Paige still been an active wrestler, I'm sure she would have been involved in the storyline too. While Paige has taken to non-wrestling roles within WWE, her story is indeed one that needed to be told out loud, especially to a non-wrestling audience, and Merchant has done a pretty good job of it, I can say. It also reinstates the quality of WWE's NXT brand. The film is also one of the few WWE Studios-backed ventures that are truly worth the sitting.Predictability is something films such as this cannot do away with. And while it ain't no 'Creed', it does keep you engrossed during the entirety of its 108-minute run-time.",Fighting with My Family
47,Abdulxoxo,Great sport film,8,21 January 2021,"Fighting with my Family is a film which expertly blends drama with comedy. At times the story beats felt very familiar, in terms of being like many other underdog sports movies. There are training montages, inspirational coaching speeches, and a continual sense that adversity must be overcome in order to achieve a dream. The thing is though, even though it is familiar, I still thought all of those things were done very well in a way that makes it refreshing in this movie. Performances-wise, the ensemble cast performance is terrific. Florence Pugh is excellent in the leading role. She is absolutely one of the best young actresses around. In terms of the physical stuff she does and looks good. But it is the dramatic moments (of which there are many) in this film in which she shines.
Jack Lowden as Saraya's brother Jack also deserves some praise; he played that role so well. There was so much rage and jealously in him that his rejection would lead to a rift in the family. His character believed he would become a WWE Superstar one day. He truly felt like it was his destiny. You may go into this movie thinking that it's a comedy, but there are times when it's not afraid to get heavy and emotional and most of that is on Jack Lowden's shoulders. Lena Heady, Nick Frost and Vince Vaughn are memorable and do justice to their respective characters. Overall, an entertaining movie that doesn't require one with background knowledge of wrestling to enjoy it.",Fighting with My Family
48,martimusross,A Fabulous Heart-Warming Story,8,2 March 2019,"This movie is a true story based upon the Wright family in Norwich who found redemption in wrestling (almost a religion). After a period on the wrong side of the law Mr Wright just knew where his downward spiral would lead and to save his life, his marriage and his family he turned to wrestling. Mr Wright believed profoundly in the power of wrestling, its discipline, its camaraderie, its training, its teamwork to keep his family on the straight and narrow and if it could work for him it could work for the community to transform lives.The impossible dream for these amateur wrestlers was to make it ""big"" and be signed up for the American wrestling circuit. But to have a distant dream and then that dream present itself, and then see it through is quite a different thing.This was a carefully crafted movie with a tight script brilliantly acted by the entire ensemble. The two main leads Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden demonstrated an emotional intensity well beyond their years, we felt their pain and anguish and their joy and triumph.This movie did not descend into sentimental mush or become so British that it alienated its audience with puns and irony (believe me they were present). It was not so dissimilar to Eddie The Eagle or indeed Swimming With Men where sport was used for redemption and I sometimes even felt the influence of The Full Monty, where those crushed by life sought to rise up against the natural order, shouting I do matter!This movie was great because it went well beyond what the audience saw, it had a massive psychological backdrop, it had something to say about, dreams, family, teamwork, familial love, sacrifice, loneliness, redemption, community, disability and even the value of tough love.",Fighting with My Family

56,rockman182,Fighting With My Family (2019),7,17 February 2019,"Had to double take on the director and writer and make sure if it was THE Stephen Merchant writing and directing this film and it turned out it was so that was interesting. I used to be a super huge WWE fan from 1999-2011. By super huge I mean, I used to watch every show religiously and know everything about each athlete. I'm familiar with Paige through sporadic watching here and there and seeing her on Total Divas and am certainly not a fan of her or how she carries herself but this film was a fairly fun albeit cliched film.The film tells the story of Saraya ""Paige"" Bevis and her background. Her family are all wrestling crazed and put on wrestling shows and train others in Norwich. Paige and her brother get called up for a WWE tryout but only Paige makes the cut. Paige's brother is devastated and Paige must deal with the drastic change in her life and the hard road to living out her dream.Florence Pugh is already an established talent in my eyes because of her performance in Lady Macbeth. She's really fantastic in this, and disappears into the role of a WWE hopeful. The writing of Merchant and the care with which he gives to the comedy, the drama, and the heart involved in developing the characters is great. Its crazy to think that Merchant did not know a thing about wrestling before taking on the project. Side note: Merchant was in attendance at my screening for a Q and A and gave good insight into the project.The film can't help feeling cliched. Training montage, sibling rivalry leading to a profound confrontation that resolves the issue, and the underdog overcoming the odds. I find it weird that real life Paige was just given the WWE Divas championship on her WWE debut but whatever. Overall, the film maintains a good balance of comedy and drama and you don't need to know anything about WWE or sports entertainment to enjoy the film. Merchant does a good job.7/10",Fighting with My Family
57,RforFilm,It's a slam! Fighting with My Family is a fun look at this young woman and her crazy family,8,1 March 2019,"For a lot of kids and even adults, wrestling, especially WWE wrestling is the closest thing to watching real life superheroes and titans clashing. Sure, we all know it's a show and the callouts and insults are a part of it, but the smack downs and falls make everything look real and given the physique of the wrestlers, they still put in a lot of time to play the part and give us a circus of sweat and bruises. I don't follow it as much as I did as a child, but I have a lot of respect for the sport and show.Most of us know Andre the Giant, Macho Man Randy Savage, Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, Triple H, Big Show, John Cena, and the Rock. These are guys who've managed to create memorable characters that are almost as big as comic book heroes. But it's interesting to see what made them want to be wrestlers and how they managed to beat out other hopefuls. One such story not only focuses on the youngest woman to enter the WWE, but her family who are all die hard wrestling fans. That story is portrayed in Fighting with My Family.In the early 2010s, two English amateur wrestlers Rick (played by Nick Frost) and Julia (played by Lena Headey) and their children Zak (played by Jack Lowden) and Saraya (Played by Florence Pugh) not only love the sport, but even showcase their own matches and organize an after school practice. They also have dreams of having Zak and Saraya becoming a part of the WWE circuit with constant tapes sent in. One day when a SmackDown event is happening in London, they get a tryout with many hopefuls with WWE trainer Hutch Morgan (played by Vince Vaughn). Saraya, now gping by Paige, is selected, but her brother isn't.Paige flies to Florida for training camp, where she sticks out like a sore thumb, due to her looks and small frame. She also feels self-conscience as the other women selected look like super models. She's having trouble adapting to the WWE standards and training, and to top it off, still feels bad that her brother wasn't taken. Zac himself turns to alcohol and her parents start to make merchandise of their daughter's upcoming success. With a lot at her and moving really fast, she starts to understand that perhaps, wrestling is much more real then anticipated.Fighting with My Family does take a lot from other sports movies like the underdog plot, but as far as I'm concerned, I'm okay with that as this is really good. This movie made me realize that not only are a lot of women sports not focused on enough, but even more so in the WWE. Paige's story is not only inspiring, but the family she comes from is a lot of fun. The family's time needed to be shown in order to come out a little different from other sport movies.I really want to know what kind of training Florence Pugh went through, as I thought she was great. You really feel for her and her dilemma that she wants to be famous, but is afraid if she moves forward, then her family will be left behind. We all want to help our families, but it's understandable that things will get in the way as one climbs up the ladder. What's really going to help this movie's age is her family, who is one of the most unique families on film. They are trashy and have few manners, but they all care for each other and seems to want to help other kids that want that confidence. .One of the weaker points of the movie is Vince Vaughn. He's does fine in his part, but even with his no nonsense attitude, I still mostly saw him and not a character. I thought it was because of the actor, but I realized he was phenomenal in Hacksaw Ridge. Another problem is the pacing of the end which does show her progression after training, but it felt rushed compared to the slower first half. Perhaps there's more to the movie that was cut, but I think a little more time could have shown Paige the dilemma of suddenly being a star.I'll give this eight pictures of the real Paige out of ten. Something tells me that a lot of people, especially families, are going to like Fighting with My Family. Even if some accuse the movie as an ad for WWE, then so be it; it's like complaining that the use of the NFL in a biopic makes it an advertisement. It's a slam and worth watching.",Fighting with My Family
58,Anurag-Shetty,Entertaining & heartwarming.,10,10 April 2019,"Fighting with My Family is a biopic about Saraya Knight(Florence Pugh), her parents Ricky Knight(Nick Frost) & Julia Knight(Lena Headey) & her brother, Zak Knight(Jack Lowden). The Knights are a family of wrestlers. Saraya & Zak's ultimate dream, is to become professional wrestlers for the World Wrestling Entertainment(WWE).Fighting with My Family is a fantastic film. Writer-director Stephen Merchant has given us a flawless biopic that is hilarious, emotional & leaves the viewer feeling good at the end of it. The comedic & dramatic scenes have been perfectly balanced, throughout the movie. Florence Pugh is the star of the show as Saraya Knight. Pugh embodies her character perfectly, & is a young actress with a bright future ahead of her. Nick Frost is hysterical as Ricky Knight. Lena Headey is spectacular as Julia Knight. Jack Lowden is outstanding as Zak Knight. The family dynamic & the adorable chemistry shared between Pugh, Frost, Headey & Lowden's characters, is the highlight of the film. Vince Vaughn is brilliant as Hutch. The supporting cast is amazing. Fighting with My Family is a must watch, whether you're a wrestling fan or not.

Pugh wa able to totally embody her character and totally carried the film wonderfully. Vince Vaughn was also quite good. I really liked Nick Frost who gave one of his finest turns here and Jack Lowden also left a memorable Impression.

The central story is very relatable and it's easy to identify with Paige's struggle. I always found Stephen Merchant to be quite funny, however I didn't expect him to have so much talent behind the camera as well, given he wrote and directed the film. He infuses this true story with lots of sharp humor and sweet sincerity. The Rock literally plays himself in the movie, but it's Vince Vaughn who really stands out among a talented cast. Fighting With My Family definitely fights with cliches, but it manages to score a solid pinfall victory.",Fighting with My Family
67,CANpatbuck3664,Florence Pugh and Stephen Merchant Help Turn Fighting With My Family into a True Main Event,8,14 March 2019,"Paige is easy to get behind as a character and while you're rooting for her all the way, I did like the fact that the movie also doesn't make her infallible. She's dismissive of the other women trying out because of their physical beauty and their former jobs. Surprisingly, I came down on the other women's side of the argument (how often does that happen?). I also appreciated that her training wasn't a walk in the park and how her separation from her brother deeply affected her confidence. They largely handle her ""fighting"" with her brother in a believable manner, its easy to understand him being jealous, as is her response to his selfishness. The Knight family dynamic is pretty realistic, they're dependent on each other and they're bond is deeply rooted in their shared love of wrestling. So I like how writer/director Stephen Merchant approached the story and these characters, it was done with some care even if the minute details were tweaked.Fighting with My Family boasts a capable cast of veterans who know how to make the most out of the material presented. Nick Frost, Vince Vaughn, Lena Headey and Dwayne Johnson have all been around the bend and are all beloved performers for various reasons. They all have some laugh out loud funny moments at different points in the movie and its a credit to both their performances and to writer/director Stephen Merchant to get the best stuff out of them (Vaughn isn't amazing but I haven't seen him be this consistently funny in a long time). But this movie belongs to Florence Pugh and her work is the key reason that Fighting With My Family works as well as it does. She does a good job in the ring (despite not being a trained wrestler) and she capably performs both the comedy and the drama. I had only previously seen her in Outlaw King (where she also shined in a thankless part) and I think she's got the chops to do whatever she sets her mind to in this business. I also liked the dynamic between her and her co-star Jack Lowden who plays her brother Zack Knight. Their relationship is the linchpin of the movie and you get her brother's regret and jealousy through Jack's performance.There was a time where I was a wrestling fan (not during the period this movie takes place) so I have a casual familiarity with the sport. I think the wrestling sequences are fairly well shot, there's nothing here that's going to take your breath away but there's some well represented scenes of fundamental wrestling that don't always get the attention. I also think the movie has good cinematography throughout, they walk a line where they show the not so fun side of this lives of this family without stopping the movie dead for you to wallow in their misery. It came across as authentic without being overbearing.When I think about genres that have the most familiar plot beats or the most repeated cliches, movies about sports have to be at the top or near the top of the list. When someone subverts them (for me Rush is a good example), you really take notice and Fighting with My Family just about gets around it. Through the dialogue, the jokes and the performances, its able to dodge and weave like a crusierweight fighting the world heavyweight champ. But in the last half hour, the heavyweight finally catches it in a hold and suplexes it back into the pile of cliches. I liked Paige and the Knight family as characters but this movie got pretty cheesy at the end of it. I had to hold back a couple of groans in Paige's final moments before her first match on Raw. It didn't wreck Fighting with My Family for me but it took a little of the shine off the belt. No movie based on a true story is factual and there is always dramatic licence but even my friend who I saw this with was able to point out the non-believable parts centred around Paige's wrestling and career and even she's far from a diehard fan. So while some parts of the movie are close to the story, its obvious where the movie isn't and its too bad.I think this is a fun and relatively unique biopic that balances well enough to get the job done. It doesn't reinvent the formula but it doesn't have to. The writing is sharp, the central performance is great and Fighting with My Family achieves what it what wants to achieve. It's not aiming for awards and its not geared toward the wrestling fanatics, its made for the general audience and to bring them into this world with a loving eye and a topical story (Paige is an underdog who helps bring legitimacy to the WWE Women's Division). I'm happy to recommend this to fans of the WWE, the uninitiated and the curious and to fans of the writer and the cast. I'd give Fighting with My Family a 7.5/10, rounding up to an 8/10.",Fighting with My Family

When I first heard about the movie, I thought of it as a lazy biopic of a WWE diva with Dwayne Johnson in it. After watching the movie, it turned out as one of the best biopics of this year witb Dwayne Johnson in it. Florence Pugh did a wonderful job as Paige. Vince Vaughn is the fuel of the movie and did a good job in a supporting role. Stephen Merchant's direction need a round of applause. He didn't make a single mistake as a director can make plenty of mistakes in a biopic.

Zak's story is a lot more involving, as he struggles to settle for broken dreams.I didn't find this grabbed me emotionally in the way that Clint Eastwood's MILLION DOLLAR BABY did but it's an agreeable movie, with believable performances all round, crisply scripted and pacily directed by Stephen Merchant.

It's so unnatural and so over forced that anyone who spoke seemed liked the worst actor on the planet. 90% of the dialogue sounded like it had been written by a 13 year old. It was trying to be all hip, cool and Trainspotting but it just sounded 100% forced and 100% unnatural. Normal people don't speak like this. Then there were the actors. Man alive they were awful. 50% of it came from the awful dialogue but the main leads were also bad. Of course they looked 'nice', but to be honest, I would much rather watch ugly actors who could act then good looking people who can't. Pretty much most of the British cast in this were terrible (I'm British by the way). To sum up: This was one of the worst British films I've seen in years, and most of it is because the script and dialogue is just terrible. 3/10",Fighting with My Family
75,PyroSikTh,Dig me Dead and Bury me Pregnant,7,5 March 2019,"Fighting with My Family is less a biopic and more a family dramedy. While Paige does take centre stage, following her as she gets picked up by WWE up to her debut in Raw and her championship win, her family never gets left behind. In fact the film's strongest subplot is that of her brothers; both denied the opportunity to achieve their ultimate dreams, and lashing out as a result. It explores sibling relationships really well, building them as completely separate people, and the rivalry and jealousy that can come out of growing up together for years.The comedy is on point throughout the entire thing, whether it's Dwayne Johnson reacting in frustration when eager fans don't leave him alone, Lena Headey failing to make a good impression with her daughter-in-law's parents, and even Vince Vaughn's deadpan, otherwise completely serious drill sergeant of a coach. The jokes never outstay their welcome, they never undercut the more dramatic moments, they're never awkward or uncomfortable. In all they create a pleasant atmosphere that makes it hard not to feel good, and hard not to get attached to these characters and become invested in their triumphs and struggles.But this is where my biggest criticism comes in. In order to mimic the sports movie formula of a down-on-their-luck character beating the odds to become the best in their field, we never really see Paige succeed. She's always struggling. Her time in America is almost entirely a negative experience. She doesn't fit in. She's not strong or fit enough. She gets told off. She's lonely. But this is over half the movie. Suddenly she's at Wrestlemania, gets dragged into Dwayne Johnson's booth, and is told she's going up against the reigning champion, which we know she'll win. Her rags-to-riches tale is all rags until the final fifteen minutes when she suddenly catapults all the way to the top. This was frustrating for me as a movie fan as the narrative flow suddenly felt very rushed to get to the end, but I imagine it'd be pretty frustrating for a wrestling fan as it completely glosses over her time as NXT champion. In the movie she goes into Wrestlemania as a nobody and wins the crowd over enough to win the belt in a single ten minute fight. In reality she was already very well-known by that point (well-known and popular enough to take the title, obviously).Fighting with My Family is a very enjoyable movie to watch. It gave me joy and laughter, and her emotional pinnacle gave me chills, as by that point I was so invested in her journey. It manages all this while also weaving in a really meaningful sibling sub-plot, and the sense of family and where she's come from is never lost. It's a feelgood movie through and through, with just enough cheesiness to be effective without getting cringeworthy. It's just a shame it glossed over large portions of her climb to the top just to give us a satisfactory conclusion that just seems to burst out of nowhere. But I wouldn't blow it off just because you're not into wrestling. It's a solid movie on its own terms. I give Fighting with My Family an enjoyable 7/10.",Fighting with My Family

80,acedj,Great feel good movie,9,9 December 2019,"This movie is the semi factually incorrect story of the rise to fame of Paige, a very memorable WWE wrestler. I do not watch wrestling and even I have heard of her. The movie starts out with Paige as a child, wrestling in the family room with her brother and fast forwards to her at 18. He family runs an armature wrestling association in England as well as a school that teaches wrestling to kids. It then follows her to her try-out for the WWE and her training, culminating with her arrival to fame. I do not know what kind of person Paige really was, but in this film she is portrayed as the every person, and that makes her very likable and easy to relate with.
The Rock plays a pretty big role in her meteoric rise to fame and kudos to him if his role was not overly sensationalized for the movie. Here we have a film about an athlete in the vein of Rocky, but with more likable people. Really great job and I recommend this regardless if you watch wrestling or not.",Fighting with My Family

Zak is older brother to Saraya Knight (Florence Pugh) they love wrestling they send the wrestling ""Zak Zodiac"" help their parents train prospective wrestlers while working toward their own promotion. Rick and Julia, struggling financially, ask WWE trainer Hutch Morgan to sign the siblings. and they got a call from WWE to come over to train with them like a audition but as in training wrestling. Dwayne Johnson doesn't play character he play's himself his not much in movie but he is in it for 1 scene just to give Saraya and Zak advice, then rest of movie he doesn't appear until in middle end of movie he is poster just to be their because he is Dwayne Johnson. the day when wrestlers met their couch (Vince Vaughn) Hutch Morgan witch he is tough couch like if you got passion of something like for explame wrestlers wanna be wrestlers in WWE he would be a let down guy he will be motivated you but in another way he is letting them down. after that Saraya adopts the name Paige from her favorite character on Charmed witch Rose McaGrown played Paige, that Saraya adds her name Paige for Stage name to WWE rather then using her real name she had another names like when Saraya was 18, competing under the ring name ""Britani Knight"", Saraya and her brother ""Zak Zodiac"" help their parents train prospective wrestlers whileworking toward their own promotion. she got chosen to be WWE out of all another guys because she explained about her life story rather then explaining because i was training it since i was kid it's my passion staff like that. after she got in she was begging for Hutch to be her brother in or else she won't join in WWE training but Hutch was being treat saying or else your out that was very tough choice she had to get herself so she does. after training Paige struggles with performing promos and Morgan's constant belittlement, later on she gets stronger and more motivated. she motivated wrestlers, It's a good mix of dry and wet comedy, utilizing slapstick, with witty English humor to bring some epic laughs to the mix that aren't shoved in your face. By not focusing so much on the comedy, Merchant's work was able to tell a deeper story about the WWE legend Paige, pushing into a number of elements it's not full on drama their is but it's good mix up of combination like some of scenes are meant to be funny comedy then turns into drama witch i don't mind if this movie was like Wrestler (2009) Mickey Rourke. i never watched any of trailers at all because i wanted this to be cold turkey blind date watch of movie, i saw this in morning show news when they talk about movies. i thought this was drama film about family like if it's game plan or This Is Us short of thing but it's not it's true story about Wrestler page WWE witch i never knew about. Fans of WWE should be warned that even though the organization produced this the movie doesn't have the feel of it This is a very half British half American film. Dwayne Johnson delivers an enjoyable performance once again. The comic timing and chemistry between him and the other actors is worth watching. This movie definitely deserves more appreciation for its entertainment factor. It is funny and truly heartwarming. and also i liked women wrestlers i have loved female wrestlers it's how i got into women at age 4 i remember so on watching WWE i loved Melina. Paige is one of female wrestlers total divas i use to watch, also surprising i saw documentary at end of movie it's really good i enjoy look if your here for Paige if you love WWE if your not just fan just watch movie for interesting true story film. it's really worth of see 7.10.",Fighting with My Family

Paige (Florence Pugh) and Zak (Jack Lowden) both dream of making it to the WWE and becoming superstars at Wrestlemania to continue their family legacy. After they're both accepted to try out for the championships, what follows is a emotionally hefty drama with fantastic comic moments. Dwayne Johnson, who produces and also appears as himself, fell in love with this family and their story after watching the 2012 documentary of the same name. He offered the idea to Stephen Merchant (The Office, Cemetary Junction) to write the script. After having done a huge amount of research, Merchant very much wanted to direct as well and thank goodness he did! It's a very confident solo directorial feature debut after his great body of work with Ricky Gervais beforehand and both parties have gone on to produce amazing work of their own; this one being a massive achievement for Merchant. His likeable presence on screen and indeed behind it shines through here and keeps the family very much at the forefront. You fall in love with them very early on and I was completely invested in them, not knowing what was going to happen! The cast are fantastic; Pugh is increasingly one of the coolest young actors today and Lowden creates one of the most engaging dramatic performances of the year. Lena Headey and Nick Frost are brilliant as their parents, constantly a rock for them and conveying the family love and humour so well. Vince Vaughn very much plays himself as the WWE coach and is very funny for it with an unexpected backstory that is really well hinted at.

85,jayjaycee,Sometimes historically inaccurate but heartwarming biopic,7,4 January 2021,"""Fighting With My Family"" is a 2019 sports drama biopic directed by Stephen Merchant starring Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden.
⚪
All in all, Stephen Merchant's fictionalisation of the life of one of the most influential female wrestlers throws itself into the ropes with full use of physical strength and stages a fine brawl, as its shows the life of Saraya ""Paige"" Knight in all its honest facets, and even if it at times feels slightly formulaic and displays major historical inaccuracies, it has got an indescribably huge amount of heart, and the writer-director's versatile writing as well as Florence Pugh's powerful performance as the British superstar make for an absolutely inspiring, gripping and moving biopic that will give kids, especially young girls, someone to look up to.
⚪
All hail the May Queen! In order to celebrate the 25th birthday of one of my favourite actresses, the phenomenal Florence Pugh, I checked out the title that marked her international breakthrough in the film business, and I had a blast in two different way. On one hand, it was another opportunity for me to witness the extraordinary talent of the British actress, on the other hand it was a feast for the wrestling fan in me. It was indeed one of the rare cases where I knew the person whose life is depicted on the big screen, and I witnessed her rise to prominence as it happened. Saraya ""Paige"" Knight (in real life: Bevis) has been my favourite female wrestler ever since she stepped into the ring and won the WWE Divas Championship title. She was different, her style and her appearance distinguished from the usual formula, and my family and I loved her - especially my sisters who in fact adored her and began to look up to her wholeheartedly. Yes, Paige was indeed an instant icon, and considering her background story, it was only a matter of time that someone would adapt and turn it into movie. Fortunately, this someone was ""The Office"" mastermind Stephen Merchant who, after The Rock called attention to the extraordinary story, took on the matter and let his brilliance flow in, in both the screenplay and the directing. Altogether, he did a decent job, even though there are major historical inaccuracies and changes that were made to make it more dramatic, but aside from that, the gist stayed the same. As it is common practice with films ""based on a true story"" the truth is in fact a matter of definition, but the outline remained the same: Norwich girl Saraya Knight grew up in a family of wrestlers, her parents, Ricky and Julia Knight as well as her brother Zak Zodiac, were local celebrities, and since all of her relatives engaged in the sport, it was as if to the manner born. After years of training, she is scouted by the legendary World Wrestling Federation and passed the try-out, so that she is indeed signed by the company later on. However, as easy as it at first sounds, it was a rocky road that bore a lot of problems. Merchant knows to approach this matter with his usual cleverness and always find the perfect balance between funny, serious and dramatic, and all of it is sufficiently elaborated and developed with enough sensitivity and, most importantly, respect. The film doesn't shy away to depict her origin in all its facets, and if I say all, I mean all. From the criminal records of her family, over the wrestling school they run to the harassment they are exposed to, you see all of it at least once. They are weird people, as she says herself, but weird people with dreams and desires - and they film depicts them as such. Saraya and her brother Zak have always dreamed about joining the WWE and one of the main issues the film focusses on is the difference between the two. While his sister got the chance to become a superstar, Zak struggles dealing with his rejection and living a life outside from wrestling. Like with everything else, this movie shows the conflicts it depicts in regards of the whole family. Yes, it is about Paige in the first place, but her family is a part of her, and this premise is reflected in the writing as well. In Florida, the pale, gothlike British struggles to fit in the group of tanned, blonde models and begins to lose her motivation. Furthermore, her physical conditions are not as ideal as previously thought, and for a long time she thinks about giving up - after trying to change who she really is. However, after a cathartic conversation with her brother, she makes tracks and succeeds in everything she had previously problems with. She begins to accept herself, befriend her colleagues and continue to fight for what she has always dreamed of - in the end, it all pays of, as she gets a shot at the title and, as fans know, wins in a spontaneous match against AJ Lee, thus making her the youngest ""Divas Championess"" of all time at 21. The thing is, even if the film ends at that point, she has done even more after that. Thanks to her, the female wrestling that has previously been more of a gimmick, has become a serious thing, as she was just tremendously popular: as part of the Women's Evoltuion, more female matches were scheduled, the storylines were more fleshed out and in general, they are more respected, as seen by the example that they have discontinued the term ""Diva"" and are nowadays referred to as ""Women Superstars"" or simply ""Superstars"". This film is a story of dedication, passion, pursuing one's dreams and never giving up. Even if many (some actually important) details have been altered in order to make them look dramatic (Paige was in real life respected for her origin, was already NXT Championess, and never suffered from self-confidence issues or stage fright), it is still a brutally honest and most of all inspiring biopic. Without a doubt a perfectly balanced, atmospheric yet undeniably predictable feel good movie that works out surprisingly well. The choreographies are always on point, the tone remains fitting to each sequence, and most importantly, the actors and actresses deliver excellently. Since I knew the woman she portrays, I can say that Pugh's performance as Paige is outstandingly authentic and played passionately. Paige is already a legend, and many girls around the globe look up to her (as mentioned before, my sisters as well) and seeing this film made me love her even more and even non wrestling fans will find this to be an inspirational underdog story. Heart-warming cinema, indeed!",Fighting with My Family
86,thebricks,"Mediocre, poorly written script",5,23 February 2019,"In my last few days of A-List and going to see Fighting With My Family. Looked interesting, but it's easy to tell so much of this movie was not telling the real story. Would a future WWE wrestler really go through tryouts and then some sort of Navy SEAL training program to make it? Paige is shown having trouble on exercise courses in spite of the fact that she's supposed to have been the only one of the women to have actually trained in wrestling, going up against men much bigger her entire life. You mean to say that she could flip men over and over but all of a sudden, a big tire is too much for her? Meanwhile, the model and cheerleader do it like it's a piece of cake? What? Why wouldn't they have picked her brother? He was perfect, had an attitude, could fight, he 's everything WWE wanted while Paige simply wasn't, at least in the movie. Paige had no stage presence, she either froze or was totally lacking in personality and conviction. Why would WWE have been impressed by her first appearance? It's a show, she froze up, I would say she was absolutely terrible. Also, the brother was a good fighter in the film, but acts like his life is over after he's not picked for WWE. Why not do UFC or box? He clearly wasn't that good in real life.Florence Pugh is a very good actress and did a good job with this film. She was the film's saving grace. Overall, the cast was great, the direction was great, the story just was terrible. It needed work. It's a good family movie for a night out.I will add, the depiction of England is spot on. It gave me PTSD. I went there no vacation and my hostel was south of the Thames in a poor, working class area. The people there are very rough, not posh like you see on TV shows or the usual stereotypical British show. Everything about their mannerisms, attitude is just spot on, right down to the dog. People there are not afraid to pick a fight, they drink all the time. It's a huge culture shock if you're from America, I will say that for sure. I've been to many former English colonies, even Australia, and it's not that crazy. England is just a dump, right down to the perpetually dark sky. If you're considering spending a lot of money to go to England on vacation, or gulp, LIVE, I'd watch this first.",Fighting with My Family
87,jackmeat,Funny but so many issues,6,25 March 2019,"My quick rating - 5,6/10. Ok I have a lot of problems with this movie. First off, why wasn't it Paige in it? Second, if you use actors instead, why was the Rock in it. Now the story is about her life, and yes, she was raised in a wrestling family. This shows her road actually into her fame and her downfall. But it never really pulled you in unless you really understand how that world worked. It needed to explain far better what she had to go through. Her opponents in the movie were also bogus so that did not help. I can't say anything about her brother, would be spoiler, but the focus on that also was distracting. It does have some very nice performances by those in the movie. I would say if you are a fan of hers, or even WWE you will get something out of it, but if you care less about sports entertainment, you'll get nothing.",Fighting with My Family

89,ritera1,"""A true story"" it is not. Wrestling fans will be disappointed.",7,16 February 2019,"Now there are good reasons to make a film like this when considering the demographic. Has a strong young female protagonist; a rags-to-riches story. I can see where teen girls would like this and find inspiration in such. And WWE is seeing increased interest from female viewers. But they must not be familiar with the mechanics of wrestling to fully buy this film.The initial presentation of the Knight family rang true, authentic and affable. Putting it in their actual home was a good idea. Frost and Headley were great in the roles as Paige's parents and Puge did a very good job as Paige. Lowden as her brother made a good mentor but it tried to take the high road and make Paige an angelic character.Her tryout had that great moment where she basically said this was her only avenue and impressed that she was up to the challenge. (In reality, she was rejected in her first attempt and was taken in her second.)But once it crossed over to Paige going alone to the US to train, it quickly devolved into inauthentic melodrama. Just as a drama, I didn't appreciate that we're introduced to this strong young woman who then collapses at every avenue because she's lonely and out-of-place. There was mention in the documentary of her loneliness but there was no debate about her staying put, unlike the fictional aspect in the film.I found two elements interesting, too, as it was partially produced by the WWE.The film features three women recruited to wrestle who'd never wrestled before. Found that odd as it was very self-critical when they do have many women who're authentic and good wrestlers with substantial training. Yes, it's true that they have the T&A element there, but still didn't see how those three characters earned their ""bones."" They should not have been there.Then there was the muddled WWE mythos of the wrestler as entertainer whose main job is to bring the best match they can. Assume that they were trying to forward the ""passion"" for this, but didn't think that was the best vehicle. Not the movie they were making. I do think there's a wrestling movie that's more exploratory. ""The Wrestler"" a few years ago was extremely good and dark, but did cover all bases of such. The Vince Vaughn character tried to put some ""bitterness"" into that mix, but was too little.Briefly within was the pain of the other brother in realizing that he'll never achieve his dream and make the big time, like his sister. But, as per the companion documentary this was based on, it shows that the reality was he took it in stride. The element of him with a new baby was total fiction vs. the documentary that took place at the same time as this dramatized film.(And in the film there was a cursory back story about the 2nd older brother, which was complete fiction, as per the documentary.)Depicted in a few short months (which was actually 3 years in real life), she forms a bond with the three other women and finds a way to go forward towards her goal. They establish that she had a pending task of improving her mic/interview skills, which was never resolved, even into the ending. Not true in real life as Paige is very good on the mic, an essential for any wrestler. The three years she was in the ""minor league"" would have resolved any of that.Throughout the film, we're clearly and repeatedly reminded that pro-wrestling is predetermined. That's true. It wasn't shown but matches are usually worked out between the two wrestlers. The outcome is known.Which made the ending very manufactured and false. Yes, Paige did win the title that night but was depicted as if the outcome was in doubt. Like she actually won it in a real wrestling match. Absolutely not. She would have known she was going to win the title (another YouTube source with her stated she knew an hour before, if true) and her and AJ Lee would have had a discussion about such. (The ""out of nowhere"" wrestler winning the title has been done before. It's called a ""push"" on that person's wrestling character.)In reality, she was a champion in her time in NXT and would have not been brought to the main roster unless she was fully capable and not hesitant. In the film, she was shown to be very hesitant and the actual exchange with AJ Lee was not accurate and can be found on YouTube.Now there is a very difficult road to hoe when it comes to the actual Paige. Granted, I do think she's a good role model for young girls and was a very good wrestler. Her achievements were impressive.But any wrestling fan has known her subsequent troubles with drugs, erratic behavior, several relationships and even a sex tape. As a wrestling fan, knowing that made watching this fictional angelic Paige hard to accept.(She had even been to the US previously as she wrestled there before, as she had also wrestled all over Europe.)So, if you're a wrestling fan and know the business, this will let you down. Worth a look, just because there are no wrestling movies.What it did suffer from was that there really was no middle act. In reality, Paige worked for three years in NXT and continued to gain experience and credibility. That's great and all but film relies on the three-act structure. Being that it wasn't there, they had to manufacture the difficulties and it didn't work.Always good to see The Rock be The Rock, as the two scenes with him were enjoyable and funny. But I assume he was an uncredited writer and director, because an amateurish quality came through in such.",Fighting with My Family
90,mike-c-b,The story is about a tough girl that loses her soul.,1,2 May 2020,"Written by Stephen Merchant to be a WWE punchy comedy but actually turns into a story about a tough, smart girl who fails to stand up for herself properly.First of all Vince Vaughn plays a ""do what I say"" army style coach whose main goal is to beat character out of his trainees, even though WWE is ABOUT CHARACTER. He performs a fake, cold look and yells.Second, every opportunity is taken to betray the main character until she hits rock bottom, then walk it off and now all of a sudden life is golden. In truth, a really tough person stands up for themselves properly.This is the style of movie written by Merchant who doesn't know about stength of character or WWE or anything watchable. ""Lets see someone fail to stand up for themselves, then we'll play rock music and lifes good after that"". Total joke.",Fighting with My Family
91,WalkdenEntertainment,We All Fight With Our Family...,9,19 April 2019,"Our film focuses on a family where the entire crew (Dad, Mum, Son & Daughter) are extremely passionate about wrestling. During their day to day life all family members work together to put on wrestling shows around London, England. Soon it is announced that both the brother and sister of the family have been invited for try-outs to potentially become the next WWE superstar. As one of them passes the 1st stage, the other is told to go home, meaning one other member of the family begins their journey of achieving big dreams and the desires of a lifetime while the other faces failure.This is based on a true story about a family who love to fight.To get straight into it, this is a fun, feel good film with no nudity or horrible foul language (ok- maybe a little crude talk, but still). Our film actually covers many heartfelt messages about family, passion, failure, confidence, going for your dream, never giving up, and I honestly could go on. I also found this film's end message to be extremely positive, even to the point where it got to me personally after leaving the theatre (in a good way).The family is extremely hilarious to watch which is mostly thanks to actor Nick Frost who plays the Family's Father and is an Ex wrestler and ex con. The family's dialogue is extremely believable and is well written with quick and heartfelt scripting.You might notice Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) is located on the film's poster. While he plays himself in this film, many fans might be surprised to find he only appeared in this film a couple of times. Despite this, whenever he appears on screen he is fantastic as he bumps into the young teenagers who are trying to be the next champion like him. Funny man actor Vince Vaughan also makes a great appearance in this film and he too surprised me here with his character (no spoilers).Overall, I feel this is a film that deserves more acknowledgement than it has received as it has gone somewhat under the reader. There's lots of praise to give this film as a story, but I also found there are lots of laughs to share. See it with a friend or your family (even if they drive you crazy) and be encouraged.8.9/10

92,movieman6-413-929510,Entertaining and informative film about the tough wrestling world.,6,1 April 2019,"Fighting with My Family is a new adaptation of a biography. The film is directed, written and partly produced by Stephen Merchant, the director of Cemetery Junction.The film is about the biography of female WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment) wrestler Saraya-Jade Bevis Knight. She struggled under the ring name Paige. Saraya Knight is played in the film by Florence Pugh.
Saraya Knight comes from a British family of real wrestling fans. Saraya and her brother Zak (Jack Lowden) get the chance to audition for WWE. In this way they try to be accepted by the WWE to make their dreams come true and thus make their family proud. After the audition, however, only Saraya is chosen to be part of the tough training program. Saraya must therefore leave her friends and family behind to go through the training with her own hands. So she has to discover what makes her special compared to the other candidates, in order to break through as a real wrestling star.To understand this film, you don't need to know anything about WWE or other struggling, because you get the necessary information further from the film. For people who are known or just a fan of wrestling, this film is extra entertaining. This film can also come across as familiar if you are familiar with other sports biography films, because the film has the same kind of story.
What makes this film special is the family aspect of the film, because both Saraya and Zak try to make their parents proud by making it in the wrestling world. Because of Saraya's greater success, her parents seem to be more proud of her, which puts Zak in a depressed time.
The title of the film also responds well to the protagonist's problems, because in order to make her own success she sometimes has to go against the rules of her parents when it comes to wrestling. She also goes against the rules and traditions of her wrestling family, because Saraya, for example, does not want to dress in such short, tight and glittering wrestling clothes during her wrestling competitions.Apart from the family problems and drama, the film is written pretty funny. Nick Frost, who plays Saraya her father, has many comic moments in the film where he comments on certain things or events. Vince Vaughn plays Saraya her wrestling trainer and he also has comic moments with texts in which he insults her in comical ways. This role is very similar to his role in the Hacksaw Ridge war drama where he played an army sergeant, who also insulted the new soldiers in hard, comical ways.The acting is done well in the film. Florence Pugh comes across as a rebellious girl who dreams of breaking into the wrestling world. Together with the rest of the cast that her further family plays in the film, they appear realistic as a true British family. Some of the cast are more cast for the film because of their appearance, because they play female wrestlers, which should look nice to the male wrestling audience. Many of them have not really played in other films besides this film.
Real wrestling matches are also more meant as entertainment matches, where if you pay attention you can see that most of them are not real and more are being played. You can also see this with this film. For example, fake moments during the fights in the film are not that disturbing, because this is also the case with real wrestling matches. Because the fights in the film can be seen a bit slower, you can clearly see that the fights are fake. Some real (ex) wrestlers such as Dwayne Johnson and John Cena also have a cameo in this film. This wrestler now also plays more in films. Due to its popularity, Dwayne Johnson is also widely used to promote this film.",Fighting with My Family

But to do it like that he had to pay a big price in authenticity, and, as most of wrestling, this story is more a fairy tale than reality, and as such, instead of a real life story I always had the feeling I was just watching a movie.

110,RhapsodyReviews,Has Me in Stitches.,9,5 November 2019,"Review:
'Fighting with My Family' is a biographical-comedy-drama film directed by Stephen Merchant. It is based on the documentary by Max Fisher, it depicts the WWE career of professional wrestler Paige.
This is a heart-warming family drama that was very funny in places and had me in stitches several times. I watched this with my wife who is not a wrestling fan, but she really loved it too!
Born into a tight-knit wrestling family, Paige (Florence Pugh) and her brother Zak (Jack Lowden) are ecstatic when they get the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try out for the WWE. But when only Paige earns a spot in the competitive training program, she must leave her loved ones behind and face this new cutthroat world alone. Paige's journey pushes her to dig deep and ultimately prove to the world that what makes her different is the very thing that can make her a star.
This was a carefully crafted movie with a tight script brilliantly acted by the entire ensemble. The two main leads Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden demonstrated an emotional intensity well beyond their years, we felt their pain and anguish and their joy and triumph.
This movie did not descend into sentimental mush or become so British that it alienated its audience with puns and irony, because believe me they were present. This movie was great because it went well beyond what the audience saw, it had a massive psychological backdrop, it had something to say about, dreams, family, teamwork, sacrifice, loneliness, redemption, and even the value of tough love.
Overall, this movie is great if you've ever seen an underdog sports movie based on a true story and enjoyed it, you'll most likely enjoy the hell out of this. If you've never seen such a movie, this is the perfect opportunity to crawl out from under your rock and give this one a shot.

The story is as predictable as they come, and there's just too much Council Estate about it (I've nothing against Council Estates, they just don't make for fun films).I'm giving it 6 stars rather than 5 because the film has a good heart and no Bad Guys.

116,nims-1975,"It's in between good and very good, it lacked things in so many ways, they should have used John Cena a bit more and there was far too much focus on The Rock",7,2 August 2019,"Fighting With My Family is a film which I enjoyed watching, found entertaining to watch and was funny as well as having some great acting by some great actors. Florence Pugh who acted as Saraya Knight did some not excellent but very good acting as Paige. When she struggled to cope with other women in America going for the WWE who were Models and Cheerleaders and who were sexy and had blonde hair. At times she misunderstood them trying to cause problems but when she died her hair blonde, she looked awful and looked like she had melted cheese on her haid and the blonde hair look didn't suit her. Luckily she changed her hair back to her original Black hair and she looked a lot better. Big Show and Sheamus were in this film had a very small part where you would see them talking to each other with Paige around them. John Cena was supposed to be in this film, you saw him enter the WWE Arena and then it went to the TV Screen where people were watching WWE and you didn't hear him say anything. That's another film that this film lacked John Cena is a 16 Time WWE World Champion Wrestler and The Rock is a 10 Time WWE World Champion American Wrestler and they should have given Cena the chance to be in this film a bit more and say something in this film but they didn't and I am very disappointed and frustrated with that. I don't hate or dislike this film and I won't get rid of this film that I have on DVD but this film lacked a lot of things in many ways. The actress who played AJ Lee was useless and didn't look nothing like AJ Lee. The acting in Fighting With My Family by Dwayne Johnson, Nick Frost, Lena Headey, Florence Pugh, Jack Lowden and Vince Vaughn was very good.",Fighting with My Family

It tells a tale of a sister and a brother who want to attend at the biggest wrestling show in the USA. So they apply, but only the sister was accepted. Now their both way changed and this is the storry about. The storry about family ties, friendship, competition, in short words ... blood sweat and tears. It is a real life story with a nearly perfect cast. The actors nearly look like the real persons - they've put in images of them in the outro.

When one makes but the other doesn't there are some problems and she doesn't think she can make the WWE.Fighting With My Family is a funny film about wrestling. That said it was still serious. I thought the wrestling scenes were pretty basic though. It was like a back and forth the whole time. Also the crowd just turns easily. Things I liked though. It was pretty funny. I enjoyed the bits of comedy every once in a while. The training scenes also were pretty cool to watch. There was also a fight scene in a bar that looked pretty good. They had to do some intense stuff and they also had to use CGI. That scene was pretty hard to do. Also the acting was great. Vince Vaugh did a fantastic job in this movie. He was funny and also a serious trainer.Overall Fighting With My Family was a fun movie to watch.,Fighting with My Family

125,torrascotia,Decent family film about decent people.,6,28 February 2019,"This is a very British working class comedy which centres around a wrestling mad family and their dreams of stardom. Its based on a true story and roughly around a documentary of the family made recently. At the helm is one of the writers of The Office, the superior UK version not the US remake. Also on board are a few American actors and Nick Frost from Spaced.
The tone of the movie is something like the commitments or Full Monty, you may need to be British to get some of the humour. Fortunately not all movies are made with the states in mind.
It is very funny however some of the language and scenes of violence may not make it suitable for smaller kids.
Also I have no interest or knowledge of wrestling but that didnt detract from the enjoyment of the movie.
This is not a mega-bucks The Rock vehicle, its a low key small budget UK flick with no real surprises but a few laughs along the way.
Its quite enjoyable.
Also the last thing, the reviewer know as ""thebricks"" used the final section of his review to call the UK a dump and suggest the people here just drink and fight which is highly offensive to us in the UK.
The fact that despite it being flagged twice for being offensive and off topic shows the mods do not seem to care about xenophobia. That being the case then I reckon the US is a dump full of obese low IQ xenophobes who don't understand anything outside of their own trailer park. This movie is not for them.",Fighting with My Family

It was little difficult for me to accept Florence Pugh as Paige appearance wise but when it comes to acting she has nailed each and every segment whether is the emotional part or In-Ring performance her hard work was clearly visible.

Saraya and Zak compete for the same WWE and coach Hutch (acted well by Vince Vaughn ends up choosing only Saraya whose new name is Paige. Paige has to leave England and home alone and go to Florida to compete with other wrestlers. Most notable competitors are 3 pretty American blondes. Paige feels very out of place but manages to shine with help of love , strength, faith in her from her family. Brother Zak , initially envious of his sister's success, gets over his insecurities . Paige has a great relationship with her brother and forces him to enjoy his girlfriend and their cute little newborn. Zak realizes his strengths and respects Paige's strengths. With the whole family backing her, Paige is victorious. Even though i do not watch wrestling /WWE this movie was very pleasant and likeable. Knight family put aside their unsophisticated ways when they have to meet Zak's girlfriend's sophisticated parents. The scenes are done well and Dwayne Johnson ""The Rock"" is very pleasant . Paige learned to wrestle while fighting with family. Paige is very level headed and actress Florence Pugh was very convincing as Paige. Jack Lowden as Zak was very convincing in showing his emotions of hurt and then great at turning his jealousy into tolerance and acceptance. The whole cast did a great job. It was nice to see actress Kim Matula as 1 of the 3 blondes ( Hope from my favorite soap Bold & Beautiful) on the big screen. Very enjoyable movie with a take home message.",Fighting with My Family

135,domtaylor,"We've seen it all before, but Merchant manages to make it feel fresh.",7,22 March 2019,"'Fighting With My Family' is the best kind of sports film, one that will not only appeal to fans of the sport (in this case wrestling) but everybody, regardless of if they even know what the sport is. While there is a lot here for wrestling fans (the behind the scenes look at the wrestlers' journey to fame and the recreated ring sequences should suffice), Merchant ensures to keep a keen focus on the 'family' aspect of things, meaning that Paige's story will be relatable to anyone. It's the same 'underdog' story that we've seen time and time again in pictures of this ilk, so it is all very predictable. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing as the formula always works, here being no exception. With a great cast (Pugh and Lowden surprisingly being the standouts), a good balance of humour and drama, and an engaging script, Merchant manages to deliver the traditional formula with a real knockout, pushing the cliches against the ropes and winning over the crowd. It's not flawless, however, as its third act feels extremely rushed, which lessens its impact and makes it feel incomplete. It's not a huge detriment though as it does its job and wraps up the story in a satisfying way, without lessening the enjoyment that the picture brings as a whole. 7/10",Fighting with My Family

It's was enjoyable and engrossing in your typical ""sportsing nobody triumphs over adversity"" way. I think I was let down somewhat because her story really is compelling, but the movie is toothless. It had all the pieces for a Rocky but instead tried to be a limp-wristed waterboy. The jokes never grow beyond a chuckle and the really bad stuff is presented in the most inoffensive matter possible. Edgar Wright's buddies are in this for some reason, but those guys are more suited to over the top comedy and are just filling space here. Stephen Merchant shows up to do his fish out of water nerd routine but hes plays the straight man, like come on give him something to do!I think the goal was to make a inspirational movie about Paige, but it was held in a headlock by needing to be little girl demographic appropriate.

150,shimenpf,Way better than I expected,7,18 August 2019,"Given the nature of the movie, and even though it was based on a real story, I wasn't expecting much. Even with WWE directly involved in the project, I figured this would be a low budget movie that would come and go, forgotten. I can gladly say I was mistaken. This is a great story about chasing dreams, family and the sacrifices one must make. The conflict is constant, as Paige faces dilemmas of whether she can or not go on with this. Her non-fitting nature is inspiring and, at some points, tear-dropping. The brother's subplot is great, as it shows us the frustration that eventually leads to the last push Paige needs near the climax. I found myself so involved in the story and the characters, that I actually was very nervous when Paige was in the locker room and Vince Vaughn knocks on the door and tells her it's time for the fight before the climax. The resolution of the story is very emotive, and I had to fight tears back. And speaking of Vince Vaughn, I loved the character. The mentor that acts works as an antagonist for moments only to push the characters to give their 110%. His moments of understanding and tenderness, like a father figure to Paige, add a lot to both characters.
On the negative side, I found some moments to be cringeworthy, like when brother and sister jog up the mountain to the bench. That might be just me, but I felt uncomfortable. Also, the pace gets a little slow past the bar fight scene for a few minutes, but it's not that big of a deal. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie, way more than I had expected. It's a beautiful, deep journey that definitely delivers.",Fighting with My Family
151,ryanwinning1,Heartfelt story. Life lessons about communication,7,11 June 2019,"The story that WWE is trying to paint here is that, these wrestlers break there backs, struggle and put themselves through hell for 99% of their lives just so that in those 2-3 hours of show every Sunday, Monday, Friday it is explosive, hilarious and worth-while entertainment!! Anyone who has set foot in a WWE ring has had to make some major sacrifices and decisions to cut out things in their life in order to make their dream a reality. Every person in this movie gets a rude awakening at some point because things don't go exactly the way they had imagined it in their mind. What really makes this movie interesting is that it seems like all the characters in this movie do a really poor job of communicating exactly what it is that they want, so they're really just guessing their way through every scenario based off of a combination of what they want and what they think the person they are taking action for wants!! Eventually it catches up to the main character Paige when she gets caught in a moment where things aren't working out and she thinks everyone is out to get here, when in reality she actually isn't being as co-operative and kind to the people in her life either. The ahhh-ha moment is when Paige gets egg in her face because she assumed the girls were talking and snickering behind her back when they were actually just worried about one of their daughters who they haven't seen in a long long time. Paige realizes all of her frustrations could have been alleviated if she just asked some of the people she's been working with a little bit about them, and I think many many people who are unhappy with where they are in North American culture, live their lives in a similar way!

I knew a little bit about Paige's (Saraya Jade Bevis) back story from watching WWE programming and reading up on her history but was still surprised by many parts eg. parents backstory. I knew that she came from a family of wrestlers but I didn't know how much the Rock influenced her career or even the phone call. I can't imagine a more cool moment for her family and for her.

160,MattyRich92,A real slobberknocker,7,20 May 2019,"By far the best WWE feature film I've seen. An underdog story that has humor and sincerity. The family dynamic is vulgar and charming.

I am a big fan of a few of Dwayne's films, but Gosh.... when I watched this film, the sentiment and vibes I was getting from this film, made me want to throw up. The film was rubbing me the wrong way... ya know. it was like this film had too much trashy people's sentiment, and sexual predator and registered sexual offender vibes to it.Definitely. not worth watching for someone who cares about a sense of personal decency. Especially if you want to make it as someone as a reputable professional. Not a good look to have underneath your belt. literally. circulating that look...

I thought the acting was really good from everyone else aswell, especially Nick Frost and Lena Headey who were very funny.
I haven't watched WWE for many years now because all of my favourite wrestlers have gone, like Triple H and Stone Cold Steve Austin but this film made me want to watch it again, then I find out Paige has retired so I guess not.
Anyway I really enjoyed this feel good film, it was really entertaining.",Fighting with My Family

Try to annoy them to the point of your own justifiable death.As always, Florence Pugh was terrific. Other cast members were great too. The Rock stopped by for a brief moment.

170,Lost_In_Translation_,"A heartwarming and fun tale, even if you're not a WWE fan",8,2 March 2019,"I've been a passive fan of WWE for a while now. I don't watch all of it and what I do watch is sparse. During NXT's transformation from FCW and it's availability on the WWE Network, I was at my peak interest in watching it. NXT was better than any of the main RAW or Smackdown shows 100%. I was into how much fun NXT felt. CM Punk was the only main roster person I was really into, Daniel Bryan was fun to watch too . AJ Lee was great, but her competition was weak and seemed like they were all the ""models, cheerleaders, and dancers"" that Paige jokes about in this movie. But it wasn't until Paige came into the spotlight that my interest was peaked. I was into it for a while, then just lost interest all together.I saw this movie as I knew about Paige and was into the WWE during the time all this happened and even as a passive fan, this movie was extremely heartwarming and fun to watch. I knew a decent amount of the WWE side of things going on in the movie, but you don't need to be a fan of wrestling at all. It's just a fantastically done story about a family who has a passion for the entertainment sport like no other, and about their daughter having to leave to pursue a bigger version of their passion. Her brother struggles with not being chosen and coming to terms he won't make it as big as she does.Some of the facts are fudged here and there, but that happens in every bio-pic. Paige's NXT time seems to be glossed over a lot as she was in it for a while and in no way an ""unknown"" to wrestling fans. Also AJ Lee isn't given enough credit for what she did for women's wrestling, and the ending kind of makes it seem like Paige was the ONLY factor in legitimizing women's wresting in the WWE. But seeing how CM Punk, AJ, and WWE all fell out a few years back, it is understandable that they gloss over her impact on women's wrestling as this movie is a WWE product. Even then it is still a fantastically directed and made movie despite the WWE producing it.It's just an all around fun and heartwarming look into the world of wrestling. Even if you think wrestling is dumb, or childish, please just drop all those pre-conceived notions and see this movie and see how passionate some people are about this art form!",Fighting with My Family

A tragic story, but what struck me the most and i think it's the best is the plot of his brother, who stayed on the other side of the pond because he was not accepted to fight, the story of how he deals with the frustration of not being able to follow his dreams and have to gave himself to the world to contribute their bit as a mentor and support new people who want to move forward.",Fighting with My Family

Paige was a good wrestler, but her life story wasn't something I had any interest in. However, even if a lot of stuff might of been ""enhanced,"" the movie doesn't fail to be entertaining. There's a surprisingly good amount of sharp wit and one-liners without being too screwball and keeping the drama intact. All the cast is great, especially Vince Vaughn as the coach who has to dash the recruits' dreams.But I thought it glossed over too much of what made her special enough to rise in the first place. Sure she had the talent, but if you want to know how she made jump to champion then you're going to be disappointed. So they could've expanded a bit more on that.Overall, it was a fun time and I can give a hearty recommendation even if you don't care for wrestling.",Fighting with My Family
183,carlo_simone18,I wish I enjoyed this more than I did,6,20 February 2019,"Having been a big fan of Stephen Merchant's work before I was sort of underwhelmed by this. Whilst he demonstrates that he's a competent director I felt that the writing was a little formulaic, especially with the humour which felt a little obvious most of the time. Nonetheless they are still some decent jokes in here, especially helped by Nick Frost's delivery.Whilst Paige's story is fairly formulaic and simple, the aspect of the plot involving her brother Zak and how he coped with not being picked for the WWE training programme was really well-written. It added a genuinely intriguing element to the narrative and helped to raise my score for the film.Aside from that the acting from everyone was pretty great, especially from Florence Pugh and Jack Lowden, whilst Dwayne Johnson was entertaining in the couple of scenes that he is in.Whilst not really appealing to me, I'm glad people are enjoying it and I hope Merchant will be able to do more directing in the future.",Fighting with My Family
184,TheConnoisseurReviews,It has no Right Being this Good,9,11 March 2019,"""Fighting with My Family"" has no right being as good as it is. By the trailers it looked like a direct to video WWE produced vehicle that they wanted to get quick buck with The Rock bankability. However, it's a movie with a lot of charm, humor, and most importantly heart. The film itself is very British in terms of it's jokes, but that adds to the likability of the characters and the timing and nature of the jokes. The film feels like an indie movie and that's a good thing because it adds to the grit of becoming a professional wrestler and Paige as a person and character. And this film quite honestly isn't just for wrestling fans, it's for anyone that likes movies about the underdog and a family that is bounded by a similar passion. Yes, it does have insider terms and jokes, but the film does a great job of explaining it for the general audience, while also showing them why people are such huge fans of wrestling and the amount of hard work and dedication that goes into the sport. It is a great movie that anyone can enjoy and have a great time with, but there are a few things that will make wrestling fans enjoy it just a little bit more. Go check it out, if you haven't, I give it 4.5/5",Fighting with My Family
185,gbidari,All around above average,8,23 May 2019,"Actually a very good, sometimes touching tear jerking drama. Performances are great. Well shot and production design fits. Merchant helms this well, but I wish there were more laughs- though when they come they are big. Vaughn is subdued and wish his part was more lively. Also the drama with the main character is all internal and self created by the main character so it's kind of hard to really get fully behind this as a struggle when there are so many other important stories and suffering, even in this film. Not saying it's easy to make it, just that this film isn't really about the struggle of making it wrestling. More than anything it's about family and finding oneself in the face of the chaos of the world. Honestly the B plots are just as strong and maybe more beautiful than the main story.",Fighting with My Family

The way he got mad for failing but at the same time kept supporting his sister and even made us see how he is really her unique source of comfort and support before the final scene...Paige stepping out again and winning it all was the highlight of the movie.

Stephen Merchant brings to life this Norfolk wrestling family with such heart and soul even the strongest of muscle bound mat slammers would need a hankie-chef. With wrestling in their blood and all they know, quitting is simply not an option. The humour is right on key with Nick Frost as the outrageous but brilliant father of Saraya and Zak. Florence Pugh is Saraya and Jack Lowden is Zak both born into a life of wrestling in Norwich fun fares and arcades and crossing their fingers on one day being selected into the WWE. Both play very real characters with many layers sometimes second guessing themselves with the situations and cards they are dealt. Whether you like wrestling or not this is not really so much a story about wrestling. More a story about a very unique eccentric family whom appear to be very hard up and use wrestling as an escape route. Beautiful acted by both brother and sister and many of the supporting cast this is a thoroughly enjoyable watch. The contrast of an outside family meeting this wrestling family has plenty of laughs and feels real. What is the WWE? Well you are about to find out Vince Vaughn style!! Even dodge fans won't wanna dodge this one!! Will you take a trash can to the face? Well it beats the spanner!!",Fighting with My Family
194,jditch,Another amazing Florence Pugh performance.,8,1 March 2019,"I wasn't sure whether I was going to like the film. I'm not really a WWE fan, at least not since I was 12. I was also worried it would be pointless comedy. But the film was way better than I expected it to be.Florence Pugh is amazing as usual. She's one of the best young actresses in film right now. She nails her role, always completely believable. Lena Headey and Nick Frost are so good that it's hilarious when you see real footage in the credits.
Jack Lowden really shows off his talent too.The characters were complex too. At first, you'll be deceived by characters that appear shallow. But the writing is so strong that there's some great character development. You'll really find yourself questioning your preconceptions by the time the credits roll.Lovely film",Fighting with My Family

This movie is a Hollywood cookie cutter non offensive movie that is designed for laughs in certain places, tears in others, followed by a few cheers. I'm not that type of movie goer. I like obscure, odd, a little challenging. I like Stephen merchant, he has worked on some personal faves including obviously the office. I love nick frost having been in spaced, paul, shaun of the dead, etc. So I thought this would have a little edge, but sadly did not. Its watchable, and many middle of the pack fans will like it. I just think it's ok (a 6) not good (7+).

198,LordOfTheThundercats,FINALLY WWE DO SOMETHING RIGHT,10,6 March 2019,I've followed Saraya Jade Bevis since she first appeared on the channel 4 documentary The Wrestlers: Fighting With My Family (2012). This girl changed the landscape of female professional wrestling. Being a huge fan of WWF/E for 38 years and a huge fan of movies for just as long this is what's been lacking.

Good old fashioned British humour mixed in with Paige's desire, and the up's and down's of her getting to the WWE. It's very funny, but with little sad bits, and a brilliant cast. Nick Frost is on top form, especially when The Rock telephones him and he doesn't believe it is the Rock.

But, this movie is great. Paige and her family are full, detailed characters. You can relate from the onset. Sure, the story is a bit corny and many details and events are glossed over, but it's a story about family and the dream of being a professional wrestler. It fits perfectly with the subject matter. Like wrestling, we don't need all the deep details. You just tell a great story and get the audience to feel something. Which is what this movie does. Is it the next Best Picture Oscar winner? No. But it truly is a glorious tale of the importance of family and never giving up on your dreams.",Fighting with My Family

206,brent-27849,Good movie,8,18 March 2021,"I didn't know who Paige was before watching this movie. I mean, I used to watch wrestling, back in the eighties, maybe early nineties, Hulk Hogan, Ultimate Warrior, Davey Boy Smith and the Dynamite Kid, but about the only wrestler I know about anymore, who isn't even a wrestler anymore, is the Rock. But then this movie is less about wrestling than it is about family. It's funny and heartfelt and I was completely in Paige's corner from the get go.The interesting thins is that Paige actually seems ok with who she is in the beginning. It's a bunch of other people who think she should be something else, like those two nasties who look at her like she just crawled out from under a rock. Paige holds her own, yet like anyone, she begins to have doubts about herself, going so far as to try and change her hair color and personality to try and fit in. In the end though, she learns what the Rock tells her to be, the first her, just an outside oddball from Norwich England with wrestling in her blood, like hepatitis (joke from the movie).Equally important is Zak's storyline, because for every Paige in the world who makes her wildest dreams come true, there are ten thousand like Zak, who don't. Whether they learn it early or late, what they learn is that it doesn't mean life is over, they just need to learn to appreciate all the good things they do have. After all, if nothing falls out while wearing dad's shorts in front of a crowd who all laugh at, the situation, really, how can anyone say life is all that bad.",Fighting with My Family

I liked wrestling when I was 6-8 and then I grew up and realized it was totally fake and staged.I always thought if people want to watch fighting why not watch the UFC they have tons of intellectually challenged muscle monkeys that actually do beat the snot out of each other. I tried to watch UFC but once you've seen a couple rock heads pound each other up it becomes stale quite quickly. I compare the adult males that watch WWE to the adult females that watch soap operas as the acting in both is equivocally cheesy and terrible. Some reviewers claim there are many other wrestlers that have better stories to that I say there are way better actual people that have contributed to this existence they could make a movie about before a wrestler ever deserves a bio movie. Merchant directing and writing this garbage was a huge surprise as I thought more of him than this tripe.",Fighting with My Family

I think this is the first movie about a character that has ever been re-enacted. The cast really captured my emotion, and I felt it deep down! Saraya and her family should be extremely extremely proud of how well this cast portrayed their family! I read some people online giving Pugh some crap over being ""too chunky"" but honestly it couldn't have been done ANY better! Its hilarious and even if you aren't a wrestling fan, I think you might just laugh a little.... Or a lot!",Fighting with My Family
215,vprice94,Chav Rocky,1,12 August 2019,"What a truly horrid family. Imagine having to live next door to this insufferable bunch.The actress who plays Saraya-Jade Bevis, aka, Paige, is too cute and intelligent - hence she does NOT resemble (the real) Bevis in the slightest. It is a completely fictitious account. However, inside the ring, she appears very assured when performing as Paige (Bevis' ring name), so I'll gladly pass over some deserved credit for that.The problem I have is the family evoke zero empathy. They are trash. They possess zero manners. Zero education. Zero decorum. They're the loud family in the street that won't stop shouting, swearing and revving the car engine at all hours. I think every working-class street in the UK has a family like this. I know I do.The scene where Bevis' brother, Zack, starts a punch-up in the pub because he is jealous with rage over his sister's success may very well have happened in real life, but it is a sure misfire when trying evoke sympathy from the viewer. The guy is clearly a dangerous scümbag and should not be pitied.If you would like to see the REAL LIFE Bevis family, might I suggest you watch THE WRESTLERS: FIGHTING WITH MY FAMILY on YouTube, so you can get a true glimpse of how they really are.P.S. - In 2017 - and omitted from the film's timeline - various footage and nude images of Bevis were placed online.

The tone is flat and depressing, but not in a humorous way like The Office (UK). It somehow lacks energy despite the contrived attempts to conjure it up through rather inconsequential action sequences.I found the lead actress, Florence Pugh, insufferably wooden and emotionless. Perhaps that's the point, but her performance was grating. Vince Vaughan was decent as Hutch, the only redeemable character, though even he strayed into cliche territory as the failed coach archetype. I agree with another reviewer re 'phoned in' performances.Yes it seems to have some heart, but that doesn't make up for the fact FWMF is a plodding, dour and largely forgettable affair, and a huge disappointment considering Merchant's strong body of work.",Fighting with My Family

But now this does nothing for me.Although this movie gave good insight about those that dedicate their lives living the WWE fantasy, I got to say I wasn't one bit emotionally attached or interested.And why should anyone that isn't a WWE fan like this movie is beyond me.
It doesn't offer you insightful views of life, it doesn't carry any great message. If anything this movie is good at telling you just how fake WWE is and why you shouldn't care for it or waste time seeing the movie.Just because Dwayne is there that doesn't mean he'll singlehandedly sell the movie. And I can honestly say this movie does no favors in the career of any of the actors.Even the main character of the movie.
Why should you care if she makes or breaks it when the movie itself tells you, that every day people try out to enter the WWE world and are kicked out.There are much better movies out there. Much more insightful and actually helpful.

The journey towards the right path may seem difficult to others. To others it is what was chosen to be. When her big brother is pursuing his dream of becoming the next wrestling champion superstar, Saraya is seemingly dragged into this world when she becomes his sparring partner exchanging sweat & jockeys through their teenage quest. Though work is ahead as the next step in their walk is full-blown try-outs to make the big show.
The IT factor is something completely different than with other wrestlers a la the Ultimate Warrior. The Page turner is learning faster than she can give receipts that advancing to the next round is the circle of life. When the final tally shows up & Young Zak is crushed, yet manages to find the light & praise his little sister eventually. These parents are a class of their own staying true to what they believe will make a residual annual profit while never working a day in their life. It is time to leave emotions at the door, when going after the gold. Even being the youngest signee contract in WWE history, she still had to put in those candles burning at both end hours.
After months & months of preparation, the ""Sphinx riddle of judgement - The Never Ending Story (1984) at WrestleMania. She has the chance to gain advice from one of the biggest representatives of her sport. Seems destined & when given this golden egg, she turns into what Hollywood movies are made of. It keeps those of us coming back month after month. After a long match with the champion, the referee raises her hand in triumph to obtain the priceless events that transpired.

It's cool to watch a true story, particularly about such a unique narrative filled with eccentric people. The film had a great message - believe in yourself and others will believe in you too. But I have to say the documentary about the Knights is much more entertaining and full off life, as brooding and wonderfully diverse Florence Pugh was in the film, she has nothing of the charisma Saraya Knight has. It's a nice film to watch about a triumph over adversity, discovering your self-identity and success against the odds, but 70 percent of the narrative was super serious and slow paced - I guess I wasn't expecting that!

But Awesome",9,14 March 2019,"Add to dictionarySplitFighting with my Family tells the true story of WWE Diva Saraya 'Paige' Bevis, a young British wrestler that took the WWE by storm. Saraya (played brilliantly by Florence Pugh), comes from a family of Wrestlers from Nowrich in the UK, her mother and Father, Ricky and Julia Knight (Hilariously played by Nick Frost and GoT's Lena Heady) are also wrestlers and encourage Saraya and her bother Zak (Jack Lowden in his best performance IMHO) to follow in their footsteps. Zak lives and breathes wrestling and he and Saraya train local children and teenagers in the family Wrestling gym (including a blind lad and a weak willed weed dealer who Zak attempts to steer in the right direction). Ricky and Julia constantly phone the WWE to try and promote Zak and Saraya.The Knight family are very close (there is an elder brother, Roy who earlier in the movie is in prison for a Violent crime, his release is shown later). Zak announces his girlfriend is pregnant and he wants to settle down with her, and meet her middle-class parents in a hilarious dinner scene. During this scene, Saraya gets a phone call from Hutch Morgan (Vince Vaughn), a WWE scout who tells her he's very impressed with her and Zak's tape that Ricky had sent them previously and that SmackDown (one of WWE's brand shows) was coming to London, and would like for them to try out. This is the break that the whole family were waiting for.They both go to the try outs and impress the coach, but only Saraya gets chosen to go to Florida to train at WWE's developmental centre, leaving Zak heartbroken.I won't spoilt anymore, I'll leave you to enjoy Saraya's story. I'll comment on the performances of the actors. Florence Pugh seems to have captured Paige's attitude, and her struggles to fit into the world she's thrust into. Jack Lowden's performances as devastated Zak is nothing short of spectacular, you really feel bad for him as he comes to terms with his huge let down, cheer for him when he accepts his fate and makes the best of it. Nick Frost and Lena Heady play her parents hilariously (the dinner scene when explaining to their son's girlfriend's parents about wrestling injuries will make you burst out laughing, and the training gym's ""Stiffy"" scene). The film shows, with a degree of truth, a slice of Working-Class culture in England, and how Saraya adjusts to the glamourous US WWE lifestyle. You can expect the usual small cameos of real WWE wrestlers playing themselves (The Rock, Shamus and Big Show) and members of the Bevis family playing smaller parts).All in all, this is a British/American comedy that both UK and US audiences will understand as it contains scenes of both nation's lifestyles (in wrestling) but the fact it's based on a true story certainly adds to the feel-good factor.",Fighting with My Family

The plot itself is fresh and full of life, telling a pretty unique spin on the typical sports film.I really, really liked FWMF, but felt it could have been superior if it had some of the cheesy lines trimmed and some of the scenes shortened.
It was the editor who let this movie down; so many lines of dialogue that were unnecessary to the movie were left uncut.

There are a few bits in the film like that but I didn't let them pull away the enjoyment I did feel when watching it. I'd heard of Florence Pugh before this film but not seen her in anything and after watching this I'd definitely be more interested in watching something if it has her name attached to it now. Vince Vaughn was back on form with this film! I've only seen him in rubbish films for quite a while but this performance really reminded me of what a good actor he is when given a good role in a good film.

Not pretty. Then decades later WWE arrived from the US. It was splashy and trashy and everyone was a bit nastier but certainly a lot easier on the eye. But, somehow, it just wasn't for me. When fighting with my family came along however, it seemed to mash those two worlds together and I thought I'd give it a go.I had watched a trailer a while ago and thought it was a comedy. It certainly is funny- very funny in fact, but it also had something I was not expecting- fantastic acting and real depth. Based on a true story about a crazy British family who are broken and shattered by a criminal background but are somehow saved by wrestling and the dream of one day travelling across the pond and making it big in WWE.Written and directed by Stephen Merchant, I should have known this would be better than most, but the central performances by Florence Pugh and on screen brother Jack Lowden are mind blowing. The film is not without cliches, but it delivers at a pace and is never dull. Incidentally it was great to see the real family at the end and you realise that over the top portrayal of the family had actually been underplayed when you see the real thing. The Dad in particular played brilliantly by Nick Frost is someone you really couldn't imagine exists in real life- but he does!I loved the blind kid. I loved the heart and soul of the film. It is told from the perspective of love within a non conformist family and it works. I would be interested to see how American audiences reacted to this very British viewpoint of a very American dream.One thing I never expected is that I now have a real respect for WWE.

I'm familiar with Paige through sporadic watching here and there and seeing her on Total Divas and am certainly not a fan of her or how she carries herself but this film was a fairly fun albeit cliched film.The film tells the story of Saraya ""Paige"" Bevis and her background. Her family are all wrestling crazed and put on wrestling shows and train others in Norwich. Paige and her brother get called up for a WWE tryout but only Paige makes the cut.

But this film is everything for both those that Rocky was for masculinity and boxing. And much more. Paige is a heroine for everyone, female or male, who dreams of breaking stereotypes... Or more importantly, simply ignoring stereotypes to pursue their dreams. And while I don't follow wrestling, I do admire the training and skill Paige and her family undergo to peruse their dreams.Bravo to Stephan Merchant, The Rock, Paige, and the Knight family (apologies if that's not their real name) for a wonderful, honest, inspiring and heartmelting story.",Fighting with My Family

269,aaronburley-43699,A great modern under dog story.,6,6 July 2019,"Stephen Merchant is a wonderful comedian, but with his new film it shows that he is also a wonderful storyteller able to tell when things need to be funny and when things need to be serious. He sews the comedy and the tragedy together perfectly to create an absoloutely brilliant underdog story.(I don't know much about the true story that the film is based off, so I can't really add anything to that when it comes to accuracies.)Florence Pugh is incredible in her part as ""Saraya Knight"", a young wrestler from Norwich who breaks out from her fighting-family to seek fortune at the WWE. I won't spoil it but things don't end up the way she hoped, not just at the WWE but things go south back in England too.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson also makes a few cameo appearances every once in a while, playing himself as per usual. Not really much to comment on him as he is just there to add some star-power to the film as well as furthering the plot a little here and there.Stephen Merchant with his first big-hit directorial film is a great feel-good film that is sure to finally throw him into brighter lights - which is something I am absolutely thrilled by. He has done a terrific job and I cannot wait to see what he does next, whatever it is I bet It will be extraordinairy.You do not need to know much about wrestling or the WWE to appreciate the film, it might add a little context but it doesn't take anything away from it if you aren't interested in that sort of thing. It's a classic under dog story that brings laughs and tears, a film for anyone who wants to enjoy themselves.Well done Merchant.",Fighting with My Family

I wish I never wasted money on this junk, trying to take the story of a British working class family into the wrestling business and turning into some kind of comedy drama does not work for me. I would of prefered to see a more dark side to the struggles that such a addiction to Wrestling from a skint family would cause, the blood, sweat and tears, then a nice happy ending to finish it off. Instead I get nearly 2 hours of cheese, sorry maybe only a hour because I fell asleep on and off during this.
I can only imagine, this is trying to attract little girls like my daughter to enjoy, a bit like the way the wrestling pg era is like these days.

278,joost-de-haan,"Too dumbed down, who is this for, unlikeable, annoying",5,8 October 2021,"It has been several months since I saw this movie, but it actually annoyed and still annoys me enough to write this review. Having said that:The story of the career of Paige is somewhat interesting, so I get why they would turn it into a movie. What I don't get is why it is such an unbalanced selection of events from reality, why it has to be simplified and dumbed down to this extent, and hammed up in other places.I can ignore the factual errors where timeframes don't match up with the titlebelts that are used in flashbacks, but wrestling is scripted: that's simplified in this movie to ""You know the outcome"", so that makes me question who this movie is made for. I would think for wrestling fans, but it's so simplified it becomes annoying and the suspension of disbelief required is too much.There are feuds in wrestling that are built or that have crucial launching moments: Those were there in reality for Paige, but for some reason they aren't this movie, shooting the story in the leg whenever possible.All these things could have been forgiven if the rest of the movie was solid, but it suffers from a very unlikeable main character; And I'm unsure how much of it is to blame on the actress. She looks bored almost all of the time, even when she's supposed to be angry/sad/confused. And those emotions are only skin deep it seems. What's worse is that she seems to dumb to normally deal with emotions, flipflopping her mindset and motivation several times. Several other characters do this a lot better, making this stick out like a sore thumb even more.Watch what really happened in WWE over this.",Fighting with My Family

So right out the back I was expecting a different level of film. What I got was something completely fun and entertaining, with a lot of really touching moments and of course enough wrestling sprinkled on throughout the film to at least satisfy the name sake.If you are a wrestling fan and know who the film is about then this was a treat to actually get some theatrical truish biopic of the wrestler. if you don't know who she is, but love wrestling then you will still get a really good story about the struggles she goes thru to make it into the top. Now for those of you who don't really follow wrestling or know who the film is about, i can say you will like this film for its dramatic use and over all coming of age/transformation story that highlights the female struggle in a male driven industry.Either way this is a really good story and its well done, a lot of exciting part that will drive you to the edge of your seat unless your a stump, and over all just done right.",Fighting with My Family

285,beardsmore,"Stephen Merchant shines a new light on an often mocked industry, in a fascinating biopic of one of the WWE's most influential women ever.",8,11 March 2019,"Being British and a professional wrestling fan, seeing Stephen Merchant's biographical 'Fighting With My Family' filled me with a sense of joy. It felt like the little bubble of the wrestling fanbase was opening up to a general audience. Having only seen this film as a long time fan, my opinion may be a little biased, but moments like an early scene where Saraya (who will come to be known as WWE's Paige) and a few other young wrestlers are advertising their local event, provide a perfect example of the stereotyping professional wrestling enthusiasts face. As a group of girls call our protagonist a freak and tell her how wrestling is fake, they could not possibly have imagined that at aged 26, she would have a movie about her life and career as arguably one of the best female wrestlers of all time. The trials and tribulations she faces on her journey, (particularly WWE's refusal to sign her brother, Zak Zodiac) make for a bumpy road for Saraya on the path to achieving her dream, with each victory and defeat acted out brilliantly by Florence Pugh in a role she is absolutely perfect in. She's pushed to her limits in America by unyielding coach Vince Vaughn, but her successes are contrasted with the sombre reality of life in a small English wrestling promotion for her brother, who is forced to sit idly by whilst his sister achieves his dream for him. It is at these points the film really hits home, the side of the wrestling business you never get to see is that of the people who don't make it. His struggle to cope with his failure culminates in a brilliant bar fight soundtracked by Christmas music, which for me is one of the standout and memorable scenes. There's not a bad performance in the movie, from the brooding nature of Jack Lowden's portrayal of Zak through to the always entertaining Nick Frost, as the father just trying to make ends meet. The family dynamic ensures the film's humour is relatable and on point, striking a great balance between some genuinely funny moments and some genuinely powerful ones. I'm unsure just how accurate certain sections of this movie are, I know for a fact that Paige's debut the night after Wrestlemania 30 pans out differently in the movie than in real life, but the version here is more fitting in terms of the story we are told, and it makes the final pay off just that bit more special. 'Fighting With My Family' ends just as Paige' story was beginning, the next few years of her life would be flaunt with emotion following scandals and being forced to retire from wrestling due to injury. The hope from wrestling fans is that this film shines a new light on our crazy passion, making it more mainstream in the eyes of the general audience, at a time when the sport perhaps needs it more than ever.",Fighting with My Family

However, if you are a fan of Paige, or the Knight family at all, you will quickly start to see fictionalized moments, exaggerations and inaccuracies. Now of course, it's going to pump in the Hollywood magic to try and help the movie. The Rock is throughout the movie, and while he wasn't truly vital to Paige's career, his scenes are fun. The actors do an amazing job with their roles, and have very comedic chemistry. This movie is witty and charming but is all over the place.

302,mctaiatini,NON WRESTLING FANS BE PREPARED TO BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED BY THIS FAMILY'S LOVE FOR EACH OTHER!!!,10,20 November 2020,I was pleasantly surprised how this family played by actors is exactly how family actually live in reality. Both siblings Zak (played by Jack Lowden) and his sister Paige aka Saraya (played by Florence Pugh) dreams are to get chosen to train with the best WWE wrestlers in the U.S as this is what they both have trained for by what looks like by their parents in the opening fighting scenes in the ring shows Paige getting hammered by her mum!The day comes for both siblings Zak and Paige to try out for their dream to wrestle in the U.S with the best!!! Zal is ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE by his performance and because of his experience he is confident he will get chosen and he also has high hopes for his sister Paige. After their try outs they both wait in anticipation for the scout (played by Vince Vaughn) to tell them the good news The scout selected 1 alright and not the one you would expect considering the lead up to the try outs. He only chose Paige and as the loyal sister would do Paige questioned why her brother hadn't been chosen as well and fought for his honor. As older brothers do Zak reminds her of it being their dream and he wants her to go to the U.S and show them how it's done in England. When Zak is by himself you could see his hopes draining from his eyes and I guess as hurt does you want to do stupid things which he does but Paige tried to ring him many times from the U.S as Zak always knows how to make her feel better about her decisions as Paige doesn't have the confidence Zak does. To her dismay her big brother never picks up and if he does he always cuts the phone calls short so Paige doesn't hear the disappointment in his voice.Well people... like I said for the NON WRESTLING FANS TOO! Have a watch I promise you will be as surprised as I was when I watched this movie. It's more about how the family unit cope together and while Paige is in the U.S and also about how Paige copes without her family who have been by her side every day teaching her the skill set she knows today. I really enjoyed this movie and I AM DEFINITELY NOT A WRESTLING FAN!!!,Fighting with My Family

It was also nice to see Hutch's character evolves throughout the film, from being an unlikeable person to sort of a father figure for Paige.I felt the film was a bit too fast towards the end; I hoped the film would go on for another 10 minutes or so to show how life was for Paige after her success, but regardless it was an excellent film that deserves all the praise it received.",Fighting with My Family

After having heard a few good things about this movie, it was time to check it out. The first 10 minutes of the movie serves as a decent introduction to the story. There is good set up, even if most the jokes aren't hilarious. With each subsequent scene, however, this movie continued to impress me. The jokes get funnier, the stakes become higher & the wonderful screenplay by Stephen Merchant got me totally invested in this world of wrestling.
Florence Pugh shines as always (she has such a bright future ahead of her). She's able to take this rough around the edges outcast who loves fighting from likeable, to unlikeable, to likeable again by time the movie is over. I gotta give a shoutout to Vince Vaughn & Dwayne Johnson for also giving awesome performances here. Vaughn may act like his usual persona here, but when he has good material to work with, it all comes together in an entertaining (sometimes moving) way.

310,independently-poor2,The Cast is better than the movie,6,28 May 2020,"Let me start by saying that this film is run-o-the-mill, formulaic, predictable. Stephen Merchant (the frequent Ricky Gervais partner) presents a rather pedantic melodrama that does little but lay on the mat for the three count. But let's face it, I'm not a wrestling fan, I'm not the target audience. I've never heard of Paige and don't give a toss about the vaunted WWE. I'm a fan of movies. And this one is just humdrum.Having said that, there is two, even three, reasons to watch this flick, and they're all about the cast. I'm not going to talk about the always outstanding Lena Headey because everyone knows she's AWESOME. But I'll recommend this film for three other reasons.First is Nick Frost. He may be familiar to you as Simon Pegg's buddy in such films as ""Shaun of the Dead"", ""Hot Fuzz"", ""The World's End"", etc.). He has since carved out a niche for himself stepping out from under Simon's shadow. As always, his acting is subtle, nuanced, and (most importantly) believable. Instead of going big (which, for lesser actors, might have been the way to go), Nick portrays Ricky Knight as a human being. Nicely done Nick. This film is worth watching for this performance alone,. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE.Second, is the break-out performance of Jack Lowden (""Dunkirk"", ""Calibre"", ""Mary Queen of Scots"", etc.). He put on a stone and a half or so of muscle to play the real-life brother of Saraya (Britani/ Paige--aka the main character). While the direction makes this a rather formulaic presentation, Jack's portrayal of Zak Zodiac allows the audience to become invested in more than just the main character. Put a pin in this one, Jack Lowden is a rising star. He's someone to keep your eye on.But the main reason to watch ""Fighting with My Family"" is the ALWAYS impressive Florence Pugh. To be transparent, I have to admit that I've become a fan of this young actor. ""Little Drummer Girl"", ""Lady Macbeth"", ""Midsommar"", etc. But, let's face it, the secret's out. She's in demand; and rightly so. Her work is phenomenal. She's so natural, so real that you forget it's a movie. If you want to see an outstanding actress at work, just check out her filmography. And I mean watch anything--you won't be disappointed. She can carry a film or mini-series, or what-have-you. I STRONGLY recommend this film simply because Florence Pugh is in it. I needn't say more.So, in sum, the film is pedantic. It's run-o-the-mill, it's humdrum, BUT--and this is a BIG BUT--the cast is well worth it. If you want to watch some really wonderful performances, this film is a showcase of talent. What can I say, Nick Frost is building a fantastic career, Jack Lowden is coming into his own, and--let's face it--I'd watch anything with Florence Pugh's in it.BTW, if you're a WWE fan, remember, it's a movie. When you're making a film, you don't have time to explain everything. Some things and characters are compressed for time. So, just sit back and relax a bit. And remember, the Knight family are on record saying that their lives are presented essentially accurately and they're extremely happy with the way they're portrayed. So enjoy!",Fighting with My Family

318,Slipperytwizzle,A delight!,8,26 March 2019,"It's funny but tough, don't get me wrong. You have to be really tough to even stand a chance. You have to develop your own persona and deal with hecklers. Our central character Saraya has issues with her image. The other girls' she's selected with, on the surface, seem perfect, and she resents them. Until she realises they've got their problems too. Vince Vaughn is very encouraging but is essentially battle scarred from all the years on the road training these wannabee superstars. He believes the life is not for Saraya but deep down wants to be proven wrong. Saraya's brother Zak back home is conflicted to the point of being bitter and vicious, only to stress the point that he really believes his sister can go the whole way (he was rejected in the early stages) and doesn't want her to throw it all away.But anyway, she makes a speech at the end that would make even the most battle hardened sports journalist like you well up and be inspired. In terms of humour there's loads of it coming in spades from Merchant, Frost and Duane Johnson. Who, until fairly recently was an untapped comedic resource. That guy can do anything.

I was at Wrestlemania XXX and Raw in NOLA and I was extremely disappointed at the end of this movie. I like Paige and was excited to get a little back story on her. I didnt have an issue with the movie until the end. It was completely BS. I understand that you have to fill in and make a little up to make it a good movie but when you completely change something that was aired live I just couldn't believe it.

340,CactusCalf,Sometimes your left aghast!,8,26 March 2019,"It happens to all of us sometimes. We've all walked out of a cinema a little aghast. Most of the time that's due to a huge disappointment, when a film can't match the hype that prevails it. But sometimes, just sometimes, you're aghast for the right reasons. You just want to turn around and head straight back in. Re-absorb what you've just seen. For me the later happened thanks to 'Fighting with my Family'. (Have I set the bar too high!?!?)
Hyped as the true story of WWEs Divas Champion Paige's rise to fame, supported with cameos by WWE hall of famers, you'd be within your rights to presume this is another film from the WWE propaganda portfolio. Solely aimed at fully paid up members of the WWE universe. Let's face it, WWE is probably the best self-promoting brand in the world. It probably has more influence than it should. I've always thought that if there was a second civil war in America it'll start on 'Monday Night RAW'. A white suited Colonel facing off with a hipster NY artisan coffee house franchiser owner. The coffee shop owner 'coffee grinding' the Colonel into submission. Or something like that.
Just to position myself, I'm a viewer that wants to like WWE. I like the humour. The over the top moments. The element of risk. But I've never been fully immersed in the weekly pantomime. Mainly down to being too tight to pay monthly subscription fees or dedicate the viewing hours. So, I guess I'm a WWE sympathiser. Willing and wanting to believe. For me FWMF hits all the right WWE buttons. But, importantly, it doesn't exclude you if you are a none believer.
Equally, FWMF could be just another rehash of a rags to rich's sporting story.
Girl is a fan of sport. Girl has a go a sport. Girl gets spotted by scout. Girl gets given big chance. Girl gets knocked back. Girl wants to give up. Girl gets supported by family. Girl digs deep. Girl takes big chance. etc. etc. etc.
And do you know what, FWMF doesn't divert from that tried and tested storyboard spine. It is as written above. But then again, why is that a problem? You want a feel-good story? Check. Family torn between love and jealousy, but ultimately pulling together? Check. The urge to cheer out loud at the films climax? Check.
For me 'FWMF' hits all the right notes for a standard feel-good sports movie, with extra sprinklings of WWE nostalgia, but the cherry on-top comes from the comic one-liners. That's what pushes it past the rest. Stephen Merchant has taken another step out from under Gervais's shadow here. The laughs are packed in with regularity. But not shoehorned in. They materialise organically then evaporate just as naturally. Any film that can stick the line 'I've got a hammer on a stick' in, then simply move on without explanation is genius.
To a lesser degree FWMF also tackles some bigger issues, albeit not spinning them out fully. It touches on mental anguish of our dreams being shattered as well as miss-judgment of people based on looks. The second of which, it dealt with so excellently that it turns the mirror on the viewer for a, albeit brief, moment of self-reflection. Again, pushing FWMF ahead of its feel-good peers.
It must have been Merchants script that enabled the casting directors to pull in numerous recognisable Hollywood names. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, Vince Vaughan, Lena Headey and Nick Frost. They gel with Florence Pugh's lead and Jack Lowden's supporting-lead. Not one character steals the show, it's the combination of all that makes it work.
That's really the key to FWMF. As a WWE nostalgia trip, it could work. As a British influenced comedy, it could work. As a combination of Hollywood players, it could work. As a run of a mill sporting success movie, it could work. But put it all together and you've got a genuine 'feel good movie of the year'. And that's the bottom-line cos I said so. BANG, BANG!",Fighting with My Family

The whole family wrestle eachother, the daughter is a late-comer to the party, but with the guidance of her older brother she becomes integral to the families desire to one day crack the big time at the WWE.With Merchant at the helm, I came into this with the expectation that this was a comedy, there is certainly some attempt at comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing once.Unfortunately, what we get is a well constructed sports film following the obvious formula. The daughter (Florence Pugh) is the main focus of the film, and while she is easy on the eye, I didn't find her performance up to the task, though she clearly did a lot of the wrestling moves herself.Overall there was some interesting juxtaposition between a down trodden small town british family and the dazzle of WWE wrestling, a few cameos, (Vince Vaughn is as solid as ever), but this film didn't really stray from the underdog story, or provide enough drama or comedy to make it worth it.",Fighting with My Family

359,AdamThorley,Fighting With My Family: a Worthy Tribute to Paige?,9,23 June 2019,"If you're a fan of the WWE, it's highly likely you would have heard of Paige. Following her success in NXT, Paige became the youngest ever Divas Champion at the age of 21. She then helped shape the women's revolution, which changed the way the female division is viewed. In quite a short period of time, Paige's successes are quite remarkable. Fighting with My Family is a brand new biopic based on Paige's journey to the WWE, featuring a true story consisting of dreams, family feuds, and a splash of comedy.Paige (real name Saraya-Jade Bevis) gets her first in-ring experience at age 13, being thrown into a wrestling match at the family-run business WAW (World Association of Wrestling). Despite not being interested in competing, she quickly learns to love the thrill of wrestling, and it is obvious that a lot of talent lies within. Fast forward to age 18, and along with brother Zak (Jack Lowden) and her parents, Paige helps to train people in the local area in wrestling, as well as putting on shows for WAW. It's here that the opportunity of a lifetime arrives: a shot at the WWE. When only Paige is selected to go to NXT, a destroyed Zak turns his back on his sister, leaving her lonely and isolated whilst training in Florida. Struggling to fit in, we witness Paige go through some tough mental and physical battles, and a lot of self-doubt. ""Be the best you"" says The Rock, when Paige and brother Zak ask for advice on how to steal the show, and this is a theme which carries throughout the film. When Paige takes this in full stride, we get to enjoy some inspiring, uplifting moments, all the way up to her debut on Monday Night Raw in April 2014.Florence Pugh is incredible as Paige, blending into the role perfectly, with even the iconic scream sounding like the real deal. As part of her journey to the WWE, Paige battles loneliness and struggles to fit in, scenes which Pugh portrays brilliantly. This is a brutal world where a dream can be killed in an instant, with every move under intense scrutiny. Paige is an incredibly likeable character and watching her become more and more isolated and depressed is heart-breaking and tough to watch. Pugh's ability to master both intense and comedic scenes should not be understated, as we see in some of the more uplifting scenes. Paige's relationship with Vince Vaughn's WWE trainer Hutch Morgan is a particular highlight, featuring both highs and lows. Quick-witted jabs between the two score a laugh from the audience, whilst some of the more tender moments allow Paige to open up to the human side of Hutch.A mixture of young talent and some familiar faces complete the rest of the cast, with big names including Nick Frost, Lena Headey and Vince Vaughn featuring. Producer Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson also has a couple of scenes in the film, due to his involvement in Paige's WWE journey. The Rock broke the news to the real Paige that she would be making her WWE debut in 2014 on the following nights Monday Night RAW, and had been aware of the Bevis family since seeing a documentary focused on them in 2012. The debut would fall the night after WrestleMania, WWE's biggest annual event, and Paige would win her first title there. It's brilliant to see a scene of such importance re-enacted in the film, featuring the man who delivered the news himself. There are even a couple of WWE cameos in the film, such as Sheamus and the Big Show backstage, all of which help add to the authentic feel of the movie and are real fan-pleasing moments.Writer and director Stephen Merchant deserves a lot of credit for the way he showcases the gruelling pain that people involved in wrestling must endure. Wrestlers are shown being thrown around, taking a bowling ball in the groin, and even being thrown onto a canvas covered in pins. Yes, this gets a few gasps in the cinema, but this is exactly what wrestlers must put their body through many times a week, all in the name of entertainment. Similar to a stage play, each person must hit every move perfectly, engage with the crowd, and always be on top form. The pain is all real, and Merchant must be commended for getting this across to cinema viewers. ""It's all fake isn't it"" is a line muttered near the start of the movie. Not at all.But alongside this, Merchant has added a coat of comedy to the movie, one which helps make the film feel very light-hearted and a joy to watch. Whilst never overshadowing the important emotional scenes, the comedy adds to the story and is genuinely funny. The dynamic amongst the Bevis family is hilarious, with a family meal featuring Zak's girlfriends' parents a highlight. When dad Ricky is ordered to put a shirt on for the meal, he suitably wears a Norwich City football shirt. One of the locals Paige is training on how to perform headlocks is ordered to do push-ups for ""having a stiffy"". And the Rock dropping in an insult about Vin Diesel is just perfect, all of which makes Fighting with My Family a really fun ride.Having an interest in WWE prior to watching Fighting with My Family, I found myself engrossed and wanting more. The movie ends following Paige's WWE RAW debut, where she claimed the Divas Championship. Whilst the credits reference Paige's achievements following this night, an epilogue featuring Pugh re-enacting the events in the following years would have been great to see. Clips alongside the credits of the real Paige are a nice touch in place of this, however. There are also some minor deviations as to how Paige won the title in real life, although I feel that these actually benefit the movie by adding to the suspense.Fighting with My Family is one of the most enjoyable films of the year so far, and one which I cannot wait to experience again. Merchant has successfully crafted an accessible film, one which is uplifting and at times very relatable. Sure, fans of the WWE and Paige will likely take away more from the film. The moments will have a greater meaning, knowing the success Paige had in helping progress the WWE forward. But like Rocky, this is an underdog story, full of inspirational moments, featuring an important message of being yourself. With all the positive changes going on in the WWE at this moment as a result of Paige's involvement in the women's revolution, there is no better time to experience her story.Overall Score: 9/10",Fighting with My Family

362,ha060244-680-731288,I might as well have re-watched Rocky,5,27 February 2019,Oh dear....this movie was boring. I might was well have gone and re-watch the Rocky it was basically a remake of that film. The awfully boring plucky under dog story where the main hero has to go through austerity to reach their goal and win against superior opponents ? Before any one blast me I know that Paige did win the Championship in RL at her first fight. But did she have to go through various tryouts and trying camp that looks like US army? give me break. I know she had some tryouts with wwe but centering the plot off the movie around that? well in my humble opinion that makes for very weak script in my opinion and that the RL story this film is supposed to be based on doesn't have enough substance to be properly told...so why make this film at all then...In comparison Rocky (fictional boxing Icon) starts out like Paige as plucky under dog with bags of potential then goes trough lot of ridiculous trainings after losing his first fight with Appalo (just like Paige who lose almost every fight in the film before winning the final fight) so he can take on the superior Appalo Creed for the second time and beats him to the title. So a film that its complete fiction managed to tell the plucky underdog story better than film that is supposed to be based on RL professional wrestler.The highlight of this movie is The Rock he gets the best lines in the film. Nick Frost just looks weird without Simon Pegg. I know he has done works without Pegg before but its first I see him without Pegg. Vince Vaughn he just rehash his role from Hackshaw Ridge the biopic about World War II hero Desmond Doss who refused to carry a gun when he served as medic. He is actually better there than in Fighting with My Family in the exact same role an obnoxious Sergent/coach. A bio pic that is actually worth seeing. As for the main actress well I haven't seen her in anything else to make comment on her...but I think she did well with that little she was given to work with.,Fighting with My Family

365,cmurray528462,Fighting with how great this movie is.,9,2 April 2019,"Well hello wrestling!! Best feel good movie so far this year. Based on a true story so I was instantly interested but furthermore the fact that it's set in England obviously kept me interested in the pretense. As I sat with my bottle of water and my baked pea crisps I really got into the story line, more than I did the baked pea crisps . The movie led with humour so I was into it like a one-toothed farmer is into a corn cob eating competition. There's the obviously brilliant cast, loved the appearance of Stephen Merchant and I came away with a saying I'll be using a lot, ""Dick me to death and bury me pregnant"". Yes, we all know the Rock is in it and he definitely delivers. There's ups and downs in this movie, I won't lie I did use a tissue...and more importantly I didn't need to look at my phone at all. Clare's Compelling Reviews gives this movie an admirable 4.5 stars.Fighting with my Family",Fighting with My Family
366,joeyingling,"Predictable, But So Very Well Done",8,11 August 2019,"You may find at first this to be an oh so predictable rags to Rich's tale, but the storyline and characters are so well developed, before you know it, you're in.
Admittedly a fan of Stephen Merchant's work, he's brilliant once again as he's so perfectly intermingled laugh out loud moments with the drama of the story being told.
We were well prepared to find this a so-so, let's kill some time film, that I think we were surprised how quickly became so fond of it- and we're not wrestling fans.Highly recommend to anyone who needs a feel good moment. And to Mr. Merchant- once again, we'll done you !",Fighting with My Family
367,allen-81081,Loved it...,9,5 May 2019,"Not a big fan of wrestling at all, but my family and I really enjoyed watching this movie.",Fighting with My Family
368,urge-forfor,Funny! Entertaining!,10,18 February 2019,"With current poltical noise and extreme Winter climes, I chose to go and see this movie. It's hilarious, filled with tender, and endearing moments. Worth the money! Thanks to The Rock!",Fighting with My Family
369,dan-09263,Best wrestling movie since ready to rumble,10,24 February 2019,Nailed it! Hope this is the first of many more WWE superstar inspired films. Really peeled back the curtain into the universe behind the universe.,Fighting with My Family
370,joemccormack-64845,Easy watch for anyone,7,12 January 2020,"Fighting with my Family is a beautifully written heart-felt comedy about the origins and life of WWE superstar Paige, and is one of the easiest going movies I've watched in some time.This movie is made by the brilliant acting performances led by Florence Pugh and supported by a surprisingly straight but not too serious Vince Vaughan. Supporting roles from Nick Frost and Lena Heady are played to perfection with fantastic comedic timing and range of emotion.However, as a wrestling fan myself, this movie was at times frustrating. If you're familiar with how NXT operates, or even just the way in which wrestling is scripted, this will frustrate you. The movie shows wrestling matches as if the outcome hasn't been pre-determined, and even promo segments haven't been given a direction.That's why it is in my belief that this movie will resonate more with those who don't know/aren't necessarily a fan of wrestling. It's a feel-good comedy with the classic message of never giving up on your dreams.For wrestling fans, there are cameos from many WWE stars (as well as a bizarre inside joke about Pete Dunne) and the Rock is at his best here.If you're looking for a movie that won't require too much concentration and passes a couple of hours nicely then this movie is for you!",Fighting with My Family
371,huggybear-32178,Awesome movie,10,7 January 2020,"I actually watched it when Paige beat AJ Lee and became the youngest WWE Divas champion. The film made me tear up at the end.
Loved seeing how she overcame challenges at NXT and proved she could do it.
Awesome movie and made me laugh too.
Recommend if your a Wrestling fan or not",Fighting with My Family
372,nicholaswycliffe,Fighting with my family,9,3 March 2019,"Pretty awesome, I enjoyed it because it was based on a true story.",Fighting with My Family
373,joemaciphone,Not a wrestling fan but a huge fan of small (ish) budget movies,9,2 January 2020,"No spoilers!!I really enjoyed this movie, Its took me a while to realise this was actually a true story and that just made it even better.I'm now typing this at least 2 hours after watching the movie and I've spend all of the time between browsing the net and filling in any gaps.
This is a very good example of the beauty of 2 worlds colliding. The glamour of WWE and Hollywood blended with the grit and realism of Norwich and British film making.WATCH IT NOW",Fighting with My Family
374,nodellis,Loved it!,10,3 March 2019,"Hilarious, punchy script and great acting. A mixture of down to earth British humour and earthiness, sprinkled with hollywood glamour.
I agree you don't have to be a wrestling fan to love this film but I can see a lot of people going to see this and then getting into WWE and British wrestling.
I will definitely go and see it again and think it will become a British classic.",Fighting with My Family
375,kruno-84642,Wasn't something that I expected to see,5,30 April 2019,"From the trailer I thought there will be more action etc..but when I saw the movie and realized that the ""Rock"" Dwayne Johnson has veery small part in it and on the poster it is in the first line, It gets 5stars. Sry but cannot do more",Fighting with My Family
376,pemorresnicolle,Good fun overall,7,15 March 2019,"It's a well done if slightly predictable ""underdog"" story. Merchants script is touching without too much schmaltz and quite amusing too. All the performances are solid especially the underrated Nick Frost as the tough but kind hearted father. Pugh is also great as Paige herself getting the balance right between street girl with attitude and insecure outsider.",Fighting with My Family
377,BigNikkrDikk,decent WATCHABLE film,6,14 February 2019,Not fully aware of paige and her families history and due to that i may have fewer things i dislike about it. The movie was pretty good for a casual fan you will obviously know some things were added to make it more interesting although a little bit more effort could have been added. Zelina Vega in no way represented AJ Lee from her look our even attire which i felt they may have gotten lazy on. Overall pretty decent movie felt a bit rushed and like some info was left out but was a nice attempt at putting a biopic of sorts together on a person who doesnt have extended history and a long list of memorable events in her career. I think a few other female superstars could have shined better with something like this but for what it was worth it was watchable.,Fighting with My Family
378,devinwyatt,MoreThan Nostalgia,9,22 February 2019,"Fighting With My Family Review: ""More Than Nostalgia""
by: Devin Wyatt
Do you smell what The Rock is cookin? In case your not a huge wrestling fan thats a popular catch phrase of the 90s from the most electrifying man in sports entertainment, its also the first words you hear watching this film which instanly took me back to childhood days of eating KFC and watching Friday Night Smackdown!! Followed by a montage of great 90s momments this film doesnt fail at putting a smile to a WWE fan or even a non fan of wrestling. The actors give amazing emotional performances that come off as believable and sincere. They set out to tell this amazing story of Paige's journey to the WWE and how her family becomes a big part of her growth despite many dysfuntional issues. Florence Pugh kills it as Paige with her believable and intense performance from the way she cries to the way she slams in the ring!The Director Stephen Merchant (""Hot Fuzz"", ""Logan"") did some of his best work with directing this film. Not only was reconecting with Nick Frost from Hot Fuzz completely awesome, It was should I say eyebrow raising(Another Rock Pun). This film feels as if its an independent feel, with a lot of close up intimate shots of characters, dialoge driven momments, great pacing. The fighting sequences are clear for you to see, the editing is great so you are able to see the motions of the match fluently. I almost wish that WWE matches gave you that close of a camera view to the action in the ring. This film has some special apperances from The Big Show, The Miz, Aj Lee, Sheamus, commentary from ringside, and The Rock. The Rock adds the fuel to an bonfire with his energy and authenticity, with him in scences with Paige and her brother Zack, it certaintly makes this story feel real and believable. It takes us through what it really takes to become a WWE wrestler and in my opioion is came off to me as insporational.
On another note I would have liked to see more WWE superstars , I mean its a WWE film I would've liked to see some more legends like Undertaker Triple H, maybe even Lita and Trish Stratus. All in all this is a great film showing the gritty side of wrestling but also showing you the joy it brings to fans. Such an empowering film for women, A beautiful example of working through family problems and sticking together, and a guide on how to not give up on your dreams! Now go see this movie ""AND THATS THE BOTTOM-LINE CAUSE STONE-COLD SAID SO"".Grade: B+",Fighting with My Family
379,gracieloufreebush-03389,Let's Talk AJ Lee,4,23 February 2019,"First, Zelina Vega actually did a fair job of representing Aj Lee. The mannerisms and fluctuation of her voice resembled Aj a lot. The sad part is that she did not look anything like Aj Lee.Other comments/reviews think that the movie did not have the ""rights"" to dress Zelina in Aj's signature attire. Instead of love bites merch, Jean shorts, and Chuck Taylors, Zelina wore a mix between her own wardrobe and a Bella Twin. Odd, because this was part of the ""super model"" stereo type that Aj Lee never associated herself with. WWE owns the rights to Aj Lee and helped make this movie so it was possible to recreat the outfit. They chose not to because they can't have ""Aj Lee"" look like Aj Lee in the movie because they're trying to make it look like Paige was the first and only wrestler to break the ""supermodel"" wrestling stereo type.Sorry, Aj Lee was the first and her ACTUAL ring attire proves that. Paige is interesting enough to make this movie good without discrediting Aj Lee. Paige wouldn't exist at that time if it wasn't for the mold that Aj Lee broke. Also, Aj and Paige were friends and the tag team ""freaks and geeks"" together which makes Aj Lee calling her a ""freak"" during the match unbelievable.In general, the ending was over exagerated and lacked context. Paige didn't suck on the mic, Aj didn't legit smack her, Tamina was missing, they knew the outcome of the match, and Paige didn't say anything after she won. I'd highly recommend viewers to do some research on Aj Lee and the ending match. If there were to be a movie made on any wrestler it should be Aj Lee. Check out Crazy Is My Super Power by Aj Mendez for a legit wrestling story.So, thanks WWE for trying to make our Aj Lee just another pretty bimbo in this movie but despite your best efforts, it is still true that no one comes close to lacing up her Chuck Taylor's. We won't forget Aj Lee.",Fighting with My Family
