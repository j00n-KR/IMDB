0,nogodnomasters,What are you?,4,4 October 2021,"Henry Parsons (Logan Marshall-Green) is a successful architect and has build a large remote home for him and his wife Meera (Freida Pinto) a breast cancer survivor who doesn't where a pink ribbon. After they experience several break-ins, Meera begins to snoop around.I didn't like how the story went. Characters were weak and boring.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity.",Intrusion
1,kosmasp,Can see them/it coming,6,23 September 2021,"Yes if you have seen a thriller (or two or more), you probably will get where this movie is heading. So there won't be too many surprises story wise, but I like the actors (doing a great job). And even when I knew what this was going to be about, it was well told. Especially with another almost twist before the third act.So yeah this is quite flawed and predictable for many, but it is well made and edited. It lives off the actors and their charisma mostly - which is at least something I'd argue.",Intrusion
2,blanche-2,"It was an intrusion, all right",3,1 October 2021,"I did not realize this was a Netflix production, although God knows some of their movies have been dreadful. I actually thought it was one of those independent films that went straight to video.Intrusion had the look - I wish I could describe it - kind of antiseptic, where you suspect the house on the hill was placed there by a computer.A married couple, Meera and Henry Parsons (Frieda Pinto. Logan Marshall-Green, have moved from Boston to a small community I think in New Mexico, where they have built a large, beautiful home. It is in the middle of absolutely nowhere - we're talking desert. They have no alarm system. They have a generator outside that anyone can get to.After a break-in while the couple is out, the cops are called. The burglars didn't take much. Henry then gets an alarm and tracking devices for their phones. The next time the burglars enter the house, it's in the middle of the night when Henry and Meera are home asleep. Meera then finds out that Henry is hiding a gun in a plant, and he shoots all three people. Two die right away, one later.The police are concerned because the criminals have the last name of Cobb, and their sister has been missing for some time. They think the brothers are somehow involved.Meera starts snooping around, using the GPS in her husband's car, which leads her surprisingly to the Cobb's residence. There she breaks into their house and looks at their mail before she's caught and escorted out. It really takes some nerve to wander into someone's home, open their mailbox, and look around like you have all the time in the world.I won't go into the rest of the movie - it was a joke.I have seen maybe 6,000 movies in my life - maybe more. I've never seen anything as stupid as this. Maybe I have, but I blocked it out.Awful acting, awful dialogue, slow-moving. Flat atmosphere, awkward pauses. A mess.I was told that screenwriters, producers, etc., can't get an appointment to see anyone at Netflix even if they have a relative in an executive office. I also read it took ten years to get Queen's Gambit on the air.It's obvious Netflix has a need for product. It's a popular streaming service and they are behind many great shows. It would seem to me Netflix would seek out originality and excellence, whether it came from someone who knew the secret handshake or not.This film is an appalling insult.",Intrusion
3,searchanddestroy-1,Be sure the garbage collector doesn't leave it in the can...,1,23 September 2021,"Yes, be absolutely sure that, after the garbage truck came by, this nasty junk has been cleared out. Nasty, predictable ; so predictable and especially pulled by this unbearable music destined I guess, to terrify you. We have seen this scheme tons of times before and here, nothing new. Evil husband who slowly shows his real face. Netflix junk that we may find from time to time, we have to deal with it.",Intrusion
4,ops-52535,its nearly there...,5,22 September 2021,"But when it comes to making a great and spectacular overwhelming finale to it, they really fail dramaticaly. Its a small cast , man and woman, fleeing the big city to calmer and more isolated living, when things get strange after a breakin to their new house.The acting aint bad, neither the use of filmatographique techniques and really good use of sound effects to scare you up, and the ominous music that follows the plot does its workthe one to blaime is in my opinion the screenplay and storywriters, they give a caracter build up and makes a plot that is seriously loose and hidden in the drizzle, and the end sequence that should have had 20 more minutes of action, is made in a more or less lifetime sunday night tv drama fashion.But the grumpy old man knows that his spouce wouldve moved her nails by this kinda flicks so itll be a hit for some, and a small recommend comes in the end. Its just not fully developed.",Intrusion

7,TdSmth5,It worked for me,7,1 November 2021,"A couple moves into their recently built mansion out nowhere in New Mexico. The husband who is an architect designed and built it. One day they go on date night and leave their phones at home. The wife is a child psychologist who went through and recovered from breast cancer. She recently felt another lump. After they return they realize someone had broken in, made a mess, and stolen just the phones and a computer. So now the guy realizes he should install some type of security system. There is something wrong with the pipes too that keep making a noise occasionally.Another night, again someone breaks in while our couple is at home. The guy pulls out a gun hidden in a plant much to the outrage of the wife. While she tries to escape the guy ends up shooting all the 3 intruders. Police tell them the 3 were a family of known criminals, one of them survived and is in the hospital and also this family had a daughter go missing. One night when the husband goes to buy something in a store, forgets his wallet so the wife drives after him to try and catch up and notices he makes a turn away from the city...toward the hospital. She later is involved in a minor crash. So now, driving his car she notices an unknown address in the car's GPS and drives there. It's the trailer park where one the intruders lived. She finds an envelope with the logo of the husband's architectural firm as well as an envelope with a digital camera addressed to the police which she takes with her. On the damaged camera she sees the guy talking about someone staring at his daughter.She starts going through the husbands stuff in his office room and finds pictures during construction and it turns out the intruder guy worked on their house. The couple has been debating having a party for a while and eventually goes ahead with the housewarming party. At some point again she goes to the office and finds a hidden button that opens a hidden door and leads downstairs to a room. Eventually she has to confront the husband about what she finds there.Intrusion is a fairly minimalist movie about this couple and the secrets they harbor and their attempts to make the relationship work despite things that happened in the past, but then there are intrusions in the house that change everything. A movie like this could have been botched easily. I thought it might go the way of Trespass or the standard movie that takes place in one night and of course with the lights gone. But this movie is different. The setting in New Mexico is great, the mansion looks fantastic, I wish we would have gotten to see more if it, the cinematography is nice, and most of the movie takes place in daylight. Freida is of course easy on then eyes and that helps. Missing is a sense of dread and more involvement by the police. At the end the explanation of it all doesn't satisfy all that much. For everything to work out the script wants to, the characters have to take a lot of odd decisions. But overall, it's a short movie worth watching.",Intrusion
8,elliotjeory,Henry: Potrait of an architect,8,25 September 2021,"This is a decent thriller and I enjoyed it, it's suspenseful and has a solid production. The husband gives an excellent and often unintentionally funny performance as a psychotic architect. Overall an above average film from Netflix.",Intrusion
9,Luigi Di Pilla,Average psycho thriller,5,24 September 2021,Actually Intrusion is ranked third on Netflix. So me and my wife tried to watch it. The critics here are so negative but you have to make your own opinion. Then we saw the thriller and we thought it must not be so bad as written in the reviews.Finally we spent surprisingly an entertaining evening. It's a solid psycho thriller.The main actors did a good job. The atmosphere and the landscapes were creepy done. The story was not boring and this is why we give an average of 5.5 out 10.,Intrusion
10,btreakle,Thriller indeed,8,11 October 2021,"Personally, I loved this film. Sure easy to predict but none the less enjoyable.Highly recommend this film to anyone who likes thriller movies.",Intrusion
11,gianmarcoronconi,Banal,5,15 October 2021,"This film is very banal for its plot and tries in vain not to be by offering you plot twists that are very predictable, you understand from the beginning who is the real villain and even if the film tries to mislead you it fails. Apart from that, however, the film manages to maintain a good atmosphere of tension.",Intrusion
12,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Poorly written thriller.,2,25 September 2021,Poorly written thriller. Heavy-handed foreboding by lead detective ala Colombo. Antagonist with slick back hair that yells out I'm a bad guy. No red herrings no diversions no mystery and comical cliches of keeping a young defense girl locked up in the basement. The sisterhood against the patriarchy male. Made for over-the-air TV detective thriller template with filling in the blanks characters names. Is there any creativity left in Wokeywood? Do they even know how to write a mystery thriller anymore?,Intrusion
13,nathanmanson,Completely caught me off guard,7,29 September 2021,"As my header says it did completely catch me off guard. I was expecting just a standard home invasion thriller that you see a lot of, but it wasn't that at all. When the the home invasion happened so soon into the film it confused me how the film was going to go. I'm seeing a lot of bad reviews and people saying it was too predictable but that is complete lies. Unless they can see into the future there's no way they predicted how the film would go. In my opinion it's a really good thriller where you're on the edge of your seat and with quite a lot of jump scares, if that's your thing you will love it. Don't believe the bad reviews and give it a chance.",Intrusion
14,apryla-58795,"Pinto, Marshall-Green and the house are very good looking but...",7,25 September 2021,Aesthetically beautiful but content has been used too much. You can figure out what's going on pretty quickly. I'm sorry but there's no way you couldn't know your husband is half a bubble off. I don't know about anybody else but my husband and I share everything with one another I would think it weird if we didn't...you're gonna tell me he built this whole house and not once did she do a walk-through and see this hidden room?! Not possible. Also she goes into this trailer park completely sticking out like a sore thumb and breaks into a trailer undetected? What exactly is the deal with this guy? Has he done this before? How he gonna act one way all this time and then do a 360 halfway through. Also we never found out if HE killed that guy in the hospital. Highly unlikely he'd be able to do that yet that's what they were implying. And then it ends with her looking at the house and driving away. Original. Not. This could have been so good but it turned out to be a dud. LMG is hot though so it wasn't a complete waste.,Intrusion
15,johannes2000-1,"Potentially good premise, but total lack of realism and logic.",4,30 September 2021,"There's not so much wrong with the premise, which could have made for a reasonably entertaining thriller. But as to realism and logic, there's really a whole lot amiss!Why should a couple want to live in a newly built house in the middle of a totally barren and isolated nowhere, apparently at first without even the remotest safety-precautions? Why this complicated healed-from-cancer background, that doesn't add anything to the story? How come this highly intelligent wife (a psychologist no less) doesn't have any idea of their financial situation or the way they financed this house? And then letting her drive alone to a trailer-park that apparently is notorious for its criminality, and there break into a home and steal mail out-of a mailbox, committing one felony after another?! Or letting her impulsively follow a hunch (one that I personally failed to grasp, but that's probably my simple brain), and go look for hidden rooms in the middle of a housewarming party and right under the nose of the one person that she suspects?! (I mean, why not wait till the next day when he's gone out?). I could go on like this, it's one stupid decision after another!After the final showdown we get a totally superfluous epilogue scene, making the movie go out with a puff. Well, it suits the whole project.",Intrusion
16,mmthos,PARDON THE INTRUSION,5,26 September 2021,"This starts out as an original twist on a home invasion theme and effectively keeps up the ""Did he--Didn't he?"" till the Big Reveal when it instantly turns into a comic romp to an appropriately wacky endingfun enough to waste time on.",Intrusion
17,Draysan-Jennings,Predictable but watchable,6,23 September 2021,"I got the creeper vibe instantly from the husband. You could tell something was sketchy about him right off the bat. Good actor. I remember him from The Invitation. The story was fairly predictable but I definitely didn't expect him to have the girl tied up in a hidden basement. I can understand why some people don't like this film. But a 1 star rating? Lol come on, it wasn't that bad.",Intrusion
18,MovieCriticOnline,Another unoriginal movie,1,28 September 2021,"It starting interesting but quickly began to fall apart.Here there was clearly something off with the husband from the get-go. It was so obvious he was up to no good. I just wished the director didn't make it so obvious. So this fragile shaken-up woman decided to become a detective and go on a fool's errand putting herself into dangerous situations. PLEASE make stuff believable. She of course has to play the worst liar ever even when she clearly got caught lying. She couldn't even answer a straight question and then expected him to believe her? What? This film was ridiculous.The worst part is he just let it go, despite her clearly lying. I hate directors that tell their actors to look guilty when they are supposed to hide their guilt. And of course Pinto couldn't wait until her husband left the house before rummaging his office. It was ridiculous.I HATE movies where characters are written to make one dumb decision after the other. How many movies have we seen about a couple where the husband has a dark secret and sinister past? They are endless and unfortunately, this didn't bring anything new. The dramatic music sure didn't help. I just didn't care about anyone and quite frankly I found Pinto annoying.The plot was frivolous and the end unnecessary. The direction they took it in was annoying. The film didn't know if it was remaking Sleeping with the Enemy or the Girl With The Dragon Tatoo.This movie was just unbearable. It's a copycat of the 100s of other similar movies like this. NOTHING new, like ZERO. SKIP THIS! Hell to the Naw ah!!",Intrusion
19,gab-67599,I Liked It,7,27 September 2021,"Even though I could definitely guess he was the killer. His underground room was a bit of a shock. Nicely done because the main guy gave off a REAL serial killer vibe and it made for a simple thriller. The wife was beautiful, just wish they would have told more about her. I honestly thought he stuck around because she had a drug problem until he said cancer at the end. This felt like a knock off version of Inheritance, but less interesting. I loved the movie Inheritance! I recommend this movie if you like good mysteries, because I do feel like this story (Although done before) was very interesting solely due to good actors.",Intrusion
20,drpainters,Very predictable,6,10 October 2021,"Very predictable but still kind of entertaining. If you've got nothing to watch and want a few scares without much blood, give it a try. Not something you'd watch more then once.",Intrusion
21,Just-A-Girl-14,What's with the bad reviews??,7,23 September 2021,"Why are people always looking for something fresh and original? Ok, so it's not an Oscar winner but it's a decent thriller. So what if it's predictable? So what if it's been done before? Not every movie can be the next big thing. With the amount of crapy movies out there (and I mean real crap) it's just not that bad! Definitely doesn't deserve such low ratings! I enjoyed it. It was fine. Decent acting, good pace and an interesting (even if predictable) storyline. Yes, it's been done before but so what? If you're looking for the next big thing, don't watch it but if you want to kill an hour and a half and watch a decent thriller, give it a try.",Intrusion
22,Mehki_Girl,Annoying,5,26 September 2021,"This is one of those movies where people make stupid mistakes/decisions and you find yourself screaming at the TV - stab him until his dead, pick up the knife, don't drop the gun, close/lock the door, wait until he's not home, take the damned bat, hurry up!You get the picture.We've all been there.Oh, and the house was ugly AF.",Intrusion
23,whitemanfromtowne,A trailer of bad acting.....super hard pass.,1,24 September 2021,"You can just tell by the trailer that some actors have absolutely no experience in the film industry and just after watching the trailer of bad acting, it's a super hard pass for me.",Intrusion
24,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,4,26 September 2021,"Good Morrow, countrymen.This isn't a ""home invasion movie."" If you're signing up for that...this isn't it.It's a luke warm, ""The guy you married isn't who you think he is,"" flick.Another cheap version of sleeping with the enemy. Not a bad thing...but this film suffers from telegraphing the twist so egregiously - you see it a mile away. We know almost immediately that the seemingly cultured and doting husband is a psycho - if we can see it, how did the wife miss it? The other major issue is the unbelievably horrible acting from Freida Pinto (as Meera). It's bad to the point of distracting.Finally, the motivation for the husband being a psycho isn't explained to satisfaction. The entire plot is absurd...to do what he did without anyone noticing is ridiculous....with that, it was watchable - but forgettable.Fare thee well. It's hoecakes and Madeira time!",Intrusion
25,msunando,When danger is closer than what you think,5,20 October 2021,"Meera (Freida Pinto) and her husband Henry Parsons (Logan Marshall-Green), married for 12 years have recently shifted to a beautiful, spacious designer home crafted by the latter in a quiet place called Coralles, in New Mexico from Boston. Meera has had her share of suffering and is a beast cancer survivor, grateful to Henry for supporting her through her trauma. They are planning a housewarming party, when suddenly one evening, when returning from a dinner, they discover a break-in at their place. Traumatised, Meera feels insecure in the isolated house, and things take a turn for the worse when one night, when they are asleep, three men break into their house and appear to be searching for something. A violent confrontation of the intruders with Henry follows, and Meera is further horrified to discover that Henry is in possession of a gun, and the face off concludes with two of the intruders being shot dead, and the third fatally injured.It is a streak in Henry that Meera hasn't known of in all these years, and within a couple of days, Henry is talking about the housewarming party again, to her utter surprise. It's as if she has barely known this man. Her fears about something not being right crystallize as the third intruder, who was recovering from his wounds in the ICU, suddenly dies and the local police chief tells her that the intruders were all from a single family (Cobb), and a young girl Christine from the family has been missing for some time now. Meera begins to snoop around the Cobb family dwelling on the other side of the town and what she discovers could change her life forever.""Intrusion"", directed by Adam Salky is an average thriller, with too many loose ends to address. Why did Henry choose to build a designer home in the middle of nowhere, or where he had hidden his violent streak behind the calm exterior for twelve long years of marriage are questions that go begging for an answer. Also, for Meera to be investigating the subject and landing up with crucial clues from the Cobb home with no formal investigation experience is laudable, but rather unbelievable. Why the local police didn't follow through also remains unexplained. Having said that, both Freida Pinto and Logan Marshall-Green give credible performances and the ominous music scored by Alex Heffes make ""Intrusion"" watchable.",Intrusion

28,leesimon-26357,Not as completely predictable as people say,7,11 October 2021,"The reviews that say they predicted this in the first 5 minutes are liars, as the characters haven't all even been introduced at that point. Now 30 minutes in, sure. You pretty much know what's up. However, the motives are a new twist rarely seen before. ""I decide when"" is very, very chilling.The acting isn't terrible, and the sets are definitely amazing. Neflix sure does love its rotating shots, which was a little lame, and they definitely went full cheese-ball for the ending. But not less than 5 stars for sure. It's tense, and a little thrilling throughout.I probably won't see it again though. It's pretty 'bleh' once you know for sure what's going on.",Intrusion

It's clear that some Netflix originals are nothing but movies that nobody wanted to pick up for distribution or even for streaming which Netflix does at cheap prices. Frida Pinto does an excellent job as the main lead, cinematographer does his best but nothing can save the bad story, script and the predictive outcome.

33,OneAnjel,"Decent storyline, lacks hutzpah",5,11 November 2021,"The premise of this film is actually good, although not novel. The filmography was decent, the sound and music were good. But the character of Meera lacked emotion and I was surprised to see Freida Pinto is actually not that new to the film industry. She began as a model in India and, honestly, looks more like she thinks she's still modeling here. There seems to be almost no lead-up to the level of distrust the audience is shown after a few vague clues. I felt there should have been something more clever about how we are to associate with what Meera is going through. It felt almost sterile. Yet after her sudden and intense suspicion, Henry is able to allay her concerns with an obviously deceptive story and they go about making plans for the big housewarming. This could have been a much better film but it was not a bad watch as is. To everyone saying what a great house it is -- I'm sorry, but that has to be one of the most bleak structures I've ever seen. Looks like the headquarter building for a prison, at least from the outside. The director had wanted to set this film in the woods using a cabin in an eastern state but couldn't do so because of the Covid plandemic. I think this house actually worked better. Also, this film was made using social distancing and the gambit, so that might explain some of the odd situational shots and lack of human interaction. In that sense, they pulled it off pretty well.",Intrusion

I just couldn't get into it, so I found myself on my phone, cooking and basically anything other than focus on this film.It doesn't engage you whatsoever in the beginning or even the middle, skip to the last 25 mins and that will save you time.I know we are in a pandemic so we have to deal with whatever films are released, and they can't have as many people in them but this was a snore fest.Ok so the nutshell is Meera and her husband move into a new home which he built. It's an incredible home in a secluded location.He seems creepy and controlling, she's a psychologist she had cancer and is infertile. I only realised this at the end as there really wasn't any character development.I have no idea if he was a contract killer or if he just liked killing and who the girl was in the basement that Meera discovers.

I thought the set design was great, the cinematography was fun and dynamic.Logan Marshall Green plays a bit of a clichéd character, but I have to say, this might be his best performance yet.It's just a good looking movie that sort of elevates what is otherwise predictable plot. I also think the movie is pretty fun and entertaining, it's the sort of light watch that's perfect for a family party, you know? (Which may say more about how we're desensitized violence, but whatever) And um...hey, it's always great to see Freida Pinto, right?The Bad: Unfortunately, this movie's big twist is about as obvious as it gets. I don't know anyone who would be shocked by how things turn out, even if it comes from left field. This trope has been beaten to death at this point. I would have actually appreciated more quiet moments with double meanings to rope us in a little more.The Ugly: Is it just me, or is the glut of movies set in desolate locations with small casts increasing lately? (I wouldn't doubt it given the pandemic) We've just seen this movie before. It's nothing special, but it's not that bad either. Even my Mom who recommended it spoke volumes when she left the room to watch something else, despite ""liking the movie."" I think that sort of sums it up.

They have moved to a small town into an extravagant modern house that he himself designed. This movie shows similarities with ""The Night House"". Meera's sifting is the most enjoyable element of the film, as we play detective along with her, ransacking through drawers and asking questions she perhaps doesn't want answered. Where Meera ends up is no great surprise but it's a twist that takes the film to a nasty place.What struck me immediately is the lack of chemistry between the ""handsome couple"". The acting is not that bad, it just does not feel right. A bit forced acting and their characters are not aligned with the story and the plot. There is a gorgeous house, stunning scenery but also a very predictable ending. At the end, you don´t care about the plot. You just want to get to the end of the movie before falling asleep.

Additionally the two main characters were just oddly cast. They didn't mesh well together.Before the film was halfway through it was predictable. I predicted the plot 100% so that was kind of disappointing.

It's not trying to fool you because it's not a psychological thriller. Its just simply made to entertain, like all movies. This is another movie wrongfully rated on IMDB. It's meant to be a realistic thriller about people who have a hidden dark side, but can play so normal in society. I love how straight to the point this is.

166,jonasmarkussen,Mark my words: Logan Marshall-Green is going to be A-list!,7,22 September 2021,"Yes Netflix finally a well done entertaining thriller from you! After I couldn't sit through Sweet Girl from earlier this year I was happy to see that they kind of redeemed themselves with this production.I saw it without knowing nothing about it or reading any reviews. Therefore I thought it was a straight up home invasion thriller which I like, but I quickly discovered it was more of a standard thriller. And it's good fun.There are not a lot of reviews at the current moment, but I've seen two just calling this movie trash, one without presenting any arguments to why he or she found it to be that bad, and the other because it was 'predictable'.. Does that necessarily make a movie bad? Because I don't think so. Yes, it maybe is a little predictable but not AS predictable as some make it out to be. And I really don't think this movie set out to be groundbreaking in the thriller genre. I'd rather see a well produced and well acted thriller, that's not trying to break new grounds in the genre but is just a good and suspenseful ride, that a pretentious thriller that wants to be something that it is not with a complete confusing story line and bad actors. Intrusion maybe does not add anything new to the genre, but that seems to be the case of a lot of movies, and still it is just a fine thriller, and I didn't expect anything else.This is not a masterpiece, but it is perfect as Sunday night entertainment. Freida Pinto is great as Meera, our protagonist but Logan Marshall-Green steals the show as Henry. It's kind of a cliché but by doing a little he's doing a lot. I really liked him in this one! He is far from a-list material yet, but having delivered so many solid performances in movies like The Invitation and Upgrade and now this one I believe he will get a lot more roles in way bigger productions made for the big screen in a few years!The rest of the cast unfortunately isn't that great, and especially Detective Morse, portrayed by Robert John Burke is bland and really doesn't add anything to the story. But again the movie really centers mainly around the married couple so I was okay with that. Then there was a really forced scene that was there only to drive the plot forward, where Meera is watching the news at home while hosting a party that I found quite unbelievable. It's a little thing I know, but who turns on the news when they are having a big house party, when there's no particular reason for it? It was to obvious that the writers needed that. At last I didn't find the ending to be as exciting as I hoped for. It's not a big disappointment and there wasn't a lot of ways it could've ended, but it could've been done a little better.So not a masterpiece but very entertaining and it ranks high amongst the recent Netflix Originals, although that's not saying a lot. If you are in it for a well done thriller to spend an hour and a half, I think you will find it fitting for just that. Either way, I think giving this movie a 1-star rating is just ridiculous..I use to comment on the bad tendencies among a lot of reviewers here where they give 1 star to ok movies. It's very misleading and I think IMDb should have a bigger filter for taking out reviews that are not presenting any arguments besides ""it's trash"". When people go to the site for guidance towards good movies and the first they see is for a movie like this are three reviews giving this a 1-star rating without arguments they might miss out and thats a shame.Intrusion is probably around 6.5 if you ask me.

So she opens up a location tracking app that is later revealed they both know they have it, and then the husband wants to know why ere she was across town, after just taking about the app.Bear in mind the film is quite short, this entire plot line is completely pointless and irrelevant because of the damn tracking appIf you're after a twist, there isn't one. The entire plot of the film is predictable from the first 10 minutes. The only shock of the film was that our prediction was actually correct and it's just that bad.",Intrusion

Sadly though, a lot of the suspense is caused by the characters making nonsensical/borderline stupid decisions when they find themselves in dangerous situations. From the very beginning, you'll have a suspicion about what is going on, and sadly, everything is exactly as it appears and as such there's little to no surprise or intrigue throughout.

But there is no hint why he could have done everything he did until he says it to his wife at the end, no development, plot holes, bad story!I think the 5.1 rating is a little high. But it's not a 1 as many others rated it, I give it a 3-3.5 mainly for Freida Pinto's performance, very good acting even if her character seems to find every clue easily one after the other but it's not Freida's fault. Logan Marshall-Green and Robert John Burke's performances are over the top but it has always been that way, especially LMG who may be a good looking man but that's all he has, he is simply not a good actor!If you are a die-hard LMG fan, maybe you'll enjoy it but if not, save yourself the trouble and watch something else!",Intrusion

267,sewalker-12265,Decent flick,6,1 October 2021,"Not sure why such poor ratings.. This was a decent flick. The plot was predictable, the guy was creepy from the beginning so it was a little unbelievable they would be married 12 years and now this just pops up... But overall movie kept you entertained throughout.",Intrusion
