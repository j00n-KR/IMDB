0,Leofwine_draca,"Adequate, but where's the love?",6,26 September 2020,"HELLBOY is the third instalment of the filmed comic book franchise, sadly lacking the magnificent presence of director Guillermo del Toro who is replaced by likeable B-movie stalwart Neil Marshall. Unfortunately Marshall didn't contribute the script, which is undoubtedly the weakest thing about this generic offering, and despite copious amounts of his trademark gore and bloodshed, this is a film that doesn't amount to much. Ron Perlman didn't come back either, and David Harbour is a weak imitation, his Hellboy lacking singularly in charisma and feeling more like a heavy metal band member more than anything else. The film offers endless spectacle and action heavily dominated by CGI effects, but the mish-mash of plot and forced humour, while watchable, doesn't have the same love and care that went into the two prior films. Put it this way: I can happily re-watch either of those, but I won't be re-watching this one.",Hellboy
1,SnoopyStyle,no longer fun,4,5 July 2019,"During the time of Camelot, King Arthur dismembers the evil Nimue (Milla Jovovich) and his knights carry the remains to far off hiding places. In the present day, Hellboy (David Harbour) is battling evil under the command of his adoptive father Trevor Bruttenholm (Ian McShane). Alice Monaghan (Sasha Lane) is a close companion on the team who has clairvoyant powers. Team member Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim) distrusts Hellboy and takes mysterious injections.All the fun seems to have been drained from the franchise. Everyone is playing a singular tone of sarcasm and anger. There is plenty of splatter as the movie seems to be leaning towards the horror genre. It's not horror in terms of being scary. It's horror in terms of having some of the visual language without the effects. The story telling is rather flat. I expected this to be a scavenger hunt for the parts of Nimue but that's not the case. It becomes a series of events and battles with sound and fury signifying nothing.",Hellboy
2,Prismark10,Back into hell,3,2 August 2019,"In hindsight they should had just made a Hellboy 3. It does not help that the director of the first two films, Guillermo del Toro ends up being an Oscar winning director.With del Toro so lauded, director Neil Marshall of this rebooted film was in a hiding to nothing.Hellboy (David Harbour) is still battling demons of the paranormal. In fact we see him wrestle at the start with a missing agent who has been taking over by vampires. His adoptive father Trevor (Ian McShane) sends him on to various deadly missions such as taking on giants. However as the spawn of satan, not many people trust Hellboy.Hellboy battles evil blood queen Nimue (Milla Jovovich) whose body was dismembered by King Arthur in Pendle Hill during the dark ages. Now she has been resurrected and she plans to unleash hell with Hellboy by her side.The film is rendered dull by the lack of action sequences and some subpar special effects. It is only during the action scenes when the film springs to life. The humour is not as cutting and it all just looks like a bit of a mess.",Hellboy
3,nogodnomasters,Beware the Jabberwock,8,2 May 2019,"Hellboy (David Harbour) is part of BPRD, Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense. He is battling vampires in Mexico when we catch up to him. His history and lineage are related later. In the opening scene, Nimue, the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) is dismembered by King Arthur in 517 AD which technically the 6th century and not the 5th century as mentioned in the film. It isn't hard to figure out how these two subplots come together.I loved the fantasy characters which reminded me of epic films such as Potter and LOTR. Great music, fights, and swagger. Hellboy cracks jokes all the time which he claims is therapy. Could be a sequel too. I liked the core characters. A teen film with adult language.Guide: F-word. No sex. Brief partial nudity.",Hellboy
4,kosmasp,Hell did not freeze over,7,8 July 2019,"Even though some critics thought it might. Now this had a bad standing from the beginning. And while the actors are quite nice and the R-rating was secured (something fan boys really wished for), it did not make nearly as much money as it was supposed to. Or rather as much as the producers and the studio hoped for overall.And while this is layed out to warrant sequels, this probably won't happen. And it's almost a shame, because it isn't at all bad. The effects are good, the new Hellboy managed to stay afloat (which is quite an achievement if you think about the shoes he had to fill - or is it the horns?) - the story made sense too. But I guess there is a comic book fatigue to a degree. There are so many movies out there, that people pick and choose. Maybe there were other reasons too, but in the end it doesn't really matter ... speaking of endings: there is one mid credit scene and one after credit scene. So if you watch it, watch it proper",Hellboy
5,classicsoncall,"""Ridding the world of evil is a dirty business.""",7,1 October 2019,"I wasn't familiar with actor David Harbour, and so, didn't know if he'd be able to fill the capable shoes of Ron Perlman from the original film and it's sequel. Turns out he did a pretty good job and seemed to capture the essence of the comic book character created by Mike Mignola quite well. Story wise though, I couldn't help feeling it wasn't much more than any other flick dabbling in vampire lore, Arthurian legend and a lot of good old fashioned gore. The gore by the way, isn't suitable for very young kids, as there's a fairly extended sequence with various forms of dismemberment that might prove vomit inducing. I thought I was paying attention pretty well when in a particular scene, Major Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim) appeared to be positioning himself for a major double cross against Hellboy, but then it never happened. That was a rather odd lapse in continuity. Amid all the carnage and mayhem, I got a particular chuckle out of the scene where Hellboy goes up against Vivienne Nimue the Blood Queen and shoots her eye out, an inadvertent reminder of what Ralphie's mom always admonished him for while using his Red Ryder BB-gun in 1983's ""A Christmas Story"". If you watch enough movies, you'll frequently come away with odd associations like that. Be that as it may, the picture seems to have some degree of difficulty in gaining the right foothold in a particular genre, dabbling in horror, vampirism, historical legend, and occultism in the British tradition. It's a lot to ask for, even for the world's greatest paranormal investigator.",Hellboy
6,ma-cortes,Third version based on Mike Mignola's cult comicbook creation professionally directed by Neil Marshall,6,22 December 2019,"A new remake made with nice panache based on the known comicbook , here the central figure is a grouchy, ironical, gun-toting half-human devil with a giant right arm and woman problems, being caught up between the worlds of the human race and supernatural . A thinking person's creature graced with incredible force and irony. Hellboy : David Balfour, is son of a fallen angel who came to our world in 1944 as a result of a mythical and magical ritual presided by Rasputin, the famous Russian monk . As our bouncing friend crawled into this world from another dimension during WWII. As the occultists of the third Reich invoked the demon from the hell, but then he fell into the claws of the American military. As Hellboy began to serve them by protecting the world from horrible and weird threats. Heartful horror is Neil Marshall's stock in trade with lots of noisy action, battles, thrills, chills and abundant special effects. There Hellboy is assigned to a dangerous mission, being sent to Great Bretain and fighting an eternal evil that currently manifiests itself in the form of Merlin's wife, Nimue : Milla Jovovich .As Hellboy meets face to face the heinous magician woman carrying out a lethal confrontation. Along the way Hellboy is supported by other colleagues from the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense and friends, such as Alice Monaghan : Sasha Lane, Major Ben Daimio : Daniel Dae Kim, Lady Hatton : Sophie Okanedo and his doctor, adopted father Ian McShane .As they battle an ominous witch who awakes from ancient times.Stars David Harbour as Hellboy whose interpretation is similar the former ones played by Ron Perlman. David plays him as an anti-hero, a blue-collar guy, happier eating and joking that fighting evil. This wisecracking, cigar-chomping hunk role results to be a crossover among Humphrey Bogart, Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood. The film rips through an opening prologue explaining his origin. Relishing absurdities and incoherences, filmmaker get on with the business of fast and furious amusement, racking up sequences with breathtaking set pieces against elaborate, urban-occult backdrops. This is third retelling , former ones directed by Guillermo del Toro : ""Hellboy"" 2004 with Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, John Hurt, Karl Roden, Rupert Evans, Jeffrey Tambor, Doug Jones and ""Hellboy, The Golden Army"" 2008 with Perlman, Selma Blair, Luke Goss, James Dodd, John Alexander , Seth McFarlane.Director Marshall fuses the fabulous imagination by means of several monsters and the irreverent wit and comicbook action of Hellboy. As this great red-skinned, trenchcoated hero is pitched into a class between adopted human world and an underworld of trolls, fairies, witches and all of them fighting againt a giant warhog, and a witch bent on vengeance .There is also a heartful plea for bio and cultural diversity.It contains a colorful and glimmer cinematography by Lorenzo Senatore. As well as moving and thrilling musical score by Benjamin Wallfisch. The motion picture produced by Milennium Films was well directed by Neil Marshall, though it has some flaws and gaps, being justly inferior to two previous renditions. Marshall is good Brit craftsman, expert on action, sci-fi and terror movies as Dog soldiers, The descent, Doomsday, Tales of Halloween, The reckoning. And he has directed episodes of notorious series as Constantine, Game of thrones, Timeless, Hannibal, Westworld, Lost in space. Rating 5.5/10. Passable and acceptable recounting.",Hellboy
7,BA_Harrison,Neither a complete disaster nor a triumph.,5,23 August 2019,"517 A.D.: King Arthur defeats the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) with the help of his trusty magical sword Excalibur, chopping her into pieces and burying her still-living body parts in the far reaches of the land. 1500 years later, changeling Gruagach (voiced by Stephen Graham) pieces the queen back together so that she can destroy mankind and rule the Earth with monsters as her loyal subjects. Hellboy (David Harbour) is given the job of preventing this from happening.The majority of fans and critics gave this film hell on its release. So what did it do to deserve such damnation?For many, the simple fact that it wasn't directed by Guillermo Del Toro and didn't star Ron Perlman was enough to demonise the movie, but even overlooking the change of director and leading man, there is still plenty to dislike: the creature-filled action scenes are over-reliant on unrealistic CGI; the comedy frequently mis-fires; Daniel Dae Kim and Sasha Lane are lousy as Hellboy's sidekicks; and the plot is rather scattershot. Oh, and there's a REALLY bad ectoplasmic Ian McShane.Having said that, there is also quite a lot to enjoy: the R-Rating allows for plenty of graphic gore (although, sadly, much of it is also digital); there are some delightfully absurd moments (Hellboy's encounter with hideous witch Baba Yaga, who lives in a house on giant chicken legs, is excellent, and Eastenders fans will enjoy seeing Mo Harris brandishing a machine gun); the links to Arthurian legend are fun, and apparently make the film more faithful to the comics than Del Toro's movies; and director Neil Marshall occasionally shows us what he is really capable of (the single-shot fight scene in a Siberian complex at the end of the film is wonderful).All in all, a very mixed bag of a movie: not the completely hellish experience that I had heard it was, but far from great.",Hellboy
8,paul_haakonsen,"As enjoyable as the 2004 Guillermo del Toro ""Hellboy"" movie...",8,4 July 2019,"Alright, well given the grief there has been from the internet trolls about this 2019 ""Hellboy"" movie, I was a little bit concerned. But still, I sat down to watch the 2019 ""Hellboy"" from director Neil Marshall.And I will say that the 2019 movie is equally on the same level of enjoyment and entertainment as the 2004 ""Hellboy"" movie from director Guillermo del Toro.The storyline in the 2019 was quite enjoyable and felt very much at home in the ""Hellboy"" universe. So I was definitely entertained from beginning and up to the very end of the movie.The special effects were great, and of course for a movie such as this, special effects and CGI are a definitive factor that adds lots to the movie. Thankfully they had a great CGI crew working for them, and it showed on the screen. Lots of spectacular effects and great - and realistic looking - creature designs and concepts.Lot of the grief from the internet trolls - the same people that probably cried about ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" and ""Captain Marvel"" - was so dumb and had nothing to build their moaning on. Sure, Ron Perlman wasn't in the movie. But Ron Perlman doesn't define whom the Hellboy character is, by no means. Sure, Ron Perlman was good in the role, but I will say that David Harbour was every bit as good as portraying the character, and he was a great cast choice for the role. So a massive oversized stone thumbs up from me to David Harbour for his performance in this movie.Aside from David Harbour, then the movie boasted a pretty impressive cast list. Milla Jovovich is somewhat of an acquired taste for me, as I like her a lot in some movies, but not so much in other movies. But she was so perfectly cast for the villainous role of Nimue / The Blood Queen in this movie, and she added a lot of flavor to the movie. The movie also had Ian McShane on the cast list, and wow. Just wow. This guy makes everything he is in impressive and worthwhile watching. Daniel Dae Kim was also quite good in his given role in the movie.If you enjoyed the previous ""Hellboy"" movies or the comics, then you definitely will also like the 2019 movie, that is for certain.Hellboy is back to claim the throne, and David Harbour proves that he carried the mantle of Hell quite well.",Hellboy
9,BandSAboutMovies,Woof,3,1 March 2020,"I wanted in my heart of hearts to love this movie. I mean, it starts with a Spanish-language version of ""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" while the titular Hellboy battles a lucha libre vampire. That bloodsucker turns out to be Esteban Ruiz, an agent for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. His last words are a prophecy of the end of the world, as related to the Blood Queen Vivienne Nimue (Milla Jovovich), the mother of all monsters, who was once destroyed and vivisected all over England by King Arthur.So why did I feel like I ate dollar store candy - a lot of dollar store candy - and now feel kind of woozy?Because this movie follows the two Guillermo del Toro Hellboy films. And those movies? The finest chocolate you've ever tasted. And I'll admit it. I was prejudiced against this movie the moment that del Toro's role was diminished and then he walked away.After that mission, Hellboy's father - B.P.R.D. leader Trevor Bruttenholm (Ian McShane) - asks his adopted son to assist the Osiris Club as they hunt three giants. This is when we learn that Hellboy came to our world as the result of a Nazi experiment, but instead of killing him, Bruttenholm decided to raise him.Meanwhile, a pig fairy named Gruagach and the witch Baba Yaga - no relation to the Italian bonkers 1970's film outside of name and cultural origin - are gathering the pieces of Nimue. And oh yeah - those hunters decided to kill Hellboy because they also feel like he's going to cause the end of the world.Luckily, Hellboy gets back on his feet and fights the giants until he's saved by Alice Monaghan, a witch who he saved from fairies - including the pig man, which is why he hates our hero - when she was a child. There's a flashback and at this point, if you've read the Hellboy comics, you're either up to speed, upset with deviances in the movie or you haven't read them and are utterly lost. Or perhaps you're drunk and just enjoying the gore, as I enjoyed this film with a huge buffet of cheladas at 7 AM.There's also M11 agent Ben Daimio, who has a special bullet that can kill Hellboy, just in case he's taken in by Nimue, who comes back to life and starts a plague that spreads throughout England.Oh yeah - somehow Hellboy is the Anung un Rama, the literal heir of Arthur through his mother, who is now trapped in Hell by his father. He can carry Excaibur but refuses to, assured that it will lead to the end of the world.So - the good: I liked David Harbour in this. He seems like a decent guy and goes all in on his roles. He was frustrated by the failure of this movie, saying, ""We did our best, but there's so many voices that go into these things and they're not always going to work out. I did what I could do and I feel proud of what I did, but ultimately I'm not in control of a lot of those things.""Speaking of all those voices, Hellboy creator Mike Mignola bowed out early, missing the behind the scenes feuding between director Neil Marshall (The Descent, Dog Soldiers) and producers Lawrence Gordon and Lloyd Levin, who went so far as to interrupt the director in front of the cast and crew during rehearsals to give his own direction to them. The production team also fired Sam McCurdy, Marhsall's cinematographer. This was to send a message - note the word allegedly should be that, as Levin's lawyer has decried these claims - to the director that he was not really in charge.I also loved seeing Thomas Haden Church as Lobster Johnson and the Abe Sapian cameo at the end. It's not a perfect movie - far from it, it has a very inconsistent tone - but I wasn't bored. And hey - the actors, particularly Jovovich, seemed to be having a blast. Maybe it didn't make back its $50 million dollar budget, but it got close.For her part, Jovovich would say that her ""raddest films have been slammed by critics"" and argued that this would become a cult classic. I mean, who are we to deny the star of Ultraviolet?",Hellboy
10,bevo-13678,Eh?,10,8 November 2020,I saw the movie hellboy and it was pretty good. But I think it might have been th other one,Hellboy
11,CinemaSerf,Hell-ish Boy...,3,15 November 2019,"Where do I start? Not since Derek Jarman at his most outlandish, have I seen so many people leave a screening mid-film. With Jarman that was almost certainly because his style of film-making and storytelling had a profoundly polarising effect; not so here - it was purely, and simply, because the film is terrible. I have always struggled to quite get why Ian McShane (a bit like Clive Owen) gets film roles - he always comes across as ""Lovejoy"" what ever the part is. Harbour and Javovich bring nothing to the party, either. I think this is my turkey of the year (and possibly last year, too). It would have to be an exceedingly long flight before I would recommend anyone go near this dross - and make sure you drink the bar dry, first!",Hellboy
12,zardoz-13,An Unforgettable Reboot of a Classic Demon Parody,9,3 May 2019,"British director Neil Marshall, who helmed three dazzling adventure epics: ""The Descent"" (2005), ""Doomsday"" (2008), and ""Centurion"" (2010), has given the character of ""Hellboy"" a new lease on life in a second sequel. Unfortunately, events haven't augured well for a third sequel. Released by Lionsgate, ""Hellboy"" (2019) stayed in circulation for about 35 days on fewer than 3,300 screens, so some die-hard fans might have missed it for whatever reason. Reportedly, ""Hellboy"" coined $21 million theatrically, while overseas exhibition fell shy of $19 million, against a $50 million budget. No, ""Hellboy"" didn't recoup its budget! Presumably, home video sales may allow Lionsgate to break even. Despite its lackluster box office, """"Hellboy"" ranks as an outlandish but bloodthirsty sword & sorcery spectacle teeming with supernatural atrocities awash in blood, gore and splatter. Ironically, ""Hellboy"" budget tallied not only $16 million less than the 2004 original, but it also came up $35 million shy of the 2008 sequel! Clearly, CGI costs have declined, when you consider the larger-than-life, wholesale slaughter fest raging between mankind and monsters. Mind you, if you're a snowflake, think twice about seeing ""Hellboy."" If you didn't flinch at the PG-13 rated dinosaur versus man antics in the ""Jurassic World"" franchise, nothing here should flabbergast you. The creepy villainess Baba Yaga reminded me of Reagan MacNeil, the possessed teenage girl in ""The Exorcist."" Ultimately, ""Hellboy"" doesn't try to horrify as much as sicken you with its CGI splatter. Indeed, body parts are casually hacked away amid fountains of gushing blood. Two airborne demons holding a man by his head and feet tear him apart, and the poor fellow bursts open like a jelly roll. Doing nothing by halves, Marshall and ""2 Guns"" scenarist Andrew Cosby shun subtlety without a qualm. Ultimately, hardcore ""Hellboy"" fans are going to drool over this R-rated bloodbath and its dynamic visuals.Some things have changed between the first two ""Hellboy"" movies and this quasi-reboot/sequel. Gone is the affection Ron Perlman's Hellboy lavished on furry-tailed felines. David Harbour's Hellboy keeps no pets. Nevertheless, whether Perlman or Harbour, they play the same enormous, brawny, crimson-skinned, supernatural beast with horns and a tail conjured up from Hell by Nazi occultists in a last-ditch effort to win World War II. The Dark Horse Comics character walks upright on cloven hoofs, with a giant right hand of stone nicknamed the 'Right Hand of Doom.' If there is any physical difference between them, then it's Harbour who appears far bulkier and huskier. Decked out in the long coat, each lugged around a huge gun and dripped sarcasm in every sentence. Comparably, Harbour's Hellboy is more youthful, irater, and prone to going off on a tangent. Apparently, after ""Hellboy"" (2004) and ""Hellboy II: The Golden Army"" (2008), Ron Perlman and writer & director Guillermo del Toro couldn't convince the studio to let them take a third whack at Mike Mignola's notorious character.The primary difference between Guillermo del Toro's two ""Hellboy"" epics and Neil Marshall's reboot is the far greater emphasis on blood, splatter, and gore instead of over absurdity. The new ""Hellboy"" wallows in carnage galore, and Marshall pulls no punches in his depiction of combat between the eponymous hero and three lofty giants. Indeed, Marshall stages one lengthy scene when Hellboy tangles with that ugly trio. The seamless CGI thrusts Harbour into a make-believe, fairy tale world with these lumbering giants out to destroy him. They swat Hellboy around like a shuttlecock at a badminton match. Look out when Hellboy punches them in their eyes. However, Marshall doesn't hold these bloodbaths in reserve as the plot draws to a climax. Instead, ""Hellboy"" unfolds with an angry witch, the evil Blood Queen Vivian Nimue (Ukrainian-born supermodel Milla Jovovich of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise), getting the wrong end of a javelin through her lovely torso. Skewered through completely to a huge oak tree in the year 517 during the Dark Ages, she vows to haunt her tormentors. Although she is impaled on the javelin, Queen Vivian pulls herself desperately along the shaft toward the end. King Arthur (Mark Stanley of ""Game of Thrones"") doesn't let her off the stick. Wielding his legendary sword Excalibur, Arthur hacks off her head! Afterward, Nimue's chopped up body parts are locked up in separate caskets. Arthur dispatches six of his bravest knights to ride to Britain's distant quarters of to bury their boxes with a holy seal. Little does King Arthur know that his precautions to keep Nimue apart from herself are doomed.Literally, blood streams like a river through this over-the-top outing. Predictably, despite the opening prologue that puts our villainess at an extreme disadvantage, Queen Vivian refuses to take her medicine lying down. Baba Yaga summons a loquacious boar, Gruagach (voice of Stephen Graham of ""London Boulevard""), and it retrieves all of the boxes of Queen Vivian's appendages. Eventually, she emerges from captivity with a bad attitude. Considering the vast length of time of her imprisonment, the Queen is eager to payback 'in spades.' Unlike the previous ""Hellboys,"" the reboot involves some other interesting characters, chiefly the Nazi-killing vigilante Lobster Johnson (Thomas Hadden Church of ""Spider Man 3""), another invincible buccaneer who dresses like a World War I pilot. Johnson doesn't stick around long, but he makes quite an impression with his claw emblem with which he brands his enemies. ""John Wick"" co-star Ian McShane steps into John Hurt's shoes as Professor Broom and chews the scenery with relish. Considerably more robust than his fragile predecessor, McShane has a field day with the role. Milla Jovovich makes an unrepentant villainess who refuses to go quietly. David Harbour imbues his Hellboy with enough charisma that you wish he'd have a chance to develop it in further sequels. Happily, Marshall keeps Hellboy in constant peril, so the 2 hour plus running time never takes its' toll. Again, based on its dismal box office, this may be Harbour's only take on the role unless fans come to his rescue.",Hellboy
13,oscaralbert,"The so-called ""British Isles"" are infamous for churning out inedible ""puddings"" . . .",6,25 April 2019,". . . but HELLBOY really takes the cake. This unsavory goulash of ingredients includes queens chopped into mincemeat, giants skewered in the eye, demons shish-kabobbed on various pointy things, trees that bleed, nimble old hags contorting themselves into spider women, sticky kisses, shape-shifters, Arthurian Legends, folks turning into wind-blown dust, and a giant dose of the sit-com character ""Alf."" Most viewers will be crammed toward the back of their seats, hoping for eventual visual relief, maybe in the form of a kitchen sink being thrown into this ill-considered conglomeration. No such luck. The insidious makers of HELLBOY insure that there is not a moment of screen time devoted to anything from the Known World. None of the myriad parts of this flick make much sense when taken separately; pity the poor bloke who feels compelled to attempt any comprehension of the nonexistent ""Big Picture."" HELLBOY is a witches' brew featuring a pinch of this, and a drizzle of that. These disparate ingredients are mixed together in a fairly random fashion deviously designed to provide NO aesthetic pleasure. When Today's nefarious Pachyderm Party members are finally routed and descend to meet their Maker, let's hope that Old Scratch tortures them with continuous, eternal screenings of HELLBOY.",Hellboy

There's more of a sense of threat, both to and from him: He sometimes gets seriously hurt in fights where it makes sense for him to. And you feel that he might actually embrace his evil nature, rejecting the ""nurturing"" meant to keep him from doing so) questions his place in the world, as he fights creatures that hide in the shadows, wondering what, if anything, makes him any different from them. Professor Broom(McShane, his ""tough love"" step dad), and others, repeatedly(somewhere between 3 and 5 times. Seriously. It gets pretty old) tell him to man up. After all, someone is working on restoring Nimue(Jovovich, absolutely perfect casting, just as many had figured she would be) to her full strength, at which point she intends to unleash a plague on the entire planet, as well as an army of nightmarish beasts, including a few that literally rise from the netherworld, and look like they stepped right out of a Silent Hill game. They're amazing. Honestly all of the designs of beings in this are truly inspired. Fortunately he will not have to fight them alone. He's joined by psychic Alice(Lane, charming) and special forces member Ben(Dae Kim, prepared to do what's necessary to save us all). And a third of the way in, once they start directly interacting with the plot(before that point it's only themes for them. The bad guys get both right from the start), which comes across as over-complicated even though it's in reality straightforward(not saying that that, by itself, is a negative), they're a force to be reckoned with.There's a lot to love here. Many individual pieces of greatness, that, believe me, I'm very sorry to say, ultimately do not completely congeal into a satisfying whole. This has an R rating in part because Deadpool did so well. So this tries too hard to go for some of the same things, especially the humour(wisely avoiding 4th wall breaking, which works for that but wouldn't for this), full of modern references. Trust me, it will get tiring even if only near the very end of it, when it did for me. CGI's hit and miss. The action is immensely entertaining. I'm not sure I agree with those who say that the tones don't mix well, and I can emphatically say that they nail the individual ones. This includes the chilling horror, which brings us the utterly terrifying Baba Yaga.This contains a lot of bloody, gory(while I have a very high tolerance for that, I have to admit, it probably is excessive) violence, as well as harsh swearing. 6/10",Hellboy

His imagination is beyond anything this film has to offer. Even his weakest films, such as Doomsday, have interesting concepts and are visually stunning, but this had so much studio interference, it wreaks of lost potential.Hellboy is a behemoth of ideas, dark, sparse, and ideally funny, and whilst the gore quota is high, it's here only for exploitation, and adds nothing to the story or narrative.The cast are fine, given the dire material they blurt out of their mouth, and Harbour makes for a fine Hellboy, but it's a soulless venture come the end.CGI is okay, but it becomes overkill after a while, and the language isn't there because we all love an R-rated comic book film ala Deadpool, it's just there for pure titillation, and it becomes tiresome as the film goes on, especially from Graham, who must be regretting his contract signing.Add McShane amd Jovovich as filler, and what you have is a desperate attempt to cash in on what is otherwise a fruitful genre that has plenty of legs on it yet.A travesty.",Hellboy

19,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"An aberration they tried to hide, but failed to succeed",2,20 April 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn the times of King Arthur, Nimmue (Milla Jovovich), the 'Blood Queen', was cut into pieces and parts of her buried in different places, so it would be more difficult to resurrect her and bring her evil spells back to life. In modern day London, Hellboy (David Harbour), the half human/half demon superhero, is burned out after a mission went wrong in Mexico, but is dispatched by Professor Broom (Ian McShane), his father figure, to the headquarters of the Cult of Osiris, plunging him into a hell for leather battle, involving Arthur's sword and the resurrection of the Blood Queen, who's planning a dreadful fate for the modern world.It's a very uncomfortable reminder of just how old you're getting, when you can remember when the original version of a film that's become the latest to have a 'reboot', in popular modern parlance, came out fifteen years ago. Unlike Guillermo Del Toro's visual sculpture fantasy (which spawned a sequel of fairly equal quality) however, this present day adaptation of the comic book, from decorated Brit director Neil Marshall, has been ushered out with reasonable publicity, but no press screenings. Always pretty indicative of a disaster, and sadly this mess is certainly no surprise.From the offset, it's clearly aiming for a more edgy but light hearted vibe, with a voiceover describing the historical pretext for the films plot using foul language, and this is a tone it maintains throughout. Unfortunately, it doesn't guide it in any way where you end up with characters to root for, or a plot to care about. It may be a horror/action film, but by anyone's standards, Marshall really pounds the baseline with an overly loud heavy metal soundtrack that's totally disconcerting, although nothing more so like this than one of the main characters being a big, grotesque warthog with a scouse accent (who we later learn is voiced by Stephen Graham!), who in one incomprehensible scene transforms into a fake baby, before turning into a minature version of itself, scurrying away and going on about child abuse! As if it wasn't all visually disturbing enough!The special effects, visuals and some of the action may be quite impressive, but with such an incoherent and uninvolving story, with such unengaging characters, they all fall by the by. Del Toro's 00s versions are still quite fresh in the mind, and despite being far from masterpieces themselves, will still create a much better impression than this witless, charmless, sprawling farrago, with a much better Hellboy in Ron Perlman to boot. *",Hellboy
20,Pjtaylor-96-138044,There are things that go bump in the night. This is one of them.,4,14 April 2019,"'Hellboy (2019)' is actually worse than I could have ever imagined. It's a real mess. Its plot is poorly constructed and its filmmaking is ill conceived. Worse still, it isn't even entertaining... like, at all. I mean, there's a brief, almost miraculous window where a few, but only a few, of the movie's many plot-threads somehow manage to come together in a relatively satisfying way. This climax is perhaps the only part of the picture that actually resembles a competent piece of story-telling, though. I do only mean ""competent"", too. It's not like the thing suddenly turns into Shakespeare. Even so, the opening stands in stark contrast to this, as it's perhaps - no joke - one of the worst things I've seen in the cinema in quite sometime. It sets the tone for a clunky, clumsy and curious experience that keeps getting worse and worse (until it somehow gets slightly better). Seriously, it's strange how bad it is. Pretty much everyone involved is capable of so much better and, as evidenced by the Del Toro efforts (which I won't compare this with), it's not like the source material is unsalvageable. To be fair, David Arbour is doing a really good job with what he has, standing out as the flick's best aspect. The other actors are doing just fine, too - even if some of them can't quite pull off the accents they're attempting. The other departments are almost all slacking, however. At least, that's how it seems in the final product which, of course, could all be down to a sloppy, maybe studio-meddled, final edit. The editing is one of the weaker aspects, feeling generally choppy in the moment and bizarrely unstructured as a whole. Several scenes happen which ought to be game-changing, but they're just forgotten about pretty much as quickly as they're introduced. Others take a long time to tell a short story, shall we say, and are often left unresolved. You'll wonder why both of these types were included in the first place. Don't even get me started on the flashbacks. Throughout it all, there's a ton of noticeable ADR - which signals some post-production fiddling. Even though it's often used to repeat unnecessary, ham-fisted exposition (yes, I said ""repeat""), it doesn't fulfil its traditional purpose and change, or clarify, the narrative in any meaningful way. Still, I can't help but feel like what's on-screen isn't all that close to what was - originally, at least - on the page. There are enough signs, and seams, to point to this, if not quite prove it. Either way, the film doesn't feel like it's about anything - and I'm talking narrative here, never-mind theme. It meanders about, taking far too much time to linger on its hefty amounts of meaningless gore, until it sort of gets into gear towards the end. Here, not only does it have a relatively clear, beat-to-beat story, but it also gives its hero a bit of an arc. By this point, though, it's too little too late. 4/10",Hellboy
21,MLDinTN,decent fantasy film,6,16 December 2019,"From what I remember, I think this Hellboy is better than the other Hellboy films. There's lots of action and lots of comic looking gore. The story is rather simple and involves the legend of King Arthur. An evil witch was dismembered by Arthur and now her minons are back to gather her pieces to put her back together and then she will release the plague to wipe out civilization. It turns out Hellboy is the last decendent of Arthur and can wield Excalibur to defeat the witch. So we get a lot of mythical beings in between, the giant kills were cool. And of course the end is the stand off between the witch and Hellboy.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good special effects. Some are cartoon-like but it is involving CGI creatures. Overall, those wanting a cool action film will like this.",Hellboy
22,Cineanalyst,"Alice, Arthur, Hellboy, Jekyll and Hyde, and Leni",3,8 October 2019,"The idea here seems to have been to throw a bunch of threads from various sources at the screen and to hope something sticks, or at least to continually lunge forward in the hope that the momentum will keep it afloat. This ""Hellboy"" reboot seems to have stirred a considerable amount of nostalgia for Guillermo del Toro's prior two Hellboy movies, but I never liked them. They were as full of clichés (remember the swooshing-and-whooshing blade twirling nonsense?) and references that went nowhere (de Toro was especially fond of clocks and puppets, for whatever reasons, as well as trying to associate his pictures with classic Universal monster movies). And, so, with this ""Hellboy"" reboot, we get the swaying camera, long-take fight sequences, to rock music, instead, and a slew of references to seemingly-irrelevant material: to Lewis Carroll's book ""Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Saw There,"" to the King Arthur and Merlin mythology as remembered through other movies, to Leni Riefenstahl filming the Nazi scene we've already seen another version of 15 years ago, and a Jekyll-and-Hyde type creature (he even injects drugs) who is an utter bore. Some horror-film gore is added, too, for an R-rating rather than the absurdity of bloodless PG-13 violence in the prior installments, as well as in most comic-book superhero fare. It's an obnoxious hodgepodge of horrific fairytale creatures nonetheless.This ""Hellboy"" is sorely overloaded with backstories, subplots and set-ups for sequels that will never happen, including stupid mid and after-credits scenes. The origins story is basically the same as the 2004 version, too, so you'd think they could've cut more of it out. Adding Riefenstahl there to film Hellboy's arrival to Earth was a nice self-reflexive touch, but the rest of the movie doesn't follow through on it. Likewise, the Alice and Jekyll/Hyde characters straddle two worlds, as did Lewis Carroll and Robert Louis Stevenson's protagonists, but that's the extent of the references. With Hellboy seen reading Carroll's book in one scene and another where Alice recites the Jabberwocky poem, I especially expected more of a connection there. I've recently read the Alice books, too, as well as having read Stevenson's years ago, so this was disappointing for me. On the other hand, that the picture does go through with a firmer through-line to the King Arthur stuff is eye-rollingly bad. It's as though someone wanted to remake ""Hellboy"" as a slasher film with a slight Gothic-horror allusion, while another wanted to imitate the MCU but with long takes instead of rapid cuts, while still another filmmaker had just seen two of Disney's lesser feature-length cartoons and so threw in the Alice and Arthur stuff, with the result being a plot that rapidly jumps around too much to be much about anything. It's disorganized and unengaging.",Hellboy

I stayed away from the early reviews and haven't even looked upon IMDb before seeing it. Its not that i'm a huge Hellboy fan, no, its simply because i just wanted to see a movie open minded and really didn't care much about it. After seeing it and now looking upon all the negative score this movie got received already i can say - movie was not bad at all. I mean i did not expected anything from it to be honest, but it did surprised me (kinda in a positive way) that it was bloody and was definitely rated R - this i didn't knew as well. The movie was very fast paced - there is barely a second to breath and there were some very original ideas with creatures in it - like Baba Yaga and some other i won't spoil.Overall, i kinda enjoyed ""Hellboy"" on a dumb Friday evening tonight in a movie theater.

Still, from the trailers it did look interesting, so I thought I might go and give it a shot. It turned out to be rather disappointing actually, and I can't say that I am all that surprised as well.Look, I never really followed the Hellboy franchise all that much. In fact, I never really followed comics either, but a part of my upbringing sort of put me off such concepts as Hellboy. Yeah, the whole son of a demon price sort of thing that results in him being half-human. Still, it seemed as if the character was pretty good, so I decided to give it a shot. As you can probably suspect, this is all about fighting paranormal enemies, and of course you can't get anything more paranormal than Hellboy.So, he is called to London where it turns out that he is being set up because there are these prophecies that suggest that he is going to destroy the world. Yeah, this witchqueen was killed sometime back in the dark ages, and her body was cut up and scattered about England. However, her servants are slowly bringing her back together again.Yet the story is really all over the place, and characters sort of come and go without any real reason. In fact, we have one character who betrays the Blood Queen, helps her return, only to betray her again, and that in a matter of minutes - it really makes no sense. Oh, and the exposition at the beginning? Well, it was pretty bad, in fact it was quite cringeworthy.It seemed as if this film may have had some potential, but in many cases it just seems to miss the mark on so many levels.

31,cruise01,"A darker version of Hellboy delivers the action, gore, and cheesy with its humor.",8,13 April 2019,"Hellboy (4 out of 5 stars).Hellboy is a dark superhero film that is a reboot to Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy movies which comes back in a bloodier, violent, and dark direction. I love Guillermo del Toro Hellboy movies which we did not get the third sequel it deserved. And Ron Perlman's performance as Hellboy was perfect. This reboot does not disappoint. It is darker, bloodier and gorier, and it delivers with its exciting action. It does lack the fun humor that the first two Hellboy movies had.This is a dark comic book character being brought to the big screen does serve the character a little justice with its dark version. This new Hellboy look is grimier. David Harbour does make a good choice to play the character. Yes, I still like Ron Perlman's take on the character. Harbour tries to bring the big bad red devil character while trying to be a wise trash talking hero. This new film story follows Nimue (Milla Jovovich) a blood witch that was destroyed long time ago by King Arthur. And in present time, a hog like creature is trying to revive and bring back Nimue. So she can take over the world. Hellboy and his organization of Bureau for Paranormal Research are trying to stop Nimue from destroying the world. It does have a flashback to make this an origin story of how Hellboy is brought into this world. Plus with some new surprises of characters we haven't seen before in other films. There is Alice (Sasha Lane) who is Hellboy's sidekick and has abilities she learns throughout the movie. Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim) a military guy who can transform into a jaguar beast. Ian McShane plays Trevor who is like a father figure to Hellboy and he does a good job as well. Milla Jovovich is a good playing the villain as well. Sadly, Nimue and Hellboy climatic fight was brief and disappointing.The film does deliver a lot of bloody action sequences. This film is violent and gorier than the other movies. Almost looks like a gory video game with Hellboy facing against giants, demonic beasts, and witches. There are a few awesome action scenes with a great rock soundtrack during a few of those sequences. Do expect a lot of limbs being torn off from people and guts and gore splattering everywhere. Which works well for this type of film. Neil Marshall direction is darker and violent. It does lack the fun humor with the character. The script does take itself too serious which makes this film feel a little dull than the original movies. When it does try for the humor. It just becomes awkward and unfunny. Even Ian McShane narrative dialogue felt cheesy in the beginning of the film.Overall, Hellboy is a good film. It may lack the fun energy the original movies had. While this one delivers its darker, bloodier, and violent direction with Hellboy facing against monsters.",Hellboy
32,eddie_baggins,Witness the demise of Hellboy in this shoddy affair,4,25 July 2019,"With many overcoming the initial sadness of the failed Hellboy 3 that would've seen Oscar winning director Guillermo Del Toro re-team with his favourite leading man Ron Perlman for another dose of imagination overload and Barry Manalow's singalongs, hype began to grow for a very adult take on the cult graphic novel creation that starred Stranger Things breakout star David Harbour and was directed by the man responsible for cult films such as Dog Soldiers and The Descent as well as some of the all-time great Game of Thrones episodes.Unfortunately for the great big red guy, Harbour and director Neil Marshall, this violence filled and expletive ridden reimagining of Mike Mignola's creation is one of the great failures of 2019, virtually killing off the chances of future Hellboy installments and halting Harbour's chances of leading too many more Hollywood films moving forward.Budgeted at a quite decent $50 million dollars and featuring talented performers such as Milla Jovovich, Ian McShane and Daniel Dae Kim, Hellboy certainly had enough talent surrounding it to be something of note and still maintains slight moments of character charm, creature carnage and possibilities throughout that never help it overcome a feeling that this cold, heartless and rather cheap and nasty feeling film just lacks the soul or energy to do its character and plot justice.Featuring such random interludes as giant hunting, Nazi era flashbacks, Jovovich's evil plan for ultimate destruction and bizarrely a resurrected Merlin, Hellboy has a lot of ideas and components going on that Marshall never wrangles together into a cohesive whole and while the capable director knows how to handle an action scene or two, most of Hellboy's big set-ups and set-pieces take place in a lethargic and enthusiasm free environment that stems mostly out of a bored looking cast, tired and heartless sets, sub-par CGI and over the top violence that feels more forced than natural in the modern age where adult focussed comic book films are a sub-genre unto their own.Del Toro's previous Hellboy films all mixed soulful characters and emotionally strong components with fun and wild blockbuster sensibilities, something that this Hellboy lacks in spades.You feel sorry for Harbour in particular who doesn't get the best material to work with here thanks to the mediocre script work by Andrew Cosby.It's a shame as he feels like a solid choice for the big handed red devil and shows more than a few moments where his natural charisma and presence shines in the film but there's frighteningly little support around him and as Hellboy's downright terrible story draws us across the globe in a variety of situations we can't get invested in, it's quite clear early on that Marshall's film had very little chance of matching Del Toro's take on the figure or enlivening the series enough to make audiences care about ever seeing another big screen Hellboy moving forward.Final Say -With a few very minor wins over its run-time and a committed but misused David Harbour at its disposal, this rough and bloody Hellboy isn't a complete horror story but it's not a film you'd be recommending loudly in a crowded marketplace filled with far better graphic novel/comic book offerings.

34,leonblackwood,Can touch Ron Perlman as Hellboy! 3/10,3,4 February 2020,"Review:
Whoever did the make-up for this Hellboy should get the sack because he looked more like the zombie version of Michael Jackson in Thriller. On top of that, the storyline wasn't that great, and I missed the screen charisma from Ron Perlman, who was fantastic as the original Hellboy. Although this is a reboot and not the 3rd movie in the franchise, I'm not impressed with the direction that they have taken Hellboy. The brilliant wit, and great characters in the first two movies, made them a joy to watch, but this film was a full-out horror, which was a bad decision in my opinion. I know that the director was trying to stay true to the comic books, but you can't expect the audience to change their perception of Hellboy after watching Guillermo del Toro's interpretation, which went down well at the box office. The annoying soundtrack and over-exaggerated bloody scenes went from bad to worse, and the whole ""devil woman taking over the world"" theme was a bit ridiculous. There are some decent action scenes, like the fight between the giants and Hellboy, but apart from that, I was pretty disappointed.
Anyway, the film kicks off in 517 A.D., where the evil Blood Queen Vivienne Nimue (Milla Jovovich), unleashes a plague on England until King Arthur thwarts her with the aid of Ganeida, a member of her coven. Arthur uses Excalibur to dismember Nimue and hides her remains across England. In present-day Tijuana, Mexico, paranormal investigator Hellboy (David Harbour) accidentally kills missing agent Esteban Ruiz, who has been transformed into a vampire, during a wrestling match. After hearing Ruiz's dying words, prophesying that the end is coming, Hellboy is brought back to the B.P.R.D. in Colorado. He is assigned by B.P.R.D. leader Trevor Bruttenholm (Ian McShane), his adoptive human father, to assist the Osiris Club in hunting three giants in Great Britain. The club's seer, Lady Hatton (Sophie Okonedo), reveals Bruttenholm was meant to kill Hellboy when he came into the human world as a result of the Nazis Project Ragna Rok, but instead raised him. Meanwhile, a pig-like fairy known as Gruagach is advised by the witch Baba Yaga to retrieve Nimue's limbs, so she may grant his wish for revenge against Hellboy. During the hunt, Hellboy is betrayed and nearly killed by the hunters before they are ambushed by the giants. Hellboy fights and kills the giants until he collapses from exhaustion, only to be rescued by a young woman. He awakens in her flat, recognising her as Alice Monaghan (Sasha Lane), a medium he once rescued from fairies as a baby. Sending an SO19 team to retrieve Hellboy, Bruttenholm relays that Nimue's remains have been taken and the last piece is at the Osiris Club. They are introduced to M11 agent Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim), as Hellboy and Alice join the team and head to the club. Finding the club slain, Alice channels Hatton's spirit, who reveals that Nimue seeks Hellboy in order to cause the apocalypse. Nimue's arm is stolen by Gruagach, and Nimue distracts Hellboy by appealing to his frustrations, allowing Gruagach to escape. Hellboy reveals that Gruagach is a changeling who took baby Alice's place before Hellboy branded him with iron and forced him to return Alice, which led to Gruagach hating Hellboy for taking his chance to be human. Daimio takes them to M11 headquarters before secretly acquiring a special bullet to kill Hellboy. After an argument with Bruttenholm about his adoption, Hellboy angrily storms off until he is magically transported to Baba Yaga's house. Having shot out Baba Yaga's eye, Hellboy is talked into giving up one of his eyes for Nimue's location. Hellboy reneges on the deal and is cursed to lose a loved one. On the way to Nimue's location at Pendleton, Diamo reveals to Alice that he was the sole survivor of a demonic jaguar attack. The trio arrives at Nimue's full resurrection, as she kills her coven with the exception of Ganeida, while Hellboy stops her, but is overwhelmed by her powers. Nimue poisons Alice and flees, as Ganeida directs Hellboy to the resting place of Merlin to save Alice. After Merlin cures Alice and puts her and Daimio to sleep, he reveals Hellboy is Anung un Rama, heir of Arthur through his mother, who was spirited to Hell by his father. When offered Excalibur, Hellboy refuses after seeing a vision of himself causing the apocalypse, while Merlin, having exhausted his magic, disintegrates. Meanwhile, Nimue attacks M11 and abducts Bruttenholm as the group follow her to St. Paul's Cathedral. There, Hellboy battles an empowered Gruagach aided by Daimio in his jaguar form. However, Nimue kills Gruagach and propels Hellboy into Arthur's hidden tomb that holds Excalibur. Enraged, Hellboy pulls out the sword after Nimue kills Bruttenholm, allowing demons to emerge from Hell. Will Hellboy turn to the darkside and join forces with Nimue, or will he come to his senses and kill the evil witch? You have to watch the film to find out!
As a lot of the plot was taken from the comics, I can't really blame the filmmakers for producing such a poor script, but they really didn't do it any justice. On the plus side, it is non-stop from the beginning to the end, and you will end up seeing it through because you want to know how it all pans out, but once it's all over, I doubt that you will be watching it again. The first two movies had memorable moments, and I have personally watched the first movie many times, but this film was a complete let-down. Disappointing!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Neil Marshall, who also brought you Dog Soldiers in 2002, The Descent, Doomsday, Centurion, a couple of episodes of Game of Thrones and Tales of Halloween. Judging by his previous work, he is obviously known for his horror movies, so it's not surprising that this movie turned out as it did. The previous Hellboy movies have all made a profit at the box office, but this movie failed to make any money, so I can't see there being a sequel, even though the ending was left open. Once Guillermo del Toro and Ron Perlman said that they wouldn't return for the 3rd movie, they should have left this project alone because it was there brilliant vision and great wit that made Hellboy a household name.Budget: $50million

35,TheMovieDiorama,Hellboy should've remained in the fiery inferno of the underworld.,2,16 April 2019,"Critics banished it, audiences failed to connect with it and production was apparently a nightmare. Some may say this unnecessary reboot was doomed from the start. But you know what? I went in with an open mind. I wanted everyone to be wrong. The feeling of being proved totally incorrect is an overwhelming sensation. Yet, unfortunately, this film is a bloody travesty. Shambolic as soon as McShane started slurring his narration as if he was inebriated. I shall endeavour to find some positives however. Just bare with me. The blood queen has been dismembered to which a hog-like fairy scours England finding the boxes to which her limbs are stored in. It's up to Hellboy to stop this from happening whilst also not touching Excalibur and something to do with a wild hunt.To put it simply, a catastrophic mess. I mean, where to even begin with this? I suppose the main culprit is the script, considering it acts as the nervous system for the film's entirety. Cosby's screenplay draws inspiration from various comics that Hellboy originated from, yet presents them as nods for fanboys as opposed to integrating them into a cohesive story. 'Hellboy in Mexico' lasts for about two minutes whereas 'The Wild Hunt' never seems to end. All of these sub-plots acting as distractions from the primary storyline which, firstly acts as uninspired fan service, and secondly loses all focus from the ""my name is Queen Nimue, and I worked for the underworld"" (subtle Jovovich reference...) central plot. It's acceptable to appeal to hardcore fans of a source material, but without any integral structure or engaging dialogue it will lose its accessibility, consequently attracting no one.Speaking of dialogue, some of those lines were like having a stake to the heart. ""Google translate that for me"". Oh hunny, no one says that and no one has ever said that. Zero jokes/quips landed. A big fat zero. And apparently everyone in England shouts expletives in every frickin' sentence. I don't know what they frickin' mean, we don't frickin' swear constantly...! Frick! Characters, like Lobster Johnson, jump into the story for one second (with no introduction) and then never mentioned again. Even going as far as recreating Hellboy's origin story to which we saw in Del Toro's superior adaptation. Unfavourably comparing adaptations is something I try to avoid, especially when neither are masterpieces. But damn, watching this makes Del Toro's seem like the 'Citizen Kane' of Hellboy films. Atleast he understood the characters and the intricate relationships between them all.Marshall went for spectacle and unsurprisingly backfired big time. The visual effects were not up to standard, despite some excessive gore which did grant a minuscule amount of charm. The soundtrack was obnoxious. And the editing was haphazard, especially during the Baba Yaga fight sequence. Wait, who or what even is she!?Surely the acting can save this disastrous flick? Ehh. Wrong again. Harbour has good intentions, but is directed poorly by Marshall. His physical prowess suits the character of Hellboy perfectly, but when he acts as a juvenile teenager (just so that he differs from Perlman's interpretation) and literally shouts every word, he loses the essence of the titular character. Absent of any emotion, this film takes a major step back for the hero, yet Harbour isn't the worst actor. Jovovich, my sweet sweet Milla, is given nothing and instantly becomes a forgettable villain. Dae Kim was putting on a British accent I think? I don't even think he knows. But the worst performance has to go to Monaghan who was insufferably irritating. Just get rid of her. I will however appreciate Big Mo from 'Eastenders' and the chip shop ""Codswallop"". But that's it. That's where I draw the line for positives.Oh, and bring a notepad. Because the amount of exposition and heavy-handed storytelling is ludicrous. In fact, practically every line is used to further plot and not the characters. An R-rated Hellboy reboot sounds good on paper, and I wanted to love it. Yet when a story is so incomprehensibly boring, bolstered by shoddy performances, writing and editing, it's very difficult to find any redeeming qualities. Had this been the first adaptation and released in the mid naughties, it still would've been received poorly. A bad film is a bad film and Hellboy is just that. The fire has gone and the underworld of Hollywood has claimed its next intellectual property, which coincidentally is this year's worst film thus far. Great!",Hellboy

Hellboy is interesting but most of the other characters are not. The story is not too good. The effects are hit and miss. I also don't know why the film makers went for such a hard ""R"" rating. One gory scene, in particular, took a lot of wind out of the movie for a while. Whatever it was they were trying to achieve, I don't think it worked. Another problem was the length. It's about twenty minutes too long. ""Hellboy"" was okay, I guess, but I doubt I'll be revisiting it any time soon.",Hellboy

41,southdavid,Harbouring A Grudge,3,15 April 2019,"I'm going to try my hardest here to review the film we got and not just lament not getting the conclusion of the trilogy that a visionary Oscar winning director inexplicably wanted to make. Fortunately, the film itself is so objectively terrible, such a staggering misfire, writing the review was easy.Hellboy (David Harbour) is sent to the U.K. to assist hunting giants. He stumbles into a plot to resurrect Nimue (Mila Jovovich) and ancient witch dismembered by King Arthur centuries before.
It's a very tiresome film, leaping around madly from scene to scenes desperately extending its thin plot to make the run time. It's also, and this is the real killer both charmless and witless. It's action scenes are terrible, consequence free violence with bad CGI. Hellboy has no particular skill in these fights either, he's just capable of taking untold amounts of damage and does so until his opponent is stopped by something else.
But if the story is a mishmash of half an ideas here and there (which if the producer interference stories are to be believed, is the case) it's nothing compared to the awful script. There isn't one likeable character in the film, this unfortunately includes the titular one. There's no underlying warmth to Harbours performance. Maybe it's the prosthetics (that are much worse than in Del Toro's version, despite a decade of technology improvements) but it's also what's written for him. His lines, and the whole film, are entirely without humour and none of the relationships between any of the characters is the least bit warm or empathetic. I also didn't care for any of the supporting characters, even the one's played by actors I enjoy in other things, like Ian McShane.
There's one other massively jarring element of the film, the music. Generic bland metal that crashes in and drags you out of the scene.I did quite enjoy the scenes of mass graphic destruction that make up the climax of the film but that precious little in a film that palpably feels like it was made of absolutely the lowest possible cost and still be passable. A target they still missed by some margin.",Hellboy
42,videorama-759-859391,A Hell Of A Night,6,30 April 2019,"Who the hell is David Harbour? This was a question I've been asking myself, where just by co incidence, in the last week, I've come across his name a few times, either by starting credits off a movie, the back page of a script in book form, etc. I looked him up, and clearly, I remember his face vividly, as one of the sicko killers, in 2014's A Walk Among The Tombstones. After seeing him in Hellboy, he's the only actor, I've been blessed, and holy relived to see in that role, although the prize stealing performance has to go to Milla Jovavich, as the evil nemesis, and still she's so f.ckin' gorgeous. Honestly, she blew me away, in an acting feat, I never thought her capable of. It's hard to rate Hellboy on a 1 to 10. It's a great night at the movies, sure, something totally different in a R 18+ movie, which I did expect much more go, as in frequency. It dishes out quite a good serve. A lot of the scenes though, for me, are like ones out of other kinds of movies like this, of past, where we walk cliched paths. It's the simple, limited plotting of story, and premise, that's the main, and patent problem here. Again cliche'd. That repellent pig character reminded me of a baby 1984 Deathstalker. Basically. Hellboy is a much unloved monster, who works among us humans for this agency. Called back, in the wake of a accidental tragedy, involving his prior assignment, to hunt down a deserter, his new operative is, you guessed it, isJovavich's character, and her timeless beauty just sizzles up the screen, it's such a waste to annihilate someone this hot. She's like a imprint in my brain. The reason, she has to be destroyed of course, is she has diabolical plans, to wipe out ole London, and then some. I really loved the generous combination of humour in this film, where mean faced Harbour could only deliver the lines so comically serious, but again, as I said it was Jovavich's striking female fetale performance, that jumped out a me, while Ian Mcshane, who even showed up in a preview of another film, before the lights went down, and the big feature started, did us solid, as Hellboy's father. The film has killer lines, and the casting is in variety of brilliance, and the film impresses and dazzles, either with vivid photography, and heavy blood gushing violence, but it just feels like many parts of other medi-evil movies, particularly story, and cliched premise, which is the film's main problem. One too, wonders why it didn't come out in 3D.",Hellboy
43,subxerogravity,"I was worried about this reboot, but this is good!",6,12 April 2019,"I was kinda hating on David Harbor as the new Helboy, but they did something similar to what happen with Aquaman, they surrounded this dude with enough bells and whistles and focus on making the film good overall.
Harbor played Helboy his way which was less low key than Ron Pearlman's charater, it's hard to separate Pearlman from Helboy, so Harbor had big shoes to fill and he filled them well.
Amazing cast. Once again kudos to Ed Skrien whose not in the movie because he graciously bowed out to allow Daniel DAE Kim to get the role, which he was perfect for. The audience wAnted to see diversity and Helboy delivered.
A pretty epic story. I don't know if it's actually based on one of the Helboy comics but I have to say I loved the imagery. Del Turo's Helboy brought Mike Mignola's pages to life, this new director, bought in his own artist and it was good. Very comic book and at the same time very Heavy Metal, so that works for me.

Was really hoping for a part 3, but that didn't happen. So we got a reboot instead, and how does it hold up?
It's alright, I mean nothing I want to keep watching over again, but it does have fun humorous horror like feel to it, like the 2004 film, but this version goes even darker, it's got Evil Dead like violence. But is there a plot, well kind of, it's all over the place. David Harbour is pretty good has Hellboy, even though a few times I was missing Ron Perlman, and felt Harbour was Perlman for some scenes.

46,jadavix,About what you'd expect,5,29 July 2019,"I had reservations about watching this new ""Hellboy"", due to the absence of del Toro and Perlman. Ron Perlman IS Hellboy. When the creator of the comic book and the director of the first film stated their ideal choice for the role, they both listed Perlman at once. He made the role his.The guy they got to replace him isn't as bad as he might've been, I guess, though he's no Ron Perlman. He's not as charismatic, and nor does he have the ability to avoid being buried under the make up. They could have swapped him for another actor from scene to scene, and you may not have noticed.What sold me was the violence of this version. It got a rare R18+ rating solely for violence in Australia, which made me curious to see how violent a movie has to be to get that rating. It does have some cool gore, showing people being ripped apart, having their jaws ripped off, having their skulls de-masked.But if that's all you're watching it for, you're going to be pretty bored for a lot of its length. There are only a few such scenes in the movie. It also has some cool effects shots, with some interesting looking creatures.But what of the story? It just doesn't sustain the movie, and certainly not to the idiotic two hour run-time. I can't even tell you what it was really about, other than the typical good-vs-evil thing. It fails at interesting you in the machinations of the plot. So you end up with some cool gore, cool effects, a so-so protagonist, and not much else.",Hellboy

The majority of this one takes place in England, being British myself I loved this. King Arthur and Merlin make appearances and the film features the famous Pendle HIll, known for its association with witchcraft. Even Rasputin has a minor part! Milla Jovovich plays an evil witch and looks utterly stunning as always. This movie features a plenty of violence, gore and some strong swearing, not really a film for young kids. Hellboy is a supernatural hero and the film combines action, horror, fantasy and comedy. I am not a great lover of CGI but the special effects were pretty good. Plot wise it isn't up to much, this is definitely a popcorn movie, it won't tax the brain, just sit back and enjoy the visual onslaught.NB there are two post end scenes, one mid credits and one at the very end.

48,stevendbeard,Focuses More On the Supernatural Elements,7,13 April 2019,"I saw ""Hellboy"", starring David Harbour-Stranger Things_tv, Suicide Squad; Milla Jovovich-the Resident Evil movies, Dazed and Confused; Ian McShane-the John Wick movies, We Are Marshall and Daniel Dae Kim-Hawaii Five_O_tv, Lost_tv.
This is a reboot of the Hellboy series-not number 3 in a trilogy of the 2004 & 2008 movies-with David taking over the title role. They do touch on his origin story a little, but not too heavily. It's based on the graphic novels by Mike Mignola and focuses more on the supernatural elements of the character and not so much on the super hero ones. Milla plays the Blood Queen, an ancient sorceress wanting to remake the world for demons-she also wants Hellboy/David as her King. Ian plays the man that adopted David and raised him and tried to instill good qualities into him. Daniel plays an agent for the B.P.R.D.-the good guy's organization they work for that fights evil-and Daniel has secrets of his own. The creatures throughout the film all look creative-they don't always look like what you normally see. If you are familiar with the books-I'm not, but I like the movies-you probably know a character named Lobster Johnson. He shows up in sort of a cameo role and is portrayed by Thomas Haden Church. As the end credits start, there is a scene and then there is also one after the end credits.
It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence and gore and language and has a running time of 2 hours.

50,XweAponX,Hopper does Hellboy,10,15 February 2020,"I understand some of the complaints about this film. But it still doesn't deserve the universal panning it got.David Harbour's Hellboy, to me is as much Hellboy as Ron Perlman's. I loved both.But where the first Hellboy movie from Guillermo Del Toro was kind of like a magical fantasy romance, this take on Hellboy gets right into the monster fighting. And we have some great monsters here, including mr pig-head (Gruagach- Stephen Graham), who was so over the top it made Hopper's Hellboy look tame.First we have a vampire, then we have to fight ""allies"" and giants, and then here comes Baba Yaga's house, looking exactly how I imagined it would, walking around on to spindly legs. I had been hearing that story since I was a kid, and now I got to see it.I thought Milla Jovivich's Nimue was overly bloated, but this story was mostly based on the comics. So having a character being acted in a very much comic fashion was appropriate.I don't know what arguments happened between Del Toro and Mignola, it was sad that that friendship was burned over this film.But I really like this totally different take on Hellboy, Ian McShane's Dr. Bloom is a lot like John Hurts, while being considerably different at the same time. Ian's bloom was more of a warrior than a scientist but still had the knowledge. But the big surprise was Daniel Dae Kim as Ben Daimo, and his secret. And Sasha Lane's ""Alice"", and her little side story.I admit I like the first two Hellboy movies more, but I think this one deserves a sequel, regardless of how it is perceived. I think that's what the idea was, but not after getting attacked by every major newspaper in the country. But I've seen worst movies than this being critically acclaimed. And this Hellboy is more like what I expected the first one to be like. I think this version is more true to the characters.",Hellboy
51,alindsay-al,A Below Average Messy Film,4,18 April 2019,"I haven't seen the original Hellboy films for a long time but I was mildly excited for this film due to some entertainment in the trailers, but I was worried that the trailers had shown too much and unfortunatly I was right. The premise of the film sees Hellboy bought in to help stop The Blood Queen from bringing back the Apocalypse. David Harbour takes over the role of Hellboy and does a really good job in this film, it is just a shame the rest of the film is a mess. He is very quick witted and snappy with quite a few good jokes. He looks amazing with the prosthetics and really does a good job of selling the action scenes. The supporting cast though doesn't perform as well, Ian Mcshane plays his father in the film and honestly he could have been played by anybody I like the actor but he had nothing to work with in this film. You are meant to care about their relationship but I never did even when the film really wants you too. Sash Lane plays Alice but her character never really interested me, you are meant to believe in this friendship between her and Hellboy but they never give you a particularly good reason to care about this friendship and again it hurts the overall film. Daniel Dae Kim plays an M11 agent that has to work with Hellboy and he is a pretty generic character, the military guy who doesn't trut Hellboy, yeah you can probably work how that is going to go. The one thing interesting about his character is spoiled in the trailer and isn't explained at all in the film. Mila Jovovic plays the Villain The Blood Queen and she is so bad it is funny, the dialogue for her is just terrible and she really is one of the most boring antagonists of all time. The story is pretty much non existant, there is nothing interesing or unique about the plot in this film, basically the plot is an excuse to get as many over the top violent action scenes and has depth whatsoever, especially with all the plot points being heavilly promoted in the trailers. The script has actually quite a bit of funny dialogue in it that made me chuckle, Hellboy is a pretty funny guy in this film and it definitley helped the film. However, as mentioned the films drama just doesn't hit for me and I didn't really care about anything that happened in this film. The style for the film has some pretty entertaining action scenes especially in the first part of the film. Some of the visceral scenes do work and feel appropriate for the film but I cannot stand how much unnecessary violence there is in this film. I don't mind violence but it has to have a point and this film honestly has so much pointless over the top cartoony violence it hurts. Overall this film is a mess with plenty of idea not executed well. Seeing how much money it has made in the Box Office I think it is fair to say we won't be seeing a sequel to this film anytime soon.",Hellboy
52,CubsandCulture,On its own merits it is mediocre. As a replacement for Del Toro it is hot garbage,4,25 July 2019,"I am not sure why the studio tried to reboot this franchise. Del Toro's film are really beloved but didn't really do well at the box office. I think it would have been better to cancel the whole thing once Del Toro walked. Regardless, the final film is a mess. There was no less than 3 clunky exposition sequences for origin of various plot points. Several character motivations are underdeveloped or do not makes sense. Worse the film's bloodletting stands at odds with the dark whimsy that the film seems to be going for. (Likewise, the random vulgarity in the language is off-putting). I don't think the film is fully understandable if you haven't seen the Del Toro films. There is still a major character who I have *no idea* where she (I think a she) comes from.On its own this wouldn't be so bad as the film has a lot of visually striking and narrative inventiveness. That character I don't understand at least looks cool and her sequences are effective. The problem is the studio *clearly* recycled some of the Del Toro concept work. Del Toro has design thing about eyes where eyes are in the wrong place or being damaged in crude ways is a common motif in his work (i.e. the Pale Man in Pan's...). The motif is present here. Likewise, many of the creatures' otherness looks like something Del Toro would do. Add in some narrative bits of shorthand the film uses from the first two films and this film does not have a separate existence. The thing is the new director is not Del Toro and he doesn't do a good job copying. It feels closer to parody than anything else, but unintentional and not funny. The studio should have insisted a greater break from the other films.Strangely enough Hellboy the character is the best part of the film. He is written exactly right and while Perlman is a better fit the new guy is more than able substitute.",Hellboy

Due to preposterous plot, half cooked character development and lackluster acting by most of the characters this movie is a dull despite of lots of violence and gore.The movie starts with an interesting flashback and gives you a glimpse that you going to witness another funfilled joyride but the expectations starts crashing as the movie progress. The movie had some interesting sub plots which starts igniting the interest in the movie but as soon as you interest starts developing you gets served with action.The acting department is saved only by Harbour and McShane and they were atmost loyal and dedicated with their job. Jovovich in the role of a menacing queen is major disappointing. There were lots of expectations from her character but doesn't quite brings it. Dim and Lane were also average.Screenplay of the movie is uneven and despite of lots of violence and gore the movie the movie can't keep you hold for long.

57,lukem-52760,"A VERY GOOD,GORY AS HELL & DARKER VERSION.",7,21 August 2019,"I really liked the new ""Hellboy"" as director Neil Marshall has created a much more gruesome & more horrific HellBoy movie.
I still prefer the Del Toro movies & i still much prefer the excellent Ron Perlman as Hellboy but this new version is still very good & David Harbour was actually good as a new version of Hellboy himself, there was still humour but i did long for Perlmans iconic voice & mannerisms, but harbour done a good job, just not as great as Perlman but that being said i still got into this Hellboy.
David Harbour is a quality actor as we've all seen with his fantastic performance as Cheif Hopper in the Amazing series STRANGER THINGS, I'm a Harbour fan now & he definitely done a good job here as Hellboy & really enjoyed the movie & it's a darker take on the Hellboy character & his world.No one could ever replace or better Ron Perlman as Hellboy though, his performance was fantastic as he became Red & he became the type of guy/demon you wanted to hang out with, Ron was hilarious & ridiculously convincing as the big Red that Hellboy became Ron Perlman & Ron Perlman became Hellboy lol it was one of those greatest Casting bits that become the stuff of Hollywood legend like Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, that type of casting perfection.This version DEFINITELY was more on the Horror side as Del Toro's films were more fantasy, i loved the darker & more blood soaked style & it's more sinister tone as it separated it from the previous films as it should, as this is Neil Marshall's Hellboy.The monsters look Amazing, i mean of course there's c.g.i overload just like every comic book film but there's still alot of old school practical FX too & some of the creatures designs are fantastic & scary.
The sets & production design is absolutely stunning & some or similar to Del Toro's but that was fine as it felt familiar but the standout set for me was the beautiful old fashioned trophy heads room, it looks amazing with so much rich detail.
The cinematography is very good & very sharp as everything is richly textured on screen, some great scenes looked like a twisted nightmare it was great.
I like Neil Marshall, he's made some excellent films such as Dog Soldiers, Doomsday & The Descent, he knows Horror & Gore well & seems to create a really interesting & scary Horror world in his films.Take this like i did the new ""Ghostbusters"" which i genuinely loved, this is just a new vision of the characters & franchise, so let it stand on it's own as it is a wild & bloody monster movie full of fantasy & Horror!!!

58,Pairic,OK but Del Toro's version was better,7,30 April 2019,"Hellboy (2019): In a pre-credits we visit Pendle Hill in 517 CE as KIng Arthur pulls a fast one on Nimue the evil Blood Queen (Mila Jovovich) and chops her into pieces ala Monty Python, her head still venting spleen as it is sealed in a casket. Her body parts are then dispersed. In the present day Hellboy (David Harbour) goes to Mexico in search of Agent Ruiz who disappeared whilst hunting Vampires. Sadly Ruiz has been turned and morphs into a Werebat style Vampire. Recalled to the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) HQ by it's Director, his adoptive father Trevor Bruttenholm (Ian McShane) he is sent to England to assist the Osiris Club, a group which performs similar functions to the BPRD. They are hunting Giants which have been raised from the earth. Meanwhile a Werehog Fairy, Gruagach (Stephen Graham) is gathering the parts of Nimue, intent on reassembling her and reactivating her powers. Nothing goes quite to plan for anyone and Hellboy soon joins up with a Psychic, Alice (Sasha Lane), whom he had saved from the Fairies as a child and Major Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim) of M11 to battle Gruagach and Nimue.This is a reboot of Hellboy based on the comic books Darkness Calls, The Wild Hunt, The Storm and the Fury, and Hellboy in Mexico. A vein of dark humour runs through the film but it is also replete with bleak scenes. People are dismembered, decapitated, eaten by giants. Gruagach slays monks and rips out the tongue and voice box of one to use to chant a phrase. Ectoplasmic representations of the dead are summoned up by Alice, emanating from her mouth. The Osiris Clu is based in a country mansion, with panelled, book lined walls which naturally have secret doors. The M11 HQ hides behind a Fish and Chip shop front. Hellboy discovers some secrets which his father has kept from him and muses over how monsters are treated. There are many good scenes in the film but it all seems episodic and the whole is less than the sum of it's parts.

61,masonsaul,Bad reboot,4,13 April 2019,"Hellboy is a bad reboot. The CG is good in a few brief places but it's awful most of the time. Sasha Lane, Milla Jovovich and Daniel Dae Kim all give bad performances. The film looks cheap and has a bad sequel bait ending. It's also surprisingly boring in the middle with too much reliance on exposition. It's got some bad tonal shifts and a truly misguided way of having the dead come back as ghosts that is disgusting. However there are some positives. David Harbour is a good Hellboy and some of his jokes are funny. There are two really good action sequences that are well filmed and I liked the soundtrack. Overall, it's a bad reboot and Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy films are much better.",Hellboy
62,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Fun, Dark, Comic Book Film",7,14 April 2019,"I was intrigued to check this film out as I enjoyed the Guillermo Del Toro version and though it was fun. When I heard this one was going to be hard R, I figured they would be able to ramp up the horror more which is something I'm always down for. I was also interested when I heard that David Harbour would be playing Hellboy, as I'm a fan of him from Stranger Things. The synopsis is Hellboy is caught between the worlds of the supernatural and the human, battles an ancient sorceress bent on revenge.We kick off back in the dark ages in England. It is stated that King Arthur (Mark Stanley) was real. The armies of man are fighting against the supernatural. With him is Merlin (Brian Gleeson), his wizard, as they go against its queen, Nimue (Milla Jovovich) the Blood Queen. She is defeated and her body is cut into pieces. They are sealed in boxes that only a priest can open and hidden around the United Kingdom.It then shifts to the present. We are in Tijuana where Hellboy is looking for a colleague. We hear his father, Professor Broom (Ian McShane) telling him to forget about the agent and to come home. Hellboy was friends with him and wants him back. It turns out though that the vampires Esteban Ruiz (Mario de la Rosa) was investigating got to him.When Hellboy returns to their base, he learns of his next mission. He is going to England to help out an order as they hunt giants. Things aren't really as they seem though. They reveal Hellboy's past and how he came to be with Professor Broom. They also tell him the legend of Nimue. Along the way, behind the scenes, a creature is collecting her pieces to bring her back. The creature wants his revenge against Hellboy, but Nimue has other plans for him. It involves waking up his true nature and revealing the truth of his past.Now I will admit, coming into this film I heard mixed things about it. Some liked it and others were complaining about it. This film was exactly what I thought it was going to be. It feels like an R rated, big budget, horror, comic book film, which is exactly what Hellboy is. There were some things that I really liked that they did with it too.The first thing for me was that I liked that they incorporated the myth of King Arthur into this. Now I've never read any of the comics so I don't know if they have it in there or it was just used for this film. I think this is really interesting though, because it gives perspective to certain things that could happen. Going from that, we really get the concept of self-fulfilling prophecies. No matter what people in this film say or try to do, they could be pushing Hellboy to fulfill his prophecy. It makes you wonder if he still would or you are not giving him enough credit to do the right thing. I dig this idea.Something else with this film is the reason that Nimue wants to destroy humanity. Part of it is for revenge for what happened to her. That is completely understandable. She is angered though when she is watching television to see what we have become. I'm partially guilty as I love some bad reality television every now and then. It really boils down to humans are trash and we need to be wiped out. As horrible as it sounds, I can't really argue against her logic here.I really liked that in this version, they did away with the sappy love story. I get that we all want to find our one person, which is great. It really makes Hellboy whiney and I'm glad that it was gone. I actually think for this film, it tightens it up without it. Now Nimue has a plan for Hellboy, which is fine, but it is for much different reasons. I also liked that they briefly give us how Hellboy came into this world like in the previous version, which includes the Nazis, Grigori Rasputin (Markos Rounthwaite) and my favorite character, Von Krupt (Joel Harlow).This brings me to the pacing of the film, which I think is good. The film for being 2 hours, didn't really feel like it. We keep getting action and things happening which I'm a big fan of. The only issue I had is that there is something like three flashbacks to fill in back-story. I think it is good to show us things and not tell us, but it did get to be a bit much. This being a reimagining of the graphic novels, I understand why it was done to get us to speed with the lore. I thought the ending was good, it really reveals the character and nature of Hellboy. It does set itself up for a sequel if they want with some mid and post credits scenes.To the acting, I think that Harbour is solid as Hellboy. In the previous version and its sequel, I liked Ron Perlman. When I heard Harbour would take over the role, I wasn't worried. He shows enough of the sarcasm that you need for the character from Stranger Things and it played well. He did a fine job in this role. Jovovich was also solid as the villain. She seems menacing and it is an interesting role for her. It is not physically demanding like a lot of ones she's taken in the past. I thought that Sasha Lane who plays Alice Monaghan and Daniel Dae Kim as Major Ben Daimio were both solid. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed as well, with a special shout out to Stephen Graham who voices Grugach.Now to something I've been waiting to cover even while I was sitting in the theater. The effects of this film are mostly CGI. For those who know me, I love practical effects. We do get some of that. I thought the look of Hellboy was good and even the Hell King version was solid. There is a lot of CGI though. Some of it is really good, I will give it that. There were some really bad aspects to it as well. A good bit of this came from blood for sure where it wasn't good. There is just so much CGI in this. I came to expect it for sure. I will say that the film is shot really well though.The last thing to cover before wrapping this up would be the soundtrack of the film. It is used in some pretty creative ways actually. From the Rock you Like a Hurricane in Spanish to some other rock music used during fight scenes. I think it was used pretty well and I actually thought it helped out the film to match the feeling of the scenes.Now with that said, I had fun with this film. Do I think it is great? Not by any stretch. It actually has some deeper feelings in it that I wasn't expecting and I liked that. The story has some interesting concepts to it and the acting I thought was solid. The pacing of the film really moves along at a good clip with a solid ending. I don't think we needed as many flashbacks as we got though. There are a lot of effects, some good and some that are bad. The soundtrack of the film was solid as well. I don't think everyone will like this. If you like comic book films, I think you'll enjoy this as it really feels like a film like that. This just incorporates a lot more horror elements for sure. I do think this is a good film and it really is just fun.",Hellboy

64,robertemerald,Hellboy rocks,9,4 December 2019,"I can see where critics of this movie are coming from, but I don't agree. Fact is, we now have three superb Hellboy movies instead of just two, and all are really exciting, all are fantastic entertainment. I personally loved all the cgi in this movie. There's some awesome monsters, which were underused, particularly toward the end. But they are there, and that's a huge plus. There are some wizard ideas all through this movie, concurrent with the special effects, but, alas, there are also some rehashed nonsense about King Arthur. Why oh why? Has Hollywood not heard of Science Fiction and Fantasy booksellers? Why do they keep insisting that if they remake a classic we'll all love it more that something new? Spiderman movies might be huge at the box office, but they also appear just as massively at the second-hand shops almost as quickly. I only docked it a point for the King Arthur thing. In truth it allowed for some really awesome graphics. I just wished that that part could have been a new legend. David Harbour makes a great Hellboy, easily as charming, down to earth, wise-cracking and macho as Ron Perlman. His sidekicks are awesome two, each with very new powers that you won't have seen before in one, and the other is a great alternative that should have happened years ago. Milla Jovovich is brilliant as the bad guy, truly and supremely evil. Throughout the first half of the movie there are numerous classic rock tracks. It was awesome. From the middle though it turns over into high tension orchestration. I should dock a point for that, the irritating sense of first being carried along and tapping ones feet to the action, and then having that high dashed by the old fashioned again. As I want to encourage the first half approach, and seeing as this movie is just pure entertainment from start to finish, well, I'm pretty certain it deserves at least a nine.",Hellboy
65,guisreis,Hotchpotch with many ups and many downs,7,6 February 2021,"Kitsch dark-humour comedy-horror-fantasy-superhero hotchpotch adventure flick full of special effects and mythology revisionism. There are many ups and many downs, with the former overcoming the latter by a very slight margin. There are both funny or smart moments and tedious and formulaic ones. There are quite nice monsters but also very silly situations. While the battle in the beginning is amusing and suprising, the one in the final part is just videogame crap. To resume, the movie is quite irregular. Perhaps the good traits make it worth seeing. Perhaps... and not with great enthusiasm. The Arthurian opening scene may be seen as a metaphor of the whole film, being nice and ridiculous, well-done and B-movie, everything at the same time.",Hellboy
66,rgkarim,There is Hellboy To Pay,6,14 April 2019,"Comic book movies remain the big fashion of the era, utilizing big budgets to bring the world of literature to life in ways the fanbase never imagined. With DC and Marvel combatting for supremacy, the independent studios are still trying to work their way in and get some publicity themselves. The first two installments of this movie held their own charms, but are a little outdated and thus comes this weekend's flick in the form of a modern update of the dark, mercenary comic. Robbie K back with another review as we look at:Movie: Hellboy (2019)Director:
Neil Marshall
Writers:
Andrew Cosby (screenplay by), Mike Mignola (based on the Dark Horse Comic Book ""Hellboy"" created by)
Stars:
David Harbour, Milla Jovovich, Ian McShane
LIKES:Most of the Acting
Comedy
Action
Pace
Costumes
MusicSUMMARY:Hellboy requires some people ready to go in the darker parts of the superhero world, and the cast did a good job for the most part. David Harbour brings some new life to the role, bringing the sarcasm of Hellboy with some broader emotion than Perlman did a while back. Ian McShane does his work in the executive director role, playing that tough father figure that is always the guiding light to the demon's moral compass quite well. My favorite though was Sasha Lane, who took the complex role of Alice and unleashed it to its full potential of the awkward time in awkward circumstances. The chemistry between Harbour and the group is astounding, fun and much of the light in this wave of darkness.
Other factors that I enjoyed include comedy that is fun, well delivered lines and some semi-slapstick that left me impressed with the wit that was behind it. The laughs were used well, balanced in the grand scheme of the story without becoming the central focus, which I applaud. The action components also use the comedy to make for some more engaging fights, and Hellboy makes the effort to help keep action scenes dynamic and different. My favorite fight was the end battle, which held more of the adrenaline-fueled insanity that makes me fist pump in excitement. This action leads to a pace that works well in comic book movies, and Hellboy does not drag too long like some of the other super flicks have hit sometimes. In addition, the musical score manages to support and life to the mix as well, with both orchestral and regular songs to spice things up in their high energy fashion.
Yet, the biggest positive for me is the costumes and settings of the world. The makeup artists and CGI guys accomplished the goals of bringing 2-D images to life, crafting devilish monsters, nightmare inducing creatures, and savage creations that fit quite well in the hellion universe. Hellboy's cast of interesting characters are equipped to look the part, and while not consistent, they for the most part hold the attributes needed to make the world of Hellboy come to life. The various organizations and fortresses are crafted to represent the world as well, props, uniforms, and various other components that mirror the worlds crafted by the Dark Horse Comics authors and illustrators.DISLIKES:Mila Jovovich's character
Overdramatic Flair
The Story
The Lack of Focus
The Loudness
The Aggressive GraphicnessSummary:The acting was fine for the most part and Jovovich does a fine job acting as she always does. However, this character they crafted was not quite the same denizen of darkness I love in this series. This blood queen had some scarring moments, but she was not quite the threatening image I wanted to see unleashed in the film. Her direction was more overdramatic delivery and singular speeches rather than a well-built character for us to either love or hate. The result was a weaker antagonist to stand against for the nearly 2 hour run time. It's that overdramatic flair at other components that takes precipice, which takes away from the overall movie rather than add, the grandiose nature a little annoying at times.
In regards to the story, Hellboy is trying to cram a lot of arcs into a small run time, trying to take the mini-series approach without the mini-series time table. This rendition holds a lot of introductions into the world of the big armed demon, including father introduction, friend introductions, prophecies, rivalry establishment, and more. All these factors are rapidly developed, giving little time, obstacles, or suspense that these stories requires, leading to flat storytelling that held such promise. It's the lack of focus in these things that makes the movie okay, but not truly great.
Finally, the aggressive visuals and sounds may also be quite overwhelming given the preference of the audience. In regards to sounds, this movie is very loud, and those with sensitive ears will need to brings some barriers to reduce the impact of the cacophony of sounds that rush in to avoid ears ringing. Visual wise, again the movie's CGI group has applied their skills in the way fitting of a dark comic book series like this. However, they may have done too good of a job as the blood, gore, and sinew dribbles like rain in this movie. Hellboy's focus is very much geared towards filling the silver screen with as much maiming as possible, bringing some disturbing imagery to embed itself into your memory. Sometimes, this worked for me very well, but other times it was unnecessary, merely blatant attempts to raise the shock factor another few notches. If that's the kind of visuals you want in this kind of film, then you will want to flock to the theaters and catch it in high definition goodness.The VERDICT:Overall, Hellboy is not a bad movie as many have said, but it didn't deliver on the potential crafted in the trailers. Some good visuals, comedy, and fast paced action were good starts in terms of getting the comic vibe up, but the movie itself just doesn't have all the finesse it needed like the bigger studios have done in the past. We needed some focus on the story, some bigger suspense added to the mix, and more importantly finding that balance to extend the movie into a series rather than in one movie. Perhaps a series would be the next step to better presentations, but for now, this movie has a lot of special effects to make a theater visit worthy, but with other super hero films coming or still in theaters, you are best left to waiting or attending these.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 6.5
Movie Overall:: 5.5",Hellboy
67,vengeance20,Critics Have It All Wrong!,9,16 April 2019,"Having only seen the 2nd Hellboy film back in '08 & starting to see posters dotting about my local about this film I was partially intrigued. From checking on the net if a 3rd Hellboy film was to be in the making, I wondered if this film was it, but it turned out from a Facebook post, that it was a remake or reboot.Now, I'm no fan of the series, nor have I read any of the comics, but I kind of have an idea of what the story of Hellboy is about. So I went in to this from hearing that it was 15+, had adult humour & gore, along with some horror elements! Which is my main reasoning for going in along with seeing the 2nd Hellboy film!The film is set in England Great Britain, so that was pretty appealing I think. But the film as a whole was epic! I mean like I said, not a fan, but the film is an example of what the DC Films should be about! The film was violent, dark & sinister with some pretty insane horror visuals! The story was simple enough, Hellboy finding out his true power & stopping the Blood Witch from plaguing Great Britain & the whole world. Though a bit confusing in other areas. But then I'm not a fan so.Slight hints of feminism were kind of a let down. The film kind of dragged a bit & could've been shorter. But that's the only criticisms I have for this film.Overall I think those snobby, middle class critics have got this one all wrong! The film was entertaining & pretty good watch! It's rare to have a film of the DC Universe so violent & laced with adult humour! There needs to be more films like this one! I bet they would enjoy those crappy Avengers Films or films which aren't half as entertaining as this cos they're paid or bigotry to what the find great & want everyone else to follow like sheep! RT can go do one! 15% is stupidly low for a film that deserves a least over the 60% mark!Overall a great watch! 9/10",Hellboy
68,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Hellboy (2019)""- What have they done to you, Hellboy?!",2,19 April 2019,"It's always a delight when a film inspires such a visceral negative reaction in me, that I have to pause and ponder hard on the proper words to describe it. And that's definitely the case with 2019's ill-advised and utterly unnecessary reboot ""Hellboy,"" based of course on the comics created by Mike Mignola. It isn't enough to call this film simple phrases like ""poor"" or ""bad."" No, this movie almost necessitates the use of more colorful language. Words like ""cockamamie"" and ""nonsensical"" come to mind. As do words like ""asinine"" and ""abhorrent."" And most definitely ""abominable.""But, to keep it simple and put it in more tangible terms, yeah... it was pretty darned dreadful. Suffering an aimless narrative, a sloppy execution and a complete lack of the charm and artistry that defined the comics and prior film adaptations, this new take on the classic cult-character is a fundamentally broken mess of frustration and failed potential. And it can go straight to... well, you know where.Hellboy (David Harbour), a demon that was raised by humans to help fight supernatural threats, is called into action when the ancient and deadly Blood Queen Vivian Nimue (Milla Jovovich) is resurrected. Along with his surrogate father (Ian McShane), a woman from his past named Alice (Sasha Lane), and shape-shifting fellow agent Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim), Hellboy must stop the vile mistress from bringing about the end of the world. Along the way... a bunch of random, inconsequential stuff happens involving grouchy giants, vengeful pig-men, multiple secret organizations, a Mexican wrestling ring and a rather randy witch who evidently has a hairy tongue. But none of it really contributes much to the proceedings.Part of the great tragedy of this new take on the source material is that it had so much potential. Yes, we all know about the quite excellent prior film adaptations by cinematic maestro Guillermo del Toro. And everyone of course knows that the long-proposed third film was dropped in favor of this new adaptation. (And to this day, I will admit I am still a bit heartbroken over this.) But I was willing to give this movie a fair chance, because I love the character. And on the surface, the elements are all there. Director Neil Marshall has a great track record when it comes to the strange and the bizarre. The cast is oft-electrifying. And the visuals are frequently interesting. But it just does not work as a coherent film, to the point it becomes frustrating to watch. Everything about this movie just feels misjudged and mishandled.The writing is one of the chief offenders. There's no clear goal or logical flow to the story or characters. It's a slapdash amalgamation of disconnected and disparate components that don't fit together at all. A writhing mass of seemingly random subplots lazily peppered in around a ""central story"" that really only takes up about thirty minutes of the two-hour runtime. At times, it almost feels like multiple different scripts were somehow mixed together accidentally. Characters are often established, then immediately written out, leaving them pointless. Plotlines come and go on a whim. And the movie frequently writes itself into ridiculous corners that it quickly and lazily solves with contrived deus-ex-machinas, giving little satisfaction. And as a result of this aimless structure, even important facets of the story like the main villain (played well by the incredibly likable Jovovich) feel completely disconnected from the narrative! I'm sorry, but the writing is just nonsensical and it does not work.Adding to that is a general feeling of unease in the production. As I said before, the visuals are frequently quite fascinating to look at thanks to the wild world established by Mignola's comics. But that's not enough to save what is otherwise an incredibly shaky execution. It almost feels like director Marshall didn't know what to do with the material from day to day. It all feels very patchy and inconsistent. Some scenes are rushed to the point they become hard to follow and you miss out on key exposition, while others grind the story to a screeching and jarring halt, giving you a strange sort-of whiplash effect. At times the camerawork is wild and creative- see an early sequence involving Hellboy fighting off three giants which is arguably the film's best sequence... while other scenes are really amateurish and basic with poor framing and lazy setups. Much like the script felt like multiple screenplays that had been mixed together, the visual direction feels at times like it was handled by different people with very different styles. And combined with patchy editing and mixed-bag visual effects, this strangely inconsistent execution makes it hard to keep yourself invested.And to top off the trinity of troubles with this new ""Hellboy""... the movie just isn't anywhere near as creative or as charming as it ought be. The cast is great- particularly David Harbour, who makes the character of Hellboy his own. But the character isn't likable or interesting this time around. He's just a brash guy who occasionally makes bad one-liners. The same can be said for the other characters- nobody stands out, as everyone is just a bland, broad archetype. And despite the visual flourishes no doubt crafted by dozens (if not hundreds) of designers and technicians... it all just begins to look ugly and uninspired after a while. Gone are the beautiful minimalistic visuals of the comic. Gone are the exquisite and intricate designs of del Toro's films. This new ""Hellboy"" is just bland and ugly... inside and out.""Hellboy"" barely claws its way to a miserable 2 out of 10. It's a messy, unlikable slog. If you want to spend some quality time with the character, do yourself a favor and either pick up a few issues of the comic or revisit the excellent prior films instead. Because take it from this ""Hellboy"" fan... this movie is one hell of a disappointment.",Hellboy
69,fntstcplnt,Hellboy (2019),3,21 December 2019,"Directed by Neil Marshall. Starring David Harbour, Sasha Lane, Daniel Dae Kim, Ian McShane, Milla Jovovich, Alistair Petrie, Sophie Okonedo, Brian Gleeson, Penelope Mitchell, (voices) Stephen Graham, Emma Tate. (R)Reboot of the Dark Horse Comics half-demon superhero property, with Harbour taking over the titular, makeup-covered role from Ron Perlman. They're big shoes to fill (and an even bigger ""Right Hand of Doom""), but Harbour does a decent job; less successful is director Marshall replacing Guillermo del Toro, whose giddy touches of fascination, imagination, romance and humor are often absent here (or smothered by all the frenetic dumping of exposition and spraying of special effects). Plot is a bunch of swirling nonsense involving a nasty blood queen (Jovovich) from the era of King Arthur--even the narration pauses for a ""no, really, we're doing this"" nudge at this revelation--and is amazingly incomprehensible considering that it doesn't seem to be a script-by-committee (only one writer is credited, Andrew Cosby). Lots of CGI-assisted blood and guts, even more head-scratching claptrap; design gets the occasional inventive spark, but those moments are hard to appreciate when the restless pace keeps lurching from one bloated set-piece to the next. McShane's wry, grounding presence is always welcome, at least.34/100",Hellboy

[+34%]",3,28 July 2019,"Five-line Review: David Harbour does a fine job as the sly, wise-cracking Hellboy, but the script (by Andrew Cosby) is all over the place with negligible coherence. Director Neil Marshall, best known for his fluidic action set-pieces, barely delivers. In fact, the only time I felt like it was a Neil Marshall actioner was during the post-climax set-piece. The supporting cast is okay, but their characters lack depth and are most of them turn out to be plain CGI caricatures. If you are gullible enough to not have seen Del Toro's versions, chances are, you might find this gore/slug/goo/eye-popper fest marginally entertaining.Verdict: Hellboy? Hell NO!",Hellboy
71,Abdulxoxo,Very fun movie,7,25 January 2021,"Unlike the del Tor version, this movie feels like a comedy with action, rather than the other way round. This version of Hellboy uses humour as the basis of the film, then seems to work the plot around that humour. One of the sole reasons why this film is being considered a disappointment is because of the plot; and the way in which it has been edited. It's all over the place. The film jumps from scene to scene, from place to place, often without connecting the scenes together in any way. Characters can be in one part of the world, then almost immediately somewhere completely different. There are also some scenes which (although stylish) could be cut entirely from the film and make no difference whatsoever to the story. The key problem the movie has is that, the way it's been stitched together, it just doesn't make all that much sense. Another issue is the extent to which expository flashbacks are used to explain everything. When we move from the opening scene into present day I thought they were just going to ignore Hellboy's origin story, and everything that had happened to the world to this point. However, we do get to see Hellboy's origin, along with many more key moments only via flashbacks. The visual effects also don't impress; the CGI should have been better. What was actually happening in most of the action sequences was great. There's one awesome scene where Hellboy is fighting 3 giants. However, this whole scene was very obviously green screened, which did take away some of the spectacle. The same could be said about a sequence towards the end of the film, which could have looked incredible if only the visual effects had been better. One of the aspects I liked about this movie was the amount of blood and gore. The violence in this movie is creative in its extremity. Unfortunately however, often it went too far into cartoonish violence that it lost the impact that it needed to have.
Performance-wise; David Harbour did a great job in my opinion. He looked the part, and brought the attitude required for the role. The supporting cast however are less impressive. The soundtrack is good as it uses a number of rock songs to keep the energy levels up. Now of course, given the shoddy editing, not all the songs felt like they were placed correctly. However, despite all of the film's flaws, I genuinely had fun. I laughed consistently throughout; and at no point was I ever bored.",Hellboy
72,Troy_Campbell,"Almost so bad it's good, but ultimately just bad.",3,13 April 2019,"For years fans had been clamouring for Guillermo del Toro to be given the chance to round out his lovably offbeat Hellboy movies with a trilogy-closing instalment, but instead we're treated to a big pile of steaming reboot. Swapping del Toro's cinematic passion and artistic ambition for Neil Marshall's cartoonish bloodlust and blustering storytelling, this version tries to compensate for a lack of charm and inventiveness by leaning wholeheartedly into its adults-only take on the titular demon-hero. It doesn't work. This is two hours of crude plotting, joyless acting, deflating action and woeful dialogue. There's a slither of fun in the foul-mouthed insult-slinging, but there's limited mileage when the barbs rely so heavily on cursing and so little on wit. Marshall has proven with Centurion and his 'Blackwater' ep of GoT (S2 E9) that he can concoct exhilaratingly brutal action sequences, however he's hamstrung here by cheap CGI and an overemphasis on gore. Ironically, it's the sequel-teasing epilogue that boasts the most creative set piece. It's tonally confusing too, Marshall sometimes going full piss-take in pursuit of peak B-grade glory; but it can be hard to judge where the intentional irreverence begins and the subpar filmmaking ends. The latter seems to win out more often than not. I could write a novella listing the ridiculously bad aspects of this film but let me keep it to three of the worst: the Stephen Graham voiced CGI pig-monster Gruagach, a bizarre narrative link to the King Arthur fable, and, well, majority of the acting. David Harbour (Sheriff Jim Hopper in Stranger Things) appears tired as the eponymous anti-hero, Sasha Lane is irritating as his séance sidekick Alice, and Daniel Dae Kim huffs and puffs as frenemy Major Daimio. Ian McShane and Milla Jovovich have a bit of fun hamming it up as Hellboy's pop Professor Bloom and the villainess Blood Queen Nimue respectively, although even they struggle to spit out some of the sillier lines - of which there are plenty. Sporadic moments of enjoyment sprinkled throughout an otherwise dreadful comic-book adaptation, Hellboy teeters on the edge of being so bad it's good, but ultimately is just bad.",Hellboy
73,muamba_eats_toast,Completely ridiculous from beginning to end,4,11 April 2019,The first half hour I was thinking it's not as bad as what I've read with it being rather basic but somewhat humorous but the plot holes got bigger the story more and more ridiculous to the very end. The humour tired as constantly swearing and being sarcastic doesn't last for 2 hours. Atleast half hour to long and with a horrific story and script a real shame considering how much I loved the originals. Equally as bad a reboot as Tom Cruise's the mummy if not probably worse.,Hellboy
74,saptesh786,Hellboy and Blood Queen !,6,16 April 2019,"This is rebooting of Hellboy chapter. All the cast have been changed here within story too. Only some basics are stayed unchanged. The new addition of Blood Queen was a good attraction, which we can see link at the starting at the movie, but unfortunately it takes a long time to come into the story even such 2 hours long movie. Moreover this very interesting plot is not developed properly. It could have been more enjoyable and climax may be better with fighting to Blood Queen. But movie fails here and loose its charm by finishing her part very quickly. There are also lots of ugly and gruesome scenes everywhere in the movie like ugly witches, ugly demons, man eater giants etc. One can feel illness after watching such nasty scenes. It might be avoided. At acting department the hellboy is just okay as he has hellboy mask and nothing to express on stony face except huge action scenes. Ian McShane did remarkable acting as Hellboy's father. Milla Jovovich has not sufficient footage to develop as blood queen. Another attraction is Sasha Lane she is perfect in her role of Alice smart acting too ! Overall movie is just watchable at once and not much recommended.",Hellboy

Ian Mcshane was great as usual (although he's in for it in the next John Wick movie). Milla Jovovich? How do I luv thee!!I really liked how they dove into who HB is and how he came to be.

76,rockman182,Hellboy (2019),6,14 April 2019,"I think most people would have preferred a third film in the Guillermo del Toro directed Hellboy series but we can't always get what we want. Even then I think they could have just continued on the series but a reboot it was with Neil Marshall at the helm. Marshall made waves with The Descent but hasn't really done a lot of note since then. While I don't think this film is as bad as people have been saying, its still not very good and pales in comparison to its predecessors which were able to do it better.The film shows our favorite half demon, hornless superhero fighting forces of the underworld. An ancient sorceress returns and wrecks havoc after being locked away and Hellboy recruits a team of companions to stop her before the world is taken over by her forces of evil. Ian McShane who is ever excellent also co stars. My favorite part is the inclusion of Sasha Lane who I loved in American Honey. I hope to see her in much more in the future.The film looks nice most of the times. Its much more bloody than its earlier entries which may please fans. Some of the monsters, especially the ones towards the end have nice unique designs and feel and look terrifying in all honesty. Then again we have the morphing into a CGI jaguar which looks appallingly bad. I'd say overall the design for characters is good but sometimes the effects are bad. I don't mind the comic relief or David Harbour as Hellboy but the story has too many set pieces which causes a loss of interest.The film lacks the magic and mysticism of the universe that del Toro created. The film feels soulless at times and doesn't excel at making an impact. I also have King Arthur/Excalibur fatigue, especially because Kid Who Would Be King just came out. Overall, I can see the effort made by Marshall but this reboot may not have been necessary. I don't know the comics or this universe well enough to understand what the post credit scenes meant as well.6/10",Hellboy
77,jon.h.ochiai,"""Hellboy"" is a Mess. Too Bad.",6,16 April 2019,"In Director Neil Marshall's spirited action fantasy ""Hellboy"", adoptive Father Professor Broom, played with whimsical gravitas by Ian McShane tells his Son, ""I wanted you to be the best you..."" David Harbour's Hellboy, the hulking prosthetically horned, red skinned beast, acknowledges his Father's love in tears. No spoilers here. After all, Dad is human. Hellboy, well he's some other distinction.The dramatic arc resonates genuine poignancy. Yet, seems so out of context, like much of ""Hellboy"". ""Hellboy"" often gets lost in the narrative abyss. Based on Mike Mignola's source material - Dark Horse Comic Book ""Hellboy"", Neil and Screenwriter Andrew Cosby reboot the beloved 2004 movie starring Ron Perlman as a narrative quandary. David Harbour embodies irreverent sense of humor and charisma in wonderful homage to Ron Perlman's Hero beast.But like I told my buddy Ron, after we both watched the movie, ""That was all over the place."" Euphemistically, ""Hellboy"" is an unfocused mess. WTF? Too bad. Not just for us, but also for the cast. Beautiful commanding Milla Jovovich is beguiling evil as The Blood Queen, Nimue. Hers along with David's Hellboy inspire strong performances from feeble material.In the prologue set in 1540 or so: Omniscient sorceress Nimue prepares to unleash her deadly plague on the world; thus, ending humankind forever. However, she's vanquished by stalwart King Arthur, played by Mark Stanley, and sorcerer Merlin, played by Brian Gleeson. To dissipate her immense power they literally chop Nimue into pieces, foreshadowing Neil's macabre resurrection visual, and bury her parts at the ends of the Earth.Hellboy works for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) fighting the ""dark forces"" like Giants. He's a superhero of sorts. He has great speed, strength, and fighting skills. He also possesses a huge mysterious metallic right hand.Professor Broom and Hellboy work together at the BPRD. He virtually raised his son there. Returning from a mission, Broom gently grooms the horns on his son's brow. As corny as that looks, it's sublime. Regardless of blood, they're family. They love each other unconditionally. That is the singular saving grace of ""Hellboy"".Eventually, conspiracy consumes. Predictably, the evil Nimue returns from wherever, and seeks revenge. Surprisingly, she seeks Hellboy as well. Although, handsome is not Hellboy's strong suit, Nimue is passionately drawn to the muscular red beast. Perhaps, it's his wry sense of humor? Maybe, it's Hellboy's lineage according to eerie villain Lady Huttom, who reprises Hellboy's origins and discovery by Professor Broom.Meanwhile, to save the world from Nimue's apocalyptic intentions, Hellboy joins forces with Alice, played by young spirited Sasha Lane, and soldier Major Ben Daimio, played by calm strong Daniel Dae Kim. It's on!The bond of Hellboy and Nimue make ""Hellboy"" watchable, which isn't saying all that much. David and Milla have engaging chemistry. They're both strong, resilient, and don't take themselves too seriously. On the other hand, ""Hellboy"" does. Rather at times Neil Marshall doesn't have a clue what kind of story he wants to tell.The visual effects in ""Hellboy"" are spectacular. Gruesome images of shredded and exploding flesh populate the screen. Then there are whimsical visuals of the Nimue's limbs sown back together or some vicious Giant swatting Hellboy like an insect.""Hellboy"" occurs as a funny, bloody narrative mess. Not in a good way. Again, too bad for David Harbour and Milla Jovovich. Really, too bad for us.",Hellboy
78,phanthinga,I can sense the cult status out of this movie,5,14 April 2019,"I love bad movies and so bad it's good kind of movies and if the mainstream critics hate a movie to death then I know that movie definitely right up my alley so it no surprise to me that Hellboy (2019) a movie with a lot of buzz in the industry for the wrong reason recently is a dumpster fire that I can't help but enjoy for how unapologetically edgy, over the top and dumb it is. The story is bad, the characters are unbearable, most of the time I can't see what the hell going on because the movie is badly lit plus the CGI looks like it straight out of the early 2000s with stuff like The Mummy, Van Helsing. I really want to see the third movie from the original trilogy that directed by Guillermo del Toro and starring Ron Perlman so if more people go and see this movie someday it may happen so I highly recommend Hellboy (2019)",Hellboy
79,RforFilm,Smells like fire and brimstone...oh wait; It's Hellboy and it's numerous missteps,4,17 April 2019,"I was in college when I saw Hellboy II: The Golden Army with friends and I was blown away by it. Though I'm not sure if it was the first, it was certainly the first in my book that I saw an awesome combination of fantasy and the superhero genre. I didn't see the first movie. I think it had to do with my original perception that the idea was just too weird. I'm not sure what got me to see this (it might have been Comic Con or something else), but enjoyed the excellent special effects, the feeling that the fantasy elements fit in well, and Ron Perlman's perfect casting as the big red boy himself.I'm aware he's based off a Dark Horse comic and that it's been running for a while. I also heard that director Guillermo del Toro had wanted to get another sequel made, but it got canceled. It would make sense that another production company would want to come in and try rebooting it. While I've been an advocate in getting more original content in Hollywood, I am open to new interpretations. So let's see if the new reboot of Hellboy can spark that same fire.Hellboy (played by David Harbour) goes to Mexico to find a friend, only to find him a vampire, and being forced to kill him. Though told the world will end, Hellboy dismisses this and returns to B.P.R.D. headquarters where his adoptive father Trevor Bruttenholm (played by Ian McShane) assigns him to England. This turns out to be a Hunting Club who need his assistance in going after three giants as part of a tradition. Though he's ambushed by the hunters, he escapes and defeats the giants. He's saved by his father, but it's revealed that while gone, someone had stolen remains of an ancient witch named Nimue.Nimue (played by Mila Jovovich) is resurrected and seeks to use Hellboy to start the apocalypse. In order to find her, he's introduced to a young woman Alice (played by Sasha Lane), who has magical abilities, and an agent Ben (played by Daniel Dae Kim), who can turn into a jaguar. They attempt to capture Nimue, but fail to do so when she appeals to his frustrations on his own humanity and struggle being a part demon. Though Hellboy gets a chance to understand both Alice and Ben, he knows that he's vulnerable and fighting Nimue will take a lot of will power to stop her magic.As much as I hoped this movie would be fun, Hellboy feels like a product that wasn't finished before release. It has acting problems, story problems, editing problems, and even special effects problems. It's not a complete failure as there are some really good things here. One such is David Harbour as Hellboy. Though I'll miss Ron Pearlman, Harbour does a great job playing his crass and unforgiving personality that I rarely see from screen heroes. He seems like a guy you'd want to hear stories from at the bar he drinks from.None of that would have shined through without the makeup work, which also looked good. I'm sure the production was more tempted to use digital effects (I'll get to that), but it's nice to see that good old-fashioned prosthetics and time that brings this character back to life. Now only if he was in a better movie.The rest of the material ranges from okay to poor. The other actors, even Ian McShane and Mila Jovovich, aren't given much to do beyond yelling or looking intimidating. I can't blame this on them as they, along with a lot of characters, have little personality or development. Even when them movie forces this (they'll be moments where they just met and then their close in the next scene), it feels like either something was lost in the script or the editing bay. I'm guessing it was cut to try to emphasize the action and effects. The action itself is serviceable, but the R rating doesn't add much. It's one of those things where I forgot what I saw after I saw it. The effects, which are mostly digital, have a tendency to look fake or not rendered in time. Because of this, it feels like Hellboy is fighting a bunch of video game characters, similar to the climax of Justice League.I'll give this four Hellboy comics out of ten. At best, it'll service those that want some okay action and a good Hellboy himself. At worst, it lacks anything that memorable that can't compete with Del Toro's movies. Throw this into Hell and watch the originals.",Hellboy
80,bankofmarquis,Oh...hell no,4,14 April 2019,"HELLBOY?!? HELL NO!I would imagine that about 90% of my readership just got what they needed out of my review with that first line and have moved on. For the rest of you, I will now explain why this reboot of HELLBOY is now the ""leader in the clubhouse"" for worst picture of 2019.I was pleasantly surprised by the 2004 Guillermo del Toro helmed and written HELLBOY and was even more surprised by how good the del Toro written and helmed HELLBOY II: THE GOLD ARMY (2008) was. I think that this was because there was a driving force - and vision - from a true auteur and was a perfect combination of material and artistic staff - including Ron Perlman in the title role.This version of HELLBOY has none of that. No vision, no driving force and a ""B"" performance by David Harbour in the title role. It feels like what it is - a cash grab. I blame the studio who produced this film - Summit Entertainment - for ""going on the cheap"" on this one.First off, they tapped a ""B Movie"" Director, Neil Marshall to Direct this thing. He is known for such artistic successes as DOOMSDAY and THE DESCENT - horror flicks that were heavy on gore, short on characters and plot - and that is what he brought to this film. Why worry about characters, plot or any kind of engaging features (including Special FX) when you can show, yet again, a body getting torn apart and blood spurting all over the screen.The studio also skimped on the performers. Instead of Perlman, Selma Blair, John Hurt and Doug Jones you get David Harbour, Daniel Dae Kim, Mila Jovovich and a sleep-walking, just give me my paycheck, Ian McShane. It's like watching the ""road company"" of a Broadway show. While the actors are game (with the notable exception of McShane), they are ""B picture"" actors, much like the Director.And...much like the special FX. I knew, going in, that the early word on this film was not good, but that never stops me. I like to make up my own mind, so I thought I'd ""pony up"" for the IMAX experience to, at least, see the CGI and FX on as large a screen with as good a sound system as possible. I shouldn't have bothered, for the CGI and FX were mediocre (at best) and all the big screen and sound did was emphasize how low quality the CGI was.And...finally...the pacing of this film is problematic, at best. This is certainly a film that was written and edited within an inch of it's life for the ""short attention span"" audience of today. The prevailing theory was ""why linger on a plot or a character or a moment when we can quick cut to another body getting pulled in two and watch a plume of blood spurt out in a giant arc).""There are 2 scenes in the end credits to set up the next film(s) in this series. Films that I seriously doubt will be made. If they are, I hope they pump some more money into the budget and get a creative team with some artistic vision.A swing and a miss.Letter Grade: C (and I'm being generous)4 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Hellboy
81,kuarinofu,This movie is a lot to talk about (spoiler-free),5,13 April 2019,"First of all, this movie is a much better experience for new viewers than it is for the people who watched the first two movies. I think it plays different for the people who are more familiar with the comic and thus are used to its style, cause I've heard that it is more faithful to the material it is based on (haven't seen the comics myself). It is also important to note that this movie looks and feels like it was around 4 hours long initially (maybe even a series) and was heavily cut.
The plot in this is just a vehicle for character introduction,as it happens in many movies. This one handles it poorly. I'm ok with having a couple of flashbacks to fill me in on what's going on, but here they take around 30% of the movie combined. Besides this, the characters themselves dump a lot of expository dialogue. There is a couple of scenes where the characters do an actual real dialogue but it's not enough. A good story is told through character dialogue and interactions, not through simple exposition and tons of flashbacks. I know this was done for new audiences though. This way, we know who the characters are and where they came from, but we don't know their essence at all. So when they start to express themselves this is where it gets really confusing. This threads the whole movie as well.
Like Hellboy himself, one time he's talking about being a weapon, a misfit and that he has his own way. Yet people's attitude towards him is still unclear, people kind of know about him, but they never show any disgust or fear towards him, more like slight surprise (opposed to Del Toro's version, where it was clear). Fast forward to him gloriously killing humans left and right. The Queen's intentions were also unclear, she was never seductive or deceptive. This was so underplayed, they never make you doubt, believe her, because she has no clear motivation and she's not a character. This is when I understood that:
There are no character interactions or chemistry between them. This way, the plot just drives itself to introduce the non-existent characters through exposition and flashbacks, yet they still end up underdeveloped and don't play off each other at all. Seems simply bad? But no, not quite. There is one more important element here.
The style. Del Toro's movies are always rich with his style and ideas, the shine with it. The first Hellboy and the sequel were both audio-visually rich and stylish. The production design was probably divorced from the source material, but it had it's own style. This one either has no style and vision at all or was intentionally made to look this way. This shows everywhere, weird jump cuts, tonal shifts, out of place music tracks, questionable design decisions and more. It hurts much more if you're familiar with the first two movies.
What else is there? Humor? I watched this on Saturday night, the city's only IMAX wasn't even half full, yet there were some relatively young groups of people. I wasn't laughing just as everyone else. Maybe I can blame the dubbing for some of the bad jokes though. At times I caught myself thinking: ""wait, that was a joke, right?""
CGI quality ranged from free animation presets from YouTube to pretty well done ones. They probably didn't have enough budget so they've decided to spend more money on more important characters and scenes and make the less important ones ""watchable"". I mean, Gruagach was awesome and the giants were horrible.
The action was not only very shaky, it was filmed like a bad video game cutscene. They wanted to make it flow by introducing long shots with constant camera movement but this just made it so confusing at times I was unable to tell what is going on. The ending action scene actually made me yawn just because I was so uninterested in what was going on.
I didn't get used to the new Hellboy look yet as well, in some scenes he was looking like a dead guy, like a corpse of the Red Skull, but I guess this represents his comic look better? I don't know. His hair was also very weird. Can't say much about his personality since he didn't get much characterization here anyway. They do play the old ""father-son"" relationship and the adolescence drama but they forgot to tell the audience that Hellboy is supposed to be a kid (yet again, opposed to Del Toro's version). This is super important to know.
It looks like I'm just bashing on this movie, so I do want to say that I liked some of the stuff. Some practical effects in some shots were good and Baba Yaga was cool (liked her even more since I live in Ukraine and she is also a part of our folklore). Gore was a good thing to see in modern cinema, but at times it even felt too much. Also, some of the creatures were really cool, but I can't really say more since they fall under spoilers category.
Overall, this was either just an incompetent movie, or a faithful adaptation that tried to be more of a comic and less of a movie. I know that they've put in two post-credit scenes, but I was so bored I didn't feel like watching them. And seeing the response this movie gets, I don't think we will see sequels any time soon.
I really hope that it was intentionally made this way and this is what it should be...Then I can just say that I loved the first one much, much more.",Hellboy

86,msbreviews,Rating: C-,4,16 April 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Guillermo del Toro's pair of Hellboy movies were always pretty acclaimed by both critics and audience. So, if a reboot was in the works, it had to be way different from the originals or, at least, capable of separating itself from them. Neil Marshall's film is definitely distinct, but not in a good way. Sadly, this is one of the worst movies of the year, so far. David Harbour tries super hard to bring this story to safe haven, but his outstanding performance can't fight back all of the painfully long and repetitive exposition dumps, an editing worthy of a Razzie Award (if they had such a category), and cringe-worthy comedy bits.The trio of writers failed in almost everything. Even Hellboy, as a character, becomes a caricature of himself at one point. Milla Jovovich, who is not a bad actress at all, offers such an over-the-top display that only comes off as cliche, cheesy, and the complete opposite of menacing. Obviously, her extremely villainous script doesn't help. Sasha Lane (Alice) is the only one who actually portrays a likable character (excluding the protagonist) and delivers a compelling performance. Daniel Dae Kim is also good as Ben Daimio. Unfortunately, a talented cast is not enough to overcome the undeniable screenplay issues, which tells a convoluted story, filled with heavy exposition through annoying flashbacks (I lost count of how many there are).The rock'n'roll score doesn't always work, becoming uneven and making some transitions just weird. However, credit where credit is due, it does make the action sequences a lot cooler. There are some great action moments where Hellboy shines, but overall they are ruined by sloppy editing. Honestly, I don't know how Marshall can direct such beautiful one-take fights (or ""stitched one-take"" sequences, like one towards the end) and horribly edited ones in the same film, so many times. The visual effects disappoint as much as they impress, but Hellboy's makeup and costume are, at least, on-point. In the end, the story and the characters are the two pillars of any movie, and Hellboy fails to deliver a well-written and captivating adventure, as well as compelling characters.All in all, Hellboy is a huge misstep in Neil Marshall's filmmaking career and he's going to have to work hard to get another opportunity at a blockbuster. His film is already suffering losses at the box-office, which proves that the interest in the reboot of this franchise is not big enough to warrant a sequel. Admittedly, it has its good moments and David Harbour embodies his character seamlessly, carrying the movie for as long as he can. Nevertheless, a good cast and some occasionally cool action sequences are not enough to fight back writing issues, uneven soundtrack, cheesy comedy, heavy exposition dumps, and the worst editing I've witnessed this year, so far. It's a headache that most people might not find worthy of the price of admission...",Hellboy

The story, characterisation, editing, dialogues, performances all looked pretty messed up. The only thing it does pretty well is the cinematography and the action ; that's it. The stylised shots along with a great set up made the film at least bearable. The story has massive connective issues all throughout! The editing seems like a hurried mess. The build up of all the characters was so bland that we couldn't really care about any of them. And nor the actors cared much either. Only saving grace was the Action, where it didn't disappoint. I enjoyed the gore and violence it gave huge importance to. It is made for a very specific type of audience who would enjoy a slasher, gory, violent film. But for the most of us it would be a film to forget.",Hellboy
90,0w0,This movie should burn in hell forever...,3,27 August 2019,"This movie is an insult to the entire franchise and a testament to the greed of Lionsgate Studios AND a spit in the face of Guillermo del Toro, who built this franchise up with his love and imagination, only to see it all come crumbling down at the hands of Lionsgate and the others who financed this dumpster-fire of a movie. This movie has tarnished the franchise so badly, that I doubt Guillermo del Toro would even want to make a 3rd Hellboy film now, because people would associate this mangled-mess of a film with his 3rd film... And this is why we can't have nice things: Corporate greed... and Lionsgate.",Hellboy
91,MrDHWong,Stands among the ranks of 2015's Fantastic Four as one of the worst reboots ever made,3,26 September 2019,"Hellboy 2019 is a dark fantasy film based on the comic book series of the same name by Mike Mignola. Starring Stranger Things' David Harbour in the title role and directed by Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers), it stands among the ranks of 2015's Fantastic Four as one of the worst reboots ever made.After being summoned into the world from a Nazi ritual during World War II, Hellboy (David Harbour), a demonic creature from the depths of Hell, is raised by his adoptive human father Trevor Bruttenholm (Ian McShane) to protect the Earth from paranormal threats. One day, Hellboy learns that an ancient sorceress known as the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) has returned to wage war on the human race and create a new world fit for supernatural beings to inhabit. With time running out, Hellboy hurries to stop the Blood Queen while also questioning his own otherworldly origins in the process.Bland, flat, and pointless, Hellboy 2019 has no real reason to exist other than to fulfill some contractually obligated clause to renew the series licence. Even when no comparisons are drawn to Guillermo del Toro's films, this one still fails to distinguish itself as its own original entity. The entire time I was wishing this was the third entry instead of some cash-grab reboot as there was at least some potential to be found somewhere in all of this.The inconsistent choppy editing wavers the film's tone as it lurches from in-depth expositional scenes to awkward unfunny moments of comic relief, and in doing so, it is near impossible to feel involved in the story. Unlike the two preceding films, this one piles on the blood and gore significantly, as bodies are ripped apart and skin is flayed from bones. Instead of making the film seem more ""mature"" it does the exact opposite and comes across as a desperate attempt to look edgy to modern audiences. In addition to this, the CGI looks terrible, with some characters looking like they were conceived with PlayStation 2 era graphics. This will age the film horribly in a matter of years, unlike del Toro's films which still look fairly good even after more than fifteen years.David Harbour does his best with the material given to him in the lead role as Hellboy, not quite matching the charm of Ron Perlman before him but enough to at least have something interesting to guide us through this mess. However, the same cannot be said for every other supporting character as they all felt underdeveloped and one dimensional, in particular Milla Jovovich's Blood Queen, who is yet another boring world domination-seeking villain.To top everything off, the filmmakers have the nerve to sequel-bait its audience as though they're confident anyone would bother sitting through something like this again. Do yourself a favour and watch del Toro's films instead. Some parts may seem a little dated by today's standards but they're still way more entertaining than anything else this has to offer.I rate it 2.5/10",Hellboy

The soundtrack is punchy and punk rock. At last, the Computer Generated Imagery is globally successful. For now: that's heavy! Nevertheless, the story is so predictable and terribly far-fetched. In short: desperately annoying. It's really an uninterrupted series of dismemberments, decapitation and eye-gouging delights during manifold battles against apocalyptic monsters. These scenes are strung together at a blistering pace for one disappointing purpose: make you forget an incoherent script full of moronic plot twists.

98,PyroSikTh,David Harbour is Great. Everything Else is Bad.,4,16 April 2019,"I'm not exactly well-versed on Hellboy comics (honestly, after this movie that will probably be where I go to next to get a fix), but to my understanding this film adapts two or three books right at the end of his story, which is an interesting choice to say the least. The film opens with a flashback to King Arthur and Merlin taking out Nimue, the blood queen. Ian McShane is usually great, but his narration here felt so mismatched, like he needed to liven it up a bit. Unfortunately this isn't the last badly narrated flashback of the movie, as we get another to fill in Hellboy's origin, and another (for some reason) to explain Major Daimio's backstory later on.The film from here meanders from one set-piece to the next, starting with Hellboy taking out a Vampire in Mexico, before going Giant hunting in the English countryside, then he finds himself under the care of Alice who had a run-in with a fairy and a changeling when she was a baby, leaving her with the ability to communicate with the dead (oh yeah, this is another flashback by the way, but at least with minimal narration this time). Daimio bursts in out of nowhere, they get into a fight with a pig-man called Gruagach (who just so happens to have been the changeling mentioned previously). The blood queen is reassembled, taunts Hellboy, they fight on a hilltop, and then meet again in a cathedral. All the while Hellboy wrestles with his destiny to bring about the apocalypse, and some vague racial subtext about the relationship between humans and demons. Merlin makes an appearance (oh yeah, another flashback here too), some people die, others hatch betrayals that never come to fruition...Yeah, there's a lot going on in this movie, and next to none of it feels relevant or important, and the movie rushes through it all to get to the next bit and squeeze it all in in a timely manner. So knock bad editing off your list.While you're at it, knock bad writing off your list too, in part for trying to squeeze so much in, botching transitions, and never committing fully to a tight and comprehensive story, but also for more surface-level faults; dialogue is atrocious. The narration is pretty bad whenever it appears, which I've already covered, but the same laws seem to apply to everything else spoken by a character. Interactions are soulless, full of exposition dumps, and any attempts at humour fall completely flat. It quickly becomes very obvious that 90% of the humour was added in later after test screenings maybe didn't go as expected.Thanks to this, the acting is pretty questionable across the board. I can't blame the actors for bad dialogue, but I can blame them for it being delivered badly, and it is. In fact the only two actors who I felt embraced the dialogue and managed to get something tolerable out of it were David Harbour himself, and Stephen Graham as Gruagach. Harbour really is the perfect replacement to Ron Perlman. In fact I would possibly go even further and say I prefered Harbour to Perlman. Harbour's Hellboy is younger, more impulsive, maybe a little more whiny, but way more badass and imposing at the same time. Graham is entirely voicework, but he puts everything into it, and his scouse accent really makes the words he's given pop. Gruagach was easily character of the movie for me. The biggest sin of the other actors though were the english accents. Oh god they were terrible. Why does the Asian dude sound like he grew up with the Tory elite in Cambridge? Sasha Lane at least tried to make her accent a little more accurate, but it was still bad. It's 2019, why are we still casting Americans as British characters?As we're on the subject of things I liked, I really liked the original direction they wanted to take the movie before all the reshoots and (potentially) studio interference. This isn't a colourful, cheesy take like Del Toro's movies were, this is darker, more violent, and closer to a horror movie than an out-and-out comic book movie. Visually the movie has it all and then some, with some pretty good cinematography, fantastic creature designs, and a perfect blend of CGI and make-up to create a look that's both fantastical and surprisingly realistic. Gruagach in particular is played by a guy in a suit for the most part, but resorting to CGI for when he speaks, and honestly I'm totally cool with that. It made the action scenes engaging as both fighters are obviously there hitting one another, while not looking cheap and dated when he needs to open his mouth and communicate. The designs of other fantasy creatures like Giants, Fairies, Gremlins, Trolls, and especially the myriad of demonic entities were great. Honestly I would love to see a Hellboy movie really embrace this element and go all-in. Give us the apocalypse, give us an army of these fantasy creatures. Unfortunately this movie basically just uses them as cameos for those familiar with the source material and doesn't actually do anything with most of them.By no stretch of the imagination is this movie a good movie, at all. It's bad to the core. The closest comparison I have to Hellboy is Suicide Squad. Hey guys, let's make a dark and gritty movie about these comic book characters, filled with violence and swearing and horror elements. Oh yeah, that's a great idea. A year passes and; That was a great idea for a movie, but maybe we should lighten it up a bit. Let's add in a whole bunch of badly-written jokes, let's reshoot half the movie and have so much material we can't actually fit it all in, and we need to make it look hip and cool so lets add loads of rock music. Hell why don't we just get the company that makes trailers to edit this film. They're basically the same thing, right?David Harbour is great. Stephen Graham is great. The general visual quality is great. The effects are great. Even the story itself had a huge amount of potential. Unfortunately everything else is just plain bad. The music is bad, the dialogue is bad, the writing is bad, the jokes are bad, the editing is bad, the pacing is bad, the character work is bad, most of the acting is bad. The movie is bad. I give it a 4/10.",Hellboy
99,Darth_Osmosis,"More like, ""What the Hell was that, Boy?""",6,16 April 2019,"It's a very tough movie to review, since I am not sure how to look at it.. It doesn't work too well as a reboot or as new ""origin story"" nor is it a satisfying adaptation of any one single Hellboy book(or storyline). It manages to have so many different things from Hellboy mythos in it, but mixes them up and generally doesn't stay too true to the source material(some aspects are more intact than others!) so it's a very mixed bag.. that is amplified by the fact that the movie itself feels more like a combination of scenes and set pieces rather a coherent story. Sometimes the jumps from scene to scene are very abrupt and fast, meaning it's hard to get invested or at times even truly follow the story! This also means there is no downtime, and no real buildup to scenes that should have it. The jokes are very hit and miss, but retain that Hellboy feel so it's okay. It could and should have been better, but it can be enjoyed as a fun ""B-Movie"" and in a way that's what Hellboy is supposed to be.. anyway it's very hard to see this getting a sequel, both cause it's not all that good and also cause they kinda threw everything at us and there is not much room for upping the stakes!",Hellboy

This spring has been a busy time for comic book adaptations. Back in March, Captain Marvel dominated the marketplace and became the latest member of the 1 billion club. A month later, DC's Shazam hit the scene and also performed well, earning enough money at the outset to warrant a sequel. Of course, Avengers: Endgame is right around the corner and poised to be a monumental cinematic event. Endgame is currently selling advanced tickets at an unprecedented rate that will shatter records. Whereas in the early part of 2019 there was a void in crowd-pleasing genre entertainment, audiences have a glut of options to choose from now. come out at bad time again like Hellboy II golden army because of dark knight got more gross of money then to Hellboy II sadly. i am pretty sadly this bombed sadly and will never get a sequel ever again if they did then they need to in proof it more.now getting to this movie is pretty good darker, R RATED, superhero movie i am tried of PG-13 kiddy superhero movies really like Disney owns the all world witch i am sick of it already i am feeling tried of superhero movies i needed something different in my month is bloody R RATED. i kept thinking if Hellboy II never come out sametime around like dark knight then it would never flop at all because i reckon they should released it like November or something like that something like this movie as well should of released it like later on not when the bigger movies like Shazam screw that garbage, screw Avengers jeez i am just tried have enough with marvel and DC comics. this solved everything for me because all time marvel and DC is just always PG-13 movies that's it we haven't got R RATED superhero movies for awhile apart from R RATED Netflix shows that were way better then Marvel that's coming out on theaters. Ron Perlman would be very disappointed at the way people are treating this movie simply because it is not his and Del Toro's. I loved it. The comics are satanic bloody monster violence and that is what this movie is in a nutshell.i thought David Harbour did a great job as Hellboy i didn't mind him as actor he is known for Equalizer, Suicide Squad, Sleepless, Stranger things, now to this i thought him as lead role is good. and i thought Milla Jovovich did okay but not her best role i seen better in Fifth Element, Resident Evil but in this nope i reckon her role is nothing special at all. i loved (Sasha Lane) Alice Monaghan she is Interesting i liked her character in this film. rest of characters (Ian McShane) Professor Broom who plays Hellboy dad. and story is pretty opposite to del toro Hellboy movie from first one. and i thought story is pretty good and it's fast pacing not slow film where you have to wait for it, it's full on and i can see Neil Marshall directing this movie i loved Dog Soldiers, wasn't huge fan of Doomsday, but it's not Neil who ruined movie, it's writers who written film wrong made it dumb look i understand theirs stupid things in movie but i can deal with it much more then another movies. i loved Centurion. but this is great R RATED Hellboy film witch original ones should been R RATED before but it ended up kinda of soft a bit but i liked this better off this was almost a horror movie. i reckon give it a chance to and go see it or else they won't make sequel i never saw a hellboy movie in theater i wanted to but this was a chance to go and see it, sometimes you have to trust your instincts not what people say because it becomes different opinion look if you biggest fan of Hellboy you always wanted new hellboy film here it is. story of this movie is a lot different then to original hellboy. but i won't spoil it because spoilers take away everything from movie even don't watch the trailers, just because people hate this movie or rating will say don't watch it at all doesn't mean you have to obey people just go and see movie and judge yourself whatever you like it or not.",Hellboy

104,stevenrotherforth,Hell of a mess!,4,20 August 2019,"Hellboy 2019When it was announced that the new 'Hellboy' movie was going to be a reboot and not the third chapter of Guillermo del Toro's vision,
I must admit I was disappointed.
But I soon warmed to the idea.
Despite loving Ron Perlman's take on Hellboy, the casting of David Harbour in the lead role was a good choice for the reboot and the supporting cast also looked promising so I began to look forward to what was to come.Sadly the creators of this 2019 refresh have missed the target by a country mile!
The R rating is evident from the first sentence spoken as F bombs are frequently deployed.
Blood, gore and violence is used for the sake of it and nothing onscreen feels earned.David Harbour does a fine job as the titular character but his charisma and likability can't save this mess of a movie.
I will admit that this film is by no means as bad as the internet will have you believe but...
And a big but it is!
This movie has some serious problems.
Firstly the storytelling has no cohesion. This is perhaps one of the worst edited films in recent memory.
The scriptwriters (if there was any) treat the audience like a bunch of morons. Let's just say exposition is the dish of the day.
Having the actors over explain everything makes for some pantomime worthy performances. Particularly from Milla Jovovich as the evil blood queen.
She actually cries out at one point ""Excalibur!""
To explain to the audience the importance of the sword swinging in her direction.
It is a given that Jovovich is no contender for an Oscar but here her performance really scrapes the barrel.
Ian McShane takes on the role as Hellboy's father Professor Broom.
McShane does what he can with the pitiful script but to be fair to all performances, even including that of
Milla Jovovich, there's not much to work with here.With only fifty million dollars to play with Director Neil Marshall has bitten off more than his budget can chew.
CGI is laughably bad. This movie is far visually inferior to the movie Del Toro made some fifteen years earlier.
Good CGI can't make a great movie but bad CGI can certainly break a bad movie and this is evident here.
I just don't understand what went wrong.
Neil Marshall is a supremely talented film maker.
Anyone who has seen his horror flick 'The Decent' or any of the episodes of 'G.O.T' that he directed will know this.
Once again I believe that too many chefs have spoiled the broth.
'Hellboy' is a muddled mess of a movie.
There's glimmers of promise scattered throughout but ultimately this is a film that fails to be
remotely memorable.
It's a film that's hard to like never mind love!",Hellboy

Guillermo del Toro who had written and directed the first two films was not involved this time round, and the movie which draws inspiration from the comic books Darkness Calls, The Wild Hunt, The Storm and the Fury, and Hellboy in Mexico is poorer without his input. It's still a lot of fun though, which despite being deprived of key creative components sees Hellboy being called to the English countryside to battle a trio of rampaging giants, and then attempting to save the world after discovering The Blood Queen, Nimue (played by Milla Jovovich, Resident Evil series), a resurrected ancient sorceress thirsting to avenge a past betrayal.

106,Magow-Intermean,Hellboy Review,7,12 April 2019,"When an ancient sorceress wants to take down the world, our only hope is a warrior demon from the depths of hell itself.
Hellboy (David Harbour) is raised by his adoptive father Professor Broom (Ian McShane) to work alongside humans in the Bureau for Paranormal Research (BRPD) - an organisation that protects people from otherworldly forces who threaten the planet. Hellboy's supernatural abilities are put to the test when the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) is raised from the undead, in a bid to take revenge on humans who tried to destroy her ages ago. Neil Marshall's reboot of Guillermo Del Toro's two films based on this comic-book universe aims to set itself apart with a distinctly gory, and expletive-laden tone. Marshall understands how to stage large scale action set pieces, and there are a couple of sequences that are disturbing, yet hilarious. But there's little else of note.Milla Jovovich as the villain is bad, and not in a cheesy yet enjoyable manner. She struggles to convey the required sense of menace; her dialogue delivery fluctuates between wooden and comical. It also doesn't help that the Blood Queen is a weak antagonist who holds a lot of promise but doesn't quite bring it eventually. Meanwhile, David Harbour is perfectly cast as the lead character. Hellboy is mighty while being snappy with oodles of wit, and Harbour nails down his devilishly fun persona. Ian McShane also attempts to add some pathos to the distorted father-son relationship Professor Broom shares with Hellboy.Sadly, as soon as you begin to appreciate these sub-plots, the next action sequence is thrown at us. The tonality is wildly uneven which isn't helped as outrageous characters enter the narrative with little context, and often exit quickly as well. If Marshall's mere intent was to shock you with excessive gore and expletives, then he manages to do that. It isn't quite enough, especially if you leave the theatre confused about what just happened, due to a ludicrous plot. Despite McShane and Harbour's best efforts, this exhaustive 'end-of-the-world' story is unable to raise as much hell as it should.",Hellboy
107,thomasjay-2201,This would be screened in hell,4,12 April 2019,"Utterly atrocious, and that quite frankly is all you need to know. It tries so much and manages to fail with pretty much everyone hence why I'm struggling to remember what, exactly it was that just occurred over the past 2 hours or so. We get an origin and what seems to be 7 or 8 different 'stories' wrapped into one single runtime which gives nothing worth consuming. The charm of the Del Toro double had been ripped off and it's now completely soulless. Seemed to be made for 3D with countless moments intended to be popping out of the screen but even that wouldn't have saved this. The gore is unjustified and quite frankly appalling with the quality being embarrassing for a professional standard if you can call it that. To an extent the look works well and felt at times like a living page of a comic but that wore off after about 15 minutes into literal shadows which might've been an attempt to cover the shocking film assembled. Also the editing was ridiculous and so jarring at times it was completely shattering taking further away from the film. The finale baiting for a sequel with the introduction of Abe Sapien and the follow up post credits scene featuring a mysterious conversation with Baba Yaha were so long and the credits between were the longest I've ever possibly sat through. Ultimately it's not worth your time and if you do wish for Hellboy or something of that Ilk the first 2 are perfectly fine, there's a number of animated features and probably a million other, similar to the character only of better quality.

108,jamiedarlow-37510,Insanely gory and hugely entertaining!,8,29 March 2020,"Probably the biggest surprise of 2019! Based on the Dark Horse graphic novels by Mike Mignola, we go back to an earlier stage of Hellboy's development in the Bureau of Paranormal Investigation and Defence in which he needs to save the world from the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) and her minions. I went into this one extremely nervous as I absolutely love the original two films directed by Guillermo Del Toro and Ron Perlman's depiction is so iconic how could this one be any good? In the first half an hour I struggled. The giggles were more miss than hit and it's more adulterated tone than previous incarnations on screen was a little jarring. Gradually I relaxed into it and let it entertain me; it's pretty hard to resist after a while! The dark humour runs thick throughout and the creepiness of the creature design really won me over (well done to the make-up, visual and practical effects department for creating some unforgettable imagery!) The cast put their all into it; David Harbour does a pretty good job with a role that is really hard to follow up. Ian McShane is fun as Professor Broom, Jovovich is fantastic as the main villain and Sasha Lane really stands out in her role as Alice, a spiritual medium who comes along for the ride. It also features Stephen Graham as a psychotic man-pig; what's not to like there?! Director Neil Marshall (The Descent, Dog Soliders) injects pitch black nasty horror which does mesh really well with the original source material. It reaches amazing heights in sequences such as the giant fight which is riotously action packed and deliciously bloody; a bit like The Hobbit on speed. A scene in which Hellboy encounters Baba Yaga, an ancient witch with pegs for legs and an appetite for children's flesh, is genuinely creepy with a sinister nightmarish quality in which you don't know whether to laugh or be really worried. Probably my favourite scene the more I think about it! Although it may miss the charm and darkly magical quality of the originals, it still packs a red-fisted punch when it wants to and has sequences that are incredible!",Hellboy
109,shawneofthedead,"Enough good ideas and visual flair to be worth a watch, but it's also sorely missing the crucial ingredients that made del Toro's films take flight: heart and soul.",5,24 April 2019,"THE LOW-DOWN: Hellboy, a cult comic creation dreamt up by Mike Mignola, is a fascinating meditation on the eternal 'nature vs. nurture' debate: can a demon child rebel against the blood that flows through his veins and choose his own fate? The movie-going public was first introduced to the existential crisis that is Hellboy in 2004 by visionary director Guillermo del Toro, whose gothic sensibilities and love of the ugly misfit were a perfect fit for the source material. 15 years and a couple of jettisoned productions later, the third Hellboy film - a del-Toro-free reboot, rather than a sequel - is finally thundering into cinemas, and will have you wondering if it was worth all that time and effort.THE STORY: Hellboy (David Harbour) - under the guidance of his adoptive father, Trevor (Ian McShane) - is hunting down monsters for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) when destiny comes a-calling. Nimue (Milla Jovovich), a dastardly sorceress of world-destroying power, is set to break free from her several prisons so that she can turn the world of men into a haven for monsters. Accompanied by living ouija board Alice Monaghan (Sasha Lane) and grumpy BPRD agent Ben Daimio (Daniel Dae Kim), Hellboy must decide if he will help or hinder Nimue as she sets the apocalypse in motion.THE GOOD: This new incarnation of Hellboy is fierce and unapologetic in everything it does - from its shiveringly awful monsters to its explosive moments of mayhem and carnage. If that's your kind of thing, you'll enjoy what director Neil Marshall, best known for cult horror flicks like The Descent and Dog Soldiers, is going for here. He leans heavily into the 'creature' aspect of 'creature feature', particularly in nightmarish scenes featuring Nimue regaining her body (think Frankenstein, with an added cringe factor) and unholy mess of a witch Baba Yaga collapsing and contorting her way across the screen.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: Unfortunately, the film is a mess in pretty much every other way, teetering between brilliant, bonkers and bad - often in the same moment. Part of that is due to the strangely uneven special effects and prosthetics, which range from eye-popping to laughable. But it's in Andrew Cosby's desperately plot-obsessed screenplay too, which contains some great, fun ideas but constantly undercuts itself with painfully banal dialogue and minimal character development. It's a very peculiar experience to be simultaneously fascinated by and disappointed in a scene or character, and that keeps happening throughout Marshall's film.SAFE HARBOUR? You'd never know it beneath the unwieldy prosthetics, but Hellboy is played - this time around - by one of the breakout stars of Netflix's Stranger Things. It's a shame that you can barely see what Harbour is bringing to the character and the performance; his hangdog charm and ability to emote is buried under layers of red make-up and a stubbornly fake chin. He looks great in still photographs, but often appears clunky and clumsy in motion. Script-wise, Harbour isn't given much to do, beyond playing catch with the next plot point and battle sequence. As a result, his Hellboy winds up as the least interesting character in a film actually named after him.RUNNING THE GOOD RACE: If nothing else, Hellboy has a lesson to teach Hollywood and casting agents the world over about whitewashing and the importance of representation. Ed Skrein was originally cast as Ben Daimio, but voluntarily withdrew from the project when he realised that the character was of Japanese origin. It's still annoying that Asians from different countries are interchangeable in Hollywood terms - Kim is of Korean descent - but, hey, baby steps are better than nothing. At least Kim acquits himself quite well in a complex role, although his British accent is wobbly at best.RECOMMENDED? It's a toss-up. There are enough good ideas and visual flair for Hellboy to be worth a watch, but it's also sorely missing the crucial ingredients that made del Toro's films take flight: heart and soul.",Hellboy
110,DeBBss,The Screenplay Ruined Everything,3,17 May 2020,"Hellboy has a lot of issues that are common within action movies; it has a terribly written story with underdeveloped characters. It's so disappointing because Hellboy had such deep lore and there's so much you can do with it, but they didn't build on it. Hellboy isn't completely bad, it does a lot of right things that stay true to the original source material. If they just worked harder on the screenplay, then Hellboy would've been great like the Guillermo del Toro Hellboys.The plot itself isn't bad, although it's completely unoriginal; the issue is everything surrounding the plot. The screenplay is just lazy, like it's been written by a child. There were moments when the characters went from one location to another location without any scenes between the jump. The writers could have added some scenes that develops the story and characters more between that jump, because the whole story felt blurry and rushed. There should have been at least fifteen minutes at the beginning to setup everything, like creating character traits, but instead they got straight to the point. The pacing was just weird, at times where the movie is really ramping up, it stops immediately, then starts again. It really killed the second act and it effected the third act negatively. There was so much exposition dumping that was poorly added in, and somehow with all the exposition, everything still feels one dimensional. Everything felt forced too, like everything had to happen because it's a movie.The characters are terribly written too. None of the characters had a solid foundation to build upon, not even Hellboy had a good foundation. There was little to no exposition given to any of the characters, so they were all just boring and had no personality. Hellboy is such a one dimensional character in this movie, and that really surprised me because there's so much you can do with him. Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy had personality; he hated things and he loved things like real people, but this Hellboy didn't show any interest in anything. The relationship between Hellboy and his father was just weak. They barely had any time together and there were no scenes of them showing that they have a good relationship at all, unlike del Toro's Hellboy. This poorly developed relationship is the reason why the death of Hellboy's father isn't even sad.Hellboy did do some things right. There was fantastic imagery throughout the film that really shows the creativity of the film makers. The lore was so deep and that's where they stayed true to the original source material. It's unfortunate because if the script did a harder job on exploring the lore, then Hellboy would've been a great fantasy movie. The action was very entertaining and violent, which made Hellboy even more true to the original comics. The last thing I want to touch on is the weird CGI. At times the CGI looks very passable, but at other times it looks horrible. It was all fine until the last fight scene where the CGI completely took me out of the movie.Overall, Hellboy was a wasted opportunity; it had a vision, but was ultimately ruined by the screenplay. If the screenplay was good, then the characters, the pacing, and the story would've been great. Hellboy is a movie that you should watch only if you get the opportunity to watch it for free, because this movie isn't worth renting price.",Hellboy
111,DuskShadow,One Helluva Ride!,7,20 April 2019,"I gotta say I was impressed with this.
I was very much into the occult and supernatural,myth and legend before the first two movies by Del toro came out years back, and even without reading the comics, I became a fan of the franchise.
Though what the first two films lacked in realism, and due to the penchant that Del Toro has for using make up and costumes with that look to them that only accompany a film he directs/ works on, the ron pearlman films looked a bit too cartooney.
This latest rendition of the Hellboy property lost most of that.
It was a fun romp through british myth, with a unique take on the arthurian legend, and borrowed heavily from the comic more than the previous flicks did.
What I could not decide upon, was which version of Hellboy I preferred.
Regardless, I was so glad to see another comic book adaptation get an R rating, and avoid most of the tired tedium other films go through. This movie had plenty of gore and violence to sate anyone thats into action, especially a comic nerd. The visuals were usually very good, I would say almost all the time, though some of the characters were kinda cheesy. And mila jovavich as the main villainess...that wasa bit lame. Still, the addition of some elements from classic occultism and certain famed characters was a delight, and the movie being just over 2 hours was well worth the money I spent to see it.
Plus Ian McShane, the coolest dude around. there may have been some spots where the dude playing hellboy could have worked on more at the gym, but at least McShane compensated for that. Heres to the start of a new take on the series. DRINKS! Next up, nazi hunting and Rasputin! lol 8/10",Hellboy
112,W011y4m5,Dire.,1,12 December 2020,"The worst films I've ever seen are usually movies I consider ""the worst"" due to their offensive representations or vulgar intended statements... But the ""Hellboy"" reboot is honestly one of those very rare features which gains the title as ""one of the worst"" due its sheer irredeemable incompetence.
In fact, it is so rare to watch a new release which fails at every basic level but somehow, this one manages it; from the directing to the performances to the editing to the music to the writing & the dialogue... It contains a damning series of cataclysmic, systematic failures (I actually doubt were made willingly by the creatives in their fields of expertise) which culminate to form one of the most pitiful crap fests I've ever forcefully subjected myself to - & to think we got this over Guillermo Del Toro's final installment in the trilogy? Unforgivable.P.S.Unsurprisingly, I've recently learned that Neil Marshall's original vision for the blockbuster was apparently compromised by studio involvement (when will they ever learn?) so I won't blame him for being forced to make appalling directorial choices, considering they weren't really his to make. It also explains the uncharacteristically poor quality of the general filmmaking; it was crafted by executives interfering, not actual filmmakers - whose filmographies were unfairly tarnished by this project.",Hellboy

director: Neil Marshal
starring: David Harbour,Milla Jovovich,Ian Mcshane,Sasha Lane,Daniel Day Kim etcoverall rating 37/100
Hellboy had some potential, but the director and everyone behind this film could not achieve what i believe they wanted to ending in a messy,over the top bad remake that makes you question the film industries reasoning for doing certain remakes.Lets start of with a positive ( despite there being a limited amount) David harbour did a great job as the lead character. I am not sure whether he was auite as strong as Ron Perlman, but he still managed to capture the charm,witty and troubled character of hellboy like the comic books portrayed him as. And despite his character arc being almost the same as the original i still enjoyed his character develop throughout the film.Now however i must mention as a negative that there was some lazy character designs for some of the monsters. It was all very self explanatory there was a bat and a pig and some giants it lacked imagination and creativity for me. The Demons at the end were a big improvement but still left me feeling underwhelmed at the films lack of creative imagination.Next i would say that i enjoyed some, not all but some of the action sequences within Hellboy. The key scenes that i enjoyed were the giant scene and the church scene. These were so surreal to watch you could not help but enjoy yourself just for a few minutes. The gore was very gruesome but that should not bother most people.However i would like to say that despite me not being bothered by the gore, i do think that this film was over reliant and overused the violence and bloody gore. It just felt unnecessary in places and just thrown in the film for the sake of it. Some of it was just not needed, the originals were great and were still violent but had more creative flair and didn't rely on one particular thing. This film just felt very safe and they did not want to go out of there comfort zones.Next i think Mila Jovovich did a good job as the villain nimway. Her passion to destroy everything in her path and having no emotion when killing many people really made you dislike her as a villain. So the film did a good job with this and her getting put together was fun to watch. Also the lead female character Alice ( Sasha Lane) she had a natural charm to her acting that made you instantly like her as soon as you first saw her. Also her character arc and powers were incredibly interesting and entertaining to watch.Next i would like to say that i did not like Daniel day kims character. Honestly he bored me and i did not connect to his character or his powers at all and his relationship with the characters felt very forced and unnatural. He also did not get enough of a back story for people to connect to him as a character.Also the humour fell very flat making the film very awkward in places. Sometimes trying to hard to be funny has the opposite effect and this was the case here . I hardly laughed at all at the moments that were supposed to be humorous which often made it uncomfortable and awkward to watch as you just wanted the next scene to happen.Next i would like to add that the CGI in this film was actually pretty bad. You could tell this film was a low budget blockbuster, it was a perfect case of them trying to go all out with the special effects but not actually being able to leading to a mess. So many creatures and demons looked incredibly unrealistic especially the pig which actually made me laugh at how bad he looked.Also i would like to say that i found Daniel Day kims character very boring. Nothing about his character made you connect with him at all, he did not get a good enough character arc or backstory so his character just felt very disconnected from everyone else and not fun or entertaining at all.Next i also had big issues with the pacing in Hellboy. It all felt very rushed to me, they never allowed you to let any scene sink in, which i think was a big issue as it did not allow you to connect with film as much i should of done. Any emotional scene or any detailed parts of the plot was rushed and you did not have enough time to feel any emotion or feeling.Next i did like a lot of the horror elements that they added. A lot of the more tense and jumpier scenes involving zombies or monsters actually were fairly entertaining to watch as it kept you on the edge of the seat. And it also gave me in my opinion the best scene in the whole film, Baba Yaga, This scene was fantastic, as it stuck to what baba yaga was supposed to be, her creepy movements and voice was uncomfortable but great to watch.Now finally ending on the last few negatives, firstly the ending was so over the top it actually made me laugh in places when it shouldn't of done. With the introduction of the demons from hell and Merlin and Arthur it just felt to much and the director was trying to hard to add to many components to the film.Also i found that there was lapses in the logic and reality of the film. Yes Hellboy is supposed to heal quicker then humans therefore making him more likely to survive accidents, but in one particular scene he got stabbed so many times and most of the spears went straight through his body that even that would of killed him, so i just thought that this was a very odd choice for the director to make.And finally the plot just felt overstuffed with unneeded content. They made it completely the opposite to the originals and could not focus on one particular thing for the film, it just felt like 3 or 4 different films mushed together into 1.Overall Hellboy had some good and interesting qualities to it, but even they did not live up there full potential, leading to a messy lazily done film that did not need to be remade.",Hellboy

116,gavinp9,Average attempt at a darker hero,6,13 April 2019,"'Hellboy' is a total reboot of the (great) 2004/2008 films by Guillermo del Toro - this time Hellboy is played by Harbour and still looks pretty great with this makeup & giant right fist. This time around is from the director of 'Doomsday' and 'The Descent', so it has much more of a horror/gore/supernatural leaning than the other films. To ensure the R-rating, on top of the all the blood and violence, there's also plenty of (often needless) swearing.Plot is somehow linked to King Arthur, Merlin and the Blood Queen (Jovovich), an ancient witch who's resurrected to wreck havoc. Hellboy has to team up with Daimio (Dae Kim) from M11 and Alice (Lane), an old friend and clairvoyant, to stop ""Nimue"". There's giants, vampires, ghouls and all sorts of weird stuff, but the hardest to go along with is Gruagach (Graham), who is basically just Bebop from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. McShane as Prof Bloom is good, but under-used, and Lane is solid, but the rest of the cast don't really bring too much and go through the motions.There's some great CGI, but also some creatures and shots that are a bit too gratuitous and don't really add to the story, particularly in the final scenes. Harbour is OK as Hellboy, but is missing some of Pearlman's charm. In general, the film lacks the heart and humour of the original films - and sorely misses Liz & Abe Sapien.",Hellboy

119,rollernerd,Kickstart my heart,6,3 June 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the reboot of the film series I have recently had heaps of fun, in the flick Hellboy (2019), with a new cast and a new leading man in red. I really hoped for a third and final entry in the series where Perlman will portray Hellboy meeting his destiny as foretold by the Death. Especially with Hellboy was to have twins and for us to finally to see his true form on how is to bring Armageddon. Instead we have a new storyline. Okay to be honest, I didn't mind the film. It isn't anything comparable to Guillermo del Toro's vision but I really didn't mind it.The great Ron Perlman casts a long shadow of the title character and the new leading man, Stranger Things alum, David Harbour, does well but really pales in comparison as the new man in red. What this film lacks in is creativity like the first two flick. Yes it is heavy with special effects, so much CGI which makes you miss the set pieces from the original two flicks. But you still have creatures from the dark lore such as Baba Yaga, Lucha Libre Vampires, Giants, Demons and a foul talking fairy known as Gruagach. That's another difference with this film is the constant swearing which really misses out on the magic and charm that was felt in the first two. Another key addition to this film is the blood and gore which takes me back to the CGI... the CGI is overused and although the blood, gore and even the design of the creatures are all very interesting, it takes away the actual story and doesn't provide the character depth in comparison to del Toro's flicks. The story and character were a great idea but lacked execution as it only touched the surface. Plus why give us past event explanations towards the end of the flick which instead it should been setup from key situations and dialog from key characters?? And why give us the Lobster character when we hardly see him?? I would have been soooo happy to see more of Thomas Haden Church as this unique character!Back to Harbour's performance, the guy did alright, his version of the character is more whiny, young and emotive while trying to be a wise trash talking hero. Again, Perlman will always be the big red guy to me. Having said that Harbour realty carries the film which doesn't do well for him considering the direction of the flick misses great opportunities to capitalise this new iteration of Hellboy. This new film story follows Nimue played by Resident Evil alum Milla Jovovich, a blood witch that was destroyed long time ago by no other than King Arthur. Jovovich hardly has a real evil presence and her character feels recycled. Even her climatic fight with Hellboy was brief and disappointing!! She got betrayed at the start of the film and after a millennium of being locked away she hardly make a stand off fight with the protagonist? Comonnnnnn!! There were some cool new surprises of characters such as Alice who really learns her abilities throughout the movie. And we have Daimio a military guy who can transform into a jaguar beast, which again is heavily dependent on CGI. The CGI is extremely bad in a few scenes where one of Alice's talents include communicating with the dead by creating a psychic link where a ghoulish looking version of the deceased extends from her throat out of her mouth - now this is creative but it appears that no money whatsoever went into making the effect come across as interesting. As mentioned, the flick does deliver a lot of bloody action sequences, but rather than creativity and unique, this film has similarities to a gory video game. For instance the action shots of Hellboy battling three giants is so similar to a video game as the scenes are surrounded by a number of swirling camera movements. Props to the filmmakers providing a great rock soundtrack during a few of the action sequences. Heaps of limbs getting torn off from people, heaps of guts and gore but the movie lacks real creativity, it was great having a reference to Excalibur and Merlin but the tone of the film felt cartoonish and a PS4 game rather than the uniqueness I was used to, overall 6/10.",Hellboy

We saw what they did over there to ""make it more real"" - I hated it, and I still do. I don't like the solution of Neil Marshall and his script writer, Andrew Cosby, any better.What they did, is not a new idea, it's used often in sci-fi and fantasy film. Since the story is fantastic, one makes sure the special effects are as vivid and gory as possible. This works fine when it's being used in moderation, but when one has a movie building for the arriving apocalypse, where does one draw the line. How much blood has to flaw from the screen, for the spectators to feel that the apocalypse is real? Does anyone coming to see Hellboy, even wants it to feel real?And it started so nicely, even before the start when I realized they didn't use 3D for this film, I was sure they didn't go for the ""real feeling"" having a story so fantastic one can't expect to feel real to begin with. In fact, most of the movie went by and I was OK with what I was seeing. Acting was good, they did make Hellboy a bit too whiny, but I could take it. And then the final 15 minutes or so arrived. I'm not doing spoilers, that's my rule so I'll only say that these final minutes went well above my personal lines. And as I said, well above the needs of the movie. Even the dark sense of humor, which carried the movie so well up to the crescendo bit, dies away, when it's needed the most.One last point, in favour of the movie - I like what the movie was saying: ""a monster is not a question of appearance, a monster is a question of deeds"".

In two hours of the film it's left the impression that everyone there are all the time running to somewhere, hurry and late somewhere(it's not about importance of time, I am telling about general film behavior). It's trying to show that happening something important on the screen, but does not explain at all why the viewer should feel that it is important. And, of course, flat jokes of a ""cheap stand-up comic from some cheap night bar"". Jokes that are not even always out of place, said simply because the viewer not laughed for a five last minutes...
It would be better to try to make the continuation of the old film, there would be fewer complaints.

This reboot is directed by Neil Marshall, the director of Dog Soldiers, Doomsday and The Descent.In the film, Hellboy (David Harbor) is meant to protect the world from creatures that are beyond imaginative nature and who have foreseen humanity. Professor Broom (Ian McShane), the man who found and raised Hellboy, teaches that dark creatures plan to bring Nimue the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) back to life. Hellboy has to work with another, who also have their special powers, to stop the dark ones before they bring Nimue back. Nimue will eradicate humanity and take over the earth with her dark army.With this reboot they have unfortunately made a messy new Hellboy movie. This is because too many different people had something to say about the new Hellboy film and added some extras to the story themselves, but this seems to have been done without any consultation with the rest of the people who worked on the film or had something to say about it. For example, some scenes are very dark while others are comically filled in an attempt to make the film a bit lighter.Too many different things happen at a rapid pace, making the film often difficult to follow. This also makes the film more filthy. Due to the pace of the film, the many characters are also introduced too quickly and presented to you about their mutual relationships with each other. This way, these relationships seem unbelievable and it doesn't really seem like the characters really care about each other. For example, if someone gets hurt or dies, it doesn't seem to really affect Hellboy or other characters.
The film was also made for 16 years and older. For example, the film has extra bloody action scenes and scenes that scold a lot, but unfortunately this does not make the film really better or more entertaining.The effects also look simple or bad. You can often see where they have used CGI or a green screen. In this way, the film does not really come across as credible and it feels as if you are watching a film from the beginning of the nineties, which is directed by a starting director.The acting also comes across as somewhat rigid to most and it often seems as if they are simply reading their texts without adding any emotions or feelings to make it more special or to give it a little more life. David Harbor and Milla Jovovich seem to be trying a little bit to add some extras to their roles, but unfortunately without success or that it can really be seen.With the old Hellboy films by Guillermo del Toro they worked better on the stories and effects. Guillermo del Toro also made use of both CGI and real costumes and masks in his Hellboy films, making the creatures in his films more credible. As a Hellboy fan or if you want to see a Hellboy film, you can simply stick to the old films. It is a shame that a third Hellboy film never came into this series. Many of the old cast were willing to come back for a third film, but unfortunately could never agree on a real plan for a third film.",Hellboy

Nobody is convincing and the final result of the film from the dramatic point of view hardly interests anyone. It does not matter whether good or bad win.

130,darkreignn,The Film Nudist reviews: Hellboy,5,28 April 2019,"Watching ""Hellboy"" and learning about all of the issues and disagreements during production made me come to a realization: sometimes, in life, things just don't go your way. Take me for example. I went to college for Communications, specifically focusing on religion and film. I was a straight A student; my teachers literally thought my critical analysis of religious philosophy was so good that it could get me into graduate school. And now a year after graduation, what am I doing? Writing social media posts that get ripped apart during the editing phase for a healthcare company that recently laid off hundreds upon hundreds of employees, which left me drinking away my worries about my ever-increasingly unstable job security. What am I trying to say? Basically, my life is a lot like ""Hellboy,"" as in scatterbrained, mediocre, boring, and dragging on for too long.That being said, ""Hellboy"" isn't all bad. In fact, I was looking forward to watching it, even with the middling reviews. I wasn't expecting it to be good, I just wanted some cool action and a quickly paced, entertaining superhero film. Looks like I'll have to wait for ""Endgame"" to get those things, because they weren't in ""Hellboy!""The film did have a few entertaining aspects. The acting was fine, Mila Jovovich was sexy, there was a badass dream sequence type thing where you also see some boobies, and there was one really awesome action sequence that looked like it belonged in ""God of War."" Other than that though, the movie was, unfortunately, pretty bland and boring; you could tell how much of it was cut and edited around, leaving no one's vision clearly visible. There was also a surprising lack of action, which was disappointing in a two hour long superhero film.That being said, the set design and cinematography were very beautiful. Gothic, eerie, and reminiscent of ""Silent Hill"" at times, the locations the film takes you to are so visually stunning that you can almost forgive how mediocre the rest of the movie is. Almost.""Hellboy"" wasn't a bad time at the movies. It had just enough gory action and cool sets to be interesting and visually pleasing to watch, but not enough plot coherency and action to be an entertaining and fulfilling two hours. I'm not disappointed that I saw this movie, but I can say with confidence that I'll never watch it again.5/10",Hellboy

They recreated the hellboy, restarted the story but what one bad way of making it. Milla Jovovich was only thing good but i seriously wish to see her in a good movie once again.

132,martinrobertson300482,Awful,2,3 May 2019,"""Hellboy"" (2019) has to be one of the most misguided movies ever. Anyone who was interested wanted a third movie in the original series, so this new take is a serious gamble that hasn't paid off.If they'd gone the darker, more adult route with this it could of still been decent. But after the ""jokey"" trailers I think everyone knew this was a bomb. Still, curiosity got the better of me and I just had to know how bad this really was.The sad part is that they had the right idea with the effects. Sticking with a good mix of computer and practical stuff. But this makes it all the more disapointing when the movie is still an overblown mess, annoyingly bouncing from one random thing to another, and doing it with irritatingly jumpy camera work.The script is terrible, most of the jokes are cringeworthy, and the budget spent on the good effects has clearly run out by the lousy ending. There will be no more of these I'm guessing. So don't waste your cash.",Hellboy

134,swedzin,Who is the target audience here?,2,8 July 2019,"What a hell? No, seriously... what a hell? For who was this film made? The pacing is too fast, things happen too fast and without any sense. It doesn't have a proper build up and things are just thrown in our face randomly. This film is like a whimsical, noisy little brat which is out of control! There are, literally scenes so loud, without any apparent reason that drives you insane. And not to mention, combine that with humor which is scattered all over this poor film. Yes - humor! Out of nowhere, nearly in 90% of the film. Without any mercy, this film acts just like ""The Last Jedi"", or even ""Predator""(2018).... Who were the writers and producers? No, really, who are they? Are they real filmmakers, or just bunch of hacks who wants to force biggest piles of loud crap to audience's faces? The action scenes are also all over the place. The film cannot take a decent rest for character to develop or make them likeable. No. Character talk and then - fight. The dialogue is bad and it seems like it was written by a 12 year olds. I bet that Mike Mignola had a stroke after he saw the final product. According to the IMDb, Mignola was far more directly involved with this film, in order to make it darker and true to the comic. How so? The only thing that is dark about this film is violence and gore. The gore is way over the top and not subtle at all. Sure, Hellboy comics has gore, but it is subtle! Here? Not even close. Jesus Christ... Now, I haven't read most of the Hellboy comic books, but I read some of the most crucial and well known short stories and collections. And, guess what? This film is total opposite of those. The comic book has a really good, dark and serious tone... but it seems that these writers, producers and director decided not to risk and make anything edgy, so they decided to make this loud mess.So, let's check the actors and characters. This film contains some terrible characters and you cannot relate to them. These characters were only stapled on the big screen, but they have no presence, no charisma, no traits or development. So, David Harbour is our new Hellboy. I've seen some of his films, but did not notice his full potential back then. He is most famous for ""Stranger Things"", however I haven't saw that yet. I can see that he is trying hard to do something with the character of Hellboy, but it's not working. And it's not his fault, because the director and writers definitively did not give him anything proper to work with! But, in scenes where he's screaming... that was annoying. Also, the character is portrayed as a complete and utter jerk. Sure, Hellboy can be brash and jest on certain occasions. But, he is down to earth, serious and dark character. This Hellboy doesn't seem to take things seriously... Just like the makers of this film. Ian McShane plays professor Broom. This has to be the worst portrayal of Prof. Broom. McShane is an amazing actor, but they made this guy into a vulgar, non-likeable jerk! Have they even seen prof. Broom? Totally sweet, wise and caring character. This one was a total miss! And I feel sorry for McShane here, for appearing in this piece of turd. Sure, he did it for the paycheck and that's OK. But to make character like this? Not OK. Yep, as I said - he is vulgar. Now, don't get me wrong, I like swearing like every other person here. But, did you really had to make professor Broom to sound like Al Swearengen. Swearengen is another character played by McShane in brilliant TV series ""Deadwood""and the character is known for constant swearing. Broom is not Swearengen! Just like I said before, the film was written by a 12 year olds who just discovered swearing. For f^^k's sake... To have swearing from other characters... it just doesn't fit. I am not saying it's inappropriate, I am saying that there was no reason for it. Now, we have Milla Jovovich. Her performance was somewhat fair, and she has a decent villainous presence, but the character was written poorly and she will fade away very quick from your memory. Not memorable at all. And she did not turn into dragon just like in comics... why not? Now, Alice Monaghan... She is an Irish girl who can talk to ghosts... and played by Sasha Lane? Lane is a British actress of mixed races. I don't see why would you cast a mixed race actress to play an already established character that is white and red headed... It would seem that Millenium pictures was threatened by Disney... why do I have such a feeling? Since Disney loves to spew all those crap about diversity and forcing it down to people's throat like a religion. Anyway, her character was not that interesting, she was pretty much over-powered in the film and of course, just like Rey in ""Star Wars"", she did not know that she had it in her. But, I think, over time she'll be good in her craft. Also, we have Mj. Ben Daimio... played by Daniel Kim. Nothing really special. We also have a character called Gruagach... a large, humanoid pig-head creature that is also without any reason crass... But the actor who voices it. He was OK. Also, the Lobster guy? Sure, he was comics, but he has no purpose here. Other characters? Nothing new and nothing special...The CGI was OK in some scenes, but in most of them - terrible. Music score was also awful. It is extremely rare from me to say that there is a bad musical score in films. But, this film has it. And that is another thing that grieves me terribly. The score was noisy and out of place. Why? Why not making a decent score that fits into film? Well, I guess that this one actually fits because, if you are making crap... add more crap and make it even crappier. I could not wait for it to be over, honestly, because it just keeps going and going. Stretched all the way into agonizing eternity. Even during and after the ending credits... it just won't let you go. Why?!So, I don't recommend this film, at the end... throw it into fiery lake of hell and let it stay there and melt for eternity, because this is just another proof of how Hollywood lost it's integrity. No more ideas, no more risks, no more original stuff... just the same bland, clichéd things from today's pathetic, uncreative Hollywood... Audiences don't deserve this. Either Hollywood must regain it's good old reputation, or audiences will rebel with their wallets. And I support that! You want our money, Hollywood? EARN IT!!",Hellboy
135,TheVictoriousV,A middle stone-finger to Guillermo,3,17 April 2019,"At first, the 2019 Hellboy reboot looked woesomely generic, but I enjoyed the visual direction and monster designs of later trailers. However, the look of said ads also made me wonder why Lionsgate just couldn't give in and let Guillermo Del Toro direct his Hellboy 3 as he'd always wanted. What we have here is essentially a Del Toro film without the magic that truly makes it work.The Del Toro flare is not the only thing missing in this particular Hellboy, though. The digital effects are astoundingly bad - not always made up for by the interesting action sequences or morbidly clever gore shots - and the characters only briefly show hints of likability, without ever really going there. It also throws in Marvel-brand quips here and there because, really, what film doesn't?David Harbour of Stranger Things fame plays Hellboy, or ""Red"", not looking too different from the Hellboy we already have, only he seems to have had a few too many packets of Winston and just generally forgot how to look after himself. He's a giant bore with intervals of inept comic relief and his sidekicks (Sasha Lane and Daniel Dae Kim) aren't much to write Satan about either.The head of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense this time around is Ian McShane, also Hellboy's adoptive pep-pep, and the main threat is an evil queen (Milla Jovovich), brought back by a vengeful pig-man. Her scenes are some of the more visually memorable of the film. I like how her red dress sticks out from the charred landscape in one scene. Also of semi-importance are Thomas Haden Church in a cameo that may please Dark Horse comics fans, and Brian Gleeson as Merlin. Yes, THE Merlin. Even Russian folklore celebrity Baba Yaga gets a role.The inclusion of magical and occult elements, be they from the comics or real-world superstition, of course makes sense. What we lack is an audience surrogate like FBI Agent Myers in the first ever Hellboy film - a normal guy reacting to the otherwordly sights. Still, it can be exciting to simply enter a supernatural world and observe its inhabitants, all of them used to what they themselves see and hear every day. Alas, that works better when the characters are more interesting than what we're given here.One significant plus, in my mind, is the R-rating, which is a better fit for the world of Hellboy than the PG-13 one. It elevates the film ever so slightly, as we're now allowed to see some amusingly executed gore. Del Toro's movies felt a little lame in that regard. Fights between hellbeasts, monsters, and other ancient forces should produce more blood than what little we got in The Golden Army, for instance.So this is by some measure a fun movie, yes, but it is also miserable. This is the final result of no-one listening to Del Toro and instead trying to cash in on his style, now with a dash of MCU; just not the dash that gives us enjoyable characters or well-rendered visuals. Was it worth it? Here's a hint: nope.Fun fact: Hellboy belongs to Dark Horse Comics, whose only other famous comic character is Big Head, whom you may know better as the being played by Jim Carrey in 1994's The Mask. Considering the state of modern movies and how everything everywhere has to be the same, I don't doubt we'll see a reboot of The Mask where Harbour reprises Hellboy in a post-credit scene. The Cinematic Horse Universe - get to it! You know you wanna.",Hellboy
136,Nemesis42,Mixed up.,5,11 January 2020,"Quite a different take on the franchise compared to the last two movies.
They were clever comedies mostly. This does not know what it is. It's a gore fest for the most part. A lack of character development and cast ensemble synergy fails it. The heavy and seriously toned horror and gore conflicts with the attempts at humor, trying to draw upon the hell-boy characters humor from the past.The only joke that worked for me was ""I need a mint"".",Hellboy

Also, I am a fan of Ian McShane and he is his usual wry self here.",Hellboy
139,kevinxirau,Did hell just get a little colder?,4,15 September 2019,"My first intro to the Dark Horse character Hellboy was with the 2004 film by Guillermo del Toro. While not the first hell-spawned hero, he stood out from the rest, largely due to Ron Perlman's performance and the world he inhabits. It spawned a sequel as well as two animated features, all solid watches. It's a shame a third for each series was never made because this time we were given the first reboot directed by Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers). Needless to say, it left me and plenty of others begging for the OG Hellboy's continuation.Plot: Hellboy (David Harbour), a demon turned paranormal agent, begins to question his place in the world and his relationship with his adopted father Professor Broom. This internal conflict escalates when he is tasked with tracking down the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich), who takes a special interest in him for her diabolical ambitions. Together, Hellboy and his band of supernatural misfits must battle their way through all sorts of things that go bump in the night in order to stop the evil witch.The film adds more stuff from the comics as well as blood + gore to stand out from previous films, a valiant attempt that feels wasted. When I saw the trailer to this reboot, I could tell that it was damned from the start. In fairness, the action is pretty good, the creature designs and visuals are cool, there are a few clever lines/jokes, and there are decent performances (Harbour is OK, just not Perlman). I daresay the story had a potential, challenging Hellboy's beliefs of whether or not he's just a weapon and if monsters really deserve to die. However, it's one thing to have the ingredients, knowing how to properly mix them is another. There are many pointless elements like the fight with the giants and Hellboy's stone right hand. The attempt at moral ambiguity and existentialism isn't resolved in a satiating way and exposition gets repetitive. Much of the humor is flatter than paper and the constant swearing gets old fast as if a thirteen year old wrote this. The quality of the CGI ranges from adequate to downright awful (like late 90s bad), opposed by practical effects that are more consistent. Did I forget to mention that this film loves flashbacks because, holy crap, there's a lot of them, and their scattered use messes up the pacing. Don't even get me started on the blatant sequel-baiting finale and end credit scenes.If there's such a thing as purgatory, then it looks more like a pleasant day off compared to this. Not the worst superhero ever made (*cough* Catwoman), but Hellboy 2019 is a mediocre film at best. Back to the drawing board.",Hellboy

142,Dragonsouls,This character deserves more love,7,16 April 2019,"Just like Hellboy deserves personally and socially, the movie Hellboy felt like a movie that wasn't loved enough by producers/filmmakers.

He was fiery, passionate, funny, cool, creepy, and a bit relatable. He was a bit conflicted, and you felt his alienation from society, which bothered him, but the story wasn't centered around him too much, but rather, a simple but interesting plot.Those who do not understand that the hero and villain signify might not enjoy this film. It's a film for Hellboy fans and fans of the paranormal in general. Theologians, mythology heads, occultists, you get the drift. If you are not into that stuff then there is no way you would enjoy this film, which is a bit esoteric for casuals.It wasn't the most complicated plot, or a film that will make you cry, it was a funny, artistic campy action popcorn film and that is about it. I laughed, cheered, and loved Harbour in every scene. He is the coolest thing I've seen in a long time but it could have been a much more powerful film.As a Hellboy fan, I wanted more but still felt somewhat satisfied in the end because the movie had some really memorable moments.

get a movie that feels like all gore no substance to it. Having gore is not necessarily a bad thing. It's the one thing this Hellboy reboot has going for it, but if you care about the plot, the characters, or the effort put into the production side
of things, then it's one heck of a wreck of a movie.Hellboy himself in this version is a completely unlikable guy with pretty much no redeeming qualities to him at all. He makes bad jokes after bad jokes with not a single good quip or one-liner. He's just a total jerk with no heart and no where near as memorable as Ron Pearlman's portrayal. The other characters don't fare that much better. The pig creature is probably the overall best, but the villain
is very one-dimensional as well as the other supporting characters. Everything just feels watered down. The special effects are really bad and the annoying music sprinkled throughout the movie doesn't help either.Overall, the Hellboy reboot was just lame. Like sure it was more gory and if you like to see a bloody version then you'll get that, but for me it lacked the things I liked in the previous Hellboy movies, such as the production side of things and the depth of the story and the characters. It felt like a cash grab and the company trying to bank on the name without realising what made Hellboy decent in the first place.

However what I feel let the film ultimately down was that the story and plot were as expected, a tried and tested tale you've seen over and OVER again.
Normally we can get past this with some great action, however, the action in this movie felt lazy and it seems they decided to to mash a few flashy images together that basically translated to-
""ok punch that thing, now punch him back, ok ok that's good, now throw a punch, yes good, but maybe this time let's try throwing a punch, wow what a good punch, can we get another punch in there? EXCELENT, now let's try a kic.... actually, throw a punch""And that's what happens a few times until the scene ends.There was a good attempt at world building but MY HOLY MOLY UNDERPANTS (not a MJ joke I swear) there was SO MUCH to try and follow, far too many characters and when they're mentioned later in the story I found myself going ""ok, I don't know who the 'hellboy' that is.Maybe if this movie was spread over two films then we could have gotten something great.Alas it's no thriller, it'd ain't bad, so I'll beat it.",Hellboy

And there aren't any side characters to add color the way they did in Del Toro's movies.
Having said that, I thought the story was told reasonably well. I didn't get why they had to double cross him when there were ACTUAL giants that needed killing. Why not wait until after he killed those giants? Some strange plot choices like that are what hurts this movie.

The story was fast paced, David Harbour was appealing and funny, the gore was awesome, and the ending was satisfying. Of course it was a really stupid movie, but it was still fun. I was expecting something so atrocious that it would make me kick my seat in anger but I didn't. I saw past most of the flaws because I was entertained by the dark, funny, testosterone filled giddiness that was Hellboy. It's not Del Toro and Perlman and for me it didn't need to be, and that's probably what pissed so many people off. Another thing, the movie was released at a very unfortunate time: right after Shazam, and right before Endgame. It was destined to be pooped on, which is too bad.

151,scb_coldsteel,A completely unnecessary and poorly made reboot,3,12 April 2019,"So I just saw the new Hellboy at the theater. I really enjoyed the previous versions of the film, but I was willing to give the director Neil Marshall a shot. Unfortunately this movie was just all around bad on every possible level. It may be a contender for worst reboot and all around one of the worst films of 2019.The plot of the movie saw Hellboy and his ragtag group of allies try to stop an evil witch from bringing on the apocalypse. Of course as the film progressed the world expanded in a number of not so interesting directions. It was a world filled with one dimensional characters, poor dialogue, subpar CGI, juvenile gore, and all around bad action scenes. It just wasn't a fun experience and the source material deserved better.So of course the plot was terrible. It was a thrown together cliche ridden example of how to kill a reboot on film number one. I was so bored the entire time with this film. There was just absolutely nothing intriguing about the plot of the film on any level. There was a central conflict, but it was so shallow it just could not hold my attention. The sad attempt at humor and horror were also all around insulting. On top of all of that the pacing was terrible. Everything was just a mess.So with a watered down plot you would expect there at least to be some great action and world building to keep the audience entertained on some level? Unfortunately the film made the odd choice of adding very little actual action to the film. The action sequences we did see were just not good and felt like something out of a TV movie. The additional gore just felt silly and really added nothing to the film of any merit. The same goes for the world building. With such a rich and interesting amount of lore this film really didn't care about making an interesting experience. Who exactly was this film made for? Who was even asking for it to be made?I am genuinely confused with the directors choices for this film. It was as if Neil Marshall wanted to set out to burn the franchise into the ground. All of the interesting components that made Guillermo del Toro's version so fun have been stripped away and instead we were left with a sad and generic reboot. Hellboy deserved better.The same goes for the poor CGI in this film that just further made the poor screenplay seem even worse. There was nothing unique about the visual choices, which is a shame considering the original Hellboy. Gone are the practical effects of the original and in their place we get some truly cheesey and generic set pieces. It all felt so heartless.The acting in the movie really didn't work either. I'm a bit biased because Ron Perlman was perfect, but David Harbour just didn't have the screen presence required for this role. It certainly didn't help that near all of his dialogue was just bad. Not B movie fun bad, but simply bad. The same goes for all of the secondary characters. Everyone was just sleepwalking through the poor script particularly Milla Jovovich who just needs to stop acting at this point.Overall Hellboy was a great example of how not to make a reboot. There just wasn't anything in the film that worked. It wasn't interesting or entertaining. In every way it was a step down from the original 2004 film. This is what happens when you have people make movie that just don't care about the core content. You make me sad Hollywood. A 2.27 out of 10.",Hellboy

Hellboy's new design is not bad, even though I think the previous one is better, I did like this one. That's in terms of look, the character itself here was quite bad, very dumb, all the time making bad jokes and swearing (I don't mind a few, but this felt like too much at one point, just silly), inconsistent in the battles in terms of power and abilities, and most annoying of all, very whiny.
I also liked the use of rock music, even if it was a bit off some times, and it didn't go well with the scene.
Don't get me wrong, I do like way more the previous two movies, but that didn't made me parcial on enjoying this movie or not, I really wanted to like this one, but it's just the poor story line, cheap dialog, poor secondary characters, poor acting and sometimes very bad CGI that makes me write these lines, its own merit.
I know it's supposed to be an action movie, but this was just poorly written over a lousy excuse of a story to concatenate action scenes with no pace or any sort of background or character development.
Quite bad overall, I don't want to dilapidate it, so I'll give it points for the great level of gore, some of the action, some (wasted) monsters designs at the ending, some of the music and Hellboy's look.

The acting is not great at all. Milla Jovovich doesn't even seem like she knows she is in a movie, and all the side characters are so boring that the actors were just sleeping through their roles. All, besides David Harbour. You can tell he cares about this character and he was having fun portraying him.
Although the effort of the director and the talent of the actors, the movie lacks the charm of the Guillermo del Toro duology. The movie is more faithful to the comics, but it also tries to be faithful to the previous movies and it just becomes a mess. There are so many little mistakes that make it past editing as well. I'm not going to go through them all, but the two that stood out the most both happen during the giant fight scene. Check it out.
Overall, this movie is not worth a first viewing let alone me watching it again. If it wasn't for David Harbours charisma as the main character, I might have shut the movie off halfway through.

From beginning to end this film was pure garbage, and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. Formulaic script, cheesy dialog, bad acting (Oddly enough none of these seemed to really matter in the first two films, both of which I rated at 10 Stars!) were all it took to send this POS directly to the Round Bin at Walmart. And there it will remain forever!",Hellboy
158,arabnikita,SEND IT BACK TO HELL!!!,4,13 April 2019,"SEND IT BACK TO HELL! Another remake and another trainwreck. Seems like nothing is safe nowadays even terrific, stylish and immersive movies by Guillermo Del Toro. I almost felt like I was watching Transformers the Last Knight.From the cheap looking prologue all the way until the credits there is an absolute lack of pacing. The writers tried to cram waaaaay to much into this movie mixing everything from King Arthur to Russian Folklore with Hell and iPhones in the middle of it. The movie cant establish an atmosphere or flow by constantly transitioning between places, colors, light and darkness. Everything is rushed, half-hearted and poorly executed.While David Harbour does look like Hellboy, he lacks any character or charisma that Ron Perlman had. He is supposed to be from HELL, not a whiny boarding school. The film is full of excessive and poorly used profanities and violence that just feel out of place and make it look even worse. Humor is flat and cheap. Fight sequences are done well and that is it! Colossal disappointment and an insult to the original film. Watch at your own risk.#moviesshmovies",Hellboy

I rarely walk out of the cinema before the ending of a film... but this was a torture... the plot, the script, the characters, everything in this movie and comic are always so BAD! SO BIZARRE AND OUT OF CONTEXT! NOTHING HAS SENSE!! I cant get why people like it, I mean, 99% of those must be possers, but the other 1% Im pretty sure they like it for real, and that's so sad, how people like a such an uncharismatic character?? Maybe because they see something that doesnt exist in reality and they are confused, anyway, -10/10, IMDB doesnt let negative notes or 0, so, sadly I have to give it a 1/10 :( But I really do want my money and time back, cause this was a waste!",Hellboy
160,achyutaghosh,Not for the faint hearted,7,16 April 2019,"Ah Hellboy! What did you do?We waited 11 years for you. We still thought that even though there will be no Perlman or Del Toro for the third movie, the Hellboy reboot could turn out interesting given the David Harbour and Neil Marshall team up, and the wealth of stories to be told from the Dark Horse comic books. Well, the interesting bits in 2019's Hellboy are not for all, and the Perlman and del Toro shoes are too big for Harbour and Marshall.Funnily it starts off ludicrous enough as a sword and sorcery tale in the Dark Ages. King Arthur's magical sword Excalibur is probably the most popular sword in the world- Michael Bay filched it for Transformers Last Knight and here it is again, putting evil (in the form of a sorceress Blood Queen Nimue) to rest. All that poor Nimue wants, like most evil characters, is to rid the world of humans and then rule, but she is cut to pieces and hidden all around England.Cue to present day, where Hellboy hunts a missing agent who has been turned into a vampire. Hellboy handily stakes him, but something is causing the age of monsters upon us it seems, and it is not the titular horned destroyer of worlds. Seems a Gruagach's revenge on Hellboy is to be achieved by bringing Nimue back to life. Baba Yaga- Hellboy's nemesis features and Hellboy ups his investigation and this leads to the best action set-piece in the movie- an ultra violent fight with 3 giants. However it ends fast, and the film does not have any sequence that touches the highs as this one does.Hellboy quickly moves to make his own team (Alice- the good witch, and Ben- the were-jaguar), and a showdown between Nimue and Hellboy is imminent when she attacks London with a plague. Hellboy has to attain his true demonic state to rid the world of Nimue. This climactic battle is what the movie builds towards, but surprisingly it never happens. Expectations go crash, boom and bang- to quote Roxette.Baba Yaga: They will build statues of you from the bones of your enemies!
Hellboy: Gonna need a XXXX-ton of bones.Hellboy 2019 tries to pander exclusively to fans. It embraces it's R rating, and there is no holding back on the gore, the dismemberments, the endless spurts of blood, and chopped off heads, and the spilled out guts. It sure is not for the faint hearted- that we have to agree. And David Harbour does deliver on Hellboy's profanity infused sardonic wit. For most fans, these two factors are good enough. The violence may not be everything for all, especially it is a launch sandwiched between family friendly flicks such as Captain Marvel, Shazam and upcoming Avengers Endgame. The support characters are not as nuanced as del Toro's version, and the CGI is spotty at best.Like Shazam, Hellboy is a movie that has stayed close to it's source. However, Hellboy's source is a niche audience. If you are that audience, the movie is a blast (sans the anti-climatic climax). If you are not that audience, then stay away.

161,Come-and-Review,"Skip it, rewatch Hellboy I & II instead",4,11 April 2019,"Clearly, this movie was greenlit in hopes for another Deadpool-esque R rated success. Equally clearly, this film failed.Right from the very beginning, I felt most of what was happening on-screen cringy, cheesy, predictable, just not interesting enough. There's nothing original: instead of attempting at being different (as Del Toro's version did), it borrows stylistic elements from several superhero/action-horror films, and does so clumsily. There are too many repetitive scenes (narrative flashbacks for example), the action scenes are not-that-good, the gore is just nauseatingly persistent, and the music seldom seems to catch the tone any given scene was supposed to have, the editing had some serious issues that a casual viewer could detect easily.To conclude the movie's sole purpose is clear: there is no interest in creating a work of art or at least an entertaining movie. This is merely a product aimed to produce income.
The ending scene (which could have been an average first scene of any given sequel) implies a possible continuation. I pray that the quality of this film will dissuade producers from proceeding and it will allow a third Del Toro film to be greenlit, finally.",Hellboy
162,AziziOthmanMY,laughable plot,1,4 July 2019,I just could not stop myself from laughing in some scenes. the producers and the script writers don't really gives a s*** on this movie as long it gets to the theaters in time.,Hellboy

The script was good, it was unexpected. You could not predict every scene.
BUT it was too gory.
TOO GORYYY!!!
Especially the encounter with baba yaga. It gave me nightmares.
Why did they make it so gory?
It could have been so much better.
Of course hellboy1 was scary. But the reason it was scary was not the gore but the way it builded all the agony.
I enjoyed hellboy 2 better than all the films.
I surely prefered ron perlman for the role but after some time I got used to the new actor. Overall it is a good movie. But I hated the gore..",Hellboy
165,marc5477,Watching paint dry,3,10 July 2019,"Action was brisk but thats about all the good you will find in this flick. It many ways this follows the way the original comics were created. Those had no story (for the most part) and were just collections of artwork. I am not a fan of the Hellboy comics though I do acknowledge that the art was good. But without a story I never felt like I wanted to see what happens next or pick up more of his comic books. This movie felt the same way. It had no substance and by the end I didnt feel like I watched a movie. It felt like I was watching the paint dry on some freshly made artwork in a gallery. With movies I want a interesting story first and everything else is secondary which is where this film failed for me.The story is straight forward. A big baddie is put back together and as with the 1st film, tries to recruit Hellboy. Everything else follows the script of the 1st movie except for minor details. I know this was supposed to be a reboot but it really was not needed and it made the originals look like masterpieces when they really were just average themselves. Doubt there will be a sequel based on this movie despite what was hinted in the credit scenes.",Hellboy

Maybe you're just upset because its not a sequel to the early movies, maybe you genuinely didn't like it but its not a 1 star movie. Ignore every 1 star review. They're wrong.

170,haydenluz,Hellboy,3,7 July 2020,"Hellboy, directed by Neil Marshall, was a sad let down! Marshall has a credible backround when it comes to gory, gritty, rated R films, but this one was a miss on every level - it really felt like one big issue. There was no set story, everything felt so cluttered, jammed together, and improvised.The screenplay by Andrew Crosby wasn't very intriguing, or funny. This movie was gifted the R rating for the gore, and language, and they did not capitalize on that! All they gave us was some corny, inconsistent humor.I genuinely feel bad for David Harbour because he does try his best, but Ron Perlman trademarked the Hellboy character - Harbour even said himself that he didn't even want to do the part at first because there's nothing wrong with it. The only real issue I had with him, is that sometimes his dialogue was muffled, and tough to make out. I wasn't a fan of what they did with Professor Broom. His character is sincere and intelligent, and in this film, he's kind of arrogant. For the rest of the supportive cast, I particularly didn't care for anyone's preformance - they were all mediocre at best. These characters lacked the Del Toro feel and style.The action was very big, gritty, and gory. Some scenes were fun, but there was a lot of inconsistencies to say the least, with Hellboy's strength and power, and not for nothing, whoever designed Hellboy's rock hand, should be fired immediately.Overall, I can see where Marshall was trying to go with this, but it was very messy and a lot to take in. I'm very upset to say I really didn't enjoy this film.",Hellboy
171,domtaylor,It's not terrible.,5,4 May 2019,"Let me make it clear that 'Hellboy' (2019) is not a 'good' movie. It's poorly edited, the acting is pretty shoddy - apart from David Harbour, who is actually quite good in the titular role - and the narrative is extremely messy. It just doesn't seem to have a clear vision, and the studio interference is obvious when watching. It also feels quite long and the frequent flashbacks are almost painful, highlighting just how bad the storytelling actually is. It's also entirely unmemorable, which doesn't help. However, it's not all terrible. While it's never entertaining to a high degree, it's not exactly boring. The action sequences are decent, if overly CG, and there's enough going on to keep you somewhat interested throughout. The practical creature designs are visually pleasing, too, and Hellboy looks the part. It's certainly not the worst of the year, even if it is down there. Overall, it's just okay. 5/10",Hellboy
172,larosaj-26666,Critics were right on this one,2,26 July 2019,Usually critics are dementedly wrong but not this time. After all they loved the WORST movie of the 21rst century Get Out. Glad I didn't see this dreck in the theatre. Harbour was awful in the role. Half the time he sounds like the Dude in the Lebowski movie. I know Perlman was 70 so another actor was fine but he was just bad. Awful jokes. The movie looks like a higher budgeted Full Moon Production from the 80's with the silly looking monsters. Gore for gore's sake. Only Kim and of course Ian acquit themselves well. Stay away from this celluloid abomination.,Hellboy
173,maxmages,"This film is a strange, absurd mix of Transformers 5, King Arthur, Braveheart, and Men in Black.",3,4 May 2020,"Who is this film for? For children, the dialogues are the humorist for twelve-year-olds, the action is for 16-year-olds and the violence should be done to 18-year-olds.
There are no single quiet moments in this film and unfortunately nothing soulful either. All of them are just arguing and bickering like in my cousin's kindergarten group.
Elle are insulting themselves so that you ask yourself the question why they don't piss each other on the face and the whole film is just full of explanations and explanations that a better title would be ""call of exposicion"".
Of course, I know that this film is much closer to the comics, but that makes it all the worse that nothing really fits together here and that the things they changed just stand out like a soda thumb 300 is a one to one implementation works but without problems as a film.
the X-Men trilogy changed things 80% but works fine as films and even fans love them apart from part 3 (but that's a different story).
The action is pretty hectic and has a nimble spacing. I actually like brutal films but here there was just violence because of the violence and that's no fun.
Everything is strangely clapped together there you have Nazis, King Arthur, and in the next scene there are some policemen chasing demons and a pig demon into the prefabricated building and I remembered Transformers 5 very well.
And that speaks volumes if things are taken from the original source material in the same way and I have to ask myself the whole time whether I have skipped 20 times or just all are completely drunk.
Nobody in the film seems like a real threat to neither the heroes nor the shops, which is why I kept asking myself why they don't just call the police.
Milla Jovovich has never been a good actress but in this film she is so out of place that you could replace her with a mannequin because what she has delivered here already borders on refusal to work, the costumes are good, but everyone in the film just looked ugly .And there are so many small details that just seem wrong and out of place, which is why I am wondering whether either the film was originally supposed to go for 3.5 hours and just broken down on it or whether they wanted to make a completely serious dark film all underworld and just before Have noticed at the end how successful Deadpool is and had to jump on this train.",Hellboy

I think dave habour does what he can and when its just fighting on screen it mostly looks great but the rest of it is an extreme chore to get through.

177,tresm87,"Already underrated beyond belief, Neil Marshall's Hellboy adaptation is a visual blast full of ballistic action, malevolent monsters, and exciting fun throughout.",9,17 April 2019,"8.6/10 Apparently critics and haters alike decided once Del Toro/Perlman weren't attached to this new Hellboy adaptation, they made their minds up to hate it. While I enjoyed Del Toro's excellent stylistic take on Hellboy, I have to say this is superior in following subject matter, and nails the many colorful tones of the Mignola comics better.The story introduces us to the lovably insane Hellboy very well with an incredibly intense set of opening sequences, and immerses the viewers into his world very effectively. As things progress we get familiar with some fantastically executed origin stories that portray the comics perfectly, and it expands on so many different characters supremely. The overall story moves along well with some vibrantly brilliant creatures and ferocious fights. When everything unfolds it leads up to an epic finish full of excitement and bloodshed. Once again i have to say it followed the comics rather well and had some great personality and humor to it.As far as the acting performances go I was thoroughly surprised by how awesome David Harbour was as Hellboy. He was absolutely hilarious and captured the character so well with a wide array of emotions shown. The makeup was also fantastic on him though I was skeptical from the trailers. Ian McShane as Trevor/Dad was excellent as well and contrary to delusional critics they had great chemistry with each other. Milla Jovovich was beautifully sinister as the blood queen and honestly I'd like to see her as the villain more.The standout imo was the plethora of extremely detailed creatures/monsters throughout especially Baba Yaga. The sequence with her was horrifyingly marvelous. I didn't expect them to blend the paranormal/horror aspects so well but they definitely did. The gruesomeness and gore was prevalent and I thought it was fitting for the adaptation.For a few minor nitpicks, there are some moments where the cgi is a bit shoddy but it was usually solid. You can tell when they're using practical effects and they are amazingly well done. Obviously you can't use practical effects for giant monsters so I can cut them some slack. Also the soundtrack is a bit spastic with some interesting choices that worked at times and sometimes didn't.Overall it's a shame this was unfairly accosted which caused it to bomb massively. I would've loved to see where they went from here especially after what's teased at the end of this. Like I said,I believe this is going to go down as a very underrated film and might even develop a cult following hopefully. People don't know what they're missing out of stubbornness.",Hellboy

183,angiris,Has some issues but its a fun ride.,6,25 July 2019,"I can understand the hate it's getting but in my opinion most of it is overblown.The BadWonky dialog at times. Can feel a bit rushy, wording could've used more flow. The phase is off as well from scene to scene. It is pretty obvious that they had issues shooting because the transitioning leaves quite a bit to be desired.Hellboy's costume design was pretty good overall however I do believe it had some proportion problems now and again. He didn't look as big or broad as he should've during certain scenes.One too many jokes. Film tried to be a bit too marvel-esque and trying to make your audience laugh too much just ain't gonna work unless you use humor in your cinematography. Comedy however is entirely different because its far less organic and more forced. Thus ending up leaving your audience feeling asked to laugh instead of actually making them laugh.The GoodDavid's performance was super over the top and I liked it. I thought it was crazy good and different from Del Toro's which I appreciate. I am not going to compare the two films because I just welcome both existing.The action is great, we get to see more demon hellboy using his sword, actually killing Nimue with it at the end too which was very satisfactory. Let alone the definative R-rating which I applaud them for standing true by.We got severed heads, impaled corpses, big monsters, lots of evil and its great. It is as you'd expect from a movie about monsters and demons. And honestly we dont get enough of this because everything has to be a marvel PG 13 movie these days which I'm getting extremely bored of.
This is one of the reasons I welcome this flick. Because of the fact that is is different. Its own thing. Troubled but fun.Some of the humor is quite good. The destroying of his iphone, his over the top screaming whilst trying to be this bro-ish dude guy who just wants to kick back, have a few bears and chill. Hellboy here is such a cool guy. A very chill guy. Bit goofy, very overly dramatic and I like that. I personally enjoy this particular aspect of him over Del Toro's version because I felt like that Hellboy there began getting a bit too emotional. Too calm and romantic and it just didn't really feel right. I wanted to see more kicking butt and humorous but aggressive behavior and personality.This Hellboy however isn't having one bit of that. Its full-on screaming, anger frustration and wanting to just figure out his identity issue with being half human and half demon. Which is interesting and really well done too. This film knew what it wanted to be, it didn't have too many subplots going that interfered with the overall arc.
Minus the forced comedy from time to time.The ending of the film is spectacular. We get some real eye-candy and a solid emotional but fittingly so grand finale where Hellboy accepts who he truly is, gets a nice acknowledment from his father, something he was missing and its just such a great form of storytelling when its all rounded up.Be your own man. Dont let anyone manipulate you. Be strong, be fierce and dont let any presets affect who you truly want to be. It is your choice.
And thats a damn good message that I can get behind.A fathers love and a strong message to be a man.
A strong man with a strong spine.And no matter this film's phasing issues or unnecessary jokes from time to time, I ultimately look at this film and think 2 things:
I liked it, I want to watch it again.ConclusionQuite a ride. Lots of good, few bits of bad. But overall quite damn entertaining and it has personality. It has a good group of characters we can enjoy and follow around. Sadly held back by the phasing of the film. It would've been quite cool having a slow, sitting in the bar talking for 10 minutes. Discussing their powers, their backgrounds and such.Movies really need to do that kind of thing more these days. Its nice with some breaks with good dialog.
6 out of 10. Above average. A good movie. With nice replay value. If it hadn't had these phasing problems as well as given us some more time learning about the characters which Del Toro's films did better, I would've rated it 7. But alas, maybe there is hope for a sequel although I doubt it knowing the box office numbers.Just the same. I appreciate what we did get.",Hellboy

189,margulanabutrlov,Hellboy Review,7,23 May 2019,"When an ancient sorceress wants to take down the world, our only hope is a warrior demon from the depths of hell itself.
Hellboy (David Harbour) is raised by his adoptive father Professor Broom (Ian McShane) to work alongside humans in the Bureau for Paranormal Research (BRPD) - an organisation that protects people from otherworldly forces who threaten the planet. Hellboy's supernatural abilities are put to the test when the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich) is raised from the undead, in a bid to take revenge on humans who tried to destroy her ages ago. Neil Marshall's reboot of Guillermo Del Toro's two films based on this comic-book universe aims to set itself apart with a distinctly gory, and expletive-laden tone. Marshall understands how to stage large scale action set pieces, and there are a couple of sequences that are disturbing, yet hilarious. But there's little else of note.Milla Jovovich as the villain is bad, and not in a cheesy yet enjoyable manner. She struggles to convey the required sense of menace; her dialogue delivery fluctuates between wooden and comical. It also doesn't help that the Blood Queen is a weak antagonist who holds a lot of promise but doesn't quite bring it eventually. Meanwhile, David Harbour is perfectly cast as the lead character. Hellboy is mighty while being snappy with oodles of wit, and Harbour nails down his devilishly fun persona. Ian McShane also attempts to add some pathos to the distorted father-son relationship Professor Broom shares with Hellboy.Sadly, as soon as you begin to appreciate these sub-plots, the next action sequence is thrown at us. The tonality is wildly uneven which isn't helped as outrageous characters enter the narrative with little context, and often exit quickly as well. If Marshall's mere intent was to shock you with excessive gore and expletives, then he manages to do that. It isn't quite enough, especially if you leave the theatre confused about what just happened, due to a ludicrous plot. Despite McShane and Harbour's best efforts, this exhaustive 'end-of-the-world' story is unable to raise as much hell as it should.",Hellboy
190,ajzeg,Another 2019 movie that showed up for free from the library.,3,15 September 2019,"Now, I'm not a huge fan of the original Guillermo Del Toro Hellboy movies, I've only seen the first one, but I really like it. It's action-packed, it has great effects, it has fun characters and it's just a good movie. The 2019 remake is not a good movie. Like, it's not the worst comic book movie ever made, not by a long shot, but it just has an overall feeling of cheapness. Some of the action was okay and I like the design of some of the characters but that's about it as far as good things about this movie go. The story makes no sense, the characters are all boring and unlikeable and the effects are AWFUL!!!!!!! The prosthetics are okay, Hellboy looks fine (Except for the tail. It just hangs there and does nothing.) and I really liked this witch monster that shows up halfway through, but the CGI is some of the worst I've ever seen for a movie this recent. It looks like it's from the early 2000s, not 2019! It reminds me of Van Helsing or Underworld or Resident Evil. Remember those? It's just terrible! It also reminded me of Deadpool with all the violence and one-liners and it rips off the title cards that show the names of locations from the MCU movies. Clearly this movie is not as good as those. There are some good kills with lots of blood and guts in this movie and some wild monsters that show up that are actually kinda cool, but it's all CGI so I have to take points off for that. The music was also kinda distracting. Overall, there's just not much I have to say about this movie. It's bad, but I didn't hate it. If you just want to watch schlock, this isn't a bad choice. I actually think it's a little better than Venom. If you actually want a good movie, however, stick with the Del Toro films.",Hellboy

192,DeadMansTrousers,Coming from a longtime fan this was barely watchable,3,9 July 2019,I was extremely unsure about this one and I finally broke down and gave it a shot...I wish that I hadn't. This was just barely mediocre enough to keep on until the end. Everyone in this apart from Ian McShane and Milla Jovovich were horribly miscast. There were times when the acting was so bad I felt like I was watching a straight to dvd movie especially from the Major Ben character. The plot of the film was so rushed and sloppy it felt like it was written after they staged all the fight scenes as a second thought.I am a long time fan of the comics and the first two films and I would've loved to have seen the originally planned Del Toro third film with the original cast. This on the other hand isn't worth the time. Someone please hand me the bleach for my eyes...,Hellboy

SOO glad this movie is standalone! It's ACTUALLY WELL WRITTEN AND DEVOID OF POLITICAL BS -- Mostly.

196,Amthermandes,I think the haters are missing something,8,23 December 2019,"This is an excellent popcorn flick. Sure, the story is redundant and predictable, and yes, CGI seems to have stopped progressing a decade ago, and this is a fine example of it, but they used practical special effects more often than I thought they would, and overall it was much better than a lot of people were leading on.Don't focus on the sub-average CGI (which, also wasn't as bad as people make it out to be), don't focus on the easy plot and predictability, just enjoy the flick for what it is: a hippodrome of fantastical creatures, violence, fun, humor, and brutality. Yes, even the gore deserves some nods of approval, CGI or no. It's exactly what it markets itself to be, and that also deserves respect. It's not gonna lie to you and claim it deserves an oscar. It will, however, deliver on great screen-time entertainment. Bite me, haters.",Hellboy
197,Sunsphxsuns,NOTICE TO CRITICS AND HATERS - GIVE THIS FILM A FIGHTING CHANCE!,7,13 April 2019,"HERE WE GO: Let's get this out front right now - This is a fun film, and full of surprises. By the time the end credits began to roll, while enthused overall, I also felt uncertain and uneasy on several levels. But hey, isn't that what art is all about? It's the ""creation,""and not the ""explanation,"" that usually defines timeless art.THE GREAT: For me, this latest HB installment was an unexpected left turn into a darker, more foreboding Hellboy Universe. Even from the opening scene, it was clear that the overall tone would mirror Mike Mignola's graphic novels far more closely than the two previous films by genius director Guillermo del Toro. Director Neil Marshall certainly had his work cut out for him. Many of the CGI special effects were stunning, massive, over the top, yet beautiful in their own ""other worldly"" way, and as expected we were treated to several bloody confrontations between Good and Evil, with the main prize being Earth and all its inhabitants. And if the ""bad guys"" were afforded an opportunity to explain why they ever decided to migrate over to the dark side, they'd probably respond in unison: ""Hey, it isn't our fault. The Devil made us do it!""The GOOD: The acerbic humorous dialogue between the evil guys and Hellboy are excellent ice-breakers, neatly threaded into the mystical fabric of a somewhat complicated (often confusing) plot. David Harbour did an admirable job filling the giant shoes (and massive right claw) of Ron Perlman's original character. Taking over the role of Hellboy, already firmly established in the two previous films, could not have been an easy task. The general flavor of Hellboy is still in residence with this film. At times, however, it felt like much of Hellboy's more jocular dialogue appears to have been intentionally inserted into the script to keep a younger (and ravenously hungry for this anticipated installment) audience graphically entertained. Yet at other times there seemed to be ""softened dialogue"" inserted, ostensibly to lighten the impact of some particularly gruesome visuals such as human bodies being shredded alive, or crushed beneath the feet of a trio of Troll-like, flesh-eating giants. I had to lean over to my wife 3-4 times during these scenes to sheepishly apologize for taking her to such a violent film. While violence doesn't generally bother me, the excessive gore was a bit much. The secret is out - Hellboy 3 is a very graphic, violent movie, but at times, some genuine heart and warmth manages to shine through. For me, those were the best moments.THE SAD: Are you kidding, HB's father had to die again? And was HB's kindly father actually a part of a devious WWII plan to search out Hellbaby and kill him at the first opportunity? WTF? Why kill your adopted son? Because the prophesy mandates that ""Hellboy will ascend to his original dark mission to initiate the destruction of the World and all humans in it? For me, this became a disconnect and created a cinematic void. Milla Jovovich as Nimue/The Blood Queen was an odd casting choice. She is a magnificent actor (think Fifth Element) but this role seemed to unintentionally mock her own screen identity. Because of the new plot device, and the departure of nearly everything I'd come to love in the first 2 films, I suddenly found myself missing Ron Perlman's deep, gravel-like voice; Doug Jone's wonderful (and slimy) Abe Sapien; and Selma Blair's complicated relationship as Liz Sherman, the fire-starter love of HB's life (and not to mention the soon-to-be mother of their yet to be born twins!). Oh, Jesus! Did I mention I love Hellboy? I do - but this was a different HB than I had anticipated. Perhaps this wide departure from the first 2 films was necessary in order to get the film made?THE FINAL WORD: My recommendation: If you really want to full-out enjoy this newest installment of this still very entertaining franchise, try to forget you saw the first two films, because you will find, almost immediately, that the two original scripts, plot lines, and characters, have very little in common with this latest endeavor. Many of the pieces are still there, but glaringly MIA in this chapter. No pregnant girlfriend, no twins waiting to be born, and no Abe, Hellboy's amphibious friend and confidant. It's a different film, and many say it's more true to the themes found in the graphic comics of the same name.Wherever this franchise ends up, I hope we will see more of what we always love best about these characters - their genuine love for each other, their strong commitment that when things ""go bump in the night, the agency will always be there to bump back.""",Hellboy
198,shimenpf,Boring and messy,5,17 April 2019,"Many of the scenes filled with conflict in the movie were interesting and even exciting. There were also some nice small twists and revelatuons. Sadly, all of that is a minority. Most of the film is built upon extremely expository scenes where other characters explain things to Hellboy and that's just tedious and boring. The plot is messy. Hellboy's goal isn't really that clear. Does he want to stop the witch? Does he loves the witch? It's hard to follow. Some scenes start too early, which makes them boring. The third act is very weak. The climax, particularly, where Hellboy ""fights"" the witch, which is more like a debate between his father's spirit and the witch, trying to convince him over which is the right choice. Overall, the movie had some light in it, but most of it is just bad.",Hellboy

200,thisseatofmars,"Go see it, you'll have a ""heck"" of a time. (Sorry, it was low-hanging fruit.)",8,13 April 2019,"The original Hellboy movies are good, but not del Toro's best. His best is Pacific Rim, a superb, sublime work of robot and monster art, while his worst is Shape of Water. In ranking del Toro's movies, Hellboy is something like 3rd best, maybe after The Devil's Backbone (Pan's Labyrinth is overrated, sorry). I bring this up because it's unfair to scream and bawl that del Toro didn't direct this new Hellboy movie. From what I'm seeing online, people are shaming this new director, Neil Marshall, for having the *audacity* to even *think* about adapting Hellboy. And, before seeing the film, I have to confess that I was in sort of in agreement. I've seen one other movie by Marshall and wasn't impressed by it. The corny trailers and David Harbour bellowing at the Emmy's (or whatever award show that was) didn't do anything to help either. However, I saw the movie today after work and I'm happy to say that this new Hellboy movie is a lot of fun.The original Hellboy movies changed too many elements for my liking. Making Hellboy a government conspiracy and Liz a love interest felt uninspired. This new Hellboy movie takes more after the comics, in that the world knows who he is and don't freak out when they see him walking around. What was never in the comics, however, was the level of profanity that's in this movie. I guess they were really pushing for the R rating? I don't understand it. The Hellboy comics quote Shakespeare, Dickens, Blake, and Melville, some huge heroes of my heart. This movie meanwhile swore so much I thought grandma had come back to life and had had a hand in writing the screenplay.But I can't complain. Seeing Hellboy onscreen again is a treat: moving, fighting, shooting; the character looks fantastic, except for some moments where the horns move a little too much on his head and the makeup looks smudgy (but these are rare moments). I liked the humour, like Hellboy's hairy back, and action too. I've read a few criticisms about the level of gore in this movie, but I think the gore adds, strangely. I'm no gore hound, but the gore in this movie ""good gore,"" the kind you hear in campfire stories. (""Bad gore"" is gross, like the torture scenes in Hostel, or all of Get Out.) It's like the filmmakers were trying to adapt the Hellboy comics but also pulp horror films, like the Hammer series, and other comics too, like Tales from the Crypt and Creepshow.Ian McShane is a great actor, a truly charismatic dude, and Milla Jonovich is as elegant and charming as ever. David Harbour is not especially striking in any capacity, but he does Hellboy justice, delivering the dry one-liners and annoyance of having to save the world well. The movie clips along and delivers information at a rapid-fire pace, so there's never a dull moment. Really, this isn't a bad movie at all. In fact, I even hope we get sequels. Maybe even a trilogy this time around, instead of a duology.It's weird, people jumping on the hate bandwagon, with this movie. It makes me think of Venom, from last year. Movie critics (unhappy people with pretentious clothing and appearances) hated Venom but moviegoers enjoyed it, myself included. Hellboy's getting the same kind of unwarranted treatment, but it's actually a lot of fun. Go see it! You'll have a ""heck"" of a time. (Sorry, it was low-hanging fruit.)",Hellboy
201,ryanwinning1,Hellboy was a lot better than I expected!!,8,20 October 2019,"As I started watching the latest Hellboy, I pulled up some of these reviews to let me know what kind of movie I was getting myself into. I scrolled for a while, but found nothing but negative reviews! It was like everyone hated this movie but me! I give it an 8/10 because it kept me entertained for the full 2 hours. I see a lot of reviews call out the ""Horrible CGI,"" but I've seen waaaaaay worse and choppier. I would honestly call this movie a non-stop thrill ride, but with some nice comedic moments here and there, as well as scary and gory bits. I thought I'd never see a movie quite like ""Van Hellsing"" ever again(I loved that movie) but this one is definitely in the same sub-genre of horror-action.

But with that said bringing King Arthur into the story line, even if it's in the comics to which I don't know because I've never read a comic in my life, is still not good and made the movie not so good.

205,midnightcub,Well that was awful,4,16 April 2019,Truly terrible. I wasn't a huge fan of the first but at least it was really well done. But The Golden Army was absolutely fantastic. It really forced Hellboy to question his loyalties. That's SUPPOSED to be the idea here. But the villains are so truly horrendous her really never has to choose.The actors all do well with what they're given. But what they were given was crap. And the fact the CGI crew absolutely mimicked Del Toro (from Hellboy to Pans Labyrinth) for their designs (despite saying they didn't) makes you yearn for that Hellboy 3 by Del Toro and Perlman.The ONLY truly good thing to come out of this would've been for them too admit their mistake and make Hellboy 3.

Not that she did a bad job, just her character wasn't that interesting.If you're a diehard Hellboy fan; I'm sure this movie enraged you especially if you were team Perlman.

I was so sad and disappointed that they cancelled his third Hellboy film and because of that, they had to make a reboot.So of course they had many opportunities to make something good and probably take examples and inspiration from del Toro's films, but unfortunately it wasn't the thing that i was hoping for. To be honest: it was very terrible. There were so many things that didn't work that made the movie a huge mess and those were the weak story; bad dialogue; acting that was almost bad; uninteresting characters; bland cinematography; horrible effects and horrendous music. The hugest positives that i can give are:
David Harbour did a great job with his performance of Hellboy and because of him, his character was the most entertaining aspect, but it did had some moments that i couldn't understand what he was saying. Probably because of the makeup that he has.The sound was very well done.So yeah. Those were the only things that i liked.

212,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Hellboy: Welcomed or Rebuffed?,6,7 January 2020,"Here we go again! This week we have Hellboy and what a doozy this was. Let's begin with this film having a hard time being made in the first place. Stories of it initially being a sequel to the original installments fell through and led to this reboot. Either way, the movie was completed and off to the theaters people go. DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE ANYTHING LIKE THE FIRST TWO MOVIES. DEFINITELY R-RATED.Let's start with the good. Visually, at times, the monsters and demons displayed were absolutely amazing. Sickening but amazing. Truly creative and sick minds brought the words of the graphic novel to life. If anything saves this movie, that is it. These creatures are very cool and I would say pretty awesome to see on a big screen. This movie also plays better/closer to a horror/gore movie than the first installments. There are a couple good action sequences. I can see how people will enjoy that. HOWEVER...It's time for the bad and the ugly. Granted I never read the graphic novels, this movie's plot was the definition of discombobulated. The team that produced this throw everything, except the holy bible, at this movie. The producers of this movie are presumptuous that all viewers have full knowledge of Hellboy, and that isn't the case. The writing, was pretty awful and didn't help make anything better. This movie has you learning five different storylines that weren't really that important to give you minor details that don't really affect the larger story, in this particular movie. They seem to be setting up a second next movie that in my estimation may never come. Hellboy (the character) doesn't look that great (visually) and not as relatable or fun as the first installment. The other main characters are also weak, at best.With, that said Hellboy graphic novel fans... this movie isn't great but I can definitely understand you all wanting to see this and the creatures created... at best do a matinee. EVERYONE ELSE, wait for this to be on netflix and save your duckets. It would be cool to see the creatures on the big screen but not worth the money or time.

The plot is generic and paper-thin ultimately leading to a very underwhelming third act.The casting is really good and a handful of moments do make this one almost worth recommending but it is let down in the end by a very by the numbers plot and disappointing finale.,Hellboy

Much of it is beyond the pale ... what you'd expect walking in to a R-rated movie. Based on the tone throughout this fillem I think it highly logical that the conclusion was reigned in a good deal.

215,Exiled_Universe,BEST HELLBOY MOVIE BUT HAS MAJOR PROBLEMS!,8,10 August 2019,"Ok so first off when i saw the trailer i was so excited and happy and i just could not wait to see this movie and i was like this is what hellboy is supposed to be, gore,cursing, and menacingness, not all that pg-13 stuff from the first two i mean dont get me wrong but this movies is good. Ive seen bad reviews on it and i was like how can this be bad the trailer was awesome and the ring scene in the intro is so cool especially the first 6 seconds when hellboy first steps inside the ring. So after 1 week later i have finally seen the movie and to be honest im kinda iffy on it, i mean its definitely better than the first two for all the gore and good effects for a hellboy movie but most of the movie is kind of boring and pointless. I mean i followed the story good and it was kind of a fun adventure but at some points i was like come on wheres the action. Now most if not all the action takes place in the first half hour but there is an ending scene that shows a cool john wick style scene and i like the fact that they added abe sapien at the end. I couldn't tell if this was a sequel or a prequel i was thinking this throughout but in the end i dont care. The jokes and things were good and it was nice to have some new heroes other than the other two from the first two. This is a very controversial to me but i definitely dont hate it and i love it.

I've enjoyed watching it. There was plenty of action, nice atmosphere, some impressing gore/splatter scenes... And most of all, finally we got some (forgotten) practical special affect (instead of CGI).
Besides that Hellboy's figure is more ""realistic"" and aggressive compared to its predecessor. Just take a look at the old and new design... especially the face ;)
David Harbour (Hellboy) also did a great job... and it was not easy taking into account Ron Perlman's performance.
All the complaints regarding this version reminded me about the fate of Van Hellsing (2004) with Hugh Jackman. A a great brainless fantasy action movie that most of the viewers wanted to be an intellectually enlightening experience.So... if you enjoy action just give it a chance.

218,chrisstetz,Far better than expected - awful dialogue though,7,1 November 2019,"Hellboy is nowhere near as bad as the picture that some of the negative publicity has painted.
There's a lot to like here, it just seems that some movies are destined to be met with an wave of positivity or negativity upon release that they never shake. Hellboy falls firmly into this category, with the negative reaction being completely over the top.The biggest issue is the dialogue. It's really poor. Really uncreative, with lines that would have come across as cliched 25 years ago, never mind in 2019. It's really lazy writing, and the fact that the plot itself is actually very good, is likely down to the fact that it has such a wealth of great source material to draw from; it takes so much from the Mignola books that the movie never gets boring because there is so much happening.The direction, effects and look of the movie are superb. Marshall has done what he can here with a poor script. Hellboy looks great, particularly with his transformation.
A two hour blockbuster is normally a slog for me to get through these days, but this is such a relentless romp that I never got bored.
It's also very difficult not to feel for Hellboy, so beyond the relentless action, they have done well to achieve an emotional layer in such a short space of time in a movie that also needs to devote a lot of run time to action and horror scenes. Credit to Harbour as well for bringing this into his performance underneath all the make up and prosthetics.As usual you'll see a lot of extreme views on IMDB, ratings flipping between 1 and 10. In truth this is neither a great film or a terrible one, but one worth your time if you enjoy this sort of thing.",Hellboy
219,BibChr,"Bailed after 39 minutes, which is 34 too long",1,27 November 2020,"There is just so much to hate about this movie, which at 39 minutes showed not the least glimmer of hope for improvement.First, the deliberately-pursued ""R."" That was so they could throw in gratuitous obscenities and more gore. Did it make for a better movie than del Toro's two PG-13's? In no way.Then there's the absolutely, absolutely TERRIBLE makeup for the titular character. Perlman's makeup was seamless. This is just rubbery and awful. It screams ""rubber."" The mouth is nearly immobile...and everything bunches up. Every time he moves or falls or rolls over, you see his body-suit unnaturally bending out. He sharpens his horn, and it wiggles around, because obviously it isn't growing out of his skull.Then there's just the character. He is stupid and clueless from the first seconds, not a savvy agent who's done this his whole life.I could go on and on, and I only endured a quarter of the movie.Do yourself a favor, and don't even do that. Just watch del Toro's vastly-better movies. The people involved in this one clearly have no clue what made them as good as they are...unless they deliberately set out to do the opposite.",Hellboy

223,drmuhammedsamiduru,"Not too good, Not too bad, Average movie",5,3 June 2020,"In the movie, you get drowned in monsters, magic, fantasy, blood, legend. However, this drowning can turn into almost real drowning. Because after a certain period of time, transitions that give bad taste and chaos ""Come on, tie this to a result."" I can say that it has nothing to do with the previous movie. If you have a lot of time, watch. Or don't open it...The film flows very fast, there is constant movement and tempo, no time to talk to breathing. Lots of blood, head and arms are flying in the air. It seems like he's been exaggerated. Because of these features, the movie is a bit tiring. The score is in place. For those who raise the tempo, it can be viewed for entertainment purposes.It's not as good as Hellboy with Roy Pearlman, but it's as dark and bloody as his comic. I must also admit that David Harbor looked more like a drawing. But the first two movies are better.As an extra, there is an explosion in the sound. It is as if they opened the sound to the end and recorded it on the same sound again. Something like tearing sound. The movie isn't bad. I'm not a fan of Hellboy, the effects were beautiful.It is not quality enough to replace the first two films. Even its budget has been kept low compared to other films. The director is not Del Toro, of course, in this movie. They said let's pull Hellboy all over again. They made changes. Although they made the movie again, they skipped the details in the first movie and entered the sequel on his head. But they changed the flow of the movie. As if they were a little unsure about what to do. The movie doesn't seem to have attracted much attention at the box office. Watched but watch the first 2 movies first.Personally, I liked the 2nd movie, Hellboy (Golden Army) more. This movie is also okay, making itself watched. But I think the bad character is a little weak. The director, who could not process his goals and reasons well. For example, the evil character was very beautifully worked in the Golden Army. The purpose and reason of the evil character to fight for good reasons were explained to us very well. The better the bad character in a superhero movie, the better the movie.

226,Wirxaw,So bad that it's actually quite good.,6,9 July 2019,"I can't believe I'm saying this... but, yes, sometimes too bad can be good. At least the movie isn't pretentious, political, racial and whatnot. It tries to be all Devil May Care and... it succeeds. It's not a great movie, it doesn't lick the toes of Del Toro's original, but... I mean... We've had reboots of Star Wars... Jurassic Park... Terminator...Transformers... We've had the latest Marvel and DC movies, all the Wooden Women and Semen, Shizzam and Captain Feminist. We've had the bloody all-female Ghostbusters, and, yes, I know we don't talk about that one.So... Next to all of them... I don't know. I guess my standards have been lowered SO much, so very, very much that I... I guess this movie made me giggle sometimes, it didn't really try to be anything other than an ""edgy"" movie. It had some decent actors, somehow I didn't dislike Hellboy as much as I thought I would.Look, it is a mess. A mess of plotholes, things that make zero sense, contradict themselves or are just for the eye candy. And it can not have a good rating, because... obviously if you try to be as bad as you can - there's only *so* much good that you can get. But this ""mess of plotholes, zero sense and so called bad CGI""... it applies to EVERY single reboot I listed before. And I'll say it straight - I enjoyed this one more than any other reboot. The original duology wasn't exactly... promising, it was basically a proof of concept, a proof that Toro used to make great movies. Until he straddled for Shape of Jellybean, that is, but then again - even Nolan has fallen with Dunkirk.But this movie... Something about it itches in just the right place, just the right way. Is it that I like folklore? Slavic and non-slavic myths? Is it the Witcher vibe? Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing? Is it that I prefer honest to god gore and dismemberment to pussified Wolverine in Logan? I actually want to see the sequel. I want to see Kos... Nevermind. I want to see where will these guys go, what monsters would they fight. It's almost like the latest Ghostbusters, just... without all the BS. Or at least some kind of BS.It's fairly sad that it flopped and might not be continued. Much worse movies fare better, because the audience is just too stupid to differentiate between the ""good bad"" and ""actually really bad"". Or the R rating is strong. This is no Deadpool, of course, but... It deserves some credit too.So, to summarize: is it a good movie? No. But is it a ""bad"" movie? No. To quote Ralph from Wreck-it-Ralph: ""I'm bad, and that's good, I'll never be good, and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be... than me."" It's a movie worth watching if you aren't squeamish and have a penchant for gritty folklore. It's a movie that is technically not worse than some Oscar-shilling Black Panther or Shape of Jellybean, let alone the acclaimed Wooden Woman, Aquaman, even Logan, especially Logan. Because it's all bullsh.... All of it. Every single cell of these movies is utter and despicable BS. Every single of these movies is an atrocity that only sees the life of day because it's profitable. And in the light of these standards - what more can I ask than something I don't see every day? And I don't see Hellboy every day.",Hellboy

229,lord-blade,"It's okay, but the original movies did it better.",6,3 September 2020,"On its own, this new release of Hellboy is an adequate action movie. Some decent scenes, a couple of the jokes land alright, there some interesting moments. But overall, it's only about the level of the ""made of TV"" movies you find on SiFi and such. Nothing too special, but a fair enough way to waste an afternoon.The main issue is, the original Hellboy movies did everything this one did, but did it all so much better. The writing was vastly superior, as was Perlman's acting. The story was more engaging, and actually had a sense of urgency. In this one, they're given a deadline to save the world... but then it turns out something else has to happen too... and then something else has to happen too... it basically destroys any feeling of consequence. The heroes can screw up as much as they want because there's always something else that needs to happen, so who cares? You never feel like there's any real tension.The special effects were okay. Far too reliant on CG unfortunately. The original again did a far better job with relying on prosthetic and makeup effects. Movie makers need to learn that less is more. Unless your entire movie is animated, then use as little CG as possible otherwise you just make everything look fake as hell.If the movie's on TV and you get a chance, maybe sit down and check it out.

234,rustonreviews,In a word: awful.,2,18 April 2019,"Guillermo del Toro's proposed Hellboy III remained in development hell for years following his highly imaginative Hellboy II: The Golden Army in 2008. In 2017, del Toro announced on Twitter that the long awaited third instalment would never come to fruition. To add insult to injury, Lionsgate revealed that a reboot (without del Toro, Ron Perlman, or anyone involved with the previous films) would be released instead. As a huge del Toro fan, I was not impressed. Del Toro's Hellboy films, based on the gothic horror comic book series by Mike Mignola, are some of his very best works, so the complete cancellation of his planned third instalment was a real shame. Though I remained adamant I'd be boycotting this reboot, I felt obliged to give it a fair chance once I learned that Neil Marshall (director of The Descent (2005) and Dog Soldiers (2002)) would be taking up the directors' chair.Hellboy (Harbour, taking over the reins from Perlman), along with several recruits from the B.P.R.D, must work together to prevent Blood Queen Vivian Nimue (Jovovich) from bringing about the apocalypse. From the very get go, it is made clear that Marshall's reboot is an entirely different beast compared to del Toro's previous efforts. Marshall and co. fully embrace the gothic horror of Mignola's wildly popular source material, but ultimately end up creating one of the biggest comic book misfires ever to disgrace the silver screen. Astonishingly, Hellboy is a catastrophic mess from start to finish, and reeks of studio interference.Harbour (known primarily for his work in Stranger Things) gives it his all as the titular character, but doesn't capture any of the wit, charm, or the longing to fit in that Perlman portrayed so brilliantly with his incarnation of the character. There is something spectacularly hollow about Harbours embodiment of Hellboy, and at no point in the film did I ever feel invested in his character. Unfortunately, the same can be said about his two companions. Alice (Sasha Lane), a gifted clairvoyant, and Ben (Daniel Dae Kim), a B.P.R.D agent, are both flat characters with no character arcs to speak of, and they provide little to no screen presence at all. Alice had potential to be an interesting addition to the film, but she's written so blandly that she leaves no impression whatsoever. Ian McShane was a suitable Professor Broom, but when it really boils down to it, there's just no replacing the brilliant John Hurt. One of the weakest links of the film is its villain. Jovovich appears to be having great fun as Nimue (a brilliant character in Arthurian legend), but she's a painfully one dimensional antagonist who lacks true malevolence.Visually, the film lacks a distinct style. The cinematography is staggeringly bland, and the action sequences lack awe and wonder, and feel hideously chopped together and rushed. A sequence involving three giants battling Hellboy in a field could have been an exciting set piece, but is instead presented to us in an astoundingly dull manner, as are most of the action sequences presented in the film. Whereas del Toro brought a dark poetry and haunting beauty to his vision of Hellboy, Marshall opts for full on over-the-top gore and carnage, which wears thin pretty quickly. Cosby's script feels achingly disjointed, with a story that falls completely flat on its face and sequences that feel awkwardly Frankensteined together.Scrapping del Toro's Hellboy III in favour of this atrocity was a huge mistake. Del Toro is a man who understands monsters better than any other filmmaker working today; he understands what makes them scary, what makes them beautiful, and how to have his audience connect with them. With this reboot, everything feels so annoyingly redundant. It's a boring, uninteresting, forgettable comic book romp. Avoid.",Hellboy
235,darrenbjones,Imperfect but great fun.,7,28 January 2020,"Hellboy has come in for a lot of flack, rumours of production problems, on set arguments and rewrites during filming. It has also been lambasted by fans of the two earlier movies who wanted the (at that point) 69 year old Ron Perlman to return to the role with original director Guillermo del Toro.
Anyone who has watched the first two honestly, must agree that they aren't masterpieces. The first was a stylish hot mess and the second, while much better, wasn't perfect either.
This third outing for the Dark Horse comic book character is a reboot and the character is supposed to be younger, angrier and less sure of his heroic path. He takes on an ancient evil, the witch Nimue, who is intent on bringing the demons and monsters forced into hiding by mankind back into the light.
It's fun, the plot moves as breakneck pace, exploring the world of Hellboy through the BRPD agency tasked with protecting the world, regular, blissfully unaware humans, monsters living just outside their view and arrogant, rich white men who see monster hunting as modern day fox hunting.
It's all entertaining, the language is coarse and the action is bloody. It's also bloody fun, better than Hellboy's first outing and at least as good as Golden Army. It's not going to win any awards but it's worth your time if you like violent comic book fare. David Harbour is good as Hellboy, Ian McShane and Milla Jovovich always offer solid performances.

So generally, I was thinking that for the film to be an actual 5.2, it had to get really bad.Well, parts of it did.While I disagree that the CGI was bad (I actually thought parts of it were FANTASTIC), the PLOT was nonexistent and the DIALOGUE was just this side of a sixth-grader's school essay.That aside, the biggest problem I had with it, were the super-annoying sidekicks. The guy was mostly okay, but the girl was terrible. It was also FULL of those little things that I tend to notice which take me out of a movie, such as an extra who is supposed to be cheering, but looks more like they are lifting invisible 10 lb. weights in each hand, or the other extra who is looking right into the camera. HOW could the people responsible for editing these films, or anyone involved who watched the full cut not care enough to catch things like that?

258,sala151183,One 'Hell' of a bad film.,4,13 April 2019,"This film is not a good film, the only positive for me is David Harbour as Hellboy himself.
The humour just didn't cut it, the story was pointless and some of the acting was somewhat disappointing.
I found myself looking at the time because I simply wasn't enjoying what I was seeing,
I've walked out of a one film in my time and I get like I could of here.
Just a bad film.

260,Hex_0mega,Don't go by the hypercritical reviews,8,11 August 2019,"I have seen a lot of negative feedback regarding this remake, but I honestly really liked it! Sure, it had a little more CGI than I can usually really appreciate in a film, but even so it was great! A lot of people have been saying the story sucked but I really didn't see anything wrong with it. I mean, it wasn't perfect, but I think this movie is being underrated to put it lightly. I hope to hell it gets a sequel! Pun absolutely intended. I tend to enjoy gore effects in movies and this one brought that to the table with great style.One major thing that the movie left out was the dual blade wielding nazi soldier villain, which was a fan favourite in the Del Toro version. There was another character that was beloved by fans of the Del Toro Hellboys that was missing for this version and I won't spoil it, but he will undoubtedly be included in the sequel if it does indeed get one. I have never read the comics, but people have said that this one stays more true to them that Del Toro's. Just another reason I am baffled by the hyper hypercriticism. Ultimately though, I think it deserves an 8/10 with flying colors!",Hellboy

Yet another big blockbuster action movie based on a comic is the base of Hellboy. A few people had mentioned this movie before it came out and reassured me it would be good, but it was the opposite.

266,cameronjames-86959,Hellboy is a disappointing and awful movie,1,15 April 2019,"I don't like to hate on movies I really don't and to be honest I wanted to really like this movie I was really excited for this movie but after the first scene and the first line of dialog I knew what I was in for. Hellboy (2019) is trash it's awful it's not even a tiny bit good and there is no saving grace for this movie. Let me just state this now I have not seen the original hellboy movies I do want to, just haven't yet (I well be reviewing and ranking them) that being said I'm sure anything would be better than this movie. Here's my review.
Pros: David harbor and Sasha lane give it there all but sadly they can't save this movie. The practical effects looked good.
Cons: the opening scene was so cheesy I wasn't laughing because it was trying to be funny I was laughing because how bad it was. The fight scenes yes there is 2 decent ones but when this movie just starts to make the fight senses violent just for the sake of violence it gets alittle ridicoulus and yes this movie is R so sometimes my mouth went dropped because they went there but not in a good way because they just use the violence because they can and were rated R now and we can go there with the violence level. The music choices and the original soundtrack is just awful none of these music choices fit for the movie there aiming for. The characters expect for hellboy and Alice I hated none of them I cared for none of them were intreasting. This movie was so boring it's 2 hours long and it felt like i was dragging on. The acting was not good I don't if it was the script or not but the acting was bad yes David harbor and Sasha lane do try and they do a not awful job but they can't save this movie. By the way speaking of script what was this one it doesn't even seem like a script it's a jumbled up mess. The story is so confusing because there is like 5 different story lines. The Villian is TRASH not even remotely interesting. The cgi was bad and just were awful I wish they took more time to work on them because half of this film is just cgi and I'm not kidding cgi monsters, cgi magic, cgi blood, CGI EVERYTHING and it's not even good cgi.
Overall: I really wanted to like hellboy(2019) it looked good and fun and yes cheesy but I do enjoy cheesy movies, but leaving the theater I was in pure shock at how bad this movie was. This has to be the worst movie I have seen this year and the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I hate this movie it makes me angry just thinking about it. Hellboy(2019) is not just a disappointment of the year but a disappointment to movies in general. This movie almost made me walk out but I stayed in the theater and watched this movie because I was hoping it was gonna get better but it didn't. Don't see this movie pls don't support it at all. I wish I listened to the reviews and saw Shazam for a 3rd time instead. Hellboy(2019) gets a 1/10.",Hellboy
267,jpkwolf,A big gory mess (Very minor spoilers included),4,18 April 2019,"I was hyped for this film. Finally we were going to get a darker gorier ""proper"" Hellboy. Not to say the Guillermo Del Toro movies weren't good. They still look great and their characters were written with love and warmth. Their scripts coherent and good. Hellboy (2019) is almost the complete opposite of that.David Harbour does a pretty good job as Hellboy (Although maybe coming off too often as a bit whiny). That was evident from even the first trailer that crammed in 90% of the movies jokes and one liners. The other trailers give you most of the money shots, so there is almost only filler to see in the film. The movie begins in a decent way. Hellboy trying to locate one of his organisations agents. A fight ensues and soon we are taken to UK to fight giants in a well shot and actually quite entertaining battle scene. Later we meet creepy witch Baba Yaga in an atmospheric and actually quite creepy scene. Those are the highlights of the film really. The final battle gets apocalyptic only to fall flat and end in very cliche and anti-climatic way.The CGI is horrible reminding me of Van Helsing from almost 20 years ago. Though some models and scenes look much better than others, giving a feel that the movie was rushed out. The movie being also very CGI heavy like Van Helsing doesn't help. Also the script seems to jump from place to place and sometimes even from one tone to a different one quickly. The few scenes meant to be emotional then also falling flat especially when flavored with the bad CGI. In the end we get one more extra action scene that is shot very well like the giants battle scene making you think why we didn't see more of this during the actual movie.Lobster Johnson character was cool but he's more like a short cameo and we could have probably seen him more in the sequel we won't get. The movie also sadly builds towards the sequel with the appearance of another great cameo in the end.There's lots and lots of gore which was actually nice and f-bombs being dropped. Sad that the script is such a mess and clearly needed some rewrites. Also the producers apparently clashed with Neil Marshall, changes being made all the time during the production. So this is what we get. The worst Neil Marshall film. It's clearly no The Descent or Dog Soldiers and it's a much bigger mess than even Doomsday.This all is sad as there clearly was potential in this and especially in Harbours performance but the movie was rushed and producers apparently again wanted to be directors. So too many cooks make one disappointing Hellboy film.",Hellboy
268,JoeYabuki,Disaster movie,3,13 April 2019,"Performances are stupid and ridiculous. The OST is bad, the mix among them and the scenes are nonsense. CGI awful, it seems like a series B movie, one of those Sharknado from SyFy. The plot is terrible. The villain (the wild pig) is retarded, really dumb, Milla (The other villain who is a 1500-year-old witch) does what she can with what she got. The comedy is BAD. This film is like a 24-episode TV series, EVERYTHING IS TOO COMPRESSED AND SUMMARIZED in a bad way in sketches of 3 minutes, the assembly and editing are really bad, super cut with huge scissors, in the movie there are so many plots that it doesn't get anywhere.",Hellboy
269,jackdeth_2006,A lot of unfair reviews here I think,8,12 January 2020,This film suffered from being a reboot no one asked for...not because it wasnt a good film overall.It's a different take on Hellboy but not entirely dissimilar from the originals. Harbour does a good job in the role and McShane really makes the role his own.Unfortunately a lot of people love GDT's originals so much this film never had much of a chance.Put that aside though and theres a lot to like about this movie. Well scripted with some great action; enjoyable VFX and a world that feels very similar to the originals.It does have a problem with pacing from time to time; some chapters have non stop action but lead to lulls where not a lot of anything happens.Still a good movie though.,Hellboy

I really enjoyed David Harbour as Red, he's very funny and believable in the role, he brings something new to the character that is different then Ron Perlman, who I'm a huge fan of. Some would say I'm betraying the purity of Hellboy, because Its not Ron Perlman or Del Toro, honesty I don't care, it's not wrong to love this film, I mean Mike Mignola the creator praises it and that's enough for me. Overall I found it very enjoyable and entertaining, a fantastic entry for the franchise, despite all the hate.",Hellboy
274,jadediamond,This movie watched me,3,19 April 2019,"I gave this movie a chance and I was bored out of my mind. I didn't even bother to wait to watch the last thirty minutes. I kept checking the time and was disappointed when I saw I still had an hour left in this movie. I think the movie lost me in the opening scene listening to Ian McShane's voice narrating the intro using unnecessary profanity in the first minute of the movie. This movie was rated R simply to drop f bombs and more gory violent scene. It totally forgot to tell a good story. In the 2004 Hellboy movie starring Ron Perlman, director Guillermo del Toro told the beautiful story about a demonic creature who fought demonic creatures, but despite his origins, he was still brought up by his adopted father Professor Broom (played by the late great John Hurt) and chose to be a good man. Unlike this 2019 Hellboy's unoriginal opening scene taking place in Camelot with King Arthur (yes another King Arthur movie), the opening scene of 2004 Hellboy was cliché taking place in World War II but also beautiful in how a young Professor Broom saw Hellboy as a demon child for the first time and decided to raise him as his son. When Professor Broom dies in the original movie, it forced Hellboy to mature and become a man and eventually win over the woman he loved.
Yet, in this movie, Hellboy is a grown man but acts like a rebellious teenager the whole movie having a love hate relationship with his dismissive father played by Ian McShane. It lacks the beauty of the father and son relationship of the 2004 Hellboy. Milla Jovovich was miscast as the villain, The Blood Queen, or her storyline and reason for wanting to destroy the world was plain stupid. Angelina Jolie, Charlize Theron, or Eva Green would have probably been better choices. I think she wanted revenge but the people who betrayed her were long dead so I don't know. The character of Alice played by American actor Sasha Bianca Lane was a pretty good comedy relief and a nice complement to Hellboy played by David Harbour. Harbour wasn't bad as Hellboy. He just was unfortunately given a bad script and along with McShane and the others had to do the best with the material they were given. This movie is beautiful to look at, but it lacked the substance of the original 2004 movie.
People were sold on this movie being Rated R and the cool poster of the new look of Hellboy. Until that awful trailer showing the movie as a comedy. Hellboy isn't a comedy, but the characters just so happened to be funny or sarcastic to balance out the darkness of the Hellboy series. Even if you didn't like the original Hellboy or thought it didn't live up to the source material, you have to admit the original was a good action fantasy about a man born of darkness, yet raised by goodness and chooses goodness over evil. At the end of the day, Hellboy is a morality tale, but this Hellboy was just plain boring full of gore, violence, and profanity played to rock music. Instead of trying to reboot the franchise, they should have just used Harbour to complete Toro's Hellboy trilogy and then start his own instead of this boring mess. The original I enjoyed from beginning to end. This movie I don't know what the generic hell I just watched. It lost me in the opening scene. I zoned out the first hour with profanity, fighting scenes to rock music, and a boring villain. I checked my watch by the second hour to see I had an hour left. Boring dialogue, more father and son arguing scenes, and more fight scenes to rock music. Then I gave up. In the original movie, I cared about Hellboy, Liz, and John, and was mystified by the Oscar worthy opening scene set in World War II, was saddened by the loss of Professor Broom. I still watch that scene hoping Hellboy would have stopped spying on Liz on her date with John and been there in the nick of time to save his dad. I remembered the ending and the voiceover by John finally seeing Hellboy or Red as Liz affectionately called him as more than a demonic creature from hell. In this movie, I felt none of that or cared about the characters with the exception of Alice a tiny bit. While 2004 Hellboy was an artistic dark masterpiece, this movie felt more like a B movie that should have been a direct to DVD movie or on a feature on the Sci-fy channel.",Hellboy
275,heno-45762,GOOD ACTION Fantasy flick,7,5 July 2019,"I really am disappointed that this movie was doomed before it came out!! THE FACT is no one wanted to like it or give this film a chance that it deserves and recked the movie from making a sequel.This movie should of been MA+15 not R+18 rated like it was.Which probably made it difficult to earn money in the Australian cinemas.
1.Acting is good and solid
2.Slow start but by half way I was right into the story line
3.Dont think of the original and compare
4.CGI could of been better but still good
5.The humour is more towards 15 year olds
6.The storyline was interesting
7.Action sequences are great
8.The gore and evil characters are great
9.Costumes make up and landscape is great

276,piggulu,Didn't have the charm,7,16 April 2019,"Felt like it traded too much for style over substance. I certainly welcomed the R-rating, which it embraces in spades with over-the-top gore and hard action, but the story was lackluster. It seems like they wanted to appeal too much to the hardcore fans or that you needed a certain familiarity with the comics (which I don't). Scenes and characters are just thrown out there without growing into them so they don't have much weight. And Nimue was neither a convincing nor interesting enough villain despite the hype of the destruction she would bring. All this leads up to an unsatisfying conclusion just when the brown stuff appears to hit the fan.Though I haven't read the original comics, consensus says this is a more faithful adaptation. But what I like about the previous movies was the whimsy. This one has a more serious tone, which makes the injected humor feel forced and awkward. Needless to say, I didn't find it completely funny most of the time.Overall, though, it's not necessarily bad but didn't live up to its potential.",Hellboy
277,kevxzara,Hell is just what this is,2,5 July 2019,This film is just bad and doesn't deserve a review,Hellboy
278,DJKwa,"While David Harbour proves himself a suitable successor to don the red paint and horns, the film around him is a hell of a mess.",5,12 April 2019,"Oh boy.In 2016, things seemed to be looking up for Hellboy. Ron Perlman confirmed that he was actively working on making the third instalment of Guillermo del Toro's demon superhero saga a reality. Then everything fell apart. Now to add insult to injury, we have a reboot simply named Hellboy. And it's a mess.Despite the lack of a number or subtitle, those looking for a back-to-basics origin story for Hellboy are fishing for disappointment. The reboot quickly brushes over crucial plot details with expository heavy flashbacks and character backstories are filled in retrospectively, meaning there's little to no context when a new character pops up on screen. To put it bluntly, the story is confusing, muddled and largely hard to follow.To match, the acting from most of the main cast is strained and unconvincing. Sure, they're not helped by a one-dimensional screenplay, but their wooden performances make the human characters feel more unnatural than many of the ungodly creatures that populate the screen. Only David Harbour manages to impress as the titular boy from Hell with his gruff persona and roguish charm. While no Ron Perlman, Harbour proves himself a suitable successor to don the red paint and horns.On the more positive side, there is fun to be had with the film if you can dim the lights in your brain as soon as the theatre goes dark. This is mostly due to its success in capturing the breathless feeling of a comic book as it moves from one set piece to another, not stopping to let you think too hard about what you've witnessed. Along with a rock infused soundtrack, the action scenes prove largely effective in getting the adrenaline pumping as monster entrails are blasted across the screen.All of this, however, is undercut by a non-stop barrage of infantile jokes and cringeworthy one liners that seem to have been focus grouped by a bunch of teenagers. Except they're not the ones who will be viewing the film as its been slapped with an R18+ rating in Australia.

Neil Marshall. Said it. His fixation on gore for the sake of gore, cusswords for the sake of cusswords, gross out moments for the sake of gross out moments, is what has killed every movie he has ever made. Even the few episodes of Game of Thrones he directed has his ""trademark"" b-movie fixation on gore. Why?! Why did anyone think he would be a great match for Hellboy is beyond me.

284,mikedegroot,People here do not know how to review a movie,7,10 July 2019,"First off, I need to be nice here so consider anything in quotes to mean the opposite. So, to all the ""smart people"" here whining that this isn't the movie that they wanted, or that Ron was so much better, or that they don't like the mature tone, or that the other movies were better, and rating this movie a 1, are just ""brilliant"" and are not actually reviewing the movie at all. You have obviously never seen a really bad movie and do not understand what one looks like.Here's what a real review looks like. The story itself is what you would expect from a retelling of an origin story, but feels rushed at times. I would have like to have seen more meaningful action and had some scenes cut and replaced with extended scenes of the more main story. The main story overall is good though. The dialogue does leave something to be desired, but is really not all bad. A few cringeworthy jokes mixed with a handful of truly funny moments.While I do miss Ron as Hellboy, David Harbour does a very serviceable job in the role. Honestly, after the first 20 minutes, he becomes the new Hellboy in my eyes. The rest of the character's acting are all above average but I wish that they would have cast a different actor for Alice. The effects are nicely done but there is a disparity between the practical and digital effects. The practical effects are amazing, while the cgi is still above average.See, that's how you write a review. Simple, huh? You're welcome to disagree with me on these points, but rating this film a 1 is ridiculous. 'I paid money to watch this movie and it didn't quite live up to my expectations so I'm rating it a 1' isn't a review, it's just whining from a ""mentally capable person"" with their head in ""the clouds"" whose never seen an honestly bad movie in their life.",Hellboy

Poorly paced and just pieced together. It was unfunny but they tried too hard to be funny. A dumb ending as well. It's saving grace was it was rated R and violent.,Hellboy
288,stiv-7,Not terrible; just decidedly mediocre,6,29 July 2019,"I tried to go into this with an open mind, having loved del Toro's two films and being disappointed that he and Perlman wouldn't be able to complete their trilogy. I like David Harbour, I'll watch Ian McShane in nearly anything, and I like Daniel Dae Kim. I was also a fan of Dog Soldiers, so I knew Neil Marshall could bring the horror goods.What we wind up with is a mixed bag, on which I'm only slightly positive. It doesn't destroy what del Toro put together (how could it?), but in its efforts to be faithful to the comics, it gets hamstrung. First, the positives: Dae Kim really embodies Ben Daimio and gives the character a depth beyond what he's given in the script. He's easily the best part of the movie. Milla Jovovich is fine as Nimue. Ian McShane's Professor Broom is truer to the comics than John Hurt's and stands a close second to Daimio. David Harbour creates his own Hellboy, but it can't help but pale in comparison to Perlman's.The negatives? The CG. Oh, the CG. Hellboy needs the organic shift between CG and practical effects employed in films as diverse as Jurassic Park and, well, pretty much every del Toro film. The next negative is the script. I imagine the shooting script read like a comic book, because that's what we get here. When comic book films work, it's because they build on the book, not slavishly copy it. The comic is a launching point. Del Toro and other filmmakers who successfully adapt comics understand this; the screenwriters here (and there are at least three uncredited writers on this) don't get it.This I will say: it's not boring, but it's jam-packed with so much exposition, as if to say, ""Here's everything del Toro missed,"" which really adds nothing. In an effort to be ""true to the comic,"" the makers forgot that you need to make a film that is compelling. This ain't it, sadly.",Hellboy

Forget Ron Perlman (I know it hurts but bear with me)Make some pop corn, or get any other preferred snacks on hand.Switch your brains off. No, no deep thinking.Sit back, relax and enjoy the movie, like you'd read a comic book.David Harbour does an excellent job playing Hellboy. He gives the character the new kind of depth which greatly differs from Perlman's work, BUT as I suggested earlier, forget Perlman - and watch as Harbour breathes life to new Hellboy.Other good things in this film; acting, puns (which, thank Gods, are dry as heck, but still fresher than your standard Hollywood jokes), nicely done characters - extending to the monsters - and music.What could've been better? CGI, definitely. And sound mixing - I mean, come on, you got the main battle going, and mixer isn't going all out with the bass and boom?So.

298,someokiedude,*sigh* Just Read The Comics....,3,16 October 2020,"Adaptations tend to be a tricky thing, especially in our new age of comic book adaptations, and as such some changes are to be made. Comic book fans can be a prickly bunch if provoked, luckily we've been blessed with adaptations that have, at best, reinvented characters that we love for a new age and at worst, completely miss the point of the characters that we love (lookin' at you, Zack Snyder).I'm not a huge Hellboy fan, and I didn't start reading the comics until more recently, and I was quite impressed with the series. Mike Mignola is a writer and artist who somehow manages to be gifted at both, creating a world that manages to be alien, strange, and unusual while also having a down to earth approach that makes the series even more unique. Sadly, I didn't find any of the evocative charm that I saw in the comics with this film. It's quite unfortunate that this film falls so flat on its face, considering that David Harbour is a rather inspired choice for the titular hero, considering his character on Stranger Things is basically if Hellboy was a small town sheriff, and director Neil Marshall was also a good choice in order to bring more life to Mignola's world, considering that he's been well established as a cult action/horror director with films like The Descent and Dog Soldiers under his belt. Yet, as the old story goes, the studios got into this mess and somehow managed to muck everything up.The film tries to be many things at once, it tries to be a Sam Raimi movie, yet without his careful balance between zany slapstick and creepy visuals and atmosphere, it tries to be a superhero film, yet without the verve of the Russos, Whedon, and Waititi, and it tries to bring Mignola's original material to the screen, yet without the tone and atmosphere that made the original comic so intriguing. I've heard this film be compared to Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil films and to be fair, it feels like the film was directed by Paul W.S Anderson at times, its mindless fun and utter lack of tone reeks of his filmography, which brings me to what I think the main problem with this film is: its utter lack of tone. The film oscillates between fun comic book-y action and extremely disturbing body horror and graphic violence, because that's what Hellboy needs and then throw in some bad to mediocre CGI and you got yourselves a bad, bad film.It's not entirely awful though, much like how no film is perfect, no film is an unsalvageable wreck (maybe except for Sucker Punch). David Harbour, as I mentioned previously, is a neat fit for the big red lug that is Hellboy, though much like Perlman, his version of Hellboy has a penchant of being whiny, though nonetheless he has some good lines and wisecracks that are littered through the film. Ian McShane tries to do a good job playing Bruttenholm (pronounced Broom), though the writers make him into another version of Al Swearengen, though unlike Swearengen, this version of Bruttenholm isn't well written, complex, or even funny asides from some unintentionally hilarious moments. The practical effects, when used, are utilized quite well, especially with the Baba Yaga, and it made me wish that they were used more, but I'll take what I can get. The action sequences are also well done for the most part, especially the stuff with Lobster Johnson (also great casting choice with Thomas Haden Church), and Daniel Dae Kim was actually not bad in his role, though his character is rather flat.I'd like to think that I'm not a prickly comics fan who likes his comic adaptations to be the exact same as the source material, but its films like these that makes me act like one. To save you the trouble, I'd recommend to just skip this film and read the comics, as they're much more intriguing and better written than the film that we got.",Hellboy

307,michaeljpfitzgerald,"Holy cow, what a stinker.",1,16 December 2019,"It's pretty dazzling how bad this movie is. It's rare to see such an invested combination of bad writing and absentee directing, especially when there's such a rich subject to draw from - if you told me Neil Marshall hated Hellboy, and Mike Mignola, and this was some sort of money-laundering revenge scheme, it would be more believable than 'he tried to make a good movie', and considerably preferable.McShane is the only one who seems to know, shot to shot, that he's in a pile of garbage; it's probably not to his credit that he's never been able to fake interest in a bad project, but there are times I really appreciate it. And here, both of us viewing this mess from opposite ends, is one of those times.I like David Harbour so much, it was particularly sad to see him in this - not a line worth saying, and swaddled in so much make-up he couldn't make a face, there was no way for him to rise above the surrounding schlock.

310,WhatcanyaDo,Not as Bad as Everybody Says,6,12 July 2019,"I'd like to start by saying I'm a big Hellboy fan. That being said, if given the choice, I would have have preferred to have seen an R rated Del Toro Hellboy 3. That wasn't in the cards, however, and we got this version. Having no choice in the matter, I was just glad to get another Hellboy flick. I rate it at 6. I give Del Toro's movies an 8.I didn't expect to like this movie given the terrible reviews, but I found my self enjoying it. Don't get me wrong, the movie didn't quite hit on all cylinders and it could have been much better, but it was action packed and the cgi was pretty slick. It maintained a steady pace and held my attention until after the credits rolled by.The dialog at times was pretty bad, and I didn't care for Milla Jovovich as the main villan at all; she was emotionless and one dimensional. David Harbour was a convincing, if moody, Hellboy, but he's no Ron Perlman. Hellboy as a character wasn't portrayed as much of a bad ass as he should have been and took too many beatings. The rest of the cast was just adequate, the script just didn't provide them enough depth to be fleshed out.If you're looking for a mindless action movie to kill an evening, this would be a decent pick. If you're looking for a Hellboy 3, prepare for disappointment. In fact, truthfully, if there wasn't a previous Hellboy and Hellboy 2, people would probably like this movie a little bit more.",Hellboy

David Harbour I cannot understand how you mess this roll up so bad with the teenage angst type of attitude and then screaming every line at the top of your lungs.

312,TYContact1,I like game/ comic adaptations but this one - it's both too long and too short,4,13 April 2019,"I'm not comparing this reboot franchise with Del Toro's 2004-2008 version - it was a different era (before we got spoiled by Marvel's scripts and CGs). But Neil Marshall, the director of The Descent and Dog Soldiers, should have done better with the reboot.The movie is too long: needless gory, profane scenes to justify the ""R"" rating, minus Deadpool's humour (ok, it's Marvel budget - it's unfair comparison). I don't mind intense fight scenes: John Wick, or gory scenes: the Aliens. But where is the build up?
The movie is too short: too many characters and plots to introduce to set up the franchise / universe. Exhibit A: Fantastic Beasts and Where to find them part I.
Editing and dialogues swept the audience away - not in a good way.I'm not being picky - reference: I like the Resident Evil movies. That franchise went well for the first few instalments (6.5), then went downwards to 5.5 near the end.

Left out the whole part about giving his eye at the end. The credits scene was completely pointless and stupid. And any action movie wants a big finish. This laid flat. So anti climatic. Some things just need to be left well alone.,Hellboy
315,HorrorFan6969,I try but it's really that bad... how to destroy great films of Guillermo Del Toro,1,13 April 2019,"Bloody, and bloody ludicrous, Hellboy boasts plenty of attitude and gore, all in a desperate attempt to seem edgier than the previous big-screen iteration of this demon-spawn antihero. Consciously moving away from the B-movie pleasures that director Guillermo del Toro brought to the franchise more than a decade ago, this remake of the Dark Horse property is a unrelentingly 15-rated action-horror film ('R' in the US), casting Stranger Things star David Harbour as the titular enforcer, who is noticeably more hardboiled, sarcastic and anguished this time around. But between the overblown poor CG, witless dialogue and pervasive, numbing violence, the new Hellboy deserves its own special circle in Dante's Inferno.This kinda-remake will test how well moviegoers remember the cult comic-book character. Hellboy doesn't sport many big names, but the hard-15 content should help distinguish it from the more family-friendly and excellent movie: Shazam! Still, the film is merely marking time before Avengers: Endgame demolishes all in its path.Harbour plays Hellboy, a half-demon who works alongside human beings as a paranormal investigator, hunting down evil monsters. Although he loves Professor Broom (Ian McShane), the human who adopted him as a boy, he finds himself questioning his place when he squares off with the Blood Queen (Milla Jovovich), a powerful witch who believes their destinies are linked - and that he should assist her in destroying humanity.Director Neil Marshall (The Descent, episodes of Game Of Thrones) has crafted a superhero movie that is profoundly unsuitable for children. Not only is copious blood shed, heads are torn from bodies, helpless bystanders are ripped in half, and you never know when a character will be impaled or stabbed through the eye. Clearly, this remake wants to establish itself as a grisly, grownup fantasy film, but Marshall and screenwriter Andrew Crosby miss the mark on exactly how best to achieve that down-and-dirty tone. As a result, Hellboy postures obnoxiously, parading its strained splatter-house aesthetic as proof of its impertinence.Taking the reins from Ron Perlman, who played Hellboy in the del Toro films as a gentle, sulking giant, Harbour overdoes the character's seen-it-all-before gruffness. Nearly all of Hellboy's lines involve either a wan quip or an expositional update on his tortured internal journey to find a place where he belongs. By trying so hard to sell the audience on how surly Hellboy is, Harbour drains this antihero of spark or wit. Oscar-winning makeup designer Joel Harlow does superb work transforming the actor into the hulking, buff, burnt-red creature, however.Elsewhere, Hellboy is an unfortunate mixture of cheap histrionics - lots of handwringing about character destinies and convoluted backstories - and superhero-movie conventionality. Long before the de rigueur ending tease of future instalments that will, conceivably, feature other characters from the Hellboy comics, this remake struggles to balance Arthurian legend, father-son drama, nonsensical plotting, gross-out scares and increasingly unwieldy action sequences, complete with overly complicated digital trickery and a clattering hard-rock soundtrack. There's a lot going on in Hellboy as the film dutifully shuffles from set piece to set piece while frantically trying to world-build on the fly.The supporting cast doesn't do much to help. Sasha Lane shows spirit as Hellboy's friend Alice, who has psychic abilities, but the American Honey discovery is stuck in a thin role. Jovovich struts around in style, understandably rejecting any semblance of subtlety while playing a character called the Blood Queen. As for McShane, the Deadwood star goes on prickly-father-figure autopilot, adding some grit to pointless confrontation scenes between the professor and his demon son.When del Toro made 2004's Hellboy (and the sequel four years later), he made an emotional investment in the material's exploration of outsiders looking for a home - a familiar trope in his work. And even though he was confined by the films' PG-!2 (US-13) rating, the director nonetheless managed to conceive magical realms and smart, fun action scenes. By comparison, Marshall simply slathers on more and more gratuitous violence, finding little poetry or inspiration in the bloodletting. ""The monster inside him cannot be denied,"" someone says of the rampaging Hellboy at one point. Pity no one considered that there might be a compelling soul in there, too.",Hellboy

317,CinematicGarbage,Unneccessary! (4.9/10),2,14 May 2019,"Okay, we had two Hellboy movies directed by Guillermo del Toro, one from 2004 and the Golden Army in 2008 starring Ron Perlman as Hellboy. Unfortunately, I didn't watch the whole two films, but some clips because I didn't have much time. The two movies were praised by critics a lot and the first one was rated 81%, the sequel was rated 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. And then, in 2019, Neil Marshall decided to have this reboot of Hellboy. They wanted to prove that Hellboy should be more modern with good effects and cinematography. But they had also gone too far.Starring David Harbour was Hellboy, in this reboot, Hellboy had to battle so many monsters. Monsters here and there. There was so much action, these people wanted to make better cinematography so audiences would think that these battles are epic and unforgettable. The performances, I think they're okay but sometimes they sucked. Harbour's performance was really good, he's funny. He made most parts of the movie looked like a joke and kinda like a parody (because the cinematography's better).I like the humor they added here. I did laugh, especially the elevator scene (up down up down). But Harbour wasn't as good as Perlman's. Then I like the make-up of Hellboy here more than the two previous films. Hellboy was more good-looking here (with long hair and small eyes). Those're the things I only liked about this reboot.The special effects were really bad. They created monsters filmmakers could do in the 80s like the Gruagach or when Ben Daimio turned into a jaguar. They could've used an animal and add some extra parts. They could've done better in here. The editing was really not cool. This was like a few terrible movies wanted to have good cinematography but had bad CGI like Fant4stick (Congratulations Fant4stick on going way too far and got in the Razzies!). The cinematography was really awesome and if you watch this in IMAX, you would be entertained a lot. I watched the trailer in IMAX thanks to IMDb. I liked the lightning and the sky.The fact that this movie was rated R was a BIG mistake. They did drop some F-Bombs everywhere, even when it's unneccessary to say the F word in a few lines. They also had some ""Strong and Bloody Violence"" (I could see these words in the trailer) like in ""Deadpool"" or ""Logan"", but they were needless. There were also people being ripped in half, people being stabbed bloodily by the giant monsters. Are they trying to prevent this movie from children? Huh? What? The movie proved that not all R-Rated movies're for adults and 18-year-olds. I'm younger than that and I could watch it with ease. I'm not afraid of anything. Are they trying to copy Sam Raimi's horror movies?I really didn't know why this movie was based on the legend of King Arthur and the Excalibur sword. It was not suitable. If it is, I should've read the comics. I really didn't like the idea. They turned this whole action thingy into a fantasy like in ""The Kid who Would Be King"" was released earlier this year and I kinda liked it. Another problem was that they set too many characters in here. Too many actions scene from lots of characters fighting and they also moved from places to places (just like nomads).This reboot was unneccessary to make. It was soulless but enjoyable. This was one of the movies that were really bad with black bars, good cinematography and sometimes bad CGI like ""Fant4stick"" or ""Suicide Squad"". If you find this Hellboy reboot entertaining, then I suggest you to waste 2 hours to watch it.",Hellboy

Not to mention, I went in to it with fresh memories of the previous Hellboy movies and I was also a bit distracted. Then, I considered that I don't actually know the comic storyline (to this day) and decided to give it second try. I was not disappointed. Though the CGI monsters looked like exactly that, this movie is definitely at least an 7 for a coherent plot (many reviewers say there isn't, but I believe they may have only watched it once).

Though the character is all about monsters and demons and creatures from darkness and fairytales (things I enjoy), never been a great fan. All the way back to 2004 when the first movie came out, I went first on the comics to learn more about this character and I think Del Toro did quite a good job, in spite of not being as faithful to the comics in the horror and dark atmosphere wich we can clearly see in the comics. At that matter, the 2019 installment does so much better. Darker, grittier, bloodier, more violent and everything. And the movie does very well during the first act and half the second act. Clearly they had a tight budget and saved on CGI. That I could forget, had the movie sticked with a nice plot. But as the movie rolls through the second act, it becomes messy and quality decays. Can't really say why things ended so badly from mid to final act... things aren't properly explained and several characters simply come out of the blue with subplots that supposed to add something but that never happens. Instead, the movie loses its way and what was supposed to be a remarkable reboot ended up being a total disaster.",Hellboy

324,sheldonnylander,Discordant Heavy Metal Compared to Del Toro's Grand Symphony,3,13 November 2019,"If Guillermo del Toro's version of Hellboy is the imaginative grand symphony, this version is the discordant heavy metal little brother. Based on ""The Wild Hunt"" and ""The Storm and the Fury"" storylines in the comics doesn't save it, either.Lacking the Del Toro's vision, the character and monster designs are pedantic at best. David Harbour plays the titular infernal hero and while at first the costume design seems grittier than Ron Perlman's Hellboy, it becomes clear very quickly that, while Perlman became the character and almost seemed to meld with his costume, Harbour seems to be fighting his costume. It's like watching one of the most uncomfortable and anxiety-ridden wrestling matches one can imagine. I kind of felt sorry for Harbour as he's a good actor with the right material, but he got handed such terrible material to work with. To his credit, it's clear that he does try to sell it, but when you're selling crap, it's still crap.The characters come off more as caricatures. Their relationships are so basic and one-dimensional even if they exist that we find that we don't really care. And that's the major problem. The stakes aren't built up enough to make us care. It's a good versus evil comic-book film and we don't really care whether the good guys live or if the bad guys win. Making the audience care and identify with the characters should be the bread and butter of ""Hellboy."" Instead, we're given a cracker and told to run along and play.Don't bother unless you are a major fan of the comics or the actors and simply HAVE to see it. Even then, you might want to consider steering clear as it could taint your love for these.",Hellboy
325,burkholdermicah,"If you're a Long-Time Fan of Hellboy, you Should go see this Movie!",10,13 April 2019,"I'm gonna say it right now: This Movie is REALLY Accurate to the Spirit of the Comics. Even though this Movie LOOKS Bad, I'm getting really Tired of all the negative reviews and low Rotten Tomatoes Scores. Did I see a completely different Movie? Yes, I guess you could say that judging from my Review and everyone else's Review.
This Review is gonna be from a HUGE Long-time Hellboy Fan who knows and cares about the Character. Now albeit that Del Toro's Version was more funner in terms of Character Design and Hellboy in that Movie looked more Handsomer in that Movie. Now, the Hellboy in this Movie looks kinda off mostly because he's supposed to be a literal Demon from Hell and they took that turn a bit TOO Seriously. This might be the reason why this Movie is turning everyone off for some reason. Also, this Movie was such a Fun Bloody Good Time from Start to Finish.
The Story that the Movie is based on is still to this day one of my Favorite Hellboy Stories And It truly shows the true nature and full strength of the Character. The Character Himself is supposed to be this sorta funny Character that has a few one-liners. And in this Movie, he's taken very literally and the Actor himself said he had a fun time playing as this Character. And YES, I know that you all want the Old Actor Back because he's MEANT to be Hellboy. But, that doesn't mean you can't give other actors a chance to play this Character and the hate around this new actor is just so annoying.
The other thing that I love mostly about this film is the Monsters and the Bloody Violence. Now, I'm mostly one for seeing a lot of Blood in Movies and I don't mind if it takes an Edgy approach. ONLY, if it's done right though, and this Movie is havin' Blood Splatter all over the place and it feels like I'm watching an Anime at times. And I'm also satisfied with the brutal glory kills that Hellboy delivers to everyone who is his enemy. That final act in particular was so fun and satisfying seeing Hellboy show off his full engaging Strength and why he's so powerful.
In the end, as a LONG-Time Hellboy Fan, this Movie was great and it was fun and entertaining. There are multiple scenes in this Movie where it is well-designed and well-directed. But don't expect any Oscar-Winning Writing nor Oscar-Winning Voice Acting. Go out and see this Movie, if you Love Hellboy and if you think he's one of the best Characters ever Created!
I'm gonna give two Verdicts for this Movie: both as a Hellboy Fan and as a Movie Fan.Verdict (from a Hellboy Fan's Perspective): 8/10!Verdict (from a Movie Fan's Perspective): 7/10!",Hellboy
326,jetskiboybze,Original wasn't great this is much worse,2,20 July 2019,"I wasnt overly impressed by the original but it had a reasonable hellboy and wasnt too over the top. This one despite having a Hellboy who had more character, was totally over the top. It couldnt decide if it wanted to be serious or a comedy and achieved neither with any success. It will appeal to those who like excessive amounts of blood and gore but only those. The minotaur character was midly amusing and there was nothing wrong with the acting of the cast (slightly surprised Ian McShane lowered himself to this level) but really they had nothing to work with. In general a ridiculous film that I didnt bother watching till the end. Again whilst not great, stick with the original made earlier with less stupid cgi but much more believability. Seriously disappointing.",Hellboy
327,peternaulls,Mindless nonsensical trash,3,29 March 2020,"This sits with Batman and Robin as being one of the worst superhero/antihero movies made.
The CGI is poor in places. The plot is weak and makes no sense, the dialogue was so cheesy. The actor playing Hellboy shouts constantly. Why though? The Cheetah dude' British accent was awful.The only parts I thougt were okay were the monster designs a d movement of the giants and and baba yaga and there was a decent use of a Muse song in the giants fight scenes.Sadly and overall there are not really any redeeming features. Stick to the del Toro movies which are more fun have better storylines characters that you might care about.",Hellboy

331,adamw332,A disaster,4,11 July 2019,"The hellboys movies had given this new film a strong base to continue from, but they still managed to screw this one up royally. Bad acting, bad story, and yes even bad CGI, (aren't special effects supposed to be getting constantly getting better?).",Hellboy
332,Critiquethecritics,Not horrible. Not bad. Not ungood. Not good. VERY GOOD!!,7,12 January 2020,Not horrible. Not great. Del Torros conceptuals and visuals are hard to compete with. Ron Perlman is a master of physical acting and comedic and dramatic delivery. David Harbour gives a valiant attempt to channel both Hellboy and Ron Perlmans interpretation. Can't really imagine anyone else taking over... someone pissed the critics off here. Amazing CGI. Solid 7-8 all day long.,Hellboy
333,DexX,"Great cast, pity about literally everything else",2,24 January 2020,"This film reeks of studio interference. The script is muddled and aimless, spending far too long on irrelevant scenes and skipping lightly over important plot. The effects are terrible, which wouldn't be so bad if there weren't so many of them, but half the shots in the film feature poorly-lit digital creatures and unconvincing compositing. The direction, editing, and cinematography are completely bland, showing absolutely no style or flair. What a criminal waste of a truly excellent cast. David Harbour is a brilliant actor, but he just isn't given the material to work with. Awful film. Just awful.",Hellboy
334,Darkskynet,A disappointing mess,5,15 April 2019,"The opening sequence really does lay-out what to expect in the film. It is incredibly over the top, stuffed with story and topped off with some cringe-worthy acting.
The entire film is so busy with various story plot elements which are either mentioned off-the-cuff or not explored in deeper detail that the film felt as if it needed a prequel to explain everything. Acting, in particular from actress Sasha Lane who plays Alice was very hammy and not believable - it felt as though I was watching a school theatre production. Similarly, Milla Jovovich who plays Nimue had a very deflating presence on screen, one which did not represent her strong character.
David Harbour who plays Hellboy, however, was well casted. His IDGAF attitude came across without feeling forced. His appearance despite the wooden lip movements looked realistic. Finally, the script felt outdated with cliche one liners and predictable moments.Generally, a disappointing re-make, one which I recommend others waiting until it's released on TV to watch.",Hellboy
335,Kumarh02,It's darker than the original,8,16 April 2019,"I actually enjoyed this more than the original. Some of the characters are scarier (baba yaga especially worthy of any horror movie) and it definitely merits its 15/R rating. Rarely said, but the film is far better than the trailer- I went in with low expectations. Harbour carries the role in his stride and I quite liked Graham's voice over - even b-movie Jovovich adds a positive energy. Overall, the movie is to be enjoyed if you give it a chance.PS - There are two credit scenes",Hellboy

There were some interesting visuals and funny lines but it does not distract from how disappointing this effort was. The story was all over the place and ridiculous, the camera work was operated by someone on a pogo stick and it felt like the whole film was on speed. Poor.",Hellboy
338,technusgirl,"Give it a chance, you'll be impressed!",7,14 April 2019,"I'm guessing this movie got such a low score from people who can't get over someone else playing Hell Boy, but David Harbour actually did a top notch job in this. The makeup was also fantastic and I love the new, rougher around the edges and more demonic style look to Hell Boy. The weird giant monsters were one of the best parts, but I feel like there should have been more time dedicated to this.I would have given a higher score but I didn't really like the blood and gore so much, and there was a lot of it towards the end. Also, some of the graphics were a bit unconvincing at times. I also think they could have reduced the overall time to an hour and a half because it was a bit slow in the beginning.We also got to know Hell Boy's origin which was interesting. I came into this thinking it was a sequel but it was really a prequel. But, overall the acting was superb and the monsters and creatures were creepy as hell, pardon the pun. I think this movie really deserves a chance.",Hellboy

It's unbelievable how director Neill Marshall could have been so incompetent as to manage messing up a previously awesome franchise!Instead of the fun and ironic fantasy ride of the past films, this one is just violent gory dumbness...The Hellboy character is now an ugly creep and talks and behaves like some Texas hillbilly redneck, the music around any action scene is annoyingly bad hard rock, and the plot is just plain boring and stupid, with unnecessary excessive violence all the time.Two stars for special effects, but unfortunately this new version of Hellboy is irritating and unwatchable garbage..",Hellboy
341,NotoriousMayhem,Absolute Garbage. Hellboy? More like Hellsnore,1,11 April 2019,Worst movie of the year so far. Everything was terrible.

Not perfect but a good first iteration of a ""darker"" universe; much like the comic book. Plenty action and ""bro talk"". The biggest mistake will be trying to compare Bellboy 2.0 to the 15 year old movie version. Times have changed. A lot! Get with it and give this a go. Ps. Even the 2004 film only managed a 6.9 rating proving no matter the direction there are a fair number of libtards that don't actually know what they want.",Hellboy
344,benj-20839,Hellboy is Really Good. If you liked Venom or Evil Dead 3 Army Of Darkness then this is for you.,8,17 April 2019,"What you'd expect from a Hellboy movie written by the creator of the character and its world, A really good Hellboy movie, a cool and funny Hellboy, great action and mayhem, and a hero trying to understand his place in this human world.Its pacey and fun, equally as good as the Del Toro Hellboy movies. Maybe slightly better for some especially considering the screenplay was by the Hellboy creator himself!I would highly recommend this if you like your superhero movies pacey, fun, interesting and R-rated. Can be blood-gory in a few places just so you know.This is a good mix of the Del Toro Hellboy's, Silent Hill and Resident Evl movies.For a lower budget than the previous Hellboys there's a lot of action and impressive CGI and practical effects in it. They really squeezed every ounce of that budget for our viewing pleasure.The soundtrack and song choices are really cool and work perfectly with the scenes and action sequences.I've read a couple of critics reviews saying that think there's too much exposition, that's totally not true, there are a few to give you a brief backstory to some characters, which works well and at brief amount of time, 1-2 minutes each, so for a 2 hour movie does that seem like a LOT of exposition to you??! It's not noticeable in the whole scheme of things but very welcomed and a nice touch. The introduction to Hellboy is the longest of the few, obviously, which is about 2-3 minutes long, and its really cool as it adds a new ass-kicking character that the Del Toro version didn't have, who is badass and from the Hellboy Universe not previously seen before in the movies.This is a great addition to the Hellboy movies and will definitely become a cult classic. I just wish it did well at the boxoffice so we could get a sequel. But unfortunately critics have a lot to answer for with this innocent film..maybe they just really want you to go and watch Shazam lol...for some reason!!!??
Critics have ruined another films boxoffice potential!This is better than Captain Marvel and the child audience focused film Shazam.And David Harbour is excellent as Hellboy, equal to Ron Pearlman's.",Hellboy
345,harrylt,Don't make Jim hopper angry you won't like him when he's angry,6,23 July 2019,"All I could think when watching most of David Harbours part was, he's playing a big red Jim hopper from STRANGER THINGS. Don't get me wrong, I think it worked well. The rest of the film wasn't that great which was a shame because there was so much potential. There were parts that didn't quite make sense and had alot of plot holes plus the script was nothing special. I also got the impression there was a fair proportion of the film were the creators just assumed all the viewers know the comics well and didn't bother explaining Who, What, When and Why etc.
I would like to think the franchise knew were they went wrong and do right with a decent sequel if there is one.",Hellboy

The script was very poor, everything felt like forced upon and hurried and the CGI was awful for a big movie, the giants were hilarious, the monsters were hilarious, atrocious acting from almost everyone, felt like a spoof but just not funny even.",Hellboy
347,vikramsamal,B grade,3,12 April 2019,Absolutely gutted because HellBoy series have been one of my favourites and Guillermo DelToro took it to different heights with his imagination and this one is an absolute B grade product. Expected so much what they deliver is a cheesy gory product with appaling VFX. And David Harbour looked his part but was let down by shoddy writing.,Hellboy
348,oldgirl,soooo much gore,5,3 August 2019,"I'm normally not strictly against gore -- loved the opening scene of Lake Placid where the guy is bitten in half -- love the blood splashing artistically in Conan the Barbarian -- love the ludicrous social commentary and accompanying blood-letting in RoboCop. However, this has soooo much gore -- like Event Horizon, it's egregious and unnecessary. The one kudo I can give is the nice little plot twist in re Hellboy's origins. And I like the Alice character, as well as the addition of a very unpleasant Baba Yaga. This may be a version closer to the original Dark Horse comics, but I miss Del Toro's chill touch and the solid empathy of Perlman's Hellboy. The new Hellboy still seems familiar enough, but the plot path of the film was soaked in crimson, obscuring what otherwise would have been a good story.",Hellboy
349,joshteggert,There's a special place reserved in hell for this demonic abomination of a reboot.,2,12 August 2019,"In the 11 years that have passed since Hellboy II: The Golden Army, a lot has changed in the world of comic book films. Superhero powerhouse Marvel Studios have released 21 films from its extensive repertoire, with the biggest and most ambitious comic book movie to date - Avengers: Endgame - just around the corner. Likewise, there's a far greater platform for more 'adult' superhero films too (e.g. Deadpool and Logan). But being 'more adult' does not necessarily mean 'more mature', as this reboot - now boasting a 15 rating for strong violence, gore and language - is a categorically dumbfounding monstrosity.Hellboy tells the tale of the titular Cambion, this time portrayed by David Harbour (Stranger Things), who works for the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (B.P.R.D) under the guidance of Ian McShane (American Gods) as his adopted father Trevor Bruttenholm. Hellboy is needed more than ever when 5th century enchantress Nimue, The Fifth Element's Milla Jovovich, returns from the grave seeking to exact her revenge upon the world.There is precious little to praise about Hellboy; Harbour takes the mantle (or the horns, one may say) from the legendary Ron Perlman rather pleasingly, bringing a natural charm to the role that many had anticipated he would.But yeah, that's essentially it. What goes on around him is an unbearable concoction of exaggerated gore, lacklustre CGI, abysmal dialogue and clumsy narrative focus which culminates to form a truly agonising movie experience. Director Neil Marshall takes all the unfavourable and overstated characteristics of modern blockbusters and heaps them into this two-hour mess, throwing everything and the kitchen sink at the audience until it has produced a monster reminiscent of Hellboy himself. The astonishing and downright cringeworthy overuse of the F-bomb in Andrew Cosby's screenplay further makes the film more uncomfortable to sit through (seriously, there are likely more in this than in two whole seasons of Game of Thrones).Yet Mike Mignola, the creator of the original Hellboy comic series, commented that this film translates his original material more faithfully than previous instalments. This may be true in the sense that, like a typical comic book series, the film is driven by several side-plot missions with the overarching narrative of Jovovich's Blood Queen tying it all together. But this just doesn't work for the big screen. Instead what is produced is a clunky structure which gets increasingly frustrating over time; it's near impossible to get a hold of what's going on in Hellboy before something else comes to the immediate forefront.The reliance on CGI takes a heavy toll too. It's been demonstrated that Hellboy can feel authentic in Guillermo del Toro's two frightening yet alluring films back in the 2000s; his filmmaking style seemed the perfect fit for these characters, but losing that natural wonder in favour of this horrid new fabrication leaves an even more bitter taste on the tongue than the film alone. It's a painful viewing experience, not only because it's a dreadful film, but because as you leave the cinema, the heart-breaking reality sets in that del Toro's vision for a Hellboy trilogy will never be realised.There's a special place reserved in hell for this demonic abomination of a reboot. For a summer that is packed with popcorn spectacles and cinematic milestones alike, giving this one a miss wouldn't be unwise.",Hellboy
350,adshiel,Just awful...,1,26 July 2019,Just why?Poor CGI...Nothing to really like about Hellboy in this versionScripting awfulThe English Accents of certain characters made me want to rip out my ear drums...,Hellboy
351,sophaljonesy,A reboot that did not need to happen,6,18 April 2019,"The reason I wanted to watch this was seeing Hellboy with full horns, and Milla Jovovich playing evil. Apart from that, they should have let Guillermo del Toro do Hellboy 3 instead of rebooting it. While David Harbour brought a new interpretation of Hellboy, the story is much less impactful. The only good thing about the movie besides the action is Harbour's acting. The rest of the cast is bland. I am disappointed with Jovovich's villain. She was not menacing or tough at all, though she had the right look for an evil queen. Daniel Dae Kim's British accent was jarring, and Ian McShane's Professor Broom was nowhere as endearing as John Hurt's version. In short, I still prefer Guillermo del Toro's version of Hellboy, the characters are more relatable and you care for all of them: Ron Perlman's Hellboy, Selma Blair's Liz Sherman, and Doug Jones' Abe Sapien. Even the antagonists were interesting. In short, this reboot should not have happened, and even if it was a fun movie, and David Harbour was great, it did not surpass the del Toro version.",Hellboy

359,pm-griffiths-956-445192,Trading visuals for substance,5,2 October 2019,"I don't believe any film ever deserves a 1/10 rating. Given all the effort by so many people, there are always some redeeming qualities. A 1 rating is typically someone ranting rather than being fair because they were disappointed in some way.Me, I rated this a 6 or 7/10 when assessed by itself. It was a reasonably entertaining romp. The downside was trading good story substance and characters for visuals/CGI. Nothing new on the story front - an ancient evil re-emerges and is eventually defeated, etc. And Ian McShane is always fun to watch. But you know it is average fair when you're not going to watch it again.The rating drops to a 4-5 when you compare it to the Hellboy films from Del Toro.

363,zaidmnomani,Truly Inadequate In Every Way,1,5 May 2020,"Hellboy 2019 is the very definition of a sloppy script with terrible special effects brought to life with terrible execution. This movie has one of the most convoluted stories I've ever seen, so much so that the best way to describe it would be thus: Five episodes of a TV show crammed together in the format of a two hour long film, with episodes one and three missing.There were times when I wondered whether this was a sequel to a movie that I had not seen. That would explain how the film expects you to know all the characters, and constantly references to past events. Maybe if you were a hardcore fan of the comics you might understand. But that narrows down the target audience significantly, because I doubt that many people read Hellboy comics. If you were a casual movie goer who simply wished to watch a fun summer blockbuster, then you would understand this film as much as a person who has not seen any marvel movies understand Avengers Endgame.The characters jump from one location to another every five minutes. At times it feels like a stage show. New scene, new location, new characters for a certain amount of time and then it jumps to the next scene. The two side characters are introduced halfway through the film, and are so insignificant at first that you don't realize they're integral to the plot until much later.The villain's backstory is explained in the first five minutes by a terrible expedition dump. It's never a good sign when your story starts with a narrator who explains the plot. The story tries to have elements of King Arthur and the Dark Ages, ancient monsters and giants, and the modern day world. It would have been preferable if it took place in the ancient medieval days, because the modern setting really takes away from the atmosphere and mood.You feel no emotional attachment to any character in the entire film, because there is nothing relatable or likable about them. Hellboy is mostly indifferent to everything that happens. He doesn't seem to care about the plot, which begs the question: Why should we? Hellboy's father is a huge jerk for most of the story as well and for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Even the villan is generic and forgetable.The film jumps from one subplot to another, never giving the watcher time to process anything that's happening. Initially, I thought that it was going to be about a McGuffin subplot, but it completely skips over that and moves on to another McGuffin subplot. See what I mean by the story being needlessly complicated?At least the practical effects are good, but they don't blend well with the CGI at all. The action is pretty entertaining, if you can understand what's going on. And the movie is pretty unique in terms of story. And by unique I mean it's structured in the most bizarre way possible. Watch this movie if you want a headache when it's over.",Hellboy

Even Gremlins has a 2 second feature. It's a feast of badly presented and incoherent fanfare that is only useful for fanboys with no sense of cinematic value.

Lots of cheesy action sequences and pretty ridiculous CGI. Rolled my eyes a few times when Alice attempted to fight hand to hand. Looked slow and sloppy as far as film and execution went during said sequences. Hellboy's hand sits way too low and doesn't have a lot of movement, and the way David Harbour carries this massive paper mache' hand lazily makes me feel like he either didn't bother to make it look authentic, or didn't know how. Ron Perlman did a much better job pulling off the Hellboy look and the hand looked far more authentic and believable. These are clearly minor details that people only care about if they actually look for them though. The story itself was pretty flat, I didn't get too interested in it, and it seemed like by the time the main villain was at full power, she was already putting herself into situations that could easily get her killed. They appear to want to do a sequel, and if that's in the cards still, I hope they make some major improvements, otherwise they need to find something else to cheaply reboot, or just call Ron to come back.",Hellboy
368,garabedbaghsarian,Ruined the beauty of the original movie,4,21 September 2019,"Another 2019 movie that showed up for free from the library. Now, I'm not a huge fan of the original Guillermo Del Toro Hellboy movies, I've only seen the first one, but I really like it. It's action-packed, it has great effects, it has fun characters and it's just a good movie. The 2019 remake is not a good movie. Like, it's not the worst comic book movie ever made, not by a long shot, but it just has an overall feeling of cheapness. Some of the action was okay and I like the design of some of the characters but that's about it as far as good things about this movie go. The story makes no sense, the characters are all boring and unlikeable and the effects are AWFUL!!!!!!! The prosthetics are okay, Hellboy looks fine (Except for the tail. It just hangs there and does nothing.) and I really liked this witch monster that shows up halfway through, but the CGI is some of the worst I've ever seen for a movie this recent. It looks like it's from the early 2000s, not 2019! It reminds me of Van Helsing or Underworld or Resident Evil. Remember those? It's just terrible! It also reminded me of Deadpool with all the violence and one-liners and it rips off the title cards that show the names of locations from the MCU movies. Clearly this movie is not as good as those. There are some good kills with lots of blood and guts in this movie and some wild monsters that show up that are actually kinda cool, but it's all CGI so I have to take points off for that. The music was also kinda distracting. Overall, there's just not much I have to say about this movie. It's bad, but I didn't hate it. If you just want to watch schlock, this isn't a bad choice. I actually think it's a little better than Venom. If you actually want a good movie, however, stick with the Del Toro films.",Hellboy

371,drawnsupreme,An Epic Disaster,3,23 July 2019,"The story and pacing of this movie is a complete disaster. So many scenes dragged, and dragged, making the entire movie extremely boring. The action sequences were boring. The jokes all fell completely flat. Not even a smirk from me! The dialogue was not even remotely close to being better than the original Hellboy films. Who wrote this junk? It's like the director, Neil Marshall, simply didn't care enough to make a good movie here, nor did the writers. Whoever approved of this needs to be fired, pronto!This 2019 Hellboy was a major letdown. David Harbour is a terrible actor and simply doesn't bring the same energy, charisma, and wittiness as Ron Perlman. David just doesn't have it. Ron Perlman's 2004 Hellboy was like watching a page straight out of the comics come directly to life - but this 2019 Hellboy was nothing but a cheap imitation.From the main actor not having the skillset to play Hellboy, to one of Hollywood's most garbage directors, this is just one of those movies that you could easily pass on because it brings nothing new or original to the table.Guillermo Del Toro and Ron Perlman are simply better suited for a movie like this, plain and simple. Ron Perlman's 2004 Hellboy STOMPS all over this version of Hellboy - and the magic is in his acting performance. Guillermo Del Toro's vision is one of a kind, which is the type of cinematic artistry needed for a film like this - see Blade II, Pacific Rim, Pan's Labyrinth, or his versions of Hellboy. The man has proven himself and was built for this. Neil Marshall doesn't have this experience - just look at his previous work for proof.If I had to say a good thing or two about this 2019 Hellboy reboot, is that the CGI looks pretty good. I appreciate the design of the monsters and I thought Milla Jovovich was excellent as The Blood Queen, but even her character suffers from a poor script. This is yet another comic book movie with a weak villain - not because of the actress, but because of the incompetence of the writers and director involved in this garbage.Skip this. You aren't missing anything.",Hellboy

373,hillman_mcfc,Not great not bas,6,17 April 2019,"Nowhere near as good as the original of course but nowhere near as bad as the critics are saying. It's fast paced jumps scene from scene, I also feel like there is needless use of bad language just to let us know its R rated. CGI over kill like every film these days, the music score isn't great and the humour and gags are cut short. It's good for what it is but nobody wanted another reboot we wanted a Hellboy 3.",Hellboy
374,Nikar4,Could've been deeper,7,4 July 2019,"Huge fan of the original so I expected this to fall flat as so many remakes and sequels do. But I actually really enjoyed this. It had the fun and charm of the original but the characters and background did lack depth.I feel they tried to squeeze so much in that they had to make sacrifices. For me there were plot holes and a huge lack of character build up. They relied heavily on spoken ""explanations"" for this that could've been shown visually and with more detail. Maybe they felt hellboy is already so well known or the other characters didn't merit such attention but it made parts of the story feel pushed or fabricated rather than the characters truth.For example the hog, we get a few lines about how Hellboy ruined his life but nothing to show how or why the life he had was so bad.Some cult try to kill him based on a vision but we don't see the vision or why they would turn on him so easily as in their own words ""he's done so much good and had so much potential""Any other film they would get away with being superficial but given Hellboys cult following I think they missed the mark and I understand why many fans feel robbed.With that said the actors were great, David Barbour filled Ron Perlmans shoes well. I agree they relied a bit too much on cgi but the quality of it was amazing.Taken on its own I still enjoyed the movie but I won't be rushing to rewatch it anytime soon. I can't see this gaining the same status as the original ever",Hellboy
375,bdolloff-63905,Save your money...,4,13 April 2019,After the first 45 minutes it's a dud. I give it a four for the special effects. The first movies were pretty good but after seeing this reboot those first ones are award winners.,Hellboy
376,PanamaVeggie,Solid Horror-tainment,6,2 January 2020,"COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS FILMS?
The change in Hellboy's appearance was jarring to me at first, but David Harbour's acting was spot-on. I loved the previous two Hellboy movies, directed by Guillermo del Toro and featuring Ron Perlman and Selma Blair, whose character was seriously cool. In addition to being fun action flicks they were visual feasts. This film, directed by Neil Marshall (nominated for an Emmy for the second-to-last Game of Thrones episode), not so much. Don't get me wrong, there are some really cool visual moments...and there's some really disgusting stuff, I watched quite a few segments with my hands over my eyes.WHAT TO KEEP IN MIND
I have to thank the reviewer (I believe it was lantzstumpp) who compared this one to a Sam Raimi horror flick, it put me in the right frame of mind to watch and truly enjoy this.THE ACTORS
I wish they'd given Milla Jovovich a bit more to work with, I'd say she's underutilized here. Loved Sasha Lane as Alice, especially at the end (in the early end credits scene), though some of her lines seem written for someone not quite so posh-sounding. Daniel Dae Kim's character seems like it's going to be very one-note at the start, but there's more development as the film goes on, so give it a chance.DO YOU EVEN LIKE HORROR?
I generally avoid scary films but there are some that are so good--comedic or otherwise--that I do have a list of favorites, including Scream and The Sixth Sense. If you're the same then you may well enjoy this film.WHY DID SO MANY RATE THIS 1-STAR?
These days you really have to sort through reviews, find the honest ones (hint- they're almost never the ones featuring one- or ten-star ratings) and splice together your own idea to figure out whether or not you'll enjoy a film. There are SO MANY TROLLS giving out 1-star ratings for (sometimes obvious, sometimes obscure) reasons. I don't know that there were any major political issues with this film or the folks behind it so my rating is based purely on entertainment value. The plot isn't terribly imaginative (some aspects I found simplistic and as one critic pointed out, it's a whole lotta lore packed into one movie) but, bottom line, it's a thoroughly engrossing blockbuster film.",Hellboy
377,bret-bannerman,"Wow. Any of you giving this weak, poorly written, and sadly acted movie...",2,22 February 2020,"...any kind of accolades, SHAME ON YOU. This movie is straight up AWFUL...AND will sadly(?), most definitely end the career of Daniel Dae Kim. Though seriously you didn't have much of a challenge in your role on Lost (basically being mute for like half the series) to begin with so maybe you always sucked. Ian McShane fire your agent, but obvi after your work on American Gods you are a God and therefore are safe. Milla SERIOUSLY you have sadly, officially failed...as if every other acting gig you've chosen hasn't been as bad or worse besides of course The 5th Element.In short I'm sorry but this movie was literally terrible.The fact that the terrible writers foolishly wrote several scenes at the end alluding to a further storyline - which would require you to gain access to monetary fund's to make another movie - after this atrocity is delusional and a little bit sad...no very sad.Soooo disappointed! So yeah: viewers don't watch this.",Hellboy

379,digigod-738-671527,Not Quite As Awful As They Say...,4,16 July 2019,"...But not very good either, and for fans of the Guillermo del Toro movies, a huge disappointment. This is not so much a reboot of a much loved franchise, more a cheap knock off to cash in on the name and headed straight for DVD remainder bins everywhere.I actually got some entertainment from it. The acting wasn't terrible, Ian McShane delivered his usual strong performance, the story was silly but, hey, it's Hellboy. It is silly. Humor was OK, I did actually laugh out loud at a couple of the gags. I don't know if it was budgetary constraints or just incompetence, but the CGI in this film looks like it was made in the 1990s, before Jurassic Park.If you've got a couple of hours to kill and are not looking for an intellectual challenge, this movie is an OK way to spend them, but like I say, don't be fooled by the name, this is NOT another chapter in the Guillermo del Toro franchise just a cheap 'B' movie featuring the main character. but without the panache of Ron Perlman.",Hellboy

Ron Perlman should always be hellboy this film would have done better with Ron Perlman.....has anyone ever thought of a hellboy curse...the actess from the 1st two movies all fell into issues..Anna Walton/Princess Nuala Stopped making movies soon after hellboy 2...Biddy Hodson/Ilsa Haupstein stopped being an actress right after hellboy...and Selam Blairs got MS....",Hellboy

However, this film's action, creepy creatures, jokes, and performances will keep you more than satisfied; at least until its obvious sequel-baiting.

There is zero scene cohesion and the editing is all over the place. It really made for uncomfortable viewing. You'd think the action sequences might at least be entertaining, but I found them incredibly dull to sit through.The dialogue and accents simply did not flow and the CGI was occasionally ropy - especially during the giant/ogre fight scenes.I wasn't daft enough to pay and see this at the cinema.

They kept the same cast and continued some of the story, except they brought back some characters alive and failed to carry over parts of the last movie (like Hellboy's girlfriend being pregnant).Overall the movie was pretty boring, they never elaborated on the villain's motivations or what they were trying to accomplish. They were just evil for the sake of being evil. The story didn't really go anywhere and it somewhat abruptly ends.Don't waste your time watching this, just re-watch the first movie.",Hellboy

And really simple,too. So that it leaded to having no any real challenges which the characters would face them and deal with them in an amazing way to encourage the audiences to watch! and they were all in a controlled, preset circumstances, as it looked to be a kind of mother caring for a little child not to keep aside from the true path which she knows that it's ""exactly"" the true path; but it's not...!Everything is arranged simply and in some parts, without any purposes and just to leave it to go through...

396,gpcheng87,"To borrow the words of Nimue's head in a wooden box: ""NO!""",1,25 July 2019,"2:17 in and I already know this train is in trouble.Context: I gave Hellboy 1 (2004) & 2 (2008) 6/10. For further reference, Pan's Labyrinth (2006) got 8/10 and Blade 1 (1998) & 2 (2002) also got 6/10. I was a little skeptical when I got wind this was coming out but was generally looking forward to it. Ok, ok - I'm a sucker for well-done CGI and the monsters looked potentially dope.Review: This movie is boiling cauldron of confusing. Is the prologue supposed to be comical? My first reaction (thinking it was serious) was, ""What? No. No..."", but then I saw Nimue (Milla Jovovich) scream ""No!"" when they locked the box with her head inside and it was so campy I figured that maybe they were spoofing Monty Python & the Holy Grail (1975, 9/10). You know, with the limb hacking by King Arthur and all? 24 minutes in and I'm still not sure what tone this movie is trying to strike. The soundtrack doesn't help... the jaunty ""The Devil You Know"" by X Ambassadors plays right after we see a monster handle her collection of human skeleton hands in a blue/black/grey scene (apparently, according to the Parent's Guide these are ""children's hands"", but there was no frame of reference for size comaprison in the scene so... *shrug*); this whiplash musical pattern continues throughout. The narration is annoying and should have set off alarm bells before filming - a well-written script would have rendered narration (voice or supers) unnecessary. Ian McShane's character here reminded me of a watered-down version of his character in American Gods (2017-Current, 7/10), a show that gets the mix of thumbs-up CGI and dark humor right. The antagonists look cool enough, but the things they say and the way thay say them make you roll your eyes (i.e. ""That is no concern of yours, beast. In the end, I'll have my way and Hellboy will pay what he owes!""); the good guys don't do much better (i.e. ""For the rest of you goose-stepping b------s, beware my claw for I have come to inflict justice on all of you."" Inflict?! ""Serve"" maybe... ""mete out"" or ""impose"", perhaps? ""Atrocious"", definitely.) The seer character is contrived; another narrator in the guise of a character that doesn't go anywhere. Any acting other than David Harbor and Ian McShane is so poor - I couldn't find a single scream, death, whimper or face of fear that didn't have a strange, prolonged pause that made it completely unconvincing. The rest (including DH and IM) do what they can with a equally strange, terrible script and lazy dialogue.Last Word: This feels like one of those choose-your-own-adventure stories except you don't get to decide anything, and every time the story takes a rabbit trail it's a different director at the wheel. Mignola, the audience, and David Harbour deserved better; I remember him from his excellent Law & Order: CI guest spots (2004, 2009) and loved him in The Newsroom (2012-2014) and End of Watch (2012). Come for the CGI (which was middling) like I did if you must; watch on mute with captions.",Hellboy

I expected a much worse experience. The film was entertaining. It had really good moments, great actors, some weird stuff, but it was nice. The CGI monsters are pretty good, the fight scenes and camerawork too. There are a lot of very nice and realistic characters, seems to be either figurine, animatronics or something else. There is also a debate and a couple philosophical thought.Cons: Near the end of the movie, things look good, but there is 1 CGI that is not so good. Some of the characters seem a bit comic reliefy, too humorous, to release the tension and lift the movie from the darkness. Which is understandable, or else it would be very dark.Overall I had a good experience.",Hellboy

402,lawrencestevens-58369,This ain't it chief,5,20 April 2019,"First off I haven't read any of the source material or seen the pearlman films in years so my knowledge of the source material is limited. However I can comment that the script is just so bad, with very cliche lines and moments. The acting from a lot of the supporting cast is quite poor as well with a noticeably poor English accent from Daniel Dae Kim. The comedy missed more than it hit and felt like it was trying to hard. There was a ridiculous amount of exposition that just bored me that kept coming from characters (particularly Ian mcshane, was probably 80% of his script). There was a hell of a lot of violence, I expected that and it was quite fun to watch but perhaps a bit too excessive and unnecessary at times. I give it a 5 because it isn't all bad, David harbour as hellboy was absolutely brilliant and carried the rest of the cast as well as I there was some nice action set pieces and choreography throughout (I particularly liked a one-shot like scene at the end). The cgi was a mixed bag, with some scenes looking good but some scenes at the end particularly laughably bad. Overall this film is quite poor and I don't recommend you see it in cinemas and spend money, perhaps wait till your drunk at home with some friends and watch it on tv or Netflix or whatever. That'll be more of a appropriate viewing experience",Hellboy
403,willohmsford,"Good VFX, too gory",6,24 April 2019,Just came from the theater. The movie was fun but too gory for my liking. I averted my eyes during some scenes.

404,foffster,"Harbour is great, the rest is not",6,21 July 2019,"Somewhat messy writing and directing that doesn't quite know what to make of the script, makes an otherwise perfectly cast David Harbour look much worse than he deserves. The story is ok, if a bit unimaginable, but there is a lot of bad and bland lines (and a few good ones from Hellboy: ""Quit when you are a head""). The other characters seems unevolved, but I guess Milla Jovovich will never get a good script to work with again. Too bad - I truly love this character and Harbour does good work here. Hopefully another director and writer can correct this.",Hellboy

406,badmel65,A slap in Guillermo del Toro's face.,3,15 December 2019,"I couldn't watch more than an hour of this. For one, no one can replace Ron Perlman as Hellboy. Secondly, the effects were severely lacking from the get go. Hellboy's face and horns are so poorly done, it was like looking at the bargain bins at the Halloween stores in November. The cast was just sad and the story is absolutely nowhere. The BabaYaga has been done to death with John Wick...and that said, why use it all all? Boring and predictable.
I longed to see what happened of Red and Liz and their soon to be children but this was just another version (and a poor one) of one of my favorites.
Adding D actors like Milla, who's lived off her husband's laurel's for what seems like forever, does not help.
Hellboy lacks the swagger and confidence of Ron Perlman and creative juicers of the original. There are no ""Ha, ha!"" moments either which I patiently waited for. No fantastic physical effects or romantic side story either.

413,Sam_Youno,David Harbour tries hard . . .,2,27 February 2020,". . . and that's about the only thing one can say in defense of this horrible film. The creators were clearly trying to make the movie faithful to the Hellboy comics, but jeez!---couldn't they tell how moronic those comic-book lines would sound in a live-action context? The dialogue might have been written by a 14-year-old; most of what were supposed to be witty one-liners are embarrassingly bad. The CGI is passable at best; most of the effects---particularly the giants---simply look computerized. The rock songs seem to have been dropped in randomly, as if a pounding soundtrack would automatically add excitement to a scene.
Harbour, in the midst of this mess, somehow manages to create a workable variant of the Hellboy character: heavier on the monster side, quicker to anger. In a better vehicle he would have been truly fun to watch. But he simply drowns in the unrelieved awfulness of the idiotic script, unoriginal cardboard characters and derivative plot. Two out of 10.",Hellboy

A little disjointed but with the COVID19 mess going on, it felt closer to home than usual. Maybe if I had seen it a few months ago it would've failed harder.The cast was horrid. Mila Jovovich is obviously incapable of an accetable performamce since The Fifth Element. David Harbour should've kept boring me in unwatched Stranger Things episodes. The dreadlocks-sporting diverse female #16, looking like a Burning Man reject, performed so poorly, that her best moments resulted in her being just annoying. Her accent felt like it came from the British version of the Bible Belt and was somehow more annoying than Mila's attempt at one.The CGI was like a throw back to the trashiest era of 90s sci-fi shows.

It was by far better than the first hellboy, but the second had a great story and cooler monsters. Had to knock off a few points because the special effects were not to par and the action scenes could get quite silly (sometimes intentional, but sometimes at inopportune times.)Also, Hellboy has some cool side characters in the first two (the fish guy and the gaseous German scientist). Don't recall their names, but they were cool as hell!If you're a fan of the comics, you'll probably hate it.

To say this was jarring is an understatement. Not even a die-hard effects fan (it seems many take this as a benchmark of worth over narrative substance these days) could claim the special effects were good in defence of the poorly executed story.I think even it's teen target audience would have found it degrading to their intelligence.I also doubt that even watching this in 4dx with water splashing in your face as your seats move could make this an enjoyable viewing experience.Don't bother with this film, if you are unfamiliar with Hellboy, read the original comics or watch Benicio Del Toro's original 2 movies.",Hellboy

The plot - awful. The script and dialogue - lame. The characters - mostly crap and uninteresting. But the mystery is HOW? Neil Marshall is NOT a bad director so how did this get away from him. You can only suspect that this was just too big a project for him. He's mostly a TV director and this just wreaks of someone being over their head and not being able to handle a project of this size. Some of the dialogue and cuts and direction are just plain weird! And I'm not talking about the monsters. Just normal things. The ending for examemple is just rubbish. Both of them. There's no point to them or reason. So in conclusion a lame script given to a B list inexperienced movie director and you get this.

The majority of the cast did too.It was great seeing a gory version of a gritty story too.It suffered from CGI overload with mindless and forgettable villains and never once seemed threatening.The supporting characters were good but their powers weren't used in a meaningful way in the film as per Guillermo DT's version. They were reduced to merely expositional features.The arc of King Arthur was not necessary, believable or well delivered It just screamed Hollywood desperation as per Transformers 5.And finally I'm sick fed up of Hollywood's inability to differentiate Britain and England.

It managed to pull a lot of smiles out of me. There's some surprising and fun imagery and gore, and David Harbour's take on Hellboy feels pretty spot on to me. He's grumpy, funny, sloppy, and tough as they come. The filmmaking quality is a little crude and dated, but it's totally watchable and easy to follow the action.The film doesn't hold much of a candle to the pedigree of the Perlman\Del-Toro version, but as B-level action\fantasy\horror I was plenty entertained.",Hellboy

425,austincoleman-66971,Completely squandered any kind of potential it had,2,13 April 2019,"Neil Marshall's Hellboy is based on the beloved comics/graphic novels created by Mike Mignola and is considered a reboot of the previous franchise led by Guillermo del Toro. In this story, Hellboy is in conflict between two realms (human and supernatural) that are both true to his nature. An ancient sorceress, whose MO is to rid the world of humans and rule the darkness that remains, tries to lure Hellboy into his ""destiny"" as the destroyer of all things and the fight for humanity unfolds.I had been keenly aware of the overwhelmingly negative reviews prior to going to see this movie. Although that was disappointing to see, I went in with as open of a mind as possible and really wanted to like this. Since del Toro's Hellboy duology came out over a decade ago, I have been fascinated with this character. I couldn't be more disappointed, and not just because I think del Toro's films are better, but because I think this is a genuinely bad movie no matter how it relates to its source material.The worst thing about Hellboy is by far the editing. Seriously, this is one of the most poorly edited films I have seen in a long time, maybe ever. This is the root of all sorts of problems. For example, it tries so hard at times to be funny by hitting us over the head with wisecracks, one-liners, and other random small character expressions. While this is typically true to the nature of Hellboy, the potential is completely squandered. The jokes never land because they are so poorly timed in the context they are in that not only is it not funny, it is cringey. The eye rolling at my screening was so strong that I physically felt it in the atmosphere at times. Another huge editing mishap is the transition between scenes and the roller coaster of confusion in tone that it coincides with. The flow of the story is so choppy in the way that it stops on a dime in shifting how it expects the audience to engage. One moment, we see a vile villain threaten the livelihood of mankind in an uber-serious monologue then, in the blink of an eye, we are ""treated"" to classic guitar riffs (the soundtrack is also mostly bad btw) while Hellboy rides on a horseback as if its supposed to be hilarious.I could keep going here about the editing, but it pretty much rears its atrocious head throughout the entire runtime. As a result, the film is a real slog to get through. A little over halfway through I was about ready for it to end.The movie tries to throw everything including the kitchen sink about the lore of this universe, yet provides little to no exposition. The only time this comes is in the form of a few poorly timed and toned flashbacks (back to the editing) that come far after we should probably be enlightened of them.There is seriously SO much going on here. So many characters are introduced at a lighting pace. We never get time to breathe. There are several moments especially early on that proved to be completely inconsequential, as I had forgotten they happened practically minutes later. It's a mess.The acting isn't all that great either. David Harbour is fine. But everyone else, particularly Milla Jovovich, plays their role with such little enthusiasm that I personally felt it impossible to engage with what was going on.The funniest part of Hellboy is the audacity of these filmmakers to try and blatantly set up a sequel in the mid/post credit scenes. Good luck with that.I hated this movie and don't think it is going to age well over time. By that I am extremely saddened. I'm sure plenty of people will still be at the very least entertained by it, and for pure entertainments sake none of the films flaws can ultimately take that away. But for my money, Hellboy is a sloppy disaster of a film and is now the gold standard for how NOT to make a comic book movie. That is something I never thought I would have to say again after Batman v. Superman but alas, I can't give Hellboy an ounce of undeserved credit.Why this is so bad doesn't make sense to me, and I don't know who to blame. I don't put sole responsibility on Neil Marshall (apparently he was locked out of the editing room post-production) or the actors or even the many producers who collaborated to put this together. At least some responsibility has to fall on everyone involved. If all the behind the scenes stories are true, this is a prime example of how destructive clashing creative minds that refuse to compromise can be. That is a damn shame.Thank God that the del Toro franchise actually happened. Fans of Hellboy can always go back to those to get their fix while trying to mentally erase this experiment from canon.",Hellboy
426,chrisagray-27399,Disappointing,3,12 April 2019,This movie had the potential to be so much better. Instead they fill it with unnecessary graphic violence.,Hellboy
427,julcltr,My Disappointment and Disgust are Immense,3,9 February 2020,"I feel tempted to ask, ""what happened?"" If there was a movie that had potential to succeed its predecessors while still remaining true to the comics, it was Hellboy (2019). Even though Hellboy 3 was never meant to be, as a fan of the comics as well as the original movies, I was willing to put aside my disappointment to get some enjoyment out of it. Yet, this movie is such a mess, I feel more resentful than entertained.The fact that this movie has an R rating is not what bothers me. The comics were not afraid to get disgusting at times, since the subject matter often dealt with fairly heavy themes of death, destruction, and the exploitation of lives in exchange for the slim chance of ultimate power. Hence, the inclusion of such heavy blood and gore was used in a way that felt natural in the comics. The movie, however, seems to be overwhelmed with their newfound freedom, because they crank not only the blood and gore up to eleven, but also the swearing and more unspeakable violence committed by the villains. What's supposed to be grown up and scary turns into something childish and vile - almost borderline disrespectful - because there seems to be no limits set on where and when to reel itself in. Not only does the movie force you to tune out in this way, but it also comes at the sacrifice of a coherent story and well-developed characters.Speaking of which, I've been hearing whispers about how the movie is considered a closer adaptation of the comics than the previous movies, since the writers incorporate other arcs that actually happened into the movie. This, however, is just an assumption made by those who haven't actually read the comics. By weaving so many storylines from the comic into the movie, it becomes disjointed to a point where several storylines become dangling plot threads that don't figure into the rest of the movie, or flat-out don't make any sense, especially when it gets several of them wrong in order to get the movie out of the corner they've written it in. The pacing also suffers from the multiple storylines. The first half takes on three different paths before getting back to the point, while the second half farts around with several scenes often going nowhere.The main characters also suffer from the terrible screenplay. While David Harbour and Ian McShane are good choices for the titular Hellboy and Professor Broom, respectively, they have nothing to work with beyond the typical troubled teenager and overworked parent tropes, once again, cranked up to eleven and made worse by the R rating and superficial adaptation. Hellboy is supposed to be a beast who, despite his frightening exterior and sarcastic attitude, has a big heart and always fights for the good of others, even if he knows that his destiny as the catalyst for the apocalypse will catch up with him one day. Instead, the writers turned Hellboy into a whiny brat who does nothing but get drunk and find more excuses to stick it to the old man, even though he has very little reason to do so. Meanwhile, said old man Professor Broom has been turned into a spiteful and cynical abuser who, as it's later revealed, actually considered killing Hellboy when he first saw him (!). Let me make clear that Professor Broom is not a killer! He would never even consider holding a gun in his entire life, much less killing a child he would later consider his son! It just brings more proof that crew who worked on this movie were more concerned with utilizing the R rating than getting the characters right. Several important supporting characters from the comic appear to be outright missing, leaving giant gaps where the movie feels like they should be included, while those they include in the movie are either under-acted or over-acted and often carry very little reason to be included.In addition to being disgusting, the movie is very ugly to look at in terms of its technical aspects and production design. The grime and grit covers this movie from top to bottom, while several scenes are obviously green-screened with some of the worst chroma keying ever put to film. Look closely, and you can count the frames where the CGI wasn't rendered properly. My brain was forced to tune out so many times, the movie gave me an actual headache by the time the credits were rolling... seriously.This movie is not worth sitting through, whether you're a fan of any pre-existing Hellboy media or not. It's not even worthwhile snark fodder; it just hurts. I can very well say that this is one of the worst comic book movie adaptations I've ever seen, and considering what else is available, that says a lot. Do not, under any circumstances, watch this movie.",Hellboy

So why did the witcher get amazing scores on imdb and not this?Granted the first scene with the vampire was pretty bad, they should of taken that out alltogether, and the pig monster was pretty bad but in a so bad its good kind of way.

430,lmadorski,"The ""Suicide Squad"" of 2019",2,13 April 2019,"I think my title sums it up pretty well. If you liked Suicide Squad unironically, I get the impression you will enjoy this movie. Personally, I hate Suicide Squad, but there's a decent amount to laugh at in the movie, which is very similar to Hellboy(2019). I haven't seen the original films in a while, so just keep that in mind. I remember enjoying them though.The one good thing about this movie was David Harbour. He did a great job portraying Hellboy, and even gave me one laugh at a point in the film. I also kind of liked the villains and his father, but not as much as him.While on the topic of positives, I thought(for the most part) that the monster designs were kind of cool to see, along with some of the locations. There is a certain location that a character is in that I found really cool, which if you have seen the movie, you know doesn't really add anything to it.The biggest issues with this movie are the story and editing. There's so much going on and the pacing is all over the place. Certain scenes drag out while others speed through important character development or any sort of explanation as to what is happening. A specific character shows up in the movie that is given no introduction, gives some exposition, and then doesn't show up for the rest of the movie. I feel like that scene was about two minutes in total.I'm just losing my train of thought trying to remember what even happened in this movie, so here's what I'll say. I got some good laughs out of this movie(99% unintentional), so if you're into that sort of movie, I would recommend it. As I said before, this movie has a lot of dependence on your thoughts of Suicide Squad. I think this movie suffers from a lot of the same exact issues, but if you like Suicide Squad, watch this movie.",Hellboy

If for some reason you wanted to see this movie, there will be spoilers:Since April, I have considered ""A Dog's Way Home"" to be the worst movie of 2019. Well guess what took that spot? I really only have one compliment to give this movie. David Harbour gives a decent performance as Hellboy and he is actually a little bit funny in this movie. That's it though. Everybody else feels like they're ready to be done, and get their paycheck. They even brought in some high class actors such as Ian McShane and David Harbour, (who like I said, was good), but that couldn't save this movie from awful writing, horrible direction, and atrocious cinematography. The costume design looks like it came from a low budget, unsuccessful Broadway play, and the CGI is just awful. But the worst part of this movie, is the villain. While I didn't mind the side villain, the pig (I don't care enough to find his real name), the Blood Queen is quite possibly one of the worst villains I've seen in a comic book movie. Also, this movie was way too gory for me, given that's just my opinion, some of you may love it. I can't tell you how many times I checked the time while I was watching this movie. This movie really was a chore to sit through. But every now and again Hellboy would make one of his smart- aleck remarks, and that's the only thing that held the slightest bit of my attention.

440,reaver80808-552-7999,The remake nobody needed...,4,3 January 2020,"What a strange beast this Hellboy is. The really glaring issue, is why did they make it at all? The Guillermo Del Toro versions of Hellboy were really nice movies. Sure, they lacked the violence and more grown up nature of the graphic novels, but they had great casting, good directing and excellent set, costume, and creature design. So why did we need another Hellboy?The Short answer. We didn't....at all!I like David Harbour, and he fits the bill nicely. He sounds how Hellboy seems he should sound, and he has the stature to physically play him. Likewise, Harbour's face does actually look closer to that of Hellboy in the novels than Ron Pearlman did. but man, oh man is he let down by the makeup department. His face looks like he just smeared in lot's of red paste. Which in truth, he is, but the viewer isn't supposed to know that. And his right hand of doom looks a lot like a plastic kids toy.The VFX are equally shoddy. I was going to compare the CG in Hellboy to video game cut scenes, but then I realized, video game cut scenes are actually far superior to the animation and composition used here. Physical characters seem to drift independently of their digital counterparts and everything feels blurry and cheap.The casting choices likewise are odd at best, and terrible at worst. Ian McShane, although a great actor, is just totally out of place as Hellboy's sympathetic, caring father figure. (A role nailed by the late, great John Hurt).
Milla Jovovich tries her best, but struggles to maintain a British accent, and it hurts her performance as a result. The poor dialogue just dooms whatever chance she had left.
The rest of the cast seem to have just been picked at random, without much real thought.
It is nice to see a more diverse cast however, and anything that bunches up the panties of the white power snowflakes, always gets my vote.It's a messy movie, with a weak script and it never needed to be made at all, but it gets a 4/10 because despite all it's faults, it's just about watchable, especially if you've run out of everything else on Netflix.",Hellboy

David Harbour is far better suited to play Hellboy, and his acting really helps carry the film. Visually, most of it looked great. There were a couple of moments that featured poor looking cgi, like a short shot of baby Hellboy and the creepily erotic Cheetah. Other than that, visuals were pretty fantastic. The violence was over the top and heavily featured, but that's what I expected from a proper R rated take on the comic. The scores were well suited for the scenes they accompanied.

Other than that though, a bit of a train wreck. Script/story, lighting, soundtrack, cinematography all combine to make this a bit of a train wreck. Even the special effects and make up were a step back from the 2004 version. I saw it for free and still managed to feel ripped off.

453,stafheyndrickx-490-681654,Awful...,4,28 July 2019,"There are only two decent actors in here, and they are totally miscast. The original two Hellboy movies where much better both an story and in directing. The story here is a mess, the music chosen is so predictable and wrong, and the rest of the cast just muddles along.... Seriously, just let Mila play nothing else but Resident Evil roles, the woman just can't play anything else....",Hellboy
454,yodaschoda,Just an ODD Movie...,2,13 July 2019,"Having seen and enjoyed the previous two movies in the franchise (in the sense that it features the same character(s), despite the reboot), I had high expectations. But lets get on with this movie...The issues with this movie are not few and far between. Nearly every aspect of it simply dosen't work with any other aspect of it... The end result is a movie that either tries to hard (or too little) to be something ""cool"". It's an odd mix of childish content, bad effects, bad acting, bad decisions, and bad writing.Childish Content: Hellboy himself is a complete and utter wreck of a character. His never changing look speaks of a low budgit production. And that look is a cliche version of the character. Trying to keep a low pofile while wearing a trenchcoat that can't cover ""Big Red""... And this same ""feel"" comes off with the absolute worst and pointless dialogue ever witnessed in a movie. Terrible one liners, superfluous swears... It comes off like something a little boy, about the age of 13 would think is ""cool"", ""badass"", and ""funny"" having just discovered swearing.Bad Effects: Just far too much terrible CGI. The end result are visuals that often are at odds with each other in terms of both look and feel, and the effect is a complete abscence of mood or relevance. Again, not sure if they tried too hard, or not hard enough... The end result is the same, though the implications of their intentions is concerning.Bad Acting: Two words ""Mila"" and ""Jovavich""... I have yet to see or understand how she has managed to escape a career in adult cinema. Easily a worse version of a female Nick Cage (worse because at least Cage can muster a 30% good ratio on his performances). She's flat, lifeless, and utterly ruins the movie... But she isn't the only one to blame... Everyone with speaking lines in this movie aught to hang their heads in shame. Like Nick Cage, we aren't quite sure if he tries too hard, or not hard enough. Again... The end result is the same.Bad Decisions: Not sure who to blame more... The studio for denying Del Toro and Pearlman the op to finish their trilogy... The director for every aspects of the movie... Those who casted the actors... Or the writers for creating this terrible script. All of it just stinks...Bad Writing: This, quite simply, is one or the poorest examples of a script I have ever witnessed on screen, save for the final season of GOT. Nothing makes sense... Nothing appears related... Nothing appears to have been thought out beyond how things would be created in CGI. In this last point, it appeared that the special effects were the tail wagging the dog.The end result comes off as a studio pandering to fans demands for another Hellboy movie, but only in so much as to produce a terrible movie which would stop their demands for any further... Such a waste of a franchise... Such a waste of time... Such a waste of money. To think of how much social good could have been achieved had these millions gone towards some worthy cause, rather than this disappointment.Yet another Hollywood let down.P.S. The music is just plain stupid throughout also and the score never really knows what it wants to be either... An Iron Man soundtrack with classic rock songs... Or something with an original score. Just another lamer the lame aspect of this tripe movie.",Hellboy

456,jeremiahlhorton,"Very Random, but ALMOST Worth It",3,15 April 2019,"Okay, so Hellboy wasn't exactly expected or NEEDED to be reboot in my opinion. I caught myself continuously biasing the movie before its release because who in their right mind would replace Ron Perlman????? Anyways, I went to see this at a drive in which was much cheaper than theatres. In some sense, I'm glad I did, in other sense, I wished I've paid an extra three dollars to see what was actually going on. The story was clunky and felt like it was rushed and crammed together multiple plots. There's nods to various portions of the comic books series which I enjoyed. An overuse of too much gore and characters that you don't really get a chance to like or dislike. I was like MEH the whole time during the movie, even when innocent bystanders got killed. The CGI effects were hit and miss. Some were down right TERRIBLE... and some were good. The actor played as Hellboy was a bit stiff and often times seemed unrealistic. I tried to take this movie seriously since the ONLY character that was serious throughout the film was Nimue played by Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil film series). And even her character seemed overplayed and eventually tarnished later in the movie. There are almost a hundred questions that were unanswered and maybe I just missed important parts of the movie. Maybe I need to rewatch it on the big screen and pay attention to the dialogue. Overall this movie is only worth a 6, but I give it a seven considering I'm going back to make sure I didn't miss anything.Good:-the large lineup of cast members both veterans and newcomers alike
-several comic book elements
-visuals and costumes are like mideval to modern day
-some comic reliefBad:-clunky CGI almost unrealistic
-rushes and confusing story line
-lack of fight scenes
-finale was God awful
-unlikeable/unrelatable characters
-Too many random switching scenes
-far too much blood and gore",Hellboy
457,lukehasenfus,Um... no,2,12 April 2019,"Okay so I am a fan of Del Torro's Hellboy but this is like a completely different book. I have to admit, the CGI in this movie are out of this world and are very good, but that won't even help the fact that this just had terrible directing and screenplay. I felt as if my 13 year old self would go nuts for this type of film but the amount of gore and blood was just so unneeded! I felt like I was forced to watch the most gruesome movie ever... in Hell.

The only thing that was a complete waste of time was Steven Graham as that silly warthog with that silly accent, just did not sit right within the movie. I think David Harbour did well, and given another chance with a better director I think there could be a much all round better movie for the hellboy fans.",Hellboy
459,LoganJEcclesLoganSmash,For TRUE Hellboy fans,6,14 August 2019,"Ok, I know I didn't give this a super high rating but I did rate it higher than IMDBs' 5.2. Now being a fan of ""Stranger Things"" I was super excited when David Harbour(Hopper) was cast as Hellboy. And boy did he nail it! All the cast and crew nailed it. You could tell what they were going for as soon as the movie started.Before I go on with my Review fans of the Ron Pearlman Hellboy who are expecting this one to be the same especially after the first official trailer came out and it did just look like the same movie. It is not. I repeat IT IS NOT. Director Neil Marshall and screenplay writer Andrew Cosby made a movie more based on Mike Mignolas' comic. I know, I know, some of you are reading this going ""so did Guillermo idiot!"" And yes you are right but this film is Centered around the work from start to finish. I felt like I was watching a comic. As soon as it starts black and Wight with only red popping out it gives that Hellboy comic tone. Even the makeup and structure of Hellboy in this film look more like the comic.Though the story is somewhat similar to the original movie it is just enough different to set it apart. The ensemble of characters does a good job of that. The set up of the new characters is great and they feel like they belong as opposed to just being replacements like I thought theywould be. Sasha Lanes' Alice and Daniel Dae Kims' Major Ben Daimio are great and different. When they finally come together as a full-fledged team, in the end, I was ready for more. As unlikely as that is I hope they do get a sequel because it showed potential for one and it was really fun. However, I am sorta glad I didn't see it in theaters I feel like its a better-enjoyed movie for home.",Hellboy

However after reading all the negative comments I decided to go back and watch the original since it had been a few years. Honestly - I think I actually prefer the new movie. There's a lot to like here. Sure - it's completely different than the original, and if you're expecting hellboy to be like the 04 version you will be surely disappointed.

I would love it if they made another one where it was just hellboy going through hell slicing up demons going to find satan, and then tuning into doom guy.

I enjoyed the grittiness of this rendition and the fact that though Hellboy has a sarcatsic streak a mile wide the movie wasn't played for laughs, which to me was certainly a bonus. The biggest downside and the biggest turnoff for me was the fowl language, it spoilt what could have been a really good movie, it simply is not necessary and is an unwanted addition which 'almost' made me walk out well before the end. I endured though because there are very few movies I've walked out of.

Unfortunately, the writing is bad and the acting is hit and miss, with some characters delivering a decent performance while others are just cringeworthy. The movie is quite cheesy and the humor is rough, again this mostly goes back to the poor writing. I found myself just wanting it to be over a little over halfway through and it didn't get any better. The story and characters are disjointed, nonsensical, and very forgettable. It's hard to think of anything redeeming about the film, which is unfortunate because I was very much looking forward to a good, fun, and exciting viewing experience.

480,haydenagain,RIP Hellboy....,1,21 November 2019,"The Hellboy remake ever since the first trailer was already a clear sign of a beloved comicbook characters demise in a nutshell. First of all, I loved the first two movies and Guillermo Del Toro (A Hellboy fan himself) brought these films and the source characters to life so well that they still continue to be acclaimed to this day. They were extraordinary works of art that developed their own tone and style which worked well. Then as we know by now what studio execs are like, all they're interest in is a big, fat, cash cow.I have no idea why Del Toro couldn't come back to do a Hellboy 3 to begin with. Because the second movie was still a sure-fire hit which could have had a sequel in the next three years from then. Eventually, that chance was blown in favour of a remake which eliminated any chances of Guillermo Del Toro returning to finish his Hellboy trilogy.With this remake, everywhere you look feels as if an emo teenage was hired to write the script to prove how edgy he can be with the R Rating. Instead, we get 120 minutes of non-stop sadism, edge lords, laughable scares, terrible special effects and a lot of childish profanity that makes even the Wolf of Wall Street look well mannered.What's even more pathetic, regardless of it being a box office failure and a career killer, David Harbour and Milla Jovovich tried to defend this film saying that it will be a cult classic. I'm sorry David and Milla, but what you fail to realise is that your film needs to appeal to fans in order to be a cult film. And safe to say, everyone is laughing at you. Del Toros films in our view are worthy to be considered cult-films because of their innovative and ethic design, but your movie is not that.Truth is, the Hellboy remake, right or wrong sucks. It will never ever live up to the first two films and David Harbour is not the Hellboy we wanted to see ever in comparison to Ron Perlman's Badass take.

On the downside the soundtrack is really cringey and I think it killed the mood of the movie.BUT HEY !It's cool to finally see some blood in the Hellboy universe!

He is the spawn from hell. So everything that comes with that should be included in the movie. And the movie rewards you with all that gore and then some.The movie is truly chaotic and I think it is a good thing. The pacing is really fast and surprisingly quite easy to follow even though I have not read any Hellboy comics I did not felt like I am missing references from the movie.Hellboy is stupid fun and it will help release all the anger build up in your system as you watch all that drama unfold.

485,kraftwerk32,Shockingly bad in every ascpect.,2,3 July 2019,"There are often movies that disappoint me, but rarely have I seen something that fails on every possible level like this ill-advised reboot of the Hellboy franchise. The CGI here is done so poorly that words fail me to describe it, in the 1990's this would have looked bad. But even in the non-CGI sequences it has the aesthetics of a cheap British soap opera (and hey, in a particularly low moment veteran Eastenders actress Laila Morse has a cameo. Oh yes! Mo Harris is in Hellboy). Why Hellboy is suddenly set in Britain is strange enough, but they overplay it in worst way possible. It's ""Fish'n'chips?"" here and ""I put the kettle on"" there. Churchill, Big Ben, Cornish pasty.
But beside all the technical shortcomings, what offends by far the most is that they managed to strip this reboot of every bit of movie magic that made the Guillermo del Toro films so delightful. There's no originality, no fantasy, no atmosphere. A complete lack of love for film making. I could go into more details, but why bother? Clearly the makers of this film didn't either.

491,KarlFranksMrGeeky,"A fun laugh out loud at times, blood, gore and splatter filled 2 hours.",8,20 April 2019,"My review for The Bloody Asylum that can be found at WordPress, Mr Geeky blog:Back in 2004 we were introduced to Hellboy, the cinematic adaptation of the comic books and character created by Mike Mignola, brought to the screen by Guillermo Del Toro and played by Ron Perlman. The sequel Hellboy 2: The Golden Army followed in 2008. Since then fans have been hoping for Hellboy 3 to finish off the planned trilogy. Ron Perlman over the years on many occasions publicly saying he wanted to make a third film. Unfortunately for him and fans that never happened.Now in 2019 we have a third Hellboy film that is a sequel of sorts and a remake. Mike Mignola this time being more heavily involved, co-writing the screenplay, and directed by Neil Marshall (Dog Soldiers, The Descent).Having now seen Hellboy 2019 I feel early reviews have been on the whole slightly unfairly negative. How can any film-maker produce a film that can compare to the original films. It is perhaps hard for some to not compare it to the original films, but is also unfair to. No one could ever match the unique visionary genius of Guillermo Del Toro. To be fair Hellboy 2019 does not try to emulate the style and vision of his film and characters. Instead it is far more a b-movie horror tinged creature feature, blood, gore, and splatter film.And there is copious amounts of fun filled overblown CGI Bloody Carnage!From the very first shot and voiceover it is clear this is going to be a very different less family friendly Hellboy. It does not have the depth of the original films but there is just enough with the character of Hellboy and his Dad to engage the audience and give some emotional edge at times. David Harbour was very brave to step in the shoes of Ron Perlman, but he plays Hellboy brilliantly with the material he has to work with. Ian McShane plays Hellboy's Dad far differently than John Hurt, and is fantastic as always. His scenes with Hellboy are some of the character highlights of the film. Milla Jovovich is superb hamming it up as the villain. Stephen Graham gives a fun performance as one of the creatures with his thick Liverpool accent being put to hilarious use, see if you can spot which one. Sasha Lane plays off of David Habour beautifully. The whole cast so obviously had great fun.At the end of the day Hellboy 2019 could have been better with more depth and the supporting characters being more fully rounded out. However, as a fun b-movie it is never ever boring and rattles along, and is a promising start to a franchise.My gauge of how much I enjoy a blockbuster film is if I want to see it again and to see sequels made. With Hellboy 2019 I can confidently say yes to both.A fun laugh out loud at times, blood, gore and splatter filled 2 hours.IT'S FUN AND BLOODY AS HELL!",Hellboy

David Harbour from ""Stranger Things"" fame takes up the role of Hellboy with Milla Jovovich as the main antagonist. You are certainly going to miss Del Toro's writing and direction, but not Ron Perlman, the original Hellboy. David did a fair job portraying the titular character. You will enjoy the movie if you are OK watching an R-rated, fast-paced, gory action sequences misfiring every aspect of the original Hellboy and sucking in every left-over folklore nightmare creature, loosely connected due to a weak storyline - it's just too much of undetailed and scattered imaginations. Besides, I believe a large part of the negative reviews are due to its obvious comparison with the Del Toro's original work, but then it's a reboot with a different director, writer, and a mint cast.

Yes, it would have been great to see their trilogy come to fruition, but it wasn't to be. It's a bummer, but is what it is. What we do have, now, is the opportunity to see a new trilogy happen. After watching this, I truly hope it happens.
Nobody can ever take away the great things that Perlman, Del Toro, and Doug Jones brought to the table, but David Harbour has brought his brilliant iteration of Hellboy in a big way. I thought he killed it! I enjoyed this movie from start to finish! There was not a full or draggy moment, not did it feel rushed. The CGI looked great, the practical effects we're beautiful and the acting from everyone was fantastic.
Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and if some truly did not care for it, that is what it is, too. I feel like many crap on reboots because they feel it disrespects the originals they love. I don't see why both can't have their own merits. It's like the endless DC vs Marvel debate. Some insist only one or the other is worthy of their time. Again, I'm a big fan of both.
Seriously! This was such a fun movie. I hope the negativity does not hurt the chances for a sequel or a possible trilogy, because I want to see more. I feel like this is a great one for anyone who loves brutally violent battles, strangely relatable disfunctional characters, or just 2 hours of nonstop fun. I will be buying this when it hits DVD, and I hope than many many more will too.",Hellboy
499,photobykjerstein,Pathetic and pure junk,2,29 August 2019,"Just the beginning seems junk - the narrator sounds like a child reader and a horror lesson.
The first 3 minutes don't exactly indicate that I'm super excited for the rest of the movie's 1 hour and 55 minutes.The same goes for Hellboy. We have been delighted with Ron Perlman Hellboy character as well as his dark, deep voice and now such a slightly more 'ordinary' hard voice + Hellboy's ""I have a gentle touch"" and the breaks the glass on his phone a split second after... bit two cliché for me.
Hellboy's father has also acquired a new personality, from calm and nice to a mad professor who curses a lot and yells at people.At a little show around Hellboy's origins, suddenly such a half-old, half-fat Captain America meets The Punisher wannabe shows up, who just ruins everything - with bad replicas, scenes that have been seen too often and plays so badly that it can get everyone feeling sick.In a monastery where monks are not allowed to speak but write on blackboards, a Hercules wildhog look-a-like emerges, Gruagach - who curses worse than the Sons Of Anarchy motorcycle gang - eats a monk's tongue and sounds like him for a second only to gain a bodypart for his Queen.
Looking back from when Gruagach was a child and wanted to be a regular human being, he is discovered by Hellboy and casted away... so when we see him as an adult 'beast' he clings as a 4-year-old is pathetic.The last, more or less, half of the movie is very much based on the fact that they have chopped ideas from the AVP and Predator films... just much inferior and with Harry Potter-like creatures.
Milla Jovovich overplaying her character, Nimue, so damn much.Just all the bouncing around all the time is annoying. Then they are in the process of fixing something in one city, then suddenly they are in another, then back to the first and then in a kind of underworld and so on to a new place.... was it just confusing, then that would be an improvement.Hellboy meets a wizard in a cave, where all of a sudden Hellboy is half-heir to King Arthur and the Excalibur sword - he predicts that he wants to wipe out the world and there you seriously see the bad CGI movie offers.If people are just furthest away from the two previous Hellboy movies, then for God's sake, don't waste time on this one.",Hellboy
500,reubenstojan,This one hurts!!,2,8 March 2021,"Unlike a lot of naysayers, I was generally excited to see a reinvention of the Hellboy character on the screen. While the Del Toro films were entertaining, they did deviate from the comics gothic sensibilities, so under a new direction, Hellboy fans could get their cake and eat it too.Well they got it. And goddamn send it back from wence it came. There is so much wrong here, its puzzling. From a pure story structure, the film is an absolute mess. Yeah, i understand you have to cover a lot of territory to introduce people not familiar with the rich universe created by Mike Mignolia but christ, not like this. Don't rush Hellboys origins through a quick 2 minute flashback. It requires its own fleshed out scene or you know, just don't include it in.",Hellboy

The jokes fell a bit flat, the action wasn't quite exhilarating enough and with no disrespect, Harbour is a fine actor, but no Ron Perlman! Not even close. The movie felt jittery - reading the trivia section on IMDB afterwards I can see that it was quite a troubled production. In general, I am disappointed as I suspect there will now be no more Hellboy movies!",Hellboy

Un-necessary remakes / reboots. Adding nothing to the mythology of the story. Don't get me wrong, this is not an entirely bad film, in fact, if the Del Toro movies didn't exist, I would have probably rated this film a lot higher. But they do, and this is lacking in comparison. I quite enjoyed the fact most of it was set in the UK, and didn't really find issue with the CGI, something a lot of people have criticised. But it has to be said that some of the acting was terrible and hammy. The character development was almost none existent. And Ian McShane was just soooooo camp, as was Milla Jovovich.The bottom-line is, yeah this is an ok film, but nowhere near as good as the Del Toro movies. I'm not sure if this was the setup for a Netflix etc, type TV series, which actually could work a lot better than a movie. Oh well. 6 stars and I'm being generous with that score.",Hellboy

If you are looking for a movie to watch with action, lots of effects, and predictable outcomes then look no more. If you are like me and are hoping for something more climactic than the first Hellboy Series, you wont find it here. I hear that this movie is more like the comics but I think the CGI was sloppy and over used and the plot was very ""meh."" But I gave this a five star because it itsn't one of those movies thats just impossible to watch. If you just want to kick back and enjoy some action for a couple hours then this will work.

511,scaradu,Where's the cigar?,2,17 April 2019,"I had low expectations going into this as the whole idea of re-making the Hellboy franchise from the beginning with a new actor and director was entirely aberrant. Sure, I am a big fan of Del Toro/Perlman but this is not an excuse for disagreeing with people who do not like it. It just was a bad film. Needless to say, my expectations were exceeded!If you haven't seen this one my advice is to just don't do it in the cinema (no need to support this kind of entertainment) or wait for the freaking DVD as that's where its quality stands. If you do plan on watching it, make sure you watch the other 2 movies AFTER because they're so much better that you wouldn't want to watch this piece of trite last.Coming out of the cinema I had one thought about it. I need to re-watch Hellboy 2: The Golden Army to wash this stink off of my mind. An awesome movie that puts to shame whatever the hell the guys in charge for this remake aimed at.Because it is nothing more than an over-bloated gore fest, folks. It lacks the subtle comical undertones of the first, the good, down to earth dialogue and relatable characters, the intriguing story, the fascinating cinematography and anything else that made the original 2 cult classics. Sure, they might not have broken any box office records when they released, but I assure you, a third installment by the brilliant Del Toro, combined with the glove-like portrayal of Hellboy by Ron Perlman would have cashed in much more dollars than this and, more importantly, it would have cashed in many of our hearts for years to come!Sure, David Harbour does a good job, but if that's the best thing that can be said about this flick, that the actor does a *good job*, than we can just conclude it doesn't have much else going for it.Also, where's the freaking cigar man?",Hellboy

It felt like they were trying to pack too much stuff into one film., so the story tended to wander- lets get Wild Hunt in, lets get Alice in, lets get Leopard man, Baba Yaga (which lead nowhere). The Hellboy makeup looked like it was melting into his chest and I get it they wanted a ""different look"" for the characters look, but looking like a mess didnt help. They try for an angle about "" why cant the monsters have a life too"" but the argument doesnt hold up when your dealing with things that feed on children's fingers and the marrow of humans. I know they wanted and edgier darker story, but showing people impaled and torn apart in full screen didnt add anything.

Without having watched the original or read the comics you'd be completely clueless as to what was going on. Some scenes are so bad that they are laugh out loud funny. For example in one scene they had a character known as The Lobster who was a Nazi hunter who wore a bright spangly uniform and kept threatening people with his nonexistent claws and this wasn't supposed to be funny. You could tell based on the scene. Then they had things that were disgusting for no reason. The original films you could watch with your teenage son but these are ridiculously gory and vulgar without much good reason. It didn't add anything to the film If anything it took away from it by distracting you. If you're looking for something that makes sense or has a solid plot or that you can watch with your kids then this isn't the film for you. All the heart and soul in the other film was replaced with mindless disgusting vulgarity, and don't get me wrong I love violence and vulgarity in film, all of this is done with exceptionally poor taste.

It makes for a messy script with massive pacing issues and way too many side characters. There's also a fair amount of gore and attempts at humor but due to the poor pacing neither have the desired effect.Let's go to the acting. For some reason they chose two American actors to play British characters (Lane and Kim) and they both deliver their lines with an English accent that's only slightly less ridiculous than Dick Van Dyke's in Mary Poppins. David Harbour does an admirable job as Hellboy but fails to bring the same depth to it as Perlman although he's not exactly being helped by the rather poor dialogue he gets handed to him. McShane and Jovovich are McShane and Jovovich. Not bad but nothing to get excited about either.The last part is about the CGI. It's 2019.

A number of characters important to the series and loved by fans receive a good amount of screen time. The practical effects are plentiful and extravagant, a sure treat for admirers of the craft.

While all these things seem to be really shaping the film up to be a hit, it unfortunately falls short in some respects.David Harbour's Hellboy, though a very well done performance overall, lacks the broodiness of the comics and Guillermo del Toro's adaptation and gives the impression of a frat boy looking for the next good time. On the flip side, Ron Perlman's depiction in del Toro's films, while somewhat emotionally mature, still knows he has a job to do and a dedication to it. Harbour's Hellboy largely comes off like he simply goes unwillingly where he is sent, and there's no real heart in his work.Ian McShane, though underrated as an actor, fails to capture the audience as Professor Broom, or even a fatherly figure. This seems to be partly due to the fact that the dialogue scenes with McShane and Harbour together are fairly superficial, and also partly because there doesn't seem to be a tangible chemistry between the two in their on-screen presence.
In kind, Milla Jovovich as Nimue doesn't convey the same menace as Nimue in the comics. For a 5th century witch bent on revenge, she seems rather tired of it all, a little bit too demure in actions and voice to really convince the viewer that she's as much of a threat as the characters are telling us the whole way through. Even when she's actively melting people's faces off it seems casual. These lackluster impressions may not be a consequence of the actors' abilities, but due to the script and direction. Thankfully, Daniel Dae-Kim and Troy Jones & Emma Tate as Ben Daimio and Baba Yaga respectively, make up for these shortfalls with performances that satisfyingly capture the spirit of their characters.The soundtrack had a chance to be a perfect compliment to the visual effects, but it felt somewhat inconsistent. With orchestral pieces in one scene and hair metal in the next, it didn't have a good flow and as a result ended up dulling scenes that could have been enjoyed more.Finally, some of the character introductions were very rushed and seemed to follow a pattern of a character practically being pushed into a scene, dialogue that served as an obvious segue into a short backstory, and then quickly back to the present scene with them running off to fight monsters. For those acquainted with the comics, this isn't much of an issue but for newcomers to the Hellboy franchise these hurried introductions will leave them a bit confused and wondering exactly why some of these people are so important and how it is that they seem to have become such fast friends with the other protagonists.While the decadent visuals scratch the itch for fans who have been anticipating the reboot, the shortcomings cripple the film and keep it from reaching its full potential.",Hellboy

I was in dillemma whether to turn around and go back home, just forget about the movie. But then in my mind, ""Ah, the hell with it"". I drove straight to the cinema with no more second thoughs. YOLO. After watching it, damn that was the greatest decision ive ever made, no regrets and no guilt at all. I watched all the way through until the end. I love this version of Hellboy! not that I dont like the Del Toro version of it. Just act at it as a whole new take to the hellboy series. Love the GORE! Humor and the action! I just dont understand why the hate and bad review! of course the del toro version is a 11/10 for me but still. Im entertained and enjoyed the movie!

I had zero interest in seeing this because I never liked the other two Hellboy movies. Well, those other two movies were awesome by comparison! This is one of the few movies that I now own that will never be watched again. I know this doesn't resemble a review, so I'll try and provide one. This movie has very little character development and relies heavily on CGI effects. I never felt entertained at any point during the movie. The villain is cute and the hero is revolting. There are a few brief fight scenes and nothing worthwhile. This movie will never see a sequel and the reviewers giving it a 10 rating are surely being paid to do so. Dragonball Z has a 2.5 rating and is more entertaining. There was once a time I looked to the IMDB ratings to determine if I'd watch a movie. Now I just try watching 20 minutes of a movie.",Hellboy

I constantly felt like I was missing important backstory in this version and with the movie being 2 hours long it should have had time to bring us non-comic readers up to speed.Moviegoers seemed disengaged and no laughed during what was supposed to be comedic moments. I was never drawn in. It was a struggle for me to sit through it and I found myself wishing it would hurry up and end. 3 people actually left an hour into the movie.I love David Harbour, and he was okay in this role but not enough to save this move.

The Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense. Let's talk about this unprepared Mickey Mouse operation. What do you think they'd use for weapons in apprehending paranormal beings? Some kind of energy sucker like Ghostbusters, maybe? Or some new, state of the art plasma gun introduced to us specifically for this movie? Nope. Regular guns. That's right. They have billions of dollars for high tech facilities in the Colorado mountains and London and plenty of manpower but nothing in the way of taking down a particularly nasty apparition. You'd think they could be a little imaginative in their writing and give the BPRD a weapon that could at least plausibly kill a spirit. That is their business after all.
Then again, maybe the writers were trying to give us the feeling that the BPRD was an overfunded government program that blew all its cash on expensive buildings(Winston Churchill's desk??), locations and transportation then had nothing left for what they actually needed the money for -which is the very definition of today's government!

I was exited for the third Hellboy film, only to discover it was cancelled and then came this awful reboot.First off, the plot is confusing jumbled mess of a story that can't decide whether it wants to be Dark and Edgy or fun and comedic like the original movies. What happened to Hellboy's sense of humour? I mean this is Batman v Superman levels of Bad.Secondly, the cinematography is terrible, including Hellboy's design. I have seen PlayStation 1 FMVs with better CGI than this movie. Come on film makers the original Hellboy and Hellboy 2 looked better than this and the first one came fifthteen years prior while the second one came out eleven years prior to this.Thirdly, the director Neil Marshall who directed the critically acclaimed Dog Soldiers and The Descent (two of my favourite movies) has had a terrible track record since the infamous Doomsday. He is a hack of a director who should be ashamed of what he's done.Lastly, David Harbour is miscast for the role and lacks the charm of Ron Perlman. Milla Jocovich (Alice from those terrible Resident Alice movies) was an automatic red flag when I saw her in the movie. Don't even get me started on the films 15 rating compared to the PG-13 originals.This movie just insults the fans of the franchise and comic books. Please just avoid this stain on Perlman and Del Toro's legacy. Lionsgate should have known better. This movie gets the final verdict of a 2/10.",Hellboy

The characters are a refreshing change from the black and white characters and storylines we've been inundated with from Marvel, and to a lesser extent DC, and a truly R-rated take, replete with language and full on gore make this a real standout in a saturated superhero market.Mila Jovovich carries her character well, but it's really David Harbour, Ian McShane and Sasha Lane that made the movie.It's dark, violent, over the top, but full of irreverent humour, colourful characters, a good, if well-trodden storyline, and just enough Hellboy lore without drowning the movie in backstory.Don't watch it expecting Ron Perlman or a greatly sanitised Hellboy, but watch it for what it is, a great romp.

IT like if you did Return of The Jedi first. When you dunk the ending the storyline in the comics has been leading to for years as the start where the heck do you go? The budget was incredibly low and you could see it, fight choreography and action choreography just rubbish. Sometimes CGI looked ok but sometimes it looked really bad. Baby Hellboy was appalling and quickest of shots for obviously that reason.Writing my gosh. It was utterly terrible. We had multiple storylines being attempted but if you took all of them away the main storyline would have been 50 minutes. It was desperately trying to go for a Guardians of the Galaxy or James Gunn vibe but utterly failing miserably with horrendous scenes that had thought itself to be witty or funny and it was nowhere near. Some of the writing sounded like a 12-year-old. Graphic Gore that was just done for the sake of gore. The acting was majority poor from everyone. Ian McShane did his best, David Harbour wasn't too bad but appalling characterization of Hellboy. Making him uncool. The other cast is really good actors and proven in other stuff but I just don't know what they were doing in this movie.Also, the promo was trolling-- showing stuff that is in for a minute or 2 if that but used in trailer or promo as if be longer. Also, Hellboy's hair looked terrible.I do wish they hadn't been stingy and gave it a proper budget and had Del Toro. One star may seem harsh maybe it could be two or three but it was just a bad film.

602,SCIFIshant,Action Packed Fun From Start To Finish!,8,19 April 2019,"I truly feel that the reviews for Hellboy (2019) have not done the film justice. I feel as though this film utilized it's 50 million dollar budget quite well. Most films these days have a budget two or three times that. I loved the action-packed fights and the satisfying visuals.Watching Hellboy slice and dice ghoulish foes was just so refreshing and satisfying and it showed me that they really tried to give the film a unique visual style. I feel that the budget does show it's downsides in some scenes, but for the most part I do not feel that these cons outweigh the pros. Another thing I loved about the film was the use of dark humor. The humor in this flick was well utilized, gritty and unique compared to anything I have seen in a long time. The story was also very well done. I felt that they really did their best to explain everything about the Hellboy universe in the 2 hour run time they were given and I appreciate this film for expanding my interest with this franchise. Definitely a fun movie to watch and one you should definitely check out at least once!",Hellboy

I have been for this since it was announced that they were making another one.I was hoping for Ron Perlman to come back for one last take on it because I like the original two. I enjoyed them with a passion, but I enjoyed this one too.It isn't as bad as people make it out to be. It's bloodier and rougher on the language, but it is still a great movie.Those of you who read this might already have mixed views on this take, but it is worthy watching! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a darker take on this character. And Harbour makes the part his own. He part of the reason I loved this movie so much!",Hellboy

I think in years to come it will probably be reappraised. I remember that the 2004 incarnation didn't fare too well with critics either. It was much later that people came to it.

609,jameslincoln-69115,Hellboy 2019,6,13 July 2019,"Hellboy 2019 is better than the predecessors in my opinion,and really shines in the comedy department with a few laughs and giggles. and I think the actors did a brilliant job especially hellboy thought he was good looking. And I thought the end of the movie was spot-on with another plot point.Things I didn't like about the movie were the terrible CGI moments especially the scene with the three giants on the field didn't think it was necessary about all of those horses and men with futuristic machinery didn't make sense to me. In other parts of the movie the CGI wasn't too bad, but definitely needs to be improved in the next movie integration. The reason I say this is better than the first one or the second movie is because with this movie I haven't fallen to sleep I haven't looked at my phone it's kept me mostly on the edge of my seat. But the answer is do I recommend watching this movie absolutely yes if you're into hellboy or in general. If they make a sequel to this movie I am all for it but all I can say is please make it right.And I think my rating of this movie 6 out of 10 is fair.Things to fix
CGI.

CGI characters voice acting definitely needs improving.Hoped you liked my opinions and thoughts",Hellboy
610,denyanviegas,Ad good as the first Hellboy,7,15 February 2020,"Seriously, what is all this hate about? It's not as terrible as the reviews made me think, puting the first Del Toro Hellboy and this movie side by side, it's almost identical, the same qualities (funny, charismatic and interesting characters) and pretty much the same defects (too simple story and villain, not much relatable characters, and a mediocre/""tasteless"" ending).
I don't think CGI is that bad, actually i think is good at all, acting is ok, so i really don't understand why there's so much hate about this movie.

I do not understand why viewers have given such a low rating. The movie does justice by Hellboy and you never lose interest. Excluding a character (the big cat), it is a very good action / fantasy story. Sure it could have more horror elements in some parts and a darker tone.

615,RobotBearUprising,Fail fail fail,2,10 March 2021,"I really love the Hellboy character. From the first inception in the comic books and certainly the first two original movies. But not even the great Ian McShane can save this failed reboot. The Guillermo Del Toro movies were by far superior as movies. Granted this reboot has more blood and gore, the story just lack depth and it is messy af. And the dialogue isn't so much spoken but rather shouted throughout the movie. Its just terrible. The actor who plays Hellboy should be shot. He screams the dialogue the entire movie. Why!? I would say that this should be given a miss and to watch the original movies. They are certainly more enjoyable.Update 16 May 21- I also noted after going through the reviews, a lot of the 10/10 reviews are done by bots or people who made the film because they are literally copy and pasted from different accounts.

Nice story, different place of story, some twists were made.

618,KinoCynic,Still one of the worst films I've ever seen,1,4 September 2021,"Hellboy 2019 is insipidly bad. My no-longer friend, partly because of this film, said we should watch it at the cinema. When we saw the rightly deserved negative reviews, he said it'll be a 'so bad it's good' type of film. Nope.What Hellboy is, is a film that is tonally deranged, unnecessarily gory and completely unlikable. The plot is generic and has to use dumb sweary humour and people being ripped apart to stay entertaining. This isn't the fun type of gore, just miserable and shocking for the sake of it. At the same time it's trying to tell a serious story but jeez, who the hell cares when the film doesn't care.The film is also unacceptably technically flawed for a hollywood movie. Sound mixing is non-existent. One minute characters are talking quietly then BOOM HERE IS A LOUD ACTION SCENE ARE YOU STILL WATCHING LOOK HERE IS SOME GORE
You can't see the screen a lot of the time too. Probably for the best actually.The absolute worst part of the film is the section with Baba Yaga. Hellboy feels marginalised for being a monster in a human world, so runs away to the monster world. Hellboy comes across Baba Yaga who hangs children from meat hooks and cooks and serves them to him. So the film poses the question 'Are monsters misunderstood? Is Hellboy right?' and answers it with infanticide. What writing.Not fun at all and no redeemable qualities. Somehow boring and loud and obnoxious. No care given. Hell, even this review I wrote in a few minutes has more thought put into it.",Hellboy
619,bannerninja,Getting a lot of hate - not entirely deserved - closer to the comics that before,7,15 August 2019,"This movie is getting a lot of hate and I think it is not entirely deserved - a lot of it seems to be ""this is not Del Toro - hate it!"" I will admit to maybe being to close to the subject matter as an avid Hellboy reader of many, many years, but this is much closer to the comic book source than Del Toro's version ever was and if the director/script writer/producers had stuck to that strength, it would have been a serious reboot.
Instead there is a strange tendency to wanting to pay homage to the Del Toro version, which only waters down the overall impression and impact of the movie.If this movie deserves hate for anything, it's for the atrocious use of random rock music for action sequences, which seems like the way a 14-year-old would score this movie, instead of using a proper musical score. It outright ruins the enjoyment of these sequences.THIS is actually much, much, much closer to the comic book Hellboy instead of the thug buffoon that Del Toro created and which I must admit I was annoyed with. Characters from the books are shown very close to their book counterparts, but I fear there is too little overall context for anyone not well-versed in the comic books.
I think David Harbour was actually a wonderful Hellboy and could easily have carried more movies - but I think that is not likely to happen.The main Achilles heel of this movie is that it takes the story lines The Wild Hunt, The Storm and the Fury and elements of Darkness Calls and the short story Hellboy in Mexico and mash them together to create one movie. This means unsuspecting movie goers are subjected to a barrage of characters and there is too little time to properly describe and represent them.For Hellboy readers, there is a fun visit with many classic characters but it is wrapped in a storyline that wants to do too much. I can't help but feel this would have been better served being turned into a TV show.For the casual moviegoer, there is too much going on and too many characters being introduced to really appreciate it all. It is a fantasy/horror rump that is no better or worse than the two previous movies.For Del Toro fanboys, this is a movie that doesnt bow down fully to the predecessors and neckbeard rage will ensue.",Hellboy

CGI is somewhat on the cheap side and usually looking like a PC game.
In the end, I sat and watched 2 hours of it and enjoyed most of the time.
There are few scenes with gore and violence and usually this leads to low score .. I'm fine with that.

625,MadMike77,Enjoyable Reboot.,6,12 April 2019,"Keeping this short and sweet. Negative points, the story telling was messy at times and a little all over the place, although the mythology that was added was cool. The whole opening scene could've been cut and it wouldn't have made a difference. It had a couple small parts of dodgy CGI.Overall though it was entertaining and fun. It had solid acting. To separate itself from the original 2 films as it needed to, it ramped up the violence and gore and had plenty of swearing in it, hence the 15 certificate. Would I go see and even welcome a sequel? If it keeps the same darker adult tone, yes.Now, compared to Del Toro's 2 films, the only real comparison is that David Harbour played the character of Hellboy pretty much the same as Ron Perlman did, as the character should be played. Everything else was different, because let's face it, Del Toro's visual style is stunning. The production, set, and costume design is his trademark. Overall, they are both better films than this reboot.",Hellboy

Since it was a remake of the original movie of sorts predictably it couldn't all be about Hellboy and had to be about some other things so I get that. But the director went out of his way to make it overtly satanic. It was chock-full of the occult and demonic villains.

Too much CGI, too many stupid jokes and fast camera cuts make the action hard to grasp.Too often the story jumps from scene to scene without any logic, from past to present and back again, without any clear explanation. The overall effect is close to a TV commercial, and whatever substance is there goes lost.David Harbour does a decent job as the main character but it's still far away from the highs reached by Ron Perlman in the original movies. He just doesn't have the same attitude or experience in ""taking over"" a scene. The same goes for Milla Jovovich, straight out of Resident Evil with her blank stare.Hellboy is still fun as a generic action movie and a few scenes are really spectacular.

648,misho-29395,"Terrible Writing, Weird Directing and Awful CGI",2,20 April 2019,"Watching this, it feels like a twelve-year-old wrote the screenplay by tacking together scenes that might look cool without giving any thought to what the dialog would sound like when spoken out loud by human beings. Ian McShane does his best to sound convincing, while some of the other actors don't seem to see the point in even doing that and it's hard to blame them. There are plot holes throughout and segments that make little-to-no sense and add nothing to the story, although would maybe look neat if the effects were any good. The whole thing generally feels like someone slapped together at least four or five stories and tried to turn them into a coherent whole, which wouldn't surprise me, although I don't know enough about the comics to say for certain.I'm not sure where to place the blame for the awful pacing, but the movie is just unrelenting. There are times when things should wind down, but then it's just more noisy stuff happening. For example, at one point a character is in need of specialized medical attention and they find out it'll be a fairly-long and ""treacherous"" trek to get it. The character is then cured within 1-2 minutes of runtime, the trek portion being a few seconds of that, then we jump straight into some exposition, then we jump straight back to what we were doing before, presumably after a long and treacherous trek back that also happens instantaneously. To get an idea of how jarring this feels, imagine if Gandalf told Frodo about what it would take to destroy the ring and the next scene was at Mount Doom.The direction is mostly just odd, and I have no idea if it's because the director couldn't figure out what was happening in the script or because someone was meddling with his work.Finally, the CGI monsters look terrible.

As a Ron Perlman fan, I felt Harbour had a hard act to follow, yet he ticks all of the same boxes with gusto. He also seems to be having fun in the role, which, as a viewer, I often found infectious. If I go to see the sequel, it'll be down to this alone.Unfortunately, everything else about this film feels flimsy and inconsistent. Hellboy is a vanquisher of the most horrible creatures imaginable, yet a few people can cause him trouble; certain scenes are uncannily realistic (especially with the Babayaga) yet others feel like Saturday morning children's animations, and characters proved to be fierce and formidable by their actions just don't feel threatening.Worst of all, Mila Jovovich is a depressingly bad actress.

I wemt into this movie with high hopes regardless of reviews read, specially with it being linkes to the marvel universe now snd hellboy making an appearance in black windows upcoming solo movie.
I was hoping with an r rating it would be on the same level as deadpool and logan, this is r rated for the wrong reasons, the violence wasnt over the top warranting an r rating and the swearing wasnt funny or tbh even really necassary, having a r fated film is pretty much having an open book with the likes of being able to do whatever you want
It was comedic in parts like hellboy comics but there was nothing spectacular about this movie at all, the swearing felt forced like they just wantes to throw an f bomb on for the sake of it and the action was very poorly executed with some poor cgi.
So much more could of been done with this movie, did i enjoy my time at the movies yes, is it a masterpiece or something i will race to see again no way
If your looking for mindless action and a story that isnt overwhelming compelling for sure watch this but if your expecting iron man with a r rating it def doesnt live up to any of tne marvel hype.",Hellboy
661,lavender230267,Went to see wanting to hate,8,17 April 2019,"I am a big fan of Ron Pearlmans Hellboy. That being said I actually kind of liked it, if you take away from some of the appalling accents being used I thought it was a good revamp. As I said I was expecting to hate it. But I enjoyed",Hellboy
662,dionduffin-833-963149,Definitely not worth the hate.,8,11 April 2019,"I love Hellboy, the first film I remember watching was the original Hellboy. I grew up on Hellboy and of course it was hard to exit from Del Toro and Pearlman's shadow as their movies were amazing. Now I feel Hellboy has grown with me as now I enjoy the excessive gore. Of course this movie wasn't perfect my main problems being a reasonably weak villain and the lack of build up with Professor Broom and Hellboy relationship but a things considered it was still an enjoyable movie that I will watch again and pray that it earns a sequel.",Hellboy
663,svalencia-97-849298,Don't believe the negative reviews,9,14 July 2019,"I almost never write a review for a movie, just rate them and move on, but in this case I just felt compelled due to all the negative reviews. No, this isn't a Guillermo del Toro film, but it is most definitely still worth watching. I wish people would stop being so harsh on reboots. Ron Perlman did great on the original movies, but David Harbour does it even better. The story isn't full of holes as most claim, it's perfectly adequate. Just watch it with a non bias attitude and you're sure to really enjoy it.",Hellboy
664,johnott1864,Hellboy replacement doesn't work.,2,27 July 2019,"It's like taking the Lord of the Rings trilogy and in the 3rd movie changing directors to Tim Burton and replacing Aragorn actor Viggo Mortensen with Bruce Willis. ....it's too much of a change and dosn't work. Whereas Ron Perlman seemed a sympathetic and somewhat approachable character, David Harbour is a more sinister, cold and irredeemable version. Couldn't get past Harbour's grim appearance. He was an extremely ugly Hellboy.",Hellboy

667,grahamedmonds-12461,"Gory, Glorious, and Fun as Hell",10,19 April 2019,"Walking into the new Hellboy reboot, I knew exactly what I wanted, and Neil Marshall delivered just that. Is it different than the del Toro films which are excellent in their own right? Yes, but the film stays faithful to the comics and basks in its own gleeful take on what it means to be human, and more importantly- an outsider. Hellboy reads like a fun, rowdy, anti-hero movie with tons of gore and dark humor. David Harbour and Milla Jovovich bring especially memorable performances. If you know what you're in for, and love movies that put a unique spin on overstuffed genres, you won't regret seeing this!!!",Hellboy
668,mike_larosa,Really enjoyed it.,9,25 July 2019,"This movie was fun, and had good pacing. Plus it had great one liners. I don't understand where all the hate comes from. Yes there is some goofs, but unless you're really trying to find those you will enjoy this film. Be ready for the gore though.",Hellboy
669,danielfiodorov,🔥 Hellboring nonsense with CGI gore. 👿,4,11 April 2019,"No plot. No motivation. No goals. And even Hellboy is not a hero in this movie - he is just a bum, fighting there and there without a clear aims, struggles, or choices.Oh, the ""choice"" that he does in the end is so obvious, boring and disappointing, that feels like a spit in the face. The trailer of this film contains more structure than the movie itself.",Hellboy

671,cmchalex,A fun mess,6,12 April 2019,"The movie is by no means perfect but it was a lot of fun. After you get used to the new version and stop comparing it to Pearlman, it grows on you.

674,jpignaloso,We walked out,1,8 July 2019,"I had really high hopes for this iteration of Hellboy. But An hour into what is the worst film I've ever seen, we walked out. The plot was incoherent, the characters were flat, and the effects were cringeworthy. All of the fights and deaths were filled with pointless gore (like Punisher 2). I think the writers used cheesy one-liners, clichés, and lots of swearing because they couldn't come up with decent lines. When the unbearably gross satanic ritual showed up, we'd had enough. You'd have to pay me a whole lot to go through this one again.",Hellboy
675,rinormujaj,Bad movie nothing like the Hellboy we like,3,5 July 2019,This movie sadly didn't see it appropriate to have decent dialogues but invested in dad jokes (the ones which are not funny and make you cringe) and made them appear every 2 minutes.The cast was good but yet unable to go beyond the low limits the producers and writers have set for this movie.It is a 2 hour waste of time and don't bother to spend on it,Hellboy

678,dandez88,"""Hellboy"" watch it or skip it?",6,12 April 2019,"Hellboy is a reboot of the 2004 film with the same name. I have got to say, it wasn't great, but it wasn't bad. I probably wouldn't take kids to see it because although it looks obviously fake, there is a lot of gore in the movie. Think heads being cracked open, people being ripped apart. The film felt a little cheesy. The lines felt like I've heard them before in every other action comedy I have ever seen. Also, I noticed that the rock soundtrack sounded like they didn't leave any budget for some good sounding music.
The movie itself was fun. Lots of action scenes, some comedy that is funny at times and cringey at others. There wasn't much of a story though, and things felt like they were dragging along a bit. Also, I didn't really know the characters which didn't help me with trying to figure out what was going on, so I feel you need to maybe read up a little on the comics to be up to speed.
I really enjoyed the tone of the sets, whether it was the streets of Tijuana, dark, seedy and filled with neon accents. Or the hills of England, the movie did a great job with their sets. One thing I did not like was how fake some of the characters looked, it felt distracting at times. Hellboy looked pretty badass, so did some of the villains, but a lot of the no name characters looked like they were put together last minute by the special effects team.
My conclusion, this movie was not better than the 2004 original. The acting felt like people went over the top when trying to be cool and witty, the comedy was a mix of laugh out loud moments mixed in with I feel bad for them for trying that joke. The main characters looked cool, then the special effects budget ran out for everybody else. The action scenes were enjoyable, but there was no one great climactic moment. The story moved slow at times, and it was a little predictable.
So, should you watch it or skip it? I'm torn on this one. I'd say if you liked the original, watch it. If you don't care for Hellboy and you're expecting a great movie, SKIP IT! All in all, this just felt like a sloppy reuse of movie clichés. Even with all of these small flaws I thought it was a fun movie. Would I watch this again? No. Did I regret watching it? Kind of. If you enjoyed the 2004 movie, I would check this out just to judge for yourself. My Final Score: 6/10.
Don't forget to stick around for 2 End Credit Scenes. One happens midway through the credits which is pretty funny and worth sticking around for. The last one is at the end of the final credits which sets up a possible sequel. If you didn't like the movie much, then you can probably skip the 2nd End credits scene.",Hellboy
679,liensparks,DON'T BELIEVE ALL THE BAD CRITIC,6,8 July 2019,"If I would compare it to the first two Hellboy movies this is by far the second best and The Golden Army will be the first. The first Hellboy 2004 would be the worst. The first one was too much drama and totally anti-climactic for an obviously R-RATED DARK HORROR COMEDY source. It's Hellboy for crying out loud. The supposedly SON OF SATAN. Of course, it is R-Rated and grotesque! Keep that in mind in watching the movie. And this 2019 version actually delivered it. Sure there were some corny scenes like some Marvel movies but this movie delivered what was lacking in the first two movies by Del Toro which is the Gore! There were some errors in transformation but acceptable unless you want it to become an X-rated movie. If you want a moderately satisfying action-packed and gory Hellboy movie this can actually deliver! But if you want an explorative somewhat magical version then go for The Golden Army.",Hellboy

682,da15991,Ron Perlman did it better!,4,20 April 2020,"I'm not ragging on the cast, the filming crew, or anybody else who worked on the project, but the original Hellboy writers and Guillermo Del Toro did a lot better job. Ron Perlman and Guillermo Del Toro should've had another chance to do a proper Hellboy movie. Ron is Hellboy. The only reason I gave this movie four stars is because it falls in line with the comic book dramatics and costume design, more or less. The script was not all that great. The plot was very subpar.",Hellboy
683,wjanuszanis,Solid 8,8,10 July 2019,"To any people rating this movie with less than 6, please consider that 'Us' is still rated above 7.0 and it was the worst movie of the year :) so remove the bias and political correctness and maybe actually watch this movie before rating because titles like 'Hereditary' and 'Us' are rated way better and aren't even worth 1/10 ;)",Hellboy
684,Signe2005,"To be fair, I was NOT disappointed...",7,23 December 2020,"In my opinion, the acting was rather decent, costume/SFX makeup was perfection as usual. The only thing that bothered me was the story line. Don't get me wrong, the idea behind it was good, it was how it was told that was the problem.
More detail could'be been added; more on Hellboy's backstory about him being a descendant from King Arthur could've been more insightful.
Other than that, I did enjoy it and it did make me laugh!",Hellboy
685,adrianf2001,Sadly disappointing,4,8 March 2021,"This was a movie where if you looked away from the screen for 5 seconds to pass the popcorn to somebody, you missed 3 scenes. That's how uncomfortably fast paced this movie was, there was like 10 different things that happened throughout the movie and maybe only half of those scenarios were right where they belonged.
As far as action, the blood and gore seemed a bit gratuitous to the point that it was comparable to that of a DOOM game or a old school horror flick, it was cheesy to say nonetheless.
Since the movie moved so fast to cover a bunch of nonsense in its runtime of 121 minutes, every scene lacked a certain depth that could've made the film slightly better.
As a fan of Hellboy comics, I'd say this reboot of the original Hellboy movies gave us nothing to take home. I'd rather watch Ron Pearlman's Hellboy for the nostalgia, better flow and overall a better movie watching experience.",Hellboy

The story was a bit rushed, and contained quite a bit of GDT's vision, but I did like the R rated qualities of profanity and gore, that were missing from GDT's. The effects were great, and I could watch Mila Jovovich do math homework, and still be entertained, cause she just does it for me, so I have to say, I believe it was a good movie, and I hope there are more, but it is so shadowed by GDT's masterful works, I'm not sure if it'll pull through.",Hellboy
688,lat297,So much potential...,6,4 August 2019,"There's a lot to like here for Hellboy fans... from the very first line in the movie you know it's not for kids, with more swearing and gore than any comic book adaptation I've ever seen.Harbour does a very good job with Hellboy, and McShane is as good as ever in his role as the father. Fans of American Gods will feel right at home here.Unfortunately, Alice and the M11 cop are one of the biggest problems here; terrible (and I mean really terrible) English accents, which they try to mask just by overuse of classic British swear words, really let them down. A shame, when it's so unnecessary. But their real problem is a total lack of chemistry, bad acting, and awful dialogue. The scenes they share feel like they were lifted from a straight-to-cable Sci-Fi movie.Overall the movie is fun to watch, Milla Jovovich is awesome, and there's some really good action.Final point: if you're going to pretend you're filming in the New Forest, at least research what the New Forest bloody looks like first...",Hellboy

The first two films in this franchise were never going to take home Oscars either, so why anyone expected this one to be different is beyond me. I actually really like Deputy Chief Dadbod. It was the one part I was looking forward to, and that part I enjoyed.The cinematography and CGI, tho... Jeez.If those had been on point, I think people would have enjoyed it more, but the whole film was so... starkly daytime! No thought at all was put into the post-production to tone it back, deepen it up, and give it that feel of a dark graphic novel, which the first two films delivered in spades. This was like The Addams Family dressed in suburban ""Richard & Helen"" attire, driving a Chevy Malibu, living in a 3 bedroom ranch-style in a cookie-cutter subdivision.It was just... off.",Hellboy

I have no idea why it was felt this franchise needed a re-boot. Sloppy script with unnecessary swearing and weak supporting actors to David Harbour. The effects were good but not required for this film. Hellboy started life as a fun and exciting franchise which didn't feel the need for needless gore and guts. The new version of Hellboy looks like he's had a stroke with the lips of Herman Munster. Ian McShane, a legend also fails miserably in this film. A total bore fest which does not grow on the audience. All we can hope for is this new franchise dies quietly without any sequels so that it can be forgotten about.",Hellboy

I personally think the entire cast was great! The action and humor was fun to watch while the story seemed to have a few interesting elements to it which I also enjoyed!
There are only a few flaws that I wasn't a fan of, but nothing to bring it down to a horrible rating like some of the haters.
In my opinion, I loved Pearlmans mannerisms and humor as hellboy in the first films. And in this new hellboy with Harbour, I think he did just as amazing! I really can't pick a favorite as they are both spectacular as hellboy and in their own ways.

You can pick apart the CGI and complain of you want...I've seen worse and I've seen better. I like it that they used some practical makeup effects... The old school way. Still the best way in my opinion. For 2 hours of entertainment, I give it 8 stars because I had a good time. It won't win any awards, but who cares. I see films to be entertained, and that I was.

721,eclay-08172,Hellboy: Forever. Not the hell ride i hoped for.,5,15 August 2019,"I'm a little late to this party but oh well, still a fun time. Anyways folks, first off, I shall forever call this film, HELLBOY: Forever.That's what this film felt like to me. Felt like a batman forever just with demons and alot of blood. I'm not saying this film is bad at all. I actually had a fun time watching it.I won't go into too much detail, but this felt more of a dark-ish, over the top comic book world. Where del toros was, well, del toro. Serious, but excellent humor, effects, fighting, acting you name it. This one, it seems they wanted to crank it up to 11 and go nuts. I can enjoy that from time to time.The acting, like everything else was kinda campy, over the top and so on. They didn't want to be too serious.Now that i think about it, it also reminds me of the animated hellboy films from years ago.The practical effects when they were used were good. A few stinks here and there. The CGI,oh lord. very very few good shots. this was one of the last stops for the money flow.On that note, think that is one of this films biggest faults, their budget. you can tell this was a much lower budget then the others. Maybe if they would have had more they might have done better.Hope this review helps you make a choice on the film. Not near as good as the first two but still a fun one to watch here and there.PS. I enjoy Milla Jovovich no matter what. :-)I give Hellboy: Forever, i mean Hellboy(2019) a 5/10",Hellboy
722,josephbannister,Very underrated,10,26 August 2020,"To many people are comparing this to Guillermo del torro rendition, they are 2 completely different versions of hellboy. This is way closer to the original and true hellboys persona and abilities, David harbor nails it, and honestly I love this version way more it is so much more similar to what the true essence of hellboy is about, The gore , great CGI battles and shows the real darkness of what hellboy truly is about , don't compare renditions , if you watch this open minded you will enjoy it, i truly wish there will be a follow up",Hellboy

728,GovertOps,A small compensation for all the 1's,8,6 July 2019,"I really don't understand why it failed as hard as it did in box office. It's pretty much as silly as the old ones, only improved with blood and profanity, which doesn't necessarily hurt a blockbuster concerning hell, if you ask me. Quite the contrary.People giving it a 1/10 shouldn't be taken seriously, I don't believe any of those naysayers didn't see a movie that they thought was worse than this one. Of course there was a lot of nonsense going on and I'm sure there was also a healthy amount of plot holes; my 7/10 is however based on my own system in which I rate a movie on its boredom or entertainment value. And yes, that means in my book, the very slow classics that are so highly praised are sometimes scoring lower than this one. I gave Hellboy a 6/10 because I was not bored, plus an extra point for not being shy of a little butchery. I even thought some jokes were funny.I guess that you'll know how much my opinion means to you. If it's nothing, please still take the time to think about how much a movie would have to suck to give it a proper 1/10, and compare that with the absolute worst you've actually seen.",Hellboy

I'm not as hard on movies as I used to be but this one just falls flat like a soda that's been sitting out for a day or two. It's difficult to say just what exactly doesn't work but you feel like there were a lot of missed opportunities. The characters and actors themselves seemed fine but you don't really care what happens to them. So no real sense of danger or suspense. If anything, things felt very non threatening for everyone and you never really doubt that Hellboy will do the right thing in the end. Some of the settings and cgi look pretty good but others, like the giants, look ridiculous. Overall it was a poor attempt at a reboot that should have been a easy moneymaker.",Hellboy

With that in mind, i loved Guillermo Del Toro movies and i was expecting a 3rd one. Why you ask?
Well because they are better than this in every department, from visuals to actors and scrip.. now since i don't have any decent knowledge of the Comics i don't know how faithful they were and how much faithful this one is.This movie, in my opinion, is a big step back in quality in every department (again maybe it's more accurate regarding the original material but that is besides the point for me). The Main actor is a good choice but Ron Perlman was better; the visuals look like a mix from budget 90's movies with modern average CGI's (just take a good look at the HB prosthetics.... many of them look like cheap masks you can buy at a local store).
Del Toro version was an eye candy, especially the 2nd one. This one is just... almost bad to look at...The script.. well since i'm not really familiar with the source material i cant comment on that. The acting is ok.In short: I was expecting much but much better than this... Sure the budget is i little less than the 2nd Del Toro movie had but still... It was better to let Del Toro to make a 3rd one than giving us this.",Hellboy

Movie is great, definitely more gory than the previous ones. Creatures are visually impressive. Story might not be too cohesive but that can unexpectedly become part of the fun after being tired with all the pseudo-drama in other superhero franchises. Having no soapy love story is additional plus in my book.
Unless, of course, one attends all those CGI-filled movies expecting Citizen Kanes or such.All in all, a great trashy alternative to all the current mass-oriented superhero pulp.",Hellboy
735,theterroroutofplace,Pales into insignificance,5,31 May 2020,"There's actually some stuff to be enjoyed in this film (I particularly enjoyed the Baba Yaga scene) but it feels rushed, messy and lacking direction. The pace is all over the place and the character development takes a back seat. Expect constant exposition and an inability to care about most of the characters. Ian McShane is always great but the writing doesn't even allow him to shine.
I love violent, gorey films but the gratuity of the violence in some scenes during this film feel like they were done in post to push it up above a 15 certificate.
It's a shame we will never get to see what GDT could have done with a third film because that would have been a true passion project.",Hellboy

i was so dissapointed i almost left the cinema half way thru.
why reboot something and make it far worse then original just whyyy
horrible b grade acting,the plot was all over the place,it kind of felt like they tried to squeeze 10 hours of movies into one movie. the movie itself was closer top the comics which wasnt enough to make it good. Some of the cgi was great some was decent but the Hellboy itself came off as a whinning 10 year old. the humor you might like if you are beetween 10 and 20 years of age and if u like it and you are older then that i am shocked. Cheesy bad acted and with bad plot. if original hellboy has 6.9 this one should not have more then half of that. who ever rated this movie a 10 is a joke. Casino,godfather,heat,forrest gump,shawshank redemption etc are not rated 10 so it is ridicilous to rate this a 10.
it kind of reminded me of later resident evil sequels. imagine hellboy by gdt as resident evil 1 and this as resident evil 4 and you will get the idea about this movie. and to conclude it really hurts me to grade it this low but it was the highest i could go and be realistic. walking out of the cinema and all the way to home i was wondering how someone could make this and watch it and conclude that is ready to be released and call himself a director. a child would have done it better i think",Hellboy

Pointless movie, Hellboy was just making a fool outta himself and he wasn't funny at all. Hellboy that was suppose to be funny and interesting turn out to be very annoying.

This movie is an assault of jerky camera movements, terrible CGI, and terrible prosthetic makeup. Hellboy's makeup even effects how he's able to talk.
I literally don't care about any character in this movie. The Del Toro movies had a dynamic cast that worked well together and the movie took time to built characters and relationships. This movie basically says ""watch this big, ugly red guy smash stuff for 2 hours"".
The ""jokes"" in this movie seem like they were written by a board room full of 50 somethings trying to ""relate to them young folks"". References to busted phone screens and Hellboy asking ""is that my Uber?"" when a car pulls up to rescue him. Just made me roll my eyes.

749,robstemakin,Hellboy is soulless,4,19 April 2019,"I so wanted to like this movie. Its impossible not to compare this new take on the character with Guillermo del Toro's version and it is chalk and cheese. This version lacks the style, story, dialogue, character cohesion and class of the originals. While the visual effects are impressive in parts, Hellboy looks like he is made of candle wax. His horns even move in a scene where he is grinding them down. David Harbour himself does a good job, but the other characters are weak and poorly cast. The script is ridiculous even for a fantasy movie. It crams in to much in parts to establish the narrative of the scene, while lingering in other parts that have very little impact. Ian McShane is poor as Hellboys father. Hellboy's sidekicks are also pointless and have no chemistry with each other at all. The dialogue in the movie is truly awful. I have no problem with swearing, but it sticks out like Hellboy horns in this movie. It's misplaced and cheapens the script. The Scouse Pigman capped it all off for me. What where they thinking?",Hellboy

753,digitalsmithyuk,A balanced review for an ok film,6,2 January 2020,"There's a lot of angry people giving this 1/10. It's not that bad. A few give it 9/10, it's not that good. I'd say between 5-7 depending on what you like.
It's darker in tone, closer to the comics in its violence and profanity and has more of a b-movie feel than the BDT versions. With better execution I feel this would have made it a better film than the others. With a little script work HB would be an improvement over his sanitised BDT incarnation. It is let down in too many places for that - becoming a film best watched with friends who enjoy the b-movie schtick, and can laugh at the bad bits. While you won't be sending prizes, you probably won't begrudge the time watching it.
Some of the FX are very good, some are terrible - the ""giant fight"" is some of the worst CGI/choreography I've seen in years. Yet on balance there's enough to keep you going. Equally, some of the acting is very weak, but mainly it's good enough with the odd strong moment. The dialogue is predictable and basic.
It is fairly constant action, and little character, aside from some rather clunky expositional backstory. But it hangs together. It isn't incomprehensible as some reviews claim. The narrative is basic ""oh no, evil is rising"", and the hero sets off to fix it. In two places we snap forward rather abruptly - one where a journey takes place over the character telling HB where to go, the other on his return. It's a little jarring but the journey would have been dull and pointless to watch. There are one or two 'side-stories', which tie into the main narrative. But again, it's not a ""mash up of various tales"", it's easy enough to follow and coherent.
They clearly want a sequel, as it builds to that - which alas is where another weakness lies - as one of the main characters 'develops' in a horribly unconvincing way. They'll need plenty of acting and choreography training if there's ever a sequel.
I'd recommend being a bit squiffy or fairly bored - it's not a film you'll watch again, nor love I doubt - but it doesn't deserve all the hate.",Hellboy

You can tell the prop/costume department were really invested in this film, it's just a shame the writing staff weren't bringing their A-game.Unfortunately, Hellboy feels at least 30 minutes too long, its 2 hours runtime somehow feels much longer and I doubt I'd come back for a second viewing.It's nice to see some British locations and accents in a genre that is often confined to the States, but for whatever reason, half of the 'British' accents and mannerisms feel way over-done and telegraphed rather than spoken. (Though props for the Scouse pig-monster- that gave me a giggle)The film has little sense of space, time or motivation. Things just seem to happen because it looks cool, which is fine if you're just here for some fun visuals, but again, the 2 hours runtime is excessive.The monster designs are worth checking out- as an exercise in creative design and fancy visuals, this film is decent - but as a piece of storytelling, it falls too short.",Hellboy

The latter point in particular is where you really felt Del Toro's absence here.
Despite all this, David Harbour plays the character well and Mila Jovovich plays a genuinely menacing witch. I loved the previous movies and despite all the gnashing of teeth around the announcement of Harbour taking over from Perlman, I looked forward to seeing him take the reins and play a darker, more menacing looking Hellboy.

769,jeffwcrawford,They DC'd it.,5,13 April 2019,"The writers for Hellboy clearly haven't been paying attention to what DC keeps doing wrong. Like DC, they made some great casting choices, had fantastic visuals, and rushed as fast as possible through a lacklustre story rather than take the time to build a world.
There were at least two other movies that could have been made to set up this one. Instead, they mumbled their way through some important backstories just so they could explode as many colours on the screen as possible.
Too bad. A wasted use of a solid cast overall.",Hellboy

The effects were good, not great. It was quiet dark compared to the previous incarnation. Some of the kills were fairly goary so it earns its rating. I liked David Harbour but have to admit I prefer Pearlman. For anyone who hasnt seen director Neil Marshalls excellent Dog Soldiers a low budget werewolf thriller I strongly recommend it.",Hellboy
773,sketchharris,"Great Star, Gets Lost Somewhere.",5,14 July 2019,"There are some really entertaining elements in this film. So many spot-on adapations from the books that put a smile on my face. David Harbour looks amazing in this and his voice is great. But that's pretty much where it ends. The cast, amazing as they are, didn't seem to know what this was. I expected so much more from the names and faces that are on this cast list. Disappointing.As for story, it was all over the place. So many great moments that was terribly rushed and underdeveloped, they could have explored these environments and characters a lot more if this one movie was stretched out into a trilogy.That said, I feel like they should try again, right where they left off with this one. BUT as a limited series. Keep Harbour on the rest of the cast on tap to do 6 - 10 episodes in a ""villain-of-the-week"" type of thing with one on-going subplot. Supernatural, Lucifer, Buffy, Angel, and Stranger Things pulled it off.
Why not Hellboy?",Hellboy

Rather gory so be prepared if that's not your thing.I'm glad I gave it a chance instead of listening to those who are tearing it down without even seeing it.

775,zukowskipatryk,Don't listen to the hate and go watch this awesome flick,8,18 April 2019,"I honetsly have no idea how this movie can be so universally slammed. Hellboy has everything you need for a good action-oriented movie to be entertaining and avoids most things that make so many action-oriented movies boring and exhausting to watch, like bad characters, bad dialogue, forced jokes, badly told story. This Hellboy has it's style and it shows. This Hellboy know what it wants to be and it delivers just that. It's not a masterpiece and it has it's flaws (awkward editing for time to time and a few questionable music choices, plus a plot that has a little too much packed in it), but honestly? It doesn't matter when a movie delivers a ride so refreshing and unapologetic. Better not watch this movie if you don't like swearing or gore. Hellboy is obviously a movie that someone had clear vision for and I really respect that. In today's world when average movies or movies that we've seen a million times but in different clothes (I'm looking at you, Marvel) with soooo many forced jokes and bland characters gather so much praise I think that a little pearl like this is a welcome gift for people who want something different from movies. In a few years this movie will be seen as a misunderstanded gem and no one will know why people hated it so much.",Hellboy
776,alecdjackson,Great TV series pilot,8,14 August 2019,"I truly thought the film would be dreadful, given reviews. But, after watching it I saw the embryo of a terrific TV series, possibly something to put in the supernatural slot when that ends. Unlike the Del Toro movies, it isn't cinematic. Is this due to the director? Maybe, definitely hampered by a script that is so derivative it could have been stolen from a dozen other movies. Acting? Like the ensemble trio of main characters, the villain; boring and one dimensional. Hellboy trying to find a place where all worlds can live together, great, son of doodaa....who gives a toss! Alice, great character but not complete enough. Good attempt but should look better on the small screen.",Hellboy

I went ahead and did though luckily and it was absolutely amazing. I don't want to compare it to it's predecessors because it's so good in its own right; plot wise, quality acting, and the humor in a dark setting yet still maintaining a strong emotional quality. All of the actors more than excelled in their roles, the storyline was phenomenal, and the action was out of this world. The main difference between this and the others before it is that it earns the R rating with strong violence/gore, harsh language, and maybe being just overall more brutal in general but that doesn't make it bad. I would advise people on the fence about this who have seen the prior movies with Ron Perlman to go in expecting a different but equally rewarding type of experience, but this is strictly an adult film. In some ways, not holding back let's Hellboy excell even more. Ignore those cynical critics who probably didn't care about or like the first 2 either. Sit through the end of the credits for a cool little scene alluding to a sequel that I hope will be made.",Hellboy
783,slowen1205,Not as good as the original,6,16 April 2019,I was a bit sceptical about the new film as the original was really good and thought it was hard to top thatAs a stand alone film it's a decent action film but doesn't compare to the quality of the original film and the new actor playing Hellboy just didn't have the oomph as the original actor or the presence in my opinion and the pig character played by Steven graham wasn't the best as didn't really feel that the character added much apart from swearing ever other line and I love Stevens work,Hellboy
784,arcturus96,COULD BE BETTER,5,7 March 2020,"Worst part abour the movie was the story. Plot holes, repeating some stuff like we have a memory of a gold fish, forced dilemas in charachters etc. Writers should be beaten with clubs and left bleeding in the moonlight.

786,jimrug,Could have been so much better,3,11 July 2019,They couldn't just leave things alone like every other reboot. Pearlman nailed Hellboy years ago and this would have been so much better if they would have let him reprise the role. Even if they went with a new look it would have been better then this. They have a lot of great ideas in this move but it falls short basically cause it's not Ron.,Hellboy

So much one liners from Hellboy and even though many we're actually kinda funny, they feel weird. This does not feel like Hellboy in any way. And even though I usually love brutal movies, in this one, it too seemed weird. Everything about this movie seemed a bit off and weird. I watched this in ~20-30min rations and every time got bored and did not wan't to start again, but I did eventually finish it and in the end I'm still wondering why I didn't just quit after the first 30minutes. Not even Perlman could have saved this ship. I think this is what happens when someone ""important"" just wakes up and decides it's time to reboot a movie series but they don't have a script yet. Then someone starts smoking weed and writes this, probably in 12 hours straight. Only thing great about this movie is the fact that there will never be a ""sequal"".

At first I thought the bible thumpers were uniting, but that doesn't seam to be the case so now I'm left to wonder who these *bright intelligent beings* are so I can filter any review or opinion they may have to the recycle bin.I missed Doug Jones in this one as it's a reboot of sorts, but only after the movie was over as it held my attention for all the right reasons.

That being said, I always allow a film to stand on its own merit and did so with Hellboy 2019. David Harbour was a very good casting and carried the role of Hellboy on par with Ron Perlman of the previous films. The movie had great effects and characters but didn't seem to flow well as the plot was disjointed and seemed rushed in areas in establishing many of the plot points.

Something made me feel like the sets and costumes and so-so effects and yes, Lovejoy, were obscuring any passion or depth the actors could bring to the screen.

The lack of huge hype and high expectations tied to the project greatly increased the joy experienced after watching the movie. Its an absolute rollercoaster of emotions; great humor, magnificent musical accompanying the film is doomed to be an utter success. The creators of ""Hellboy"" proved that with great dedication and little finances you can create an eminent solution of horror and comedy. The balance between these two was admirable, the jokes thrown during a seemingly intense scene made the exact effect creators anticipated. Hellboy himself is the key to the movie's success, as the actor (David Harbour) described Hellboy is the perfect mix between Logan (wolverine) and Deadpool.

And I would definitely like to say thank you for the R rating.With the R rating, came some of the most brutal action shots and very well done cinematography whether CG or not. There is a numerous amount of creatures in the film and they all look superb. From the Momo-looking witch, to the Giants. It was very well done.The film itself felt more like watching a Doom game playout, just with a snarky speaking main character filled with angst. And it totally works for this film.

836,craigysyndrome,"Hellboy, making you wish you had picked something else to watch.",1,25 August 2019,"When I think of this movie I get the image of the story writers, editor, and the director being thrown in a dumpster and kicked down 60 flights of stairs while trying to put this movie together. The acting was pretty flat, it felt like none of the actors had any chemistry with each other, each character came across one dimensional, not to mention that there was a few characters that were basically turned into throw away characters. The film relies on quite a heavy amount of CGI, unfortunately, the CGI is pretty terrible for a movie that's aiming to be a Blockbuster. In short, this movie is fairly terrible right across the board. I recommend watching this movie when it comes out on tv for free in the background while you're doing something else.",Hellboy

841,nath-92208,Should have been Hellboy III instead...,1,31 March 2020,"The original Hellboy is one of my all time favourite movies and I loved the sequel too, so when I heard that it was getting rebooted and then David Harbour was cast, and then I saw him in the makeup, and I heard it would be rated R I was freaking out! And then I caught it on Amazon Prime...*sigh*. I'm not really sure what happened here, I've heard good things about Neil Marshall, David Harbour is a great actor and can definitely portray the sassy, sarcastic attitiude of Hellboy and on top of all that the storyline is ripped right out of the comics and it's a great story! But this is just horrible, the script is ATROCIOUS, the acting is mediocre at best, the plot is jumbled and the whole Baba Yaga thing is the most tacked on character/subplot I've EVER seen! Sadly something that could have been amazing turned out to be yet another crappy 2010s reboot of a great movie (that didn't even need to be made, the producers were just too stubborn to let Guillermo do his own thing, if they had been more leniant then we could've had Ron Perlman back too for an awesome and long overdue Hellboy III) that will go down in history as probably my least favourite movie ever.P.S: I know some people love this movie and see it as just a fun, silly, dumb action movie but I just can't get over how dumb it is (and I even liked Bad Boys II). I also know that some people think that a lot of reviewers are way too harsh with their 1/10 ratings but that's just honestly how I feel about it and I apologize if you liked it and are offended by review and opinions.",Hellboy
842,brickmanjelg,I get the comics were gory but...,2,27 January 2020,"First I want to start off by mentioning the good things in the movie.
David Harbour did a great job as Hellboy and the makeup was really solid.
The rest of the cast did ok. Wasn't terrible, but nothing good or memorable either.
All the bad things however
The story is jumbled, and the tone is inconsistent. It doesn't know if it wants to be a horror movie or a superhero movie. The script is also pretty bad, with numerous unnecessary swearing. For an example, read the first line of the film. Finally, there's the gore.
Goodness, the amount of gore in this film.
For me, the biggest problem with the story is that it uses gore continuously to tell it, and it's constantly in your face. One of the deleted scenes explained Nimue's origins, but looking at the runtime, the filmmakers clearly thought, ""Nah, we can't have this. We need more jaws getting ripped off and people getting skinned alive and having their corpses sliced in half vertically."" There was so much gore, that 3 times, I looked away from the TV and waited for the screaming to stop.
If you hate gore, or only like it if there's not too much, skip this film.",Hellboy
843,mockstarsky,Was his necessary?,1,1 July 2020,"How on earth can a movie from 2019 look worse than a movie from 2004? The CGI is just absurdly bad, low budget piece of c-word.

One star goes to the Baba Yaga scene, the only part of the movie that at least tries to live up to Del Toro's work.",Hellboy
844,tao-58694,"Lots of great individual moments, poor overarching film",6,28 February 2021,"I do think that a lot of reviews were a bit unfair to this movie. While definitely not as good as I'd like it to be, it's also not a blight upon humanity like so many reviews led me to believe. On the positive side, it's definitely an entertaining movie. While the hardcore gore and constant cursing turned some people off, I found it to be more faithful to the world of Hellboy than the tamer del Toro movies (It's a movie about a half-demon fighting creatures from Hell; yeah, it's gonna get graphic). David Harbour is great in the lead role, nailing the few character scene this movie gives him while being consistently entertaining and just fun to watch throughout. The monster designs are very creative and unique, especially the demon designs during the London assault scene near the end. It was just disappointing they weren't utilized more. The fight scenes are overall very enjoyable, generally considering of quick and brutal action without utilizing the infamous MCU approach of cutting way too quickly to actually keep track of what's going on.Unfortunately, there are a lot of very valid criticisms of this movie. It goes way too fast, trying to cram in so many pieces of the comic lore into way too short a timeframe. If you're not familiar with the source material, good luck keeping up. The movie presents a lot of interesting themes, but due to how unbelievably overstuffed it is none of the topics (or any other aspect of the movie) is given enough time to be explored or develop. It's more a mishmash of great individual ideas that are swept away before their potential can be even somewhat fulfilled. The CGI, while not egregiously terrible, usually ranges from adequate to sub-par. I was rarely distracted by blatant VFX shots, but I don't recommend looking too closely either. Outside of Harbour, I found the acting to be pretty mediocre overall, though I think that's more due to the blistering pace not giving the characters any real time in the spotlight than the talent involved. The direction and shot composition is similar to the CGI. It's passable, but nothing amazing.Overall, this is a movie that you need to get on board with to enjoy. The bottom line is that there's just too much going on to give this movie the slightest chance to tell a compelling narrative. However, taking each scene at face value reveals a lot of great individual moments that should keep you entertained until the end.",Hellboy
845,andrew-butler210,Don't expect anything special,4,21 April 2019,"I watched this movie with an open mind but was left disappointed, not because it's the reboot and I was upset with the cast change, but because the directing and acting was incredibly poor.
What made this more frustrating was that they had a good script and ideas, but the excitation just kept coming up short.Poor English accent, no chemistry between any of the actor's, almost like no one knew which way the movie was meant to go, was it Cheese? Serious? Gripping? Comedy? It was like watching a movie that changed directors every scene.I really wanted this to work but your gotta get a better director and commit to a direction and cut out the poor scrip choices with bad language to try and get a laugh.Really had a massive opportunity to make something special.Easy guide for next movie.

I just feel the chemistry like the humour and the writing just falls flat for me. Prosthetic makeup, production design and SFX are decent, there's plenty of action and gore, but it just feels empty.
It's very hard not to compare it against the Guillermo Del Toro films which were brilliant with Ron Perlman as Hellboy. Del Toro's unique visual style, production design and story telling are his character troupe as director. Add the chemistry between the actors like Selma Blair and Ron Perlman. I really wish they continued with the trilogy instead.
I do like David Harbour from Stranger Things as Hellboy. He would have been a good replacement for Ron Perlman, if the writing had offered anything new or interesting to his character that we hadn't seen before.
SPOILER: The main story arc of HellBoy comic book series builds up to the fact that he is prophesized to bring about the End of the World. But we end up seeing what that would essentially look like in this film for a whole finale sequence. Kind of takes away the engagement or anticipation for further sequels.Once again the writing and the pacing of the film just doesn't engage the audience.

David Harbour was great as Hellboy, looked and acted well in the role. The plot was interesting enough with interesting characters thrown in and some twists I didn't see coming.
This movie is very R rated and I would say that is my main complaint. I'm not new to gory films, but some of the scenes in this movie made me uncomfortable.

Hellboy and the other misfits were a fun little group to watch, but were predictable. It is what it sets out to be, which is an anxty teenager running around aolvong problems with his/fists. I just think it could have been more too.Personally liked Mila Jo who was amazing, but her characters feel apart with her 'marry the hellboy' scheme, I feel like for someone who could survive this long she would be smarter and more cunning.Baba yaga was interesting, but never came to fruition, and all she wanted was his eye.The pig boy's motives felt weak and he was lined up as tragic character and could have had a better death.I didn't feel like there were any real stakes, with hell boy making this choice, as if we ever would think he would turn and be this evil killing machine demigod for evil in the first movie. Honestly I wish they did pull the trigger on that arch. They keep making this fuss that things that seem evil aren't necessarily so and they could have made him a benevolent end to the war. He has the heart of a human with the power of a demon and the demon side will always win... Why? Why not change the narrative. Make it interesting.",Hellboy

I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the first two with Ron Perlman. I actually thought the first two movies were great movies. This one carried more about jumping all over the place telling, what felt like, several different stories. There were many santanic undertones throughout the movie that were completely unnecessary. I felt that the movie had great potential and completely dropped the ball and kicked it over the neighbors fence. This movie not only felt that they needed to retell the original story, kind of, but also added a bunch of other stories into the movie.There were a few good parts such as the giants fight scene and.... well that was about the best part. Do yourself a favor and watch the old Hellboy movies in 4K.

864,mehrbod22,Unfortunate movie,4,10 July 2019,"To compare with previous movies , this movie was an step back. problem is with structure of movie. Story is good but produce is very weak. Here are some example:
The aduncess already know the story about how hellboy came to this world. There was no need to recreate the old scenery.story could be simply the continues of old movies.
In one scenery ,for few seconds I lost the story line. When hellboy was in the cave with Merlin and he took the scaliber sowrd , suddenly movie jumps to a scene of hell with hellboy flying back a dragon.
No previous warning, no showing that this is actually the visions of hellboy. I thought the movie jumped to the an other scene by error!! The witch whom betrayed to the blood queen, when the blood queen resso Resurrected and didn't kill her ; she said I have other plans for you or something like it. But in continue nothing happened. Simply this character in the beginning of the movie and this scene didn't had any roll.
The cret creatures that came out of hell in London, the director could emphasised the features. The first creature that came out of hell, I had to repeat the scene several times to understand it's right hand is something like an executioning instrument.!!

879,seblivingston,Not The Worst Film I've Seen,5,30 November 2019,"Not the worst film I've seenI must preclude this review by saying that I am very partial to the del Toro duology, but I feel I have been very fair and non-discriminate against the new lead actor - David Harbour - and the new director.The movie runs a bit slow as I found myself pausing more often than I typically do - for me personally this is indicative of a flick being slightly boring or not catching my attention completely. It picks up the pace about half way through.David Harbour plays Hellboy fairly (not as naturally as Perlman, but likeable nonetheless) and had me chuckling quite a few times throughout the two hours. In fact, I noticed an abundance of comedic implants that gave the film a boost. This was a noticeable contrast to the darker, anger-laced portrayals which created a predominant dualism in his character.The script is written in a way that it's hurried and presumptively and suffers because of it. I think overall the plot is very cliche and a go-to of sorts for superhero films. In that respect it scores very average, hence my rating of a 5 out of 10.Hellboy's father and the scenes involving him were bland, I think a more unique actor could have been the missing element in that regard.Milla Jovovich seemed decent enough as the hellbent witch; nothing compared to say Cara Delevigne's performance in Suicide Squad. Nevertheless, Jovovich is sexy enough for me to close up shop on the B.P.R.D. and explore being king while we're ravaged the Earth.The manner in which Hellboy's immaturity was portrayed seemed annoying, Perlman nailed that aspect of the red demon's personality whereas Harbour had trouble blending it into his overall persona.Spoiler: I suppose Baba Yaga will get revenge in the sequel, judging by how the film ended - I was really anticipating the closing of that encounter as the makeup/costume and acting made Yaga a demonically delectable addition to the various caricatures.Spoiler: Abe Sapien! It's obvious his discovery and membership to the B.P.R.D. will be part of the sequel. Curious to see who they will cast, hard to compete with Doug Jones.In closing I feel comfortable with a sequel, Harbour acts well and for all intents and purposes fulfills the classic image of Hellboy. Sasha Lane is a fantastic addition as well and deserves a place in the next film.",Hellboy

890,JahnSenpai,"Fun Action flick, nothing more",6,27 April 2020,"The action scenes are pretty fun to watch.
David Harbour delivers a good Hellboy.These are the only good 2 Things. The Story is a total Mess and sometimes way to over the top.
Hellboy (2019) tries to tell as many Storys as possible, but dont even get one right. There are soooo many Characters in this Movie, some of them are really important Characters in the Comics, but no on of them gets a real Backstory or even a real motive why they are doing these things in the Movie.
The Characters are flat like a sheet of paper.But the worst one of them all, is the Main Villain played by Mila Jovovich.
She acts like a Stone, has maybe 12 minutes of screen Time, lame Backstory, No Character at all. She is the most uninteressting Element of the movie, sometimes i totally forgot about her.All this combined with CGI that looks so bad u cant even tell whats going on there.
The CGI is really Horrible and embarrassing for the year 2019But the action is still cool",Hellboy
891,philpembentino,Unfairly slammed and not given a chance. An actual accurate adaptation from Mignola's comics.,10,12 April 2019,Just because Del Toro isnt directing and Hellboy isnt Perlman doesnt mean this film should be getting slammed unfairly the way it is. it's a new vision and adaptation that actually works even better as far as following comic source material. The action and pacing is intense and the horror aspects are really well blended. People keep slandering the cgi and honestly its excellent cgi. The story blends many different particular comics together and it works. David Harbor gives a lot of great character to hellboy as well. Just see this and pay no mind to delusional biased critics and haters. It's a fun adaptation.,Hellboy

893,Chudderz,Swearing doesn't make an adult version work!!!,5,16 April 2019,So I went with an open mind as having watched the previous Hellboy movies I wasn't sure what this would be. The word was it was a more raw version of the film so I thought I'd give it a go. I have to say I came out feeling a little let down and wondering why they bothered? Yes it was a romp but it seemed that the producer wanted more swear words in to make it adult? Don't get me started on Gruagach's vocabulary!!!!!!The general story was a bit rushed and didn't make sense at times but given a lot went on that is fair enough I suppose. David Harbour did a decent job as Hellboy even though some of his lines were hard to hear but the rest of the cast were a let-down. Milla Jovovich seemed bored by it all and was a little lame as a baddie whilst Sasha Lane seemed totally miss cast. The least said about Daniel Dae Kim's accent and acting the better as far as I was concerned.Far enough making a edgier reboot but go for it don't just have swear words and CGI of bodies being ripped up to make it that. All in all I was disappointed with what could have been a good idea. If there is a follow up then I suggest they go for it and do it for adults instead of a half baked idea as this.,Hellboy

895,lemmon,Uneeded Reboot - why bother?,4,17 August 2019,"Too brutal and too bloody for my expectations. The reboot was bad, and imho unnecessary. Both the older del Toro-movies where better, although I must admit as a German even there I could do without the Nazi-theme, but the steampunk-feeling was a nice touch and well done in that movies - not so, here.This new one had a bland, bad script, way too much darkness and no interesting sidekicks, I really liked the group in the del Toro-movies. Hellboy was ok, but his jokes did not really jibe with the rest of the movie. And with the scenes pointing to the next movie, I fear we will get more of this boring drivel - not that I will force myself to watch that.One of a lot of reboots (like Spiderman Homecoming/far from home etc.) I could do without, pre-ordered this on iTunes as I thought it would be better, but the trailer should have warned me. Will seriously think about cancelleing other pre-orders or not ordering some.",Hellboy
896,Stevenrates,Somewhat okay actually.,6,13 April 2019,"I can't fault David Harbour for his performance. He did a splendid job portraying Hellboy. He even shined with a mediocre script. I prefer Harbour's Hellboy over Perlman's for sure. They pulled off the look on Hellboy too. Loved the scruffiness.The storytelling and scripting weren't great though. I was still entertained throughout the entire movie however. Lots of solid action, and despite the lackluster script, the humor was for the most part on point as well and the R rating really shined through with lots of gore.As for the acting, as mentioned, Harbour did an excellent job whereas the rest of the cast performed at a supbar level. Especially Milla Jovotich delivered a not so convincing portrayal of Nimue The Blood Queen.
The poorly written script with lots of questionable dialog didn't help much either.Also wish they had toned down the character Gruagach a bit. Given him less screen time perhaps. He just really wasn't a very convincing character with a less convincing agenda.I felt the movie worked well creating the scene for a Hellboy franchise. A dark and gritty world with lots of potential. But I do hope for massive improvements in a potential sequel. Better storytelling and hopefully a much more solid cast helped along with a script that justifies the actors and actresses.To sum it all up. I had hoped for more but was entertained throughout the film.",Hellboy
897,TarantinosTeacher,Surprisingly good,8,12 April 2019,"I did not have much expectations going into this film, but god I was so pleasantly surprised with the quality of the movie. First and foremost, the soundtrack and music used in the film was outstanding and really set-up the movies atmosphere. The acting was good, and the director did a tremendous job to integrate the great humor, and by it, make Hellboys even more interesting. The character was very well written off, the relationships with all the other characters were well-written and interesting, the plot was good and the antagonist had a clear motive for her doings. The movie overall was very entertaining and funny, although an important note would be that it includes a lot of graphic content. Surely recommended!",Hellboy

I am very disappointed with how this movie turned out, it's alot of random action scenes cut in with a mess of a story.

F no. You saw its rated R, you saw harbour looks awesome as hellboy, and you saw tons of gory action scenes. You will get EXACTLY what you expect. Cgi is great 95% of the movie. Blood looks awesome, camera doesnt shy away from anything(and boy do i mean anything), problem is, dialogue is sometimes shallow and amateurish, plus the cliched end of the world scenes and ramblings of the evil witch. Also the plot doesnt transition smoothly but rather jumps from point to point. But your probably not gonna mind at all if you just come into the cinema with proper expectations. If you want del toro's hellboy stay home and dont be a salty hater..

The action is pretty lame, it all feels too rushed, apparently the director had a hard time on this film thanks to the studio being a pain so I can see why the film is in this state.

I just wanted something silly, entertaining and over the top, and the exactly what I got, and I must say, I enjoyed the..erm..hell out of it.
Directed by Neil Marshal, who has worked on Game of thrones and West World, this is not the Neil Marshall who gave us the horror masterpiece that is The Decent.
This is the Neil Marshal who gave us Dog Soldiers and Doomsday.
Silly, gory, surprising and does not give a **** about embracing it absurd concept to the full. David Harbor knocks it out of the park as Hellboy, and one thing he has over Ron Perlman's performance is a sense of threat; that he really could be evil of pushed too far.
The whole film moves at a fast pace and has a feel of a video game, but here it works, with a mix of Devil May Cry and God of War, especially in the combat and design of some creatures.
Maybe I was in a forgiving mood but the Bebop like villain Gruagach had me in stiches with his sweary mouth and English northern accent.

I was expecting they would reboot the franchise because they had some new ideas. Doesn't seem like that was their motivation. The 2019 version is a mess. The source material is SO rich, but they only skimmed the surface of it, focusing on broad ideas so much that I couldn't really care about any of the characters or even the fate of humanity. The writing is bad and feels like a Jr. High boy's creative writing assignment, full of fantastic concepts that have all been done before. There's a lot of explaining about past events and scene setup that should come from situations and dialog, but instead is given to us in a ""Oh yeah, forgot to tell you..."" fashion. Then there was the editing... Scenes were mishmashed together to tell the story loosely. I'm not an editor, but I even noticed scenes that would have been better left out or rearranged in a different order. Halfway through the movie, I left.",Hellboy

Even with a good cast (Milla!!) this movie is shoddily written, disjointed, lacking in wit or any genuine character development, weirdly bad CGI, and a huge let down. And it just isn't Hellboy. Im very confused with all the cast /media comments that it's meant to be different from Del Toro's films, truer to the comics, and darker..... It copied SO MUCH from the 2004 film, but not in a good way. And I feel that Del Toros films were actually much more of a darker, monster-movie tone than this reboot (despite the R rating).

948,adriel-224-856180,The pacing is what killed the movie.,5,12 April 2019,"Just came out of the theatre and I left feeling a bit sour. I was looking forward to this film because I enjoyed the first two and the Hellboy comics I have read but didn't have super high expectations going in based on the horribly done first trailer. Being a film editor myself I don't understand how some trailers are done so poorly..and then marketed anyhow..as far as the actual movie, the pacing of the movie is at rapid speed and has way too much information and characters and heavy action, loud music all at once literally back to back throughout the entire film. Actors did what they could with the he script I'm sure which includes the lead and supporting. I wasn't too thrilled with most of the dialogue and that ""MY BAD"" joke was the worst cringe. The CGI was pretty good but still left me feeling like it wasn't finished, I expected it when I saw LG was the distributor. Sure it kept to a lot of the source material but it was just all over the place especially if this franchise wanted to reach new fans. I don't care about Rotten Tomatoes at all and the rating is a little TOO low their but they're not too far off.",Hellboy

953,tleaf-00150,A trainwreck of a reboot that gets it wrong on every level,3,12 April 2019,"I don't know where to begin. This film wants to set itself apart from Del Toro's movies, which is fine but it starts with the same style of exposition dump that Del Toro's films do and it just goes downhill from there. The source material they draw from is handled in ways that simply don't work. The Wild Hunt forms the core of the film, which is fine, but they're using a story where HB has walked away from the BPRD and Professor Broom has been dead for over ten years...but clearly that isn't what they're doing here...which is fine. But we begin with Hellboy in Mexico and why this story is the starting point of this film is simply so we can have an opening fight scene. But there's a villain from the Wild Hunt that could have served so much better in this role and he's not in the film which is a missed opportunity. We get exposition dump after exposition dump in between fight scenes that exhibit really cheap CGI laden with extraneous gore and out of context curse words with silly moments that don't fit and really awkwardly placed humor.Overall none of this movie works. Ian McShane and David Harbour have no on screen chemistry and McShane's version of Broom simply isn't Broom. The nature of their father-son relationship and their conflict is so jarring and uncomfortable because as far as the new viewer is concerned, they've always resented each other. Meanwhile David Harbour feels like he is just doing a poor impression of Ron Perlamn rather than make Hellboy his own let alone try to embody the actual character.Overall I can't express how much this movie fails to do what it set out to achieve. It isn't even exciting or at least dumb fun. It's plodding and despite the violence and gore it isn't exciting or enthralling. The actors don't serve the characters at all and the writing doesn't help the actors at all and it is clear that whatever Neil Marshall set out to create, the studio hacked apart in the editing suite, but even still i am not convinced that Marshall really had a clear idea of who Hellboy is and what made the comicbooks so cool. The movie is lacking in mood and its tone is hyper as opposed to the subdued and creepy and strange and weird tone of the comics.They set up a sequel...that i hope doesn't get made because as bad as this is, i can only imagine it getting worse in the hands of this production crew.",Hellboy

I've been a big fan of Del Toro's version of hell boy and for that reason was skeptical when this came out. Was it a disappointment? Absolutely Not!!It was definitely a different take compared to the previous movies but was enjoyable none the less. David harbour was perfect for this role. The movie was entertaining from beginning to end. It was dark with subtle humour. Infact, I found it to be darker than the original (which I thought was exactly what a hell boy movie should be like) I would strongly recommend this movie. Just watch it with an open mind. Take it as a stand alone movie rather than comparing it to the previous version.",Hellboy

It is a bet for sure money cow as many people will head up to cinemas to see it since Hellboy was always funny, action and bit darker superheroes franchiese.For me it is a solid 5 star from 10 movie, do not like that in this one is Hellboy wimpy not sure of him self person who constantly get beaten and several times easily prey to kill.

Plot - felt like the pieces of the story that would give some sense of continuity were lost on the cutting room floor when the editors just gave up entirely after they realised what a lost cause this was
Acting - ok Ian Mcshane and Daniel harbour are watchable, everyone elses accents were laughableThis film made me feel like someone had crossed scooby doo, monty python and the evil dead, stirred them all up in a pot, took a massive s*** on the lot, then left it out in the sun until the stink reached maturitySeriously how does something so bad get produced these days?This character and storyline has so much potential and THIS is what they came up with?!Do not bother paying to watch this film, dont even wait until it's free...

This isn't the bad part though, sorry to the producer/s and the director/s, but you must be out of your head for making it horribly gory and gruesome: there was seriously no need.

So I was super excited when this was announced and the first stills and the casting of Dave Harbour seemed spot on.But for some reason, I wasn't pulled into the cinemas after the initial negative backlash. I waited until it streamed on Netflix and started watching it. Started is the right word, because I have found myself struggling to finish it. The CGI is horrendous, the lighting seems too bright and colorful at times, the dialogue is poor, the acting is stale and don't get me started on those atrocious ""British"" accents!I am sad, because this will inevitably kill the franchise for the foreseeable future.

Having him be a Teen/Young adult was a cool touch and I loved the rough edginess to him. I actually prefer this design over the original. I do think, however, the plot was all over the place. Ron Perlman's Hellboy movies were cohesive, fluid and very easy to follow along. I did get lost quite a few times and many moments were filler garbage. I defintely would watch again.

It's an action-packed splatter/gore-fest. Is it ridiculous in parts? Yes. Is it corny in parts? Also, yes. It's a H E L L B O Y movie. You don't go into a Godzilla movie looking for Oscar nominated writing and acting. You go for monsters and action. The same could be said for Hellboy 2019. It's just a fun action movie. There are some pretty good one liners. The scenery and creature design are great. If all your Hellboy knowledge comes from Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy 1 and 2, you might want to skip this one. If you're a fan of the comics and enjoy a bit of ultra-violence, give it a shot. I thought David Harbour's portrayal was great and true to the source material. My biggest gripe is that the CGI could've been better during certain scenes. Rent it, wait for it to be streaming on whatever you stream with. They leave it open for a sequel and I'm fine with that.

Well the movie isn't as bad as the critics are saying, but it's still pretty bad.First off this movie was bound to be messy, after all the reports of tension behind the scenes. And it's evident through the lazy storytelling and poor cgi. Several instances just felt like they couldn't be bothered to explain things: for example characters just jump locations without any explanation of how they got there. Just add in some voiceover and characters go from being in the city to some island in the middle of the ocean in a second. Hellboy at one point gets impaled and electrocuted multiple times, and still somehow manages to fight off three giants with perfect ease in the very next instance. The movie also tries to integrate too many plot lines: the blood queen's scheme, Baba Yaga scheme, Hellboy working for the BPRD, the whole King Arthur Merlin debacle and the pig monster. Add in the overload of gore and curse words and you get a bloated mess. The climax also uses the cliché of the hero almost turning to the dark side but returning to his old self in the last moment. I mean that's literally the ending of the original Hellboy!There are some positives however. David Harbour's performance as well as the look of evil Hellboy. The song choices although out of place, still manage to save the movie in my opinion.Oh and about the cgi, it's as bad as cgi can get for Hollywood blockbusters in today's time. From green screen mess in the troll sequence, to pasting Ian Mcshane's face onto a slime apparition, it was almost laughable. The creature designs didn't help either.Just rewatch Guillermo's version.

The best about this movie is the mix of mythology, our reality and technology, of course a Hellboy movie isn't a Hellboy movie without sarcastic humor.
The movie bring some discussions like:
The destiny of Hellboy is do bad things but he do good things for option.
which one is the best way to raise a child
The acting of Hellboy (2019)
David Harbour as Hellboy: The makeup doesn't disturb the charisma very good acting combine perfectly with the character.
Danial Dae Kim as Major Ben: So so sometimes he tries to be serious but sometimes he does a bad joke
Sasha Lane as Alice: Very charismatic

But Neil Marshall's latest has blood, but you don't care about any of the characters so it's just CGI red splashes. The story barrels along apace, and the actors all turn up and do a good job (and some entertaining British accents and all that) but it's a total no mark of a movie.

I was skeptical going into this movie because of all of the harsh reviews floating around online. Afterwards, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and so did my boyfriend.
Cons:
The plot was very busy. There was a lot going on and wasn't *particularly* strong- BUT, I was never lost or confused during the movie like some others said. If it were me, I would have cut some of the side plots. Not a huge issue, but noticeable.
The dialogue. The villain dialogue needed some serious work. It seemed like the writers were trying too hard to create some deep, emotional, evil character by giving them brooding and emotion-packed dialogue. This was my biggest issue with the movie. Especially Milla Jovovich's character. She's a great actress, I've seen her in a lot, but the dialogue made her performance less than what I think she is capable of. Some people say the acting was bad, but I think it was just the dialogue writing.
Pros:
David Harbour was excellent as Hellboy. No complaints there whatsoever.
There was a LOT of practical special effects. They did really stunning SFX makeup on many of the monsters/Hellboy himself. I really appreciated this! It made it more realistic to me, and I can appreciate the hard physical work that went into it.
There was a TON of gore. I mean, a TON. I find gore entertaining in movies, so I suppose this could be a con for some people. I enjoyed it and it made for some very visually entertaining scenes.
Hellboy's co-stars were people of color. Loved it.
The soundtrack was great and fit well with the movie.
While the pace was a bit fast, the actual length of the movie wasn't too long either.

During the funny scenes, I exhaled a little, sometimes. Some moments were designed to disgust the audience, and those succeeded spectacularly.
The movie was badly written, the soundtrack was horribly out of place, there was little to no character development. It seems like they wanted to include a number of monsters even if there was no connection to the story. They basically stuffed as many things in the movie as they could and confused everyone, including the ones on screen.

I sat down to watch how the film was going to pan out post marvel era and boy was I disappointed. Hellboy character wasn't too bad but the supporting cast of plumy accented English people. I'm from the UK which has a wealth of accents even in London there is a huge variation of them, so why does everyone in this film sound like the come from royalty. Even the girl who grew up in various low rent flats sounded like she had been through the My Fair Lady treatment. Hollywood needs to learn that not everyone in the UK sounds like that just the same as everyone in the US doesn't sound like a cowboy. The plot and dialog were also really bad but for me the accents of my fellow homies was the most annoying part of this movie.",Hellboy
1002,brynnpstevens,"Great action, terrible accents.",6,17 June 2019,"While I thoroughly enjoy carnage, decapitation and the odd witch snog, Hellboy was a tad predictable but I did enjoy the senseless violence.
There were some terrible English accents from blatantly American actors which did make me want to vomit up my tea and scones.
David Harbour is a good Hellboy and the storyline wasn't as cheesy as the original films but as a fan of the comics, I do feel it sucked King Kong balls at the end.",Hellboy

Wasted 1hr of my life, what on Earth was the crew/director/actors watching back because it must have been something different to me as I'm sure no one would ever allow that to go public....how to ruin a franchise.

1005,meloraw,Think Cooper and Crue not The Doors,7,27 July 2019,"This was more Hellboy, emphasis on Hell. While I loved GDT's films, they were lighter than this one, as in milk and cookies lighter. That's great.
This version was more dark ages and the monsters were really scary. The editing in this one could've cut the Nazis and kept Mila Jovovich's big entrance scene in full. The monologue that replaced it was lusterless. And I really liked GDT's Nazi-Hellboy Origin scenes so much better.
Hats off to the cast, their characters were fun and different. I didn't believe anyone could do what Ron Perlman did, but David Harbour did an outstanding job. Mila Jovovich has a striking departure from her Resident Evil persona but shows that she has room to do more than just action movies. I always love Daniel Dae Kim and his surprise was a pleasant surprise.
Moral of the story: Get the DVD (for Mila's intro) and watch it as a droll Hellboy horror movie and not a fun PG13 fantasy movie.",Hellboy

Super glad I did, because that put the entire thing into perspective for me, because I had no idea why they were making another Hellboy.
I LOVED this new Hellboy, way better than the previous movies, I am a Ron Pearlman fan, and Del Toro is cool. BUT THIS was a STUNNING MASTERPIECE.
NOT to be missed.
I felt compelled to write a quick review because I saw so many others trashing it, I'm like WTF, that movie was awesome, I saw it at the theater when it came out and I loved it.
BUT, you must forget all you know about Hellboy, and go into this with a fresh slate. This isn't a reboot or remake or prequel or any of that. THIS is an entirely new movie, made how it should've been from the beginning.

I'm in for the humour and just a great time really. I haven't watched the previous versions, but I gotta confess this one works for me. At the end of the day, critics will always have something to say and yes they are entitled to their opinions but I would urge anyone who hasn't yet seen this movie to give it a chance. We are in an era where it is very easy to be persuaded by popularity, ratings and negative reviews, but at the end of the day if no one else liked it, at least I did!",Hellboy

But the fight scenes were actually pretty fun to watch, David does well as playing His role as Hellboy, and the language/gore and violence fits the movie, after all this is about demons trying to bring hell to earth, now the cgi isn't very great, if you are watching in 4K UHD there are scenes that it compliments the movie, and then other scenes where it just looks very very poor.

To be honest, this was better than I expected. Although I do prefer the original two Hellboy movies, this one was still enjoyable.

This one is more into horror than rhe fantasy we expected.
The acting of harbour is so shallow, the alice character is silly, damio is just a cliche.
Mila jovovich and ian made a bad choice joining this.
Music just a mess
The makeup and costumes arw good, despite hellboy himself with a very weird and ugly set up. Not even comparable to the old hellboy 15 years before this film !

Reviews came out quickly of how bad it was and I didn't rush to watch it. Over a year after it's release finally got around to watching it. And to my surprise it really wasn't as bad as majority of the reviews I've read. Is it amazing ? Absolutely not but David Harbour does a compelling interpretation of Hell Boy. Solid supporting cast, flow, soundtrack and directing. Weakest part is they over complicated the story, went in to many directions and thus lost a lot of the films substance. As good as Ron Perlman's Hellboy films? Not a chance. But hey was a fun mindless popcorn flick with a big budget.",Hellboy

So when I heard they were gonna reboot it with a different actor I wasn't on board. Then I saw the trailer and saw who was playing Hellboy and I loved him in newsroom and Stanger Things so I gave it a shot. Saw it today and I was blown away how much fun and awesome this was.

The originals were Awesome, Del Toro is a god however the source material was spot on. CGI is cheaper than practical effects like they could use in the original, and to tell the scooe you need that. That's like saying LOTR was bad because of the effects. Simply not true. Hellboy relationship with his father is a big one, along with the prince lf Hell theme. Harbour just had a depth of emotion Pearlman didn't and i love Pearlman! For me though, this has exactly what i needed. A story more comic accurate, definitely more gory and violent like the source material. I love the first two and always will, however this one has exactly what i was waiting for. For those of you that haven't, pick up the comics they are amazing, and you'll get a deeper appreciation for who we all love.",Hellboy

I myself was quite disappointed that they weren't going to continue with the same director and Ron Perlman for the third Hellboy, so I said I'm going to see for myself. Instead of waiting to rent it I bought it on download and man it was absolutely horrible. The special-effects looked so fake....cheap CGI! The sad thing about it is that nothing is wrong with the actors....they're all good actors... I've seen them all play in the roles of their own which prove that they can act but it's the writer that made it suck the direction and most of all the soundtrack. It didn't flow well at all. The pacing was crazy it just didn't have that epic feel to it. It didn't take us into the depths of the surreal world of hell boy like the first one and the golden army.

Much preferred this movie to the PG version done by Del Toro.
It's so much darker - like the graphic novels. Colourful language was much more fitting. Loved the fight scenes.

1043,isillysquirrel,A letdown,3,2 May 2019,"I have every reason to love this movie. Yet another beloved franchise reboot, but one I looked forward to. Guillermo del Toro isn't at the helm, but a rated R version was too enticing to pass up. This meant more gore and no restraint, it had to be good right? No. I read no reviews going in and only heard slightly negative statements beforehand, in effort to be unspoiled. From the outset of the movie, the violence and gore were outlandish. As an avid fan of horror, this isn't inherently wrong, but this movie gave no substance with it. It felt shoe-horned and thoughtless. The characters were dry and attempts at humor had me audibly cringing throughout. I'm not sure what went wrong, but this just didn't do it for me on any level. Only redeeming quality was the appearance of the effects. Even then, however, the movie was riddled with little points of detail that were apparently just ignored: continuity be damned. I wish anyone had spent the two hours I did on this to reconsider this floundering mistake.",Hellboy
1044,fatvampirebluff,Holding True To the Comics Brings Nostalgia,8,18 April 2019,"While Ron Perlman absolutely knocked it out of the park gaining Hellboy popularity, David Harbour brings a new sense of fun, violence and comedy to the role. For those who know the comics the ambush on Hellboy during The Wild Hunt should be no surprise, for those who were unfamiliar it was a shock. In the theater I heard gasps and ""Oh Sh**s"".Let me say that this movie is not the PG-13 movie from the 2000's that was suitable for children. There was a mother and her young son sitting several seats down from me and as soon as Hellboy gored a giant, they left the theater to not return.Milla Jovovich shines as Nimue, bringing the charisma of the Blood Queen and Lady Of The Lake from the comics to life. David Harbour excels as a sarcastic, fun loving and violent Hellboy that Ron Perlman himself has approved of. Ian Mcshane makes Professor Brum more of a sarcastic hardass but it absolutely works, his death at the hands of Nimue pushes Hellboy to take Excalibur in hand and end the Blood Queen and her demons attack on London.The acting was great, the comedy was on point, and the violence was out of the park! Also the introduction of Abe Sapien at the end heavily hints at a new Hellboy-verse which I am very excited for.",Hellboy

There was no part to this film which pulled me in and made me want to watch until the end. All the way through I questioned whether to push on or give up. I eventually made it through and nothing changed my mind.
Apart from the 3 main actors in David Harbour, Milla Jovovich and Ian McShane I believe the casting was poor with the characters coming across quite boring, almost as if the actors were just turning up and rushing through their scenes to collect their pay cheque.
Although the CGI scenes were also quite dissapointing I believe the only positive for me, making it a 4 out of 10 was a selection of the action scenes but apart from that nothing caught my eye.
Unlikely to recommend to anyone who enjoyed the previous hell boy films. Better off holding on to the fond memories of the past films.",Hellboy

But I throughly enjoyed this. I laughed out loud at a lot of the jokes. The dialogue was perfect!Yes, the ending was predictable, but I expect that for a superhero origins story. And the Osiris Club were very cliche British, but it doesn't distract from the story line; it adds to the humour!Milla was superb in her role and I loved her every scene. Feel free to bring her back for the sequel! And after a few minutes you forgot that it was David Harbour on screen - he was just Hellboy.It was wonderful to see Daniel Dae Kim as Ben - and as sidekicks go he's a lot more practical than Abe (much as I love Abe) and I was so proud of Ed Skrein for passing up the role in favour of an Asian actor. We need more of this.As far as the action sequences go - it's very full on with plenty of gore and blood and flying body parts.If I'd paid attention to the critics, I wouldn't have gone to see this and I would have missed out.If I could meet the people that made this, I'd give them a hug and say ""thanks""!

This film had a low budget feel to it throughout, poor CGI and bad score choice during action sequences was very underwhelming. Makeup design on the various supernatural characters left a lot to be desired.
I feel in trying to separate themselves from being compared to Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy movies, the creators took away anything that could have made this movie good.
High praise for set design. The Lobster segment of the movie, starring Thomas Haden Church as the Lobster was very interesting, maybe they should have focused on making that a movie instead. All around a disappointing outing for one of my favorite superheroes.",Hellboy

I went in going hopes down because all the bad reviews and honestly it's hard to imagine anyobody as hellboy besides good ole Ron Perlman. I love the the original hellboy movies, so like I said i went hopes down, expecting to be disappointed, but i was not! I haven't been this excited after seeing a movie since Upgrade. Hellboy has decent laughs, and some awesome gore and entertaining action. The special effects were great and the creatures were excellent! It was very fast paced but not in a bad way. The intro was a little different ( you'll get what I'm saying after you see it) but it was still good! The key aspect they had going for them is they didn't take themsleves too serious. They made a grade A action/gore B-rated flick!
The trick is to go in hopes down and get over the fact we won't unfortunately get to see Del toro/Perlmans 3rd movie and give this reboot a chance! I would love for this movie to have a sequel! But because all you haters be hating, there probably won't be one.Ten years from now this'll be a cult classic!

'Marvelisation' of the movie is obvious and it lacks compared to previous movies and the comics.
Non-stop action and needles gore are all over while (though good) totally misplaced music is there to make...more noise I guess..
Del Toro's movies had connection to the comic that this movie does not. What stuns me about it is that MIke Mignola supposedly worked on a script?!

When I saw a trailer I was less excited and decided I wouldn't waste primo dollars on seeing it in the theater and I'm glad that I didnt.This movie is a mess. The dialogue and plot are boring and predictable;The accents are all really bad and it's sort of distracting; the characters are all unlikeable and one dimensional; and the CGI looks like it had no budget.,Hellboy
1067,RedsAlive,I felt like I was in hell!,2,15 April 2019,"I wasn't going to bother writing a review but I felt compelled when I saw other reviewers giving this film a 9 or 10, Yeah so this film is better than Godfather or Shawshank redemption then?? Seriously people you need to rebase your thinking! Right rant over let's get down to the facts.My thoughts on Hellboy - I liked the Ron Perlman Hellboy films, like not loved but they are way better than this piece of drivel. I actually watched that version when I got home from the cinema, this new one doesn't come remotely close!The pros of this movie
1) It will eventually end so remember you paid money, bought your popcorn so you be a well staying to the end!
2) Erm the one funny line Hellboy says to Milla Jovavich about being a Capricorn and she is crazy?The cons of the movie
1) David Harbour does a poor job of Hellboy, no charisma, not funny, dull boring and that is from someone who is bloody brilliant in Stranger Things.2) What is with Milla Jovovich in this movie, worst English accent I've heard in ages and she just looked disinterested whenever on screen. She was awesome in Resident Evil franchise, which are all way better than this film!
3) The story line, dull, boring and apparently thrown together by a blinded folded person playing darts. There is NO comedy in this film apart from 1 (YES 1) line I mentioned in my PROS.
The story changes halfway through, this really is just a whole load of scenes edited together to make a film, unfortunately the scenes come from about 12 different films. Its utter gibberish.4) CGI, I never knew I was going into see a B movie Video Nasty, I don't mind gore but that's obviously the only thing the director though he could do with this film, it gets really tedious by the end. Especially with the warthog with the Tourette's syndrome.5) The action, pretty basic stuff really, not much different to driving miss daisy, oh wait it was dull as I have now blanked it from my memory. Wish I could blank the whole bloody experience.To sum up, dull, boring, rubbish, tedious, no chemistry, poor direction, very poor story line, really really badly thrown together set of scenes. I really feel I am being generous with this 2 rating. Save you money, save your Soul go and see something else!!!!!!",Hellboy
1068,murnikis77,I Really Tried To Like It....But Everything Is Just Off,3,22 April 2019,"I ignored the critics and didn't read one review. I went to the movie hoping to see a character I really enjoy in Hellboy. I love the comics as they are imaginative and fun. The movie looked more gritty then it's predecessor so I was excited to see it. I was hoping for sequels and more Hellboy then just this movie. How could they mess it up? If anything it would be fun to see Hellboy running around and some cool action.Watching the movie I enjoyed David Harbour's portrayal of the big red guy, but after that it really ended there. The movie is without a doubt a big mess and that's being very kind. It felt like important things were missing or removed. The pacing was all over the place intertwined with hard rock music taking us from scene to scene. I don't mind that kind of thing but it felt like overkill after the first 30 min. The way Hellboy was written felt more like an asshole than a lovable bad ass so I had trouble rooting for him. He's a smart character but he always seemed to question everything but not enough to stop whatever bad thing was going to happen until it started happening. Where was his knowledge of the occult? One scene with baby Alice was about it.I don't know if the stories about the troubled production is true or not, but it's sure hard to ignore how bad the editing was. It felt like if the film was better edited it would have been a million times better. I have no problem with gore or violence but I definitely do when it's meaningless and has no point. Seeing CGI person after person ripped apart doesn't really serve a purpose. One particular moment almost made me throw up. Meanwhile the dead kid moment with Baba Yaga only seemed to hurt Hellboy's character. Here's a moment where the violence serves a purpose and I have no problem with it to an extent. But here's our hero seeing the hanging dead bodies of children as they are being served to him to eat. Strange since Baba Yaga had to know Hellboy would want nothing to do with that. But he doesn't react to it. You can argue that he had to buy his time to learn where the Blood Witch is, but the movie misses a great opportunity. Why not have him get enraged? Attack Baba Yaga then and find a way to get what he needs. That's how you would think a hero would react. Instead it almost comes across like it bothered him but not a lot really. Again you could argue the scene works but it didn't for me. He does yell at her when they finally fight about the children, but it feels too late.By the end of the movie I didn't care if Dr. Broom was killed. There was no heart or soul in the movie that built the character up enough to care even with a great actor like Ian McShane. Here's a scene that should be powerful and emotional but it falls flat. The ending when Hellboy wins is also very anti-climactic. Hell I would have been happy with some great action scenes but even that doesn't happen in this movie. The best action is with the Giants but the CGI is just bad. I found myself caught off guard by how weird it was seeing CGI Hellboy throw things at great distances to impale these Giants when he's supposed to be severely wounded. Yet everything he does seems off in that scene. Really that sums up the whole movie. The motivations, the dialog, the editing, even the audio throughout is just disjointed and off. If it's true the producer made constant changes to the Directors film I'd be very interested to see the Directors Cut, because this movie is just a mess. This isn't even a movie i would buy when it comes out. I really just don't want to see it again. So very disappointing.",Hellboy
1069,luis_92163,If you like the hellboy comics you will enjoy it,8,3 August 2019,Most reviews on this page compare this new remake with the ones Guillermo del Toro did or critize the character or script but the movie stick to the comics a lot and goes straight to the point for a 2 hour movie. It doesn´t focus on a lot of things people already know and most just know things because of the del Toro couple of movies. The movie is gore and funny in some parts just like the comics. In a time where people just mindlessly adore heroes presented in the marvel cinematic universe this movie in particular represent the anti hero hellboy just like it is and I only do this mention because the movie release the same month as endgmae so in a lot of countries or movie theaters this movie wasn't feature or only lasted like a couple of weeks.,Hellboy

It has some funny moments, but most of them were already in the trailer so on that part it doesn't give too much as well. The dialogues are pretty bad in general, the story is too much of everything and some of the other actors fail to impress, one of them even falls in and out of accent which is quite annoying.

1084,nwertanen,Exhaustingly busy and inept.,7,12 April 2019,"So, Hellboy 2019. How do I adequately describe it? Two movies previously have been used by me as the standard of ineptitude. Of just really, really bad movies. Those being Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters and Gods of Egypt. This Hellboy reboot maybe sits a hair above them, but not by much. Holy Hannah was it awful. Made all the more frustrating by moments of mostly okay-ness, as it follows beats from the comics well enough, although mostly the later comics, which is odd for a first film reboot. But mostly it just felt very disjointed. Things just sorta happen and keep happening at random. The film is just exhaustingly busy. Secondary plot threads keep coming up, and you get the sense you've missed a lot of things. Which the film lazily makes up for in constant flashbacks. Which is what happens when you take your main plot from a story very late in the overall comics story. That main plot, such as it is, is pretty dry, and the resolution was both predictable and short. Once it finally got there. First comes suffering. My god. The first 15-20 minutes is an absolute train wreck, from which it never recovers. It just keeps going, never reaching the potential of the comics or original films. It lacked the coherency of the comics. It was missing the design, charm and heart of the Del Toro films, and Ron Perlman was sorely missed. David Harbour has moments, but it just never felt right. As each new sequence started I had to resist the urge to look at the time and see how much suffering I had left to endure. Finally resigned to my fate, and invested enough for my human brain to want a resolution, I finished the movie. But man was it rough. This was just a really bad film. #hellboy #hellboymovie #hellboy2019 #badmovies #endmysuffering",Hellboy

It had the right tone in my opinion. The tension between HB and Broom was a bit to advanced and that slightly detracted for me. The other problem with the film was they crammed a LOT into it. It felt rushed and slightly disconnected and disjointed in parts. This had potential to be lot better. It was a lot of fun but glad potential to be amazing.

The only ""bad"" cgi that I saw was during the scene where hellboy clenches his fist really quick and when a scorpion crawls down his hand. The scenes with the giants were REALLY fun to watch and losten to! What the heck is wrong with people, did we all watch a different movie. In Portugal films dont get censorted and there even was an 11 year old kid sitting by my side. The jokes were actually funny as compared to Captain Marvel and Shazam garbage dialogue.

The gore in the movie was by no mens exagerated.The movie has a brilliant pace and it actually pains me to think that the director and crew belive they made a great movie but for some unbelievable reason all the reviews are terrible.Something wrong with people these days.

The film is below average at best and although there are some entertaining sequences in there, on the whole I left feeling very disappointed.This should have and could have been amazing, but simply isn't. And all the people fooling themselves by saying it was, you're selling yourself short.The CGI is awful too. There's a Scouse pig.

Best of all, he didn't have any lines that didn't sound like something Hellboy would say.Makeup has definitely improved since Guillermo Del Toro version. Not that anything was wrong with it, just more details were added like scars, hair looking more realistic, horns looking more like actual horns instead of just stumps.To be fair, I'm not going to tear down Ian McShane as Professor Broom since it's not his fault John Hurt isn't available anymore (may he Rest In Peace).On a whole, not a good film but at least it had some redeeming qualities.",Hellboy

Naturally, we were apprehensive about it given the new cast, new writer/director and the apparent disconnect from the events of the established films, but we gave it a chance to surprise us regardless. And it turned out that our instincts were correct; the movie was absolute garbage. I hated the new cast. They were completely unlikeable, seemingly made of wood and communicated entirely in the most vulgar language imaginable. The plot itself showed a massive departure from Del Toro's incredible imagination, apparently substituting it with a liberal application of public domain characters, stories and themes (a lot of which attempts to rewrite the established narrative from the first two films), and with a frankly sickening degree of gratuitous violence and gore thrown in for God knows what reason. For myself and my wife, despite staying with it to the end, this movie was a total waste of time.

The only reason I waist my time to review this awful movie, is the fact that many real contributors (not from false accounts from the studio) are saying that Ian McShane is playing ok. In my opinion, Ian version of resurrected Professor Broom is more awful than this entire film. He simply performs the over arrogant character he always plays. Needless to say the undead professor is far away from the character from the original movie and is a very unnecessary change. The elegant character from the first movie is now a sneaky and gross guy, who lies his adopted son instead of teaching him.

As for the acting, the dialogue was simply a string of exhausted film tropes and bad one-liners to the point that I could predict exactly what the characters would say before they said it.

As a big fan of the comics, the idea of a more serious adult take that skewed closer to the source material sounded amazing to me and almost worth sacrificing Del Toro's 3rd part for... sadly, now that I see what we got instead, I gotta admit I'd have preferred one last Del Toro film.That said, this isn't as bad as the critical dog-pile would have you believe. I'm glad I read the reviews before seeing this as my expectations were lowered to such a degree that it couldn't help but exceed them. Yes it was bloated, cheesy, poorly written, unnecessarily gratuitous, and had very uneven special effects, but it had a certain pulpy charm to it and there were some very fun moments peppered throughout. I was definitely entertained the whole time. You can't really top Perlman, but Harbour was a great Hellboy (despite that horrible makeup and those atrocious one-liners), and even if everyone else in the film was horribly mis-cast, they do a good job anyway. As a comic fan it was fun seeing so many moments from the comics woven into the film, but claims that this was a more faithful adaptation of the source material may have been somewhat exaggerated.Anyone who's a fan of the comics should give this a watch just for the hell of it, and you might actually even like it if you're a fan of b-movies, gory action-comedy and/or everything-and-the-kitchen-sink fantasy films.

Sure its wasn't the greatest plot and a little all over the place at times, but I saw this movie for what it was, an action packed thrill ride meant for the ones that miss the carnage and slaughter. I'm afraid all these bad reviews will be the demise of this current rebooted franchise. This is unfortunate for David Harbor when given his terrific performance, was never going to fill the big shoes of Ron Perlman in the eyes of the ""Purists"".

The blend of practical and visual effects was nice to see and Harbour as HellBoy was a perfect fit. Is the the movie perfect though? Well ... no but it does so many things right and keeps the feel of the comics, more so than the Perlman movies. I feel like most critics who watched this were wanting it to be a Marvel type movie, or headed into it with the past movies in mind and used that as their basis for what HellBoy should be.

The movie is way more faithful to the comics but it also tries to be faithful to the previous movies (which every reboot should try to be) but it just becomes a mess of attempts.
The CGI is overused- WHEN WILL STUDIOS LEARN!- and although the creatures design is very interesting, pretty much every character lacks the dept the old duology provided.
At the end of the day Hellboy(2019) is just another failed reboot that tries to be it's own thing while respecting the previous movies.
My rating?
5 out of 10, but I do agree with the 61% rating on rotten tomatoes because the movie isn't all crap, there's a charm to it but it's not enough to make you overlook it's flaws.
Just watch the Guillermo del Toro duology, it's a far superior franchise, and I would of loved to see the third movie if the studios didn't cancelled it.
If you are interested in the director Neill Marshall (which despite the failed attempt of rebooting Hellboy is a damn good director) go watch Dog Soldiers which is criminally underrated.

There's nothing I can think of to defend this cinematographic abomination. This extremely ugly shot cosplay version of Mike Mignola's Hellboy comic does not even attempt to tell a coherent story. The soundtrack consists of some out of place rock songs that are stuck in random places in the film. Unlike Del Toro's films, there is no way of feeling any sympathy for the one-dimensional characters. The endless stream of silly one-liners and aimless quips make you realize that these annoyingly unpleasant characters have nothing to tell us over the course of two (!) excruciating hours. The movie simply jumps from exposition piece to action scene and back again. And where Guillermo Del Toro created a tactile world with a balanced combination of practical effects work and sparingly used CGI, we are now saddled with special effects that look like the deleted scenes from a Playstation 3 game. It's incomprehensible that Mignola believes that this soulless version is closer to the comics.

And there's a lot of people who are probably angry that this is not del Toro's 'Hellboy 3'.
This film is really good. It's VERY faithful to the comics. And it is METAL! Extremely metal. This most metal movie I have seen. And it isn't watered down, nor is it apologetic. There is violence and gore, as there should be! This is Hellboy. Spawn suffered some due to censorship, but not this. Overall it was very enjoyable.
You are also going to have people complaining that this film is very violent. DUH! This movie is rated R for a reason. DON'T TAKE YOUR KIDS UNDER 13!!! If they are 14 and older, use your best judgement. If you liked Dredd, you will like this.
This movie is not perfect. There are some issues concerning pacing. This is because they do use a LOT of content and do go through it very fast, and don't have time to really develop it. But, it doesn't hurt the movie nor does it make it any less enjoyable. Causal readers of the comic and hardcore fans will get the references, plots, and characters more than someone who's just a movie goer or who just watches super hero movies.
David Harbour does an excellent job as Hellboy. He really brings the character to life. It's different from Pearlman's, but, his Hellboy really sings of the one from the comics.

The role of the big bad was beautifully played by Milla Jovovich (fair warning on this part I have been nursing a 20 + year crush on her). Daniel Dae Kim and Sasha Lane were great in their roles of Domino and Alice. They add a little more depth to help flesh on the new world created for the film.

I'll start with bad things regarding this movie: casting sasha lane as Alice was a shot in the leg by production team. And on that, bad things end. Everything else was well done. This is one action packed, gore packed and humor packed film with monsters, creatures, shapeshifters, witches, fairies, demons and king Arthur and somehow, everything works! Everything is in place and in harmony with oneanother. This was always a tricky thing when you have that many thing to put in two hour long film, but Marshall is a directing gem and was able to do that with an ease. Performance of Harbour as Hellboy is masterfully done and was a great casting choice, as well as suporting actors (Jovovich, Dae Kim and McShane).But, if you want to compare this film to del Toros one, just don't. It's a complitly different kind of movie, for start, 2019 version is a R-rated film and with that, it's not a fairy-tale, but a correct representation of a comic. On the matter of looks, this version looks at least as good as del Toro's film, but on a smaller budget. Even a performence of Harbour as Hellboy surpasses the one of Perlman.
Don't get me wrong, I like the ""old"" films, a lot, but I think that this film is better in anyway.If you want compare this movie with other films made by Marshall, it goes hand in hand with Dog soldiers and The Descent, and that are great movies.

1168,ashjaderouse,Extremely disappointed.,2,16 April 2019,"(does include spoilers, I am in no means a writer, this is my thoughts and me spilling out crap about this movie)
While I never expected much when hearing about the remake of HellBoy without Ron Perlman or Guillermo del Toro, I was overly disappointed with this movie.
Now I have been a massive fan of HellBoy for as long as I can remember, I have read and own most of the comic books and while the first two movies by Del Toro weren't linked to the comics as much as most people would have liked and weren't as gore induced as it could have been. However atleast it wasn't completely filled with dull one liners and acting I would expect from highschoolers, unlike the remake.
Listing everything wrong with this movie. The quality of costume for the main character hellboy was painfully fake. The horns moved around when touched. Yes this could be classed as being picky towards basic stuff but they are horns, bone that should be attached to a skull. In the del Toro movies they atleast looked real. His stone hand in the remake was basic. No detail! Which is what his hand needs considering it a key, which might I add was not mentioned during the movie!.
The animation was painful and looked like the movie was made in the early 2000s. The acting.. Oh the acting, for a remake that was so hyped up and seriously wanted and needed since HellBoy 2 the golden army (well we wanted a 3 hellboy not a remake) the acting was something I would have expected from a low budget movie that lasts an hour. Also half of the cast was from he TV show eastenders.. I know they filmed in England but we do have amazing actors that could have been used. The story line was all over the place!!! They focused too much on trying to make it completely like the comic books and seriously forgot that pushing too much into a movie is going to make it confusing and unwatchable.... Guess they get that gold star for effort. The list of everything wrong with this movie is something I could go on and on about.. Which I have.
Basically don't waste your money, don't waste your time at all. This movie is something that should be ignored and forgotten and HellBoy 3 with del Toro should be considered more and made. To help us all forget about this disaster of a movie.",Hellboy
1169,yarosmartyn,Underrated beauty of gore and hell.,8,17 April 2019,"Personally, I really enjoyed the movie. It is beautiful, it has quite good actors, great soundtrack and a fine plot.
There is only a few things that I really disliked. I did not read the comics and watched the first movies a long time ago so I am reviewing it as something that is not connected to any stories.
First of all, the drama looks really not finished. They TELL us about the problems of Hellboy with his father but they don't show us the problems, and it's like that with almost every dramatic part of this movie, I couldn't feel sorry for any characters, even if I really wanted to. All this ""You didn't love me""/ ""You didn't pay enough attention to me""/ etc., it's just told. We can't see all this so we could feel the characters' problems. It just looks unfinished.
Second, quite big part of the plot is based on the doubts of Hellboy about people, his power, the Devil inside him and what he can actually become and what he is afraid of. Again, they just didn't finish it. They did not put enough story for his doubts. There is no emotional worries about what he can become and why he doesn't.
In my opinion, everything is great but the dramatic and ""feeling"" part of the movie and this is the biggest problem and mistake.
Also I'm a bit dissatisfied because there was not enough BATTLES WITH METAL scenes. Because the few that were in the movie look really awesome but... it's just a few!
In general, I enjoyed it but the thought that it could really be perfect and not just great makes me upset, because the movie is really underrated.
Since my review has spoilers, I cannot advice it here but if you like reading reviews with spoilers - go and watch the movie. It worth it but not for people that dislike guts, guns and demons.",Hellboy
1170,julianpeter-46856,Entertaining,8,17 April 2019,"Overall, really enjoyed the movie. Thought it was entertaining and fresh. I liked that they didn't hold back on the gore and ""creatures"". To be objective, there are some areas for improvement (soundtrack selection for a particular ambush scene, and certain bits of acting) but, would definitely like to see a sequel and more of this story and style!",Hellboy

1172,savvy_sparrow-12583,One hell of a ride.,9,18 April 2019,"I've always been a long time fan and reader of the Hellboy comics.The movies moved me and made me excited to see Big Red on the theater screen. The first two movies I watched countless times, and I'll not downgrade the great films they Del Toro, Ron Perlman and crew did to bring one of my favorite comic book personas to life.That being said, I do feel strongly that the 2019 adaptation, as well as David Harbour's take on the role and movie in general did the comic series proud.It kept all if the spectral and mythological essence the comics were known for, and wasn't flooded with the typical and Hollywood expectations of romance that I felt tampered the second original Hellboy movie.It kept fairly true to its comic roots, well balanced with sordid humor and grim darkness it was known to have.
And, despite the comparison to MCU there isn't and shouldn't be one. Hellboy is it's own character with it's own back history and build that had a VERY strong backing well before MCU and DC had it's cards into play.Long story short, drop comparisons and appreciate the movie and story for what it is. I found myself pleasantly surprised for this movie and can't wait to see it again, with hopes of a sequel.",Hellboy
1173,tubaaer,Not what I expected,3,18 April 2019,"Firstly I appreciate all the people who worked hard for this film but as a hellboy and Guillermo del Toro's fan it is a big no for me. I hoped that this film was kind of a contuniation of Mr .Toro's work like new version of Blade runner. I mean I thought that the director would have kept Mr.Toro's style and point of view about the main character who is funny, sarcastic, stubborn and kind of arrogant and also the atmosphere of the film which is steam punkish and mysterious.But unfortunately everything was changed in this movie from storyline to even light. I was disappointed. I don't like it. I am sorry.",Hellboy

1177,thedscaptain,Do not waste your money,2,22 April 2019,"If you enjoy movies with flowing plot, interesting dialogue, or enjoy the hellboy movies comics or otherwise skip this movie. The only reason this gets two stars is the references to darkhorses other works and the allegedly true to comics storyline. The acting is sub-par with a highschool media project and the story jumps so far so many times to cover points they should have either broken it into two movies and let the second not get funded or just not at all. The music mixing was botchy and would sometimes rise over the dialouge, or worse all of it turned up so that the same genre fight music would blast so loudly in the theatures that you were more focused on a bad guitar riff not synching with a punch than what hellboy was punching. During an early scene when hellboy is filling his horns you can see the prosthetic move on his skin. Its extremely apparent that the entire movies budget was spent on actors from larger films who had nothing better to do than spit 1980esq lines. The villans and the CGI work were solid enough but the movie was so forcefully fast paced you never really get a good look at some of the creatures that someone so lovingly created for this movie. The gore at the end of the movie was so over the top that you had to roll your eyes at it. Why would you put so much thought and creativity and detail into something the audience sees .5 seconds of before the entire screen is nothing but spongey blood. The best part about this movie was that they didnt drag abe sapien through the garbage disposal to create an ""inspired by comic"" look. Skip this movie or bring earplugs and turn your screen brightness down while you text your bank asking if you can call the purchase fraud.",Hellboy

1180,brendanbutcher-22982,Through Hell and Back,6,24 April 2019,"Ok I'm just going to be straight with this review. I usually don't partake in reviewing movies since more high profile sites and critics will most likely make this review vanish amongst a sea of other reviews but I'm making an exception with this one.I am a fan of the Hellboy comics and when I saw the rt score it immediately thought back to last Falls Venom and how much I enjoyed that movie even with its faults.Hellboy 2019 is a little different since I don't know how to really feel about this. Some of creature designs were incredible, Hellboy looked awesome, and bonus points are given to it being based off an actual story. But the cgi....Sweet merciful lord is the cgi bad and the film does a lot and I mean A LOT of jumping around since its trying to cram so much exposition into its run time.One moment we are being told about Nimue and her plan of bringing a horrid plague, then next we're with Hellboy fighting his friend whom he kills then we're in Colorado, then we're in London. then theirs a pig dude, then theirs the Osiris club, then theirs Hellboy's origin, then theirs giants, then theirs 2 new characters, then theirs Nimue being brought back, then theirs filler, then Hellboy bitches like a teen going through puberty, and then and then and then I mean jesus christ theres so much god damn jumping inbetween plots that it felt like an attack on the senses.Some of the fights were entertaining but I swear the CGI was laughable at best. But does it make the movie a bad movie? Not at all. If I could I would chalk up to a requel (remake/prequel) if it weren't for the obvious use of modern technology (IPhones and yeah I am stretching it with IPhones) since good ol' Abe Sapien makes an appearance at the end of the movie.Will there be a sequel? I strongly doubt it. Maybe if this movie was given a much larger budget and help with production it may have worked out.",Hellboy
1181,danielgenek,"Fun, Fast, Fail?",6,24 April 2019,"While Hellboy jumps right into the ass kicking that we all know and love him for, did he jump a little too fast?The movie starts off with a humorous Hellboy fight. A great way to show the lightness of the film. However, almost immediately after it just nose dives into a little ... self pity. Maybe it's just me, but it left a sour taste in my mouth afterwards. Unfortunately there's a lot of emotion jumping throughout.Now don't get me wrong. I LOVE the fact that this version has actual emotions. Perlman's Hellboy was fun, but just seemed more like a try Harding comedic relief through the dark tone of Mr. Del Toro. With Harbor as the lead, we got a full range of emotions. Which to me, is what really brings people to involve themselves in a movie.With that being said, there were a few too many ""jokes"" that missed their punch line. Which again, left a silly image of this should be badass Hero film. Look, if you're going to make a joke by all means. But don't rely on it to save the day, from a rather dry scene.Now Pace, the movie really just launched you in. Which is GREAT! I can't stand when people dwell on excess backstory to fill time in movies. With Hellboy, they really just layed it all out on the table. However they did it at such an odd pace, I often found myself thinking ""When did we get here, and why?"".Overall :The movie was FUN. And that is exactly what a movie like this should be. Some corny jokes, badass fights, gore, horror. Unfortunately the writing, directing, CGI, and editing made it all fall flat. The actors did a beautiful job, and truly deserve a second chance to prove to everyone what a real Hellboy movie is.",Hellboy
1182,ivanthetank,It was a good movie in my opinion,5,25 April 2019,The only criticisms I have is that the cgi in the troll fight scene was like they had an hour to do it and they rushed to make because in one of the scenes hellboy just clips through a sword not hurt at all and also the lighting was a little off and the scenes looked like you were using a real place with a crappy cgi overtop of it making it worse,Hellboy

1185,thefirstredshoulder,Rather embarassing really,1,10 July 2019,"The only thing more jarring than the Spawn-level special effects are the horribly mismatched red hues used on Hellboy's makeup and prosthetics. So much of this film is poorly thought out and devoid of any logic. One of the first scenes has Hellboy fighting a beast with wings. He throws the beast in the air and instead of it using it's wings to simply fly it instantly falls to it's death. This really sets the tone for the rest of the film. Even the action is phoned in. In some cases the ""gore"" simply looks like a crew member standing out of shot had a bucket of body parts they tossed in front of the camera to simulate some sort of action/struggle. Utterly tragic. Why on earth was this film made?",Hellboy

Objectivly i would rate the movie 8/10 but because captain marvel (which was an absolute thrash movie with thrash acting) is getting undeserved higher scores (even tho most reviews are low scores), i will back this movie up and rate it a 10/10 since it's a fun experience to watch and way better then movies such as captain marvel and shazam.",Hellboy

I thought Hellboy is a superhero movie, but it's more like a horror movie that could make teenagers have a nightmares. Why can't you make it just like a Deadpool movie?

Oh how wrong I was. This film doesn't know what it wants to be, is it action, drama, comedy, The plot is all over the place, the characters are not developed enough for you to care about the plot and the issues the protagonists face. Some of the characters are outright boring, the action scenes are poorly developed, so many CGI problems, the ending is so rushed you don't even know what they are fighting for, and it ends so suddenly.

I also thought Daniel Dae Kim's Daimio had some interesting backstory, but the accent was unnecessary and distracting. Otherwise, this movie was a total mess. There were too many characters and too many plot lines, none of which connected in any way that made sense. Heaven and hell, biblical mythology, Arthurian legends (for some reason), pagan fairies and changelings, Baba Yaga. This movie couldn't figure out what it wanted to be. I never felt like I understood why anything was happening or what storylines I was supposed to be following. I was lost the entire time. Just a bunch of big action set pieces strung together. Whoever wrote this monstrosity should really consider a different line of work. It's a shame because I like quite a few of these actors, but their potential was definitely wasted on this mess of a film.",Hellboy

It honestly feels like the creates believe all us viewers are as stupid as the big pig guy who is about as forgettable as any old extra. Hellboy himself is played as a stroppy child who can't for the love of all things make up his mind on whether he has the power of literal Satan or is just a bean bag from gym class getting thrown about by any old chump. And the villain is so over acted that she feels forced upon us and doesn't fit within the film. Poor Ian McShane usually brings a smile to my face whenever he appears on a screan, but like the blood queen (if that's what she was called) he doesn't fit with the rest of the film. Also it would seem like most of the budget was blown on big names instead of quality, and it shows in the CGI which makes the T-1000 look like a modern marvel. Really the creators of the film should have put more time and money into creating a clean flowing story that appealed to a wider audience instead of hiring the big names and concentrating on the more special needs audience.",Hellboy

1230,SkagenSailingCrew,Best Movie of 2019 - Simply Brilliant,10,10 October 2019,"Hellboy (2019) is by far movie of the year with its 2 hours of constant excitement, jaw-dropping effects, incredible acting and some of the best movie puns seen to date. After watching it we all just stared at the TV hoping for more, but sadly that was it.
Neil Marshall has truly managed to direct a masterpiece where everything fits perfectly. Especially the plot is amazing, where small twists are introducted throughout the movie to keep viewers on the edge of their seat.Simply Brilliant.\SkagenSailingCrew",Hellboy
1231,Wha_eva,Despicable,1,2 November 2019,"Extremely disappointing.
People warned me but I hoped they were wrong.
It feels as they rushed through everything. Picked some folklore here and there, put it all together and didn't even make an effort of blending it.
Every single aspect looks like it comes out of another movie; from the story to the monsters. Bad lines, no creativity, terrible visual effects, even the actors couldn't make up for this joke of a movie.
Some people try to defend this as ""Just take it as it comes and have a good laugh"", but given it wasn't even funny...
I am glad I didn't pay to see it in cinema, but definitely regret buying the DVD.
I usually wanna know the end once I start a movie, you never know it might surprise you halfway, but I literally couldn't wait for this horror to be over.

The acting is sub-par for most of the actors, even the well known names.
CGI effects are really bad and again you can see a lot of mistakes.
Post production and lighting is inconsistent and all over the place, one scene can be quite dark, the next is super bright which makes the obvious prosthetics so much more visible.It has all the look and feel of a fanmade film.So unless you love B movies or are a glutton for punishment, do something better with your time.I actually had to make this IMDB account just to write this review and warn others.",Hellboy

The protagonists were dull and predictable, the antagonists were unmotivated and lame, and the story was filled with plot holes and a confusing flow.Ultimately the movie was a horrible disappointment and if I ever was forced to watch it again, I'd save my eyes the strain and put a sleep mask on them.",Hellboy

1242,PurpleP3opleEater,Lovely stuff,7,15 April 2020,"An irreverent, tongue-in-cheek action-horror with plenty of fast-paced, over the top entertainment to be had. It's precisely the right tone for the wonderfully ludicrous, quasi-comedic subject matter. Anyone somehow expecting coherence or Hamlet should look elsewhere. But if it's rollicking popcorn entertainment, with a poke at pompous pretence - and a hot, heavy slab of gore thrown on top - then you're in the right place. Yes, it's sketchy in some areas, but there is a certain license for that here - your suspense of disbelief will be required on all sorts of levels. The film has its surprises & most importantly, it doesn't take itself too seriously (unlike some critics, it seems!). It's looseness IS its sincerity. Whilst it doesn't quite go down the B-movie shlock route, it gives a similar thrill of guilty pleasure. Whilst I find myself increasingly disenchanted with much of the dross that pours out of the silver screen these days; I feel these guys were robbed at the box office with this Hellboy reboot - having personally disliked the Perlman incarnation. A lot of critics draw parallels to other films/works, but I say: forget all that. Leave your expectations behind & make up your own minds.",Hellboy

This reboot/remake of the comic character from Dark Horse is one of those films. Another thing this has in common with Cruise's failed bomb is that it is more focused on setting up storylines for future movies and dumping exposition instead of...well, actually making sure THIS movie is a good movie. David Harbour does a fine job all things considered. And there may have been a moment or two where it did sort of work. I'll give props to this movie for at least trying to go in a different direction that Del Toro's previous films. This one goes for that R rating, tries to go for a more Horror focused route. But ironically, the Del Toro films (unsurprisingly) show more maturity and dark moments than this movie. At the end of the day, this movie is a mess that isn't worth the watch.",Hellboy

Overall this movie is a solid 8 star for me. The only mistake that the production team has done is making it a reebot. If you reebot a failed movie series one may make a successful movie .

How are you supposed to compress that into a single movie?Take Hellboy's fight with the giants (it's in the trailer, not a spoiler). In the book, he doesn't have to fight the giants. He does it anyway to show himself what kind of a monster he is. In the movie he does it, because... it looks cool I guess? (It doesn't. The CGI is bad and the choreography is awful.)This is basically the whole movie in a nutshell, with some gross-out violence sprinkled on top.

I went with a friend to watch it and we both almost leave the theater after the first 15 minutes of the movie, we only stayed because we were hoping that something good happened at some moment, but we saw our hopes crushed with every minute that passed.

They should have made Hellboy 3, with Perlman and Del Toro instead of this monstruosity... the last movie I remember I wanted to leave the theater before the movie finished was Shyamalan's The Last Air Bender... and I would rather watch that movie again a thousand times before having to watch this movie one more time, I can't understand how that movie has a lower score than this one...",Hellboy

This movie doesnt have the level of feels that you got from the original but they are still there and it has a good balance of everything else.The negatives would be the use of CGI over traditional effects (that is a minor gripe tho) and that if you didn't know much about Hellboy lore then you might not know whats going on with some of the characters.Overall it was a solid reboot, an enjoyable movie, and i would definitely recommend watching it!",Hellboy

The cgi, acting, writing, mood, theme, everything really was top notch. David Harbour is a fantastic Hellboy and his performance shouldn't be discredited or trashed simply because he isn't Ron Perlman. Admittedly, Ron and del Toro both wanted to do a 3rd Hellboy, and they were fantastic with the 1st 2 movies, but the studio wanted a change for god-knows-why, and I wish they had given Ron and del Toro a 3rd movie. I honestly think the only reason people are giving this movie bad ratings and reviews is because ""it's not Ron"" and that's just not fair to David Harbour. But that is neither here nor there. This movie was great. It was entertaining and I enjoyed it a lot. My only real complaint is...*spoiler alert*...that it is the same basic plot-line as the original (with just enough tweaks and changes to keep it fresh); and while the new slightly altered plot is actually really good - so good that I kinda wish the original Perlman movie had used this plot - I really think it would have been much better if they had just written something new for this reboot rather than retelling the same story.",Hellboy

It seemed restrictive and cumbersome, transforming Harbour into Peter Bogdanovich's film ""Mask"" than into Mike Mignola's iconic depictions of Hellboy (I'm not trying to be funny or sarcastic, it's honestly what I was reminded of in every scene) - In contrast Del Toro's Hellboy never once took me out of the film no matter what was on screen...The cuts in the story didn't gel the film together neatly despite being well shot - my wife was left picking scenes to pieces as the joins we're all too visibly strung together.The dialogue was also delivered, for me, unconvincingly. I wasn't looking for Oscar winning moments but the interaction with ""the Wild Hunt"" was painful to watch and seemed more fitting for a Monty Python sketch... Maybe that was the intention?Also some of the decisions to completely depart from the visuals of the first two films made me judge what I preferred more and unfortunately Del Toro knocked the franchise out of the ball park... Not so much this one.I enjoyed Mills Jovovich's depiction of the witch and always like hearing Ian McShane's leathery tones...I'll go back to the film to see if it improves in days, weeks, years to come but I fear it will be more episodic than cinematic...

Hellboy himself as the character was more realistic visually with David Harbour truly bringing him to life, making his personality stand out and unique from the original hellboy adaptation. Also, Hellboy was more like a son to his father rather than the property of his father with the title of son. Was it corny at moments? Of course! but it didn't take away from the movie magic.

But all this jolly fun is only true IF you make it through the first 30 minutes.At first glance, you may notice the plastic mask of the new Hellboy (about the same quality and budget as if you would make a Halloween mask yourself, using nothing but red clay) but if you just imagine you're watching a stop-motion Pingu clay figure, you'll get used to it real fast and then you can start enjoying the rest of the movie. I mean, who doesn't love Pingu. He's friggin awesome. Robby is too. And now Hellboy joins their little tribe too.

So first off, STOP COMPARING THIS TO DEL TOROS WORK. Del Toro did not invent hellboy. He simply adapted the source material with his own spin. Don't get me wrong, I love the orginal two...BUT, all these negative reviews by people who are determined to hate it because of the Del toro movies is downright childish to be quite honest.Second, Harbour does a bloody fantastic job of bringing hellboy to life. While still not exactly the same as the comic hellboy, his damn close, way more so than Ron Perlmen.Now as a longstanding mega fan of the comics I can safely say this was made for the fans. It has so many utterly satisfying scenes, nods, characters and scenarios, subtle and not so subtle ripped straight from the comics. So if you're a fan of the comics , you will get that little extra bit of satsifaction.I was thoroughly entertained as both a fan and a movie goer.
If you dont go in expecting a oscar winning masterpiece. You're in a for one incredibly entertaining, gore filled, epic quest of a movie.

1293,nickvmeel,"Not all bad, but..",5,9 July 2019,"IF you haven't seen Del Toro's movies and IF you're just a casual viewer, it's not all bad.But..Compared to the Del Toro movies it's the worst iteration so far. David Harbour as Hellboy was entertaining but doesn't measure up to Ron Perlman's portrayal in the originals. Ian McShane had some memorable moments but his last moments in the movie was just too much and aside from him the only noteworthy performance came from Milla Jovovich, which isn't that stellar either.
There's hardly any chemistry between Hellboy and his ""crew"" aside from the bond with his father, played by Ian McShane. Other than that the dialogue is wooden at times and consists mainly of oneliners. The original was quirky, at times crude but this one is just crass.Both the CGI and camerawork are messy and quality varies greatly from scene to scene and at times where the CGI is actually good it's hampered by shoddy framing.If you're just looking for a fun, gory popcorn flick to which to put your feet up for approx. 2 hrs and aren't bothered by the things mentioned above. Go ahead and watch it, I'm sure you'll be entertained!And if Mike Mignola thinks this comes close to his graphic novels, great! I haven't read them myself so I really can't compare.

He tries to do his best and is funny at times, but the movie as a whole is just so terribly written, directed and cut that it makes no sense at all.
First thing you notice is awful CGI. Hellboy's hand looks like it's made out of foam and wiggles all the time, especially in the beginning of the movie. Just look and the scorpion scene and you can see the rendering is just wrong. Scenes are cut in such ways I had to rewind, because I was sure I've missed something. But no, it's just the way it is. I am so sorry this happened to a beloved character, but I honestly cannot recommend this flick. You will be much better of re-watching the original or just reading a comic. Any comic.",Hellboy

The film in itself gives that roller-coaster feeling, and it's great someone brought the unseen world to life. I loved all the Wiccan and Pagan in it, and I'm very much curious to find out whose voice we are hearing at the very end (gotta sit all through the credit lines, as the middle one is not the last one) - I'd love to be Dracula's, but Rasputin's wouldn't mind me at all!",Hellboy

I wish the Queen had a more prominent standing, but I think its well played considering the story. Yes, there are many holes but heck, I think the cost and complications of filling them would hardly be justified.
In all, I think there is only one scene in the main body that I would consider not really fitting, but since the characters are all fantastic and the props well done, I simply enjoyed it as well.

This is a very different take on these iconic characters and the world they inhabit and it is the most fun version that I've seen so far. Don't get me wrong, I loved GDT's films, the man crafts beautiful modern fairly tales and this film was smart no to try and replicate that. Instead, this movie has more in common with #SamRaimi's #ArmyOfDarkness, over the top violence and Gore, not for those with a weak stomach, and frequent profanity. #DavidHarbour does an excellent job and plays the role very differently than Perlman did and it has the potential to propel him from TV into a full time movie star. #IanMcShane brings his usual gravitas and presence to the role previously embodied by the late great #JohnHurt, again being smart to not emulate that performance and make this role entirely his own.I feel like this movie is suffering from the same disconnect and out of touch effect that critics had with last year's #Venom. Critics almost universally panned that film while audiences similarly loved it. Every negative review I've read for this so far continually compares it unfavorably to the previous films and many also take issues with the excessive use of violence, Gore and adult language. What did you expect, this is an R Rated film and is thoroughly advertised as such.I hope positive word of mouth from fans makes this successful as they set up some very cool stuff for a potential sequel.If you love these characters like I do, if you love balls to the wall, over the top action horror, please see this film.",Hellboy

There is no room for the ""sheen"" of avenger-esque fandom, it was a dark comic brought to life. Being a darkhorse and image fan. I loved it.
One of if not my favourite film of 2019 Keep rocking Marshall. Everyone who wants the old ones back can suck it, sure Pearlman is the man but this was just.. a heavy flashback reminiscent of robocop or terminator when I was a kid.Just like the new Dredd, Robocop and Into the Spideyverse I say well done, Thankyou for the ride, please, PLEASE continue to do what you do, keep it gritty, THANKYOU.",Hellboy

1369,simonheip,Left after 45 min( 1st time left Cinema),1,13 April 2019,I was pumped to watch this after the trailers but after 45 min I left with having a mild headache. The movie was so out of pace and just to quick. Was like a 10 min editing litrally. The soundtrack was just completely off. There is a scene where Hellboy gets attacked by his own people at a river and the music is like straight heavy-rock/dub-step. It was so crindgy and after another fight scene with 3 massive giant. Heavy rock which was all too much and over pushed. I tried to watch more but also the acting was just so bland. B actors and acting. A complete B movie,Hellboy

1376,wabuckles,"A few things I hoped for, a ton of what I was afraid of.",4,12 April 2019,"I love the Hellboy comics, the novels, the short stories, all of it. Hands down my favorite comic book character ever written, and not likely to change.They got a few things right, fair credit where its due. The Hellboy in Mexico story was spot on and well done, Daimio and Gruagach were both fairly accurate, and the Baba Yaga's chicken leg house was just about perfect. They NAILED the Osiris Club and the Wild Hunt, which got a huge smile from me.But... Man, the rest of it? Why is Hellboy suddenly at odds with the Professor, who is suddenly a foul-mouthed monster hunter? Why rewrite the details to the origin? Why so dramatically change Alice?The sad fact is that this movie tried to do WAY too much in adapting The Storm and the Fury, which is essentially the climax of the entire Hellboy saga. There are too many moving pieces to that story, too many callbacks to previous stories, and truthfully its way too big a scope to try and cram into one story, even if the script and director were up to the challenge. And unfortunately they were not. The story is all over the place and rushed, the dialogue is really hackneyed in spots, and overall it just ends up a mess.David Harbour really does a great job in making Hellboy his own take on the character, but the script does him no favors in giving him very little room to work. If They ever make another, I do hope they bring him back, because it's clear how much he cares about the character.",Hellboy
1377,frakiur,Not worthy,1,21 April 2019,"Yes, more monsters and very bloody than the others Hellboy movies, fails on trying to be funny by being annoyingly funny, very good actors that don't shine because the story and script lack being entertaining, walked out disappointed.",Hellboy
1378,jgagnon-02880,Give it a try. It's a pretty decent watch.,7,30 August 2019,"Ok so I watched this movie as a skeptic. I loved Ron Perlman as Hellboy and I just could not see the movie without Ron. So I shyed away from traillers and advertising.But tonight I was bored and thought what the heck I'll give it a chance. I have to say,. I am glad I did and I am glad I avoided trailers and the hype, because I think that would have made me less likely to like it.David Harbour does a pretty decent job as Hellboy and adds the humour as well as elements of a whiny teenager.The only thing for me was that the ending was a lttle lacking I felt, but on the whole I liked it hence my rating of 7 out of 10.My advice is to try and put aside any thoughts of Ron Perlman's version and treat it as it is. A new telling of Hellboy. If you are like me and managed to avoid the hype with this one. I reckon you will like it too.",Hellboy
1379,raizrsharp,"Gives clarity to the deluded, deranged and demented with regular ease.",10,29 October 2019,"Hellboy 2019 really lights up the joint like Al Harrington on the interstate. A great movie that knows it ain't as good as the source material, and yet is imaginative and confident enough to really add excitement through a number of unique and well constructed scenes that can always lay claim to have gotten there first ahead of the three million unread novels and nonsensical screenplays that continue to cling like broken pieces of flotsam and jetsam to the muddy banks of the mighty Amazon. All in all, most would agree the movie is not as plot driven or as fluent as the original two films made back at a time when television was too much work, but still. The star of the show is Hellboy and really, who wants to watch the Green Lantern work with Thanos again. Also I gotta say the movie reminds me of some of the great television series that went out on their own terms. Macgyver. The A-Team and Frankie. When the good 'ol scripts from international writers at the end were just and really pumping out from well oiled machinery like Dennis Rodman on the boards. And of course, deadwood cocksucker Ian McShane and resident evil Mila Jovovich perform like the seasoned and professional actors they are, in addition to the talents of David Harbour who really shouldn't be jealous or resentful of the source material, which stands up to this day as a beacon of aspiration for McBain Hollywood gamblers who know art for art's sake will always be beneficial to avid movie users like myself.

1443,jacksonphilbrick,"a good watch, stylish and fast",8,23 April 2019,"The movie certainly deserves a 6.5 or 7, just plain entertainment. my eyes an ears were kept busy the whole time, proper use of the R rating with plenty of gorey set pieces and scenes. go in with an open mind and some THC in your brain people.",Hellboy
1444,defrost-94512,Hollywood needs new writers.,4,11 August 2019,"Just finished watching this movie and I have to say I'm a little disappointed. While the actors obviously did their best their lines were tremendously subpar. The special effects department was also obviously underbudget as well. The only thing that really saved me from completely dropping the flames on this was the deleted scenes. I actually feel sorry for the Queen in the opening scene as she seems much more relatable and willing to engage in peace. 1400 years staring at a box lid obviously did her sanity no favors. While I know that conflict is needed for plot, I would like to see at least one movie have a peaceful resolution.",Hellboy
1445,soroush-09863,METAL Raspberry Awards goes too ....,3,10 April 2020,"Worst movie I have seen in 2019
Don't waste you'r time,too!",Hellboy
1446,aaronfin,I hope all the reviews were wrong,3,20 August 2019,But I was wrong this movie just was off. From the costume to the plot it was all off. I'm not sure what happened but this hellboy is just missing what makes hellboy hellboy,Hellboy
1447,bronco-97490,Not for kiddos,4,25 April 2019,"The movie was ok... but PLEASE do not take your children!! My kids are middle school-aged and they shouldn't have been able to watch it! I wish I had known better.... it was extremely gory and the cuss words were out of control!! The F word was said so many times!! My kids even said it was wayyyy too much! For adults, it was ok.",Hellboy
1448,mikedieling,Del Toro please help 😪,1,4 November 2019,"I'm terribly disappointed in this garbage. I did not expect much, but even that has exceeded my biggest fears. Compared to Del Toro's two films, this is a real failure. Wasted time and money. Why did not you let Del Toro make Part 3 and endow the two very good films with a dignified ending. Please still let Del Toro make part 3 !!!!!",Hellboy
1449,lordzeon,Good,7,26 April 2019,I have seen a lot of negative reviews/remarks about this movie and I don't think deserved it. Dont compare this more to the the orignal as David Harbour has done a really good job. Movie was darker who h i preferred. Dont listen to other people's reviews and make your own opinion.,Hellboy
1450,krismiletic,Soooo badddd,1,22 July 2019,"Don't ever let that movie director make anything else ever! Hell, I wouldn't even let him make a sandwich, how bad it would turn out. I love the Hellboy franchise, but this made me cringe so bad, I will need a plastic surgeon to get my face back. And a new set of eyes... Oh, this is so bad I wanna cry.",Hellboy
1451,paddcomp,No relation to the originals,3,14 April 2019,"With the opening few lines using the f-word unnecessarily and the gore of the blood splats I knew this wasn't a movie based on a good story.
There are so many unnecessary scenes that don't add to the story, added to each fight scene is the same.
I couldn't wait for this movie to end, hard to believe in the current market how such a bad film could be made.
I won't be buying the DVD.",Hellboy
1452,testmonkeyy,Liked it!,8,19 April 2019,Goofy and fun with good effects. I like the new hellboy. Crammed with a little too much lore but still fun. I hope more movies will explore this universe.,Hellboy
1453,cwbatmanisawesome,Amazing movie with a bunch of Easter eggs,10,14 April 2019,"The flim is great I loved the r rating and was not much of a fan of the original movie but I was super hyped for this and it didn't disappoint, it's a great action horror comic I think everyone who like blood and gore should read a d think they should definitely see the flim.",Hellboy
1454,fionnpage,Bad writing,2,4 October 2020,The writting is terrible. Hellboy has to do nothing to find out what he has to do. It's all served to him on a plate. And the Exalaber thing!? Dear lord it is baaaaad! Do not watch! Save yourself the time and frustration. Do not watch.,Hellboy
1455,johnlopez-18358,Falls short at every corner,1,14 August 2019,I would rerelease this movie. Better acting better star better story,Hellboy
1456,rickel-41879,Very underrated.,8,15 April 2019,"I've seen a lot of reviews saying this movie is garbage and some saying it's unwatchable, don't understand it. Very enjoyable and doesn't try to be anything but a fun comic book adaptation. Love the Hellboy character and the Del Toro movies but this one is just awesome. Great acting, gore was amazing and it deserved the R rating. Don't listen to the critic reviews and have fun watching this.",Hellboy
1457,sgkfbk,This movie fails even without considering the originals,3,21 April 2019,"I only gave this movie 3 stars because the scene where Hellboy fights the giants is awesome and dinamic.
Sadly every other thing was catastrophic. The action scenes are hard to follow. The conversation scenes are just all out exposition invasions. But most of the things are never ever explained. The story even forgets some things. So at the end I started to doubt that there was any writing at all.
The characters go nowhere. Hellboy is fun to watch of course but his two sidekicks who we got instead of Abe (for the sake of polcorrectness ofc) are boring and hardly give anything to the story which couldnt have been solved otherwise.",Hellboy
1458,westlifehome,"Wonderful movie , Adventurous, scary , comedy and action",10,10 July 2019,Do not go by the reviews and ratings. This movie is most adventures movie . Scenes and direction also wonderful . Creatures shown in this movie are the hell scariest i have seen specially the baba yaga. Just go for it watch it.,Hellboy
1459,jhuffgunn,Don't expect art,10,12 April 2019,"I really like Hellboy, and liked this movie a lot. I also liked the Del Toro movies, but this movie is more similar to the comics. It has fun action and I enjoyed the ride. CGI wasn't great, but I didn't bother me too much.",Hellboy
1460,bosleyconnor,Troll accounts telling lies,9,10 April 2019,"This film is great, from the CGI, to the blood guts and humour. So many people are going into this movie with the intent of disliking it that they don't give it a chance and it's just immature",Hellboy
1461,thabisonjoko,"It was okay, but there is room for improvement .",5,4 September 2019,"Everything is fine, I just feel as if certain scenes were rushed.",Hellboy
1462,cryptkicker5-1,Better than it needed to be,8,30 December 2019,"This isn't Shakespeare, and it isn't meant to be, but its good, for what it is, an adventure. I certainly hope it gets a sequel.",Hellboy
1463,njv-31528,Reluctantly went and LOVED it!,8,28 April 2019,"Do not go comparing it to Del Torro's vision. Four of us went reluctantly after seeing seeing the low score in here and reading/listening to some really harsh well articulated reviews, so our expectations were low. Let's just say ALL four of us loved it!! Neil Marshall's take on this is a brave slightly rough around the edges, cheesy, gutsy adult comic book horror FUN made to be watched on the big screen. It feels fresh, new and even a little experimental. The film doesn't explain everything to you...it's based on a comic and has a lot of back stories, which the audience can put their imagination to, just like you'd expect in a comic. I hope it's leaving some scenes open for the next episode or even a prequel. Put it this way - I'll be there defending the next film of this Hellboy (with excited anticipation) on his premier night...lets just hope it's as good as this first film!! Think this will have a strong cult classic following in the future.",Hellboy
1464,firstsonxb-12778,An unfortunate disappointment.,1,14 April 2019,"I was really hoping this would just be a fun movie with some cool action and some decent acting. I never expected it to be as good as Del Torro, again, all I was looking for was a good time. This film did not even deliver that. It was mean spirited, ugly, violent and overall a mess. Huge fan of the comics, appreciated the Hellboy in Mexico nod, but overall completely skipable. I know it won't happen, but I wish more than ever that the third Hellboy movie from Del Torro would come out just to finish his trilogy and help me forget this mess.",Hellboy
1465,howelldaniel-12140,GENUINELY ENTERTAINING,10,13 April 2019,"Loved the story. The way they go about making the characters this time had a very dark atmosphere loved the gore it's worth giving a chance it feels like there setting up for a much more expansive universe this time around and I would definitely recommend. I feel like most people will slam this movie because it's a movie from a lower budget studio that's trying to build themselves up....the score this time around was definitely geared for people that like rock
Hopefully this makes room for a bigger better sequel",Hellboy
1466,brunosousamartins,One of the worst movies that I saw in my life,1,23 June 2019,"This title is totally different from other Hellboy movies, its horrible,
meaningless and I regret having seen. Terrible!!!",Hellboy
1467,brentonpharr,Gory aimless mess,1,12 April 2019,"It's a squeemfest. I haven't ever got up and left a movie theater before the movie ended until tonight. Watched at least an hour and finally left. I'm not squeemish but the director must've hoped I was and was trying every scene to throw the guts everywhere with accompanying disgusting sound effects. This movie mostly wants viewers to go ""eww!"" with too-long scenes focused entirely on ""Hey look at this bloody dismemberment, and that one too, and those piles of body parts, and other gross stuff. Hear that muscle fiber tearing and those bones breaking? Yeah that's super gross, huh?"" Ridiculous. I also love Milla Jovovich, and the guy playing Hellboy does a good job. But they couldn't make the movie worth watching by themselves. Quality of CGI was good.",Hellboy
1468,mrsingh-81384,What did I just watch,1,14 August 2019,This whole movie is a mess from start to finish it's the worst one of them all just makes you think what they think before making a movie like hellboy I loved hellboy but this movie has changed my mind about watching any more I am sorry but hellboy hellnooooo,Hellboy
1469,jdoolan,Hilarious,7,28 February 2020,David Harbor did an amazing job of capturing Hellboy's irreverent humour. The casting was spot on. I hope they end up doing the sequel they have so obviously set up. If you are looking for a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously this is the one for you.,Hellboy
1470,legofan-48347,Not as good as anticipated,5,16 July 2019,Didn't really know what was really happening and the characters aren't as connectable as the del torro hellboy,Hellboy
1471,adrian-30539,I have never written a review but I don't understand all the hate,7,12 April 2019,It's a standard story and well worth seeing if your a hellboy fan. I actually prefer this version of hellboy as a character. And the humour is good. The gore is crazy and disturbing at times which is awesome.,Hellboy
1472,zackkrussell,Pretty good,8,19 October 2021,"Honestly if you're looking for some life changing film you're in the wrong place, but if you want a cool action movie with fun lore you're totally bang on. I liked this version of hellboy, with his moral dilemmas and funny one liners, plus the action was great!I don't know why people review all films like they're choosing the best picture winner, they're movies, try to enjoy them.",Hellboy
1473,vanessaanscomb,Embarrassing,1,4 December 2019,"Whomever thought they could ever exceed or live up to the masterpiece created by the combination of Guillermo Del Toro and Ron Perlman must have had a rough childhood of being dropped multiple times, sticking silverware in the electrical socket and walking into walls.

1477,fuzzyndo,Watching a flakes,2,13 April 2019,Maybe this film is a good movie or not I never knew. what I watched yesterday was only a film with all the contents cut. until the end of the film I did not understand the storyline of this film maybe because the important part was cut off while doing film censorship in my country. really regretted I paid to sit and watch film flakes.,Hellboy
1478,AlohaStache,DC Marvel who?,8,13 April 2019,"I rate this better than any DC or Marvel movie. It's dark, it's over the top, it's gory-the blood and gore special effects was amazing. It's like a adult anti-super hero movie filled with Heavy metal music, lots of action that can only be enjoyed on the big screen and adult laced humor. Loved it, lots of gross parts!",Hellboy
1479,ml-03124,Better than the original two,9,26 July 2019,"I am a huge fan of the original two movies, and I don't know what the haters are talking about. Sure, it's different in tone, but is that really such a bad thing?Don't pay attention to the negative reviews. The movie is funny, gory as all hell, and David Harbour does a damn good job.Just because Ron Perlman isn't Hellboy anymore doesn't mean that this movie isn't a good one. It's a movie about a demon from Hell, what did you all expect, a Disney movie?",Hellboy
1480,nourigat,Meh....,3,15 April 2019,"I found it averagely entertaining but quite dull. I enjoyed a few of the actors but man most of those fake British accents we're REALLY bad.
It was a good idea that was poorly pieced together, seemed scattered at times and I was expecting WAAAY more gore and swearing. They should've taken it all the way to rated R like Deadpool. Overall it was kind of boring and the soundtrack was very strange, it did not fit.",Hellboy
1481,xxdragonespixelzxx,Ignore reviews this movie is good.,10,16 July 2019,"Well i guess we wanted hellboy sequel but we have a reboot! this movie is well done and underrated,some scenes are creepy and bad but the movie still good and sick.",Hellboy

1483,raulvazquezbebo,Amazing!,10,16 April 2019,Every part of the movie was great. The movie was very creative and graphics were on point. Do not compare this movie to the previous hellboy. This movie did a good job in not prolonging who hellboy is. The gore was crazy and the f bombs were great.Why not watch it?I waited such a long time since little for another hellboy to come out. This movie was maaaaad fuuuuunnnn to watch. This movie satisfied my taste buds. 👍,Hellboy
1484,arnogbaeten,Abuse of Rated R,3,17 July 2019,"Rating R was ""abused"".. to much gore and blood.. to much f-bombs and bad language.. but it didn't enhance the movie at all..You either are Martin Scorcese and you know how to have a proper Rated R movie or you make it a PG13 movie.",Hellboy
1485,josefpettersson,The perfect hellboy movie,10,10 August 2019,This is the best Hellboy movie to date. It has the upbeat action and the tongue in cheek kind of humor that is crusial to the tone of the hellboy narrative.,Hellboy
1486,ambatoprincess,Completely hate it !,3,29 July 2019,"I was expecting to continue with the last Hellboy movie, same characters, script, it has nothing to do with the one I saw in 2004 ! Pretty much disappointed. What's next ? Hellboy won't get back to be as great as it was ! In conclusion , I didn't like it , and I'm not excited to keep watching the ones in coming! Unless Guillermo del Toro takes this in his hands! Otherwise you will lose tons of fans !",Hellboy

1491,tyrezzie,Great high energy monster-slaughter movie,8,18 April 2019,"I'll start by saying that this movie is lacking in some departments. The graphics/effects aren't the best in some places, the writing is a little strange in some parts, and the directing lacks focus. With that being said though, I still greatly enjoyed this movie and will likely watch it a couple more times. It's fast paced with high energy, interesting story elements, and plenty of monster and demon blood as one would expect from Hellboy. It feels a little rushed and I questioned the directors moves with some parts, but overall, a pretty solid movie.",Hellboy
1492,ormistonsam,Great movie!,8,13 July 2019,"The movie was great people giving it a 1 or 2 star clearly not fans of the comics this is true to that art form very gory, very funny and very entertaining the only thing I'd say it missed the mark on was making me care about the sub characters other than that, I look forward to a sequel.",Hellboy
