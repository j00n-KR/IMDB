0,SnoopyStyle,one emotional gut punch,7,18 June 2020,It's early 19th century England. Carefree 20 year old Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) comes from an upper class family. She befriends lower class girl Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) and tries to set her up with the local vicar Mr. Elton instead of tenant farmer Mr. Robert Martin whom she sees as too low class. She fails to see the reality of the situation and George Knightley (Johnny Flynn).This is a costumed comedy. It's more Brit quirky than laugh out loud funny. There is something within the material which really bothers me. It's the overbearing influence of differentiating the classes. We're supposed to support Knightley's pairing of Harriet and Robert but the reason for the pairing is problematic in today's world. The morality of maintaining the classes is completely flipped around over the last two centuries and that makes the story problematic. I want to root for Knightley's pairing but I hate the reason for it. The purest moral and emotional hit has to be Emma's callous comment to Miss Bates. Those sequences pack a more powerful emotional gut punch than the rest of the movie combined which gets often entangled by the class system. I wish that the movie tied a prettier bow for that thread at the end.,Emma.
1,boblipton,Everybody Wants To Rule The World,5,15 March 2020,"I resisted seeing seeing this movie at first. I have read Jane Austen's novel, and seen three other versions, including Amy Heckerling's funny updating, CLUELESS (1995). Did I need to see another film in which a rich, entitled young woman discovers she does not know how to rule herself, let alone the world?Alas, despite the sumptuous world in which dinner parties with pastry that looks like Wedgewood china abound, with every meal accompanied by impassive servants who are little more than automata to serve one's wishes, Anya Taylor-Joy is Emma. Although she claims her efforts to matchmake are altruistic, her cat-like gaze and syrupy words belie this. It's all self-aggrandizing conceit, and Johnny Flynn as the hectoring Mr. Knightley sees this unerringly.It's the auctorial contempt that sets the unfortunate tone of this entire movie. There is not one major character to admire or root for by the halfway mark, save Rupert Graves and Gemma Whelan. A lot of comedies start out with the lead needing a kick in the pants, and giving it to them. By the halfway mark, however, there should be someone root for. Here, no one seems to make any progress until near the end, when the author recalls that all novels should end with the young women either dead or married, and this is a comedy, for heaven's sake.Visually, the movie is beautiful, and the actors are marvelous. It would have been preferable to have screenwriters who were more sympathetic to Miss Austen's characters. They are not the first children of the wealthy to over-rate themselves, and they won't be the last.",Emma.
2,Prismark10,Emma.,3,5 April 2020,"The latest version of Emma is like the previous one released in the cinema back in 1996.A playful movie of spoilt privileged Emma Woodhouse, a manipulative matchmaker.The self interested young woman who is ultimately humbled as she falls in love herself.It purports to be satirical. Only the modern set Clueless managed to convey the essence of Jane Austen's novel.Maybe this is a difficult book to adapt. I thought despite the sets and production values this Emma was turgid as hell.I thought the 1996 version was a bit boring. This was really boring.",Emma.
3,jboothmillard,Emma,6,29 April 2021,"I'd already seen the Gwyneth Paltrow version of the movie based on the popular book by Jane Austen, I did see the trailer for this new version in cinemas, but obviously coronavirus cancelled the release of it, so I watched it on DVD. Basically, set in Regency-era England, wealthy and beautiful Emma Woodhouse (Golden Globe nominated Anya Taylor-Joy) is seeking a new companion, after her governess Miss Taylor (Gemma Whelan) has married. Emma settles on the younger Harriet Smith (Mia Goth), whose parents are unknown, but she been provided education. Emma later discovers that Harriet has been proposed to by Robert Martin (Connor Swindells). Though claiming she will not interfere, Emma manipulates Harriet into declining Mr. Martin's offer of marriage, much to Harriet's distress. Emma believes that local vicar Mr. Elton (Josh O'Connor) is in love with Harriet and encourages Harriet to spend time with him, despite the warning of Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn) that she should not involve herself. During Christmas, Emma's older sister and Mr. Knightley's younger brother come to visit. After everyone leaves dinner, Emma finds herself alone in a carriage with Mr. Elton, who declares his love for her. Emma promptly refuses him, and Mr. Elton disappears for six weeks, eventually returning with a wife. Meanwhile, Emma is jealous of Jane Fairfax (Amber Anderson), the governess niece of Miss Bates (Miranda Hart), but is entranced by Frank Churchill (Callum Turner), son of Mr. Weston (Rupert Graves). The Westons hold a ball, where Mr. Elton embarrasses Harriet by pointedly refusing to dance with her. She is rescued by Mr. Knightley, who asks her to dance. Emma and Mr. Knightley also dance together, awakening romantic feelings between them. Before Mr. Knightley can speak to her, they are interrupted by Harriet who says that she has fallen in love again; Emma believes Harriet is in love with Frank. Emma again vows not to interfere but manipulates circumstances so that Harriet and Frank may spend more time together. Emma tries to spend more time with Mr. Knightley and is surprised when he repeatedly ignores her. On a picnic with their entire party of social acquaintances, Frank urges them to play a game to amuse Emma, who unthinkingly insults Miss Bates. After the party has disbanded, Mr. Knightley confronts Emma about her behaviour. Humiliated, Emma apologises to Miss Bates, who accepts her apology without question. Frank Churchill's wealthy aunt dies, but the Westons were waiting for her to die, as she was opposed to Frank matching with Jane Fairfax, it is revealed that they were secretly engaged. The Westons had hoped he would marry Emma, who feels guilty having to break the news to Harriet. But Harriet reveals that she is actually in love with Mr. Knightley. Harriet however realises that Emma herself is also in love with Mr. Knightley. Mr. Knightley goes to Emma to comfort her about the news and reveal that he is in love with her and hopes to marry her. Emma is pleased when he suggests marriage but develops a nosebleed when she realises how upset Harriet will be. Interfering one last time, she goes to Mr. Martin to make amends, and Harriet tells Emma she has accepted Mr. Martin's offer of marriage. Harriet also reveals, that as she is old enough, she has found out her father is not a gentleman, but a tradesman who makes galoshes. Emma congratulates Harriet and invites her and her father to her home. Though Emma and Mr. Knightley are very much in love, Emma is distressed at the thought of leaving her father Mr. Woodhouse (Bill Nighy) alone. To accommodate this, Mr. Knightley suggests that he join them. Emma happily agrees, and the two are married. Also starring Angus Imrie (Celia's son) as Bartholomew, Tanya Reynolds as Mrs. Elton, and Myra McFadyen as Mrs. Bates. Taylor-Joy is beautiful, intelligent, and witty with her impeccable British accent, colourful clothes and innocent meddling, Flynn is likeable as the critical but adoring man who is the obvious match for her, and there are terrific comic turns from British talents like Nighy and Hart as goofy eccentrics. I am not going to pretend I understood everything going on, because of its very literary dialogue and the mixing of relationships, but the Regency-era detail is spot on, the use of vibrant colour is splendid, and the makeup and costumes are magnificent, it does feel like a fresh take on the classic story, a most watchable period comedy-drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design. Good!",Emma.
4,studioAT,A good adaptation,7,25 February 2020,"This new adaptation of the classic Jane Austen novel seems to be getting mixed reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.With a good central performance from Anya Taylor-Joy, and good support from Bill Nighy etc, this managed to combine humour with period drama well.Good stuff, in my opinion. I don't know what others wanted/expected.",Emma.
5,CinemaSerf,A cinematic meringue - looks good but nothing much underneath.,6,19 February 2020,"The snag with so much of Jane Austen's works is that they are delicate, intricate and rely on the written word to slowly evolve the characterisations, and therefore the plot. This film makes the ultimate climax to the story as plain as the nose on your face from the get-go. Once we are in on that, it becomes an exercise in damage limitation as our true loves navigate their route to a happy ending. In this respect, though this film is beautiful to look at; the costumes are first rate and the photography in/around England's Gloucestershire country houses is gorgeous - the delivery of the story falls rather flat. It is interesting to see Josh O'Connor and Callum Turner in morning dress; Miranda Hart tries hard as the sort of ""Mother Goose"" figure and it has moments that reflect the comedic nature of the original; but overall it is just a rather pale imitation of the book. It's a good twenty minutes too long and the score is intrusive - even at the most delicate or poignant moments of the film, music frankly interferes with the imagery",Emma.
6,writers_reign,Dress Rehearsal,5,18 February 2020,"This is yet another ""classic"" I have not read - for the record, apart from Shakespeare, who I love, I don't 'do' pre-20th century fiction, which means that names like Eliot, Bronte(s), Thackery, Dickens, Smollet, and, yes, Austen, are just that, names to me and little more. On the plus side I enjoyed the way that half the cast were constantly being dressed by the other half against semi-lavish backgrounds as Bill Nighy phoned it in. I nodded off a couple of times and left little wiser story-wise than when I entered. Apart from that ...",Emma.
7,ferguson-6,a terrific version,7,27 February 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Choosing Jane Austen's beloved 1815 novel for one's feature film directorial debut is an ambitious decision, and one for which photographer Autumn de Wilde proves she is up to the challenge. Ms. de Wilde and screenwriter Eleanor Catton may have added a period to the title to distinguish this version from the 1996 film starring Gwyneth Paltrow, or perhaps it was a personal stamp proclaiming this to be the definitive version. Regardless, coming on the heels of Greta Gerwig's superb LITTLE WOMEN, both films blend a timeless literary classic with contemporary talent and attitude. Additionally, viewers may note some tonal similarities to this and the 2018 hit THE FAVOURITE (for which Oliva Colman won an Oscar).It's one of the finest crafted and most famous opening lines in the history of literature: ""Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her."" The decision to cast mega-talented rising star Anya Taylor-Joy (THOROUGHBREDS, THE WITCH) as Emma provides a level of deliciously wicked entertainment that we can only hope Ms. Austen envisioned. Emma is spoiled and not really very likable, and though she sees herself as an all-knowing matchmaker, her family wealth and social status do little to override the quite common level of immaturity and faux-wisdom associated with her age.For those unfamiliar with the novel, you may experience a slow build-up to connection with the characters ... of which there are many who appear early on and with little introduction. Emma lives in her ""comfortable"" home Hartfield with her father (an offbeat and slyly comical Bill Nighy). Days are spent visiting and being visited by a community of folks who seem to have little to worry about in life other than who might marry whom. When young Harriet Smith (a terrific Mia Goth, A CURE FOR WELLNESS, 2017) comes to live with Emma, Harriet's naivety causes her to easily fall under Emma's matchmaking spell - resulting in some awkward moments and regretful decisions.Interesting characters are everywhere we turn. Mr. Elton (an energetic and riotous Josh O'Connor) is the local vicar who is both amusing (""Inn-O-cence"") and a bit difficult to read, as Emma misinterprets his intentions causing one of the more startling developments. Frank Churchill (a stout and smirking Callum Turner) is initially one of the community's more mysterious characters, and his looks and future holdings make him a desirable catch. Jane Fairfax (Amber Anderson) carries on a nuanced rivalry with Emma, and brings a new dynamic when she visits her chatty and ''try-so-hard"" aunt, Miss Bates (a marvelous turn from Miranda Hart). As viewers we find Miss Bates to be at least as entertaining as Emma herself. Later in the film, Mr. Elton takes a bride (Tanya Reynolds), and her character provides a welcome and unsettling spark at just the right time.Of course, it's Mr. Knightley (played by musician Johnny Flynn, BEAST, 2017) who provides the moral backbone of the story. He seems to be the only one (other than her father) who recognizes the shred of goodness buried within Emma. Mr. Flynn gives a soulful performance, and is responsible for the single most touching scene in the film - a simple gesture of asking for a dance. Beyond that, his verbal sparring with Emma is usually morality based, or at straddling the line between politeness and rudeness. Ms. Taylor-Joy and Mr. Flynn and Ms. Hart are stand-outs in a superb cast that delivers the goods in each and every scene.What makes the Austen novel, and the film, so captivating are the issues of romance, marriage, age, and social status woven into each moment - each dramatic turn laced with comedic undertones. Subtext abounds in every conversation and interaction, and words spoken do not always carry the same message as body language or a glance. To top things off, the film is beautiful to look at. The dreary lighting often associated with period pieces is non-existent, and the costumes and set design are extraordinary. The score from Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer is a perfect fit, and allows us to recall that for the 1996 EMMA, composer Rachel Portman won the Oscar ... the last female to win until this year when Hildur Guonadottir won for JOKER. It should also be noted that the 1995 film CLUELESS with Alicia Silverstone was a modern-day take on the Austen novel, and regardless of the format (or whether there is a period in the title), Emma continues to be ""handsome, clever, and rich.""",Emma.
8,malcolmgsw,Wears out its welcome after 30 minutes,4,17 February 2020,"This initially seemed promising.However after half an hour the film started to drag.Pointless scene followed pointless scene.I sat there hoping for something to happen,but really little did.",Emma.
9,lasttimeisaw,"one can only comment lamentably, all's well that ends well",7,12 May 2020,"""Many eligible bachelors and maidens dwell in Emma's village, and under the impression that she is a born matchmaker after facilitating the knot-tying of her governess and the wealthy widower Mr. Weston (Whelan and Graves), her next goal is Harriet Smith (Goth), a young girl of obscure lineage, yet, Emma deems the tenant farmer Robert Martin (Swindells) is below Harriet's status (a classist prejudice that Emma is apparently oblivious to), in lieu, she tries to pair Harriet with the seemingly convivial local vicar Mr. Elton (O'Connor), to the obvious objection of George Knightley (Flynn), the brother of her brother-in-law, that the outcome leaves Harriet heartbroken and prompts Mr. Elton to a swift marriage with a girl hailed from elsewhere.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Emma.
10,MOscarbradley,Austen the way Austen should be done.,8,20 February 2020,"The cast are perfection, the settings sublime and the social observation is as 'Austen' as any Austen I've seen. Yes, this new version of ""Emma"" is really quite wonderful and I would venture to say even a step up on the 1996 Douglas McGrath version. My only real quibble is that Anya Taylor-Joy, fine as she is, can't quite match Gwyneth Paltrow. Otherwise, what's not to love; a Knightly who isn't too suave or too handsome, (Johnny Flynn, splendid), a Frank Churchill who actually is something of a charmer and nowhere near as obnoxioous as he's often painted, (an excellent Callum Turner), and a gorgeously obsequious Mr. Elton from Josh O'Connor who just about walks off with the film while director Autumn de Wilde, (love that name), keeps it very nicely in period , (none of those little post-modern nods that now seem to be common in pictures of this kind). I also loved her use of English folk song on the soundtrack but this was just the icing on a very sweet cake. This is Jane Austen the way Jane Austen should be done.",Emma.
11,inkblot11,Gorgeous new adaptation of the classic Austen work; make time for it,10,2 July 2020,"Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy) is the fortunate daughter of Mr. Woodhouse (Bill Nighy) in jolly olde England. Now over eighteen, she has rejoiced in making a match for her former governess and watching them be happily married. It all goes to her head and she decides the best way to occupy her time is to make matches for all the unmarried folk around the area where she lives. Her brother-in-law, Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn) tries to warn her against this, especially when she turns her attentions to a young lady Miss Smith, who lives at a boarding house and has an unknown background. Indeed, Emma has encouraged Harriet Smith to turn down a man truly in love with the lass, Mr. Martin, and set her cap for the vicar, Mr. Elton. This upsets Mr. K greatly as he knows Mr. Martin well and believes it would have been not only a match of love but of equals. In due time, Mr. Elton seems to pay attention to Harriet but there may be an ulterior motive. Around the town, Emma also makes mistakes with old friends she finds boring and the secrets of the Weston family, where her former governess is now the lady of the house. Thus, Mr. Knightley is quite severe on Emma at times and tries to keep her out of trouble. Could it be that Mr. K himself as a secret love for someone? This absolutely gorgeous new version of Austen's timeless classic is a great pleasure to behold. What fantastic sets, costumes, and art direction! Your eyes will nearly fall out of your head at its opulence. The cast is mostly unknown but quite fine; Taylor-Joy brings Emma to life with gusto. My only quibble is Mr. Flynn doesn't measure up to my expectations; he's not handsome enough and doesn't have the polish Jeremy Northam had in an earlier version. There is quite a surprising scene or too, with a gentleman's naked backside revealed! Nevertheless, no matter how many times you have seen this story on film or re-read the book, this stunning new addition has earned the right to be considered one of the best.",Emma.
12,westsideschl,Nudity! Oh My ...,7,21 May 2020,"Reasons to dislike, per other reviews: 1. Brief backside nudity. 2. Odd choice of mismatched music, both foreground & background. 3. Doesn't follow the book.
Reasons to like: 1. If the brief, admittedly pointless, scene of nudity bothers you then you must have been born & raised always fully clothed. 2. Music was odd, but so was the story. 3. Often said, per some unknown rule, when text is interpreted into ""moving pictures"" that they are to be both creative & mechanistically identical.
My complaint is that I had to sit through an hour+ of someone who reminded me of a current political leader, i.e. vain, arrogant, selfish, controlling. The only things lacking were vague repeated exaggerations like ""very very"".",Emma.
13,UniqueParticle,"Lovely all around, I'm baffled this got hate!",8,25 October 2020,"Beautiful period piece with love and charm throughout! So delightful the way everything is set up, I love Anya Taylor Joy she's a wonderful actress in any project. Elegance of great magnitude and tranquillity. Emma deserves better/more appreciation; I'm barely a fan of period pieces but this is definitely among the best.",Emma.
14,Red-125,A 21st century film pretending to be a 19th century film,5,15 November 2020,"Emma. (2020) was directed by Autumn de Wilde. Jane Austen's novel was published in 1815. Two hundred years later, the novel still is wonderful. (OK--not Jane Austen's best novel, but still wonderful.)Emma can be successfully transformed into a movie, but this isn't that movie. Director de Wilde is experienced, but primarily in TV. Anya Taylor-Joy, who portrays Emma Woodhouse, is red hot right now, as the star of The Queen's Gambit. Playing Emma will prove to Hollywood that she has a broad range of talents. Well, that was the game plan, but it didn't work. She's definitely a 21st Century woman, dressed up in 19th Century costumes.In the novel Mr. Knightley is much older than Emma. Johnny Flynn who portrays Mr. Knightley in the movie is, indeed, much older than Emma, but he looks like her contemporary. I'm sure that he's glad that he's so youthful looking, but it doesn't work in this movie.Bill Nighy, who plays Mr. Woodhouse is an outstanding actor, but he too is miscast. In the novel, Mr. Woodhouse worries about everything, not just drafts as portrayed in the movie. Nighy is calm and steady--he doesn't adapt to the role of the dithering Mr. Woodhouse.An actor who deserves praise is Amber Anderson, who portrays Jane Fairfax In the film. Anderson performs the third movement from Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 12 on the fortepiano and she's not dubbed! This is even more of an astounding accomplishment, because Anderson normally plays the piano. She had to relearn the piece on the pianoforte, which is a similar--but not identical--instrument.The soundtrack of the movie is unusual. Director de Wilde has chosen some wonderful folk music performed by outstanding folk artists. However, the songs on the soundtrack were played with no apparent relationship to what we were seeing on the screen. It's almost as if de Wilde reached into a bag of songs and threw whatever she happened to find into the soundtrack in a random fashion. Very strange.If you are a Jane Austen superfan, you may want to see this version of Emma for the sake of completeness. Otherwise, I would avoid it. Emma. has a weak IMDb rating of 6.7, but I didn't think it was that good, and rated it 5.",Emma.
15,pennyelenabooks,Good Enough,6,18 February 2020,"Emma was a delightful movie based on Jane Austen's book. The main lady was dominating the film, being snobby and melding in everyone's affairs and especially her friend's. The performances were good and the costumes spot on. Emma's father was pretty funny too. The romance was nicely presented, although the male leads weren't that charming as to be alluring and to make Emma fall for them. But, overall, it was nice.",Emma.
16,matthewssilverhammer,"Slow Burn, but great",8,25 November 2020,"Reads like an Emma adaptation made by people who grew up loving Clueless. This version is incredibly romantic, which may be the strongest argument for it being better than, or at least qualitatively comparable to, Clueless...that, and its sheer handsome beauty. Turns out I'm a person who loves well-shot costume dramas, where the script is as opulent as the visuals. Even made me wanna read some Austen...no small feat.",Emma.
17,marmar-69780,emma,7,19 February 2020,"Emma is film that is very nice watch and i had a good time experiencing it,this film has maybe a pretty slow story going and plot is very artistic and old fashioned and that can be to much for people who were hoping for a fast moving plot,but in the end i was satisfayed with final project,anya did a good job as a lead character and she was my main reason to watch this film since she is one of best young actresses out there,emma also did a good job at worldbuilding and exploring world around them,lets not forget also that costumes and dresses are very good designed and very nicely to look at,i dont know how the book and movie measure up,but emma was a good film to watch",Emma.

20,robfollower,Emma. - Review,9,18 February 2020,"It is nice to see both Emma. and Little Women adapted in a meaningful manner by directors who just seem to... get it.Emma. is one of the funniest Austen adaptations I have ever seen-humor being mostly missing from film and TV adaptations of her work. Despite the original novels being intended to satire Regency society, a lot of adaptations decide, oddly, to play their stories straight. The strength of Emma. isn't in how it diverges from the source material; it is what has been found within the pages of the novel. A sharp script and charming performances have allowed for this Austen adaptation to make me laugh out loud at points; an accomplishment for dialogue that is, mostly, a few hundred years old giving it a timeless and intelligent quality.The cast are superbly matched to their roles: whether it's Anya Taylor-Joy as the sharply intelligent and proud Emma, Johnny Flynn as the thoughtful and compassionate Mr Knightley, Bill Nighy as the ever complaining father or Miranda Hart as the chatty and sweet Miss Bates. Everyone is perfectly matched to their role.The film's ultimate strength is in the absolute gorgeousity dripping from its costuming and set design. With pastel palettes and perfect symmetry, with every frame feeling like a period-appropriate master painting. This, mixed with strong performances and a charming screenplay , wonderful soundtrack allows for a film that is a delight to watch. I am finding it difficult to lend more words to my absolute enjoyment of the film. 9/10",Emma.
21,alindsay-al,A Below Average Boring Period Drama,4,19 February 2020,"I must admit this was not a film I thought I would be seeing this week but a family member managed to convince me to see Emma so this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a young woman attempt to meddle with other peoples love life while craving to be an independant woman.
Main Character
Anya Taylor-Joy is a really great actress probably known for her great performance in Split and her role in the sequel Glass. She does fit the role of Emma very well for sure, she has the look of a period drama actress and she has the acting ability to pull off the lead in this role. But the problem was with the character of Emma herself, she is just rather unlikeable, yes I understand that this was the point of the film but never in this film did I care about her, root for her or feel sympathy for her even though the film really wants you too.
Supporting Characters
Johnny Flynn plays the main supporting role in the film and he is very good in this film, one aspect of the film I did like was his chemistry with Joy and how the two characters clashed a lot and he basically calls her out for her flaws as he is the only character that does this in the film. Billy Nighy has a role in the film and he is basically the comic relief in the film with very little character, still he was entertaining in his role and it is nice to see him in this role as I haven't seen Nighy in much recently. There are plenty of other characters in this film, probably a few too many but none of them are particularly interesting I just didn't care about any of them ore there plights because for the most part Emma didn't seem to care and that's who we see the film through.
Story
This film is based on the book written by Jane Austen, so I expected at least an interesting narrative in the film and some depth to the characters but I just didn't find it in this film, nothing really happens in this film. The plot moves at a snails place and just focuses on the romance storylines but doesn't look past that and try and make the story more interesting. Plus I know it is based on material but this film is really predictable, the film ended exactly as I expected and there was nothing to suprise or interest me here.
Script
The script has some funny moments and dialogue which does work but it is not good enough to carry this film as a comedy but the film doesn't have good enough dramatic dialogue to make this anywhere close to a drama. This means there was some okay moments but not enough to flesh out the characters or make them funny.
Style
Now this is a period drama, so this film looks great. All the costumes and designs are top notch, a big compliment to the people who worked on this aspect of the film because it felt very authentic. However, this films tone is never properly defined, apparently it is meant to be a comedy but it isn't that funny so it fails there. Also the pacing of the film, the film is 2 hours long but I swear feels like double that, I was so bored I cannot explain.
Overall
Overall, if you like period dramas you might like this film but to me it is just a boring film that is just not worth a watch.",Emma.
22,kwenchow,"This is not a comedy film! Too long, slow, and not laughable! Bored to freaking death!",1,12 May 2020,"This film start with a young girl ""Emma"" choosing a flower to sent to a woman ""Miss Taylor"", and she attend Miss Taylor wedding ceremony scene! As turnout, this film is a love story of Emma and her friend ""Harriet""! Entire film full of boring conversation! The overuse of the song singing at the background scene, also make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Jane playing piano, after the singing perform by Emma! At the end, Harriet marry with Robert Martin, and Emma marry with Mr. Knightley! That's it! Another disappointed film!",Emma.
23,henry8-3,Emma,6,22 December 2020,"Austen's England and Emma (Taylor-Joy) is a beautiful, wealthy and selfish know it all devoting her time to ill conceived match making - currently for her friend (Goth).Beautifully conceived and wittily put together. The thing with Austen is not how things are going to work out, which is largely obvious, but the fun we're going to have watching the lead find Redemption and get her man in the end. Taylor-Joy does well in the lead, with good support from Goth, Hart and Nighy great fun as Emma's father, obsessed with cold drafts - not wholly convinced by Flynn if I'm honest. Sweet",Emma.
24,Pairic,Good Comedy of Manners/Class,8,18 February 2020,"Emma: A new adaptation by Director Autumn de Wilde work from a script by Elanor Catton takes the Comedy of Manners/Drama road. Class is all important, to keep Emma's life on track a pyramid of servants is essential. Even when Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy) is picking flowers for her departing governess (Gemma Whelan) she requires the assistance of a footman and maid. Her father (Bill Nighy) needs two servants to detect draughts and move screens for him. Even the younger males like George Knightley (Johnny Flynn) have valets to dress them from head to foot.Emma's matchmaking entangles her in all sorts of mishaps as she misinterprets signals and her schemes to form unions between people of the right sort for them crumble into chaos. Knowing ones place is all important but so is noblesse oblige. A lesson she learns when she encounters the Godotesque (and cruel) Frank Churchill when he finally arrives.

25,masonfisk,EMMA...AGAIN...?,7,28 April 2021,"Another year passes & we have another version of Jane Austen's Emma, this one from 2020 & starring hot actress du jour, Anya Taylor-Joy. Joy is the consummate matchmaker who has her fingers in various emotional pies w/none in her own but her current eye is on a young lass, played by Mia Goth, who figures she has the perfect mate for her, but if you know the story, the know-it-all is way off base. Having not seen the story on film since the 1996 version starring Gwyneth Paltrow (which I remembered liking a great deal) w/a BBC version starring Romola Garai (on HBO Max, end of commercial) but my go to is Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone which is a reworked version of Emma done by Amy Heckerling which when watching this new take I kept back cataloguing whenever the verbose dialogue got to be too much, this ""Cliff's Notes"" version helped me along. There is a lot of great production design here & the use of pastel colors is striking (some rooms painted blue or yellow are gasp inducing) & director Autumn De Wilde (a former CD cover designer & music video director) integrates the look & sound (a lot of period ditties are heard on the soundtrack) perfectly giving the film a classy yet approachable feel.

Zero expectations going in and honestly I was really surprised with how well it worked.Emma. manages to really do something that I think a lot of other period pieces like it have failed to do in that it really makes everything seem so similar to modern life while at the same time holding true to the period it draws from and in doing so runs these wonderful parallels that are such a unique thing to see. It's beautiful to look at, all the performances felt on the money.My only big knock was that it felt MUCH longer than it's two hour run time. There came a point where I started looking at my much and couldn't help but ask just how long this thing was?! To then discover it's just two hours was a real surprise. Admittedly the long day I'd had may have played into that but all the same it felt like it dragged out. Besides that, this whole thing, the ""Clueless for this Generation"" idea, it doesn't do much for me. I never really connect with these movies for whatever reason. I can acknowledge the obvious skill involved they just fail to resonate with me.In short, Emma. is a very solid movie, a surprisingly well done film that, aside from some minor pacing issues is likely to be a home run for a lot of people that give it a chance. I, sadly, am going to end up in the minority there but even so it's hard not to at least like this. It's absolutely worth watching, worth renting even if that's how you have to do it.",Emma.
27,valleyjohn,Anya Taylor-Joy IS Emma.,8,21 June 2021,"I've never read a Jane Austen book and I'm unlikely to .The thought of watching ( or reading )the love lives of British aristocracy send a dull chill through me but Emma Just goes to show that any preconceived ideas can be broken thanks to some great acting and a good director.Beautiful, smart and wealthy, Emma Woodhouse navigates her way through misguided matches, romantic missteps and the challenges of growing up -- all to finally realize the love that has been there all along.There is something mesmerising about Anya Taylor-Joy . I recently watched her in the Netflix show Queens Gambit where she absolutely steals every scene . This is no different.Her eyes are hypnotic and her understated looks tell a story beautifully.There is also a great cast around her . Johnny Flynn , who is used to playing the bit of rough , it superb as Mr Knighley and who doesn't live watching Bill Nighy ?The whole etiquette thing is fascinating. From the dancing to the way they eat . It was certainly a different world in 1800.I really enjoyed this despite its predictably and who knows , perhaps I'll watch more films based on Jane Austen novels ?",Emma.
28,masonsaul,Great period drama,8,26 February 2020,"Emma. is a great period drama that's extremely eccentric, fun and charming. Anya Taylor-Joy is great as Emma and Johnny Flynn is also great. Bill Nighy, Miranda Hart, Mia Goth and Josh O'Connor are all really good. Autumn de Wilde's direction is fantastic and the film is beautiful throughout. The costumes are amazing and the music by Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer is excellent. It's also consistently funny although this undercuts the emotion in a couple of scenes.",Emma.
29,TheOneThatYouWanted,The trailer is better,4,2 January 2021,The trailer for this film makes it look like an intelligent highbrow fluffed cloud of charm.

30,jadepietro,"A ""Period"" Comedy of Ill-Manners",6,6 November 2020,"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Charmless but pretty.JIM'S REVIEW: Emma. (without the period) has been a continued source of pleasure for the fans of Jane Austen. Many film and television series adaptations of her novel about this strong-willed independent heroine has been done, the best still being the Gwyneth Paltrow film in 1996. This recent addition lacks the wit and comic misadventures. Charm is also a missing factor in this mostly miscast but somewhat entertaining version.For those unfamiliar with the story, rich Emma Woodhouse plays matchmaker to her friend, Harriet, with disastrous results while avoiding matrimony and love herself. The story is a sharp commentary on romantic relationships in the 1800's and the social class structure of England. Emma's meddlesome nature provides the satire and female empowerment viewpoint of a wealthy heiress who flits away the days manipulating those in her circle. The film does depict this aspect with confidence.Directed with no real flair by Autumn de Wilde, the main issue is the screenplay by Eleanor Catton. It follows the novel's intricate plot efficiently but loses all the comic entanglements and interrelationships of her characters in the process. As adapted, these characters are lacking depth and never carry the effervescent needed for this comedy of manners. The film looks lovely, with fine cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt and especially lavish period costumes created by Alexandra Bryne.Perhaps the main problem is a central casting issue. In the title role, Anya Taylor-Joy is joyless. She captures Emma's spoiled lifestyle and pettiness well, but is dead weight with her comic timing and charm. She seems to have a perpetual pout throughout the film. Showing no charisma opposite her is her love interest, George Knightley. As played by Johnny Flynn, the character is in need of more dash and vigor. He is bland as white bread, barely a scone either. Most of the other cast members add little excitement to their stock roles. Only Miranda Hart and Mia Goth seem to have a screen presence. Even the talented Bill Nighy is wasted as Emma's doting father.Emma. is a nice try at bringing this period comedy to a modern day audience. (Clueless (1995) actually did a better job with that approach.) However, that little period does signals the updated nonsense and sensibilities of this mishandled remake. You just can't make something work without the right chemistry between the two mismatched pair of actors in the lead roles, despite all the sumptuous trappings that surrounds them. Period.",Emma.
31,richard-1787,I thought it would never end,4,13 March 2020,"This movie is beautiful to look at. The shots of the English countryside, the beautiful homes, the costumes. Some of the actors are even even easy on the eyes, especially Anya Taylor-Joy, the Emma, who is also a fine actress, and really creates a character.And then there is the plot, such as it is, and the dialogue, which may come directly from Austin's novel. I don't know. Nor do I care. It's supposed to be clever. To me, it was just flat. Perhaps it was the dialogue itself, perhaps it was the way it was delivered.Go back and watch the Pride and Prejudice from 1940, with Greer Garson et al., directed by Robert Z. Leonard, with a script by Aldous Huxley. That's brilliant. I've watched it I don't know how many times, and it still holds me.This movie, on the other hand, had me begging for it to be over. I just did not care about any of the characters. Except the husband of the other daughter, Emma's brother-in-law. He suffered mightily, so I understood him.",Emma.
32,rannynm,A Cheerful Adaptation of Jane Austen's Beloved Novel.,8,20 February 2020,"Emma is a cheerful adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved novel. Readers of Jane Austen can rejoice as her characters come to screen. Others might not find this to be their cup of tea.In this adaptation the ""handsome, clever and rich"" matchmaker Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor Joy) pursues her adventures through matches and romanticism to find love.Anya Taylor Joy, as Emma, gives the best performance. Anya has grown from a being newcomer and this demanding performance proves that, allowing for eloquent speaking and characterization. Her conversations with other characters are straight out of the classic Victorian tale; keeping in mind, she is American. Her love interests are Johnny Flynn as Mr. Knightley, a dashingly critical friend, and Callum Turner as Frank Churchill, a rich gentleman. I also enjoyed Mia Goth as Harriet, as she helps Emma find her match.Director Autumn de Wilde is artistic, but the pacing could be tighter. This is a slow movie as several scenes are long, drawn-out conversations. I feel this aspect is best achieved in books, though some movies can capture the audience's attention like that. This movie really must be your forte for it to be enjoyable. The character's parlance is always olden English, and there is a loss of stakes. The score by Isobel Waller-Bridge is authentically Georgian capturing the grounded roots of genteel women living in England.The message of this film is to not rush love, as Emma and Harriet let time prove its worth after hasty pursuits. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 18, due to brief nudity, even though younger kids might not be interested in watching this.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST!

33,martimusross,Entertaining Movie But Not Emma By Jane Austen,6,15 February 2020,"EmmaI am torn between liking the movie for what it is or reviewing this with regard to its authenticity with the novel or indeed by comparison to other visual interpretations over the years.Either way there were some distinct problems with this production and indeed some total joys.What was goodWe had some brilliant cameos that upped this movie and were quite memorable, Miranda Hart for one.The styling was spot on in terms of the clothes, hair, makeup and interiors.What was deeply problematicWhat separates Jane Austen from Barbara Cartland, obvious, her brilliant use of language to poke fun at a society of manners and the rigid conventions of her time and thereby reveal some insights into the human condition. This production was unfortunately Barbara Cartland, Georgian ""speak"" was largely absent in the first 45 minutes, the script was heavy and there was just no lightness of touch in recreating the interchange between Knightly and Emma. I would suggest everyone can understand Georgian speak as with Shakespearean speak and if they can't they best man up or leave the theatre, we cannot dumb down the language of these great authors without it ceasing to be their work.Emma is a flawed heroine, Jane Austen said ""no one could like her except herself"", but we must love her despite her shortcomings, she is well meaning, but her reading of the world and her errors in judgement come from inexperience, the gap between these realities is revealed by Knightly and it is this that defines the manners and conventions of the day, whether just or not. In this movie she just appeared an interfering busybody and we didn't like her, her motivations were merely suggested to be vanity, not true!Mr Woodhouse was really presented as a caricature but in the novel he was less comedic and more irritating pedant, in many ways, as F.R.Leavis argues, it is his influence and indulgence that has created the monstrous errors in judgement that Emma makes.We just were not rooted in the Georgian period, the score was wrong, the script was wrong, everything was too clean even on the farm. The set pieces, the balls, the picnic was all clumsily handled, such a shame. I did enjoy the piano recital scene that was good.We have had in recent months Liitle Women, David Copperfield and now Emma, of the three Little Women was the best. But overall all three are an unmitigated disaster as they failed to capture the essence of the great novels from which they derived, in all it is not just the story that needs to be conveyed but the larger insights into humanity and the interactions between us all. If you want a new story then write one, never butcher a great masterpiece for either accessibility or political reasons. No more please!",Emma.
34,rivertam26,Somewhat entertaining but nothing new,6,2 April 2020,I really wanted to love this. I was a big fan of the Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love) version. I love Clueless and I'm a big fan of Anya Taylor Joy (Split). And I did enjoy it I just feel like it didn't do much that gave it much of it's own personality. That being said there's a lot of fun here. Anya Taylor Joy is great in the lead and Bill Nighy is solid as her father. The other players don't command much attention and mostly its business as usual. The movie is colorful and the cinematography is bright and delicate. I just wish the movie didn't take itself as seriously because it could have used a winking eye.3.25/5,Emma.
35,Jeremy_Urquhart,"I'm not the target audience, but...",4,27 February 2020,"I saw this. I'm not going to say it's the worst thing I've ever seen. And I'm going to be upfront and honest by saying that this is not really my kind of movie (although last year's Little Women was great, surprisingly so). BUT: I try to review every movie I have solid to strong feelings about, whether those feelings are generally good or generally not so good. And while I don't think Emma will be an underwhelming experience for everyone, I'm going to do the best I can to explain why it didn't work for me. If other people find enjoyment in it, or if other people even find themselves loving it, that's perfectly fine. I don't want to dissuade anyone from seeing this if they were already interested. Take my words with a massive grain of salt, or like, hundreds and hundreds of regular-sized grains of salt. My thoughts on this movie are just something I have to get out, and write down, and that's just what I do. So I apologise in advance if what I say irks you or completely goes against your own opinion.So I don't really like Jane Austen. If I haven't lost you by now, that'll probably do it. Again, her works aren't for someone like me, from what I can tell. Pride & Prejudice was one book we had to study back in high school, almost a decade ago for me now. I didn't finish it, couldn't stand what I read, and wrote a scathing critique on how dull and not really feminist by today's standards it was, and it ended up one of my best marked essays throughout all of high school. Maybe I argued my point well, or maybe it was just good by 16-year-old standards. I don't want to make any points so bold about this film adaptation of Emma. However, I do want to note that I did go into it with an open mind. It's been close to a decade since angry teenage me got tired of reading Pride & Prejudice and decided to rant about the 40-50 pages of material I did manage to get through. I'd heard this new adaptation of Emma was decent, and I've always liked Anya Taylor-Joy (she's definitely going places, although that was already pretty obvious by now). So I had an open mind, was hoping maybe I'd be open more to a Jane Austen work at the ripe old age of 25, and...I didn't come away very enthusiastic at all. My main problem- one that again, I'm sure not everyone will have- is that this story just seems so pointless. Especially now: I was sitting there wondering why we needed a movie like Emma right now? I didn't know what it had to say, I didn't know what it could teach anybody, I didn't see how it was relevant to the issues and themes that are currently on people's minds. It makes me think that maybe this is escapism: that it's a light, frivolous movie without too many stakes that people can enjoy in a comfortable cinema for two hours on a weekend, or the evening after a hard day at work. My problem there then becomes admittedly an even more subjective one: to my own tastes, this just isn't entertaining. This isn't a fun movie to me. The humour is so mild and polite that I was genuinely puzzled most of the time when the audience around me laughed. There didn't seem to be any clever subversions, or critiques, or real satire of the upper class. It was just people in mildly embarrassing situations, or Bill Nighy looking endlessly bewildered whenever someone did something a little bit pretentious. Drama? Barely any of that to me either. It's not difficult to work out where the movie is going, and when it starts to get a little serious in its less humourous final third, the drama is so petty and so easily resolved that I just wondered how anybody could get invested enough to care.I don't know why I get so annoyed at something that clearly is very mild, but I couldn't help thinking that every single person watching in that cinema would have had something more interesting that's happened in their life, compared to what was unfolding on the screen. Everybody has a funnier personal story, everybody has likely experienced more tragedy, everybody has had more of an emotional rollercoaster at some point in their lives that would make for a more gripping, more cinematic experience. Emma is largely about a group of (mostly very wealthy) people dealing with what are ultimately very small, insignificant struggles. We don't get the sense that most will be much worse off at all by the film's end should things not work out for them. The title character acts a certain way throughout much of the movie without much of an explanation, beside literal text taken from the novel shown right before the film starts. And when she inevitably shifts her feelings and outlook on life, it's both predictable and also somewhat out of left field. I didn't get a strong or satisfying sense of progression or development out of her character.If the film overall was funnier, it wouldn't need to be dramatic. If it were more dramatic, it wouldn't need more than a couple of funny Bill Nighy looks every now and then. If it had something to say, or something it wanted to critique, or a way of exploring something relevant or thought provoking, I could forgive it for not being particularly engaging in a funny or dramatic manner. If it had some amazing performances, or some absolutely stunning visuals, then I could recommend it in that regard, but technically it's really just competent. Taylor-Joy is good but she just about always is. Nighy is funny at times but he just about always is. The film looks nice enough but it's got so much going on with its costumes and period sets and colours that that's just about inevitable.I haven't really ripped into a movie that's technically not terrible before, but for the most part, watching this movie and just knowing that it exists in place of other more interesting work that the filmmakers and cast could have been working on bothers me. Based on my past experience of not liking Pride & Prejudice, I am fully aware that this might just not be for me, and it could well be as simple as that. But my feelings are strong, and so I've done my best to explain them. This felt like a big nothing of a movie that while technically competent, for me personally doesn't say anything insightful or new, doesn't evoke any emotions, doesn't entertain, and doesn't absolutely wow me on a visual level. It's such a nothing of a movie for me, but hey, if you've got this far and were already set on seeing it as an Austen fan, don't let my rant stop you. There are movies I love that aren't particularly thought provoking or dramatically original, but are enjoyable as basic entertainment for me personally. Emma could well entertain others in a similar way, but for me at least, I genuinely did not feel that way.",Emma.
36,muamba_eats_toast,Surprisingly perfect,10,3 March 2020,I'm not usually a fan of period films nor am I an avid reader of Jane Austen yet everything in this film just clicked perfectly the time flew by i was having so much fun and if anything I was left wanting it to carry on rather than end. A truly magnificent film.,Emma.
37,maurice_yacowar,brilliant retelling of Jane Austen's novel,10,10 March 2020,"The music provides a telling structure in Autumn de Wilde's adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. In particular, there's a difference between the music that originates within the narrative - i.e., the songs and music performed by the characters within the plot - and the outside music - i.e., the score that frames the narrative. The outer reflects upon the inner. This strategy points to the drama's central concern with the class structure, its privileges and its responsibilities.
The internal music is classical, whether symphonic or traditional lyricism. That is, it represents the upper middle class - better educated, richer, in short, privileged - which the wealthy and beautiful Emma rules with her assumed sense of power.
Arguably the key song is the Knightley/Fairfax duet of ""Drink to me only with thine eyes,"" a period re-setting of the Elizabethan Ben Jonson's ""To Celia."" Popular in Jonson's day, it's classical in Austen's (and in ours, as even Johnny Cash has visited it with gritty ardour).
In addition to the charm of its performance, the song serves a key thematic function. It initially suggests the singers' romantic pairing. This is what Emma assumes, while she nurses the romantic possibility of the mysterious Frank Churchill. Ms Fairfax has already trumped Emma with a brilliant piano solo that outshone Emma's song. But we eventually learn Fairfax and Churchill have long been engaged. Emma and Knightley happily graduate from their compulsive antagonism into love.
The ironies around this performance of the Jonson song undermine Emma's confidence in her own judgment, especially as she contrives marital matches. Also, as the song portends, it is through their eyes - fixed upon each other as they dance - that the, climactic love between Knightley and Emma takes hold.
Their dance is a pairing within a collective dance. Their intimate harmony is thus a part within a larger group harmony. This contrasts to the other pairings that would challenge the social order, like Emma's plan to join Harriet, the woman of unknown (hence inferior) origins, to the respectable but ludicrous Mr Elton (a prospect he indignantly, snobbishly rejects) and Harriet's subsequent design upon Knightley.
In contrast, the songs that frame the narrative from outside are traditional folk tunes, i.e., the songs of the lower class. That is, this drama of the upper class is framed by, set in the context of, the life and liveliness of the lower class, the ever-present but ignored servants and farmers.. This is the music of the good Mr Martin, the farmer whose appropriate engagement to Harriet Emma thwarts, presuming for her companion to marry above her station. As her governess did.
Their intimate service is exemplified when a servant puts the bare forked Knightley into trousers. Otherwise Knightley is the film's moral center because he respects and attaches to the working class. In his noblesse oblige, he feels responsible to the class that serves him. He spurns the carriage to travel the countryside on foot. He properly criticizes Emma for thoughtlessly insulting the social inferior, Mrs Bates. He gallantly - a Knightley in shining armour - rescues Harriet by asking her to dance after Elton has flagrantly rejected her. His love ultimately redeems Emma.
When Emma is twice forced to apologize to her social inferiors in both cases it is by generous visits. To pay her new respect to Mrs Bates Emma brings her a basket of flowers. Her very appearance is her apology, as Mrs Bates gratefully resumes praising Emma's goodness, glossing over her evident hurt. To Mr Martin Emma brings another basket, with a generous goose, and an encouraging articulation of her regret for having interfered with his proposal to Harriet. Harriet and Mr Martin eventually rush to each other with the unbridled enthusiasm of a village ditty.
In song as in life, the upper middle class may have the polish but the lower has the energy.",Emma.
38,thekarmicnomad,I haven't read the book,6,2 April 2020,"I am a long way from the target demographic of this film; but I do love the tree main versions of Pride and Prejudice (BBC, Knightly and Zombies)This film is enjoyable enough but it feels a lot longer than it is.
The first third feels like nothing is going on, everyone is constantly in transit or getting dressed.When thing start to happen and romance and social faux pas hit the fan then I really got into this.All the performances were good and the characters interesting.
I am not a big Miranda fan but I really liked the part she played in this.The one element that everyone seems to agree with on here is the one thing I didn't like.
The filming is so bright!

My girlfriend assures me that everything in Victorian times was very colourful and vibrant.

39,rockman182,Emma. (2020),8,22 February 2020,"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich. I recently watched the 1996 version with Gwyneth Paltrow in the leading role to get an idea of the story of the film going into this one. I love Anya Taylor-Joy so much. I've seen every one of her films apart from Marrowbone. I was so excited to see her in yet another period piece but this time in a sly comedy. I ended up really enjoying this film. Its got laughs, love, class, and even a deft touch of sadness.
The film is about a a wealthy 21 year old girl named Emma, who meddles in the lives of those around her. She tries to set her friend up to a man she is not romantically attracted to. As time goes by Emma discovers that trying to fix peoples lives does not always work and then she herself becomes romantically inclined. Along the way Emma realizes how manipulative and haughty she is and the impact that it has on those who are around here. The film also stars Mia Goth, Johnny Flynn, and Bill Nighy.
The attention to detail and the production and costume design are absolutely superb. The film is rich with its intricate detail to period and the nobility involved. The film also possesses vibrant cinematography and camerawork. Its a really nice film to look at in a technical aspect. Anya Taylor-Joy is a talent and she's fantastic in this role. Emma can be despicable at times but there's an allure to her character and you can not help but want to be around her. The performances all around are great. I love seeing Mia Goth getting meaningful work, and I've never seen Bill Nighy have such a keen eye for a chilly draft.
The film just seems more attuned and in sync with Austen's novel than the 1996 version. It embodies a wide range of emotions and can be hilarious with no dialogue at all. The cast have good chemistry and Autumn de Wilde shows a great touch in her impressive directorial debut. I think this film was great fun and is something I want to check out again because I found great (Anya Taylor) joy watching this.
The best part of my night though without a doubt is actually meeting the leading lady on the street after the premiere. She was present for a live Q and A and overall this was quite the experience. I am in heaven!",Emma.

Anyway the movie certainly captured the mood of the book.The movie tells the story of Emma who enjoys sorting out other peoples love life presumably as a distraction from worrying about her own. Anya Taylor-Joy was very good in the lead role and is well supported by Johnny Flynn and Mia Goth as George Knightly and Harriet Smith. I have to confess that I've rather fallen out of love with Bill Nighy though. He seems to play the identical role in every film he features in.If you enjoyed the book then there's a good chance you'll enjoy this movie. If you still enjoy the quirky Bill Nighy role then you'll enjoy it even more.",Emma.
42,bob-the-movie-man,Simply Sublime.,9,21 February 2020,"I loved the look of ""Emma"" from the trailer. And I was not disappointed. It is a simply sublime piece of comic entertainment.Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a rich, privileged 21 year-old looking after her elderly and quirky father (Bill Nighy) in the family stately home. She has never loved, despite the persistent presence of 'family friend' George Knightley (Johnny Flynn), but finds it entertaining to engage in matchmaking, particularly in respect to her somewhat lower class friend Harriet Smith (Mia Goth). Emma has high ambitions for Harriet... ideas significantly above what her social station and looks might suggest.Emma has her sights on a dream.... the mystery man Frank Churchill (Callum Turner), son of wealthy local landowner Mr Weston (Rupert Graves). She has never actually met him, but is obsessed with his myth. #fangirl. As a source of immense annoyance to her, but often a source of valuable information on news of Churchill, is the village 'old maid' Miss Bates (Miranda Hart). ""Such fun""!But Emma's perfect life is about to face sticky times, as her machinations fail to yield the expected results and a stray comment, at a disastrous picnic, threatens to damage both her reputation and her social standing.If you like your movies full of action and suspense, you are digging in the wrong place. ""Emma"" is slow... glacially slow... wallowing in beautiful bucolic scenes (with superb cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt); gorgeous costumes by Alexandra Byrne; and hair styling by Marese Langan.The movie also benefits from a joyfully tight and funny script by debut screenwriter Eleanor Catton (a Man-Booker prize winner). This picks relentlessly at the strata of the class system set up by Jane Austen's novel: ""Every body has their level"" spits spurned suitor Mr Elton (Josh O'Connor).I know Anya Taylor-Joy as the spirited Casey from ""Split"" and ""Glass"": she was impressive in ""Split""; less so for me in the disappointing ""Glass"". But here, I found her UTTERLY mesmerising. She has such striking features - those eyes! - that she fully inhabits the role of the beautiful heiress who haunts multiple men sequentially. I even muttered the word ""Oscar nomination"" at the end of the film: though we are too early in the year to seriously go there.An even bigger surprise was the actor playing George Knightley. Johnny Flynn has been in a number of TV shows I haven't seen, and a few films I haven't seen either (e.g. ""Beast""). But I had the nagging feeling I knew him really well. The illustrious Mrs Movie Man clocked him: he's the Cineworld ""plaid man""! (For those outside the UK or not patrons of Cineworld cinemas, he was the 'star' of a Cineworld advert that played over and Over AND OVER again for months on end before every film I saw. Arrrgggghhhh!).Here, Flynn is excellent as the frustrated and brooding Austen-hunk. He even gets away with an ar*e-shot within a U-certificate!Particularly strong in the supporting cast are Bill Nighy (being delightfully more restrained in his performance); Miranda Hart (being ""Miranda"", but perfectly cast) and Mia Goth (memorable for that eel-bath in ""A Cure for Wellness"").And a big thank-you for a web review in the online Radio Times for naming one of the comical (and bizarrely uncredited) footmen as Angus Imrie - - the truly disturbed stepson of Claire in ""Fleabag"". It was driving me crazy where I knew him from!The one criticism I would have is that I found the (perfectly fine and well-fitting) music, by David Schweitzer and Isobel Waller-Bridge (sister of Phoebe) poorly mixed within the soundtrack. There were times when I found it overly intrusive, suddenly ducking under dialogue and then BLASTING out again. Sometimes music should be at the forefront.... but more often it should be barely perceptible.As you might guess....
...I loved this one. The story is brilliant (obsv!); the film is simply gorgeous to look at; the locations (including the village of Lower Slaughter in the Cotswolds and Wilton House - near me - in Salisbury) are magnificent and a blessing for the English Tourist Board.All the more impressive then that this is the directorial feature of video/short director Autumn de Wilde.This comes with a ""highly recommended"" from both myself and the illustrious Mrs Movie-Man.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook or the web.)",Emma.

44,kjproulx,"Well-Made, Yet Uninteresting",6,24 March 2020,"Films that have an elegant feel and take place hundreds of years in the past usually don't draw me in. For that reason alone, take this review with a grain of salt. Based on the Jane Austin novel of the same name, of which I have never read, I went into this film blindly, as I haven't even seen the previous adaptations either. Although I will be admitting some great things about this film as a whole, I personally found it to be average overall. Here's why you'll probably love this movie if you're into these types of films, but also why it won't win you over if you're not.Emma. follows Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) as she observes the ongoing relationships of her friends and family. Becoming too involved in certain areas, she begins to disrupt those relationships. In particular, she complicates things with her friend Harriet (Mia Goth) when she convinces her to make certain decisions. This made for a slightly frustrating experience for me, as I wasn't too fond of her actions. With that said, Anya Taylor-Joy as the titular character was fantastic, as she always is.Although I haven't seen tons of movies featuring Taylor-Joy in a meaty role like this, I have to admit that her being in a film does pique my interest. Her, along with the supporting cast of this movie, all do a great job in sucking you into this time period. I felt like I was transported back into the 1800s, which is no small feat. Movies like this simply don't work unless the production design is flawless and this film was pretty close to perfect in that regard. Being in the business as a production designer for over 25 years, Kave Quinn did some great work here.This brings me to whether or not you should watch the movie in general. Fans of stories from this time period that are prone to liking movies like this from time to time will probably love this film, because all the elements that these movies usually bore me with are extremely well done, admittedly. There is a flip side to that though. I've never been interested in movies like this unless they broke new ground and made a fresh new spin as The Favourite did in 2018. This movie was very well done though, so I definitely feel a positive grade is warranted.In the end, Emma. may not break any new ground for the genre, but it will more than please those who have been eager to see it. For anyone else, I fear it will either mildly entertain you or leave you bored. The 2-hour run time definitely felt its length for me and I didn't feel that the story went in many interesting directions. I've never exposed myself to this story in the past though, so perhaps this wasn't the best version to start with. Overall, it's a well-made period piece that just didn't interest me all that much.",Emma.
45,Movi3DO,Great Austen's adaptation,8,18 May 2021,"Emma the WingwomanAnother adaptation from Jane Austen's works that was on HBO Max. I didn't read the book, but I found a lot of similarity to Pride and Prejudice, which I have read and watched.The character of Emma was fascinating, and the story was about her maturing and seeing that her actions have consequences. Anya Taylor-Joy again showed herself to be a great actress as she conveyed the care-free and witty young lady that liked to manipulate others.The love polygons here was most entertaining part. Many twists and turns as characters changed and revealed different things.Overall, an entertaining romance and drama filled with social commentary about classes and love. 8/10.",Emma.
46,tm-sheehan,Beautiful Production but Emma's not a woman of substance,7,13 February 2020,"My Review- Emma
My Rating 6.9Before she began the novel,Jane Austen wrote, ""I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.""
Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray plus she is an awful snob.
This was the last of Jane Austen's novels to be published and completed in her lifetime.
Her last novel Persuasion was published posthumously after her death in 1817.This 2020 film version of Emma stars Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma Woodhouse and she is very good as the snobby control freak who is trying to play matchmaker to her friend Harriet Smith also played very well by Mia Goth.
The standout performance for me in this movie is Miranda Hart as Miss Bates as the kind hearted but overbearingly boring twittering Village spinster. Miranda Hart gives the character humour and colour and her performance is worth the price of seeing this good film.
The male characters in this predominantly female dominated story apart from Bill Nighy as the eccentric and delightfully self obsessed humorous father of Emma and Josh O'Connor as Mr Elton The Village Vicar seemed to lightweight to me .
The two romantic leads lacked charm and sex appeal to me Johnny Flynn as George Knightley looked a little scruffy and more suited to the role of Mr Robert Martin the good hearted farmer .Callum Turner also seemed lacking to me in his role as Frank Churchill the charming but deceitful potential suitor of Emma.
Perhaps that was the intention of Autumn de Wilde another impressive female director to avoid well known male stars from stealing the limelight from the
impressive women?
Top 10/10 marks to the Production personnel on this version of Emma it's a joy to watch the Cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt ,Production Designer Kate Quinn, Art Director Alice Sutton, Set Director , Stella Fox (who did ""Judy"" Star Wars Episode V11,) and especially Costume Designer ,Alexandra Byrne ( Phantom of the Opera and Mary Queen of Scots) who should be nominated next year for an Oscar.If you love the World of Jane Austen the frippery and foppery and that long lost past age of strict manners and snobbery of Georgian Society you're sure to love Emma .
I couldn't help comparing Emma to the other recent period film set 60 years ahead in America Greta Gerwig's stunning version of ""Little Women"" with a character Jo March also not looking for marriage but with more a woman of substance than Emma.",Emma.

48,msbreviews,"Anya Taylor-Joy shines, but this new adaptation of Emma. lacks uniqueness.",5,22 March 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Emma. is Autumn de Wilde's feature film directorial debut, as well as Eleanor Catton's screenwriting debut. I never watched any previous adaptations and period movies aren't exactly ""my thing"". This doesn't mean I can't appreciate them! The Favourite and Little Women are the most recent examples of films belonging to said genre that I absolutely love. The main reason why I felt the need to watch this adaptation was Anya Taylor-Joy's first time as the sole protagonist.I genuinely believe she'll become one of the greatest actresses of her generation, along Florence Pugh, Chloë Grace Moretz, Hailee Steinfeld, Kaitlyn Dever, Saoirse Ronan, and a few others. Her performance in this movie is yet another argument to validate my prediction. She's phenomenal as Emma! It took me a while to get used to her voice since she applies a much higher tone than her usual one. Seeing actors doing different accents is pretty common, but changing their voice as Anya does, even if it's a simple modification, it still shows how committed she was to her role.As cliche as it might sound, she carries the whole story on her shoulders. She's the link that connects all storylines and characters. Without her, the film doesn't work, so her display had to be near-perfect. Anya demonstrates her range and emotional ability, as well as a seamless control of the complex and rich script. Most dialogues possess long sentences with sophisticated vocabulary, something only the best actors can deal with effortlessly.Anya shines, but her character does too. Emma's arc is quite interesting. Besides being ""handsome, clever and rich"", she has no respect for the poor, manipulates her friend's romantic decisions, and sometimes acts in a very selfish, arrogant manner. Her transformation into a better person is the most captivating arc of the screenplay, but it also demonstrates my main issue with the movie as a whole. Ten minutes in, and I knew everything that was going to happen.Now, I always try to avoid thinking too much ahead. But when it comes to relationships between characters, it's all so predictable and obvious to me that I can't help but guess the whole story. The same screenplay trick is used throughout to twist certain relationships, becoming repetitive and a bit dull. I never felt truly invested in the film until the one-hour mark. It's mostly well-paced, but when nothing is surprising, innovative, or creative regarding the overall narrative, there's not that much that can keep me captivated.The first act is a tad confusing, with too many characters getting introduced too fast. Honestly, I just discovered while writing this review that a secondary character is supposed to be blood-related to one of the main ones. Story and characters are the two pillars of any movie. I've always written this. If these two don't work, then everything else crumbles. It's far from collapsing, it's actually very well-structured, but it's like these two pillars are just like thousands of others. There's no distinct characteristic that makes these unique.Weirdly enough, I never felt bored. The cast really does a nice job of keeping me entertained by every remarkable performance. Bill Nighy (Mr. Woodhouse) and Miranda Hart (Miss Bates) are quite funny. The costume design is gorgeous besides being extremely important since it actually elevates the story by clearly identifying who's rich and poor. Production and set design are fantastic. Great cinematography (Christopher Blauvelt), and an enjoyable score (Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer). Nevertheless, as outstanding as the technical achievements might be, the film still lacks a unique directing style, which is normal, having in mind it's the director's first feature.All in all, Emma. doesn't reach the latest period movies' level like The Favourite or Little Women, but it's a fine start for debutants director Autumn de Wilde and screenwriter Eleanor Catton. Anya Taylor-Joy delivers an exceptional performance as a very well-written Emma Woodhouse, carrying the film on her shoulders until the very end, cementing her place in Hollywood as one of the greatest actresses of her generation. The rest of the cast is also pretty great. The costume design steals the ""technical show"", but the production level in this movie is impressive. However, the narrative lacks surprising elements, making the existence of this new adaptation a bit questionable. Why make another film if there's nothing unique about it? Predictable from the get-go, confusing first act, and very hard to feel invested before the one-hour mark. If you enjoy period comedy-dramas, I recommend it. Otherwise, the two movies mentioned above are probably a better choice...Rating: C+",Emma.
49,stevelomas-69401,Gentile romantic misdirection from Jane Austen? What a shock.,7,16 February 2020,"Methinks some raunchiness has been added to Emma's tale of romantic misdirection. It's light, it's slight, but mostly faithful gentle entertainment. Effectively an historical feel good film for those with gentile feminine sensibilities.",Emma.

51,garethcrook,No surprises.,6,19 June 2020,"Emma is 21 we're told as this begins, with ""little in her life to vex her"". Lucky Emma I think. Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a posh pain in the arse. It's a comedy, apparently, but I'm left waiting some time before even the slightest of smirks. It looks great though, in the way that most period dramas do. Sweeping vistas with vast country estates, furnished in meticulous grandeur. Thank god for Bill Nighy as Mr Woodhouse, Emma's father, at least he's mildly amusing in his general disinterest of everything. Based on a Jane Austin novel, none of this is a surprise. If you're after something unexpected, look elsewhere. This isn't bad though. Emma's only concern is social standing, meddling and manipulating those around her, like the perpetually unsure Miss Smith (Mia Goth) much to the annoyance of Mr Knightly (Johnny Flynn). It's a large cast, almost unruly and does feel bloated, but at the core, the main characters do work and the casting is pretty fantastic, Miranda Hart particularly is fun as the easily distracted Miss Bates. When I say Emma likes to meddle, that is true. However she meddles with purpose and for all the flowery nature of her world, she's by far the most real being in it. To put it plainly, Emma takes no s**t. Not from the disapproving Mr Knightly or the infatuated Mr Elton. I wouldn't take it from Mr Elton either, he's a bloody idiot. Emma herself doesn't bother with, well with anything. She's happy where she is, for now at least. She harbours a secret desire to be a future Mrs Churchill, to wed the mysterious Frank Churchill, whom we don't meet until the second half of the film. She's got competition though, from Jane Fairfax. Of course this is all misjudged, Emma not being as good a judge a character as she thought. Churchill is meddler himself, or a player, either way he's no good. Arrogant and self centred. It all has an air of silliness. Mr Elton surprises all, by marrying, brilliantly played by Tanya Reynolds from the hysterical TV show 'Sex Education'. Connor Swindells from the same show also features, although both are sadly underused. Confused? I'm sure you're not, but if you are, is just because I'm blurting our a load of character names, really it's all very trivial and predicable. Mr Knightly turning out to be the best catch. Emma turning out to be somewhat naive, Bill Nighy turning out to look exceptional dapper in every scene and capable of portraying his character with the mere lift of an eyebrow. Emma finds herself in unfamiliar circumstances, out of control, without options. The elegant rug pulled from under her. A fine mess she's got herself into. This really isn't my kind of thing, but I enjoyed it all the same. It's pretty forgettable though and I'm sure the book is much much better.",Emma.
52,Azanspy,A beautifully shot romance.,7,24 March 2020,Emma. is watchable just for how well the film is shot. The shots in the film are rich and we can experience that vintage England villages. Anya Taylor has done an incredible job as Emma and we can expect more good roles from her. The movie lags a little bit as the story is told slowly and less humour. But Autumn de Wilde has done a decent job telling this story.,Emma.
53,andrewroy-04316,A competent but overly tidy period adaptation,6,5 January 2021,"I haven't read Emma, so my perspective was fresh coming in, knowing absolutely nothing about the story. The plot felt so trite and obvious that I think I would've liked it more if I had read the book so I could at least appreciate how it works off of the source material. It isn't a bad film - the set design, costumes, and score are all very good, and Anya Taylor-Joy is as solid as you'd expect. Its biggest problem is that even without knowing the book, every character seemed to fit neatly into a precisely drawn character arc, with no surprises or innovations along the way. Emma could be an interesting imperfect protagonist, but everyone simply treats her as though she's perfect and casts no real judgement. Every side character has a clear purpose and doesn't get involved in the story beyond that singular mission. The romance resolution was obvious from literally the first time we meet the pair, and while both performances are good enough to keep it from feeling stale, it still doesn't garner much emotional reaction. By the second half of the film, it was obvious what each character was here to do and where the plot was headed and it simply felt rote. There are some decent ideas here which I'm sure are considered in more depth in the book, particularly Emma's psychology in wanting to be liked and admired by others while not being certain of what she really wanted for herself. It feels like a solid period drama, but if you're looking for a great recent classic adaptation of a period drama, Little Women has a similar feeling but is better in every way. That isn't necessarily a fair bar to hold Emma up to, anyways; this is a fine film, but it's too tidy and uncreative for its own good.",Emma.

55,sweidman-28016,Enjoyable But Probably Forgettable,7,19 March 2020,"Emma. Review:Emma. is based on Jane Austen's beloved comedy about finding your equal and earning your happy ending, is reimagined in this. Handsome, clever, and rich, Emma Woodhouse is a restless queen bee without rivals in her sleepy little town. In this glittering satire of social class and the pain of growing up, Emma must adventure through misguided matches and romantic missteps to find the love that has been there all along. I saw this almost two weeks ago so bear with me on this probably vague and short review. I really like Jane Austen, especially Sense and Sensibility, and the trailer looked like this would be a fun watch. I new nothing about the plot going in which is always a fun experience. I just expected a rom com sort of plot taking place in 19th century. Emma. was an enjoyable movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon. The movie had a fun little tone to it. I don't know how to describe it but it felt like a toned down Wed Anderson type of movie. That goes with some of the acting, set, costumes, and color pallets. I thought the acting was on point. Anya Taylor-Joy never seems to disappoint and played the uptight young lady well. She always gives her everything with her roles and I love it when I don't think much about it being her. I'm coming to see a story about Emma and I want to see Emma, not someone playing Emma. I haven't seen Mia Goth in a role for a while. The last time I believe she had a role was in last years A24 sci-fi drama High Life. I don't have a big issue with Mia Goth, however her voice can get annoying at points because she always seems to talk in the same way. This has been her least type-cast role and she does play a giddy, hopeless romantic girl and I think it's good to see her in another role. My other standout was Miranda Hart as Miss Bates. She always has a fun time with her roles. Hart has a typical type-cast role but I think she has a good time with it and makes it fun for the audience. The set is really beautiful to look at. Emma is obviously a rich woman and the mansion was just extravagant. I'm a sucker when it comes to mansions for sets because there's just so much you can do with them and it's rare to see one look bad. The colors used in the set and costumes were pastels and solid colors that complemented them well. That's what reminded me a lot of Wes Anderson films because the set and costumes always match very well. Also the score, composed by Isabel Waller-Bridge (Fleabag) and David Schweitzer, added you that feel. I like Isabel Waller-Bridge's score to Fleabag and this echoed some of the motifs from it. For example the operatic singing is throughout. It was just an animated score and had its own character that I liked. Mainly my issues reside in the plot. I thought the story was enjoyable, but not always the most interesting. I found myself getting a little bored at points with it getting slower and not caring too much about some characters. The climax, I don't even know if it was supposed to be the climax, didn't feel like a big issue to me. It was a problem that was easily resolved but they tried to make a bigger deal out of it. That's just me though. Emma. is an enjoyable movie, however it's one of those that I'll most likely forget about in the future. I would recommend seeing it though. Universal is releasing it on VOD this Friday along with some other films so if you're interested I would recommend it.My Grade: B",Emma.
56,ethanbresnett,A must for any lovers of period films and gentle comedy,8,21 December 2020,"Emma is a very solid, enjoyable, and charming film, capturing the essence of Austen's characters and humour to perfection.It achieves this primarily through its fabulous cast. Anya Taylor-Joy was an absolute delight as Emma, I couldn't have imagined anybody else playing the part. She brought such a brilliant quirky energy to the role, and her mannerisms were spot on. In truth all of the cast were spot on. They captured the subtleties of the characters perfectly, and this was the highlight of the film for me.I loved the direction and the stylistic choices of the film. They worked so well with the story, giving the film such a joyous and energetic feel. The script was very solid too. Its been a while since I've read the novel so I can't remember too many specifics, but I feel like the essence of Austen was captured perfectly by the screenplay.On top of this, the sets, costume, makeup etc were all fantastic, contributing to the general aura of the film and fully immersing the audience in the period.A great film and a nice easy watch!",Emma.

Its cast, led by the terrific and wonderful Anya Taylor-Joy, are/is utterly splendid. ""Emma's"" script is adapted by novelist Eleanor Catton (The Luminaries) and manages to capture much of Austen's own comedy, translating it elegantly to the screen. The result is a stylish and eminently watchable movie adaptation. In addition to the script, the production values are stellar, while movie is visually stunning and impeccably researched - it really felt like an authentic window into the 1800s. At the end, film - updated in all the right ways - is filled with an abundance of genuine charm. For those who are fans of the period drama this is a must see, while this gentle film, also, deserves to introduce Austen to a whole new generation.Rating: 7+/8-",Emma.

2020
Director: Autumn de wilde
Starring: Anya Taylor Joy, Bill Nighy, Miranda Hart, Tanya Reynolds, Conner Swindell's, Johnny Flynn, Mia Goth, Josh o Connor, Callum Turner etcOverall rating 86/100Emma is based in the 1800's and it follows a very wealthy and stress-free young lady called Emma. Her heart is in the right place but her selfish actions when it comes to finding love for herself and other people have repercussions and she must fight to fix them. Emma was a delightfully charming movie. With excellent performances, humour and very good character development throughout, lets talk about this more in detail.First of all, the film had fantastic cinematography and set pieces, whilst also having a very charming/romantic tone. The films cinematography reminded me a lot of little women's, with its wonderfully natural, simplistic but strikingly beautiful scenery that really was fantastic to look at and get lost in. And the set pieces and costumes were fantastic as well, definitely transporting you to the period of the time, so they did a fantastic job at transporting you to a completely different era in time. The film also had a delightfully charming and romantic tone. The whole film had a warmth to it that never went away throughout. And the film was very romantic which left for many heart-warming moments as you couldn't help but cheer for the characters who all ended up with the right people.Next the film had great themes and messages and was actually fairly funny. The film tackled some big issues still involved within todays society and they were all handled very well. What I got from it was that there is still a social class divide and stereotypes for both that people expect. As well as being careful with not getting to involved with people's personal lives. The film was also fairly funny as well. The film thrived off really awkward situations really well breaking the tension with some very funny one liners and use of props. Key standouts for me were Bill Nighy, Miranda Hart and Tanya Reynolds.However, my only two negatives that bought this film down slightly for me was its occasional slow pacing and its choppy editing. The film was very slow paced and was largely dialogue, which for me wasn't an issue but I can see why it would be a turn off for some other people, but I think Emma knows its target audience. But my biggest issue for me was the choppy editing. The film had really quick cuts, so never really allowed a lot of scenes to resignate with the audience in the first half. This for me was really off putting and made the pacing clunky and made some scenes less impactful.My Next two positives would be the fantastic performance from Anya- Taylor joy and some other key acting standouts. Anya fitted perfectly with the role, she portrayed multiple personalities with her character perfectly, and you always believed that she had good intentions she just was unintentionally selfish. I also thought she had good chemistry with a lot of the other characters within the film as well. The other key standouts for me was Johnny Flynn who portrayed the emotional conflict of his character very well making you understand him and therefore making him likeable to watch. I have previously mentioned key comedic standouts of Bill Nighy, Tanya Reynolds and Miranda Hart who actually surprised me with a couple of more serious scenes as well. But the key standout for me was Mia Goth. She was fantastic here. She had fantastic on screen chemistry with whoever she was with. Her character was extremely likeable and her development throughout of still having Emma to support her but her character slowly learned to make her own decisions and stand on her own two feet and Mia portrayed this character perfectly.My final two positives would be the excellent character development and ending. Wow this film developed its characters excellently. The character of Emma started out as a very up herself and selfish person but with good intentions. And as the film progressed she slowly realised through her actions that she needed to change and this made her character more and more likeable so yes they could of split there time with more of the characters but the development for her character was so good I didn't really care. And finally the ending was incredibly satisfying, they did everything right, Emma apologised to the correct people and everyone ended up with the right people leading to a once again satisfying and heart-warming ending.Overall despite some editing issues which effected the impact of the first half. Emma is a brilliantly acted, charming, well crafted and funny movie that left me feeling satisfied with the end result.",Emma.

64,themadmovieman,"Not a hilarious comedy, but a delightful and gorgeous costume drama",7,16 February 2020,"Moderately succeeding as it tries to find a middleground between modern-day comedy and sumptuous costume drama, Emma is an enjoyable and undeniably pretty watch throughout.It does at times hang heavier on the side of costume drama than witty comedy, and struggles to really engross in its early stages. But, with gorgeous visuals and strong performances, plus a great final act, it proves a thoroughly delightful watch come the finish.Now, I've always been one of those people to shy away a little when it comes to big-screen costume dramas. Too often is it a genre that priorities quaint production over genuinely engaging storytelling, regularly coming off as a little bit like style over substance.Saying that, however, there has been a delightful rebirth in recent years of the costume drama, taking the tropes of classic stories that have been adapted on the big screen a thousand times and injecting a modern, almost anarchic energy into the mix.The best example of that is director Whit Stillman's brilliant Love & Friendship (adapted from Jane Austen's Lady Susan) which, along with gorgeous costumes and production, is an absolute riot throughout.And that's what I felt Emma was missing at times. It's an undeniably beautiful watch, with director Autumn de Wilde's background in photography shining through in the form of beautiful production design, but it's not the non-stop laughterfest that Love And Friendship surprisingly proved.Of course, these are two different stories with differing levels of comedy, but Emma tries to replicate that anarchic approach to Austen on the big screen, and often comes up rather short, never really sparking any big laughs with quick-witted jokes or a sense of gleeful sarcasm.So, as a comedy, Emma isn't a perfect film, but it really comes into its own when it comes to delivering a classic costume drama story. I went into this film hoping for yet another anarchic Austen adaptation, and while the film doesn't quite manage that, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed its faithfulness to the original story.Once again, the lack of comedic zip does mean that the film's themes on high society are less entertaining, but when it comes to romantic intrigue, Emma is a thoroughly enjoyable watch.Particularly in its second half, when we see the meddling Miss Emma Woodhouse meet her match, the film develops a number of pleasantly entertaining romantic storylines that all tie up wonderfully come the finish. It's not a groundbreaking story, but it delivers classic Austen fare in genuinely delightful fashion, without the need for sarcasm in the process.The fun factor of that romantic intrigue is bolstered by a fantastic lead turn from Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays Emma Woodhouse to perfection throughout. With a delightfully ambiguous blend of self-absorbed vanity and still likable characteristics, she's always an interesting watch, and it's a genuine delight to watch her on a rollercoaster of romance throughout.The whole cast is excellent, with memorable supporting performances across the board, but Taylor-Joy is an outstanding lead, bringing the strongest energy and often the closest semblance to a sarcastic, modern approach to Austen in the film as a whole.As a result, there really is a lot to like about Emma. It's far from a perfect film, and lacks comedic energy and ingenuity throughout, also struggling with an often muddled first act.But, once the film gets into its stride, it really impresses with enjoyable and pleasant romantic intrigue, backed up by engaging characters, great performances and utterly gorgeous production and costume design. It doesn't suffer from style over substance as many other costume dramas do, but delivers classic Austen fare in delightful fashion throughout.",Emma.
65,dommercaldi,Looks Great. Fantastic Performances. Romance Underdeveloped,8,28 March 2020,"Pros:
1. The comedy is sharp and witty and produces many wonderful character interactions.
2. Anya Taylor-Joy (Emma Woodhouse), Mia Goth (Harriet Smith), Josh O'Connor (Mr. Elton), and Johnny Flynn (Mr. Knightley) give brilliant performances.
3. The set and costume design are utterly mesmerising. The costume design, in particular, is exceedingly colourful to cement the bright and light-hearted tone.
4. The score and soundtrack does an amazing job at adding bounce and energy to the film. The last song, 'Queen Bee' by Johnny Flynn, beautifully rounds off the movie as well.
5. The cinematography is gorgeous. It's well-shot and visually stunning.
6. There is fantastic chemistry between Anya Taylor-Joy and Mia Goth, as well as between Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn.
7. The ending is suitably heartwarming and satisfying. It ties up the plot and sub-plots nicely.Cons:

2. Most of the love triangles, for the most part, are poorly developed and don't feel genuine at all.",Emma.
66,coombsstephen,One for the purists,4,21 February 2020,"I am not a massive fan of period dramas but I will give any film a try and write often like them, however I just found this film as dull as dishwater.To be honest the story proves that not everything great writers write is great. It's a pretty obvious film with not a great plot and very little drama.The acting and the scenery are ok but the pace is painfully slow.",Emma.
67,Darkjak007,My Queen bee,7,16 March 2021,"Based off of the Jane Austen novel. Emma tell us a story about a woman who spends her time meddling to set up people in relationships but eventually meddling backfires. Anna Taylor joy gives a lovely performance as Emma. She comes off in the typical fashion of how you would suspect from this kind of story. She's strong-willed independent , speaks her mind, she thinks she's doing good even though they come out being rather selfish. When she can't even feel the need to commit to someone herself but yet feels the urge to judge others. Johnny Flynn as Mr. Knightley right off the back you can tell that both him and Emma really connect they both have a childish fun persona to each other and not and he's not really much of a stick of mud and he's willing to except our for her ""Flaws"" Callum Turner as Frank Churchill you hear about this guy throughout the whole first half of the movie everyone talks about him when you see him you don't necessarily see anything that special about he apart from his being charming he comes off rather full of himself. He doesn't even really care for the town. The movie's worst parts are during the first hour while it's nicely shot this whole movie from start to beginning the first hour it just moves out or rather snail pace and focus on Emma's friendship with Harriet and how it develops and Emma trying to help with Harriet's relationship but he just moves too slow. While the second part of the film is where the movie picks up as a focus more on Emma still trying to help her but at the same time being to question her own feelings and stuck between a turmoil on what to do. Right about at the ball scene is where everything starts to happen the most. Music overall is really good peaceful it's energetic , it comes off as comedic in some parts every time you hear flutes playing in the background and how the characters move you almost expect the actors to break out into a song. The locations are bright and colorful and shot very well the costume designs are appropriate for the time. Inside of the homes are well decorated same with the haberdasher shop very colorful clothing and paintings on the walls. There's some funny moments in the movies once in particular when Emma sits down and has tea with someone you just feel the awkwardness. Emma overall Is a beautiful production piece there are some parts where it lags it makes up for it with its characters, tone and production.",Emma.

Firstly, the plot is interesting, it shows lifes of young men and women, their emotions and inner experience, it happens in the middle of 19th century in England. Characters are wonderful, I really like Emma and her friends. Secondly, the cast is great, Anya Taylor-Joy is a brilliant of film.
So, it's funny romance film.",Emma.
70,Dunham16,a much disliked protagonist who repents at the end,8,21 March 2020,"EMMA is an early nineteenth century Jane Austen novel abouit a twenty one year old meddling busybody incorrectly assuming she understands and assists her neighbors. The plot is the reverse of most Austen plots centered pm a charming worthy if not noticed heroine finds general commuity acceptance at the end . Her EMMA plot has the heroine called to task near the end to finally repent and in doing so find community respect and happiness. Most two hour screenings of Austen plots have some better features and others not as good as the lot . I thinkk the characters not well portrayed in this version ad Knightly, John, and Isabella. Mrs. Bates. Mr. Elton, Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. and Mrs .Cole Harriet,. Mr. Martin and Jane Farfax seem the closest to Austen's intentions.",Emma.
71,Hallelujah289,Colorful and lighthearted with enough chemistry,8,5 November 2020,"I've watched a few adaptations of Jane Austen's ""Emma."" This is a very good addition with its confectionary color scheme, and many kinds of lighthearted deliveries to match. Even the famous love confession was a bit lighthearted.I liked this adaptation. Austen's earnest male onlooker characters (like Mr. Knightley) are always breathless to watch. Emma here is well chosen, with her pristine look and graceful manners. Emma in the book is quite young and perhaps for the first time the actress quite looks it (I do not know her age).A good cast, with some oddities. Miranda Hart as Miss Bates was perfectly awkward and lovable. Mia Goth made a fine Harriet Smith. Emma's silly, hypochondriac father was played by the rather too healthy, poised and austere Bill Nighy.I agree Mr. Knightley looked a bit young, and for some reason this film played up his athleticism with an early nude scene for him. I don't know why they made a point of it, and it was odd to sexualize him. I am actually not sure that any nudity has been seen before in a Jane Austen adaptation (even Emma shows her posterior briefly for some reason). Mr. Knightley is a romantic interest, but also someone who always has Emma think of what is proper, so it is just a bit out of type.Anyway, this adaptation takes other liberties, like more intimacy and kissing than probably was actually acceptable for the time. But I enjoyed it anyway, and the film fulfills other fantasies like a wedding scene and etc. I'd watch again.",Emma.
72,tfminfl,Single Lady Helps Others...,7,13 March 2020,"409. Emma. My favorite characters from this one were these two servants that each scene they were in, the look of utter disdain towards the family members was priceless. I was kind of hoping there would've been a rebellion at some point and ends in a bloodbath, it's not that movie. This is a movie about a girl who can't mind her own damn business. Does she have good intentions? Maybe. So Emma is a matchmaker, and she's terrible at it. However everyone listens to her advice, with disastrous results, probably cause she's cute and rich, not that, that ever influences people's decisions. They certainly don't listen based on Emma's own track record, single since like...forever. Decent period piece, Anna Taylor-Joy looked exactly like you'd think Emma would look like, did a pretty good British accent. Funny and worth checking out. Filmbufftim on FB.",Emma.
73,LukeCustomer2,A mixed bag.,5,25 April 2021,"I had heard this was the best Emma but for my money that remains the 1996 version. We all know the story but this tries to take things to the ""next level"" in more blunt ways. Unfortunately that just comes off as a bit crass. For instance there seems to be an extended sequence where Knightly, completely aroused by dancing with Emma, runs to her house after the ball. I just can't see that as something that would be done. Frank Churchill remains imho too obviously a scoundrel even when he is playing all goodness and I get no real interest on Emma's part. I also feel Anna Taylor Joy is just wrong for the part as she is too focused and intense. The declaration is imho ruined by an odd choice they make that seems to come out of a horror movie. There were good aspects. Emma is more snobby at first and earns her comeuppance. Some of the dialog was improved. Emma also seems to know on some level she is very interested in Mr. Knightly's good opinion of her, running to pay the piano when she sees him walking toward her home. Other versions have her almost indifferent to him at first. I thought Johnny Flynn did a good job with almost every line delivery.",Emma.
74,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"A nice and sweet movie, but the comedy didnt always land.",7,3 March 2020,"I felt like the film struggled to find its footing for the first 10-15 minutes. But it does pick up. I dont know if I can explain it well but it felt like the film was trying to hard to appeal to a modern audience. Not with costumes or dialogue...but the kind of way the comedy was presented. Like, I just dont think we really needed a scene where Emma lifts up her skirt to warm her bare bum by the fire. But as I said, I thought the film picked up early into the film and I was able to get into it without much issue. I very much enjoyed the scene where Knightley and Emma do realize their feelings for one another and he runs back to her house. Although the actual proposal scene...again had a unnecessary element (in my opinion) where she has a nosebleed. Again, felt like a random throw in for a laugh. I also didnt like the actor playing Elton. I don't know if it was his choice or a director's choice but he just came off very weird. I know his character is supposed to be kind of like that, but his acting seemed to be comprised of weirdly smiling at the camera. I dont know it was very off-putting. I thought everyone else was very good though. Anya-Taylor Joy is very good as the title character Emma, but I overall liked Mia Goth's Harriet more. I think there was a tad more of a ""natural"" presence to her. I thought Johnny Flynn was good as Knightley although a tad distracting how short he was in comparison to other male leads.Overall, I did really like the film. I thought it was very cute, charming and funny. And the costumes are stunning. Well in particular what Emma gets to wear. And the production design is very nice as well. I love how bright and cheery everything looks.",Emma.

Really ?? If churches had soft pastels as interiors perhaps more people would go to church these days.Then there was Mr Knightly who needed a good comb through his hair. Sorry but he didn't cut the mustard as Jane Austin's dashing chap, and only Jeremy Northam's Mr Knightly will forever be the best. Then there was Harriet - oh dear, the actress was really over acting and painful to watch. Bill Nighy played himself to perfection.In all, I lasted about an hour, then fast forward to the end.

Regardless, I did enjoy this movie quite a bit. It was sweet and very Austen-esque and I believe other Jane Austen fans would enjoy it, as well! So overall, while I prefer the 2009 mini-series, I still liked and would recommend it highly.",Emma.
80,gcsman,"Fine production, if not the best ""Emma"" out there",7,19 July 2020,"This was the last movie my wife and I saw in the actual theater-- back in March 2020 -- just days before covid-19 lockdown began. As of July we're wondering when we'll ever get to see another. In the meantime we've acquired a big UHD TV and subscriptions to a bunch of streaming services. But there's still nothing to match watching on a big screen with a packed audience of engaged viewers.Anyway: long before there was ""Mean Girls"" and ""Clueless"", there was Jane Austen's novel about a good-hearted but manipulative, un-self-aware young woman who has a great deal of learning to do about real people. This most recent version of ""Emma"" is very nice and certainly worth seeing in whatever format. I think it's neither better nor worse than the good 1996 version (the one with Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role) -- they both have fine production values and fine casts, just different emphases, shadings of the various characters, and the choices for cuts made to the story to make it fit into a normal 2-hour run time. Anya Taylor-Joy is not only a good, distinctively featured young actress but she also *looks* as young as Jane Austen's heroine is intended to be, about age 20. She has the (often baseless) self-confidence arising from a privileged, untroubled upbringing, but a journey of self-discovery awaits her, and that's what makes the story.Other standout characters include Mia Goth, who plays friend/protegee Harriet Smith as even more of a hapless stooge than usual; and the incomparable Bill Nighy as Emma's father Mr. Woodhouse. Is he really just a hypochondriac always fussing over cold drafts and fireplaces? It becomes clear that he knows and sees a good deal more than his loving but blithely unobservant daughter gives him credit for. And Nighy can steal scenes without saying a word, just by body posture and a raised eyebrow. He's a cinematic treasure. Johnny Flynn as Mr. Knightley is fine but a bit forgettable in the end.And the scenery. It's so lush and green and bright that you have to consciously shake yourself to realize that no, the English countryside is really NOT always warm and sunlit as it is here. But this is fiction, and it just helps us settle in and enjoy the comfortable ride through this classic tale. For the best screen version of Emma out there, though, I happily recommend the 2009 TV miniseries starring Romola Garai. She's perfect for the part, and its 4-hour length lets the full story expand and breathe the way it should.",Emma.

The 1996 version stretches out the romantic agony a bit better but this is more humorous. Bill Nighy's subtle comic relief is great. Anya Taylor-Joy does really well as Emma and beautifully portrays her inner conflict as she realises her social shortcomings.

Such is the source material which has its own unique charm and wit. And as such, this adaptation of Emma is a pretty enjoyable watch.It took me a while to get used to the setting, as the camera work at first, felt more like for TV than a feature (mainly due to the vibrant color pallet), but as it went on, that particular vibrancy felt justified.I think the actors were splendidly cast, and performed well... each offering their own unique personality to occupy this universe.

92,jmvscotland,Beautiful to look at but not much of a story,7,11 November 2020,"Before I get to my perception of the merits of this movie, please just let me make one observation.If life for the well born in early 19th Century Britain really was as portrayed here, I just have to say what a vapid and pointless life it would appear to have been.Was daily life for such people really all about marital matches between one chinless wonder and another chinless wonder or was there something else to their existence. Life for the poor, starving and covered with cankers was probably pretty awful but their daily struggle might also have been a bit more interesting than life for the rich, as shown here in this movie.Now, back to the movie. I hadn't seen Anya Taylor-Joy until just recently when I watched ""The Queen's Gambit"" on Netflix. She was just wonderful as the character Beth Harmon in that one and also very good here, playing the part of Emma Woodhouse.This movie is stunningly beautiful to look at. Every shot was carefully framed and beautifully lit, the costumes were gorgeous and the script well adapted from the novel. The result is a movie that's very pleasing to the eye but not quite so easy on the mind. At a little over two hours, I found it frankly a bit boring and I struggled a bit towards the end of the two hours.Emma was entertaining enough for most of its length but I shalln't be hanging out to watch it again any time soon. By all means watch it. It's nice but in my view not terribly interesting as cinema.JMV",Emma.

The real problem with Emma is that the plot doesn't necessarily have any strong characters except for the central one. The movie teases multiple conflicts between the characters and fails to focus seriously on a single one.Most of the plot points are so forgettable and in the middle of the film you would be wondering what's the point of this movie. Anya Taylor Joy shines as Emma Woodhouse and Mia Goth is neat. Bill Nighy appears on the screen every now and then but his character is completely wasted.Watch it if you are a huge aficionado of Jane Austen if not skip it.",Emma.
94,madanmarwah,Disappointing adaptation,5,13 July 2021,"Can a movie manage to keep audience attention solely through its visuals, glorious costumes and splendid cinematography ? The answer is obviously no. The movie needs an engrossing narrative, interesting dialogue, realistic acting among other things which captivates the average audience. Sadly this film adaptation of a classic tale leaves much to be desired. You will be better off seeing the 1996 film with Gwynneth Paltrow which was far more absorbing. Or you can settle down with Greta Gerwig's "" Little women"" which you will definitely enjoy more.This movie strikes one as totally artificial and has very average acting by all. The wooden stuck up attitude of the characters doesn't look natural. The story telling is mixed up and dreary. The narration drags on and on without creating interest. The comedy is hardly amusing. The film is disappointing on the whole.The good part is that the outdoor scenes are very beautiful and exquisitely photographed, but as I said earlier these scenes can't keep you engaged in the absence of good acting and dialogue. I am giving it 5 stars for the costumes, make up and cinematography.",Emma.
95,Pat100,Made a Mess Of the Story,5,18 April 2021,"You can probably sum up most books in a few sentences. I felt that was done in this adaptation then some stuff was added to flesh it out.

97,debdshaw60,Deeply disappointing,2,12 March 2020,"Emma is one of my favorite Jane Austin novels. This production is a travesty overall. The costumes and hair and locations are sumptuous and beautiful but do little to cover the fact that the director and perhaps lead actress did not understand the book at all.Emma is meant to be charming and sweet if wrong headed and a bit spoiled. Her heart is good and she's usually incredibly kind except when under the influence of Frank Churchill and she immediately regrets her actions.In this version, Emma is rendered to be a superscillious brat with no real thought for anyone but herself. Bill Nighy is seriously underused and is one of the bright spots in the film. Miranda Hart is the only other bright spot. I'm not sure what on earth they were thinking. 2 hours of film went by without hitting in any part of the story that would lead to coherence. There was zero chemistry between any of the characters. They took a story that's light and charming and made it heavy and distasteful.I'd definitely not recommend this to either readers of the book or anyone else because they definitely will not have even a fraction of an understanding of the tone of the book and wonder why on earth anyone could care about this story at all.How very sad that they could have done a modern remake like this and just completely miss the mark.",Emma.
98,helenbassett,"Emma. Film Review - Autumn de Wilde Directs Anya Taylor-Joy, Bill Nighy & Miranda Hart In A Manners & Matchmaking Romp",10,6 March 2020,"Jane Austen's well loved heroines including Elizabeth Bennett, Fanny Price and Ann Elliot are mainly gentlewomen, without large dowries, and therefore in need of a good marriage. Anya Taylor-Joy relishes the period role of the tightly curled Emma Woodhouse, being neither in need of a dowry nor a husband, preferring instead to matchmake her friends. But unhappily happy with her success as she watches her own governess Miss Taylor marry Mr Weston, a nearby wealthy widower. With Rupert Graves and Gemma Whelan the happy couple.Autumn de Wilde directs Emma. with Bill Nighy as her father, hilariously suffering from chills, and keeping his men busy around the house moving screens to continuously keep them from him. They were an unscripted hoot, and the film highlighted the idleness of the wealthy of the time.In dire need of a project Emma embarks upon finding her giddy new friend a suitable husband. Mia Goth is terrific as the red cloaked naive schoolgirl Harriet Smith. And Emma sees local vicar Mr Elton as the perfect candidate. With toady Josh O'Connor, Jane Austen definitely had a thing against vicars, writing such odious characters, but sadly in 1815 they were considered a catch.Emma's neighbour and conscience Mr Knightly is the lovely Johnny Flynn, although sadly a little lacking in height when lined up to dance. But he's rich and single. And having known Emma since childhood is not afraid to tell her off when she needs it. I enjoyed seeing more of Mr Knightley's home life rather than him just arriving and leaving. And loved how Autumn de Wilde updated her Emma to include Christmas visitors Mr Knightley's brother and Emma's sister as a married couple struggling as new parents. We haven't seen such domestic strops before. I have to say I think Oliver Chris's John was getting the rougher end of his marriage to Chloe Pirrie's Isabella. Mr Knightley has been warned.A subsequent Christmas dinner at the Weston's home was a real farce, being rudely interrupted by the threat of snow and a comedic dash to the carriages by hypochondriac Mr Woodhouse and Isabella. Leaving the Westons spinning in their empty dining room and Emma facing a carriage ride home with the oily Mr Elton. It does not end well for Harriet!But this is Emma's story and Mr Knightley watches all her movements from the side lines. He has the measure of their friends and acquaintances even if Emma herself cannot see them. Chief amongst them is Frank Churchill. Callum Turner plays the scandalous cad who intrigues and catches Emma's eye. And while Knightley tries to dissuade her from falling for him, after all he didn't even have the courtesy to come to his father's marriage to Miss Taylor, Knightly implores, but Emma will take no notice. And Mr Elton, who Knightley knows will never marry Harriet with no fortune or name, but his tenant farmer Connor Swindells's Mr Martin would make an admirable husband. And they do seem to love each other, even if Harriet spurns him, when Emma turns her snobby nose up at the decent farmer. Obnoxious Mr Elton does of course end up with the perfectly awful and rich wife he deserves, played by the game Tanya Reynolds.The score by Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer was witty, with almost Gilbert & Sullivan like comedic tunes with the genteel Regency dancing mixes. I love the Regency period so Kate Quinn's production design was divine with sumptuous Georgian Palladian mansions and the local haberdashery store, a purveyor of fancy goods, a veritable Aladdin's cave. And the colourful sugar iced Regency costumes by talented Alexandra Byrne were beautiful.Into this gorgeous comedy of manners drops Jane Fairfax to set the cat amongst the pigeons. Emma has already had quite enough of her with Miss Bates excited descriptions of her niece. Miranda Hart added the comedy to the genteel unmarried Miss Bates fallen on hard times with her deaf mother. But Jane is her source of satisfaction and comfort. And would Miss Woodhouse like to hear what is happening in Jane's most recent letter?Well Jane is here now and Miss Bates is eager for them to meet, and maybe be great friends. Jane is poor, pretty and accomplished, whereas Emma is rich and pretty so has no need to be truly accomplished. But she is jealous. Especially when Mr Knightley pays attention to Jane, duets with her, and lends her his carriage afterwards. To be honest I thought Amber Anderson's Jane was an insipid character, Polly Walker played her with more spark, but she may have been scripted that way by Eleanor Catton. The script overall was sparkling with zingers and Frank Churchill adding catty comments for Emma's amusement. All coming to a head at a picnic where everyone is having a good time, until Emma insults Miss Bates, to everyone's discomfort. Gwyneth Paltrow did it way better. There was so much cruelty in her dripping words, Anya was far too sweet. But Mr Knightley is quick to chastise her.And realising her callousness Emma does try to grow, eating humble pie and making amends with those she has wronged. And even accepting that Mr Knightley may love someone. Who isn't her. Just as she realises that all their sweet nothings were actually something after all.Well done to Autumn de Wilde for her first directing gig and a very entertaining cast and crew.",Emma.

100,Opinate,Kill your darlings.,5,21 March 2020,"Every filmmaker/artist/musician of any worth knows that sometimes you get a brilliant idea and it fits and its great, sometimes you get a crazy idea and it distracts from the main thing you are trying to get across. The trick is to know which it is. The bloody nose Emma has in the pivotal scene when Knightly is (?) declaring his love (?) is such a thing. It should have been killed before it got on screen, since it steals the focus from that one scene, that the entire movie has been working up to. I am still wondering why would anyone in their right mind want to distract from that moment? What possible purpose did an outpouring of blood from Emma's nose have? I thought she was having a brain hemorrhage and needed to go to hospital.I was suddenly in a modern era wanting to dial 911. The rest of the scene just faded away and all I could see was her bloody nose.
That is one example of the many times this film left the excellent qualities Jane Austen is revered for - brilliant banter, sparkling dialogue, wonderful character, and in Emma, a great comedy of errors - to shine a light on extraneous nonsense that really did not matter. The result is a confusion of ideas, weak characters and a less than riveting movie. The music is another such abstraction. When you have something as good as Jane Austen's Emma, just stick to the script.
Update: Apparently the director put the bloody nose in to show that Emma and Knightly are just 'hot messes' and because she gets nose bleeds all the time. That tells me she didn't trust Jane Austen's carefully laid out characterizations of the two main characters to show us who they are, and she didn't trust her audience enough to understand the characters without a show of blood. Emma is intelligent and witty, but she is young and impetuous (perhaps like the director) and Knightly is older and the voice of reason. It is because he is older that he restrains himself. Much as I liked the actor who played Knightly, I think the casting was off and they did a disservice to the original material by not contrasting the ages of the two main characters. The director also says Knightly is a man-splainer. Not true. He is older and wiser. His sex is irrelevant since a female character could have easily reacted in the same way to Emma's outlandish behavior and given the same advice. Knightly is one of the few voices of reason in the novel, and the only one with the station to make Emma listen to reason. Her father is woefully inept at teaching her anything.
I feel as if the director took a quick glance at the material and said 'roll em' without ever understanding the elegant balance of contrasting personalities and mistaken ideas in this great work.
The scenery and costumes are pure eye candy, it's worth watching it just for those, and the acting is very good, exceptional mostly.",Emma.
101,verna-a,Can't get the basics right,4,20 March 2020,"Some fatal attraction means I must watch new Jane Austen screen adaptations although I find them invariably less than satisfying. This version of Emma is no exception as its faults are egregious. I could tell almost straight away it was going to be gimmicky in the way that filmmakers of dubious merit think they can add bits of business to wonderful classics, or distort things completely, as an ""improvement"". I fantasize that, in a better world, there might be some court to hear applications to make screen adaptations, to determine whether the filmmaker actually understands what it is about the story and the characters that give these works of literature their timeless appeal. So often they don't, as they change and destroy what is so fundamental to the success of the original. Somebody give them a ""Cliff's Notes"" to read, at the very least!
Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of ""Emma"" is a likeable, open-natured young woman, who has faults but learns to become a better person. That's in the novel, anyway. The Emma depicted in this film wears alternately an arrogant or sulky expression, seems to have selfish and nasty motives and thoroughly deserves to be taken down a peg, which more or less happens. Newsflash to the filmmaker - she is such an unpleasant person that I don't care. Mr Knightley is a calm, confident sophisticated man of the world, someone of deep and genuine feelings - and dead sexy with it. Johnny Flynn's version is a nice young man but something of a klutz. How does he even like this hardfaced Emma? - again you've lost me. I have to contrast the failure of the lead characters to pull their weight in delivering the story, with the Romola Garai/Jonny Lee Miller version where they got it so right.
To carry on with the catalogue of ""wrongness"" in this version, Frank Churchill, an important and attractive character in the story, is presented by an actor lacking in looks and charm, a complete nonentity. To mention some minor characters, I fully expected Bill Nighy to ham it up with the Mr Woodhouse character, and he does. But why oh why do they have to make Emma's sister Isabella and brother-in-law John Knightley unpleasant and unhappy people - it's so wrong! While not a major theme, their domestic happiness is a beacon to Emma and Mr Knightley to follow their example, and recognize their destiny. I could go on - Harriet Smith isn't pretty, Miss Bates isn't talkative enough, and Mr Elton is a grinning gargoyle. If I pull myself up with an effort to acknowledge the positives of the film, there are beautiful landscapes and house interiors, and great costumes and hairstyles, real eye candy. The dialogue is reasonably respectful of the original. But I wasn't happy for a minute watching the film. I am entitled to have high expectations of a Jane Austen adaptation, and was majorly disappointed, so only a 4/10.",Emma.
102,sherilcarey,Weirdly bad for a movie with a few great hits,4,17 September 2021,"Other reviewers have covered a lot of positives about the sets and the costume, some of which I totally agree with. But to have a movie with such high points in those areas as this had end up so...just not good was a bizarre experience. It seemed to have a good many issues mixing together and I'm sure I lost track of a few things and shouldn't write a long review trying to cover everything. But I will say there were some pacing issues, and lots of small things that seem to be from the movie makers personalities pasted over the story including but far from limited to the skin show shots. They really do distract from any attempt to make out the Austen characters or convey the anything else at all honest about the original work this is based on or I guess just steals from without honestly trying to convey anything from that work. Can't help but suspect this is one of those times that someone who doesn't even like (or even hates) the original material made the show.",Emma.

De Wilde approaches the film with a light touch and the actors are allowed to carry the film. Bill Nighy is especially great, which is amazing because he was not given much to work with. Taylor-Joy is the glue that keeps this whole production together. She is likable, charming, spoiled, and human, relatable even to the modern audiences.",Emma.
110,thomasmitilis1995,"EMMA YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE MATCHES OR FORETELL THINGS. WHATEVER YOU SAY, ALWAYS COMES TO PASS!!!",6,13 May 2020,"PROS:
~Anya Taylor-Joy nails the role of the titular character and portrays a woman with a more dynamic style than the usual considering the specific period of time. She succeeds in being annnoying and charming at the same time and proves once again that she is one of the best actresses of her generation. Emma is an independent woman who considers every decision she takes is the right one. However, she soon realizes that her actions have a negative effect on the others. For instance, she manipulates Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) about her future and her beliefs and she offends Miss Bates with her comments (Miranda Hart).
~Mia Goth is excellent as Harriet Smith and you root for her character all the way through. Harriet is a woman who seeks hapinness in her life but depends too much on the beliefs of Emma until she finally realizes what's the best for her.
~The misinterpretations of the characters is one of the most strong aspects of the film especially the ones by Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton.
~The depiction of the high society is impressive. Examples of this are the way the servants behave towards Emma, the manners that rich people should demonstrate each other (with one comment they can easily be offended like Miss Bates) and the way they usually celebrate (the dance and the piano segments are fantastic). The dialogue of the film is witty and helps you understand the subtlety and the finesse these people should display. In addition, the film indicates that even between rich people there is a different valuation.
~Bill Nighy as the father of Emma is amusing and steals the show every time he appears on screen.
~From a technical point, the movie is impeccable. The production design is top-noch, the cinematography is beautiful and the costumes are excellent.
~The music score and the bright colors enhance perfectly the atmosphere of that era.CONS:
~The pacing of the movie is uneven at some points because some subplots aren't interesting enough. For example, the segment until the arrival of Mia Goth is a little boring.
~Josh O'Connor portrayal as Mr. Elton is cartoonish and doesn't fit in the tone of the film. Furthermore, the scenes with his wife are repetitive and the humor doesn't always land for that reason.
~The storyline about Frank Churchhill (Callum Turner) is underdeveloped. You never feel an erotic tension between him and Emma so the reveal about his secret marriage isn't something intriguing. Moreover, it would be better if the movie focuses more on the antagonism between Emma and Jane (Amber Anderson).
~The ending is predictable despite the chemistry between Emma and Mr. Kneightly (Johnny Flynn).",Emma.

You have no idea how huge it is that I gave it a 4-star rating out of 10. Normally, I give 8's-10's. This is how much I detested the movie.

114,fandomfatale,Great new version,10,28 February 2020,"I'm a HUGE fan of Emma so I went and saw this the first chance I had (after what felt like an agonizingly long wait). I was not in any way disappointed.Like all of the other adaptions, De Wilde's version has its own unique charms. I don't need a 'definitive' version; as far as I'm concerned, the more of them the better as long as they each have something to offer - I'll watch them all, again and again. This was one offers quite a lot. I can think of a number of scenes that I can't wait to see again - scenes that are faithful to the story we already know and love but are not like what we have seen onscreen already.I have a few small nitpicks - several lines that were rushed/not given their full emotional weight; Mr. Woodhouse's bouncy energy; Mr. Knightley's a little too young (but the performance was fantastic); Emma being perhaps a little too cold; the pivotal romantic scene near the end was just not quite right, not quite strong enough - but nothing that would prevent me from giving it a 10/10.It's a funnier movie than the trailer suggests. I thought a lot of the jokes in the trailer fell a little flat but they fit much better into the movie itself and there were some other quite funny new moments.I don't think any fans of Emma should have any reservations about seeing this one.",Emma.

The culmination of this lack of communication is when Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) and George Knightley (Johnny Flynn) are under a tree, having extreme difficulty telling each other how they feel about each other.The innuendos, the backhanded slights, and the occasional direct put-downs throughout this story were, on occasion, amusing. Still, mostly they struck me as arrogant attacks on people who had less social standing than others.Emma is a rich girl in her early twenties, living in a large house on an estate in England. She lives there with her father, Mr. Woodhouse (Bill Nighy). It is near a small town, and because of her wealth, she's looked up to by everyone in the village. When Emma walks into a store, everyone bows or curtsies. She hires friendships and people to spend time with her; Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) is one such person.We watch Emma try to influence and control who gets engaged to whom, including Harriet. Emma is devoted to her father and has no intention of ever marrying. Emma is also forever being prodded and challenged by Knightly, her neighbor.Knightley lives in a vast empty estate by himself. Interior shots of the house show most of the furniture covered up.Although I didn't like the character, Taylor-Joy was good as the arrogant Emma. Nighy was appropriately clueless as Emma's father. Flynn did a terrific job of being the rich neighbor who suddenly harbored deeper feelings for Emma. Goth was sublime. She portrayed innocence and faith that Emma was looking out for her in a beautiful way. Eleanor Catton wrote this screenplay, that to me, was way to elongated. Autumn de Wilde directed this movie. It was at least 40 minutes too long and uninspired.Overall: Despite the brief moments of hilarity, it was painfully long and contrived.",Emma.

117,mickman91-1,Pretty but feels a bit soulless,6,12 November 2021,"I saw this before seeing the Queen's Gambit, so I wasn't yet won over to the brilliance of anya taylor joy. This film did not win me over at the time. I thought she came across as overly haughty and disconnected. You may say that Emma is meant to be an un-likeable character, and that may be true, but I think a truer version of Emma would be of a young woman whom we know has lost her way and who is treating people less than honourably, but who is doing so because of her own fears and insecurities and who journeys through the course of the story to understand this more and to endeavour to be better in the future. There should be an empathetic and redemptive aspect to her despite her meanness. This was wholly lacking in this. And I now think it is far more about the production than taylor joy's portrayal. The film was overly focussed on looking good and missed connecting the characters with the audience. It reminds me of Bridgerton in that all the time and effort was spent on making things look great but the characters are pretty lifeless. Johnny Flynn was the best I thought he got the personality of Mr Knightley really well, but again the production didn't allow this to come through as well as it might. I really respect the attempt to bring Austen to modern audiences, I am not a purist, however this just regretfully isn't a great adaptation of the story nor a great movie.

119,nooshie-33142,Charming update - Austen with a rom com edge!,8,22 March 2020,"I love Jane Austen adaptations and have seen all of them over the years. This is a very charming and witty take on Austen's most well loved, meddling heiress, Emma Woodhouse. Anya Taylor-Joy radiates poise, puzzlement and sparkle and is a relatable 21st century heroine without losing the19th century character. Her huge brown eyes are truly ""windows to her soul"" and I found her quite mesmerizing. I loved Johnny Flynn as one of the sexiest Mr Knightley's yet and had no idea he was an actor, only knowing him as a folk singer. He is a perfect foil for quicksilver Emma and has no problem putting her firmly in her place. Mia Goth is a wonderful Harriet Smith, loveable, gullible and sweet. Most of the supporting players were excellent with special praise to Miranda Hart for her poignant portrayal of poor Miss Bates - cruelly and thoughtlessly hurt by Emma. The costumes were stunning, the settings sublime, the music interesting (old English folk tunes in the main) and the script crackled things along well. There is a lot of walking about in beautiful stately homes or bucolic country lanes, but that is an Austen trope that seems to be compulsory now. One small gripe was the ""mystery of the pianoforte"", which is usually a big part of any retelling of Emma, was hardly touched upon and Frank Churchill seemed miscast to me. Neither good looking enough, nor charmingly raffish enough to be really interesting as a character. I thought the portrayal of this key character by Callum Turner was a bit flat. Another small minus was although the costuming was sumptuous and on point, Mr Woodhouse, played very charmingly by Bill Nighy, looked more Edwardian than Regency. His trousers were just not right! Overall, the best adaptation of Emma for a long time. Good performances, great locations and costumes and at the centre if it, Anya Taylor Joy's charismatic Emma.",Emma.

Bill Nighy, whom I was really looking forward to, was too hearty and Sprightly to be Mr Woodhouse. Emma was too cold, and lacked the liveliness of Emma's character. It wasn't the actors who disappointed me really- I think the story was cut so much- it felt like being told a quick summary of the book. It felt as if the heart of the story wasn't there. Perhaps this is why I preferred the mini series. This film was too short to do the story justice. It covered the salient points of the narrative- but had no Austen atmosphere. Not for me.

AtonementEmma is a 2020 film based on the Jane Austen novel that has been adapted to the screen for the sixth time now; starring the rising Hollywood star Anya Taylor-Joy. It's about a young lady, Emma, who think the world of herself and her matchmaking skills, trying to give advice and set other people's lives in order, while she herself doesn't really have a clue where her own life is headed. It's about youthful hubris and romantic misunderstanding.The film is very atmospheric, you instantly get emerged into the early 19th century England, with amazing decorations and colorful costumes; getting a court-like feel that the rich families of that time were going for. The dialogues are intelligent, well-crafted and pleasant to listen to (that's more of an acclaim of Austen's writing skills that the films feature, but anyway); and the film is very well-made in general. However, for the sake of the story, I feel like it would have been a lot more productive and useful to read the book first. At the beginning of the film you are just watching the ""lives of others"" for about 50 minutes, and while that would be entertaining for the people who like films in such a setting, I personally couldn't see where the plot was going at all; and so you end up confused as to why you're watching this.My final verdict: a film that can only be fully appreciated if you've read the source novel.

It was fun, lighthearted, and in my opinion had some better lines than this remake (after the picnic when Knightly chastises Emma, and during the declaration of love, to name a few).However I really love this new version and in some ways it's better. The Harriet character is a big improvement over Toni Collette's in the last film (she's a tremendous actress just this wasn't a fitting role for her). The overall youth of the new cast is far more fitting altogether; the 1996 film cast actors older and not as vibrant as they should have been. Anya Taylor-Joy is breathtaking, she has a curious way about her that makes her surprising and refreshing to watch. Also the music is far superior in this rendition.",Emma.
133,Braindead09,Not that interesting,5,15 February 2020,"Watched the film, then read the novel synopsis, seems a fair adaptation. Truth be told the story is dull as ditchwater, the dialogue corny, way to much reliance on overlong stretches of dance routines. But for the terrible dialogue the actors do their best, Ana and Mia pull strong performances, the annoying personality Miranda Hart actually steals the show with the picnic scene. I would have sooner followed the background story of Fairfax and Churchill with Emma poking her nose in as a support character. The use of traditional folk music and period music was a highlight. The production values are good. My conclusion is that life was probably more interesting and fulfilling being a penniless pauper struggling than living life in the monied upper middle classes with the same people at the same parties day in day out.",Emma.

What I learnt from watching this film is that you probably need a good sounding in the characters and their relationship before you can fully grasp the cleverness of the story. And in this regard this is the film's failing, so much is left out and the clipped US/English dialogue is so unclear in some places that I felt at the end I had watched a outstanding story but didn't get it!.Now after having watched the BBC 2009 version over four parts it is clear that this is probably the only version that captures the cleverness and essence of the story , indeed all the characters are fleshed out. I have no idea what poor old Bill Nighy was doing in the 2020 version - he came out with no impact on the story, had very little dialogue and was almost a caricature of himself - but in the 2009 version, the father has an important role to play in the story.All this having been said, I am glad I watched it for its production values and introduction to the Emma story, but it could have been done much better.",Emma.

And all of a sudden Knightly falls in love in one dance after knowing her for so long?? Most scenes jump cut so abruptly. One scene Harriet is somehow waling being carried by that rich guy Emma likes (Churchill??) with a hurt leg??? in the daylight but after the ball and was carried for miles??? Screaming about being in love...but then forever later in the movie - she mentions something about how that was just Gypsies???? Gypsies. A wild band of marauding Gypsies in the English country side in a jane Austin movie. So a wild band of Gypsies jumped their carriage and ....then Churchill carried her for 30 miles to...Emma's????? It's just so odd - it's hard to even know what is happening much less why. It's such a staggeringly simple story - not really sure how such an effort to make it an overly stylish unique version buried the sweetness of the story. The actors all do their part but it just doesn't track or make you care - Sense and sensibility and pride and prejudice have such a human through line. This is just ...well, weird.and $19.99 to rent in amazon! Ugh.",Emma.

137,taylor_king-890-815491,Emma is Gorgeous Funny,8,7 March 2020,"We loved this movie! The actors do a great job balancing the sensibility of the 1800's society with humor over its absurdity. High marks to the director and screenwriter for capturing Emma's author, Jane Austen, so beautifully. As much as we enjoyed character portrayals, we equally loved the scene design, costumes, location settings and staging. There are numerous scenes that show subtle touches of romances blossoming, especially a dance sequence at a ball held for visiting son Franklin Churchill. And overall, there is the fun the audience gets from watching an abundance of communication miscues and their consequences. Last, but not least, Emma actress and several other characters had very large eyes which we get to see express so much suppressed emotion that reflect the times.",Emma.
138,BornKnight,Excellent Production in a Somewhat Boring Story,7,30 May 2020,"""Emma."" (2020) is a light historic comedy / drama movie, directed by Autumn de Wilde (American photographer and film maker, of other movies like The Postmen Dreams and Rilo Kiley), based on a 1815 book of the same name by Jane Austen, which incidentally already had a 1996 film of the same name (with Gwyneth Paltrow, Alan Cumming, Toni Collette, Ewan McGregor). The adaptation was made by Eleanor Catton (from the newly released New Zealand series ""The Luminaries"").The movie, which is said to be very faithful to the book (which I have not read), follows the life of Emma Woodhouse, a wealthy family girl in the countryside (of the social class landed gentry who lives on rents and had a huge country house) from England of the Georgian/ Regency era, who in her small town have a hobby as the matchmaker for her friends and family - sometimes with disastrous results. It is a slow movie, but adequate to the century that it was written, but not so adequate to our current era standards, being almost entirely based on dialogues. The film is somewhat slow and dull till halfway, when it begins to get more interesting by the clumsy situations that Emma creates.In the cast, Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma (Peaky Blinders, Slit, Glass, The Witch), Johnny Flynn, Josh O'Connor, Callum Turner, Mia Goth (Suspiria, A Cure for Wellness, Everest) and Miranda Hart. All with competent performances, especially in a movie with a more theatrical and speech-based style; Anya have a good performance, with the facial expressions in addition to the speech lines. The film's music is by Isobel Waller-Bridge (Flea Bag, War & Peace, Vita and Virginia, Vanity Fair), and David Schweitzer and uses many period songs with period choirs and instruments, including several songs from the English folk duet of Maddy Prior and June Tabor. Perfect for the movie by the way, with songs that really have soul.The cinematography is by Christopher Blauvelt (First Cow, I am Michael, Zodiac), another highlight of the film, using shots with good compositions, with lots of symmetry and contrast of character and elements in the shots, in addition to a clever use of the vibrant colors and pastels used at the time and the blue and green of the lawns of England of the early 19th century. Along with this, Alexandra Byrne's work as costume designer is excellent (Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Avengers, Phantom of the Opera, Murder at the Orient Express, Elizabeth: The Golden Age), studied and reproduced truthfully the clothes of that period, another strong point in the movie.Conclusion: the movie have a great production with emphasis on costumes, music and cinematography, along with good performances, and a good adaptation of the story, which perhaps isn't something thrilling to the audience on our current century standards, even being a work of such a celebrated author. The movie is very slow, and maybe a little too shallow and mundane (I dare to make an analogy with the TV series of the lives of those rich ""celebrities"" that we see today, but in another era). It would give a score of 6.5 to 7.0 / 10.0 for the movie, more to the side of 7.0 because of the beautiful production.",Emma.
139,c-70880,The film is not brilliant enough,7,11 April 2020,"Although this version of the plot is nothing new, witty and romantic. British pastoral scenery, the restoration of classical temperament makes the film look like a bright and colorful oil painting, visually very pleasing. Mr Knightley's casting is far from gwyneth's version of Jeremy north, both in appearance and temperament.",Emma.
140,anniemarshallster,Relax and enjoy this riff on Emma,10,9 April 2020,"Emma is a spoiled little rich girl living a parochial existence in a rural backwater where she leads society, such as it is - according to Jane Austen's text.
She is bored but insufficiently educated or naturally intelligent to find something useful to do, so meddles rather dangerously in peoples' lives.
The film takes this unpromising material and makes a true comedy from it - the italianate 18th C style operatic music underlining her walk down the corridor telling you right from the start that this is an artifice, a game, an entertainment - And I was very entertained.
Anya Taylor-Joy has the perfect little ""cat that got the cream"" face and Johnny Flynn's Queen Bee song over the end credits tells us that she has has indeed got all the cream to be had.
The Gypsy Rose Lee reversé that Johnny Flynn undertakes is amusing. Never has a male leg looked so seductive with a stocking being drawn up it.
Another enjoyable moment was the introduction of Mrs Elton dressed as a wasp and (gasp) occupying the front pew. Incidentally Mr Knightley seems to spare himself church-going duties - one of those new-fangled deists perhaps?
Read this film as an ironic divertisement - a confection for your pleasure.",Emma.
141,sharifahzahira,Just so slow and boring,4,3 January 2021,Watched this the 2nd time as my 1st attempt was halfway. All i can say is i guess i just wasted my time watching.,Emma.
142,merril444,Not the best adaptation,5,16 February 2020,"Unfortunately for me, this version of Emma was more a miss than a hit. It was too slow & failed to draw me in. Some of the scenes were just too long or superfluous, making me wish for them to hurry up to get to the good bits. Visually speaking it was lovely & depicted the Regency period well. But the soundtrack was often jarring & distracting rather than enhancing a scene. The odd choir singing is a case in point.I could not like Emma herself. Anya Taylor-Joy was miscast, in my opinion. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it was her unusual eyes? I know I disliked her hairstyles intensely. Horrid! I couldn't connect with her character.I thought some of the characters were wishy washy. You would not know that Emma's sister Isabella is married to Mr Knightly's brother John. Or perhaps I blinked & missed it? Jane Fairfax was fairly insipid & there was not much to indicate that Frank Churchill was a bit of a cad weaving elaborate lies. Bill Nighy's Mr Woodhouse was too childish & effeminate for my liking. Mr Knightly, whilst likeable, was a bit childish for his age & station & not a match for this particular Emma & I could picture her walking all over him.The actors I did enjoy were the characters of Mrs Weston, Harriet Smith & Miss Bates, played by Gemma Whelan, Mia Goth & Miranda Hart. Gemma Whelan of Game of Thrones fame, handled Mrs Weston with dignity & grace. Harriet was delightful & suitably innocent & gullible. My favourite character in this adaption was Miranda Hart's portrayal of the unfortunate Miss Bates. Miranda is an expert at playing socially awkward characters & did not disappoint with Miss Bates. Her embarrassment & vulnerability at Emma's spiteful words at the picnic brought me to tears. As did her graciousness in accepting Emma's attempt at an apology. Bravo Miranda!So there were some redeeming scenes throughout the movie. But overall, it fell short of my expectations & the 1996 version of Emma remains my favourite to date.",Emma.

144,Flippitygibbit,All bonnet and no breeches,6,15 February 2020,"Autumn de Wilde's Emma, with Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn, is not my cup of tea, I'm afraid. My review might be influenced by how much I love Jane Austen's novel and how many times I've watched the 2009 miniseries, but I always give every adaptation a try. And I can't really judge if what I was watching would make sense to an Austen virgin, shall we say, so what seemed disjointed and rushed to me might work perfectly for others.I'll start with the good: I loved the costumes and the interiors, which were sumptuously beautiful. The wood-shaving ringlets on the women and the high collars on the men were distracting, though. And of course Anya Taylor-Joy made for a quirky and regal Emma (Austenites will be pleased to note that she has perfect posture.) I also loved how Anya Taylor-Joy and Amber Anderson as Jane actually played the pianoforte during the Coles' party (but could have done without Mr Knightley's contribution, when Frank Churchill is supposed to be singing with Jane). BUT. The music was horrendously jarring, alternating between Hanna Barbera cartoon incidentals and freakish folk music. The supporting characters suffered once again - I couldn't honestly tell the difference between Mrs Weston, Mrs Knightley and Mrs Elton, except that Isabella was for some reason a complete cow in this version, and Mr Elton and Frank Churchill were also interchangeable (perhaps that's why Elton never seemed to be without his dog collar, to help tell them apart). Bill Nighy's Mr Woodhouse was a weird combination of fusspot and Edwardian fop, and Johnny Flynn's Mr Knightley strayed way off character by stripping off in his first scene and never really recovered for me. (Apparently, that was a way of 'humanising' the character because he is always 'mansplaining' - very woke.) Anya wasn't kidding when she talked about the focus being on 'bodily functions', by the way - not only are we 'treated' to Knightley's backside, but Emma hitches up her skirts to warm her bare arse by the fire, and the 'cannot make speeches' proposal scene is a bloody mess. Literally. The script leans so heavily on lines from the novel that I think Eleanor Catton thought she was writing an essay for an English Lit exam - Austenites will be happy, but there was no feeling behind any of the grand words. When Emma and Mr Knightley argue, they constantly shout over each other, for instance, instead of the usual playful back and forth.The whole film felt like a weird mashup between a stage musical and a Victorian farce, with choreographed servants and slapstick humour. There was also a lot of 1996 Emma in there, taking pastel and pastoral scenery from the film and Andrew Davies' wearisome obsession with wealth from the television two-parter. Not on a sliding scale of Emma and Miss Bates, but in how Mr Knightley's strawberry picking party turns into a National Trust promotional video for Wilton House, Salisbury. There's also a lot of emphasis on servants dressing their masters and mistresses, presumably to fit in more scenes of 'natural nudity'.I went, I watched, I did my duty to Emma. But I think I'll stick with the 2009 miniseries.",Emma.
145,SB100,Well worth seeing,8,18 February 2020,"I have previously seen three TV versions of Emma, and the 1990s Hollywood film with Gwyneth Paltrow - which I find excessively sentimental. Emma is not my favourite Austen novel, but the adaptation used for the 2020 film version is generally very good. One or two specifics are omitted, but this is inevitable in compression to the running time of just over two hours.As all reviews have noted, the film is beautifully designed and shot. Some of the design may even be thought to be over the top, but I thought that was consonant with the mannered approach of the cast, an approach which works well in making this essentially a comedy of manners as well as a love story. The detective story element of the novel doesn't go for very much - little is made of the piano, and Frank Churchill's slip in knowing about Dr Perry's carriage is omitted.I thought Mia Goth's well-rounded performance of Harriet the best I have seen, and it is certainly difficult to take one's eyes off Anya Taylor-Joy in the titular lead. Other female performances are perhaps more so-so, although Chloe Pirie's harassed Isabella is interesting. The comedic Mr Elton would be well over the top in some adaptations but just about fits in here. Other male roles are adequately filled even though the portrayal of john Knightly is slightly bizarre. Bill Nighy is...well, Bill Nighy, this time with amazing costume.I enjoyed it, and I intend to see it again soon. Overall I would just favour the 1996 Kate Beckinsale ITV version but this is close behind and in some ways better",Emma.
146,bobbsaunders,Ill Judged in almost every respect,2,23 February 2020,"This is a film to forget even for those who clearly worked so hard on it. The outcome just has no purpose. Its only slight saving grace ( which was the reason for giving it two stars) was the cinemaphotography, which was at times very good. But as a story, screenplay, drama, or even as they claim, comedy, it fails totally. Not one character is appealing, you therefore care little what happens to them. The storyline meanders along, giving no sense of tension. There are injections of jauntiness that appear disconnected to the rest of the script and performances. The theatrically named director, Autumn de Wilde, seems to have misjudged just about every aspect he had control of. Thats a death sentence for any movie.",Emma.
147,harryhoustonastros,Fantastic,8,17 February 2020,"Fun, stylistic, and is basically everything I wanted from the film. The color palette was absolutely gorgeous. I really enjoyed this film and I think any audience member will If they are into period pieces",Emma.
148,kdycer,What did I just watch?!,4,12 December 2020,"Messy adaption of one of Austen's classics. I've never read the book and maybe that's why I found it hard to follow. The story jumps all over the place and never really gives the audience a chance to connect to the characters. It lacks any real charm or emotion, the characters are very one dimensional and not at all likeable. (Nighy not included) Emma is just plain horrible! There were times when I felt like I was watching a bad Ealing comedy. Doesn't live up to the hype.",Emma.
149,ccandlily,The movie I saw recently that I think is not bad.,7,9 April 2020,"Almost all the heroines of Jane Austen's novels have this nature, proud and kind and lovely. In real life Jane Austen was unmarried all her life, and in the movie novels her heroines all found their own happiness. This has to be said to be a fate. In this movie, Emma is keen to give people a red line as a matchmaker. She is very enthusiastic! But she also carries the arrogance of the upper class. She looked down on the working people at the bottom and made her friends miss the love that belonged to her. Emma was jealous of Jane's talent, but she also looked down on her nagging aunt. Finally Emma looked inside herself and found that it was all wrong because these people were very friendly to her.Birth is not everything that tests a person. Emma realized this. She went to say sorry to Jane's little aunt. She also went to make an effort for her friend's love. In the end, Emma also got her own happiness. This movie has many places to laugh, but also moved. But the picture is very beautiful, inside the hero's clothing is particularly beautiful. There is a sense of black humor.",Emma.
150,pwmoores-49444,Enjoyable,7,25 February 2020,This was a pleasant and entertaining film which is well paced. A good soundtrack. Emma is not a character I particularly warm to but the film generates sympathy for her.,Emma.
151,TheCheeseMistress,"Beautiful to look at, but that's it",6,20 December 2020,"The main thing you should know about this film is that it's 100% talking and 0% actions.
Right from the start we're bombarded with an overwhelming stream of names and facts that keep you in a constant state of confusion, trying to figure out who's who and wondering if you're even supposed to incorporate all that information to begin with or if the intention is just to show us the characters gossiping about random stuff to set up the story and illustrate what a normal day is like for them without the dialogues themselves being relevant. To save you a headache: no, none of it is relevant.But that blank talk is all there is. In fact, the whole movie is an extremely simple story that could be summed up in a single sentence, only that buried in two hours of people talking at an insanely fast pace without saying anything.Anya's character is completely emotionless, I could never tell what she was thinking, what anyone was thinking or what was happening at all since all we're shown is robots that just won't stop talking.
Until it ends, and you couldn't care less about it.",Emma.

153,fayandray,Visually Stunning Not Enough,3,31 May 2020,"I watch every Emma adaptation, and was looking forward to this one. Right away the costumes and sets were amazing to see on the screen. However, just as quickly, I realized that there's an underlying snark masked as wit to it. From the period at the end of the title and chapter titles, to Anna Taylor-Joy's overly-directed facial reactions.I know that Emma, as Jane Austen wrote, ""would not be much liked by anyone"". However, every other version manages to make her likable by portraying her as more oblivious, rather than having a superiority complex. Not here though; it was successful in making Austen's statement true. Harriet and Ms. Bates are played well here, but every other character's portrayal are almost cartoonish. Mr. Knightley is certainly not the older gentleman in this version.As a story, I would have been confused as a first-time viewer. It was disjointed, seemed to focus on the sumptuousness rather than the arc and relied on music to convey tone. It concerns me that this is how period pieces will be filmed from now on.It gets a 3 from me only because of the visuals, but overall, I'm disappointed. I ended up fast forwarding through it, because I was bored. The 1996 Emma is still my favorite, and the 2009 BBC version far outshines this one.",Emma.

""Emma."" grabbed those rich people problems (like considering matchmaking between rich families the most important thing in the world. Oh and fear of bad weather) and made a movie that's a lot funnier than it should be.It still is just a period drama, so nothing really exciting happens and it gets boring by the end, but it doesn't mean that we can't giggle at it like we saw someone grab the wrong fork on a 18th century dinner party.Also, the Oscar for ""Best Costume"" is given. Is there even a chance of it going to any other movie?

Emma in the midst of all the mess that she combines has a sweet heart that I don't find here.
The most part of the main characters in this version are rendered worse than in 1996's one with the remarkable exception of Mia Goth>Harriet Smith... really delicious. And in this case it's the opposite: Toni Collette was in no way suitable for the role of the naive Harriet in the 1996's one.

I guess I'm not an Anya Taylor-Joy fan, as I didn't like her in the chess movie either. Those big googly eyes just creep me out--I keep expecting to see her grow fangs and start biting people on the neck.

160,dswhitcomb,Made me want to revisit Clueless,4,26 October 2020,"Ok, I have never read Jane Austin's Emma and I had never watched any version of the novel except for Clueless which is loosely based on Austin's book. It's not that I don't read but the book never interested me at all. When I saw the trailer for this, the most recent version, I was interested in finally learning why there are soooooo many adaptations of this story. Let me tell you, I wasn't impressed.If I had never seen Clueless I would have a very hard time understanding the plot line. There are so many characters thrown at you during this 2 hour rom-com that I couldn't keep track of all the names. I felt like not one was fleshed out very well. I also had a hard time trying to see the attraction between Emma and Mr. Knightly for whom she ends up loving in the end. There were too many characters with similar names and styles that I never felt connected to any of them. The only reason I knew that Emma was in love with Mr. Knightly is because, again, I watched Clueless and I figured out that Knightly was the Paul Rudd character because they casually mention not being real brother and sister.I found the actress playing Emma didn't embody the energy that I would assume Austin gave her to show why we care about Emma. I really didn't empathize with her at all. Her looks are a bit sallow to show charm. I love Miranda Hart as Miss Bates but that was about it. The other actors were just playing it for genteel laughs. I like the idea of this story as it was written during a time when women were expected to fill a certain role and nothing more. If the character of Emma found herself in 2020, she probably wouldn't find it hard to find her way but I digress. The visuals were wonderful and I love the costuming though I felt some of Emma's clothing choices were a bit underwhelming for someone who is supposed to display wealth. Also the music choices are very odd. I felt like the director wanted a little Wes Anderson vibe but didn't hit the mark.So now I find myself wanting to do a deep dive and find a better version of this story as I am wondering why so many versions have been attempted. I'll start by rewatching Clueless then try to watch the Gwyneth Paltrow version but that may be as I really can't stomach her. Or maybe I'll just do the old fashioned method and read a book.",Emma.

I think it was excellent. I was v. Skeptical about Anya Taylor-Joy, having so recently watched her in Queen's Gambit and--just yesterday!--The New Mutants. I didn't think I could really see her as Emma. It took 10-20 minutes. I don't even know when it changed over, because I was so engrossed. All the rest of the casting was inspired. It's hardest with the famous folks, but everyone here did well. Miranda Hart was superb as Miss Bates. Bill Nighy was an excellent choice for Mr. Woodhouse. Mr. Weston/Inspector Lestrade was probably the hardest for me to get used to, but Rupert Graves did well. My only quibble about casting is that Mr. Knightley is supposed to be so remarkably tall, and here he was about the same height as Emma. Well, Johnny Flynn did a great job anyway.The visuals were beautiful. I was a bit surprised and the similarity of clothes for Mr. Knightley and Mr. Martin, and for Emma and Harriet. Also, how at the ball, some of the ladies were wearing gloves and some were not. What's up with that?Changes and omissions. I was disappointed not to have the benefit of any of Mrs. Elton's hilarious chatter at the strawberry-picking party at Donwell Abbey. You couldn't even tell that it was a strawberry-picking party at all, anyway! And the word games where Frank Churchill was passing secrets to Jane Fairfax--that is a good part that I missed. One omission that I applaud is Emma's spreading the idea that there was something inappropriate between Jane and Mr. Dixon. That was cringey even in the book!Overall, I liked it very much. Kate Beckinsale will always be the best movie Emma to me, but Anya Taylor-Joy is a worthy successor.",Emma.

This b'tch, spoiled and haughty has so much to learn and teach- and the... Frivolity of it all is so obvious in this rendition. The characters being.... Pardon me but not conventionally attractive I think adds to the character and helps the watcher see how class rules all. Cash is king.

170,rehabdoc,Lol... I love this and most people missed the biggest change...,10,31 October 2020,"I love this version. It is my favorite screen version in fact (and I have really enjoyed all of them, including Clueless).I think a lot of people seemed to have missed the most important difference of this version, though the reviewer here did mention the realism and visceral nature.What I see as the most important change is Instead of the usual hiding and glossing over of the mechanics underpinning the romanticized world and era, inhabited by the charming main characters, where some kind of invisible magic allows these people to spend their lives in idle gossip and melodrama... de Wilde and Catton choose to ironically place the upstairs/downstairs nature of daily life right in every gorgeous and cluttered scene. The servants hustling to make all this happen, you see their faces, the expression of the effort, the privilege of the people who take them for granted, the class disparity, in the backdrop of the most gorgeous world of all the versions I've watched. But it's not meant to make the main characters look unsympathetic or cruel; it's just beyond their radar. And given Emma's entire plotting is informed by class and her perception of class, it's a very welcome layer of complexity.I think a lot of the extreme negativity (in IMDb reviews user reviews) towards this movie, and comments about the main characters in this version being charmless, comes from viewers being subliminally put off by the oblivious interactions of the main characters with their omnipresent servants, which also colors perception of Emma's actual dialog about class. Interestingly the many reviewers seem to find Bill Nighy casually treating the omnipresent servants like they are Alexa the automated house, and give him a pass. Reviewers judge women more harshly.Most productions of Emma discreetly put the servants off the screen via closeups on the main characters, and cut off their heads, or make them leave the room etc., so you just perceive the movie and scenes to have not actually contained all these other people.This version of Emma doesn't judge Emma and her fellow privileged class... it allows you to appreciate the narrative strictly from their point of view, and she is charming and empathetic and naive and well intentioned in that light. But the second narrative they ironically stares us in the face the whole time, is the spoiled, privileged, life melodrama and life of leisure they are all living, as the servants, in frame, scramble to make it all possible.I think it's more realistic, and a much needed realism, that is usually deliberately glossed over. It is usually glider over in order to be able to continue to romanticize the era and enjoy the whimsical fantasy nature of these period stories. This version of Emma is kind of a post-Downton Abbey (which while trying to more realistically portray upstairs downstairs and the critiques of this privileged aristocracy, still took an overly romantic view of the landed), Parasite era awareness (complex problems of class through a modern eye), take on Emma.It's enjoyable still on a straight story level, acting is top notch, and definitely my favorite screen version of Emma.",Emma.
171,beckyheth,Extravagant. Miserable. Mind-numbing. Austentacious!,5,29 November 2020,"Absolutely beautiful costuming and sets. Terrible casting. The script is excellent and follows the book accurately. The score is atrocious, with the exception of ""Drink to Me Only"". (There were musical selections that were nothing short of jarring.)
The costume designers deserve 10 stars, as do the sets.
I will recommend the BBC miniseries which was not as elegant but much easier on the senses.",Emma.
172,sipa_p,Utterly miscast and charmless,2,24 February 2020,"This film is so utterly miscast. There is no chemistry bewtween Emma and Knightley, Emma is charmless, Knightley is generic, Frank churchill unappealing (just remember Ewan McGregor!) and the thing that Billy Nighy always does is somehow bland. A ruined classic.",Emma.
173,rtipping68,Just plain boring,2,2 May 2020,I'm not going to waffle on about the book or compare that with this film adaptation. I don't want to go into lengthy analysis of the main characters either. I admit I did not manage to watch it to the end as I had other things I could watch. All I can say is as a film it was not funny and rather boring.,Emma.
174,ang-61989,Loved it!,9,22 March 2020,Loved this movie. Such attraction and chemistry between Emma and Mr Knightley. Give it a watch and enjoy.,Emma.
175,mgmason-28337,Enjoyed,7,7 December 2020,Seemed a bit slow at first but really enjoyed. Great scenery and photography. Bill Nighy superb. Taylor-Joy did not get drunk or take drugs or kill people. So an unusual sight of her. She is a great actress,Emma.
176,nastja97,"A lovely new version, though not without faults",8,16 October 2020,"After the mixed ratings, I didn't expect too much and was pleasantly surprised. In fact, while the Kate Beckinsale version still is firmly my favourite, this one is definitely worth watching and rewatching and probably my next favourite adaptation after the one with Beckinsale (I thought the miniseries with Romola Garai beautifully filmed but in the end strangely forgettable; I do like Emma Approved but it obviously stands apart as a modern-day reimagining).There are, I admit, some major negatives:
1) The over-the-top comic moments, such as loud squealing and yelling. It isn't funny, just annoying.
2) Frank and Jane are sidelined completely, so there is almost nothing of the ship tease between Emma and Frank or of Emma's envy of Jane.
3) Isabella. Oh dear, Isabella. First Emma Approved turns John abusive, and now this adaptation goes the other way and turn Isabella into a cartoonish parody of Mrs. Bennet. I understand the need to flesh out their characters, but it surely can be done without turning them unnecessarily villainous.
4) Johnny Flynn gives a generally good portrayal of Mr. Knightley, but:
a) his character is way too hysterical in most of the dramatic moments;
b) the stripping scene. It's not just that it was entirely gratuitous. There's simply a thing called an establishing character moment. In the 1997 ITV adaptation, the first we see of Mr. Knightley is him greeting a servant like a friend and asking about his family. Here, the first we see of Mr. Knightley is him being undressed by servants whose presence he doesn't even acknowledge.And now for the positives:
1) Emma's actress. Anya Taylor-Joy utterly nails it, managing to capture all the many sides of Emma's nature and her character development.
2) Harriet actually seeing that Emma loves Mr. Knightley herself and calling her out on her actions. Quite refreshing for a character who usually behaves like a sheep ready to be led wherever offered.
3) Emma apologising to Robert Martin in person (she insists on doing it herself instead of delegating the task to Mr. Knightley!) and giving him her sketch of Harriet. This was a really sweet idea.
4) Emma and Harriet's friendship as a whole. For once, it felt more like a genuine friendship than merely like Emma patronising her new project.
5) The romance arcs of Mr. Knightley/Emma and Robert/Harriet. In my opinion, both of them were depicted very charmingly.
6) In particular: Mr. Knightley and Emma stealing a moment to be alone together by hiding behind a screen on the pretext of hiding from drafts. Aw.
7) The costuming and the scenery, both gorgeous.",Emma.

But after 30 minutes of this movie, it is so freaking boring that I just cannot stand continue watching it.Nothing happens. What is the reason for this movie? It is not drama, it is not comedy, it does not relay anything that is interesting from a historical perspective.The movie is so boring and without meaning that it never should have been made and not worth wasting time on.Shame on the people making stupid movies like this. They should never be allowed to dabble in the movie business again.",Emma.
178,MsCateArcher,I really liked it.,9,11 September 2020,"Emma was well acted, funny, authentic and beautiful. I enjoyed it very much. Anya Taylor Joy is an amazing actress, all actors were really good,perfect casting. The cinematography was perfect, the costumes, the detail, the music all were really good. I can't understand the bad reviews, don't be discouraged by them.",Emma.
179,nesdon-2,Disjointed mostly charming mishmash,6,7 March 2020,"The costumes, hair and makeup, and decoration badly upstage the performances and plot, though it still manages to retain most of Austen's commentary, nuance, and humor. The sound track is emblematic of this disunity, shifting without much rationale between the most flippant little tinklings, the sacred, and folksy. About half way through, Emma's unusually repulsive shallowness and arrogance gave way to some sympathy and insight, and my revulsion at the mise en scene surrendered to the subtle warmth of Nighy and Anya Joy' relationship. Weird disorienting experience.",Emma.
180,arndt-pawelczik,A socialist manifesto?,10,19 April 2020,"In the 1929 Soviet propaganda film THE NEW BABYLON the Paris bourgeoisie are watching from a hill as the Paris commune is being brutally crushed. The film effectively contrasts the idle rich feasting above with the workers being slaughtered below. In Autumn de Wilde's EMMA we find a not dissimilar scene with the genteel society of the town lounging lazily on a hill to enjoy the view. This time the contrast needs no cross-cutting as the film makes sure we see enough of the servants whose unrecognized work makes this idleness possible. Throughout EMMA we find these sly little vignettes of servants carrying out menial tasks: dressing or undressing the named characters, serving food or placing screens for Emma's eccentric father. The film makes it quite clear that a society as preposterous as regency England's has these two sides to it: the hard-working real people and the hothouse flowers like Emma Woodhouse (who - by the way - we first encounter in her own hothouse picking flowers). And while those at the top of the social ladder in this film talk incessantly, those at the lower end never get to speak, neither the servants nor the salt-of-the-earth farmer Mr Martin. An exception seems to be Mr Knightley's servant, who reprimands him for walking rather than using his carriage. And here we have it: Mr Knightley is different, more real than the rest of the gentility. He goes out riding with Mr Martin the farmer and we are told he cares more for his tenant farmers than his grand house, where normally all the stately rooms are closed up. And it is Mr Knightley, in the scene on the hill, who reminds Emma Woodhouse of her privileged position.
Unlike in Greta Gerwig's LITTLE WOMEN, however, here the wokeness and subtle political messages add to rather than distract from telling the story. De Wilde has simply identified these messages in the novel and put them on display in her direction. That means that the film can still revel and luxuriate it decors, costumes and jewelry, these elements simply take on a different meaning.
Add to that the fact that the acting, direction and camerawork are wonderful throughout, the writing is razor-sharp and the whole thing is wonderfully tongue-in-cheek, and you have an extremely enjoyable up-to-date adaptation of a much-beloved novel.",Emma.
181,sessedup,"Stars for costumes, but not for the acting",4,13 November 2020,"Okay, I saw a feature for this movie in Vogue prior to its release, and now I know why. Another reviewer called the costumes and sets ""sumptuous."" Yes, that is the word.However, all of the characters were caricatures. Even the brilliant Bill Nighy and Rupert Graves couldn't do much with the weird lines and characteristics their men were assigned.
I was disappointed, too, by the foolishness of Elton and even Harriet. They are, admittedly, both foolish in the novel, but in there it's at least believable that Emma might return Elton's affections, or that Knightley might return Harriet's. In the movie, both characters were way over the top, so there was no real tension driving the plot forward, which is a disservice to the subtleties of Austen's fiction, I think. I won't even get started on the fake news that was Frank/Emma's coy flirtation.I could go on but I won't. All I'll say is watch the BBC miniseries with Romola Garai as Emma. Vain and arrogant though Emma Woodhouse may be, at least you won't detest her within the first five minutes.",Emma.

183,lsatterth,Emma,9,26 August 2020,"This iteration of Emma is one of the best adaptations on Jane Austen's works to date. I rate with 1995 Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle), and 2008 Sense and Sensibility (Hattie Moran & Charity Wakefield) as a well written, well-directed, delightful movie. Ayna Taylor-Joy as Emma is not only convincing but absolutely irritating, in a good way, in her smug arrogance of what she believes superior thinking and judgment. Taylor-Joy brings out the claws of jealousy very well. Emma's humbling is more believable as other adaptations simply made Emma appear to regret that she didn't get what she wanted, not a real reformation. Superb performance.
Everyone in the cast did an excellent job and truly brought their characters to life. Even though some artistic license has been taken, it doesn't deviate from the overall story written by Ms. Austen.
I highly recommend this movie and will watch it again and again!!",Emma.

185,thiwankar1,It's not a bad movie at all but not the best either,7,31 December 2020,"This is a good movie to watch but the first hour is kinda boring and the portrayal of the characters could have been done a tad better because some of them had no depth like the Father's character (which I am sure is a very lovable and amusing character in the book, I never read). Latter part of the movie is very interesting. Main actress does her part very well. Beautiful cinematography and average writing I must say cause the first 20-30 mins I paused the movie several times to make some tea, scroll through FB and stuff cause I was bored. But it was worth it to have stuck with it until the end cause it picks up after a while. Then it's very interesting indeed.",Emma.
186,bcirilli,Very nice film,7,22 December 2020,I recommend actually paying some attention at the beginning at least so you know who everyone is.

I liked it overall and enjoyed the grumpiness of her father!,Emma.
187,aylwardpaul,Better,9,5 October 2021,"Prior to this, I had always rated the Gwyneth Paltrow/Jeremy Northam film the best of the ""Emma""s (The non-period piece ""Clueless"" is also highly regarded). However I think that this 2020 adaptation is now the best of the bunch.It is earthier than the many other versions that I have seen. The characters' makeup, hair and outfits all look more realistic, and less Hollywood. The actors are generally less attractive too. Added to this the set design is very artistic in capturing the period look, and some folk songs are thrown in to assist with the mood. This all leads to a more genuine feel for the era in which it is set.The story is unchanged, but there is a greater subtlety to the events, and the blossoming affection between the two leads is better handled.Recommended.",Emma.
188,mmsbk,Pretty good actually,8,19 February 2020,"Well,I liked this version , not perfect but very watchable. I was not familiar with Anya Taylor-Joy and at first was distracted by her , to me, un-Emma ish looks . I got over that though and found her rather good . Johnny Flynn's Mr Knightly was, I thought , not anywhere near dignified and dictatorial enough and not really old enough either, but he is so watchable and fun that I got over that too.
Bill Nighy as Mr Woodhouse was very interesting casting - he played him as endearing , even loveable, and eccentric rather the selfish hypochondriacal old misery the book portrayed . But I love Bill Nighy and he can do no wrong as far as I am concerned. Miranda Hart as Miss Bates , also interesting. Too young and not really boring enough but a delight anyway.I do not understand another reviewer not being able to tell some characters apart - Mrs and Mrs Elton for eg, are sui generis and played excellently. Harriet Smith too . I did agree that it was odd that Emma's sister Isabella and her husband the younger Mr Knightly are portrayed as having a seriously acrimonious marriage , not at all what I remember from the novel , where she was certainly neurotic about colds and stuff but Mr John Knightly was kind of amused and tolerant.So , all in all, I liked it and found it not at all parodic or without substance.
Oh and costume and location just sumptuous . Actually I don't remember the Woodhouse residence as being THAT sumptuous , but eh...",Emma.
189,rosebx-60362,Hard to hear,3,18 August 2020,"Apart from not being the usual Emma we've been used to in previous TV and movie versions, Anya Taylor-Joy's Emma has a voice that is very hard to hear. I could clearly hear every word the other actors were saying but without subtitles I couldn't clearly understand a lot of what she was saying. It seems clarity of speach in modern productions are no longer a priority. Much like the well documented mumbling of Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley.",Emma.
190,GranHotellover,The book come to life,9,27 April 2020,"The cinematography that you see in the trailers is abundant in the film. Beautiful set, costumes, camera work and direction. It is also such a relief to see that the costumes and hair styles have been researched. Hopefully other period dramas will learn from this that staying true to the way people actually looked during this era is not a sacrifice on the beauty of the costume. After many years of just seeing pieces of hair fall at the front of an updo, we also get to see ringlets of the regency era!Onto the plot, the plot is pretty much as Jane Austen would have wanted it. It carries her constant theme of mocking regency society with all it's peculiar unwritten rules. The language also has a similar intelligence and wit shown in the books. However I do feel that for the casual viewer who isn't interested in classic literature or reading up on History, I think they may find this adaptation a little cold. I've heard some people say they expected it to be funnier, I would say it is more accurate to say it is full of wit rather than laugh out loud funny. I also know many people are used to masses of passion in period drama romance the so called 'bodice ripping' passion, this is not that kind of film. This drama carries the subtle romance and friendship of l classic literature and I have to say even as someone who can appreciate them staying true to the books, I did find the chemistry between the two leads a little bit lacking. That's just a nitpick though and overall I loved it. 9/10",Emma.
191,ceasentry,Meh...,5,23 May 2020,"Even though I'm no fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, this 2020 version cannot hold a candle to the 1996 adaptation. It's silly, too long and boring. And Mr. Knightley? Dear God, are there no good looking men left in England??? Theo James would have been perfect for this role! I love a good friends to lovers story, but detected no chemistry whatsoever between the characters of Emma and Mr. Knightley. None. The musical ""intermissions"" seemed out of place and out of period and jarred me out of the story. And the scene under the tree when Mr. Knightley finally confesses his love, a nosebleed? Seriously? WTH? Oh, and the character of Mr. Martin? He just seemed like a wooden bufoon. The final scene had me rolling my eyes. I'm glad I did not go to see this in theatres. Do yourself a favour and watch the 1996 version.",Emma.
192,laura_e_dillon,After Seeing Anya in the Queens Gambit this was disappointing,6,7 November 2020,"Im not exactly sure what it is about this film, maybe the writing or the direction I dont know. But this version of Emma fell a bit flat for me. The choice for Knightly did not seem like the right choice. They could have found someone so much better such as Theo James. He would have fit the part very well. Anya didnt seem to have the opportunity to shine in this like she did in The Queens Gambit. And the jarring out of place music was just odd. Other versions of Emma felt much more life like and fun. Other versions of Emma make her much more bubbly, vivacious and this one she is more snotty and not as interesting as a character. In fact all of the characters did not seem to exhibit as much depth. It was a pleasant film overall and beautiful to watch but I think they could have done a lot better.",Emma.

This one is a fresh take while keeping it in the period.The movie doesn't take the story or itself too seriously, which I find is an approach I prefer and which some have called Wes Anderson-like. Characters reactions and communication of their feelings through slightly over the top facial expressions adds a comical flavour that I enjoyed.The cinematography is vivid with the decor and costumes crisp and beautiful, quite perfect. I feel like they convey social class more clearly than other versions. The aesthetic definitely has a bright, contemporary touch as do a couple more details: showing the male characters' struggles and feelings more than the book and other versions - we see Mr. Knightley getting undressed & dressed as well as privately exasperated with jealousy rather than mysterious and resilient at all times. He's relatable and not inaccessible.Bill Nighy turns Mr. Woodhouse from a hypochondriac bore into an eccentric and participating character in fabulous suits. Anya Taylor Joy has had an absolute breakthrough year and she does a great job. Enjoyed watching Josh O'Connor as a great and funny Mr. Elton after seeing him as Prince Charles in The Crown. Tanya Reynolds is a great Mrs. Elton putting on just the right degree of obnoxious.",Emma.

It's my belief that if you like that movie, you are going to like this movie as well. This movie is a combination of the two to make a comedic period piece. I laughed a lot while watching.",Emma.
200,jatiecrazy,Was never completely with the cast...,5,27 March 2020,Love Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma. Don't really like what's-his-scratched-face as Mr. Knightley.

203,jennydeane,Excellent & Exquisite - A Must See,9,6 March 2020,"Excellent and exquisite. This rendition of Emma knows what it's about and delivers it delightfully. I have to say, here Emma is a real biotch - she is cold and bites hard (in a playful, devilishly cruel kind of way of course). But while she starts off mean as heck, this gives her more opportunity to grow - and by the end of this beautiful movie, you've seen Emma change and mature dramatically.I think it's interesting to note that the '96 version opening scene shows a globe spinning and lightly talks about how ""one's small town is one's world"" - this version of Emma does a superb job showing this truth rather than telling. The ""small town"" feel is pervasive here and relatable. Emma as meddler made more sense: she is painfully bored, has limited friends (most of whom are quite silly), and is incredibly vain. The lavish food and set contribute to this feeling of bored vanity as well.The climax of the movie is well crafted and painful - and everything comes together at once. The Miss Bates incident is especially hard to watch and very personal here, and the conflict with Harriet feels more real and complicated than other versions.I also really enjoyed Mr. Elton - he is complete cringe but not over the top.Very enjoyable - 9/10",Emma.

Emma is like a robot who cannot smile and is rude to everyone. Unlike the charming character Emma should have. I think the actress has not even read the novel.
Mr. Knightly should be in his 30s, but here it looks as if he's 17!!! Very wrong choice for actors and actresses. The make up has even made them look worse.
If I didn't know any better, I thought I was watching a movie by Tim Burton.
Seriously! I think it's the worst adaptation of any of Jane Austin's works (including the cheap Indian adaptations)!",Emma.

The story is a cliche romantic story in which Emma falls in love with an old friend of hers who always been there even through her tough times. However, the movie lacks to show the process of them developing those feelings for each other. Emma goes from an ego head to a ""lost in love"" kind of girl in like 20 minutes. In my opinion, even though the movie is an enjoyable one time watch, it would be a lot better with a more slow paced romantic journey.",Emma.

Anya Taylor Joy as Emma was fantastic- her little glances, movements, head tilts, she was way better than Gwyneth Paltrow.

Have read some reviews and I see no middle ground....2s or 9s..Someone mentions that Mr. Elton is a caricature...this is true so was Mr. Collins. Methinks, Ms. Austen liked to poke fun at the clergy.The nudity reminded me of the wet shirt scene in Pride & Prejudice in 1995 TV adaptation. Didn't bother me. They were naked under all those clothes back then too.I commend the casting, the performances, the costumes, and much more. I always approach Austen movies with trepidation. I always fear disappointment, but that rarely happens and this no exception.The director is a photographer and approached the scenes with a photographer's eye. If you look at the frames, many are beautifully symmetrical photographic portraits. Loved the visuals. I compare it to CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT just in this respect. If you really watch that fabulous Orson Welles movie, the framing looks like the paintings of Dutch Masters (especially the scenes with Fallstaff, Silence, and Shallow out at the country house).No chemistry between the two leads? Well, if you read Austen you know that Knightley is considerably older than Emma and watched her grow up due to the family's connections. Emma and Knightley's siblings are married to each other.Knightley admires her from afar and is betwixt friendship, sibling, buddy, et. al. with Emma. This is played well in the earlier parts of the movie. The attraction develops into more and as Emma ages it is more appropriate. The nuance of this progression is well done.I don't know if I should call certain little gems, Easter Eggs, or hidden meanings. But, I found Harriet's moaning and sighing on the couch after twisting her ankle, well, you know...as Knightley is attending to her foot so clever. I laughed out loud.Well done by all. And I guess after reading some reviews, not all found it thus. I recommend a second viewing.",Emma.
215,Joewho72,Fun Movie with Style.,8,11 March 2020,Had a Old Time Blast Seeing This One. A Very Colorful Movie with Great Style and Costumes!! Loved all The Women's Hair In This Too! The One Unique thing about this Film was it was a Romantic Comedy with Not One Sex Joke. It is Rated PG. This Movie Proves You Can Have Fun and Not Be Raunchy. There Needs to be More Movies Like This.,Emma.
216,kbbond,Pretty to look at but REALLY BORING to watch,3,17 October 2020,"I wasted $5 renting this movie on iTunes. I debating renting it for a long time because I am usually a big fan of period dramas. I was so disappointed, and I didn't even finish the movie before the rental expired. That's how much I didn't care. The film gives you no reason to care about any of the characters or their lives. The main actress who plays Emma is also annoying, I'm sorry but she just doesn't seem right to be in a period piece. Emma Stone would have been a much better choice. Anyways, once again please take my warning and don't watch this movie, it will just be 2 hours of your life you won't get back. Speaking of Emma Stone, watch ""The Favourite"" instead. It has beautiful costumes and characters that actually have personalities.",Emma.
217,tshine-548-66496,Gone for good!,3,10 March 2020,"This was 2.5 hours wasted that I will never get back. Perhaps it was the comparison to the excellent recent adaptation of ""Sanditon"" but this was just a mess, in my opinion. With a silly musical score and hyper-stylized staging, this almost came across as a stage play being filmed.
There was audible snoring in the theatre!",Emma.
218,kennethcbenson,"Gorgeous to look at, delightful",9,10 April 2021,"Where have all these marvelous young actors come from? (Well, the superb Bill Nighy is not young but is - as ever - superb.) And now, thanks to ""The Queen's Gambit,"" we know what a powerhouse Anna Taylor-Joy is. But the rest is the cast is simply perfection.Forget about sainted Jane, this wonderful film stands on its own.Brava to the production and costume designers, to the composers, and above all to the director, Autumn de Wilde. 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼Well done!",Emma.
219,sarah_412,Such a disappointment,2,5 May 2020,"I have always loved Emma! I loved the book. I loved the Masterpiece Theater version. I loved the 1996 version with Paltrow as Emma.I hated this.I hated Emma's character in this. Instead of loving her and cheering her on, I rather wanted a horse to run her over. Emma should be genuine and caring of others. This Emma was selfish and a complete snob. She only cared for herself. She was overtly judgmental. While Emma did display judgment in the other versions and in the book, it wasn't her constant character but rather a low point in her character development.I hated this Emma.I only gave it two stars for the costumes, which were very lovely.",Emma.
220,andrastea,Fancy but a bit cold and unpleasant,4,27 March 2020,"This wasn't a very good adaptation. The story flow was somewhat disjointed and music was strange. Sometimes piano and then it jumped to some sort of religious or gospel music? The story jumps so much that characters remain pretty shallow. Actors just don't have enough time to develop their roles. There were also some unfortunate actor choices, such as for roles of Miss Woodhouse, Knightley and Churchhill. Miss Woodhouse was so cold and a bit nasty, which created the overall unpleasant atmoshphere. The undertone was so mean that it took the comedy part out. Mr Knightley was so mellow, so overcooked macaroni that one hardly noticed he was there. He was missing that stingy sharpness. Frank Churchill stands around and all the flirting and energy is no where to be seen.One cannot help comparing to the 2009 four episode adaptation of Emma. It is so superb version! Romola Garai absolutely nails as Emma, she is so happy, energetic and in a right way funny and vain. And every actor even in a smallest roles are so perfect.Bill Nighy did his usual vague situation comedy act as a Mr Woodhouse. It worked like a clock of course, but then again those scenes were from a different movie. Miranda Hart was decently loud as a Miss Bates. Only sunshine was actor for Miss Smith, new face, and a really fresh take. There was a interesting side roles from some Sex Education actors.Some mandatory nudity was added and a couple of roles in scenes are reverted. As such these scenes were fine, alone, but they just don't fit well to overall story.
The duet of Miss Fairfax and Mr Knightley diminished Mr Churchhill's role to periphery and took out his change to wickedness and why he rattled this little community so. Mr Knighley running after Emma's wagon was probably meant as a romantic gesture, but who does such things? Even in a great emotion, run miles in a moments of anxiety and especially in a time when social norms were very restricting? And somehow Miss Smith ventures to a forest just after a ball?If you want to see Emma, dont' waist your time for this. Watch the 2009 Emma. It is four episodes (a lot of time during the covid2019!), and Jonny Lee Miller (US Sherlock!) as Mr Knightley.",Emma.
221,denyanviegas,"It's like watching The Kardashiand, but actually good",9,6 April 2020,"This movie it's about a lot of Rickh Families living with each other and having romantic interests with each other, it's a recipe for a bad and mossy movie, but, for me, it's pretty good and emotional. The way that the social relantionships are explained and interconnected it's great and you really fell all the things that each character pass and fell, the really great acting helps to achieve this. Also, the evolve of the main character it's very relatable, at least to me. It's a great movie that uses a silly premise to tell a great story, loved it.",Emma.
222,finncoglini,Completely Brilliant,10,30 January 2021,"I couldn't for the world, even begin to understand the bad reviews for this. I am completely in love with this movie. There is not a dull moment to be found, the music is wonderful, and the acting and actors are simply brilliant, each one of them. I've very much liked the numerous previous versions of it but this one was indeed the best of all of them by a vast amount. 10/10 watch it. Trust me, you shan't regret it.",Emma.
223,annieonu,Beautiful movie,10,15 April 2020,Had me laughing and I also smiled till my cheeks hurt.. although I had to watch it twice to understand the old English dialogue...have since watched it more than that because I truly love this movie and the actors did an amazing job as it perfectly to me ..not seen any of the other movies from the franchise and not read the book but this was an interesting take of two nobles falling in love and so id highly recommend this movie as I give it a ten star!,Emma.
224,arireal,A Satisfying Adaptation,8,15 May 2021,"Adapted from the Jane Austen novel ""Emma"", this motion picture illustrates the plot in a "" WELL MAINTAINED "" Posh-comedy-historical way.

226,rsna_mille,Why are there good reviews of this disturbing movie!,1,6 January 2021,"Weird music, jumbled storyline, naked knightly, and Emma gets a nosebleed! I wouldn't have minded if they strayed from the book, I wouldn't have minded the extra humor and added color, I did however draw the line at the nosebleed! Ridiculous story telling!",Emma.
227,syntax73-850-855317,Don't listen to the haters,10,29 July 2020,"Gwyneth Paltrow was the absolute worst at this role, like many she has undertaken. Finally we have an Emma we can be proud of. A beautifully shot film, and acting superb executed. Ill watch it again and again.",Emma.
228,girsoul,They tried,5,23 February 2021,"The costumes and locations are beautiful. The acting is dull. The actor's expressions are ok, but the delivery of their lines leaves a lot to be desired. If I had never seen the Gweneyh Paltrow version, I wouldn't have anything to compare it to. I much prefer that version.",Emma.
229,Meeren,I must go and rewatch the 2009 Garai/Miller version at once,4,13 April 2020,"..in order to erase this 2020 mess from my head. Mr Knightly was constantly the underdog to Emma in this new version, and not the other way around as it should've been. His ""Badly done!"" fells flat as he has to deliver the line to Emma being positioned higher than him, in a wagon. And the nosebleed, really! And the ridicolous shirt collars.The film could be a musical - omit the lines and just keep music and there you have it. The music was fine but there was too much of it.I give some stars due to the some fine characters portraying e.g. Jane Fairfax - a quite likeable Jane in this version! And, although at first very strange to see Yara of the Iron Islands in a Jane Austen, her Mrs Weston very soon fits nicely into place.",Emma.
230,misungpark,Beautiful but weird,5,2 December 2020,"An eye-candy for its gorgeous costumes and sets, but the way the story is told is not very smooth and if you haven't read the book by Austen, I am sure you will feel quite lost. And what's going on with the acting? All the characters act so weird, in a rigid pompous way that I couldn't help but wondering if this was intentional or not.",Emma.
231,meadhbhcollins,"Beautiful, quirky but something is not right",7,7 July 2020,"After watching this I was not sure if liked it or not. This is beautifully made film. Costumes, sets and everything is spectacular. It's a quirky take on the story, much more opulent that other versions, and also a little more risque and fun. If you know and love the book and older versions, you might find this representation a little jarring. The version of Miss Bates, as not seemingly very poor at all, the father as much more energetic, less lovable, draft loather and the general conceited nature of most characters. What is also lovely in this version is the time given for Harriet's character to have a full exploration of her story. Why not have a different take on the story, I like all the previous versions in different ways, I will give it another go, it might become a favourite. I would like more of these films made.",Emma.
232,nyfreelanceeditor,roll over jane austen,1,10 January 2021,"Austen was a master at skewering arrogant fools, especially wealthy arrogant fools.They were her neighbors, after all. The first two film versions of her novel, Emma, captured the subtleties and language of her characters. This film relied on broad almost slapstick comedy - so much so that the reader, audience had no way of connecting to or caring about any of them. Add to that treason the huge departures from the original story lines and the waste of great acting talents in cameo roles such as Bill Nighy, and you have a total travesty. There were already two creditable versions available. Why produce this piece of junk at all.",Emma.
233,rlindsay-88363,Good napping material,3,23 February 2020,"Slow, ponderous, devoid of any humour. It interrupted a nice nap I was having half way through. Seriously, it appears whoever has done this adaptation has missed all of the humour and nuance of the original book. The acting is good, the lead is actually really quite good as Emma. However it's just missing anything to drive it along.",Emma.
234,bluenotejazz-64946,Take my review with a grain of salt,4,6 March 2020,"Please take my review with a grain of salt. Period pieces/costume dramas are not really my thing. But I liked Gerwig's take on ""Little Women."" And the trailer for ""Emma."" had the energy of ""The Favourite.""If you're at all like me, and you are interested in this film because of that energy from the trailer, I'd like to tell you that you will he disappointed. This does not have any edge, nor much snark.There is nothing ""bad"" about this film at all. Maybe some of the editing and camera placement is odd, but I'm not subtracting points for that.But, what's the hook?I found nothing particularly special about this film. Sure, the costumes are nice, the music is sweet, and Taylor-Joy is solid. But there was nothing compelling. The saddest thing I could say here was:I felt nothing.I didn't laugh once. I was never shocked. I never got choked up. I didn't feel a single strong emotion for this whole film (not even a negative one like boredom or hatred).So I suppose that I find this film to be very forgettable. See it for yourself and ask yourself what's special about it. What will you remember a year from now?It's another English film with pomp and frills and everyone is romantically interested in one another. It would be easy to confuse this with so many other films.",Emma.
235,debbie-willoughby,An absolute delight,10,16 February 2020,"Just been to see Emma with my son and daughter and what a delight it was!
Perfectly cast!! Anya is a wonderful Emma, and I think they scoured England for the handsomest man they could find in Johnny Flynn as Mr Knightly
Bill Nighey and Miranda Hart added great character acting and humour.
Beautiful set in some stunning country homes The music really added to the polish of the movie it was like a character of its own
Emma followed the book faithfully and was perfectly paced, and the humour was played to the max it was so fun to watch. Spoiler: Mr Woodhouse and his 3 screens was a laugh out loud moment and there were many others!
Give yourself a treat and see this movie!!!!
I plan to go again",Emma.
236,veewatson,The least of the Emmas,6,12 December 2020,"I was disappointed at this attempt. The acting across the board seemed one dimensional and the pacing also flat, both hurried and tedious. I chalk this up to direction. I don't understand some of the choices they made with the storyline and tone. It's trying to be too modern and sardonic. The only thing about the film worth the book is the beautiful interiors and costumes. Anna Joy is lovely and I liked her onscreen but I don't like the way she was used. Unfortunately I can't help compare to the source material and to other versions which are superior.",Emma.
237,pennyblack-26915,Playful smart and absolutely ravishing.,10,10 March 2020,"I am jealous of the next generation of students who will get to watch this in class. Faithfully takes the exact text of the book and breathes the humanity and passion whirling beneath the dazzling facade of the elite society that Autumn de Wilde and her talented cohort deliciously portray with mischief and delight.Every rewatch reveals a new layer.I can't help but be saddened by the decades of films we have missed out on through Autumn not being given the opportunity to direct earlier in her career, like Michel Gondry, with whom she shares that joint talent of visual flair with ability to coax amazing performances but I look forward to everything she does going forward.",Emma.
238,sinapisme,A Sheer Delight,10,15 February 2020,"I have a keen historical interest in the Regency period and I could find no fault in this spectacular recreation of the time and place. The photography drew me intimately into the action, the costumes male and female were gorgeous, the hats outrageous and straight out of Gillray and Rowlandson cartoons. Despite knowing the book and numerous screen depictions, I am sure I have never before laughed so openly or so frequently, at the sublime visual reactions of all cast members to telling points in the dialogue. As an example, Emma's face when Jane starts to play is an absolute picture. I sat through this very familiar tale with bated breath in anticipation of this ingenious and refreshing treatment of the development of the action. It would be unfair to single out individuals - a superb team effort.",Emma.
239,sgtmikey13,Absolutely Incredible,10,5 November 2020,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Perfectly cast. Incredible screenplay. Costumes perfect. Directing right on. Humor well placed. Beautiful scenery. etc. etc etc. Wow.,Emma.
240,micule-ieva,Amazed!,8,9 May 2020,"I had really been surprised. This film includes modern notion of the old classic. Even mor actor Johnny Flynn is not only an excellent actor, but also author and singer of some of these wonderful songs! Kudos! All those who say it's slow or dull. We live in such fast world that we forget that there were times when letters came after weeks. To see your relatives took almost never when one married just some miles away... Enjoy the slow!",Emma.
241,KGJR_,Emma à la Wes Anderson,7,26 March 2020,"This adaptation of Jane Austen's classic is what I imagine a Wes Anderson adaptation of the novel would be. The colour palette, symmetrical shots, profile shots, and the relatively deadpan delivery by some of the characters all reminded of Anderson.Music was so present throughout the film that the soundtrack was like a narrator.Miranda Hart was an incredible Miss Bates. Overall, I loved the cast. Bill Nighy as Mr. Woodhouse also felt spot on. I was excited to see Tanya Reynolds as Mrs. Elton and Connor Swindells as Mr. Martin since I love both of them from Sex Education. Likewise, Rupert Graves was a wonderful Mr. Weston. I don't think I have seen her in anything else before, but Mia Goth was a great Harriet Smith; she was what I imagined the character to be while I was reading the novel.I thought Autumn de Wilde's Emma. was an admirable adaptation. I definitely preferred it to the 1996 version.",Emma.
242,mojo-72784,Simply a delight,10,12 March 2020,Bill Nighy was perfection. I dismissed the music score before leaving the theatre. Emma is at once frustratingly aristocratic and also naive. This adaptation captures so well Austen's ability to parody class differences primarily in attitudes in a way that isa both moving and hilarious. I enjoyed every moment as I trust you will also!,Emma.
243,chengyiting-56338,Satisfactory movie,7,2 April 2020,"I like Austin so I gave four stars, and the movie itself may only give me three stars. The role is good, can reflect the character of the character, but it is a bit too hard, is the expression of the heroine a bit stiff, her friend Harriet should be simple rather than an idiot. But the English manor had a good view and was pleasing to the eye.",Emma.

246,arabella_wiccan_childe,Why?,5,29 October 2020,"I would love for this movie to have served past the Gwyneth paltrow version. Sadly it feels like nobody told Taylor that she was in a comedy. The music says she's in a comedy the costumes say she's in a comedy. A lot of the dialogue says that she's in a comedy. Bill nighy certainly knows that he's in a comedy. but I think that Emma should be a little bit more understood and likable, even if she is an outrageous snob through most of the story. I just felt nothing but coldness from the beginning of this movie.I'm not saying it's bad but I am befuddled.",Emma.

248,karyne-richard,A movie of visual beauty,8,22 May 2020,"This version of Emma is just beautiful to watch! The photography, sets and costumes are of extreme beauty and the score also amazing! Actors are fantastic altho i didn't like that type of Emma which is very different from other versions such as the one with Gwyneth Paltrow. I thought this Emma was too vain and artificial and not very likeable really! i did not care for that actress altogether that much either. Otherwise, still a magic and very entertaining movie, the director did a very impressive work of her first movie!!!",Emma.
249,thrillerrayne,Fun but forgettable.,5,22 March 2020,"I'm not a big fan of the novels by Jane Austin. But, i do enjoy the movies adapted. ""Emma"" is a quirky, fun little period piece about a 21 year old stuck up match maker that loves to interfere in other people's lives to make sure she's in control of her social status. Without anyone actually succeeding in out staging her in anyway. The movie seems simple. Though, it twists and turns. And has alot more to say. Which i believe could've mostly been trimmed down. This could've worked as a tv show. Or a much shorter film. This was an hour long story that was stretched to 2 hours. By the hour and twenty mark. I felt really bored. Because, it didn't feel like much was accomplished. There were funny gags and interesting ideas thrown in. But, never anything that made the viewer sink their teeth into. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. And the actors did their job exceptionally. However, the script was too bland for it to be memorable.",Emma.

As the fashion was driven by the new dyes developed for textiles, it is a sign of scholarly respect to the best evidence of what was like in the first quarter of the 1800's in England.

254,loveswedishfish,Time has been kind to this Emma. version,7,8 November 2020,"I am verrry fond of the miniseries and the Gwyneth Paltrow movie, but this movie left me feeling cold out of the theater.

I felt a little more sympathetic to Ms. Woodhouse today.",Emma.
255,fameasserleeds,Period matchmaker misses the mark for me,6,14 February 2020,"Before there was Tinder, there was Emma, the matchmaking girl from Jane Austen's book played by Anya Taylor-Joy.She does go about her business fitting up her friends with eligible bachelors whilst not even thinking about her own affairs.Anything Jane Austen is going to scream period drama and charm and this film is no exception. Taylor-Joy plays the part well but in a film so far removed from my own personal tastes, it was fighting an uphill battle from a very early start.But that's not to say its a bad film. On the contrary. The only gripe I had was that the film was billed as comedy and part of me wanted much more in terms of laughs from the whole thing. It just fell short.
It's cute and beautiful, with some of the best locational shots and costumes seen on screen.Even the addition of Cineworld advert ""Why do we go to the cinema? To Escape"" guy, Johnny Flynn as George Knightley didn't actually put me off as much as I thought it should have.If you like this sort of thing, as most people in the cinema seemed to (they were all over the age of 50), then I expect it would score a solid 7/8 but I was impressed with it enough to give it a 5/6",Emma.
256,henryllama,too dreary for words,2,12 March 2020,Visually beautiful...but empty of soul....really dreadful...Emma (the lead) was particularly awful....save your time/money--see other versions..this one was torture to sit through,Emma.
257,MaryT68,Amazing first feature,10,27 August 2020,"I delayed watching this, I expected another Luvvie fest that we usually get with this title; Bill Nighy was the reason I eventually viewed it. What an excellent surprise - it's snappy, it's bright and amusing with a perfect cast and Bill Nighy stole the show with about 6 lines in total. I understand this is a first feature for the director Autumn de Wilde; hope there is more in the pipeline. The styling was stunning. Good job by all involved",Emma.

This one is beautifully done. For those that don't like any variation from the novel, read the novel!",Emma.
259,skycurb,Well done Emma,8,17 February 2020,"I read a few reviews before heading to see the movies, so I prepared myself for a flawed shallow movie. I was pleasently surprised. This version of Emma kept me engaged throughout. I found it easy to empathise with this Emma, as misguided as she was. Even her words to Miss Bates made a lot of sense to me given how often we see her trapped by social curteousy to listen to her talk on and on about Jane. Her tears felt very real and raw after Mr Knightly scolding. I loved the costumes, interiors and cast. The scene where Mr Knightly and Emma feel attraction for each other the first time was expertly done. Even though I do not particulary like the casting choice for Mr Knightly, I could see the attraction between the two. Would happily rewatch.",Emma.
260,OhoMaka,Stunningly beautiful Anya Taylor-Joy in a perfect role,9,23 August 2020,"I've never been a big fan of historical ""costume dramas"" as they tend to bore me. But to my surprise, Emma. is absolutely breathtaking. The entire cast is fantastic, but this is a perfect showcase for Anya Taylor-Joy's beauty, elegance, charisma and talent. Even though her character Emma Woodhouse is not perhaps the most likable character ever, Taylor-Joy's exquisite performance makes this movie by far the best historical drama I've ever seen. There are, surprisingly, quite a lot of funny scenes - Bill Nighy is a welcome addition to the cast. Why can't all costume dramas be as good as this one?",Emma.
261,laureesmua,Where was the comedy?!?,5,19 May 2020,"I love all things Austen, this adaptation was such a disappointment. Yes the costuming was wonderful, yes the sets and backdrop were wonderful! But EVERYTHING else fell flat. Anya Taylor-Joys Emma was bratty (I mean how many times did she roll her eyes?) The character may well be a snob but she was never intentionally rude (save the Miss Bates incident) Mia Goths Harriet cane off more melancholy than silly as she was in the book and every other adaptation. I literally could go on with each and every character portrayed in this film but suffice it to say no real Jane lover will find this adaptation up to par.",Emma.
262,cstaude-373-352722,A delightful remix of a great story,9,29 February 2020,"Went to see Emma this evening anticipating a novel spin on a beloved story. I got what I came for and then some. A remake of any well loved classic is difficult to pull off but this version was a winner. Bill Nighy was a delightful father to this new Emma- his antics made for a much more light-hearted tone in the Woodhouse home.
Also delightful to see Chummy (Miranda Hart) onscreen again in her role as Miss Bates. She played her with zest and made us like her in spite of ourselves.
In terms of costumes and settings- a gorgeous film. I could have done without the Red Capes ala Handmaid's Tale (!!?) and a certain nosebleed moment (why???) but all in all a great time in the theater. Loved the soundtrack mix. May actually track it down to purchase it!",Emma.

264,fernbrodie1111,Tries too hard to be clever and made me cringe,2,24 June 2021,"So boring to see yet another film that stresses style over substance. It tries too hard to be clever, but lacks real charm, wit and heart. Several of the actors seem to struggle with the dialogue -- I'm not sure if this was a choice by the director? I hate the high-pitched, breathy, affected accents. Such a shame, because the cast is amazing and the costumes are absolutely stunning and wonderfully accurate. It's like watching an amateur play, and I feel the a tors deserve better than this.",Emma.
265,radinovich,Needed more.. spice,6,17 November 2020,"Anya Taylor-Joy can do no wrong, she is amazing in everything and she nailed Emma as well. The rest of the cast was very fitting as well so all the characters were played out to their full potential.
The comedic angle in this film was very strange, for example the fathers ridiculous fear of drafts, but somehow the weird humor fit into the film quite well.
There isn't a single thing I can point at and say ""this sucked"" in this movie, but there also isn't anything that particulary stood out as good. There were times where things got fairly boring and nothing notable happened, so the plot seemed a bit dragged out.
It's not a fast paced type of film, and I'm fully aware of that, but the dynamic could have still been better.",Emma.

270,kaninefat,"A good movie, spoiled by the music",6,3 March 2020,"Potentially, this could have been one of the best Jane Austen movies ever. Ithas a talented cast and a good script. It is well directed, and it looks beautiful. So, what could possibly go wrong?
Simple: the score. What were they thinking? The music for this movie is terrible. To begin with, most of it is completely anachronistic. I swear I heard gospel singers; in a movie set in England 1800 AD! Second, it's the wrong type of music. Emma is a romantic comedy wrapped up in a period piece. Too bad nobody told the composer who seems to have thought he was working on an epic drama. The score blasts the audience in the face with all the subtlety of a Wagnerian opera, except that Wagner understood his medium and would never have made this mistake. To make things even worse, the timing is completely off. Dramatic music swells in the middle of the scene as though leading up to a crucial event, except nothing happens. Then there is silence, as though something momentous is about to be said, except nobobdy talks. To make this disaster complete, the background music intermingles with the music that actually occurs in the stort in a way that both confuses and irritates. A small congregation in a village church produces a quoir and orchan as though it's St Paul's cathedral; a quartet playing in a ballroom thunders like a symhony orchestra.This is such a shame. Music can greatly enhance a movie. In this case, it nearly ruins it.",Emma.
271,ralphdaily,Anya Taylor-Joy was a joy,10,21 March 2020,"My wife and I have read the book and watched the other Emma movies. We enjoyed this movie so much. Costumes were great, every scene was beautiful. We kept pausing the streaming to examine detail. I really liked Anya Taylor-Joy. I've seen her in other things but she made Emma come alive for me. Another joy was the soundtrack. Excellent. It's unfortunate the virus cancelled theater showings but it forced an early streaming release which was just the thing for us in cities with a shelter in place ordinance. Highly recommend.",Emma.

(yes, the ""dot"" is part of the title!) on AppleTV last night for the first time. So... my verdict... I liked the new version ""ok"" when we watched it last night, but now I'm watching it again a 2nd time since I've got it rented for 48 hours.
And this 2nd time, I absolutely love it! There were things I wasn't sure I liked the first time because they were so novel, but in this 2nd viewing, I see the director's absolute genius. And Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart are brilliant! Watch it and give it a second try, if like me, you were sceptical the first time!Edit: I'm watching it a 3rd time during my lunch. I'm truly loving it! I love the tongue-in-cheek perspective that the director gives us! Wasn't sure of that during the first viewing, but now I think it is exactly as Jane intended!",Emma.

276,rebecca-woods87,Almost spot on!,7,12 July 2020,"I think what I love the most about this adaptation is that it seems to feel no need to apologise for some of Emma's behaviour. Austen wanted a heroine who was not very easy to like and that is exactly what we've got here. This film, just like the book, shows the progression of the character, Emma certainly learns a lot within the year!
Unfortunately with any film adaption of a full length novel, there must be some deviation, either bits missed out or amalgamated. Despite this, the film managed to capture the spirit of the book, something that, in my opinion, no other film or tv serious has managed to do.
I enjoyed the fact that the romance is ramped up compared to the novel, but thankfully this was done without sacrificing any of the comedy.
Well worth a watch!",Emma.
277,stingluver,Will not watch again.,6,26 April 2021,"There is so much wrong with this film I don't know where to begin. Bad casting for Mr Woodhouse and it felt like he didn't know who he was supposed to be. Watching him rush around nervously and then complain about the heat was confusing.So much was missed in this adaptation which made it seem disjointed. The nose bless was ridiculous! The best part of this was Anya's performance, the rest could be left on the cutting room floor.",Emma.
278,teoyrs,"Beautiful cinematography, but that's all",5,24 January 2021,Started watching it as soon as I finished the book and was left baffled and disheartened. Did I really fail to see that absolutely ALL of the characters of the book were so annoying or were the scenario and acting taken to an extreme? It was only a pleasant watch thanks to the stunning visuals.,Emma.
279,bebromana,"Good Adaptation, Light and Frothy, Good Fun",7,9 March 2020,"I've seen numerous adaptations of this Jane Austen classic. The earliest version I'm aware of is a 1970's TV version with Doran Godwin. The 1990's were rife with Emma adaptations, ranging from a modern take on Emma in the film Clueless, the 1996 Gwyneth Paltrow version (fairly accurate to the book with a beautiful score by Rachel Portman), and a 1996 TV version with Kate Becksindale. There was a more recent TV version in 2009 with Romola Garai.How does this version stack up? It was a light-hearted, enjoyable romp, filled with great character acting performances. It was not as accurate to the book as some other versions, but it did not deviate so much as to be unforgivable.A lot of the success of any adaptation of Emma pins on how successful the actress is at portraying her. Emma is perhaps one of the most flawed of Austen's heroines, spoiled and rich, but not necessarily ill-natured. A lot of Emma's flaws come out of her youth, isolation, and inexperience. She's never really been challenged. Any actress playing her has to show the flaws while still being appealing. Anya Taylor-Joy is rather cute in the role, so is able to negotiate that tightrope of being a flawed, yet appealing character.The characters of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax are underdeveloped. I felt 1996's Ewan McGreggor did a better job in playing a charming young man who may or may not be a little less than completely honest.Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart were a riot as Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates. Miss Bates' role in the novel is quite pivotal. She has huge verbal torrents of streams of consciousness that reveal things Emma is blind to, yet this talent is not picked up upon in the movie. Many of her ramblings provide clues to secrets later to be revealed.The actors playing Harriet, the Westons, the Eltons, and the John Knightly family were all reliable in their roles.So this gets us down to Mr. Knightly. Mr. Knightly's portrayal was not was I imagined Mr. Knightly to be. Johnny Flynn reminded me just a little too much of Kristoff from Frozen. Any moment I thought he'd take off and sing a duet with Sven the Reindeer. And what were with those high collarpoints? He could barely turn his head. Mr. Knightly is a man's man, not a dandy. I was rather smitten with Jeremy Northern's Mr. Knightly from the Paltrow version, but perhaps he was a little too handsome to be Knightly. Knightly is the only person who can keep up intellectually with Emma -- Frank Churchill is close, but a little too much like her. I was looking for a little more sparkling wit. Still Johnny Flynn is a credible actor. Knightly is more observant than Emma, but has his blind spots.The audience broke out in laughter several times during the movie. All in all, an enjoyable romp. Not perfect, but good fun.",Emma.
280,peterfessier,"It was not well done, indeed! (but not badly done)",5,22 June 2020,"Emma is a swing and a miss, but I still had a nice time. I've seen a few different versions of Emma and I haven't loved any of them. I don't think it's Jane Austen's best work. However, I'd take the 1996 version with Gwynith Paltrow and the 1997 version with Kate Beckinsale over this one. I give the director credit for doing something a little different. This version is a bit quirkier than the others and has a dry humor to it. The father played by Bill Nighy did make me laugh. The movie looks great due to the costumes and the way it is filmed. However, I think the two main characters were miscast and Anya Taylor-Joy's Emma was not particularly likable. When it gets to the famous scene where she's mean to Miss Bates at the picnic is doesn't work as well because it's not out of character. She needs to be a likable person that is doing something unexpectedly mean. The scene only works if you know a good person just said something bad and embarrassed themselves. Is it dramatic or awkward when Trump says something mean? No, it's just what we expect from him. There's no drama or surprise to it. I heard a female movie critic say that Johnny Flynn was very attractive, but he didn't seem like a Mr. Knightly to me. I could see him being a really good Mad Hatter in Alice in wonderland. Normally I don't really second guess the casting, but in this case, both of those characters felt wrong to me the whole movie. I did like Mia Goth as Harriet. When she smiled, she lit up the whole screen. Gemma Whelan is great too, playing a part very different from the lesbian pirate, Yara Greyjoy, from Game of Thrones. She's really good in Gentleman Jack as well. Well done g-Emma, well done indeed.",Emma.
281,rogerjreeves,Bored out of my skull,4,30 June 2020,This is a comedy? Please. Beautiful to look at but hard to watch. A mostly terrible girl becomes a little less terrible. The end.,Emma.

Hmm.....apart from being 30 mins too long it was in my opinion very very boring. Nothing happened (except for the last few scenes) and the story seemed to be in a loop - disappointing. Sets and costumes all excellent - just let down by a dull story - sorry folks,Emma.

284,sofirebonnie,It was alright,7,16 February 2020,"I watched this movie in cinemas with my boyfriend, of course I enjoyed it much more than he did, but unfortunately we both agreed on one specific thing - the plot of the story was rather hard to understand clearly, at one moment there's an argument between two of the characters and then the next minute they act as if nothing happened and somehow one has a crush on another and the other wants to marry this other random person. Don't get me wrong, I personally love this genre of film, but I found it quite hard to follow on with. Overall a 7/10 stars, it was still a good movie.",Emma.

287,maggymaytay,Visually scrumptious (distractingly so) but emotionally shallow,3,6 April 2020,"No part of this movie moved me, and I cry at almost everything. Some parts were funny, but not nearly as funny as the director clearly thought they were. The nosebleed was disappointing as we never truly got to see Emma uncovered, vulnerable, and in love because of it. She never returns Knightley's affections in any verbal sense and it's disappointing. The dynamic between Frank Churchill and Emma is utterly confusing. She is clearly thinking of him as a potential partner for most of the movie, and yet the turning point when she no longer loves him but considers and suggests him as a suitor for Harriet is all but indiscernible. If I didn't already know the plot of Emma by heart, I would have been utterly confused by the Emma-Jane Fairfax- Knightley- Frank Churchill quadrangle situation.
It's funny that I say I wouldn't have been able to understand this plot if I wasn't already so familiar with Austen's work. Throughout the film I thought that this resembled nothing of the heart and true moral education at the forefront of Emma, and so must only be entertaining to those who do not know Austen well and approach this story for the first time. (Probably insensitive of me, but that's what I was thinking while watching the film.) Instead it was all turned into a cartoon with inexplicable amounts of cakes and bouquets and bonnets in the background of every scene. It was practically suffocating. Jane Austen is funny, of course! But I felt this was a betrayal of how very serious Emma is at many points. In previous adaptations, the scene in which Knightley reprimands Emma with the sharp ""Badly done, indeed!"" is both clearly well-deserved but also imparts to the viewer a sense of Emma's shame. We both feel indignant at Knightley for speaking to Emma in such a way, and yet know he was right to do so as the secondhand embarrassment for the viewers after seeing Emma's cruelty to Miss Bates is practically unbearable. In this version, I was too caught up by being utterly confused by the relationships everyone in the party was currently having. The plot was both sped up and slowed down for no reason. Why does Knightley run to confess his love to Emma the night after the ball she throws for Frank Churchill? It's so he can be there when Frank Churchill strides in, having rescued Harriet from Gypsies. This is all very confusing as it happens on the way home from the ball - this is when Frank decides to return scissors to Miss Bates? It doesn't make sense and all feels entirely too rushed. (This is presumably thrown in as a detail from the book which hints at the degree of familiarity between Jane and Frank.) Nothing about the visual language suggests Frank's feelings for Jane, when many other adaptations do this very well.
When Emma confesses to Knightley, ""My blindness to (Jane and Frank's attachment) led me to behave in a way that must always make me ashamed"" I was trying to work out the internal logic in my mind. The viewers are not really shown anything that should make Emma particularly ashamed other than her cruelty to Miss Bates in one particular instance, and nothing about Frank's behavior could have led her to make her cruel statement. Her attachment to Frank is never shown in such a flagrant way as to make her feel ashamed. In other, more logical adaptations, it is Frank and Emma's incessant and obvious flirting that causes Jane to make the statement that she is ""wearied in the spirits."" Which, of course she is! This is the moment when the viewers, and Emma, are finally supposed to feel some sympathy for poor Jane Fairfax, though previously Emma had only been irked by her. This gives clues to the viewer of Jane and Frank's attachment. The news that they are in love, and that Frank is SO MUCH in love with her as to overcome his aunt's wishes for him to marry a lady of fortune, comes from somewhere BEYOND nowhere in this adaptation. There is no indication from anyone of anything between Frank and Jane. In other adaptations, Knightley is adept and observes their intimacy and tries to warn Emma that he thinks all is not as it seems between them. But she ignores him and says she perfectly understands Frank, leading Knightley to believe she is in love with him. This all makes sense as to why Knightley is so concerned and hurt for Emma on hearing the revelation of Frank and Jane's engagement as to rush back from his visit to Isabella and John in London to console her. It's for the same reason that Knightley leaves to visit London in the first place. The emotional tension created by all this misunderstanding is completely lost in Autumn de Wilde's adaptation. This makes the plot feel like trodding through a set of bullet points with no motivation from one event to the next. (I found myself bored at many many times in this film due to the lack of proper emotional tension.) Yet, she maintains the same dialogue as if we were supposed to believe the characters were that emotionally tense when in fact none of it has been shown. Before I go on too long about the misplaced internal logic, let me simply add that I did not find the depiction of Isabella and John's marriage as unhappy helpful in the least. It wasn't funny, it wasn't necessary... it was just a stupid contrivance for cheap laughs. There is no sign that Isabella and John are in an unhappy marriage in Austen's narrative. Like Emma and Knightley, they have grown up together as neighbors and knew what they were getting into when they married. It is in Isabella and John's happy marriage and family life that Knightley and Emma find much common ground to discuss in the novel. Again, this is all thrown away from cheap laughs as Isabella is portrayed as a raving hypochondriac.
Anya Taylor-Joy does such a good job at portraying Emma's arrogance and vanity that I find that was the lasting picture I had of her throughout the film. Even in her most humble moment, after being charged seriously by Knightley for cruelty to Miss Bates, she just whines like a teenager and I feel. No. Sympathy. This could have maybe been helped if the awful and ridiculous nosebleed hadn't taken over the proposal scene, when Emma is supposed to reveal her true feelings, saying something like: ""I do love you. I've loved you all along, but I never knew myself. How blind I was."" (Refer to Austen's stellar novel for the real version of this confession, obviously.) instead, in this version, she is given an inconvenient nosebleed which she must defend herself from. She walks off to sort things out between Harriet and Robert Martin and I feel that no big romantic moment has occurred. I must add that the kiss scene between Knightley and Emma between the screens shielding Mr. Woodhouse was charming. Had it not occurred, I would hardly have realized that the impending marriage between Knightley and Emma was more than a business deal. I felt it a discourtesy to Bill Nighy's Mr. Woodhouse that we weren't shown the scene when Emma and Knightley actually reveal to him that they are getting married; this adaptation skips immediately to the wedding.
Knightley's performance was fine, but not what it should have been. I had no sense of Knightley's being 16 years Emma's senior, and thus speaking to her almost as an older brother for much of the story. They bickered more like siblings and it felt that his lecturing of Emma was pompous, considering on how very equal terms they seemed to be. This could have been helped by a line of dialogue mentioning their age difference, but nothing of the sort was to be found. This seems to be part of the trend in the whole adaptation of making this story more appealing to someone of the 21st century, rather than accurately portraying Austen's story of a, well, slightly paternal relationship becoming, to everyone's surprise and delight, a romantic one. This is the charm of Emma. But I guess Autumn de Wilde found it to be too gross for a modern audience. It is this adaptation's loss, I believe. But never mind. Look to the superior 1996 adaptation by Andrew Davies starring Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong for the best version of the transformation of Emma and Knightley's relationship from paternal to romantic in a way that is never icky. It's a feat. Before I move on to other performances, it's silly I know but I have to say that Knightley's inability to brush his hair almost ruined every scene he was in. Why, in the name of God, did it HAVE to look so disheveled? Why? Was it an attempt to make Knightley look young and sexy? It just seemed to treat the audience as dumb. Thrown in messy hair, and you have your love interest! Please. Do better.
Miranda Hart's Miss Bates is a highlight, too cartoonish for Austen but just cartoonish enough for Autumn de Wilde. It is much the same with Josh O'Connor's Mr Elton.
I must praise the production. It is a beautiful film clearly shot by a photographer. The costumes are almost (thinking of 2 of Emma's costumes which made me gag) perfect. Most made me comment out loud on their beauty to my mother while watching. The production and cinematography and costumes are so beautiful that I feel it overwhelms and emphasizes how much the story doesn't have good pacing (in this version, but not in the novel and in many other adaptations.) The production contributed to the whole film feeling like a ridiculous macaroon which the viewer was invited to live in for two hours, and then return to a real world afterward. This is not what Austen is. She is a moral person. She is concerned with the education of her readers. The production, in my opinion, overcame any chance of this happening. This story seems more concerned with letting us 21st century viewers know that the 18th century was different, weird, and unrelatably ridiculous. All in all, I must recommend this as a visually pleasing but emotionally shallow and logically confusing adaptation of Austen's comedic masterpiece. Who would have thought you could make Emma TOO funny?",Emma.

293,cmgb_02,It's the first time that I truly get and love Emma,8,16 August 2020,"Honestly, of all the Jane Austen stories, the one that I've always had a difficulty fully relating to - especially in film- was Emma, but this film really changed me. Previously I had seen Emma's portrayals at the start only as spoiled, affected and self-centered, so I tough of her as an obnoxious and vane person, but here I saw more nuance from the start. Sure, her story is about how short sighted and full of herself she can be, but what really makes you root for her is realizing how sincere and caring she is with the ones she loves and how much she wants the best for them, wich is ultimately what's behind the things she does -however missguided they are-, and that really comes through in this film.
I truly feel a lot of care, sensibility and joy was put into the making of this film. So, I deffinitely don't think this a movie that places stetics over quality, as others have said, just the opposite. The filmmakers decisions are well suited for the fresh, intimate and feminine vision they had for Emma's world and add to the story, from the scenery and costumes, to the music and the way it's edited and shot, not to mention the brilliant acting and script. There is a lot of subtlety and wits to this movie, and it dares to be full of Anima, wich makes for a really interesting, endearing and fun wach, so I would absolutely recommend.",Emma.

It feels badly miscast in the two main characters, especially Mr Knightley, who comes across as boorish and petulant. Where is the charm, the wit, the subtlety?
And in the name of God why the nude scene at the start! We know people had bodies in the past but if it doesn't fit, in any way, with the storyline or theme why show us Knightley's rear?

I didn't really like Anya Taylor-Joy in the role. Maybe there some have been more Social Commentary or humour.I also don't know why they keep casting the same five or so actors with britface in period roles? Josh O'Connor was miles better here than he was in Les Miserables though.It all looks very beautiful and idealised...

I've read Emma and I strongly disagree with a lot of these reviews saying that the movie is shallow. I found there was amazing chemistry between Johnny Flynn and Anya Taylor-Joy, I thought Bill Nighy was endearing as Mr. Woodhouse, and all the other actors were great too. I find a lot of Jane Austen's novels quite cold, as in I find it difficult to sense any emotions from her characters because she writes so matter of factly. So I really enjoy this adaption because I was actually able to see and feel emotion from the characters. Movies are time restricted, we all know they can never cover every storyline from the book, I think they covered the most important parts and it came together perfectly.",Emma.

307,newcastlekitty,Miranda Hart steals the show,9,19 September 2021,"Another adaptation of the Jane Austen novel ""Emma"" in perfect period costume. The film itself is pleasant enough and matches reasonably well to the original novel minus an odd nose bleed. The cast works well together however it's Miranda Hart's portrayal of Miss Bates that will steal your heart. The Box Hill picnic scene where Emma embarrasses Miss Bates in front of the party had me moved to tears for poor Miss Bates and her graciousness at accepting Emma's attempt at apology was also incredibly moving.Overall another lovely period piece alone however Hart kicks it up a notch with her incredible performance. Love it.",Emma.

The scenes, the costumes, it was all just wonderful to watch. However, that is about where it ends. The music was weird, and jarring at points. I'm listening to a calm meadow scene, and then bam, some weird bluegrass country music starts blaring out. The tiny, sharp hair ringlets of the main characters and the freakishly tall collars on the men are very distracting. I liked the actress who played Emma, although she was a little meaner than I believe Emma is. I was not a fan of Mr. Knightley, however. It's not that he cant act, it's just...He doesn't look anything like I would picture Mr. Knightley looking. Some scenes he looks like a baby, and others, he just looks old. And not in a good way. If you want an amazing adaptation, I would recommend the mini series with Ramola Gaori.",Emma.

I didn't recognize the actress who played Emma but I enjoyed her performance. But the set design and costuming was incredible. In every scene my mom and I both found ourselves saying ""oh I love that chair!"", or ""that wallpaper is beautiful!"" And the clothes were beautiful and I loved the music. So that was the part of the movie I enjoyed the most. It was fun to watch. Plus the story and acting was really good. I also loved the first kiss between Harriett and Mr Martin. That was probably the sweetest first kiss I've ever seen in a movie. Anyway I really enjoyed the movie.",Emma.

314,thepinkpartydress,IT'S OVER THE TOP AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT!!!!!,10,29 November 2020,"I suppose I shall go back and read Emma -- watch the Gwyneth Paltrow film and the BBC miniseries to see what all the stink is about.
This is, in my opinion, a fabulous adaptation of one of Jane Austen's top novels. It is certainly stylized and it is without a doubt, a visual feast. I can't imagine how anyone can not enjoy this delicious romp through the English countryside. The humor! The costumes! The sets! Oh my!
Miss Austen was a splendid chronicler of society, and her cut of wit was certainly ahead of its time. Dare I presume that she would love seeing her characters come to life in this way?
When a director and screenwriter take on a classic, they know there will be those who fuss because it isn't 100% true to the novel. Autumn de Wilde(dir.) and Eleanor Catton did an extraordinary job of bringing out all of the fun and cleverness of a story that will be told again and again.
My hope: it brings yet another generation of viewers to the joys of Jane Austen.",Emma.
315,themilans-477-648705,Such a disappointment!,5,26 November 2020,"As a fan of Austen books and adaptations, I was so looking forward to this movie. However, we were stuck in Covid lockdown before I could get to the theatre to see it. Finally, this week, thanks to free pay tv week, I saw it on HBO. Am I glad I didn't spend the money on the full screen version, although perhaps some of the more egregious problems may have played better on the big screen vs. my mid-size tv.As many other reviewers have noted, the costuming, set design, settings, and cinematography are just flat wonderful. It is a beautiful, beautiful movie. Now, let's talk about the music: there are annoying sung musical interludes that are not only anachronistic, but also not terribly well done. i suspect someone thought they were a clever way of dividing scenes, but instead they are simply jarring.The script follows Austen fairly well in plot, but totally loses her sense of irony--and therefore loses what the story is about. The director has posited this as a comedy of manners, ruining much of the story. Totally lost is the fact that Emma was trying her best to do what she sincerely believed was best for those around her. She is earnest, thoughtful--and very often, totally wrong. The casting was not great. Johnny Flynn is just about five to ten years too young to play Mr. Kingsley--Kingsley was a young man when Emma was born, knew her all her life, and therefore felt justified in reprimanding her. Here he is cast as her contemporary. Many of the lesser players played for the laughs rather than letting the characters themselves elicit the laughter. So many disappointing actors--Miranda Bates playing to the worst elements of Miss Bates, rather than as a tragic figure common among women in the early nineteenth century; Amber Anderson phoning in her role of Jane Fairfax, a young woman in danger of becoming a person without a home as a governess; Callum Turner who doesn't seem to know what it means to be an heir in waiting, given by his father to a relative at an early age. The only exception is Bill Nighy, who by playing himself got Emma's father exactly right.To fit the time restraints of the movie screen, much had to be omitted or compressed. One person may wish that a certain scene was expanded upon or another that something was deleted. I think it's just a result of the restraints placed on the writers to fit the plot to the time available.If you want to see Austen as a comedy, you will enjoy this adaptation. I wanted something closer to Austen's original and was sorely disappointed. Amy Heckerling did it much better in Clueless, as did the BBC in their 2009 production starring Romola Garai and Johnny Lee Miller.",Emma.
316,madde-huljon,Dull,2,12 February 2021,A booring version of Jane Austins Emma. I was very dissapointed.,Emma.
317,alkmini-901-382694,"If her goal was to be unlikable and annoying, she nailed it",3,29 March 2021,"One thing is to give the audience a flawed character, another is to give them someone that annoying and detestable. If her goal was to be unappealing and unlikable in every single role, she nailed it. But I don't think that was the point. I didn't enjoy the film and the lead actress is mostly to blame. It wasn't just that Emma comes of as over-the-top snobby and spoiled, it's the mannerisms, the overacting, and what about all that blinking and rolling and batting her eyelashes in disgust?? Is the ""dead rolling eye"" back in style? It was like 90's mean girl all over again - but in costume. Silly, spoiled, overconfident, arrogant and just annoying. Not a good look then, and certainly not a good look now. But mostly, it's not what Emma is supposed to be. Emma is supposed to be naive, privileged and out of touch, but compassionate and actually relatable because she redeems herself truthfully, which is kind of the point of the book. But I'm not comparing to the book here, or the other film versions (it would be too cruel), I wanna stick to this movie alone. So, also, there is so much narrative discontinuity - for example, she treats Harriet like ""nah"" and then all of the sudden she cries ""she's my best friend""... Not credible one bit.I give it 3 stars because it's not a 1 star movie - so much work was poured in for me to be that unkind. At least 3 stars are earned for the costumes, the scenography and the rest of the actors - Johnny Flynn saves quite a bit of the film and is very believable unlike his partner Anya Taylor-Joy. He is so credible that you almost believe that anyone would fall for that brat Emma as portrayed here.I'm sorry if my comment is hurtful to some of the components of this movie, but this is what reviews are for. And, to be totally honest, I'm being kind with mine.",Emma.
318,orangekilts,You cannot compare this to other Jane Austen films,9,15 November 2020,"I went into this movie with no expectations whatsoever, I'm a huge Jane Austen book and movie fan.

Emma should not be a cruel girl or a vindictive one. The actress (who I have seen do well in many other things) totally missed the nail on the head. There was absolutely no charm to Emma...just meanness. Now don't get me wrong, Emma is NOT an angel as she is spoiled and coddled but she has charisma and charm and kindness. So disappointed. I watch absolutely every period piece and simply can't miss one! The main actress was too unlike what the character should be for me to enjoy.",Emma.

321,audreyromeo,Austen belongs to new generations,7,3 December 2020,"Comparing the versions and the actors selected for the different roles may be a fun exercise. But an appreciation of the multiple nuanced performances is another way to enjoy Austen's work, as in this most recent Emma. I found it delightful and more farcical. I've seen all the films and masterpiece/bbc series. Each has one or more standout performances. No one can top Sophie Thompson's Miss Bates. Jeremy Northam's Mr Knightly is maybe #1 but Jonny Lee Miller comes pretty close (perhaps a touch more judge-mental) and Ewan McGregor was the best Mr Churchill by far- and then Gwyneth Paltrow and Greta Scacchi- no denying that 1996 film had all the talent and it worked to well. The 2009 BBC series was great- Romala Garai portrayed the most depth to Emma, then. Jonny Lee and the Michael Gannon- all wonderful. This 2020 Emma has the younger actors who play pretty diverse roles in recent films and series- they adapted their quirky characterizations to their roles- which is of our times and fits with the farcical nature of humorist Austen-I smiled through it all. Josh O'Connor is great in everything I've seen him in, and brings another comic insanity to Mr Elton; Bill Nighy is always a treat no matter how small his part. All in all it's just another version - not necessary to take it too seriously- and hopefully there will be more adaptations- maybe people can play with time and space with Austen!s work in the way some adapt Shakespeare's plays.",Emma.

325,rjones-38816,Just Ok,6,24 December 2020,This latest remake was cute and ok but not better than the 1996 remake with Gwyneth Paltrow & Jeremy Northam. That cast was excellent and Northam as Mr. Knightley can't be compared. Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma was ok but not better than Pathrow. Not a fan of Pathrow but that role fit her perfectly. Some remakes are just not good enough.,Emma.
326,nozahic,A personal opinion.,8,27 November 2020,"The acting and casting is excellent. At times, Jane Austen's unusual heroin Emma is difficult to like which makes her interesting. She is blissfully unaware of her flaws as she seeks to control the fates of those around her. I have read the book a few times as Austen is my favourite novelist. I have not seen a better Emma characterisation. Anya becomes the perfect Emma; she is one of the most talented and captivating actresses I've seen in many years. Johnny Flynn's, Mr Knightly was equally impressive. I thought he looked too young to play the part at first but calculated that he was exactly the same age as his character. The sycophant, Mr Elton (Josh O'Connor) captured superbly and not over played at all. It is clear in the novel Jane Austen intended him to be quite dislikable.Emma is a visual feast for certain; perhaps so much it detracts from the plot . However, it is superbly done. Loved the natural faces and lack of make-up.The film lets itself down in one key way in my opinion. The lack of context and background to Emma's situation must have made it very difficult for people that were new to the story to get a handle on. Austen went at length to stress how important Knightly was to the community- highly regarded and respected. Emma's losing Mrs Weston to Mr Weston was a huge issue to her. I didn't feel this came across as much as it should. Overall- the beginning of the movie could have been so much better.However, I hate romantic films normally but thoroughly enjoyed it and cried at the end. Well done all involved.",Emma.
327,amzn-12500,Suitable for streaming but not the cinema experience.,4,23 February 2020,"I saw Emma on valentine's day with my girlfriend, mother, sister and sister's boyfriend. The film, while briefly enjoyable in some areas of comedy, is a complete bore that nobody should be forced to watch in the theater.This film fails to entertain even the most avid romance fans such as my sister and girlfriend who both fell asleep during the viewing. This is in no way a terrible film, but I truly believe it should have been directly released on a streaming service and does not deserve a theater run.",Emma.
328,branthadaway,A Badly Directed Train Wreck,2,14 November 2020,"I decided to watch this after falling in love with Anya Taylor-Joy's performance in The Queen's Gambit. Taylor-Joy in the lead role struck me as a can't-miss, Emma had received glowing reviews, and I've been a fan of other Jane Austen adaptations in the past.However, it became obvious within the first ten minutes of Emma that the director, Autumn de Wilde, had no clue about the language of narrative filmmaking. Shot choices and sequences seem random, the camera often jumping around in a scene so much that the viewer becomes disoriented. Characters appear out of nowhere, yet you are expected to instantly understand their relationships to other characters. One can almost see the performers' growing sense of dread as they realize that they are not in good hands.In short, Emma looked like it was directed by a film student, not a skilled feature director.I have since read that de Wilde comes from a music video and graphic arts background, which explains a lot. Directors who come from this sort of background tend to struggle with narrative filmmaking, and they are often just plain awful at it.Some directors from this type of background, like Michael Bay, manage to cheat their way through by creating images that are at least visually arresting, even though their skills at shot sequence, composition, and editing remain horrible. De Wilde attempted something like this, but it falls flat. In an interview, she said that she wanted to add visual humor to the story. But visual comedy is hard to pull off, and in the wrong hands it can be terrible. De Wilde's effort was typical of the latter. Having the actors make silly movements and gestures in front of a wide-angle lens might ""look"" funny, but when unconnected to a visual narrative it's just annoying. The cast of Emma looked so ridiculous that I began to feel embarrassed for them.(By contrast, the director of The Queen's Gambit, Scott Frank, spent decades as a screenwriter, working with skilled visual storytellers such as Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight), Barry Sonnenfeld (Get Shorty), and Steven Spielberg (Minority Report). His understanding of the craft shows in every detail of The Queen's Gambit, which rarely strikes any sort of false note.)Will de Wilde take the lesson? I doubt it. Obviously, a memo went out to the press, so the reviews are glowing and the interviews fawning. De Wilde will probably make the mistake of believing that she's arrived. She hasn't, and I suspect that the execs who backed this dumpster fire know the truth.I nevertheless give the film two stars because I could watch Anya Taylor-Joy read a newspaper for two hours. Her beauty is other-worldly.",Emma.

The actors amd outfits were great, the whit throughout was very comical and enjoyable and mostly it stayed true to the novel. The reasons i have marked it down are some of the added scenes and changes to the original story. I disliked the knightly Emma scene when he comes clean and she has a nose bleed and i also felt the Jane and Mr Churchill story wasnt as clear and maybe confusing for someone without prior Emma knowledge. Overall though another good adaptation of a great book.",Emma.

Yes it's the same old Jane Austin stuff but imo it is period drama done right, unlike what I thought was a hideous version of Little Woman that was over hyped before Xmas. A little slow in places if you have to be critical but stick with it and I doubt it will dissapoint many but the most miserable movie goer.",Emma.
332,abland-66103,A delight,8,1 March 2020,"I loved almost everything about this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Visually it is a delight. The use of mature trees in parkland is spectacular. I did wonder why everyone's property had been given an upgrade - Donwell Abbey is surely not Pemberley and Miss Bates' poky apartment could not really have had old tapestries on the wall - but these do not detract from the viewer's pleasure.When I saw it, a woman walked out as soon as she saw Jonny Flynn as Mr Knightley - she was making a big mistake. He looked like a much more credible marriage partner for Emma than some of the older men we have seen in the part. It was an intelligent and sensitive reading: a revelation to have his emotion and frustration so clearly presented.Anya Taylor-Joy looked wonderful. Her facial expressions were finely tuned and mesmerising to watch, particularly as she began to be jealous of possible rivals for Mr Knightley's regard.The costumes and the jewellery were a visual delight: so many lovely outfits. Pacy, upbeat music and constantly changing scenes all sustained the interest.I'm amazed that anyone could have been bored by this production: It is just so funny, apart from anything else I wanted to watch it again as soon as it had finished.

I like the film with Gwyneth Paltrow, and absolutely love the BBC miniseries, so I was cautious watching this, especially with the several bad reviews. I don't know if it was because I went in with low expectations, but I was delighted by this movie! Admittedly if you don't know the story, it can move fast, but to be fair, the book is long and tedious, with a lot to fit in two hours, which is one of my problems with the 2008 movie. The visuals and fashions of this movie are beautiful, and Emma's character did show improvement unlike some of the comments I saw. This one definitely captured Jane Austen's humor, and you can be guaranteed to laugh a few times. The BBC mini-series is still my top rated, but the 2020 ""Emma."" is, in my opinion, a notch above the 2008 ""Emma"", but would definitely recommend all adaptations, especially the book.",Emma.

339,Emii_G,Emma is perfection,10,26 September 2020,"This movie is everything I was looking for. While maintaining an interesting and somewhat risqué take on the Jane Austen novel ""Emma"", the film also manages to carry out well written dialogue and the clear character development of Emma. The movie wasn't necessarily throwing jokes around, on the contrary, all of the comedic effect was down to the timing of certain shots and lines and the contradiction of having to stick to a strict form when it comes to this era, almost showing how people in this time were just as human as us, and that is enlightening and hilarious.Although most regency era films stick to warm, earthy, neutral tones (which is valid and perfectly fine) this version of Emma decides to take on the more fashion forward and vibrantly coloured side of this era while still embracing the nature of the land, and succeeded (you see this with flowers in the hair, when appropriate, on the dresses, on the wallpaper etc. and still embracing white as one of the main colours in clothing). As well as the actors giving highly convincing, heartfelt and comedic performances, the costume design is extremely talented and manages to also pull the story together with the portrayal of certain characters' hierarchy. In order for historically creative costumes to work in films and still feel accurate, they need to have the correct silhouette of the time, this way the designer can experiment with the design and director's eye while still maintaining structure.In this film's case they manage to do all of this (including using the correct and complicated layerings and stays) and were inspired by actual past clothing designs to base some of their costume's off, while also including their own intricate textures, grounding the movie and making it more fitting for the time. Accessories were a big part of the time, especially if you were rich, and it is the little details of the hats, or gloves, or hair and even fans which tie this movie together.While Emma is obviously with the times, when it comes to her clothes (we even see her changing clothes throughout the day), her friend Miss Anne Taylor, isn't as fashion forward as Emma, at the beginning. However, as the movie progresses and we see her spending more time with Emma, we see her style mature and become somewhat more high-end. While most of these movies are afraid to embrace the lovely front curls in fear of it making the actors ""less attractive"", Emma shines as it refuses to hold back. This leads me to one of the most fascinating performances in the film, from Tanya Reynolds portraying Mrs. Elton. Considering this character travels around Europe, the designers made sure to make her outfits stand out in an exaggerated and comedic, yet stylish way. Her character sticks out more due to her different clothing, which what the other characters might view as odd at times or too much, establishes her character more. This is done especially, through the use of the Apollo knot, because although this was used mainly in the mid 1820s, it was carefully used in order to show how influenced by the latest European fashion she is, and to reflect how ridiculous her character is when contrasted to the other more traditional characters. I highly recommend this film (I have seen it 6 times already).",Emma.
340,virginiadalhousie,A farce with a dressed duck in the role of Emma,1,4 January 2021,"With this so called film you must choose between a disrespectful loud and louder laugh (helping Jane Austen to spin faster in her grave), or to do a mighty effort to watch it until the end.
The only explanation is that is a farce, plain and simple.
Full of scenario and useless scenes but empty of good acting and script, also the music is deeply forgettable. Maybe it could have been slightly saved without sonoro but this Emma is a dispenser of silly facial expressions and is ugly beyond relief.

It's so rare nowadays to see period dramas stick to the period they're portraying with out trying to modernise it to make it appeal more to the modern audience, and I really need to applaud Emma for that, if it doesn't get an Oscar in costume design this year I'll genuinely be tremendously disappointed.Other than that the movie was quite good on itself as well, I loved how they kept the more witty spirit of Jane Austen's novel, which is so often lost in adaptation in favour of a more polished, romantic result.",Emma.

350,Yasujiro60,Just awful,1,25 October 2020,"This travesty has all the subtlety of a music video. No surprise that the director made her mark in the music video world. The characters move as though they are choreographed to the music. The photography is terrible; everything is brightly lit and shot in symmetrical composition. There is no nuance to the images unlike the visual splendor of Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility or the 1996 version of Emma. It's all done in the ""Look at me, I'm so clever"" school of film making that so many young directors today belong too. I like Jane Austin a lot; this drivel isn't even worthy of Jane Doe.",Emma.
351,david-green-373-251275,Learning more about Emma,9,28 February 2020,"Over the years, I've seen several film adaptations of Emma, my second favourite Austen novel (after Persuasion). Every version brings out different, and revealing, aspects of the story. This new adaptation achieved the same effect. The sets, colour and costumes were all superb. One achievement of this version was to bring the comedy in the story to the fore. For instance, it firmly placed Mr Elton alongside Mr Collins as one of Austen's ""silly vicars"". One or two casting choices did not quite gel with my preconceptions, but even there, it was interesting to see those characters presented in a different light. There were also parts of the story that I'd never seen highlighted before, such as the platoon of girls from Harriet's school, Mr Martin's sisters, the formality of everyday life in the Woodhouse mansion. Ultimately, the film tells the story in satisfactory fashion. I was able to tick off each scene, the appearance of the main characters, and even famous lines, in correct sequence. and without undue distortion.",Emma.
352,octhrice,Best Emma,10,29 October 2020,"Full disclosure, I haven't read the book but I've seen all the adaptations and this one is my favorite. The motivations are clearer, the characters are drawn better. Check it out.",Emma.

I did not get this from this re-make, sadly. I found Mr. Knightly almost boring, and I didn't buy that he and Emma were destined to be together. There wasn't much chemistry between these lead actors although there were some funny parts, which I did appreciate. But overall, the heart of the story was lost to this modernizing attempt. Sometimes sticking with convention works! Give us characters we can care about and cheer for!",Emma.
354,karen-ramey1122,"Beautiful costumes and scenery, but...",6,8 March 2020,"The costumes and scenery of this film are lush and rich, and the cinematography is fantastic, but there was something about this film that made its pacing plodding when compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow/Jeremy Northam version. That is not to say that the 2020 version is not enjoyable, but the humor And wit of the 1996 version is lacking. Bill Nighy's portrayal of Mr. Woodhouse is oddly soulless. Anya Taylor-Joy is lovely, with deep dark eyes that seem to feel every tear, but none of the wit and twinkle of Ms. Paltrow. Jane Austen lit purists May favor this one, but t rank it below the 1996 film. See it for yourself anyway. It's still a gorgeous movie.",Emma.

Honestly, it's really bad. It looks beautiful, but the weird nudity parts do not fit into the atmosphere of the film (and Austen books/films in general) at all. The actors completely miss the defining characteristics of the characters and seem to be making a parody of the book.

Emma should be likeable/vulnerable. Anya's protrayal was not. The emotional arc and distance written in the novel for this beloved title character was not covered.
Because the portrayal was so negatively overdone, supporting characters had no chance for nuance resorting then to broad inhuman characterizations.
Gorgeous but overproduced historically inaccurate aesthetics.
Despite the heavy handed direction, outstanding performances were created by Bill Nighy and Johnny Flynn.",Emma.

Very poor actor selection. Just compare THE Mr Knightley in the book with this foolish guy!

To take the brilliance of Jane Austen's words and her story telling and mess with it the way this film did is just unacceptable to me.

Anya Taylor-Joy was not an Emma and was unwatchable. Bill Nighy was Bill Nighy (snort, twitch head, twitch shoulder, sideways look), Miranda Hart was Miranda Hart (manic laugh, silly voice, sillier walk). This is not a comedy. There wasn't a single funny moment, witness the well attended cinema with an apparently broad demographic barely raising a smile throughout. (It was more interesting watching them than the film).

380,FlicksFlix,Exactly as it should be,8,14 February 2020,"First of all, let me start by saying that I enjoy pretty much every Austen adaptation - this was no exception.
Second of all, let's draw the comparison between a movie and cake. I came into this movie knowing full well what type of cake I both wanted and expected it to be and was not disappointed.Story: The same story we know and love - no unexpected twists or new storytelling methods (like the timeline changeup of the new Little Women). I wanted a delightful butter cake and that's exactly what I got - no wild new flavour combinations. It's a delightlfully fun, occasionally ridiculous, romp. I did enjoy the little extra Mr Nightly affection we get to see in the version - makes the romance feel a little less sudden.Visual: If it were a cake, 'Emma' would be the most repinned, insta-worthy new buttercream cake on the block. Every single scene was shot absolutely beautifully and with so much attention to detail. The soft colours and pretty scenery make every shot look like what we all wish our wedding photos came out like. They play up a bit more of the Woodhouse/Knightly wealth and there is some sumptuous decore to enjoy.Acting: I'm a Miranda Hart fan and I'm glad to say she did not disappoint. She brought the perfect mix of 'ridiculous' and 'sweet/pitiable' to Miss Bates. The rest of the cast did a very solid job and of course Bill Nighy is always a great addition to any ensemble. If the cast is the structural integrity of the cake, this cake isn't going to flop.All in all, I'd say it's exactly as it should be.",Emma.
381,dianadt-72532,Beautiful sets and cinematography- that's it,2,27 March 2020,"The only memorable elements in this film
Are the sets, the cinematography, and the recurring
Images of Ms Goddards school girls.
The rest is like watching paint dry. It moves way too slow. It's uneven. Is it comic ? It's more straight with
Comic accents in all the wrong places. That is the impression it left me with. Yes, I felt the Novel prose was overwhelmingly misunderstood , given this screenplay. For this to really work you must like Emma and Mr. Knightley. I didn't I didn't care about either.
Total waste of Bill Night's talent as well. ( I hope he got paid well) It's ultimately a forgettable version.
The 1996 film still does the better job of hitting all the bullet points while keeping even pacing and consistent blending of spirit of the novel with playful creative liberties. I think this 2020 adaption will bore those not familiar with Jane Austen's works , and divide those that are familiar.",Emma.
382,jonathanmacleay,A bad parody of a romantic classic,2,17 February 2020,"Not really sure why we need another film adaption of this novel when they're already a few better versions out there. The acting was awkward and stiff, it felt like a play where the actors were still getting used to their lines or acting as if they were performing in a Pantomine.It does look stunning but like many beautiful things in life lacked any substance, character or depth.

Had a little snooze (May have snored but the whole room was asleep so no harm done) and woke up to a 40 second scene of someone walking down a corridor. Woke up again at the end and had to cleanse my eyes from what I had witnessed (which to be fair wasn't a lot as only saw 40 mins worth then decided my sleep debt was more worthy of focus).

Jane was making a parody of the upper and middle classes ... but this version slams people over the head with the delivery and over dramatised characterisation of the characters, there is no humanity or redeemable features in any of them ... just comical and inane pauses, over dramatisation .... If you come out of a movie vainly trying to find its redeemable features like Miranda Hart's version of Miss Bates or Connor Swindells Mr Martin, I am struggling to find any improvement of past versions of this novel.

One of the things I loved about 'Emma' was how to me, it felt like a modern take on a classic era. this movie showed Emma's depth and her worth as a human. the character Emma, was portrayed as an incredibly likeable woman, much more than the book and Anya Taylor Joy played her astronomically well! We got to see Emma be confident, keep her morals and make mistakes. I loved her as a character and I loved the story.

392,nsu_grl,Almost walked out! Wait for it to come out on DVD.,2,11 March 2020,"I agree entirely with a lot of the other other reviews for this movie. The decor and costume in this movie was sublime. Besides that, I blame the director entirely for how this movie turned out. Music was way off and sometimes louder then the actors and I couldn't make out what they were saying. The movie is about Emma and they tried to mix it up a bit with storyline & humor, but it fell flat. Spending to much time on character development and they lost me on the original story line.
When Gwenyth Paltrow played this part, she had a tad sense of snobbery to her character but this actress was pushing it to the limits and I ended up not liking her. She learns from her ways as the movie progresses but I simply didn't care for it. Character chemistry was bad as well. I couldn't even tell when exactly Mr. Knightly fell for her, besides after the dance. Mr. Elton's character I interpret to be ridiculous naturally but this guys was off the charts. In a nut shell, I am going home to rewatch the original. Save your money! P.S. I did love Emma's father. So I give it 1 star for decor/costume and 1 star for Emma's father.",Emma.
393,williamsbh,Modern art,9,24 March 2020,"The director, being an artist by trade, has taken this latest version of the beloved story of Emma. and made a movie that is an art piece itself.All of us who know the story already, know that emma is, well, a spoiled brat. She is arrogant, selfish and naive but good hearted as anyone would expect of a twenty year old rich young woman of Jane Austen's time. The director has taken care to make sure that the mood of the first half of this film mirrors that of the title character. All the rooms, interactions and conversation feel rather synthetic and great detail has been put into the superficial. The result is quite spectacular.As the film progresses, so too does the heroine who becomes continuously less ""unfeeling"" through very hard lessons and the criticism of course of Mr. knightly. The change is so gradual to the mood of the film that you will not notice it has happened. You will simply find yourself in love with the film around the same time that you find that Emma is a red blooded human like us all.I just want to add that no version of Emma that I have ever seen before made me believe so wholly the love between Emma and her man. The movie, by the end of it, feels incredibly real and human.",Emma.
394,fdalcanto,Joy of Gratitude,9,27 March 2020,"A thank you note to Emma (2020)Gratitude. Never has a Jane Austen story been told in such a way that discriminating readers and viewers can celebrate: charming and beautiful characters, dressed and staged exquisitely, with storytelling that is true to the affectionate nature of the author and her most beloved heroine. The film is a portrait of literary beauty with a modern charm that can be enjoyed by all.The director gifts us with an intimate portrait of our favorite characters, drawn from the parlors and pastures of Austen's England, in a way they have never been shown before: gritty and gorgeous, personalities punctuated, framed by unique artifice and edifice. This Emma is perfectly cast, lit, and dressed, down to the last button. Natural light, expensive clothes, large fires, exquisite windows, and lush greenery; every frame delights. It makes previous portrayals-though painfully more authentic in ways-seem paltry in comparison. Is it loyal to the original Austen? Well, it is an interpretation, surely, but the liberties taken with the storyline serve to make it more emotional, more fun and what may actually be more authentic to Austen's ""teachable moments.""Thankfully, there are no ugly wigs, ill-fitted-200-year-old-dresses, frumpy bonnets or bad horse-riding to distract from the loveliness. There are no cardboard sets, sloppy table designs, or boring men. There are no musical mis-steps or shortcuts taken in floral arrangements, boots, cakes or necklines. There are no shiny trousers, fake babies, or waifs to offend. Thank you. Avoiding pitfalls of so many prior tellings, easy, right? But here is the surprise, not only are the period considerations done with more thought and care, the characters are more likable than ever. The serious Mr. Knightley became more likable by casting a ""tortured rockstar"" type to play him, so there is that. Emma Woodhouse is very fine and likable in a pretty and popular Clueless kind of way. More than ever, we ""love to look at her!""The side characters are likable and compelling but somewhat compressed, newcomers to Emma will wonder at the details of the Bates Family for instance. Development of the Bates and Churchill connections was lacking. The Jane Fairfax Mysteries could be a miniseries itself? Anyone? The allure of this interpretation of Emma is not thoroughness of story or depth of characters, but a perfect balance of beauty in face and bonnet with a story that compels. Something previous Austen filmmakers have never quite managed with finesse.Even more, this telling illuminates why Emma is so enduring today. Relatable human struggles like 1) caring for elders, 2) beloved siblings living far away, 3) the lost sense of identity when displaced, and the 4) difficulty of finding equal friendships. Stating these difficulties directly in the script, was not wholly unwelcome and, indeed, true to the original. Another refreshing change is the lens placed on the central romance as Emma and George plan their own live-together-at-Hartfield ending with pleasure instead of pain. Even here, Mr. Knightley's being an ""indifferent"" lover doesn't feel indifferent. It feels different, a first.Blood, perfectly placed, thank you. A very clever treatment of the cliche of an Austen proposal scene - breaking it up with a bright red reality check. Emma urgently exits the marriage proposal to reconcile her mistakes, clearing her conscience before jumping on the proverbial satin couch with the man she and her dear friend both admire. Movie Emma seeks forgiveness with a newly learned compassion; a modern telling, but more satisfying than the sending of her lowly friend away to wait-it-out in London, a painful process to endure in the book. Notice how a simple handkerchief was written into the scene to deal with blood, passion and class-struggle, no zombies required. The handkerchief metaphor also a nod to ""Janites"" who find civility a salve for modern bloodshed.A rewarding companionship concludes every Austen story, and it is through self-reflection that Emma discovers her own feelings - in every version. For better or worse, companionship as it is understood today must reflect that the physical and emotional selves are inseparable. As a reader of Emma, integrated characters are easily drawn by applying one's imagination to the timeless situations within. The difficulty is bringing a ""whole"" Emma to the screen. One must decide for oneself if the liberties of dressing oneself, face-to-face reconciliation with Mr. Martin and embracing are welcome developments (and revolutionary writing) of Austen's themes. Some may feel the exploration of the characters' physicality on screen gives offense to the morality of Miss Austen. Then we remember how Jane's writing was sweet and edgy for its time, describing little intimacies no one had written so well before. In that pert spirit, the movie characters show glimpses into their natural states and desires, little intimacies that can be considered handsome, clever and rich, indeed.The beauty of the photography, the actors dressed and coifed to perfection, the story fun and flowing, bewitch our senses and satisfy us that we were always right: there is a proper way to tell an Austen story on screen. And this is it. It is a story of Sensual Sensibility, told with more sense and less awkward taste than any before. Emma must learn how to care about each person around her before she can close her eyes and feel herself...whatever the viewer imagines. This viewer imagines she feels grateful. The joy of gratitude is a perfect lesson for the most-lovable, Selfish Girl in literary history. And for all of us. Thank you movie-makers and Jane Austen.",Emma.
395,martinapodzubanova,Unique and fabulous,10,5 April 2020,"This adaptation of Emma looks like none of Jane Austen's work so far transformed into a movie or TV series, and yet it is one of the most fabulous things I've ever seen. Of course, if you learnt every of her novels by heart and take the romantic pathos all too seriously, I am not surprised you should hate this version. I had read the book before I watched the movie and I was happy to see that almost everything matches the original plot and the rest is even better. It is a lovely, clever and genuinely fresh comedy and if you don't cling too much to previous versions of Emma, you discover that the camera, music, beautiful locations and perfect actors have done absolutely great work. The characters like Mr Woodhouse, Ms Bates or Mrs Elton were exaggerated into the exact funny creatures I pictured them to be and they brought the exact dose of sarcasm to the story that we all needed. Once again I fell in love with Johnny Flynn, who is so much underrated it causes me pain. The friendship between Emma and Mr Knightley was very well shown and its transformation to love at the ball scene was so beautifully arranged that it makes me smile even days after watching the movie. Although the movie lacks some of the important details from the book, which had to be missed because of shortness of time, it does not make the movie any less interesting.
Long story short - if you are Austen's devoted fan through and through and you feel the need to enthuse about every time Mr Knightley dreamily looks at Emma, you'd rather not watch this version. However, if you enjoy a splendid filmmaking, which this new Emma certainly is, with all its clever wit, do not hesitate to watch it. We did not know what we missed until we were shown this marvelous and unique peace of artwork.",Emma.
396,kayteewasis,Absolutely bizarre,2,25 April 2020,"I found this movie feeling as long as its two-hour length, which with general good movies, should not be. It has such a queer, musical feel, though it is not a musical - as if the ""comedy"" in the movie all relies on the music. Much of the acting is wooden, and there are two unnecessary scenes of nudity (one only semi), which add nothing? I must agree with another comment - this is the most bizarre Emma adaptation, and one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen.",Emma.
397,rachelhetherington-47891,A pastel clad disappointment for Austen enthusiasts.,2,6 May 2020,"As a Jane Austen enthusiast, an avid reader and an obsessive film watcher, I was anxious to watch it as soon as it came out in cinemas. After watching the trailer, I was a little bit off put, with the sickly overdose of pastels coming from all directions, but the presence of the wonderful Miranda Hart amongst the cast made it seem a bit brighter. Nevertheless, I walked into the cinema excited. The glowing reviews on the sides of buses were enough to convince me it would be a great film.That is 2 hours and 12 minutes of my fleeting life I will never get back.To start with the positives, the costumes were historically accurate, which seemed to justify the film for some folks, but apart from that, it was downright unenjoyable.To start, I did not like the scene of Mr Knightley at the beginning where we all experienced the misfortune at looking upon the actors bare butt. For me, it felt very out of character for Mr Knightley, and certainly not something I would associate with an Austen novel. Perhaps it was supposed to showcase vulnerability? But surely there are more clearer ways of doing that than putting his rear on show.I found the character of Emma to be someone completely different from the book. Instead of a girl who has good intentions, but has her flaws, she is portrayed as nothing less of a sulky brat. I wasn't fond of Mr Knightley or Frank Churchill, the both seemed shallow and deprived of any liveliness, or any signs of life.The film is slow paced, and I like long films, I've happily sat through films over three hours long, but this one had me wishing it would end. Its pointless shots of scenery, and the immaculate detail of shops and homes were pretty, but I felt like I was watching the same thing over and over, and over again.I was not fond of the dialogue, it was drawn out, I assume we were supposed to take note of the characters facial expressions, but I ended up daydreaming and forgetting I was in a cinema and supposed to be watching a film.And the comedy. If you can even call it that, was something else. It seemed to be veering towards almost a slapstick, with the running ""joke"" of Mr Woodhouse's ""do you feel a breeze"" boring and unfunny. Not to mention the questionable facial expressions that were intended for our ""entertainment""???? My heart completely sunk to the floor when they decided to have Emma's nose begin to bleed throughout one of the most important scenes. Some have interpreted this as presenting her as imperfect, or a sign of vulnerability or whatever, but to me this ruined the charm and beauty of the scene.What really caused me to roll my eyes was the passionate kiss between the protagonist and Mr Knightley. What I love about Austen, and many of the adaptions (not this one) is the way that social standards are clear for us to see, and the central couple do not rely on physicality to show us their affections (as in the book it is not talked of) but we see their affections in the way they speak, the way they look at each other, they way they interact. In this adaption however, there is no chemistry between Emma and Knightley.In my opinion, it is overrated. If you want to watch an enchanting adaption of Emma with all the charm of the book, I would suggest the 2009 version.",Emma.
398,maxmovies000,"Beautiful, uplifting, and totally underrated",10,9 May 2020,"Of all the Emma adaptations I've seen, this one really stands out by its beauty. _Everything_ about this move is beautiful -- from the story itself to acting and witty dialogue (with just the right amount of comedy), from the lush English countryside (almost always shot on sunny days) to England's exquisite manors and perfect period costumes, to folk choir songs and music. The two main characters are perfect for the role, with an excellent supporting cast. The story is beautifully retold, lighthearted, and uplifting. Exactly what you need if the pandemic has got you in tears. If the movie strays too much from the source material (I've read Emma so long ago that I don't even remember if it does or not), truthfully, it doesn't matter, because the movie has got everything else going for it.IMDB ratings were so bad that I almost decided not to bother watching Emma, but decided to give it a try after reading one user review that seemed pretty balanced, and I am so glad I did. You'll enter the world of Jane Austen as it was, in all its glory, and be rewarded with a feast for the eyes and the soul.",Emma.

400,ncbooker,Fresh Twist! Quite enjoyable,9,22 May 2020,"I am a lover of all things Austen. I have seen so many different adaptations of all her books. For this one, I enjoyed all the new takes.For starters Bill Nighy's character of Mr. Wood's house is just the best thing! I love that he is just paranoid and not senile and that Isabella his daughter shares that trait.I could do without the interesting folk music. (This is the only reason it isn't getting a 10/10)I LOVE MIRANDA HART!I don't believe Jane Austen intended did Emma to be as mean as they portrayed her in this, but I kind of like it. It just makes more sense why Knightly criticizes her all the time.I absolutely love that Knightly runs to the Woodhouses after the dance! I was just so impressed and loved all the glances and the build-up of Emma and Knightlys relationship.The nose bleed scene was not expected, but that it was refreshing. It's enjoyable to watch adoption when you have no idea what will happen next.Keep an open mind and notice all the humor!",Emma.
401,wbtrf,A brilliant interpretation,10,26 May 2020,"Doing another Emma, or any new Austin film, is utterly pointless unless it brings something distinctly new to the old story. High quality mere faithfulness, treating the old as somehow sacrosanct, is pointless. This rendition brings unique comedic verve to the old story, great acting, and wonderful photography, all of it edgy, pushing the angles, and the pace, to the max. If you want ""standard fare Austin"" as most reviewers seem to, you won't get it, and won't like it. Everything here is played over the top, manga meets Austin. If you think that Austin was as edgy and irreverent as she could be and should be played to the max that way now, in order to make her fully alive now, then you might love this version, as I did.",Emma.

The two leads were neither interesting, likable or particularly attractive, and the romantic climax of the movie is ruined by a weird and unfunny nosebleed. A bumpy mess.",Emma.

If this approach had been tried by Armando Iannucci he could have carried it off but these two appear to have constructed a "" natural child"" of the Jane Austen Novel. Mr Woodhouse is too lively, Mr Knightly too sexy, and certainly not 16 years older than Emma. I keep expecting Miss Bates to launch into a naughty turn to screen.

426,mateja-grajzar,Perfect,10,26 August 2020,"I was reading some of the other comments and I must say. This version, or cast to be exact, is in my opinion perfect.
I watched BBC miniserie and 1996 version again. And i must say I like this cast the most. Emma in miniserie is just to soft and her transformation is just not it.
Even Gwyneth is i don't know somehow not the right one. Anya Taylor-Joy is a perfect Emma, high and mighty in the beginning and her transformation to soft and a woman in love is awesome.
Also Mr. Knightley. Their crosses are so vivid, their dance.. Omg, i was missing that tension in previous adaptations. You can just feel it.And also mr. Knightleys scowl after the picnic. Brilliant. Before I just found them dull, not powerful enough.And the best.. Their declaration of love. YES!!! His desperation when he still thinks she's in mourning for mr. Churchill... And hers when she thinks he's in love with either Jane or Harriet.
And then his sort of happy jump after he sees she's accepting him. Brilliant!I love Harriet's acting, mr. Woodhous's, mrs. Elton's, Jane's, ms. Bates's. Well, after watching all previous adaptations I definetly love this one the most. For me this is Jane Austen.Well yes, as it is a movie some of the parts are missing, but that is to be expected.And costumes and scenery. Emma's white and green dress for the proposal scene. I would wear that one 😍",Emma.
427,thedollarsucks,An opulent prop does not compensate bad storytelling,2,2 March 2020,"Of course, we all love the Mr. Knightleys and Mr. Darcys that Jane Austen has brought into feminine romance. Stick to the versions from the 1990's, if you want to keep some romance in your imagination intact.This new version is absolutely bad. What starts out as a maybe-funny movie, quickly turns into feeling like sitting in the audience of a cheap opera. Too much is staged (moving of figures, music). They must have put a lot of money in the scene prop and general production design. Instead of kicking the screenplay writers in the butte to come up with a more vivid plot adaption.
The main actress (what is wrong with her posture and neck?) ruins the whole film. She is just no person to identify with, trying the hardest being somewhat romantic.
Additionally, almost all scenes filmed outside are terrible in lighting or fail to communicate they season they are meant to represent. The ones filmed inside, however, are heavily overloaded and overcomposed.
One good thing: the cast (apart from the lead) was pretty well chosen. Thanks to Bill Nighy as Emmas's father, who constantly displays an air of self-irony throughout the whole film, I did not leave prior to the movie's end. And all the other antagonists were well cast, too.
Save yourself time and money and stick to your own imagination. Read the book, or grab the copy on DVD with Gwyneth Paltrow. I really hated that movie (it was a sneak preview and many people left long before the film ended).",Emma.

I was a bit disappointed in how stilted Bill Nighy's portrayal of Mr Woodhouse was. He had irreverent moments but could have been so much more.

In no other adaptation of this book does Emma Woodhouse actually appear to learn and change quite so demonstrably has she does here. There is also far more energy and believability in her relationship with Knightly. If I have one fault here is Emma gives no reason to make anyone think she would have any feelings for Churchill.,Emma.

A beautiful, spoiled girl becoming a loving and caring woman. This Emma was spoiled and rude the entire file and didn't change at all. Mr. Knightley is one of my favorite literary heroes, but this version didn't showcase any of his (or Emma's) good qualities.

448,scavengerscum,Near Perfection and a Breath of Fresh Air,9,11 April 2020,"Austenites are some of the most difficult people to please when it comes to film adaptations, so I'm not surprised to see so many negative reviews. I too went into Emma feeling skeptical, but I gotta agree with the film critics on this one. Emma is not only a near perfect adaptation, but a breath of fresh air both in current cinema and in the Austen collection.The film is beautifully constructed overall. Amazing costumes, excellent cinematography, accompanied by gorgeous and memorable music.The character treatment and acting in this story was fantastic. I found all of the performances from the actors incredibly satisfying, even the interpretations that weren't my favorite. The character of Emma is such a dominant force in the story that it's easy for secondary characters to fall short or receive underdevelopment in the script. But each character receives dimension and personality. The cast makes all these characters feels like real humans from Emma to Mr. Woodhouse to Mr. Martin to the lowly foot men in the background (who are hilarious to watch on subsequent rewatches). Johnny Flynn brings both masculinity and sensitivity to his role as Mr. Knightly. And to those complaining about his scruffiness, those sexy sideburns of his are actually very historically accurate. Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't downplay Emma's snobbery or selfishness, which I love. Austen herself didn't intend Emma to be a likeable character, and it's so refreshing to see an adaptation that did not feel compelled to tone Emma down for audiences. Rich women of this time period did not have to be likeable, and it gives Emma a bigger character arc.While this film is full of the pastel, sugary sweet aesthetics one is used to seeing in Regency pieces, this is not a movie that unduly romanticizes the time period, but gives the town of Highbury a real dose of humanity and explores complex social issues while still being incredibly funny. It's not a sentimental film despite being a romantic comedy. The tone is completely different from the 1996 or 2009 versions of Emma, with a style reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette applied to a less grim tale. Which I'm personally okay with that. I'd rather see a version that brings something new to the table than just another rendition of the films we already have.Overall, Emma is an intelligent, charming, smart film that stands out in a in a time where the most popular movies are all remakes, slapsticks, sci-fis, sequels, superhero movies. It's so refreshing to see a film that is driven by character instead of by the plot or by spectacle. Even though I think too many of the same stories are being adapted for the big screen right now, if you're going to remake a classic, this is the way to do it: with something different and fresh from its predecessors.",Emma.
449,sue-43004,Visually beautiful but the movie had no soul,5,8 July 2020,"The costumes were beautiful and the locations were very cleverly chosen but the acting left a lot to be desired and could have been much better.
The story of Emma is very light, frivolous even, apart from one or two serious moments. This was cold and disjointed and the ridiculous part where Knightley proposes compares to the version of Pride & Prejudice where Darcy jumps in the lake. I felt I could have loved these characters if they'd only been allowed to lighten up.
Jane Austen's Emma is perfectly written and when writers try to put their own mark on one of her stories, they invariably fail.",Emma.
450,sarahhall-57521,Jane Austen will be rolling in her grave,1,7 December 2020,"This is absolute trash. I love Jane Austen and have read the books and watched majority of the adaptations.

I wish I hadnt bothered, turned it off halfway through as couldn't not sit through anymore.
Emma is portrayed as an annoying, stuck up, cruel character (which is not her at all). Even Miranda Hart and Billy Night did a bad job of playing their characters.
The film skips a lot of the main story lines and jumps about way to much. Which means (unless you know the story and even if you do) the viewer has not idea whats going on.

I watched it for the first time last week, and I've watched it probably a dozen times since...liking it more with each viewing.Throughout the movie, Emma teeters on the fence between childish indulgence and true nobility, and it's satisfying to see the character develop. The love story, too, is captivating...carried along on the wings of a beautiful soundtrack.Make more movies like this.",Emma.
455,tracydenton,I have seen some films in my time but this one I hated with avengance. Boring boring. I would rather watch paint dry and that's saying something. Worst film ever. There is no,1,27 February 2020,"I have seen some filmsin my time, but this takes the biscuit. I hated this film. Boring boring boring. I would rather have watched paint dry and that's saying something. Worst film ever, no story to it at all. The op only person I liked was the lady who plays Miranda. Now she was funny",Emma.
456,jackbgonzalez,No substance,1,16 February 2020,"Absolute bore, fell asleep twice and walked out. Felt like an endless loop of waiting for something to happen. Have read the book but this was hard to get through",Emma.
457,dkp-02500,"It's a MOVIE, not a book clone!",10,27 October 2020,"""The book was better"" is the battle cry of the benighted owl critic who fails to read these four simple words: ""Based on the book."" Cinema is not meant to be literature clones. I have read EMMA twice, and it really can't be done in the same time as the movie. . Movie makers of films like ""The Tudors,"" ""Rome"" and ""Emma"" would say (and have said) their intent is AUTHENTICTY and NOT accuracy. If accuracy were the goal, it'd be like some French flicks: long, dull, lots of dialog and not much action, in B&W, and no subtitles. Authentic cinema treats the viewer to inspiring interiors, lavish landscapes as only the British can do them, and cleavage-tempting costuming. For the price of admission or Netflix contracts, the viewer expects to be entertained, not read to. So put on your rose-colored glasses, ye rigid readers, and ENJOY THE SHOW!",Emma.
458,lindseyctanner,"Boring, but beautiful costume design.",5,16 February 2020,"This film is not funny, but at least it is a unique take on the story, though it feels lifeless and flat. The costumes are beautiful, and the acting is good.",Emma.
459,welchkids,Wonderful!!,10,17 May 2021,"Every time I see this, I like it better!! This movie came out in March of 2020, right before everything was shut down because of the great pandemic. I took my daughter to the theatre in spite of warnings about ""the covid"" but we had to see it on the big screen!! Loved it! So worth the risk!We rented it as soon as it came available!! Loved it!Bought it and have enjoyed it periodically since!The costumes are so beautifully made. The sets are really glorious. The English countryside beautifully filmed and the music-The Music transports me! Anya Taylor-Joy is a perfect Emma and Mr Knightly (Johnny Flynn) is her perfect match
And yes! It gets better every time I watch it!",Emma.
460,veraarsic,I liked it,7,1 April 2020,"I anticipated this movie very much because I read the book not so long ago and I must say I liked it. The music, the costumes, and interiors are all beautiful, the acting is very good... I loved how Bill Nighy portrayed Mr. Woodhouse (even better, I think, than he was written), but what I didn't like is that Emma is not so mean in the book, just stubborn, but maybe that's just how I saw it, and I don't know why they painted her sister so unlikeable, because in the book she is described as lovely and kind but a bit paranoid girl like her father. Everything else that they changed were small but good changes. Overall I think it's beautiful movie and definitely worth watching especially for Jane Austen fans.
I'm sorry for my grammar, English is not my native language.",Emma.
461,benvoliogirl,I do not like this film,5,17 April 2020,Not as if it was a bad movie. It is just not a good one. Austen spirit is totally lost on this. Characters are acting instead of living and are inconsistent in their manner. Actors behave like stuffed dolls because of this and sometimes look like they don't want to play like that. Over-sensuality of some relationships is also distracting and unnecessary. The beauty of costumes and location is though undeniable. Good actors are waste in a beautiful but totally meaningless movie.,Emma.
462,tazkhan-78965,Not Great.,4,6 January 2021,"As someone who hasn't read the book, I thought the movie didn't quite deliver.The performances where descent but the story felt outdated and didn't resonate in anyway. Good costumes, and music.I thoroughly enjoyed movies adapted from Jane Austen in the past but couldn't truly enjoy this movie. The movie comes off as superficial and the romance feels predictable, yet, not one I cared enough to root for. The characters barely develop. No one truly learns a lesson.I would not recommend this for others to watch. If you are looking for a Jane Austen file adaptation to watch, I would suggest watching Little Women instead.",Emma.
463,morfologiadellafiaba,"For those interested in Austen sophisticated elegant poetry, better drink cicuta.",3,21 April 2020,Even the horror with G. Paltrow is infinitely more juicy. This is an unclassificable boring parody without any depth. But thank you for giving us Callum Turner's lips and cheekbones to endure the pain.,Emma.
464,sallieimdb,"Witty, sometimes hilarious, warm, and beautiful, with wonderful music. Seen it 4 times and even got husband to come once.",10,14 March 2020,"I love Austen but this film is a wonderful experience even though not a faithful adaptation. The first time I saw it was because I was intrigued by the trailer. The remaining three times were because it was so rich in delights, I needed more viewings to take them all in, especially the character development, the music, and the many subtle sight gags. I also wanted to see how many clever references to previous Austen films I could spot. For example, look closely at the set of Emma's drawings when she spreads them out on the table. I can't wait to own both the film and the sound track.",Emma.
465,anetebulmane,I loved it,10,22 March 2020,"At first i was not convinced, i found the main caracter to be - hard to like, but as movie progressed it drew me in and i ended up loving it.If you are a fan of this period of time, this movie is worth watching.",Emma.
466,ibradshaw-68566,"Before seeing this, Kate Beckinsale was my favourite Emma.",3,27 October 2020,"Before seeing this, Kate Beckinsale was my favourite Emma on film. Now that I've seen this new version of the story, Kate Beckinsale is still my favourite. Followed by Romola Garai, then Gwyneth Paltrow. This version adds nothing to the canon, and it's hard to see why it was made.",Emma.
467,xsnx-50940,A fun movie,7,22 March 2020,It was a beautiful fun movie but it was kinda boring in the beginning and then it gets better and better,Emma.
