0,Leofwine_draca,Not as good as it thinks it is,5,30 October 2020,"THE DEAD DON'T DIE is another quirky existential comedy from writer/director Jim Jarmusch, but not as strong as previous films I've seen from the director. This one's yet another zombie outbreak comedy and the good news is that it's much better than the ZOMBIELAND flicks, but it still struggles to hits its mark as a comedy. The main roles, as taken by Adam Driver and Bill Murray, are rather dry and underplayed and simply not very amusing; supporting actors like Caleb Landry Jones, Steve Buscemi and Danny Glover are much better, although you want more of them. Tilda Swinton is irritating in the way the director venerates her. The zombie material is extremely familiar and there isn't much to be said or done about endless scenes of humans battling zombies, but some of the quirky character interplay hits the mark; I was just left wanting more of that and less of the generic.",The Dead Don't Die
1,SnoopyStyle,"""Hipsters! With their irony""",7,9 September 2019,"In the tiny town of Centerville, Police Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) and Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) confront Hermit Bob (Tom Waits). Officer Mindy Morrison (Chloë Sevigny) is the other police officer. Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton) is the weird new mortician. Farmer Miller (Steve Buscemi) and Hank Thompson (Danny Glover) are two of the locals having breakfast at the diner. Zoe (Selena Gomez), Jack (Austin Butler), and Zack (Luka Sabbat) are passing through the town. Strange things are happening. The earth is off its axis blamed on polar fracking. Then zombies.Director Jim Jarmusch is trying for a meta hipster zombie comedy. It's a more dead-pan and less funny Shaun of the Dead. I'm not his biggest fan and I often rate his films a step lower than the critics. His sense of humor is a little too hip for me. This one is simply trying for fun. It's not trying to be that smart. Bill Murray is perfect for the dead-pan especially without the anger to taint it. The cast is talented and they're having fun. It really translates onto the screen. There are a few truly hilarious scenes. A sword welding Tilda Swinton is super fun when joined with the three small town cops. Sure there is a Star Wars joke but it's so awkwardly done that it's meta hilarious. This is one of the few Jarmusch film that I like much more than the general critical community. I'm just not highbrow like that.",The Dead Don't Die
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Pretty mediocre movie, neither killing you nor it",6,19 June 2019,"""The Dead Don't Die"" is an American mix between fantasy, horror and comedy from 2019, so a really recent release and the writer and director is American filmmaker Jim Jarmusch, who was roughly 65 when he made this. It runs for 105 minutes and you could say despite the pretty shocking (and sometimes also surprisingly graphic) key plot point that has zombies kill humans in a small town, it is a fairly slow film. This slowness is frequently linked closely to the comedy. There definitely is a touch of Fargo (the film, don't know about the series) to it, only that the two sheriffs here are not catching or trying to catch any criminals, but instead they are going for zombies. As for the cast, you will find many names who Jarmusch has worked with in the past on his uncountable previous projects. The two male actors at the center are Bill Murray and Adam Driver, who not too long also was the lead in Jarmusch's Paterson. Add to that Oscar nominee Chloë Sevigny and a whole lot of supporting cast members that you will recognize immediately. Feel free to check the cast list for those. The comedy in this movie is very subtle. Moments like 3 people independently asking each other if it was a wild animal that killed the two ladies at the cafe or several wild animals were already the top of show comedy. Driver has a nice little reference to his Star Wars success. But take for example the moment when Driver's character tells Murray's that he thinks zombies did it. Ghouls. A very random unfounded idea. And yet it does not get questioned from the beginning and even before there is evidence it is taken for granted. Until, as unrealistic as it actually is, reality confirms it when the undead lady from the prison cell suddenly rises. Also in this film is Tilda Swinton who channels a mix of Legolas from Lord of the Rings and the Bride from Kill Bill. Actually if the film and the writing had been any better, she could have been a real cult character, especially with the way how she exits the movie. Now that was unexpected. But random humor that comes out of completely nowhere is a key thing to this movie. But maybe she also isn't too unique anymore, for example with the references I gave.This is also a film that is very aware of itself. One early mention of the title song or I should say the ""title song"" because Driver's character knows it all, was fun and this is continued near the end when he even says something like Jim had him read the script and that's why he knows how the story continues. That's also why he is not sad when Savigny's character commits suicide in contrast to Murray's. He only knows their scenes/lines, or wait then he would know about the suicide too, right? Is he just playing to be sad and shocked. Who knows. Could it all be true? Anyway, it is still most of all a comedy I guess, even if very young audiences probably shouldn't watch. And that is pretty surprising because not only the two main characters die at the end, but also many supporting characters. Not many make it out alive. The guy in the woods who was accused early on to have stolen the chicken does. Does Buscemi's? I am not sure. Oh and pay attention to Selena Gomez. How did she end up in this movie and it was actually more than a cameo overall, even if the scene when we only see her head somewhat feels like one. Certainly her most memorable moment. Also the quotes that come from the trio of main characters following this scene. These comments actually capture the film or the comedy component of the film at its very core. It's never in your face, almost always subtle, and sometimes funny, sometimes not so much. I can somewhat see why many people did not like it and critics also did not really approve. It is not for everybody. The human characters sometimes are also moving and talking like zombies I must say. Still all in all, I believe this was a good watch. You should check it out perhaps. Also it did feel really Jarmusch to me, like some of the quotes and dialogues could have been taken right out of Coffee and Cigarettes if you ask me. So if you like the filmmaker, go see it. But don't expect greatness. Even I as a huge Bill Murray fan, who also likes Driver, cannot say this was a great movie. Certainly inferior to his previous release Patterson, if it is even possible to compare these two. The subjects could not be any more different.",The Dead Don't Die
3,claudio_carvalho,Zombies by Jim Jarmusch,5,10 September 2019,"In Centerville, the undead rise when there is a shift in the axis of rotation of Earth. ""The Dead Don't Die"" is the slow development of this storyline following several dwellers of this town. Films by Jim Jarmusch are usually cult and slow paced. His navigation through the zombie genre is an uneven film, with at least a good surprise like the flying saucer scene and many boring and unfunny moments. The cast composed by many veteran actors and actresses is a plus but the final result is neither cult nor worthwhile spending 1h 44 min watching. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Os Mortos Não Morrem"" (""The Dead Don't Die"")",The Dead Don't Die
4,nogodnomasters,This is all going to end badly.,8,8 September 2019,"In the fictional Western Pa. town of Centerville ( a real nice place near Latrobe) the dead come back to life because of polar fracking which is also lengthening the days. Bill Murray who got his head blown off in his previous zombie film returns as Chief Cliff Robertson. The town of less than 800 people has its own TV station, motel, and restaurant. The earth's rotation is also a mess extending the day. Hermit Bob (Tom Waits) is our voice of reason, a role that has Woody Harrelson written all over it. At the end, he explains the zombie metaphor. Bill Murray gets to kill Carol Kane who haunted him in ""Scrooged."" The skewed day appears to be a homage to ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" famous for its day then suddenly night scenes as Ed Wood didn't think anyone would notice. Tilda Swinton reminded me of Uma Thurman from ""Kill Bill"" as she plays a Scottish Samurai undertaker. George Romero is mentioned when a Pontiac Lemans drives up, although it was the wrong year and color. The biggest building in this small town was the Juvenile Correction Center. Steve Buscemi plays a bigot whose coffee is ""too black"" and wears a cap, ""Make America White Again"" around Danny Glover, an activist in real life. Iggy Pop walks around as a zombie with a pot of decaf. Sturgill Simpson whose soundtrack was plugged many times, also plays a zombie dragging a guitar. Rosie Perez has her name changed a bit as newscaster Posie Juarez. Adam Driver who plays Kylo Ren on ""Star Wars"" has a Star Wars key chain. And I know I must have missed a dozen with Caleb Landry Jones playing a pop culture geek. Loved the details.Guide; F-word. No sex or nudity.",The Dead Don't Die
5,kosmasp,Where is the 4th wall?,8,2 August 2019,"From very early on you can feel that the movie (script) is acknowledging the viewer. The moment it should be clear for everybody is when the theme song is playing on the radio - the explanation for it is something to behold. But the movie also gives nods to the actors involved and their previous work. Be it in film or music.Just because this is funny though, it doesn't hold back on the gory and visceral elements of a horror/zombie movie. Why Jim Jarmusch decide to do this, I don't know, but either he is a real fan (nods to Romero, cliches being included and so forth) of the genre or he read up on it. Whatever the case, if you don't mind silly and self deprecating humor, you will be very amused by this and entertained of course. If you are faint of hearted, easily offended or just can't bring yourself to laugh at certain things ... you will be annoyed. Still this sticks to its guns (no pun intended) and is consistent from start to finish",The Dead Don't Die
6,classicsoncall,"""I'm saying, full-on zombie apocalypse, baby!""",6,17 November 2019,"I don't go in for the straight zombie flicks so much, but I do enjoy the parodies. This one held promise at face value but fails to live up to the standards of ""Zombieland"" and ""Shaun of the Dead""; 'Shaun' was especially hilarious. What I liked here was the dead-pan sensibility of Bill Murray's character, the police chief of a fictitious town called Centerville (unless this took place in Virginia, because there IS a Centerville there). But it seemed like the running gag of Deputy Sheriff Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) and his repetitious 'going to end badly' mantra did get a little tiresome after a while. Easter eggs abound for those intent on finding them, the characters of Posie Juarez and Zelda Winston were portrayed by actresses who's real names were slightly modified, i.e., Rosie Perez and Tilda Swinton. And if you have to, go back and take a second look at Hermit Bob (Tom Waits), a dead ringer look-a-like for the Cowardly Lion in ""The Wizard of Oz"" but without the lion suit. Overall though, the film tends to lose energy as it goes on, and the transition near the end of the story with Samurai mortician Ms. Winston going Zombie X-Files didn't have any kind of connection to the main plot at all. I expected just a bit more from the undead concept than what the picture offered, but at least it was a kick seeing Bill Murray graduate from a ghost buster to a zombie killer.",The Dead Don't Die
7,lee_eisenberg,"""Could it be that we're having so much work because the dead have been rising from their graves?""",9,7 January 2020,"Erstwhile Ghostbuster Bill Murray battles the dead again, only this time it's zombies. Jim Jarmusch turns the genre on its head with ""The Dead Don't Die"", setting the movie up like a B movie (I particularly liked the investigation at the diner). They must've had a lot of fun making this movie. An enjoyable one.",The Dead Don't Die
8,paul_haakonsen,"Oh wow, this was dreadful...",3,5 September 2019,"Seriously?I had such high hopes for this movie. I mean, a zombie horror comedy with a star crammed cast, as this was all that director and writer Jim Jarmusch could muster? This was such a disappointing movie in so many, many ways.First of all, the storyline and the pacing of the movie was just atrocious. The movie was unfathomably slow paced to the point of where boredom was starting to set in and you were really to just hold out a hand and let a zombie chomp down on your flesh.And when the movie finally does pick up pace, which wasn't very much actually, it wasn't much of an improvement. Especially since the storyline and script was essentially non-existing and just rubbish.Sure, the zombie aspect of the movie was good, and it was that which lured me to watch the movie after all, as I am a fan of all things zombie. But this was just way, way too boring. And then suddenly a flying saucer turned up, and people started to talk about a script implying that they were in a movie. I was good and ready to just get up and walk out on ""The Dead Don't Die"" at that point. But I stuck with it to the end, to the boring, prolonged and boring end.The zombie make-up was good, so that at least counted for something, but it wasn't enough to make up for everything else where the movie either lacked, came in short or just didn't even bother to make an effort.Now, the movie does have a very impressive assembly of cast, which includes Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tom Waits, Chloë Sevigny, Steve Buscemi and Danny Glover.There was a healthy dose of sarcasm in the movie, small bits and pieces that you might not pick up on. But that was actually a nice thing about the movie, such as Adam Driver's character having a Star Destroyer keyring, zombies walking with mobile phones groaning ""wifi"", zombies drinking coffee and groaning ""coffee"", Buscemi's red cap with a slogan that openly mocks Trump's slogan, and odd bits and pieces like that could be found throughout the movie.Sadly ""The Dead Don't Die"" is not a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, because it was just horribly boring and so slow paced that even the zombies were going ""hey, Jim Jarmusch, you mind picking up the pace?""My rating of ""The Dead Don't Die"" is going to be settling on a very low three out of ten stars. The movie had potential, but it failed in almost every aspect. The comedy in the movie was flaccid and just infantile. The storyline and plot was abysmal. And it was a massive swing and a miss of something that could have been such a glorious thing...The movie was, in lack of better terms, dreadful. And it being a zombie movie makes me cringe just having to admit to saying that about it. But hey, not everything zombiesque is amazing, huh?",The Dead Don't Die
9,Coventry,"Congratulations, Jarmusch, for ruining the ONE genre that practically cannot be ruined!",2,19 April 2021,"Films like ""The Dead don't Die"" make me feel dumb. And, of course, like every normal person in the world, I don't like it when something or someone makes me feel dumb. Why does it make you feel dumb? Because you can't help thinking that you're missing the point. That you're not seeing what everybody else must be seeing. Why else would so many great actors and actresses want to star in an ordinary horror movie with zombies if it wasn't great? Well, I can assure you, there's nothing wrong with us. Jim Jarmusch probably likes to think that his films are arthouse and that his humor is deadpan, but in reality, it's just a bunch of pretentious drivel.Jarmusch did accomplish one thing, though. It's practically impossible to ruin a zombie movie, but somehow, he managed. Young, inexperienced and amateur film makers put together better zombie movies than Jarmusch does; - at least when it comes to plot and atmosphere. Not in terms of acting performances and budget for special effects, obviously. 90% of ""The Dead don't Die"" is dull and derivative of nearly every single zombie movie ever made previously. The remaining 10% is embarrassing beyond words, with the weakest attempt at ""meta-horror"" I've ever seen (""How do you know it's not going to end well? Because I read the script"") and the totally random fate of Tilda Swinton's character.",The Dead Don't Die
10,bevo-13678,Zombies are sick,10,28 September 2020,Donno Reckoned I wouldn't give this 10 stars. But I did!!!,The Dead Don't Die
11,zardoz-13,"""The Dead Don't Die"" won't make you die from laughter",5,24 September 2019,"Imagine what would have happened had zombies invaded Mayberry on ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" and you may be amused by arthouse filmmaker Jim Jarmusch's ""The Dead Don't Die,"" co-starring Bill Murray and Adam Driver as two clueless small-town cops combatting the first contingent of a zombie apocalypse. Lukewarm and lightweight, this R-rated, 104-minute, comedy chiller serves as Jarmusch's homage to late Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, filmmaker George A. Romero. Universally recognized as the godfather of zombie movies, Romero reinvented 'the undead' in 1968, with his black & white, post-modern, masterpiece ""Night of the Living Dead."" Thousands of imitations, sadistic, sincere, and silly, have since ensued. Notable titles include ""Return of the Living Dead"" (1985), ""Shaun of the Dead,"" (2004), ""Zombieland"" (2009), ""Juan of the Dead"" (2011), and ""Train to Busan"" (2016). Indeed, the genre exhibits no signs of dying out. In his largely traditional zombie comedy, Jarmusch sticks to Romero's basic rules, while he tweaks the zombie formula with humor. Every character is eccentric, and most turn into zombies before fadeout. Basically, ""The Dead Don't Die"" is a by-the-numbers rehash of Romero's movies, but Jarmusch concentrates more on message than mayhem.
You may ogle every frame of ""The Dead Don't Die"" without fear of screaming in abject terror. Apart from an occasional gut-gnawing moment, Jarmusch doesn't wallow in cheap splatter gore. Indeed, while he has made an anemic horror potboiler, with decapitations galore, he has adopted a tongue-in-cheek nonchalance. Jarmusch does virtually everything to undercut any modicum of either suspense or tension. Zombie movies thrive on social commentary, and Jarmusch exploits that potential as a source of humor. Furthermore, one self-aware character knows how everything will end. Seems he has read a version of the script! Gorehounds will classify ""The Dead Don't Die"" as frivolous because the gore is only ankle deep. Writer & director Jarmusch isn't so much interested in zombies as the people who must contend with them. Zombie attacks constitute the equivalent of domestic supernatural terrorism because these fiends arise from within the system!Predictable from fade-in to fadeout, ""The Dead Don't Die"" qualifies as a dry, deadpan exercise in supernatural horror. Jarmusch treats us to a charming depiction of the kind of small-town America immortalized by illustrator Norman Rockwell in his vintage ""Saturday Evening Post"" cover art for 50 years. Nobody could be any more conventional than Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray of ""Ghostbusters"") and Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver of ""Logan Lucky"") of the local constabulary. They are comparable to Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife on ""The Andy Griffith show"" (1960-1968). Friendly, personable, and sympathetic describes them. They don't behave like gung-ho, Rambo types. Everything is down to earth in Centerville until the dead arise and storm the township in droves. Eventually, around 54 minutes into the action, Cliff asks Ronnie for advice about how to kill a zombie.Jarmusch does a solid job of establishing the small-town setting of Centerville, Pop. 738, advertising itself on its Welcome Sign as ""a real nice place."" No sooner has the film unfolded than some trifling things trouble Cliff and Ronnie. Cliff argues it should be dark at 8:20 pm, yet the overhead sun is still ablaze. Meanwhile, after his wristwatch inexplicably stops ticking, Ronnie observes: ""Yeah, something weird's going on."" Later, Ronnie displays his cynicism, ""This isn't going to end well, Cliff."" Officer Mindy Morrison (Chloë Sevigny of ""Kids"") raises them on their police radio and reports other bizarre events before interference garbles her words. After they lose Mindy's signal, Ronnie brandishes his cell phone. Incredibly, he discovers his freshly charged battery is kaput. When they switch over to regular radio, all they can tune in is Sturgill Simpson crooning his woebegone country ballad ""The Dead Don't Die."" This marks the first time Ronnie realizes he may be more self-aware about what evil the future portends than anybody else.As our protagonists cruise back to the police department, Cliff drives past the Centerville Juvenile Detention Center and later the local diner where Farmer Frank Miller (Steve Buscemi of ""Reservoir Dogs"") and Hank Thompson (Danny Glover of ""Lethal Weapon"") are chatting with their waitress Fern (Eszter Balint of ""The Linguini Incident""). Frank wears a red baseball cap emblazoned with the phrase ""Keep America White Again."" Fern listens to the radio while newscasters blame polar fracking for the Earth being knocked off its axis. They attribute all ills and evils, including the dead rising from graves, to the shift in the Earth's axis.When the first zombies appear about 30 minutes into the movie, they munch on both Fern and the diner's cleaning lady. The day after the discovery of the bodies, Cliff and Ronnie ponder the crime. Ronnie contends zombies rather than wild animals feasted on the unfortunate women. Predictably, Cliff is flabbergasted by the outlandish idea of zombies. Eventually, as the zombie numbers multiply, the social order collapses around our heroes. Three juveniles (Taliyah Whitaker, Jahi Di'Allo Winston, and Maya Delmont) escape from the Centerville Juvenile Detention facility and dodge the undead. Like crazy Hermit Bob (Tom Waits of ""Seven Psychopaths"") who eluded Cliff and Ronnie in the film's first scene, the juvenile trio escape inevitable death at the hands of the cannibalistic zombie horde. At one point, Officer Mindy spots her Granny, sentiment overwhelms her, and she plunges into the ravenous pack of flesh eaters. Cliff still cannot believe his eyes. At fadeout, Ronnie and he find themselves surrounded completely by legions of the undead. Ironically, most of these people were their friends before they became zombies. The oddball character who steals the show is Tilda Swinton's Scottish undertaker Zelda Winston. Winston worships Buddha and wields a wicked katana. She slashes her weight in zombies before she vanishes aboard a saucer-shaped spaceship. Bill Murray and Adam Driver headline a sterling celebrity cast that cannot salvage this insipid zombie saga that skewers its horror with humor. Altogether, ""The Dead Don't Die"" is tame by zombie movie standards.",The Dead Don't Die
12,Calicodreamin,Stupid,3,29 June 2019,"I guess I get that this was supposed to be a satire of a zombie outbreak. But even for that it's dull and boring.

13,george.schmidt,"""This Won't End Well"" - Murray & Company try their best while Jarmusch finds his inner Romero",7,14 June 2019,"THE DEAD DON'T DIE (2019 **1/2 Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Chloe Sevigny, Tilda Swinton, Steve Buscemi, Danny Glover, Tom Waits, Caleb Landry Jones, RZA, Larry Fessenden, Rosie Perez, Carol Kane, Iggy Pop, Sara Driver, Selena Gomez, Esztter Balint, Rosal Colon. Indie filmmaker Jim Jarmusch gets in touch with his inner George A. Romero in this funky yet somewhat disappointing zombie comedy about a small-town facing end of the world changes - the earth is off its axis and the dead are returning to life with predictable tropes embedded and underscored (Driver's deadpan police officer's refrain of ""This won't end well"" and his well-known use of horror lore are key throughout the carnage involved). While I can see why the director (who also wrote the Saltine-dry screenplay) attempts to shake things up in it final act all I can say is 'um, no you shouldn't have'. Murray's sheriff and Swinton's ethereal funeral director are a hoot, as well as Waits' Greek chorus as the town's hermit, as expected but the rest of the cast is sorely wasted (literally).",The Dead Don't Die
14,ferguson-6,Jarmusch uses zombies to make a statement,6,13 June 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. Love it or hate it. Sometimes it's not that easy. Sometimes it is. Filmmaker Jim Jarmusch has been making his own brand of videos, shorts, documentaries and features since the 1980's. He has a loyal following of viewers who ""get"" him, and even within those ranks there is debate about which of his projects work and which don't. You know who doesn't care? Jim Jarmusch, that's who. He creates the work he wants to create and works with the actors and crew that he wants to work with ... he's best described as the type who lets the art speak for itself.As we pull into town, the billboard states ""Welcome to Centerville. A real nice place. Population 738"". It's a bland town with a bland name filled with bland people whose bland conversations focus on doughnuts and pie from the town's only diner. The police force totals 3 (seems high for such a small town). Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) is the veteran police chief, while Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) and Mindy Morrison (Chloe Sevigny) are the deputies ... all three are bespectacled.Initial interactions provide a quick lay of the land. Farmer Frank (a loud-mouthed Steve Buscemi) accuses Hermit Bob (Tom Waits) of stealing his chicken. Hermit Bob lives in the woods and doesn't take kindly to accusations. Frank, despite his racist core, is somehow friendly with Hank (Danny Glover), a mild-mannered local who chats it up at the diner. Bobby Wiggins (Caleb Landry Jones) is the town's pop culture guru who runs the gas station/comic book store.Even this law enforcement team recognizes strange things are happening: the sun doesn't set when it should, watches are stopped, and animals are disappearing. We hear news reports that 'polar fracking' has knocked the earth off its axis, coupled with government denials stating jobs are plentiful and profits are up. Obviously this is Jarmusch taking his shots at the environmental policies and focus on the economy of the current administration. Our first zombie attack happens at the diner (of course) and features Sara Driver (Jarmusch's long-time partner) and Iggy Pop (who requires little make-up to be convincing as a zombie). Many more zombies follow.While Murray's Cliff and Mr. Driver's Ronnie maintain their deadpan conversations and reactions, it's Ms. Sevigny's Mindy who is terrified in the face of their nonchalance. Adding color to the mix is Tilda Swinton as Zelda, the samurai sword wielding mortician with a Scottish accent, a flair for make-up and an other-worldly secret. Also appearing are Selena Gomez, Carol Kane, Rosie Perez and RZA.As the opening film at this year's Cannes Film Festival, it's a blend of comedy, fantasy, horror, zombie, and social commentary ... but none of the pieces are particularly effective. It's somehow both wry and mundane, and not meant to be traditionally scary or laugh out loud funny. Jarmusch has delivered such diverse films as PATERSON (2016), ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE (2013), and BROKEN FLOWERS (2005). ""This isn't going to end well"" is a line Driver's Ronnie states a few times, and it's both foreshadowing and self-awareness from the filmmaker. It's his commentary on the state of the world, as well as the movie.Zombie-comedies have been done (SHAUN OF THE DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD and many others), and it's usually best to bring something new to a tired genre. Instead, Jarmusch pays tribute to such films as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, KILL BILL, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, PSYCHO, and STAR WARS. He even tips his cap to Samuel Fuller (gravestone) and George Romero (a 1969 Pontiac LeMans). As if to acknowledge the love-hate factor that goes with his movies, Jarmusch allows Sturgill Simpson's (also appearing as the guitar-zombie) theme song to exemplify such division. Selena's character and Ronnie love the song, while Murray's Cliff can't stand it and flings the disc out of the car window.You are likely wondering if the world needs yet another take on the zombie apocalypse. Of course, the answer is no ... which means in Hollywood, there are countless more zombie apocalypse TV series and movies (numerous sequels) in the works. Jarmusch isn't here to simply add another number to the genre. No, he uses the format to proclaim that our society is soul-dead. He believes we are all stumbling, zombie-like, through life, rattling off our favorite products. He may be right.",The Dead Don't Die
15,Wizard-8,MIsfires in almost all its intentions,3,11 October 2019,"As you may have heard, this movie sets out to be a horror/comedy movie, specifically a spoof of the zombie genre. But with its main intents - to be horrific and funny - it fails extremely badly.I'll start off by saying how the movie goes wrong with its horror side. The movie takes FOREVER for the building zombie apocalypse to reach a point where the characters start to fully realize they have a problem on their hands. I think I had to wait until the halfway point before the problem becomes big enough. And when that point has been reached, there isn't a real feeling of ever-increasing menace or panic - the zombies just move around slowly for the most part, with the human characters taking the situation way too lightly. Also, when there is a scene of direct battling of zombies, it's too soft and unconvincing, made worse that the CGI effects depicting everything from blood to decapitations is pretty unconvincing.Yes, I know that the movie has an (intended) comic side, so that we should not view the zombie attacks with complete seriousness, but the problem is that the comedy is desperately unfunny. It's too deadpan for the most part, and when it gets more jokey, the level of humor is so lazy and unoriginal that even a 12 year old wouldn't find it funny. (A character saying that they already read the script for this movie? Oh, ha ha, very funny!)There are additional problems with the movie, such as characters that seem to serve no purpose (why are the juvenile delinquents given so much screen time when they don't get a definite and proper conclusion or exit?) The only merit I can think of that is in the movie is that writer/director Jim Jarmusch does capture the look and feel of small town America very well, and that I will admit that the movie is never boring despite its problems. But despite not being bored, the failed horror and lame comedy made me deeply regret picking up this movie from my local library. It's easy to see why the theatrical distributor only gave the movie a half-hearted theatrical release.",The Dead Don't Die
16,trashgang,sssssslllllllllooooooooowwwww but worth picking up for the forgotten thespians,5,24 September 2019,"This is a difficult one to review because it's full of well known actors from the past and two rock and roll idols so on that part it's a delight to see them perform again. On the other hand the movie is slow, and that will be a turn-off for so many geeks.If you are into zombies I should say try it out because they are in it and they do bite. Never on the gory part but still, it's zombiefied all over. For me it's more about the sarcasm all over this flick. Due that fact it makes it slow.Effects are mediocre and indeed, some actors are just in it for a minute or a bit more but they deliver their parts as it should be done. Agreed on so many reviews of thos one, if you are sleepy due the slowness it is possible that you will fall asleep.Still, no plot at all, nothing explained (maybe the earth itself) and going nowhere it is one for the geeks itself.

17,christopher-underwood,Tilda Swinton is as good as I remember seeing her,8,18 July 2019,"It is clear that everyone had fun making this and it is enjoyable to watch. Just once or twice, perhaps because it is so laconic and laid back, the movie seems to stop. There is, for instance, a scene where the police car is besieged and the scene is stunning to begin with, then a little over long and then in suspension with nothing happening. Overall though this is fun with plenty of cinematic references and in jokes. Tilda Swinton is as good as I remember seeing her for a long time, Scottish accent attempt not withstanding. Bill Murray seems below par and indeed his timing lapses become slightly embarrassing. Tom Waits, however, who I would not have recognised is fantastic. The direction is fine with some lovely cinematography, particularly in the woods and of various shop and diner fronts (and interiors).",The Dead Don't Die

The acting was as good as possible, considering the simplistic cardboard characters, the humor was mostly situational and not a lot, but there was no actual story.

19,blanbrn,Dark horror zombie comedy that's fun yet not serious.,6,24 June 2019,"""The Dead Don't Die"" is one independent film that doesn't have much of a plot, yet it entertains and thrills with one liners and dark humor as it's a little parody of George Romero flicks like ""Night of the Living Dead,"" and ""Creepshow"" as these zombies will not die and they rise from the grave and eat flesh! Set in a rural town called Centerville the graveyard comes alive after the town is plagued with loss of cell phone service, and it seems like night and day is mixed up as the time of day seems strange. Plus pets and animals start to vanish plus some blood and gore is added with plenty of laughs. And the lineup features some film favorites like Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Chloe Sevigny, Steve Buscemi, and Carol Kane. Overall nothing special or fantastic it's just a film that has fun with one liners and thinking that the end of the world might end with an army of zombies.",The Dead Don't Die

21,MOscarbradley,Minor Jarmusch is always so much better than the best of many of his peers.,8,3 August 2019,"Jim Jarmusch claims he made ""The Dead Don't Die"" because he wanted to make an entertainment that the general public could relate to and simply have fun watching. Showing it at Cannes, of course, also suggests he had one eye on the critics too, though they have been less than enthusiastic, hoping perhaps he might emulate his vampire masterpiece ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" and yes, if you are expecting a retread of that you will be disappointed. However, if you go to ""The Dead Don't Die"" wanting nothing more than a good, gory and very funny slice of schlock-horror you will love it as much as I did.
Of course, Jarmusch being Jarmusch can't content himself with a simple send-up; he has to go down the post-modern route of referencing the fact that it's only a film and a Jim Jarmusch film at that, so we have characters talking about reading the script and that the much played title song is, indeed, the film's theme song but these are the weakest aspects of Jarmusch's comedy. Otherwise this is a full-frontal assault on the funny-bone..You can ignore what passes for a plot, suffice to say ""Night of the Living Dead"" is a good jumping off point, and relish a cast of Jarmusch regulars, (Adam Driver, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Iggy Pop, Tom Waits etc), having a ball. Driver and Swinton may have the best of it, showing that even in a pastiche like this they still have the acting chops to carry it off. It's not flawless; the build-up to this zombie apocalypse takes too long and a few of the gags are repeated long past their sell-by date but I still laughed longer and harder at this than at any other movie I've seen this year and if it's minor Jarmusch, it still shows that even minor Jarmusch is often so much better than many of his peers.",The Dead Don't Die
22,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"What, are we improvising here?",3,14 July 2019,"Jim Jarmusch's latest is about as tired and stale as the reanimated corpses it sees crawl their way out of the ground. Despite its pretences - and, I suppose, genuine intentions - of disassembling the genre, 'The Dead Don't Die (2019)' feels years behind the curve, intent on riffing on old tropes and claiming it's 'avant-garde' for doing so. It tries so hard to be 'post-modern' - often by, essentially, breaking the fourth wall - that it actually breaks its own narrative, asking us to believe that its characters are both in mortal danger and acutely aware that they're in a movie. Obviously, these two ideas clash and all but ruin any semblance of diegesis; what's worse is that they're not in service of anything, not even the apparent point that the piece tries to make. Much of this stuff comes across as being different just for the sake of being different, regardless of any actual improvement, and there's a sense that the flick finds these 'random' things inexplicably funny. Of course, no-one else does. It's like we're watching an extended, outdated inside joke. Apparently, having nobody act like a real person is a part of that. There's deadpan, there's bizarrely disconnected and then there's this. If the people about to be eaten don't really care, why should we? All of this stems from an attempt to be knowing in a 'post-modern' kind of way, one that seemingly mistakes the movement's skepticism for a near contempt. One can challenge the pre-established norms of cinema and, specifically, genre while still delivering a smart, enjoyable and cohesive experience. This doesn't do that, often - it appears - by design. Doing something by design doesn't make it good, though. That's why Jarmusch doesn't get any points even in the very likely scenario that he made the thing wanting reactions exactly like this one. He probably knew that it would attract wider audiences than his usual fare - thanks to its mainstream marketing, all-star cast and, well, wide release - and anticipated disappointment from the 'popcorn munching masses' who were sold a straight-forward, slightly absurdist comedy and are, thus, the 'real zombies'. The obvious problem with that is that even those who expected a distinctly 'Jarmusch' experience, including most critics, found the feature to be a let-down, even when only stacked against the director's own other work. I fall into the latter category. I know what to expect from a 'Jarmusch' experience - I mean, 'Paterson (2016)' is apparently about nothing yet somehow says quite a bit in a rather enjoyable way - but I found this so-called zombie movie to be soulless and dull. It's doing so much, yet doing it badly. Let me be clear, I understand what it's going for. I get it, I just don't like it. It's nothing new, especially its underlying claim that maybe 'we've been zombies all along' (Romero, much?), but it seems to think it is. Worse than all of this, than everything I've mentioned thus far, is the fact that it's cripplingly boring. If the audience look like zombies to you, Jim, it's because you've bored them to death. 3/10",The Dead Don't Die
23,bowmanblue,"Nothing new, but nicely done",8,29 April 2020,"I know, I know... this is ANOTHER zombie movie. Twenty years ago that might have been met with a collective gasp, but nowadays we've seen pretty much every type of zombie movie there is to make. Even the once great 'The Walking Dead' is slowly slipping from public relevance. So, is 'The Dead Don't Die' worth a watch? Well, first of all it's a 'zom-com.' Again, that might have been different if 'Shaun of the Dead' hadn't stolen the spotlight around fifteen years ago. In short... 'The Dead Don't Die' doesn't offer a single thing that's different to any other sub-genre of a typical film, but that doesn't mean you should necessarily skip it.I guess the main thing this film has going for it is its cast. The ever-dry Bill Murray plays a small-town Sherriff who finds himself caught up in one of those typical zombie apocalypse settings. He's backed up with well-known actors like Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, Danny Glover and Steve Buscemi , so with a cast like that you know you're going to get a few good performances.It's quite self-knowing and some of the humour does tend to be a little 'meta' in places, plus there are some simply random elements that you'll never see coming (but I think that's the point!). The 'random' element is good when it comes to humour and surprises, but I felt that - due to the large cast list - many characters' stories don't really go anywhere and some seem to be originally set up to play some big, important part of the story, only for them to get killed off screen and that's the end of them.Perhaps the film's budget went on paying so many recognisable actors to star in it, because if you're expecting some sort of wall-to-wall gore fest then you won't find it here. Most of the gore is very obviously computer-generated and there isn't really even much in the way of 'comedy over-the-top' violence like other films such as the afore-mentioned 'Shaun of the Dead.''The Dead Don't Die' does tend to suffer from all the typical zombie movie tropes, but the cast are good enough to pull it off so that if you're in the mood for something funny (or should I say 'dry?') to go with your run-of-the-mill zombie movie then I'd definitely give this one a watch. Bill Murray makes it, but credit to Tilda Swinton for her memorable role as a Scottish Samurai mortician and Adam Driver for a role with numerous 'Star Wars' references.",The Dead Don't Die
24,ThomasDrufke,Zom-Com,6,9 July 2019,"Some of the best zombie films have blended horror and comedy i.e. Shaun of the Dead & Zombieland. 'The Dead Don't Die' attempts to do the same, and to largely successful results. The cast is superbly diverse in personality types, which makes for each scene feeling genuinely realistic (in a supernatural/fantastical setting). I loved watching Adam Driver and Bill Murray monotonously walk through an apocalyptic world killing zombies and saving civillians. There's something so special about Jim Jarmusch's world he builds with the wide variety of characters that inhabit it. But even that won't necessarily separate it from anything we have seen before from the zombie sub-genre.6.8/10",The Dead Don't Die
25,MLDinTN,a zombie movie without a point,2,10 March 2020,"This movie has basically no plot. Sure zombies appear and that's about it. The film is filled with lame jokes, the only thing I found funny was the different characters repeating ""it was a wild animal or several wild animals"". The chief and his deputy do nothing. And what was with the kids in the detention center. They get no conclusion. Then the space ship and picking up the mortician with the samurai sword. What was that supposed to mean. All this movie showed was how a bunch of lame characters get killed by zombies and they do very little fighting back.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty bad. I don't think even zombie fans will like it. You're better off watching the Walking Dead.",The Dead Don't Die
26,Cineanalyst,Hipsters with Their Irony,5,24 October 2019,"As the quotation from this zombie movie and the title of this comment indicates, Jim Jarmusch's ""The Dead Don't Die"" is a self-parody of its own sardonic treatment of the horror film genre and the zombie craze in particular. I don't mind the pacing and other idiosyncratic tendencies here characteristic of Jarmusch's oeuvre, and at least I found this one amusing at times, but it's ultimately a futile endeavor. Bill Murray and Adam Driver breaking the fourth wall as small-town police officers can be funny, but, as Driver's deputy repeatedly states, it ends badly. Meanwhile, Tilda Swinton plays out the auteur's continuing fascination with Japanese culture by wielding a katana in front of a Buddha statue, which is otherwise as trivial as watching Michonne in ""The Walking Dead."" Of course, in the tradition of ""Scream"" (1996) and other obnoxiously-meta movies, there's a comic-book and film buff who explains what's going on in the movie, which is redundant here given that Driver's deputy does the same thing, while the forest hermit explains the moral. Most of the rest of the cast full of recognizable stars play out one-note jokes, if even that. Steve Buscemi, for instance, wears a parody of a MAGA hat, and everyone hates him.Then, rolling up into this Centerville of Jarmusch's idea of a slice of Americana are three young hipsters from Ohio, seemingly aimlessly driving through as if straight out of ""Stranger Than Paradise"" (1984). They make fun of others, and others make fun of them. Hipsters as the butt of a joke in an ostentatiously-ironic movie made by a hipster--how ironic. There's even a listless satire tacked on, because, I suppose, George A. Romero did it when he revived this undead trend 50-odd years ago--commenting on racial issues in ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) and materialism in ""Dawn of the Dead"" (1978). Thus, ""Dead Don't Die"" features politicians lying about the benefits and safety of ""polar fracking"" and Zombies either repeating the brand name of their favorite merchandise or staring at smart phones. Plus, there's the kids in prison, the ""Keep American White Again"" hat, and the hermit picks up a copy of John Milton's ""Paradise Lost,"" just in case anyone didn't get the doubled point about the fall of man and the Frankenstein-esque rising from the grave. Much of all of this comes across as forced, more lethargic than deadpan and, oxymoronically, self-knowingly pretentious, but whether it's intentionally comedic or laughably bad, at least Jarmusch is making fun of himself here, too.",The Dead Don't Die
27,Bored_Dragon,Shamefully underrated,8,29 February 2020,"I can't understand why people are disappointed with this movie. If you are a fan of classic zombie horror, you have nothing to look for in a Jim Jarmusch movie, to begin with. On the other hand, if you're a Jarmusch fan, I don't know how you didn't expect exactly what you got. I'm honestly surprised by Jarmusch's choice of theme and genre, but when I accept that choice, the realization is more than satisfactory. An excellent satire of both modern consumer society and the zombie genre itself, filmed in typically Jarmusch's style. For those who complain about the slow pace and lack of real plot, I have only one question - have you ever watched anything from Jarmusch? It is not one of his best, but it is a great movie, very well shot, interestingly played and quite humorous. I only missed the excellent music that distinguished his previous films, which on this occasion was sacrificed for the sake of a pretty good joke.8/10",The Dead Don't Die

While the film has some stupid awkward humor. It does not leave any room for laughs or excitement. It started out great. The film has some funny references to George Romero's zombie films. The film story follows Police officer Ronnie (Adam Driver) and Cliff (Bill Murray) as they notice strange occurences around the town. From the days being longer with the sun out at 8 pm. The animals and pets going missing. The cell phone services are out. And the dead are rising from the grave. Sounds like a bigger problem that Cliff and Ronnie have yet to anticipate.The concept and plot does have a theme put in there. Just adding zombies for the characters to face against. Sadly, the narrative theme just does not play well on screen. The characters are written to be awkward and weird. It does have very few funny moments. Otherwise, the humor dries up quick and is dull throughout.The script tries to be wise with its humor but it gets old fast. It is boring. The film has a twist that is random and just weird with the final moments of the movie. Nothing really gets resolved with other characters which we can assume they were killed off screen.Overall, The Dead Don't Die is a pretty bad film.

Bill Murray and Adam Driver are the leads and are quite standard. Murray becomes annoying as the film progresses. Tilda Swinton perhaps stands out as she steals her scenes in a bizarre character type.The Dead Don't Die just isn't funny or really creative enough. The plot is repetitive but in the end we do see the dots being connected, with the unrelated characters intersecting.Still not much is explained. It's never mentioned how suddenly the zombies all rise from the dead at the same time.There are some decent scenes of violence (with the characters using weapons to chop off the zombies heads).Furthermore nothing was suspenseful but rather predictable, and the overall tone was simply flat.

34,eddie_baggins,A slow and uneventful letdown,4,19 September 2019,"You know what you're getting with a Jim Jarmusch film, with the popular indie filmmaker carving out a long career filled with dead-pan humour and true to life character studies, with memorable efforts such as Broken Flowers, Dead Man, Ghost Dog and Only Lovers Left Alive establishing a strong C.V for the long standing director, yet while Jarmusch's delivery is to be expected and cast typically loaded with talent, zombie dramedy The Dead Don't Die never shuffles into anything worth recommending in what's a seriously forgettable and lethargic outing for all involved.It's hard to know exactly what possessed Jarmusch to enter into the zombie genre, a category of film and entertainment that has reached saturation point many moons ago as while Dead looks to differ itself from other corpse filled offerings by saying its zombie plague is all due to a shift of the earth's axis and global warming happenings, nothing else in the film feels new and fresh when so much has already played out in similar fashions.For funny zombie rides we have efforts like Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland or for serious efforts we have our Dawn of the Dead's and 28 Days Later's and all the minor offerings in between and Dead just does nothing we haven't seen before, which isn't always a game ending issue but when it does it in such a manner that plays out here (by the numbers and highly unengaging) there's issues that arise and can't be overcome.Things all start out in slowly plotted and potentially great set-ups with Bill Murray and Adam Driver's small-town cops Cliff Robertson and Ronnie Peterson on patrol in Centerville as they come across some strange happenings and town locals like Steve Buscemi's angry farmer Frank Miller, Danny Glover's kindly Hank, Tom Waits homeless woods dweller Hermit Bob or Tilda Swinton's samurai sword wielding mortician Zelda, but Dead never seems to get out of first gear and even when the zombies start patrolling the streets and the body count rises, Jarmusch never appears to be interested in making things any more engaging or adrenaline filled as the laughs slow to a trickle and interest levels wane.There's no doubt that Dead could've been great, the trailer we first glimpsed of the film showed off its potential and there are moments throughout the film where the likes of Driver and Murray show a great chemistry together that's barely explored and some characters appear at first to be far more intriguing that they're ever allowed to be thanks to minimal screen time and even more minimal moments that matter.When all is said and done Dead feels like nothing more than a half-hashed zombie effort that fails to differentiate itself from a crowded collection of similar outings and even with a great cast, a strong core concept and a few moments of darkly humorous occurrences, Jarmusch's foray into the land of the dead is one many will forget almost instantaneously.Final Say -With little heart or soul this dead filled horror/comedy hybrid is a massive miss-step for a usually solid filmmaker with Jarmusch failing to maximise his talented cast in an outing that feels like a big waste of time, instead of fun and engaging trip into the bizarre.2 zombie rockstar's out of 5",The Dead Don't Die

The horror elements are also just rather mediocre and just feel like necessary additions because of the genre. So what's left!? Some reviewers say that there is some references to other movies or the movie business to detect, and/or there is some commentaries on our today's society. That all may be right, but mostly the movie is just very slow and won't satisfy neither the horror nor the comedy audience.

36,southdavid,Why?-Lo Ren,5,22 July 2020,"Having not seen ""The Dead Don't Die"" at the cinema, I can only imagine what the reaction was like from the various audiences that went expecting a zombie comedy (which is essentially what the trailer promises) but instead got another rambling treatise on life from auteur Jim Jarmusch.The small town of Centerville is slowly but surely overrun by a hoard of zombies who have risen from their respective graves. The sheriff's department, lead by Chief Robertson (Bill Murray) and supported by Officer Peterson (Adam Driver) and Officer Morrison (Chloe Sevigny), are quick to identify the what's going on, but still seemingly unable to decide what to do about it. Meanwhile, the new undertaker, Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton) gathers data on the town and looks for an opportunity to help.A week or so ago, I wrote a review of ""Jay And Silent Bob Reboot"" in which I said that Smith essentially made a self-indulgent movie, casting all his friends, and not worrying about people who didn't ""get"" it. Jarmusch here does exactly the same thing, the difference being that someone in the Universal Pictures marketing team decided to advertise the film as a much broader and more accessible one than it is, hence the myriad of bad reviews from those who feel conned into seeing it. I was a little more aware of what I was likely to get, and though I felt the film had some moments, it's still more odd and esoteric that it really needs to be, and beyond an homage to ""Night Of The Living Dead"" I'm not sure what points Jarmusch is trying to make. I enjoyed a few of the fourth wall breaking moments, and I liked Tilda Swinton's character whenever she was on screen, but ultimately it hard to come away feeling like this was anything other than friends messing around and then forcing you to sit through the outcome.",The Dead Don't Die

On their way back to the Centerville Police Department, Cliff notices that it should be getting dark by now, but it isn't. We quickly learn that, resulting from polar fracking in both the North and South Pole, the earth's rotation has been slightly altered. It is not long before other strange things start happening... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Jim Jarmush, who previously has brought us a number of outstanding films. If you know Jarmush and don't like his style, by all means stay away from this. If, like me, you in fact do like much of his earlier work, chances are that you will enjoy this ""environmental-based"" zombie flick... to a degree. Half the fun of watching is to figure out who is playing what character. I mean, this is a true all-star ensemble cast (way too many too name in this review), most of which having appeared in earlier Jarmush films. Check out Adam Driver's outstanding performance in Jarmish's previous film, 2016's ""Paterson""--not to be confused with his character ""Peterson"" in this movie. At times, ""The Dead Don't Die"" is a romp. Peterson, from the get-go tells Robertson ""This isn't going to end well"", not once, not twice, but multiple times. But will it? You'll just have to see... Sadly, the movie falters badly in the last 10 min. or so, which left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. Last but not least: ""The Dead Don't Die"" is a new tune from country artist Sturgill Simpson (and it plays about 4-5 times throughout the movie). Other incidental music score is courtesy of the band SQÜRL (of which Jarmush is a member).""The Dead Don't Die"" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival. It opened last weekend with so-so box office results. I finally had a chance to see it this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (5 people, including myself), and the ho-hum reaction this movie has gotten leads me to think its theater run might well be over after 2 weeks. If you have an interest in Jim Jarmush or in zombie moves in general, I'd readily suggest you check it out, be it in the theater (if you still can), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Dead Don't Die

Sturgill Simpson does the title song, which is played several times during the film, and he has a quick cameo as a Zombie-look for the Zombie dragging a guitar. If you like Zombie movies, you should enjoy it. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. It got a little weird.
It's rated ""R"" for Zombie violence/gore, language and some nudity-one shot of a naked Zombie-and has a running time of 1 hour & 44 minutes.
Overall, it was good, except for the ending. I don't know if I would buy it on DVD, but it would be good as a rental.",The Dead Don't Die

44,dar0417,Actionless zombie flick,6,25 September 2019,Had higher expectations on this one but overall it had some good moments and Bill Murray as always was great. The film just dragged on and did not have a lot of zombie action.,The Dead Don't Die
45,drownnnsoda,"Downbeat, atmospheric, and wry take on the zombie genre",7,14 June 2019,"In ""The Dead Don't Die"", a trio of small-town police officers (Bill Murray, Adam Driver, and Chloë Sevigny) attempt to battle a zombie plague of dubious origins. Along with them for this end-of-the-world party are a cast of odd characters, including a nerdy shop proprietor (Caleb Landry Jones), a backward farmer (Steve Buscemi), a kindly hardware store owner (Danny Glover), an unearthly eccentric funeral parlor director (Tilda Swinton), and a group of out-of-town teens led by none other than Selena Gomez.Inarguably Jim Jarmusch's most mainstream effort to date, ""The Dead Don't Die"" is unfortunately not going to appeal to mainstream audiences. Fans of ""The Walking Dead"" will be bored into zombiedom themselves. However, audiences who have the palate for Jarmusch's unique brand of wry humor, and/or are students/fans of the zombie genre at large, will have some mild fun here.Note the qualifier ""mild""; this is not a fast-paced film, nor is it an action flick. It is downbeat, and the thrills and spills here are of an unflashy nature. As I watched it, I felt that perhaps its greatest success was that it managed to perfectly evoke the atmospheric trappings of the zombie films of the '60s and '70s. It goes without saying that ""Night of the Living Dead"" is the chief influence here, but there are moments that recall the feel of lesser-known zombie films such as ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie."" Jarmusch wears his influences on his sleeve, and there are in-jokes everywhere, ranging from cheeky nods to George Romero, to headstones bearing the likes of Samuel Fuller. The film is self-reflexive and silly, playing with the diegesis in audacious ways.While there is humor in Jarmusch's self-aware cheekiness, a great portion of the laughs come from the offbeat dialogue and the performances from his large and impressive cast. Murray essentially does his signature impression of himself, while Adam Driver matches him with deadpan delivery; and Chloë Sevigny is the anxiety-ridden voice of reason who isn't quite as ""in on the joke"" as her male counterparts. Without a doubt, though, Tilda Swinton wrings more humor out of her scenes than anyone else here, and hers are really the funniest moments of the film. Gomez plays her dream girl part aptly, and we get splashes of Buscemi's signature humor as well as an understated nice-guy performance from Danny Glover. The likes of Carol Kane and Iggy Pop make cameos, and Tom Waits portrays the town hermit who delivers a grim (albeit philosophically overwrought) soliloquy in the finale.In the end, this is a film that is sure to alienate much of its audience, but film nerds and appreciators of Jarmusch's sandpapery humor and/or the zombie genre as an artistic enterprise will find slight but effective amusements. 7/10.",The Dead Don't Die
46,lukem-52760,"Meta-Comedy, A Weird Alien Ship & A Terrible Ending Ruined it!!!",2,14 July 2021,"I checked this out because i like Bill Murray of course & i love Zombie films, well some of them, & the very slow start & build-up was decent & interesting as we get to know the local cops on patrol played by Bill Murray & Adam Driver & get to know the locals of this very, very Quiet small American town & all the first half was pretty good in a slow & relaxed way but things get too stupid.Now the big cast is great fun with the likes of Danny Glover & Steve Buscemi & Tilda Swinton to name a few & the relaxed approach to police duty is done with a sly & dry comedic approach & there is nice chemistry between Murray & Driver but once the dead rise (because of a worldwide event) there's a few laughs but nothing special & it felt like the director wanted to be too smart & too cocky with his script that the ""SCRIPT"" actually gets mentioned by itself main two characters (Murray & Driver) in a terribly un-funny Meta-comedy scene & it ruins the film. Murray & Driver are a good team but deserved a better movie. The ""Dead"" is a very slow movie & it does get boring at times but Murray is always interesting on screen even if this is the most relaxed I've ever seen him on screen but he's the watchable one of the movie. I did feel that it would be easy to fall asleep watching this & waiting for something to happen but it's forgiven because it's supposed to be played out like this for it's Sleepy little town atmosphere & setting. But for a Comedy Horror it really isn't funny except for a few bits sprinkled throughout but definitely not a big laugh movie at all. The Horror aspect is of course comical zombies like every other comedy zombie flick but the gore is done well but all the elements just don't click together in my opinion.Another ridiculous scene is where Tilda Swinton's weird Scottish samurai gets beamed up to an spaceship? Like a scene from another movie altogether & it didn't work here but i see that the director was trying to create a ""Cult"" film like the Cult Classic NIGHT OF THE CREEPS (1986) but he definitely did not pull it off with his ""Dead"" film.Also to top it all off after the very long build-up to the actual zombie invasion with get a few gory bits & before you know it the film reaches a totally unsatisfactory end!!!A big shame because this film could've been so Awesome with a cast like that.",The Dead Don't Die
47,Pairic,Funny in parts but not great,6,17 July 2019,"The Dead Don't Die: An all star cast, a great director/writer but it just doesn't hang together. Pacing is off, when police chief Cliff (Bill Murray) trips into a grave it should be funny but isn't. The film would have benefitted from a 15 minutes cut to the running time. Some sequences are unrelated to the rest of the movie, the large Juvenile Detention Centre is incongruous in a small town, I realise it's meant as social commentary but it doesn't work. Far more effective is Farmer Miller (Steve Buscemi) who wears a Make America White Again cap and complains about coffee being too black. Tom Waits excels as Hermit Bob who notices that something strange is going on as animals hide. The Fourth Wall disappears early on as Officer Ronnie (Adam Driver) tells Cliff that the song The Dead Don't Die sounds familiar as it's the theme song. Iggy Pop is great as a zombie who attacks a diner, eating the owner, munching on intestines and drinking coffee. Tilda plays the enigmatic Scottish undertaker who is also a Ninja and nifty at beheading zombies with her Samurai sword. Oh, the whole thing is due to Polar Fracking, the Earth's wobble on it's Axis has been changed. Jarmusch has delivered better. 6/10.",The Dead Don't Die

49,peterp-450-298716,Not exactly horror but they used my kind of humor.,7,18 September 2019,"This isn't gonna end well.Life is full of surprises. First of all, the location where I saw this film. I thought it was a unique experience. I watched ""The dead don't die"" outdoors in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. And yes, this is something I don't do too often. To be honest it's the second time that I watch a film under a starry sky. The first time, however, I guess the budget was a slight problem. The screen wasn't exactly resistant to the wind. The result was that in ""Racer and the Jailbird"", Matthias Schoenaerts looked unwillingly comical every time the wind rose. In Ljubljana, however, in addition to the perfect location namely Ljubljanski Grad (The Castle of Ljubljana), they also provided professional equipment. In short, a perfect image and sound (even with a gust of wind).Next, I was surprised by the film itself. I'm not a fan of a mixture of comedy and horror. But, I recently saw the movie ""Monster Party"". And I must say I also liked that movie. Perhaps I should, therefore, revise my opinion on this latest statement regarding humor and horror. Maybe it was also because of the type of humor that was used in ""The dead don't die"". Such a repetitive, bone-dry, absurd Monty Python-like humor. The kind of humor I'm a huge fan off. Already in the 80s, I watched TV shows such as ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"", ""The Young Ones"", ""Not the Nine O'Clock News"" and to a lesser extent ""The Muppet Show"". I'm sure there are people who don't appreciate the ""Theme song"" joke. And others will be bored when a third person makes the same remark about the possibility that some wild animal had something to do with the victims in a diner. Well, that's the humor I love.However, if you expect a purebred zombie movie, then the disappointment will be even greater. Because this flick won't scare you at all. Even the attempt to introduce some gore didn't really help. The reason why the dead left their graves en masse can be called original. Perhaps it's even a subtle environmental message for Governments. In any case, natural gas fracking causes incomprehensible phenomena to manifest themselves worldwide. For example, the movement of the earth appears to be disrupted, so the sunset is no longer correct (apparently it has something to do with the rotation of the earth). Pets and livestock suddenly disappear. And mobile phones and digital clocks no longer work. The behavior of the resurrected fellow human beings also deviates from the standard zombie behavior. This time no mindless non-living whose desire for blood and flesh is uncontrollable. No, these creatures stumble through the streets in search of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Xanax, and Snickers. Probably what occupied them just before they kicked the bucket.It's kind of normal and understandable to see actors such as Bill Murray and Steve Buscemi showing up in such an absurd horror-comedy. Bill Murray has such a natural appearance of a man who can't be profoundly disturbed and who apparently always reacts soberly to situations that make average persons hyperventilate. And Buscemi's appearance is extremely suitable for this kind of crazy movies. Bill Murray apparently also has a taste for zombie movies now. Hence his collaboration on the film ""Zombieland: Double Tap"".But I didn't expect actors such as Adam Driver (Jedi Kylo Ren in Star Wars) and Tilda Swinton (Mason from ""Snowpiercer"" and The Ancient One in ""Avengers: Endgame"") in this film. And yet they proved to fit perfectly one way or another. Adam Driver is a person with a neutral facial expression who looks at the situation in a relaxed manner. And Tilda Swinton took care of the most hilarious role as the mortician Zelda, who speaks with a Scottish accent and dangerously swings around with her Samurai sword just like Uma Thurman did in ""Kill Bill"". And last but not least you can admire the infamous Iggy Pop. The people from the make-up department didn't have much work on him, I guess.Although I had lots of fun watching this film, I had to conclude that the film didn't have a definite goal in mind. The whole is fairly frivolous and absurd. The denouement manages to surpass the absurdity in this film. I'm still surprised this was the opening film at the festival of Cannes. I think Jim Jarmusch had a very different target audience in mind. Certainly not an audience consisting of gentlemen in tuxedos and coquettish ladies dressed in evening dresses. I'm sure those who were there in Cannes will speak about ""The dead don't die"" for years to come. There's one person who benefits enormously from this grotesque film. And that is Sturgill Simpson whose song ""The dead don't die"" can be heard several times. Good for him.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",The Dead Don't Die

The humor worked for me, I thoroughly enjoyed myself and instantly regretted all the times I'd seen this sitting on store shelves and passed it over. That said, this is absolutely a movie that either clicks with you or doesn't and if it doesn't this is probably a pretty underwhelming slog to get through. For me it worked, with the only real negative being that it gets a little too fourth wall breaking and self referential near the end.

51,aidanratesmovies,"A boring, bland, and disappointing attempt at a great zombie comedy",4,2 July 2019,"Unfunny, boring, and simply uninspired, The Dead Don't Die feels less alive than its zombies within it. The film has some clever sparks throughout, but none that really seems to capture your eye or earn your attention. There's also some interesting plot points, but none seem to go anywhere important or have any point to begin with. Its performances are not terrible, and often feel appropriate for the feel of the film, but no one seems to be doing much of anything and therefore makes each character feel somewhat lazy if not lazily acted. The film is also slow, and though it may be so, it is certainly not average or predictable and oddly enough that what is makes the film the best. Tilda Swinton also provides a oddly amusing role, and is honestly the only shining light in this dim tale of boring and careless work.

As one watches you feel it plays out so slow as to kind of be a test of viewing fortitude. Even moreso one must arrive at the question how was this much talent persuaded to make this mess? There's some characters here that could have really been used to good effect, not with this story/screenplay however. If this movie finds an audience it must be a secret society with a select few members. All kidding aside it just never gets going and seems so totally boring as well as devoid of comedy.

54,jadepietro,Dead Heads,4,25 June 2019,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: There are no real laughs or real fun in this all-too-hip zombie flick which is dead on arrival.JIM'S REVIEW: The zombie comedy is fast becoming its own wild genre with horror fans who love that zany mix of laughs and gore. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Re-Animator, and Zombieland are only a few films that successfully blended those elements. The Dead Don't Die doesn't. Writer / Director Jim Jarmusch tries earnestly to reach that goal, but his hipster tendencies only disappoints. If only the wit were as sharp as its bloody blades.Mr. Jarmusch assembles his cast of established indie favorites and inserts these likable actors into small-town stereotypical roles. His screenplay starts out promisingly and establishes some wonderful atmospheric details to his fictional ""real nice"" town of Centerville, population 738, and its colorful residents. Before the outbreak of the undead begins, the film works. We meet law enforcement officers Cliff (a droll Bill Murray, is there any other kind? ), Ronnie (an all too low-keyed Adam Driver), and Mindy, (played by Chloë Sevigny as the nerdy deputy). The town-folks are a lovable bunch of misfits: Hermit Bob (Tom Wait) as the film's sage narrator, Farmer Frank (Steve Buscemi), a bigot complete with a trademark red Make America White Again hat who will obviously be a tasty dinner snack, good-natured ole Hank (Danny Grover), Zelda the Mortician (yet another oddity to add to Tilda Swinton's vast repertoire of quirky characters as she goes into Kill Bill mode). Alas, all soon will become human bait in this apocalyptic tale.In Mr. Jarmusch's vision, the world has been thrown off its axis, with polar fracking and global warming gone amok. Days are long and the nights are even longer. The world is off course, and so is this movie. This film shamelessly uses its liberal-minded thinking and attacks Middle America with its easy targetting of its dumb yokels. In fact, this whole venture may be the first eco-friendly unfriendly horror film that cares more about the Earth than its inhabitants.As the film progresses and the body count increases, the story gets even more bizarre, spinning off its own axis by abruptly breaking the fourth wall and making the plot become absurd beyond belief. This decision is a bold but major misstep by the filmmaker. The strangest thing about the movie is not the human vs. zombie munching, but the direct tongue-in-cheek references to reality: character discussions about the director, the film's song, the script, and the actors themselves are a glaring jolt from the seductive power of cinematic storytelling. This unnecessary u-turn takes the moviegoer completely out of the realm of fantasy and stops the film cold.The failure of this enterprise is Mr. Jarmusch's script, a repeat offender as it rehashes the plot and regurgitates whole portions of dialog which does little to advance the plot. The improvisational conversations strain credibility. Characters continuously drone on, "" This is gonna end badly!"" and "" Kill the head"", just in case no one gets the irony. The humor remains dead pan, but rarely delivers solid laughs, although an undead Carol Kane may be a funny enough sight gag for some moviegoers.Still, there are many nice directorial touches throughout as Mr. Jarmusch focuses on the country surroundings and local color. The many decapitations avoid the bloody gore factor with wisps of black smoke bellowing out of the zombie victims, although I could have had less of the bloody intestine chewing. The zombies themselves are quite ""inter""-resting (pardon the pun), with their sad expressions, skewed posture, and overall look achieved by fine costumes and subtle make-up effects. (Special mention goes to Frederick Elmes' strong photography and the original title track written and sung by Sturgill Simpson that could possibly become a country hit and possible Best Song Oscar nominee.)Yet all the visuals are ultimately undone by a story which is woefully underdeveloped and just plain dumb. It all leads to a very unsatisfying ending. The Dead Don't Die is a waste of everyone's talent and all of your time.",The Dead Don't Die
55,Rob_Taylor,The Walking Deadpan...,4,5 January 2020,"I can't help but think this movie was designed to be a commentary on small town American values and to poke a certain amount of fun at such people. However, all it really does is to say ""Small town America is full of morons"". The commentary, if that was the intent is lost in the rather unflattering portrayal of such a demographic.As a result, not only does the film feel dull and lifeless like the zombies themselves, but it also leaves a nasty taste in your mouth. It's as if the director wanted you to believe he was engaging in good-natured mockery when in fact, all the time he was harbouring a deep resentment towards the type of characters in this film.Whatever the original intent of this movie, the thing that it utterly fails to do is entertain. The movie plods along at a snail's pace with no variation from beginning to end. I was surprised when I looked at my watch and found only twenty minutes had passed.It doesn't help that many of the actors deliver their lines as is they were heavily sedated. No one looks surprised by anything, everyone seems numb to everything around them. Good job Jarmusch! Such cutting-edge commentary on our unfeeling society!Many of the actors give their woodenest performances to date. I mean, I'm used to Bill Murray phoning it in, but here even Driver doesn't rise above the level of an Ikea flat-pack shelf unit.As for the comedy, well... I suppose there are a few moments. And when I say moments, I mean fractions of a second. I think the only thing that made me smile was Iggy Pop as a zombie and I'm not sure if that counts as type-casting or not, since he already looks like one.Beyond that, the humour is very forced and often relies (far too much) on repetition. ""This will end badly"" is repeated by Driver ad nauseum. At the scene of a zombie attack, three people arrive one after the other, look at the bodies and then wonder aloud if an animal or ""several animals"" did it. The same scene, repeated three times. That isn't funny, it's just sad padding. The ""Dead Don't Die"" song is played repeatedly until you are sick of it.I guess the thought was that if you repeat something unfunny enough times it eventually becomes funny? But it doesn't, Jim. It just increasingly grates on your nerves and looks like you are not trying.I suspect Jarmusch missed the memo that deadpan humour still has to be funny for it to work.All in all there is nothing here for zombie fans. Nothing for comedy fans and nothing for those who want a half-decent drama. Only fans of Jarmusch need apply and even then, I feel like they are in for a disappointment.SUMMARY: Dull and lifeless. Actors on Mogadon. Over-reliance on repetition as a form of humour (which doesn't work). No real plot. Bad writing. Caricatures, rather than characters.

(R)Indie cinema titan Jarmusch takes on the ""zom-com"" sub-genre with mixed results. (Un)deadpan humor dominates an outbreak of flesh-eating zombies in the small town of Centerville (likely the whole world as well, since it is supposedly being caused by a shift of Earth's axis); little effort is made to deliver scares, and social commentary is largely borrowed from the George Romero playbook. Large ensemble cast--perhaps too large, considering how some sub-plots feel entirely inessential (the juvie hall scenes don't connect and go nowhere)--but most are up to the task; standouts include Driver as a deputy who seems to know a little too much about what's going on, and Swinton as a Scottish, samurai sword-wielding undertaker. Filled with meta-jokes (favorite: RZA in a bit part as a parcel delivery driver for WU.P.S.), perhaps none more meta (unintentionally?) than having the film's pace match that of the shambling ghouls.

59,arungeorge13,A middling zom-com that struggles to maintain its initial intrigue! [+51%],5,15 May 2020,"Jim Jarmusch fiddles with a concept that's as old as George Romero's Night of the Living Dead and doesn't really get anywhere with it. The titular song by Sturgill Simpson is played a countless number of times in the movie that it's more like a rotten Easter egg, painfully driving the point home over and over again. The film does begin on an amusing note. It tries to tell viewers through various characters, t.v and radio updates that something's gone wrong with the world. At the forefront of the long list of characters is the cop duo of Cliff and Ronnie, played by Bill Murray and Adam Driver respectively, often accompanied by Mindy (Chloë Sevigny).It only takes about 35 minutes for Ronnie to conclude that the undead has risen and wants to feed on the living. I laughed out loud the first time I heard a couple of zombies say ""Coffee!"" and looked all cheery about getting some at a diner. But then, it becomes a (rather stiff) running joke when every other zombie starts muttering words like Xanax, Snickers, Siri, and Wi-Fi. Fans of zombie movies also wouldn't enjoy excessive spoonfeeding. Two or more characters often unnecessarily explain a plot-point (like, to always go for the head to render a zombie motionless) just so that everyone's on the same page.While we've seen Bill Murray in a funnier, more engaging zombie film (i.e. 2010's Zombieland), it was refreshing to see Adam Driver take up something so vastly different from his previous outings. The same goes for Tilda Swinton; her British sense of humor really helps enliven a few scenes - such as the one at the funeral home where she's readying a couple of dead bodies for burial. There's also a brilliantly written (meta) sequence at the end, featuring Cliff and Ronnie stuck in the cop car surrounded by a swarm of zombies.There are cameos - lots of 'em! You'll come across Caleb Landry Jones, Danny Glover, Steve Buscemi, RZA, Rosie Perez, Iggy Pop, Selena Gomez, and even Sturgill Simpson himself. Tom Waits plays Hermit Bob - the know-it-all who calmly watches all the action unfurl from a distance and offers gratuitous social commentary.

The end.This film has a great cast, a very great cast in fact - Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Steve Buscemi, Tom Waits, Adam Driver, Chloe Sevigny, Rosie Perez, Carol Kane, Tilda Swinton, Iggy Pop, RZA, Selena Gomez.... how the heck did they agree to this film???The problem I found was not the already been done story, nor action or effects, the problem I found was a lazy script and poorly executed plot. It almost felt like something a bored college kid could turn out for mid-semester project - I know because I tried to pass something similar off and my professors basically closed the door in my face!Examples of a lazy script....Lazy repetition of dialogue for comedy affect works once, maybe sometimes it works twice, but three times??? No, then it's just stupid.Lazy repetition of dialogue for comedy affect works once, maybe sometimes it works twice, but three times??? No, then it's just stupid.Lazy repetition of dialogue for comedy affect works once, maybe sometimes it works twice, but three times??? No, then it's just stupid. Get the point?Adam Driver asks Bill Murray ""Do we need all this hardware?"" as they walk into the police station at the start of a scene. This despite the fact that they were both off camera getting it - surely this is a point that would have been asked while getting it instead of waiting for the audience to hear it on their return to shot.""Kill the Head"". A line which is muttered by different groups of people in the film, who haven't discussed this line with anybody previously. It's just passed from person to person in the lazy script.Why do zombie's have phones? Why do they have any battery at all if they have been buried with the phones. How are their phones actually working if nobody else in the entire movie has a working phone? Lazy. I get the feeling this was a commentary on how modern culture are zombies to their phones the way people walk with their heads down staring at a mobile device instead of what's in front of them. This commentary has been done in other films, and it was done better. Why it was included here is a mystery, it served no purpose.Who buries the dead in sports equipment? I ask that seriously as some of the zombies appeared in semi-decomposing sporting attire - football helmets, baseball equipment... why, and why?What was even the point of the hipsters? They didn't drive the story, they served no purpose. Was it just to have them killed off? Pointless.On a similar note, what was the point of the escaped kids from juvenile detention - they also didn't do anything to further the film. Pointless addition.The whole ""I read the script"" dialogue between Driver and Murray. I laughed the first time this 3rd person awareness conversation was done - Driver telling Murray he recognised the ""Dead don't die"" song as the theme tune for the movie. To repeat this same joke at the end of the film was just plain lazy. It was like an attempt at doing some tongue-in-cheek ""Airplane"" style humour, which fell flat on it's bum.The nod to Star Wars when Adam Driver hands his car keys to Tilda Swinton - what was the point? Was it just to say to the audience ""this is where you recognise him from"". If so, why did Murray not have a Ghostbusters keyring, or Steve Bescemi have sunglasses and a black suit on?? What was the point.Why have the mild racism in the film if there was no education about anti-racism in it? Glover's character could easy have educated Buscemi's character. Instead it was just left ignored, much like racism has been ignored before - not cool.I've got to stop asking questions and pulling this apart now.... sorry.From the beginning of the film it was obvious to me who would survive, what had happened to the chicken, and who would die. The only thing that surprised me slightly was the way Tilda Swinton's character exited the film - but by that point I had stopped caring anymore and just wanted the film to end. It was obvious there was something not right about her, but I didn't see that coming... but I also felt that this contributed to the laziness of the film.All in all, the best I can say about this film is that on paper it looks like a really good film with a great cast - in reality I wouldn't recommend people to watch it. This film has really pi55ed me off, I didn't want to get angry and give it a bad score, but the more I think about this film and how it left me feeling.......For anybody that thinks I should have known what to expect from a Jim Jarmusch film then sorry. I do understand that this was probably an attempt to commentate on the audience. Showing that we are all zombies with an expectation that is addicted a certain style of film and delivery. This film certainly does trash expectation (especially from the great promo for it) with a poor delivery, plot holes, undeveloped arcs, moments of real boredom, repetitive and lazy scripting. Personally though, I watch films for suspension of disbelief - this film didn't deliver for me. Maybe it's just me, maybe I don't get it and I'm out of touch. Maybe in years to come this will be a cult classic. P.S. Feel free to hate me or mark this review as unhelpful - I've stopped caring after revisiting this film in my head for the review.⭐⭐ (2/10)",The Dead Don't Die

It ends up being boring.And so, you think all those characters at least are going to be really important and all relevant, but no. Those are basically a waste of time.After that waste of time, things start to happen, but the movie manages to still feel painfully slow, the jokes are too subtle and don't land anyway, and the whole thing turns out to be a mess of a satire.

66,rockman182,The Dead Don't Die (2019),6,16 June 2019,"The trailer for this had me in stitches. A comedic zombie genre film with Adam Driver and Bill Murray delivering deadpan humor. Not to mention Tilda Swinton as a blade wielding woman with a hilarious accent. The idea of Jim Jarmusch penning the script for a zombie film was just something was just brilliant. Zombies... you know...ghouls. I'd say the film is mixed because of some plot points and pacing but it made me laugh out loud a few times.This film is about a small town during a zombie uprising, caused by polar fracking and the tilting of the Earth's axis. Yes, go figure how that works, I guess. The two main police officers respond to the call and must figure out how to stop the impending zombie attacks. The film is directed by Jim Jarmusch and mainly stars Adam Driver, Bill Murray, and Chloe Sevigny. There is a highly talented supporting cast at Jarmusch's helm for this one with usual favorites like Iggy Pop mixed in.The film moves at a snails pace at times which can be a little frustrating but is also the time to give screen time to its many many characters. Some of the side characters are more interesting than others. Not all the comedic moments but when they do its really funny. I absolutely loved the delivery and connection between Murray, Driver, and Sevigny. Tilda Swinton and her accent oh my god best thing ever. This is a semi bloody film but mostly dusty (you'll get this when you see it). Its still a sharp film but doesn't always thrill.I was fairly irritated near the end with a certain reveal with the script followed by another crazy reveal. Felt like both were too out there and takes you out of the realm of what is established over an hour and a half. Still, you can tell Jarmusch and the cast had a lot of fun with this film. I can appreciate comedic spins on the tired zombie genre because what I've seen so far worked well. It doesn't always blow you away but its a nifty little time killer.6.5/10",The Dead Don't Die

69,spookyrat1,What Was the Point?,5,16 August 2020,"After making the admittedly stylish, but arguably the slowest vampire movie of all time in Only Lovers Left Alive, Jim Jarmusch turns his hand to the zombie genre, with The Dead Don't Die, ostensibly, a horror comedy. Few would disagree that over the last couple of decades, zombies have really got a thorough work over in both the cinema and on television. So you would think a reputable film maker such as Jarmusch, would attempt to do something completely different with the undead concept. Well he does and he doesn't. He gives us a semi-plotless , extremely quirky, meandering work, that again dusts off some of the same thematic elements of the earlier vampire film. Namely, that humans have just about run their race on the planet and that may be it's time for a clear out and the establishment of a new New World Order. Whether that be vampire or alien - influenced is unclear.The plot (as it is) can be described in two sentences. In a languidly unhurried fashion, The Dead Don't Die outlines the gradual over-running of the small town of Centerville, by resurrected zombies. It is inferred the zombies have risen due to side effects of the Earth, being mysteriously tilted off its axis.The main attraction of the film is the very long list of celebrity actors, who line up to be on the zombie smorgasbord. Bill Murray and Adam Driver are amusing initially, until they become boring, both playing deliberately phlegmatically stoic, unemotional cops, sort of leading the defence of the town. What they lack in emotional personality is more than made up by their whiney partner, Mindy Morrison played by Chloë Sevigny, whose negativity, becomes incredibly tiresome and repetitive by the film's second half. Tilda Swanton is the most humorous character, playing Scottish mortician, the enigmatic Zelda Winston, who's obviously been paying a lot of attention to The Walking Dead's katana-wielding Michonne.It is fun watching the host of other actors filling smaller roles, but the film suffers greatly from the lack of a cohesive narrative. It virtually parodies itself when Zelda asks Murray's Chief of Police what the battle plan is and he can't answer. Instead he leaves Zelda in charge of the police station, whilst the 3 officers just drive around town in their squad car doing very little, until it bogs. Gripping stuff, it ain't. The third act plays out like an uneasy blend of Monty Python and The Alamo. Go figure. It tries to be funny, but in truth it's pretty dispiriting, as if Jarmusch couldn't really be bothered.In terms of thrills, suspense and action any number of zombie films going right back to the classic Night of the Living Dead are far more appealing than TDDD. And if you're after laughs, Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland to name the obvious, are far cleverer and funnier. In truth Jarmusch really adds nothing to this well-worn genre. And the sad thing about it, is that it would seem that he doesn't really care.",The Dead Don't Die

Now this is a film review so why am I mentioning this?The USA under Trump has refused to sign up to the treaty to reduce the amount of gases causing the green house effect.This whole film is used to get the above message across, yes the whole film is a green political statement of if the USA continue to frack the Arctic circle this could have a drastic effect on the earth itself, for the purpose of this film making the dead come to life but in reality possibility causing death in the first place.The commentary at the end reinforced this by consumerism and wanting bigger and better being the driving force for the fracking, to power your Nintendo game boys.The acting is just half hearted, the reference to not reading the whole script was obviously aimed at certain members of Trumps administration, past and present.The UFO was just a lame attempt to either reinforce that we need to escape before the planet is killed for greed.Terrible lazy writing, terrible story, terrible acting and simply political or not avoid this film.Yes the facts are true and yes fracking may cause damage to our planet but this terrible film isn't the way to get the message across.Rating 2 out of 10",The Dead Don't Die

They start 4rthwalling, talking about the movie's script, making inside jokes that only they can laugh about and more.There were like 2 or 3 funny lines and some good atmospheric shots but the good stuff ends right there.

78,MrDHWong,Fails on almost every level at being an entertaining zombie film,3,21 November 2019,"The Dead Don't Die is a zombie comedy film written and directed by Jim Jarmush (Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, Broken Flowers). Starring Bill Murray and Adam Driver, it fails on almost every level at being an entertaining zombie film.In the quiet American town of Centerville, police officers Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) and Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) keep the peace among its low population. One night, the dead begin to rise from their graves as the alleged result of fracking the Earth's polar caps. With Centerville's residents quickly being devoured by the undead, Cliff and Ronnie work together to stop them before the whole town become zombies.In spite of its large cast and competent director, The Dead Don't Die may be one of the most boring, woefully underutilised films of the zombie genre in quite a while. Each time it seemed like there was something new happening, the film either resorts back to cliches or just gives up altogether. Some of this may be a stylistic choice on behalf of the writer/director, but it often becomes frustrating to anyone watching with hope that something interesting might happen.Apart from Bill Murray and Adam Driver, each other cast member were completely wasted. This is saying quite a bit, considering this film has the likes of Iggy Pop, Selena Gomez, Steve Buscemi, Tilda Swinton, and even Tom Waits playing a scruffy hermit at the forefront of the story. Any other actors could have played these roles and it only feels like they were cast as a marketing technique.Even though the film is promoted as a comedy, there are practically no laughs to be had. All the jokes fell flat and several actors have questionable comic timing, which certainly does not help the film in the long run. The only times where I at least smiled were during maybe one or two conversations between Bill Murray and Adam Driver. They weren't laughs by any means, but I at least felt some positive emotion towards something happening in the film, albeit fleeting. I actually wouldn't mind seeing Murray and Driver make another film together with each other, so long as it is better than this one.In conclusion, this film does not do the zombie genre justice in any way and only serves to prove that it is possibly becoming stale. There is so much squandered potential here that could have made for a fun, almost indie-style romp with zombies had it been better written. Rather, it may put audiences to sleep, dreaming that they were watching something else instead.I rate it 3/10",The Dead Don't Die

I may confess that I have a crush on zombies. 7) ...So, all the ingredients are lumped together but, it's quite strange and even weird, the recipe is rather unsuccessful: the atmosphere is sometimes cutesy or even insipid, the characters are usually devoid of enthusiasm and quite often apathetic, and the final scene rhymes with bitterness and bewilderment.Although the film is not completely lousy thanks to a few successful scenes, I was globally bored and disappointed.

84,PyroSikTh,"Slow, Meta, Few Actual Jokes; Not for Everyone",6,16 July 2019,"The premise is simple; a worldwide cataclysm has caused the dead to rise, except we see it all from the perspective of a small country town. But don't think this is Shaun of the Dead, because the tone is completely different. It's a very, very slow burn of a movie, to the point where it's almost boring. A lot of time is spent pinpointing the cast of characters; who they are, where they are etc. as well as building up the events leading to the zombie outbreak. The first hint is it still being daylight when it should be dark, watches stop ticking, phone's lose charge, the moon gets an ethereal purple glow around it. Numerous news reports go into polar fracking nudging the Earth's axis, heavily implied to be the cause of everything. The actual zombie portion of the film doesn't start until over half way through the running time.The comedy aspect is where most of this film's purpose lies though. Don't expect laugh-out-loud jokes though, because it's not that kind of comedy. At best the humour sits at a solid 'amusing', aiming instead for clever applications and self-referential lines than full-on jokes. The closest The Dead Don't Die gets to an actual joke is Adam Driver's character breaking the fourth wall a couple of times (which were honestly my favourite parts of the whole thing). Beyond that a lot of the comedy lies in the bizarre, the quirky, and the character dynamics, as well as more far-reaching humour in it's references and parodying.The whole movie is basically meant to poke fun at B-movie ripoffs. Sometimes it doesn't do quite a good enough job and ends up becoming a B-movie ripoff itself. Acknowledging how bad something is doesn't excuse it for being bad. For instance a couple of kids run off into the forest with one saying they know a good hiding place. So good in fact that they're never seen again, possibly in an attempt to poke fun at movies on such a strict budget that entire plotlines end up getting dropped halfway through filming, but they can't afford to lose what they've already filmed either. This isn't funny, it doesn't add anything to the film, it's just bad. Acknowledging that it's bad and saying ""hurr hurr that's the point"" isn't an excuse.Those kids end up being a pointless addition to the film (on purpose or otherwise, I'm not a fan of it), but they're not the only ones. Selena Gomez and her friends are equally as pointless. They're literally just there to drive around in the car featured in Night of the Living Dead, and that's it. But what makes their inclusion even worse is that their sub-plot doesn't even make any sense. The last time we see them they're watching a news report about people being attacked, float the idea that it could be zombies, and decide to lock the door in order to stay safe. Later they're found killed off-screen with the door wide open. As far as plot holes go, that's a pretty big one. Why would these clearly quite aware kids throw caution to the wind in the dead of night and let a zombie in to attack them? At the very least we needed to see that scene, because otherwise they're pointlessness is only amplified.With all that said, I did oddly enjoy myself. Deadpan humour isn't usually my cup of tea, and while I maintain that it was amusing at best, it was quite amusing. The fourth wall breaking was my highlight of course, but other great moments include Tilda Swinton's odd character and the bizarre twist at the end to reveal who she was, Steve Buscemi's ""Make America White Again"" hat, Tom Waits just walking around like a wise hermit monologuing, the zombies walking around groaning the things they liked when alive like ""Xanax"" ""Tools"" ""Candy"" ""Wi-fi"". I also particularly liked the zombie deaths. Instead of there being a spray of gore, it's just black dust. I mean they're dead, they don't have any blood left in their bodies, why would they bleed?This movie isn't for everyone. It's slow and boring, unfocussed, weird and quirky, homaging movies barely anyone (myself included) have even seen. But it does have its own bizarre charm. It's the kind of movie you put on to laugh at rather than with (but end up laughing with, because it wants to be laughed at, I guess?). Either way, I didn't love it, but it was a fine enough way to spend the morning. 6/10.",The Dead Don't Die
85,sweidman-28016,An Average Dumb Comedy,6,6 July 2019,"The Dead Don't Die Review:The Dead Don't Die follows the peaceful town of Centerville as if finds itself battling a zombie horde as the dead start rising from their graves. This is written and directed by Jim Jarmusch and stars many people. To name a few there's Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, and Chloë Sevigny. I didn't know what to expect from this. I personally haven't seen a Jim Jarmusch film, and I know they're supposed to be amazing, but this one did not get very good reviews. I can see why many wouldn't like this movie. Comedies usually either do very well or just go horribly. I personally had some fun with this horror-comedy. The premise of the movie is supposed to be dumb which I got. It actually was kind of dumb, though. The plot wasn't the most interesting thing every. It was very typical, which it's supposed to be, but there wasn't too much originality from it. The whole story could be mostly guessed straight from the beginning. It was slow for a comedy. Nothing really happens for a good 45 minutes. The runtime definitely could've been cut down with lots of the random stuff and side plots. There's a side story with these children and it wasn't relevant to the story. If it was taken out there wouldn't be a huge change to the story. Most of the side plots are just for comedy, though, which the comedy kept it going for me. It's a lot of dumb, weird humor, similar to a Wes Anderson film, and I like that kind of comedy. The hilarity comes best with Bill Murray and Adam Driver. I thought they did a fine job and were a great duo. Adam Driver had many funny one-liners that I thought were hilarious. Lots of the same jokes and humor are repeated multiple times throughout the movie. Repetition makes things funny for me at least. There's not a whole lot to say about this movie. I thought it was funny but dumb. Many people didn't like it which I definitely understand. I thought it was fine. Definitely not a must see or anything.My Grade: B-",The Dead Don't Die

Bill Murray, Adam Diver, Tilda Swindon, Danny Glover, Steve Buscemi ... a stacked cast but with a god awful execution.Everything was just so slow, which I always think is absolutely reprehensible in a zombie film. Trailers exist, we know zombies are going to turn up, and that's why we've turned up to watch the movie! So why would you think about introducing the full on zombie element at the hour point? The opening hour was just so dull and pedestrian. I don't mind a bit of a set up if the characters are interesting and well explored, but they simply weren't in this film.When we did finally get down to the zombie action it was... meh. Far from exciting or scary.The film also made numerous attempts to be kooky which all missed the mark, for example Tilda Swinton's character. There were numerous plot points and characters that had absolutely zero need to be in the film, bringing literally nothing to the experience. It was really quite bizarre actually.The fourth wall breaks were entirely out of place and did not work at all.The only real saving grace of this film was the performances of Adam Driver and Bill Murray. It was quite a unique take on the whole zombie thing to have two characters act like it was another day at the office and seem unphased by it all. The film was at its strongest when this reaction was being explored, but it's not enough to make up for its numerous flaws.I love the zombie genre and was really looking forward to this, but it was a massive bust unfortunately.",The Dead Don't Die
89,namstonk,Classic Jim,9,2 September 2019,"If you want standard zombie then forget it. Yes it has the usual gore and funny deaths, but this has a liitle more care and gives character to the zombies. If you don't get satire then don't bother, this is sleek comedy with in-jokes to the actual actors, but kinda goes, 'well how the fook would you react to killing zombies you know'. Would you apologise or just say? There are plenty of lovely folks, but there is that gobby shithead from the pub who you'd make suffer. Oh happy days!!!",The Dead Don't Die
90,donaldricco,I KNEW polar fraking was bad!,6,28 September 2019,"This movie was so freaking weird! From Bill Murray's ""dead"" pan delivery of his lines, to the casual way that zombies were accepted by the townspeople, just plain weird. And for most of the film, I enjoyed it! The repetition of lines, like ""this is going to end badly"" and ""was it an animal? or several animals?"" to the constant playing of ""The Dead Don't Die"" song by Sturgill Simpson just made me laugh! As did the whole Cleveland hipsters part! I also chuckled at Adam Driver having a ""Star Wars"" keychain! And the acting of Caleb Landry Jones and Tilda Swinton was outstanding, and super, super strange!
The down, down side was the last 15 minutes or so. Just really dumb, and not dumb like some might think the rest of the movie is. Just a bad, bad ending. It went from a fun, quirky movie, to just insipid. If I ever re-watch this, and I may, I will definitely turn it off at about 1:26. Just like Jim should have.",The Dead Don't Die

93,ericrnolan,"A review of ""The Dead Don't Die"" (2019)",6,15 June 2019,"""The Dead Don't Die"" indeed has the greatest zombie cast ever assembled. Seriously, just look at that poster below. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the best zombie screenplay ever written, or the best direction ever seen in a zombie film. This would-be classic was a surprisingly average viewing experience; I'd rate it a 6 out of 10.I almost feel guilty for feeling so unenthusiastic, because I like so many of these actors so much. Bill Murray and Adam Driver actually are quite funny as the movie's two torpid police officers; Chloe Sevigny makes them even funnier as their panicked straight man. And the addition of Tilda Swinton's zany Scottish samurai undertaker makes them the perfect comedic quartet. (I think this is the first time I've seen Sevigny in a movie, as she mostly does arthouse films - including 2003's ignominiously reviled ""The Brown Bunny."" And I had no idea that Driver was this talented, given his milquetoast turn as a villain in the most recent spate of ""Star Wars"" films.) I honestly would love to see the four of these characters battle apocalyptic threats in a series of comedies - aliens, vampires, killer robots from the future ... whatever.Other big names shine here as well. Tom Waits and Caleb Landry Jones are both surprisingly funny, delivering little bouts of quirky, laconic, character-driven dialogue in a film that seems intended as mashup between ""Cannery Row"" (1982) and the first two ""Return of the Living Dead"" films (1985, 1988). (I first saw Jones as the creepy kid in 2010's ""The Last Exorcism;"" I suspect that more of my friends will recognize him as Banshee from 2011's ""X-Men: First Class."")The problem is this - although many of the characters are engaging, they populate a subdued, disconnected movie that is frequently quite slow. Writer-director Jim Jarmusch's heart is in the right place - assembling this oddball ensemble cast for the mashup I mentioned above is actually a terrific idea. But ""The Dead Don't Die"" ultimately lacks punch, and even a tongue-in-cheek horror-comedy needs a minimum of tension. The movie is a bit too lethargic to become the truly great film that the trailer led us to hope for.Complicating matters is the fact that that several groups of characters follow story arcs that go nowhere - sometimes literally. (Where did the kids from the juvenile detention center run off to? Why were they included at all? Not much happens to them and they have nothing to do with the rest of the movie.) This movie often felt like a number of comedy skits stitched together - some were admittedly quite funny, but they didn't add up to a cohesive story.Oh, well. It's possible that you will like ""The Dead Don't Die"" much more than I did. I might be the wrong audience for this, as I've never cared much for horror-comedies. (The aforementioned ""Return of the Living Dead"" films are on the short list of those that I like.) Your mileage may vary.",The Dead Don't Die
94,thomasjay-2201,A mess in the middle of the road,5,2 September 2019,"So before I set out I'd just like to note that personally I felt very little was good about this particular film and was a bit of a let down compared to what I saw from trailers etc. To begin with, the tone and rules of the zombies/ghouls/""monsters"" that are in a way the villains of the piece are wildly inconsistent, dashing from bland horror to comedy and then being fast and loose with the rules of its monsters which negates any and all horror that could've been. There's parts that are considered as postmodern but frankly they're so jarring and stick out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of the film and are aggressively pretentious which leads to a disengagement from the film and left me sitting bored, if not slightly annoyed. Packing in an odd commentary on consumerism as well as leaving so many questions regarding the fates of characters unanswered the point of this film seems missing. Overall there's not really much more to it than a roster of A listers from Bill Murray to Selena Gomez for you to play ""cameo bingo"" whilst watching along, total waste of time",The Dead Don't Die

96,backup-50362,It's almost impressively bad across the board,1,31 October 2021,"This was marked as ""comedy"" and ""horror"" on Netflix but it's neither.The acting is bad, the dialogue is ridiculously bad, the pacing is slow with tons of dead air and useless long scenes that add nothing... Doesn't even have an ending to its several parallel plot lines with different characters in em.And the characters are all stereotypical, comical one-dimensional cliches. I know some idiot will read this and be like ""but it's satire"" - well, it's a badly-made satire. Watch Deadpool - it's not amazing, but it's pretty funny and breaks the fourth wall the right way while keeping some semblance of a plot with real characters in it.But this... for a movie with some expensive actors and I guess some pop singers in it I really expected something... But wow.Lots of cringe and boredom. It's kind of on the level of low-budget scam movies like Birdemic. But at least that was so bad it was worth seeing for the novelty, plus you knew exactly what you were getting. But here you wait for anything good or funny and it never comes.But hey, I appreciate that someone can have enough money to make a bunch of quasi-celebrities star in absolute trash like this. And those US celebrities the rest of us don't care about will do it! They've read the script and did it anyways. They saw the movie and went out to promote it still! Talk about selling your soul.And I guess we could stretch to say that's the whole point of it.

97,jamiedarlow-37510,Really funny and bizarre zombie flick,6,7 April 2020,"Focusing on the town of Centerville, Chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray) and Officer Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) are on their usual patrol of their peaceful home. Daylight hours are becoming strangely unpredictable with scary reports on the news become a big cause for concern. This is all the beginning of the zombie apocalypse which we see through the eyes of sleepy townsfolk! This one is a mixed bag; when it's good it's absolutely brilliant and when it's not good, it's a bit awkward. The cast are top notch; Murray and Driver act off each other really well and make for a fun double act at the forefront. Chloe Sevigny is great as Officer Mindy Morrison; it's awesome to see her on the big screen again! Tilda Swinton is quite unlike anything I've seen her in before; her character of Zelda is hilarious and does provide the films biggest belly laugh I thought! The great Tom Waits is back as Hermit Bob and what a wonderful chance for Waits to work his magic again! Danny Glover is always great and Hank Thompson is a nice laid back character. Steve Buscemi as a racist farmer... that's all I need to say there! There's also two cool zombie cameos from Iggy Pop and Carol Kane who are both hilarious in this! As you can see, it's an all star cast and they all have a lot of fun on screen. The music is spookily great which really emphasises Jarmusch's intention to harken back to George A. Romero's work, in particular Dawn Of The Dead (1978) with its message on consumerism. The film does have one major flaw which come close to ruining it however; the fourth wall breaking scenes between Murray and Driver sounded funny on the page but doesn't translate well on screen and one moment towards the end where it becomes too self-indulgent. Other than that, it's well worth a watch for all indie and horror fans alike!",The Dead Don't Die
98,x_manicure_x,What were they thinking,4,14 August 2021,"Jim Jarmusch's anti-consumerist zombie comedy is not terrible but came in way too late. It has its moments, but it's still a big waste if we consider the superlative cast he could put together for this. I am sure they had a lot of fun filming it, but there is a huge difference between dry humor and half-assed comedy. The slow pacing is not a problem, if there only was something worth watching. Too many situations that lead to nothing, too many characters that didn't need to exist, too many pointless outcomes, too many obvious reflections. I see the metaphor of the world's balances changing and consumerism taking over the good old countryside, but that's all stuff we have seen for decades already.",The Dead Don't Die

Director:Jim jarmusch
starring: Bill Murray,Adam Driver,Tilda Swinton,Selena Gomez,Danny Glover,Austin Butler,Iggy pop etcoverall rating 16/100The dead dont die was embarrassingly bad i struggled to even find any positives it was that bad lets talk about why this film did not get hardly anything right.First of all the film was a complete an utter waste of some good actors who have done many other great acting performances before this film. Bill Murray and Adam driver were bland and boring there script was terrible and made them seem like dumb characters and poor actors when i know they are not. The acting was just so average from everyone and nothing exciting or entertaining happened with any actor or character within the film. The only half decent performances were from Tilda Swinton and Selena gomez. And one of the most annoying characters in the whole film was the female cop Mindy (Chloe Sevigny) she was so dumb and irratating and all she did was just stand around crying not knowing what to do i was glad she was taken by the zombies in the final act.Next the film had no plot or character development. The plot was dull and not explained leaving me bored. There was no creativity or uniqueness. There was no reasoning for characters actions or for a lot of the characters even being in the film especially the homeless person in the woods. The film lacked any form or foundations a film needs to even be half decent. They never explained the reasoning for the strange events or went deep into anything.Next the films humour was terrible and not funny at all. None of the jokes landed which made the film even more awkward to watch. It really made me cringe. The whole characters talking like the actors by saying read the script was a terrible idea and was executed horribly. I was laughing when it was not supposed to be funny which is never a good sign as the film could not be taken seriously at any point at all.Next the film had the most slowest pacing i think i have ever scene in any film. Who knew they could make a film with this genre so boring! most of the film was just characters talking and sitting around doing nothing. Nothing interesting was happening so even when there was some zombies that even bored me because they did hardly anything and was so slow it felt like the actors had to practically run into the zombies instead of actually being caught by them. I was almost tempted to just walk out.And finally the ending was absolutely terrible and made no sense whatsoever.
Nothing from the weak plot was resolved or developed they randomly had Tilda Swintons character get taken away by aliens which made no sense whatsoever. They had all the characters die which was another terrible way to end the film. They really should not of allowed this film to be released in theatres.If i can find any positives it would be the character designs for the zombies were fairly cool,the gore was entertaining in places and they did some interesting and unique stuff with Tilda Swintons character despite not being executed in the best way.overall the dead dont die is an embarrassment of a film and will not give the director of this much work after this due to him not even being able to have the simple structure a film needs to be passable.",The Dead Don't Die

A part of me believes that Jim would rather be ""Hermit Bob"" than himself.The dialogue tone was ""Fargo like"" with most characters talking monotone knowing how ridiculous the situation they happen to be in.It was entertaining clear message that we all continue to ignore by prioritising a superficial lifestyle (referenced back to the 1920s Great Gatsby's wife).And it's a sad truth...look at some of the Titans of finance one is nearly 93 and he's still going at it.

118,Bertaut,"Very funny, very peculiar, somewhat didactic",7,29 July 2019,"Who could have predicted that celebrated indie writer/director Jim Jarmusch would have any interest in making an ensemble zombie comedy? He has certainly made genre films in the past - Down by Law (1986) is a prison break film, Dead Man (1995) is a western, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai (1999) is a samurai film, Only Lovers Left Alive (2013) is about vampires - and usually, he's very successful at grafting his worldview onto the generic tropes, with the resultant films undeniably genre pieces, but undeniably Jim Jarmusch films. With The Dead Don't Die, however, he's not quite as successful; this is very much a Jarmusch film before it's a zombie movie, and it's not hard to see why it has met with mixed responses from critics and audiences - glib socio-political commentary is introduced without really going anywhere; heavily promoted performers have nothing more than one or two-scene cameos; some of the characters know they're in a movie whilst others do not; a lot of the humour is of the flippant self-congratulatory kind; things become very preachy towards the end as Jarmusch abandons all semblance of narrative progression and shifts gears into a pseudo-TED talk.However, for all that, I enjoyed it. A zombie apocalypse movie set very much in Trump's America, it embraces all the weirdness that such a scenario suggests. And for me, the awkward humour works well for the most part and the meta elements are intriguing but not too distracting. As for the didacticism, well, nothing that Jarmusch says is incorrect; we are a culture ruled by materialism and we are sticking our collective heads in the sand regarding the fact that we're destroying the only home we have. So it might be inelegant, but it's not wrong.Set in the fictional town of Centerville (pop. 738), strange things are afoot. Despite it being 8pm, the sun is still shining, people's watches have stopped, no one can get any signal on their phone, and the news is full of reports on the recent ""polar fracking"", which some believe has knocked the earth off its axis. As the sun finally sets on Centerville, two zombies (Sara Driver and Iggy Pop) rise from the grave and set out in pursuit of the one thing all zombies crave...coffee. Very much an ensemble piece, we meet a litany of Centerville residents - police chief Cliff Robertson (Bill Murray); deputies Ronnie Peterson (Adam Driver) and Mindy Morrison (Chloë Sevigny); a newly arrived undertaker, Zelda Winston (Tilda Swinton); farmer Frank Miller (Steve Buscemi); vagrant Hermit Bob (Tom Waits); hardware store owner Hank Thompson (Danny Glover); gas station owner Bobby Wiggins (Caleb Landry Jones); delivery man Dean (RZA); recently deceased town drunk Mallory O'Brien (Carol Kane); motel owner Danny Perkins (Larry Fessenden); journalist Posie Juarez (Rosie Perez); waitress Fern (Eszter Balint); detainees at a juvenile detention facility Stella (Maya Delmont), Olivia (Taliyah Whitaker), and Geronimo (Jahi Di'Allo Winston); cleaner Lily (Rosal Colon); and out-of-towners Zoe (Selena Gomez), Jack (Austin Butler) and Zack (Luka Sabbat).If The Dead Don't Die has a single salient theme, it's apathy, suggesting that humanity is sleepwalking its way towards its own extinction. The zombie apocalypse is initially depicted as slow and distant, not something about which to be overly concerned, until suddenly there's no escape. In this sense, Jarmusch uses zombies as double signifiers - they not only represent the apocalypse towards which we are moving, they also represent us, indifferently shuffling our way to an oblivion we know is coming, but which we choose to ignore (at one point, Cliff literally falls into an open grave because he isn't looking where he's going). The film does provide a narrative explanation for why the dead are rising from the grave (the oft-discussed polar fracking), but really, Jarmusch isn't as interested in the ""why"" as he is in the ""how"", castigating a moribund and materialist society which has become blind to everything but trivial consumerist gratification.In short, Jarmusch is suggesting that as a society, we've become zombified; lazy, instinctual, addicted to things that don't matter (whilst the first zombies we meet want coffee, others are on the hunt for WiFi, Siri, Chardonnay, Xanax, and ""Fashion""). Indeed, in this sense, one of the film's more subtle (and interesting) points is that the best way to remain outside such societal calcification is to remain on the edges of the social contract - the characters who do best against the zombies are the socially ostracised Zelda, the three kids in the detention facility, and the philosophical Hermit Bob. Indeed, the vast majority of characters respond to the zombies in a blasé manner, suggesting that in these insane times, when so many people are falling all over themselves to normalise the rantings of the racist, misogynistic, incoherent manchild in the Oval Office, even something like the dead rising from the ground is no big deal.Of course, using zombies as vehicles for social satire isn't exactly new; George A. Romero did it as far back as Night of the Living Dead (1968), which is more about endemic racism than zombies. He did it to even greater effect in Dawn of the Dead (1978), where he targeted materialistic vapidity. Later, he looked at issues such as Reagan-era militarism in Day of the Dead (1985), economic disparity in Land of the Dead (2005), media impartiality in Diary of the Dead (2007), and tribalism in Survival of the Dead (2009). In this tradition, The Dead Don't Die has its eye very much on the climate change-denying administration in Washington; Frank is introduced wearing a MAGA-style baseball cap with a ""Keep America White Again"" logo, whilst his dog is called Rumsfeld. Indeed, Centerville itself is very much a quintessential Heartland town, the kind where Trump so successfully mobilised his blue collar base. And whilst it remains a comedy, much of what The Dead Don't Die says is deadly serious - the planet is dying; the polar ice caps are melting, and with them, the future of our species; universal scientific guarantees of impending extinction are largely ignored, whilst the idiots in power discard the warnings of their own people, strip away environmental protections, and continually confuse weather and climate.One element of the film that's especially interesting is the Pirandellian self-reflexivity, with some of the characters aware that they're in a movie, but the rest seemingly oblivious. For example, when Sturgill Simpson's ""The Dead Don't Die"" begins playing on the radio in Cliff and Ronnie's car, Cliff asks why the song sounds so familiar, and Ronnie explains that it's probably because ""it's the theme song"". Later, after Ronnie has declared about a million times that ""this isn't going to end well"", an exasperated Cliff asks him how he can be so certain, and Ronnie says it's because he's read the script. This upsets Cliff because he was only allowed to read the scenes in which he appeared. A few minutes later, when something especially bizarre happens with Zelda, an incredulous Cliff asks Ronnie ""was that in the script?"" And the point of all this self-reflexivity? If I was to guess, I'd say that Jarmusch is using it in the Brechtian sense to ensure the audience remains consciously critical, more engaged with the narrative on an intellectual level than an emotional level.For all its positives, however, the film does have some problems. For one thing, the last ten minutes or so will irritate a lot of people, as Jarmusch abandons all semblance of narrative, and gives us a scene over which Hermit Bob delivers a dire assessment of who we are as a species. It's very preachy and it's very didactic. Another issue is the humour, which is best described as Jarmuschian - all awkward stilted dialogue, deadpan one-liners, people repeating things other people have said, and subtle winking at the audience. It definitely isn't the kind of broad stroke humour one finds in zombie comedies, such as Shaun of the Dead (2004) or Zombieland (2009). Some of the political themes are also underexplored. For example, Frank's MAGA hat is a pointed critique of Trump and those who blindly vote for him and excuse his behaviour, but to what end? The trio of kids from the detention centre are also introduced as if they will be major players, but they're gradually forgotten about, and ultimately don't play much of a role in the story. Also, as Jarmusch himself is well aware, the film isn't really saying anything that Romero hasn't already said.Nevertheless, I enjoyed The Dead Don't Die. It's certainly nowhere near Jarmusch's best, and I can understand people who dislike it; a lot of the themes have been explored before, a lot of the jokes have been made before, and it's neither a terrifying thriller nor a self-conscious meta-comedy. Having said that, however, the socio-political commentary is undeniably relevant and the cast is universally impressive. And ultimately, you may have a problem with the manner with which the film communicates its message, but that doesn't alter the fact that that message is absolutely legitimate.",The Dead Don't Die
119,Lewis_Heather787,Not you're average zombie flick!!,8,30 May 2019,"Either you buy right into this film or you just don't. This film is very strange right from the beginning and only gets more weird as the film goes on. This is definitely not you're everyday zombie film like Zombieland or World War Z, just the top of my head, it is a much more slow and methodical film about characters and their interactions.
Don't get me wrong there are some great laughs in this film and maybe just a little bit of zombie killing to.Jim Jarmusch has written and directed a zombie film that is absolutely bonkers not just as a zombie flick but as a film. The dialogue in this film and direction that he has given the actors, especially Bill Murray and Adam Driver, is just so strange. It is delivered in a way that makes everything they same seem so normal like water is wet. Even when the zombie killings start happening it is brought up so casually......I cant quite put it into words. I can definitely see this being one of the points as to why audiences may not latch onto this film because you're either going to go along with it or be completely disconnected from the film. I am happy to say that I'm the former in that scenario. Jarmusch has definitely given us something original, new and fresh in terms of the zombie genre in film. Its a welcome change personally.The cast of this film is stupidly good and unsurprisingly all of them deliver. The two biggest standouts are Bill Murray and Adam Driver who are both great in their respective roles and are involved in some very funny scenes. Both characters are very likeable and you go along with them in this journey as cops in this some village, along with Chole Sevigny who is also good. Other shoutouts should go to Tom Waits who is just so creepy and is just made for that role. Tilda Swinton, Danny Glover, Steve Buscemi and Caleb Landry Jones are also all really good.oh yeah......small shoutout for Selena Gomez she was good in a small role.The last positive I have is to do with the writing of the humour and the deeper meaning behind some of the film. Firstly the humour is not overused in this film but when it is used it is done perfectly, there really are some laugh out loud moments. Moments such as the zombies carrying around phones looking for wi-fi.........genius gag. Adam Driver's character's car keys has a Star Wars Star Destroyer key fob on it...........a on the nose hint at Drivers involvement in the franchise......again really funny. There is another side to the humour that is linked to the other point about the hinting at deeper meanings behind the film. The film does hint at two main topics environmental and political. Such as the polar fracking causing the zombie apocalypse, its batted over you're head but its used cleverly and not over the top. Just like Steve Buscemi's character wearing a particular hat with a bit of a twist or his dog's name being Rumsfeld. Or Adams Driver's character commenting on Selena Gomez characters country of birth. These hints in the humour I like a lot, it puts the point across but also makes you laugh.But the biggest laugh has to be conversation between Bill Murray and Adam Driver towards the end of the film. When Adam Driver said that he read the script I completely lost it.. it just worked so well for me personally. If that didn't make you laugh then you probably didn't like this film that much.Overall it 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, I thought it was very good. It was everything I wanted it to be and a little more, a new fresh take on the cliche zombie film that was really enjoyable. However this is not for everyone so I completely understand if you were bored throughout, fortunately for me I wasn't.
I did have a couple of problems though, the film is a little to slow in some parts it can get a bit stagnant. The other is I would have like to seen more of some other characters like Danny Glover, Caleb Landry Jones......also Selena Gomez and her two friends, they all sort of popped up and then got eaten........would have like a bit more character development. Still all in all a really entertaining and bizarre watch that is an.........original film!!!!!!!!",The Dead Don't Die
120,donttouchmeprimate,Drinking toilet water...,4,15 September 2019,"...is disgusting. The earth is flat. Big foot is real.So, that was a bunch of random gibberish yes? Well so is this film. I was waiting to see this for several weeks and I finally had the chance to view it and, it's bad, it's just the opposite of a good time.I'm sure on paper this read like a clever, quirky film with deep meanings on humans and the state of the modern world, about how we're already zombies to our addictions and being materialistic, now I know this to be true because the film LITERALLY tells us this half way through the non-story, and then it repeats this again several times and once more at the end in case you didn't get it.There's no real structure to the plot, characters are introduced and built up to invest the audience, only to have no point or effect on the plot whatsoever from then.There's some ""4th wall breaking"" that was executed very sloppily and came across like a lame dad-joke.You can actually see what the creators wanted this film to be, they just didn't have a clue on how to make it happen.And the cast? A-list actors and a few cameos from other famous faces were generally doing a good job and stuck to their characters, although Bill Murray did seem like his lost interest half way through and started to phone it in.Now, I would like to give a more in-depth and interesting review but I need to go and poo now, and that is more important that this movie.

Bill Murray and Adam Driver seemed like a great duo but they didn't bring anything unique to their characters. Heck, they along with the rest of cast didn't seem all that invested. Very bland performances. On the bright side, the makeup and practical effects were a nice ode to classic zombie films but there's also some questionable CGI that tainted it.

The Tom Waits and Tilda Swinton characters and subplots were annoyingly and confusingly incomplete, rambling and pointless. Chloe Sevigny's character was bizarrely cliched and outdated - was this supposed to be a joke or just really lazy writing? The moments of self awareness, such as commenting about the ""theme song"", were not funny or smart and added a sense of pretentiousness. It's really weird that Jarmusch made this film & I don't know why he did. What was the USP? It didn't come across like it was a labour of love because he's a zombie film fan, it came across as though it was supposed to be a send up of zombie films but the jokes weren't frequent enough or funny enough and if anything it came across as if it is looking down its nose at such films and tropes and if that was the intention it's even more bizarre because then he's making a film about zombies to mock those who watch zombie films.

Swinton and Murray are wastes in this bad film. Where was the humour they promised. It is played straight throughout, deadpan .......which really gets old quickly. It's simply not funny. And Driver saying he's ""read the script"" !?!? I almost turned inside out I was so embarrassed for them.......they seriously thought that crap was funny?!?
In the right hands with a decent script (this was as clichéd as they come.......nothing new at all) they could have had a classic on their hands. ....but it just feels like a cheap cash in on zombie popularity and he obviously has some incriminating photos or something of the cast to get them involved. !?The pathetically weak attempt to have some kind of 'social commentary' with the lazy narration at the end was an insult to the viewers.Massive let down.

There are often scenes of silence and repetetive dialogues with silly jokes that are not funny at all. I find Bill Murray, the lead character, out of form. He is dull and unenthusiastic.However, what makes the movie interesting is the supporting cast. There are great names like Adam Driver (from Star Wars), Steve Buscemi (from Con Air, Reservoir Dogs and many others), Danny Glover (from Lethal Weapon series and others) and Tilda Swinton (from Snowpiercer). Thanks to their prominent acting skills, the movie becomes watchable. It has some references to George Romero and his movies like the scene in which a door is nailed shut.

129,RogerBorg,The only horror here is the waste of this stellar talent,2,22 June 2021,"A desperately try-hard flop trying to pitch itself as a post-modern so-bad-it's-good manufactured cult hit that misses in every way possible.The most impressive thing about it is that it's so consistently bad in every way. The premise tries to be deliberately ironic, but is accidentally moronic. The writing is appallingly weak, with no characterisation, and the film appears to be undirected, given the bemused, low energy performances from every cast member, and I mean every single one. Even the versatile Tilda Swinton is a wreck here, putting on a shoddy Scotch accent quite likely just because she was bored with the whole thing.The pacing is shuffling and plodding, taking a solid hour to get going. Scenes jump around from one character or group to the next without rhyme or reason or connection. There are no action scenes as such, no peril, and it's devoid of wit and humor, except perhaps in some comically lazy effects.Nobody has any idea what tone they were going for. It's not a pastiche or parody, it's not a comedy, it's not a horror, or a thriller and it's certainly not a character piece. The cast just mumble their lines in a low energy way, clearly hoping that someone else will be credited as the lead. The lucky ones die off screen, with no explanation or reason for it, while some simply lose the will to live, and who can blame them.The sets are basic and under-dressed, the cinematography is mediocre and keeps to tight shots to hide the lack of even a TV budget, and the score is a sparse, anaemic dirge that may or may not be attempting to echo genre classics. It's just impossible to tell, so unsure is this movie about itself.Some embarrassed looking extras and cameos in shoddy zombie makeup turn up half way through and sway back and forth, and that's your film. There are two ""clever"" ""twists"", one so telegraphed and over-sold that it's sheer cringe, the other such a cop-out disjoint that I yelled ""Oh, sod off, movie"" and (virtually) walked out with ten minutes to go.Why this was made is a mystery. Nobody involved seems to be the slightest bit interested in what they're doing, on either side of the camera.

The plot is like any other zombie movie. Shows location, introduces characters and boom zombies come up and.. wait, nothing happens? Yes unfortunately what the heck was the director smoking... I absolutely was glued the first half of the movie. I loved the quirky characters and the scenery, it felt slow but inclusive like a tarintino movie. But unfortunately after the half way mark nothing happens and the plot goes nowhere, the characters get boring, do random clueless things, break the forth wall. And the ending was absolutely terrible!Acting:
The cast is amazing, the acting is quirky and interesting the first half of the film. But then it slowly dies along with the plot.Cinematography:
Very interesting and meaningful shots and CGI. It seems like it was highly inspired by classic films, which is a good thing.Conclusion:
This film could have been really awesome. The plot 100% needed to change and more things/problems needed to be had and solved. None of this slow building intense for a stale lack luster end.

The director/writer threw everything possible at this movie and i think sometimes it just doesn't work.The metaphor that is used is very on the nose but i think it is an important metaphor. However this is not the only one, they then start piling more metaphors on about greed and i think it starts to loose value when you can't commit to one thing. Also just because a movie is metaphorical doesn't make it good. I have seen people comment ""You just didn't get it"". Yeah i did, it was still messy.It is also painfully slow. Nothing happens for a very very large chunk of this movie. It just has cameos dotted in through it so that people will be like ""Oh cool i love _____"". I think the case is a huge issue as well.Now i love a lot of the people in this cast. It is such a good cast but that is where the studio or someone let the movie down. They pushed so hard about the cast that they made it all rest on them. A lot of the promotion for the movie just talked about the cast, even the poster on IMBd literally talks about the cast. I don't know if they did this because they knew they couldn't market it any other way, i don't know.Talking of marketing i went into this thinking it was a comedy and then about 30-40 minutes in i thought i needed to check to see if it actually was a comedy so i googled it. I can't even say the jokes were unfunny because i feel it had a lack of jokes and I'm not just talking about really obvious jokes it just wasn't humorous. There were moments, more so later on that i was like ""Hm that's a bit funny"" but i think that's why people also don't like it because it was marketed as the ""Funniest all-Star cast"" and it just wasn't.I have never watched any of this directors other films and i do want to as i think he could make interesting films like there were ideas like the dust coming from zombies and not blood.

This movie is so downplayed, that Jarmusch seemed bored with making it, as if he was forced to make it according to some contract obligation.It's not a waste of time; it's not horrible. But please don't pay to see it.",The Dead Don't Die
153,cappiethadog,Website,9,28 October 2019,"The zombie apocalypse survivors have trust issues. They use pseudonyms that are hometown namesakes.""Zombieland"", an action-comedy about the start of a new world, is a zombie movie too post-modern for your dad. Zombies were serious business in George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"". The year was 1968. Your dad may have been an infantryman soldier fighting in Vietnam. Death was no laughing matter. Objective truth still governed American lives. Without the existence of fan fiction websites, brain-eating zombies, by consensus, were deemed scientifically impossible, because people could still distinguish truth from lies. ""Barbara, they're coming to get you,"" Johnny taunts her sister, in the singular humorous moment from the George Romero classic, when he recalls their childhood days in the cemetery with grandpa. No Internet meant that Johnny was easy pickings for the first zombie, since both brother and sister, living in an analog world, had nowhere to turn for directions on how to kill the undead. Barbara and Johnny, in this instance, had the disadvantage of a centralized media. They needed cells with online information, the stuff of science fiction. Johnny turns the dial too soon, never learning what the stentorian voice would say beyond; ""We're just coming back on the air due to technical problems."" During this epoch in time, if that reporter told you to ""kill them in the head,"" you could trust him, as if he was Walter Cronkite himself. But Cronkite wouldn't know what to do.""Civilian"", the adjective used by Officer Ronald Peterson, in conjunction with ""radio"", as in: ""Hey, Cliff, should we listen to the civilian radio,"" stands out, because it sounds superfluous, and jarring, for its seeming redundancy. Is it really, though? Chief Cliff Richardson, his boss and riding partner, grants him permission. By default, they resort to old media, because their cells get no reception. ""The Dead Don't Die"" is the first thing they hear. Written and performed by Sturgill Simpson, the film's title song is played ubiquitously throughout this post-comedy zombie film from Jim Jarmusch, who always knows what distanciation key to play Bertolt Brecht's avant-gardism in. No big deal, right? Many films, brows of all grades, break the forth wall, but Jarmusch swings a bigger sledgehammer than most. ""The Dead Don't Die"" is different. Cliff wonders aloud as to why the song sounds so ""familiar"". Ronnie answers: ""Well, cause it's the theme song."" From Farmer Miller, the guy who wears the faux-MAGA cap, to the out-of-town hipsters, including Zoe, everybody is familiar with this country song, regardless of the person's creed or skin color; and most important of all, political persuasion. Driving into this one-horse town from Cleveland, these urbanites, too, get no cell phone reception and find themselves in the unusual position of being reliant on the radio for both information and entertainment, like it was 1968.""'The Dead Don't Die', I love this song,' Zoe comments, with no variance in opinion from her pals. The needle is close to being on empty. The hipsters fuel up at Bobby's Gas and Stuff. ""Whoa, this place is a trip,"" Jack(Austin Butler) remarks as he surveys the cramped set-up of this rustic hole in the wall that Bobby Wiggins(Caleb Landry Jones), it's proprietor, runs with no apologies. On the surface, this is pure condescension, plain and simple; city slickers having fun at a rube's expense. And yet, from the horror film aficionado, Zoe buys the CD, because she heard the song, a single, which she heard on the radio; an actual physical copy of the album, not a MP3, that contains the title song, as if Bobby's Gas & Stuff was Tower Records. It's 2019, right? Jarmusch is an unabashed NYC intellectual; his audience isn't comprised of braindead zombies. There is audience participation in ""The Dead Don't Die"".Mine for subtext in order to complete Jack's seemingly insolent comment.Finish the sentence: ""Whoa, this place is a trip...to the past.""In my opinion, the filmmaker uses the Sturgill Simpson song as a motif to evoke the monoculture, a commonplace thing that now, in retrospect, seems like a miracle. Predating the advent of the Internet, there was a time when everybody listened to the same music and received news from the same source. Centerville, quite pointedly, is the name of this supposed red state town in ""The Dead Don't Die"", a place where zombies practice non-partisan brain-eating. Zoe, a sophisticate, read as a blue state kind of gal, doesn't believe the governmental propaganda that ""polar fracking"" has no correlation with the sudden alteration of the earth's rotation. Conversely, Fern, a waitress, read as a red state simpleton, may not know a damn thing about literature and eastern religions, when Lily, the cleaning woman, explains to her that Zelda, Centerville's new undertaker and practicing Buddhist, shares the same first name as F. Scott Fitzgerald's wife, but she is an independent-minded thinker, belieing the stereotype that big city coastals have about flyover country denizens. Waitress and hipster are in agreement; they both don't trust the federal government's counter-narrative that purports polar fracking is nothing to be alarmed about. Fern recognizes propaganda when she hears it. She grimaces as the Energy Secretary makes his official statement, predictably anti-science, on the controversial matter. He's cut-off in mid-sentence with Fern's turn of the dial. She plaintively answers: ""Shouldn't it be getting dark out?"" when her regular, Hank Thompson asks: ""So what do you think, Fern?"" She gives a straight answer; she doesn't deflect, parroting the talking points of a partisan automaton, or talking about Centerville's other major story, the town's disappearing animals, both domestic and farm. Because Jim Jarmusch doesn't reduce these small town Americans into ugly one-dimensional caricatures, nobody cheers when the Coffee Zombies eat her, or Lily, down to the innards. Iggy Pop doesn't care that Lily read ""The Great Gatsby"". It doesn't make her better than Fern.Woody Harrelson, in Rueben Fleisher's ""Zombieland"", plays a mercenary-type, who goes by the name of Tallahassee, a geographical alias. His true identity, we suspect, is Hollywood, or some SoCal name echoing some nearby neighborhood with a rich zip code. Tallahassee, the audience realizes, would not cut it as a Florida transplant. ""Zombieland"", in retrospect, looks like a precursor to the real civil war that any day now the country seems to be on the brink of starting. The center couldn't hold, even back in 2009. Since the map got redrawn, the United States is now a country full of mad people. Tallahassee gets away with his bias against the regional undead, because Columbus, and his cohorts Wichita and Little Rock, are preoccupied with staving off death to notice the bigotry. The grocery store sequence; the film's first major action set-piece, Tallahassee not only kills zombies, he humiliates them. Toting a banjo, this man's quest for Twinkies is just a flimsy excuse to annihilate some undead rural folks. He plucks out the opening notes from ""Dueling Banjos"", the Eric Weissberg instrumental from John Boorman's ""Deliverance"", to flush out the hillbillies in an air-conditioned wonderland. He taunts: ""You got a 'purdy' mouth,"" at his first victim in the food aisle. Tallahassee is like the bad person from the other side in which some ideologue from a think tank dreamt up. Being dead gives him an excuse to go on a killing spree, quite pointedly, without a gun, mostly, against people from places such as Columbus, Wichita, and Little Rock, the names of his little marauding gang. Columbus shoots in self-defense, whereas Tallahassee takes pleasure in his newfound freedom. The murder business, you could say, has been deregulated. After opening the yellow Hummer's driver's side-door, Tallahassee gets to work prying ""the cold dead hands"" off from a steering wheel. The guns are dislocated to the backseat. ""Thank god for rednecks,"" Tallahassee cries, when he opens up the bag, thereby reducing their collective persona as rightist ideologues who love ""big trucks and big guns"".""This is all going to end badly.""Ronnie says this repeatedly to the chief. It starts to bug Cliff. He can see with his own eyes that his subordinate's prophecy is coming to fruition. Zombies descend on their squad car. Death is more than a possibility.""How did you know everything in advance?"" the chief asks.And here is when Jarmusch looks at his collection of sledgehammers and picks out the model with the lightest touch.Adam Driver, not Officer Ronald Patterson, knows that things are going to add badly because he ""read the script"". To Bill Murray's dismay, not Chief Cliff Robertson's chagrin, complains that Jim ""only gave me our scenes"".""The Dead Don't Die"" is a ""Network"" for our times. Peter Finch, starring as Howard Beale, an anchorman-turned-prophet, delivers the famous line: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" in the 1976 Sidney Lumet classic. Writer Paddy Chayefsky saw the future; the end of the monoculture, in which melding news with entertainment would result in a fractured society. Now, people get to choose the reality that they feel most comfortable with. ""The Dead Won't Die"" is an adaptation of our times; the two earths. A female newsreader reports on animals gone rabid, instead of the matter at hand, the zombie apocalypse. Each person who sees the work of the Coffee Zombies, as a result, says the same damn thing: ""Was it a wild animal? Was it several wild animals?"" including Ronnie, who knows that it's zombies.He lied.Ronnie lives on Earth 1, but pretends to live on Earth 2, along with the other Centervillans. Instead of correcting them, he adds to the chorus of wild animal conspiracy theorists. The Adam Driver character confirms what people suspect about real world Earth 2 people.They're in on the joke.Sturgill Simpson is mad as hell, too.",The Dead Don't Die

156,RMurray847,"A good cast and some amusing bits, but doesn't hold together.",4,8 January 2021,"There are 20 minutes of really good, funny material in THE DEAD DON'T DIE. Sadly, that's only 25% of the movie. If you ever wondered how good a true indie-film auteur's zombie spoof could be...let me tell you, the answer to that question is still out there.Set in Centerville, USA (a town that feels like it's in rural west Pennsylvania), population 786...things move a little slow. They have one diner, one hotel, 3 cops (and inexplicably, a large Juvenile Detention Center). And one day, all the ""Polar Fracking"" that has been going on causes the earth's axis to shift and the days become longer (or sometimes shorter). But worst of all, it raises the dead from their graves. And these dead feast on the flesh of the living. They also, amusingly, are interested in returning to things they enjoyed. The first two zombies (one is played by Iggy Pop) go to their favorite diner because they love coffee. They also kill the waitress and cleaning lady. And so on and so on.Bill Murray and Adam Driver are the two cops who patrol the city, while Chloe Sevigny mans the phones back at the station. Murray & Driver have an amusing, extremely low-key chemistry that works for awhile, but grows tiresome. Long pauses, punctuated by nonsense. Tilda Swinton appears as the town's new and very odd undertaker. She's a marvel to look at, but her character arc is just odd and nonsensical. But at least she has a sort of arc. Most of the interesting case appear in just a handful of scenes and then either resolve their stories with no emotional heft at all, or the stories just sorta stop. Danny Glover (looking utterly lost), Steve Buscemi (utterly wasted), Caleb Landry Jones, Selina Gomez, Carol Kane, and on and on. Each with about one funny thing to do and then lots of nothing to do. Forget about caring for any of these characters. And forget about the plot really making any sense. (Prime example: a zombie emerges from the grave in tennis wear, because she liked playing tennis. Another is dressed in a football uniform because he liked football. And so forth.) And in zombie movies, usually when you're bitten, you die and turn into a zombie more or less right away. That only happens SOMETIMES in this film. Sometimes you turn after a long wait. And sometimes you don't turn at all, you just die. Pick an internal logic and stick with it!Director Jim Jarmusch has assembled a great cast because many of these folks have worked with him before. But he forgot to assemble a tight movie. Running jokes (about the movie's theme song, about hipsters, about things turning out badly) start as amusing bits but are done past the point of fun, and then some. Jarmusch has told interesting stories, and his deadpan style has worked. But it only seldom works here. The idea of a deadpan, semi-improvisational film about zombies seemed like a good idea. But based on THE DEAD DON'T DIE...it isn't.",The Dead Don't Die

And their was no energy in this movie at all. The cast seemed bored by it all, except for Chloe Sevigny.

Maybe 5-7 in the whole movie so that was fun.There really is no plot since they keep throwing in everything they could. It's done on purpose. You know this isn't a serious plot.There are some cute little throwaway items like the ""Make American White Again"" hat; the Driver reference to Star Wars; the three visiting teenagers all getting killed off even though you were sure at least the woman (Gomez) would have more screen time; the three young people from detention rushing off to a safe place - never to be seen again in the movie.The 4th wall references to the theme song was quirky and out of place but it worked. Sadly they ruined it later on with the 4th wall reference to the script. If they had only just gone for that theme song reference.It is a slow movie full of underused characters - almost none of whom we grow to like. Well maybe the Danny Glover character.

Its tagline of having the ""greatest zombie cast ever disassembled"" is already a giveaway that the movie is going to be an overly-indulgent affair. So many celebrities appear here apparently keen and eager to work with a great director, but Jarmusch has let them all down in this case.
Jarmusch cast regulars Bill Murray, Adam Driver and Tilda Swinton try to be funny while trying not to be funny, and end up all flat on their faces. The deadpan look does not work when there is poor delivery of the lines and the timing is off.
This kind of spoof or satire has been done before, and worked to greater effect in movies like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, which appeared the same year as Jarmusch's brilliant Paterson and which must have inspired the director to take on zombies in a similar fashion.

There is a subplot that involves a group of three kids in Juvenile Detention Center that goes absolutely nowhere and it could have been better if it was cut from the movie, so that the story can have a better focus.

180,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: The Dead Don't Die,7,26 July 2019,"My first thought as this film warped up and the credits began to roll was ""people are going to hate this"". I shared this sentiment with my friend who I was with and he seemed to agree.To start with most of the marketing centered on the rather impressive cast, the posters bosting the tag-line ""The Greatest Zombie Cast Ever Disassembled"". This marketing approach does give of the impression that audience will be treated to a light-hearted Zom-Com featuring a group of interesting and bizarre characters. This is only sort of true, The film has a dry wit to it that often makes it difficult to tell whether or not what you are watching is supposed to be funny, at multiple points I found myself having to contain my laughter despite the fact the nothing particularly funny was happening on screen but that does suit my sense of humour.The jokes being delivered in a unique way is not what I think will divide audiences (although it will contribute) one thing I did not expect was just how much Jarmusch wanted to say about our current society. The film jumps from being about consumerism to the environment to even folding back in and commenting on itself constantly. It hits you on the head with obvious messages about not harming the planet, being nice to people and not allowing brands and products to define you but also has the nerve to feature meta comedy and bizarre side-plots that go absolutely nowhere.This is the point where I tell you that I actually quite enjoyed how off-center and comically nonsensical the experience was. If like me you have seen many zombie movies and are looking for something fresh then this might just be what you are looking for and if not at least there's a pretty sweat Night of the Living Dead reference in it.This film certainly is not for everyone but I recommend watching it anyway to see if you find something to like, however if you do watch it and hate it don't tell me I didn't warn you.",The Dead Don't Die

Its plus points are the well drawn characters, the detailed small town set and its slow gentle pace but its not really enough for the majority of people and that is understandable though the acting is top quality as it should with that cast. It does have enough zombie film gore.
The minus's are it's really not that funny and it doesn't really go anywhere. Slow burning movies are fine if they have some sort of point to them but this hasn't.
The Dead Don't Die could have been good but it just falls short of being a good movie for the majority to enjoy. This film has the minority enjoyed 'cult' movie written all over it, and I'm sure it will be.",The Dead Don't Die
187,safsurfer,All star cast wasted on boring zombie script,6,24 December 2019,This was just a watchable film and rated 6 as the slow subtle humor was dished out by an all star cast that seemed to miss the mark on every strike.

188,terrencepatrix,Even though there are zombies this is not a zombie movie.,3,29 August 2019,"What we have here is a ""zombie movie"" written by someone who clearly hates people who love zombie movies. This entire movie was written as a way to mock people who love the genre and it does it in the most boring, droll, dry, and uninspired way imaginable.The characters are beyond bland and hallow. No one has a backstory, they are simply a singular quirk. The acting is delivered purposefully flat to mock how bad acting can be in zombie flicks. Absolutely nothing happens during the first 50 minutes of the movie except bland, dry, empty character interactions. There's no build up, no plot, there is literally nothing. And then zombies with no real explanation except...zombies! Instead of gore we get sprays of dust. Every scenario is a stereotype but not in a fun or comedic way, just in a ""well this is how it's supposed to happen"" way. Then it's wrapped up with an absurd ""twist"", that's done in such a boring way no one will care, and then back to one final stereotype after a little bit of exposition.With this cast this concept could have been something special except by the end of the movie you can feel the directors complete and utter disrespect for the viewers that he's tricked into watching his movie. This was a movie to take the money of people he thinks are idiots and he has no problem showing it during the conclusion of the film. Ultimately this was just such a waste of time. You'll either be bored to death or somewhat offended by the end of this film, I don't recommend it. I only rated it a 3 because it has Bill Murray.",The Dead Don't Die

The first movie where a zombie apocalypse is the first conclusion everyone reaches. Some great deadpan humor. It gets an extra star for the coffee drinking zombies.

It was meant to be a campy, funny, horror movie.. but the humor was pretty dry and the whole thing just didn't feel like it had the timing. Loved the actors in the movie, but even they couldn't fix the weakness of the movie. Unlike Dawn or even Rocky Horror, it just didn't have the fun feel of a campy movie.. and even under ""altered moods"", I truly don't think this would be funny or allow for ""audience participation"". Nice try... but just didn't measure up to campy fun. Without any plot giveaways, the story line will probably make you go ""really???"".. WHY??

Some errors in who changes and who doesn't. But nothing more divisive than Tilda's role and exit stage up!Not at all unwatchable. Tedious in parts, but altogether a nice trip, if you fancy being stuck in traffic for the most part, then zoom to the end in a fraction of the time.A lot of tongue in cheek moments, specially characters referencing their major roles, and comical killing moments when the victim is recognised before losing its head.Watch it if you're in lockdown and have heaps of time and patience to spare.",The Dead Don't Die

I got the impression that the motive behind this was they were trying to have one of those charmingly laid back movies that is clever, humorous and funny. They failed. The writing is down right dumb. Rosie Perez's character's name is Posie Juarez. I didn't laugh. It was just dumb. Characters keep repeating the same lines. I didn't laugh. In the first 7 minutes there are about 5 political references that happen to be dividing our country on the brink of social civil war. Again, not funny. The writing was blatantly obvious which side you better be on in these issues. Here's what I learned: If you are wearing a MAGA hat (which in the movie states ""Make America White Again"") it is ok to not stop the patrol car to warn him of the danger. The movie doesn't show anything actually bad that this character has done, yet in the end of the movie when the chief has to put him down he says, ""you had this coming."" So apparently if you support a duly elected president that happens not to be in the self described morally upright party you deserve to die. I also learned that only black kids get put in juvy and that they are actually really nice kids that must only be there because they are black.

207,franklindf,Trying to be a camp classic,8,2 September 2019,"This movie makes an attempt to deliver offbeat comedy by following a formulaic pattern of events surrounding a zombie outbreak. The result is moderately entertaining and I almost think they are going for a ""so bad it's good"" type of credential. It's a little hard to conceive of how they got such an A-list cast. Bill Murray in particular is notoriously difficult to reach and cast and I almost think he took this role just to bewilder his fans as to what logic made him appear in this film. The script is completely asinine, with trite and moronic dialogue often dealing with flawed reasoning and logical fallacies. Of course part of the amusement is watching talented actors play such contrived and silly scenes where they have a lackadaisical reaction to a terrifying zombie outbreak and instead obsess about mundane matters such as hipsters and the title song in the movie. Reality definitely is distorted and it's not possible to shake the calm atmosphere and unaffected mentality that prevail in the town; the dire circumstances can't rattle the folksy and eclectic locals. Really none of the actors particularly shine and they aren't supposed to as best I can tell. It's a playful film with meta-commentary, humorous banter, and satire although somewhat brain-dead with lots of facepalm moments.

I am actually somewhat amazed they got so many talented actors to sign onto this disaster.
While people try to defend it using terms like noir, allegory, social commentary, dry humor, and satire, the sad reality is this film is simply bad.
There is no deeper meaning here; the story is hackneyed, the pace plodding, the cinematography uninspired, the dialog stilted, and, like many a Burton film, for the better part of the runtime you find yourself wishing someone would turn a light.
Making matters worse, the entire film reads as a middle finger to rural America.
The portrayal of small town life is as deeply offensive, as it is inaccurate.
Not sure why the makers of this film have such disdain for those living outside cities; however, they might want to seek help because the animosity they clearly hold for middle America seems almost pathological.
While I can understand a studio's desire to cash in on the zombie genre while it remain popular and profitable, I cannot forgive them for subjecting their audience to such a tedious and poorly constructed film.

221,theshanecarr,You can't fake life,4,20 July 2021,"Any viewing of trhis movie starts with those credits; you see that cast; Bill Murray! Adam Driver! Tilda Swinton! Chloë Sevigny! Steve Buscemi! Danny Glover! Rosie Perez! Caleb Landry Jones! Selena Gomez! And Tom ""I'll whittle you into kindling"" Waits! And you think; this movie can't lose.Well, you'd be surprised.Yes, a lot of people showed up to play with Jarmusch but Jarmusch was not ready. The script, especially in the third act, is a mess, full of fun moments but never gaining any narrative momentum. It's like Jarmusch had to start rolling on a particular date to get all these actors lined up, and so they started shooting though there was no third act in sight.Maybe Jarmusch always works like this. Certainly Murray, Swinton, Driver, and Waits have all worked with him before. Maybe they trusted in the old Jarmusch magic to conjure something out of those blank final pages but alas, it was not to be.The setting is Centerville - a village of 738 people whose inhabitants are just trying to go about their daily lives when the dead start rising from the grave. There's no Presidents or scientists in this movie - just the locals trying to get through the night, not understand why it's happening.Although it's billed as a zombie movie, this is best thought of as a hangout movie. If you watch this purely for the pleasure of seeing Murray and Driver slowly trade lines with each other, or to see Swinton good-naturedly act out the offscreen uber-image of her as some sort of strange alien, or to see Buscemi be all crotchety, then you will find some small pleasures here but there is a pervading sense that the film makers had bigger hopes for their movie.The shame of it is that you can almost see how it could have been great. There are clues all over about what this could have been. There are the signs of an environmental crime de coeur beseeching us to treat the planet better in the polar fracking which sets everything going. There are traces of a Romero-esque critique of consumerism in the zombies dedication to the rituals they engaged in when alive. (Most hilariously as some stumble about with phones mumbling ""wi-fiiiiii"".) There's hints of a a small-town big-city clash with Selena Gomez and her city slicker pals arriving into this sleepy hollow, and making fun of Landry Jones. There's the slightest whiff of a political commentary being tossed into the mix with Buscemi's red hat wearing farmer. There's hints of a detached observation of these ridiculous humans in the near-poetic ramblings of Waits as he observes the town from afar.Jarmusch clearly thought he could stir these elements into one big, hilarious horror stew but when you stir this much into the pot, you need a surer sense of what you're making, and it sure feels here like Jarmusch did not.To cover the gaps, he tried throwing in some meta-commentary on the zombie genre - Landry Jones' character is a big geek who has seen all the movies, and knows what to do. This is a route that could work (it did for ""Scream"") but that knowledge never leads to any new insight into the underlying tropes or fears of the genre.Most bafflingly there is a meta bit where Bill Murray asks Adam Driver how he is so sure about what's going to happen, and Driver responds that it's because Jim gave him the full script and he's read it all. It's the kind of dumb-meta joke that does nothing for the film, and which a writer throws in when they really don't know what to write next. (And the ending suggests the same.)Jarmusch, taking his cue from the pace of village life, directs everything at a crawl. We observe characters arriving and having conversations. People take their time. At first, it's a very welcome change of pace from a lot of similar movies, and if Jarmusch had been making a movie about the characters and goings on in this little village, I would have been all in, but the narrative becomes a fight to the death with flesh-eating zombies and yet the same indolent pace permeates throughout. It just doesn't work.If Jarmusch thought he was making fun of horror movies, he needed to dig deeper into the urges underlying them, not simply suggest we're all so jaded now that the earth being thrown off its axis and the dead rising would be greeted with a shrug.The truth is Jarmusch comes off as making a movie in a genre he doesn't love. It's almost crazy how he thought he could just tack on a few of the trappings and play in this sandbox. His lack of interest in zombies rings out loud and clear.I do still love him. There's no one making films like him. I suspect after the brilliance of ""Only Lovers Left Alive""'s take on the vampire genre, Jarmusch, his cast and producers thought they could replicate that movies success here, but their hopes, and mine, were, like so many zombie brains, cruelly bashed out on the ground.",The Dead Don't Die

When I heard that he was going to take on the zombie genre I was initially bewildered why a director like Jarmusch would dabble in one that was so creatively bankrupt. Was there anything new to add? Then the trailer dropped and the deadpan humour was in keeping with his style. I tried to keep a positive thought. Perhaps the trailer, I attempted to rationalise, was a bit of mischievous misdirection to lure people into believing that it was going to be a Shaun of the Dead satire on zombies and then turn into something else. But, alas, those hopes were shattered once I actually watched the film. Midway through I suddenly felt a sad lightbulb flicker on to the realisation that this was a big (and expensive) joke directed at fans of the genre. Instead of injecting some life into this dead genre it turned into a very boring joke. It isn't even very inventive or witty in its humour. I imagine Jarmusch watched a season or two of The Walking Dead and slapped a script together. There is nothing remotely amusing about the film and the most ""memorable"" moments are to be found in the trailer. Characters appear and disappear. Tom Waits is absolutely wasted. Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, looking bored and disinterested as ever. The only likeable and realistic performance is by Chloe Sevigny. Sadly this was a wasted opportunity to do something fresh and interesting,especially when the director is Jim Jarmusch. I imagine he had a big laugh at his little joke. I've avoided to reveal any of the ""plot"" because there isn't one.

229,mkivtt,Utterly boring and pretentious,2,9 April 2020,"Wow, where do I begin. What a worthless pile of garbage.This has a bunch of big-name actors, but obviously not a dime left for an actual plot. Or, more likely: the writer/director actually thought the garbage script he wrote was GOOD. Well, it's not - it's utterly boring.I sat through the first ten minutes, waiting for something to happen. Then twenty minutes. Then thirty. By forty minutes, I'd had enough, and I fast-forwarded the rest of the movie. I'm happy to say I appear to have missed nothing.The entire movie consists of blah-blah dialogue, which I guess is supposed to be ""funny"" but only if you're a pretentious fool like the director. His idea of ""funny"" is apparently having three people who arrive at a scene each say the same line in turn as they arrrive. WOW MAN, SO FUNNY! Give that man an academy award!In the two corpses I did manage to see during the forty minutes, the make-up effects are terrible. Like, ""hey actor, like down here, and we'll put a pile of plastic guts on your stomach that bulges out unnaturally and looks totally fake."" Actual convincing special effects aren't necessary in a zombie movie, right? But then it doesn't matter, because this isn't a zombie movie, it's pretentious, boring garbage.Avoid at all cost.",The Dead Don't Die

The story or lack of it really goes nowhere. Maybe if the movie was shot in black and white and presented as a B grade drive-in horror movie from the 1950's, it might have made more sense? But still it would have been a bad movie even in that genre. If your really bored and have time on your hands, try not to watch this mess, just pick another movie.",The Dead Don't Die

It was very slow but looked good in the beginning. A zombie flick generally has a plot where different characters are somehow put together in difficult situation to fight against the undead and few make it out alive but its the journey which counts. But here that journey becames painful after second half. All characters start dying , there is no moment where u actually get the feeling, yeahh go for it boyz, no thing like that, muvi starts slow and dull and somehow goes on to be even more dull as time passes on. Ending is the worst i could think of. Maybe Jim Jarmusch was trying to portray something i didn't grasp but am fine with it cause its not worth it.

It succeeds on basic levels but is so far inferior to the sum of its parts, it's completely baffling. Definitely feels like they had more fun making it than anyone watching will ever have. It has moments of charm and comedy. It's unclear if it's intentionally bad. It's feigns being clever by breaking the 4th wall, but it's far too dumb and dull to be meaningful. The understatements and overarching themes are so poorly explored and realized it feels like an unfocused mess. Wanted to like this and expected more. It's not satisfying and doesn't deliver. It's like the idea of the movie/trailer did not live up at all to the execution. The references and subtle hints come across as labored and uninspired. Worse it seems like this movie thinks it's making some kind of new unique statement but fails to add anything new and just retreads conventions in a who cares fashion. The pacing wouldn't be so bad if the film wasn't so uneventful. There aren't even really any stakes. No character development so you don't care about any character. Take away the cast and this film wouldn't have much else going for it- some decent makeup, ok cinematography, standard sound design. It's also got a kind of schizopolis thing going for it.",The Dead Don't Die

After you see Adam Driver in this movie; you will learn to love his performance, even more than Star Wars. His performance makes me want to be a cop in a small town. It is no secret that Tilda Swinton is in very cool movies only. Her performance as a mystical samurai master was amazing and one of a kind like the movie. The list of actors is stellar to say the least. To top it all off; Tom Waits stars in this too. That is like a banana split Sunday with a whole jar of maraschino cherries on it.

237,burnzyburns,"Jim Jarmusch fans get it, others don't.",8,26 September 2021,"This movie is completely misunderstood. Technically this movie has nothing to do with zombies. It is more based around the lives of people and their every day doings. When the zombies do come around they act about it as if most people would if an apocalypse were to ever happen. It is with a subtle sense of humour and the creative acting that drives this movie. If you know Jim Jarmusch and his directing style then this shouldn't come as a surprise to you but you'll be sadly misunderstood and disappointed if you think something will ""happen"" (usually not the case with Jarmusch films).I don't feel this movie can reflect too well on today's generation of movie viewers. Jarmusch is old school and set in his ways. Having seen basically all of his movies, I came into this viewing knowing exactly what to expect. He has not adapted to today's predictable directing, and I love him for being a black sheep of the crowd. This movie is on Netflix, and personally I feel it pertains to the wrong crowd and has been seen and reviewed by the wrong people.To conclude: don't expect much to happen in this movie but appreciate every scene of its own. There is a little charm found here for those who understand. It is best to turn your expectations off.Also, props to all the actors in this movie who all did a fantastic job!",The Dead Don't Die
238,onexmillion,Snoooooooooze,3,6 September 2019,"Thing is with undead movies, they either need to be genuinely funny or fast paced with lots of action.

239,LBarlane24,Oh God,2,23 June 2019,"Written and directed by Jim Jarmusch, the film stars Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, and a whole bunch of other familiar faces. It is a zombie movie ... and that's pretty much it.I'm going to start off by saying that I honestly had no desire to see this movie, but my mom dragged me to seeing it with her anyway. When doing just that, I was bored nearly to death; no pun intended.Most (if not, all) of the jokes are either repetitive or fall completely flat (mostly because the characters continually state the obvious) and most of the subplots go absolutely nowhere; there's also a supposed plot-twist involving a certain character apparently being an alien, which, yes, is as utterly pointless as it sounds.One of the only times I actually laughed was when the female deputy got eaten alive after trying to reunite with her undead grandmother; another time I chuckled was when the two leads broke the fourth wall during the climax.Not only is this the worst movie of the year so far, not only is it the worst zombie movie I have ever seen, it is quite possibly the worst comedy starring Bill Murray I've ever seen in my life. I really don't know who thought that this was a good idea, besides Mr. Jarmusch, and I certainly have no clue why so many people are praising it.PS, I read a YouTube comment saying that is basically Mars Attacks with zombies, which is probably correct.",The Dead Don't Die

But this schlock is obviously directed at high school students as an attempt at indoctrination. So what's new? It begins and ends not very well.What a waste of acting talent - except for that of Tilda Swinton's. Maybe no one would have gone to see this film if it weren't for the stars in it.

Bill Murray with his dry humor and deadpan stare, man I love the guy, but not in this, even he couldn't save it.Theres just no point to it. It was put out there like it was a horror comedy, it's not scary or creepy and its definitely not funny. The writing is bad, the pacing is bad, the jokes (if thats what they are) are bad. the build up some characters like the kids from Cleavland but why? They had no part in the story.

Have they never seen a cult film from the 80's or 90's? You know, the ones that are classics, that films that are made today are based off of?
Such as, Evil Dead, Tremors, Trancers, Braindead, Escape from New York and even Happy Gilmore.
Hollywood has tried to kill these kind of movies, but some make their way through, some aren't very good, but this seems like a cult in the making.
People these days are so used to Hollywood blockbusters, that anything other just seems wrong, and that isn't right!
I really enjoyed it, brought me back to the days watching those old cult classics, the same feel, humour, acting and pacing.
It isn't the best film you'll ever see, but it certainly isn't the worst by any long shot, and it has a great cast that you can tell enjoyed working on it.

After that beautiful jaunt into relatable filmwork, and a trio of really relevant artists on screen, the cast of this film promised another digestible, Hollywood-leaning effort...and, boy oh boy, that is not what happened.As slow, as quiet, and as disinterested with story, convention, and resolution as he usually is, if one is buckled in to watch a Jarmusch joint, this is really fun. There aren't many laughs, but they were big. The cast is delightful, and you couldnt accuse anyone of being overused. Very little happens, but there's a surprising amount of Tom Waits talking, which I always like.In a weird way, this feels like Jim Jarmusch fan service - a slow, aimless collage of short conversations between interesting people, with a scrap of plot for everyone to hold onto, such that they all stay around the same place. I enjoyed it, and I think if you enjoyed DOWN BY LAW, or GHOST DOG, you would enjoy this, too.If, by comparison, you dont know the director, and just like zombie movies...I'd be hard pressed to recommend this.",The Dead Don't Die

I am also a fan of weird movies, whether they are mind-benders or just surreal. I tried, I really did. There was not much to like though.There is a couple of actual jokes. One was almost funny. There is excessive gore, more disturbing than in an average horror movie. There is constant breaking of 4th wall, and not in a graceful way.They brought top actors and gave them... nothing, really. They have slightly more lines than an extra in an average movie. Heck, Iggy Pop is used as an extra - why?Ah but Tilda Swinton plays a character named Zelda Winston, Adam Driver has a Star Wars key chain, and Steve Buscemi (aka ""Donnie"" in ""Big Lebowski"") wears a MAGA-like hat (because... Donnie?). Bill Murray is cast against type, I guess: not the usual sarcastic and bitter self, but just a guy who simply does nothing. George Romero is mentioned and then his Dawn of the Dead is ripped off, but in a way that it's hard to care about what is actually happening.The only bright spot is Tilda Swinton, who somehow got a slightly more meaningful role than the rest.If not the big names involved, the entire movie would've been overlooked and forgotten upon release.

255,ReadingFilm,I only like how much everyone hates it,1,30 October 2019,"I wonder why actors so love being zombies in films. It's like it fulfills the primordial inner dullard of our bacterial origins. It's some ritual to return to a state without agency--maybe similar to why we veg out to the screen is they reflect the medium of watching so purely. Here, Tom Waits clearly is the stand-in for Jim Jarmusch in the jungle, this shamanic figure who' knows' with predicting nodding as it all goes down. (But then Jim also exists in the very universe, and even 'that' Jim knows, as Kylo says; it presents this frame of both narrators 'knowing'. A double knowing.) I thought what is the meaning of this film, is this nihilistic or learned helplessness? It's a post-society reaction to today, of course, at best a post-ironic work missing Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly. But why it's misconceived is that it overstates the importance of the arts in the first place, where that feeling of hopelessness implied society was ever in the hands of artists or their values; when the arts thrive in healthy economies to produce a Jarmusch who seems indignant of the very bodies championing him, despite his lack of marketability, how can he remark if the people are out of touch politically, or environmentally wrong? I also remembered The Beach Bum. Much like that film, Dead Don't Die is a picture of its inspiration in time. Jim's angriest film, and this is its brutal cavalier violence against the 'other'. The joke is whenever it falls flat, and it's a great stunt, and very very briefly in shades we get how this could all be positively poetic. But why Korine's was so brilliant is for a moment the outrage aligned with his irresponsibility so he was there somehow an archetypal voice of the outraged half. That film, in retrospect, was mythic. While Jarmusch's zen moral relativism never applied but to the outsider already, suddenly he's a satirist speaking for us. It doesn't align or read. It's his worst film, even worse than the assassin one-but Tim Burton had Mars Attacks-and Jarmusch, Burton, and Wes are our three eccentric American stylists entitled to their tangents. His oeuvre is so good you just chuckle and say, right on.",The Dead Don't Die

And I can't really say I've been a fan of what I've seen.But this guy who usually does arthouse films did a Zombie flick? Uhm. Ok. That alone made me curious. Now I've seen it, and I think I have to seek out more of this guys stuff.Looking over others reviews I see a pattern of tons of people who call this dull and dreadfully boring. Well, call me a contrarian, but for me this was a refreshingly irreverent sendup of a genre that's been so ground into the ground by endless upon endless rehashings of the same story. Just to have characters in a Zombie film who actually have consumed zombie media is shockingly uncommon.Staunchingly refusing to go for tiresome tropes we follow a diverse cast of characters in a tiny town in the middle of USA as they come to realize that maybe because of strange new ways of getting natural resources halfway around the world, there might now be a full on Zombie apocalypse upon us. The tone is irreverent. Flauntingly illogical and surreal at times. And I loved it. The ending is a bit anticlimactic while at the same time made me go "" wait... So this was all a remake of THAT FILM?!"". If you expect a normal horror flick in the tone of the Romero inspired genre. You may well be dissapointed by the unnatural acting, the plotting that seem haphazard at times. And the flippant attitude. I hesitate to compare it to classics like Shaun of the Dead though the humor is similar and we follow people who quickly grasp that the events line up with characteristics of the genre and just accepts that they now have to destroy brains or remove the head to survive.If anything. It's a bit more like Dupieux masterpiece Rubber. You might just need to embrace the odd surreal stylings in order to enjoy. It sure ain't for everyone, but it did work for me!But as Adam Drivers character did say many times throughout the story. This will end badly... And he knows...

Jarmusch tried to make this as a Tarantino movie but failed so hard and missed the whole point. I could not crack a smile the entire movie and this was advertised as a comedy. The plot is so cringe and even most of the actors know how cheap this was. There is nothing original here, nothing happens for almost 1 hour and the movie is 1h&40min.

I liked most of the actors going into the movie (besides my irrational hatred of Adam Driver) so it looked like a quirky little comedy.But this wasn't very indie, the humor wasn't so much dry but more like flaccid, the visuals were fine with some gags and interesting topics, the zombies reduced to meta commentary a la ""Warm Bodies"", and the boring quirkiness made me wanna throw up outside a diner.But, apparently, the lack of comedy, acting, plot, and interest was on purpose. Like setting your house on fire and claiming it was for the insurance money but really, you just wanted to go to jail to avoid going to your niece's birthday party: a grand and in your face presentation for nothing of importance.It's was OVERLY in your face about the meta fourth wall ""ha ha look at how quirky I am, subverting the subversion of the genre"". It was SCREAMING about how dull and slow and quiet everything is, it's neon lights on what could have been funny and entertaining and watchable.I gave it a 3, because Tilda Swinton is a joy to watch in everything, and she brought the only human touch to the movie.

The opening act is solid enough and the deadpan style humour is immensely promising, but about halfway through it just shows all of its cards - it's half-baked nonsense leading nowhere that appears to think it's far, far more amusing, smart and entertaining than it actually is.I think there was one or two moments, a few brief seconds, that did manage to land and invoke a mildly positive response, but they're lost in a sea of utter nonsense - and the worst kind of nonsense, the kind that's devoid of any redeeming qualities and just painfully unravels as you first pray for it to improve, and eventually just to end.In fairness to the cast, they do a good job, but everything else about the movie is beyond sub-par. For me it wasn't just a bad genre film, but a plain outright poor film by any yardstick imaginable that doesn't even come close to the 'so bad its good' bar either.I think this is genuinely the worst misfire of a film I've seen in a very long time.

Every body in these just seemed monotone, as if they reading the script off cue cards. The only decent actors in this were the kids and they don't really get much to do either, Iggy pop did a good job but his situation was a little different.All the best bits were used in the trailer, credit to it the trailer is awesome but this was just garbage. Nothing really happens in the movie at one point people are just watching zombies, why would you watch them? Bloody run or kill them don't just watch them. Speaking of pointless we get the dead don't die song played in it's entirety 3 times during this movie once for the credit card. Then the other times was a long pan of a car driving in the distance, yes it is a good song and I'm glad that they put it in here as it's the only decent thing about it. The song is 4 minutes long, why on earth did you do a black screen with names on it for 4 minutes? That's not even an artistic choice, any idiot can put colour names on a black screen. The introduction works as it's meta but as soon as the credit card the movies stops being meta, it's just really weird and jarring. This isn't really a spoiler but at the end it tries to tie itself to some social commentary, it's so out of the blue though no where in the movie did it even mention anything close to that the closest you got was 3 people looking at the same thing and then saying the same thing which was supposed to be a joke.

There are a few problems here: one, paying close to 15.00 a ticket plus 10.00 for poopcorn, mind you that's for one person, you expect to get your moneys worth (those who disagree are the ones that can afford these ridiculous prices and they don't see the big picture that 90% of the working class cannot...) second, I don't care who you are, we don't need to focus on the name of the directors or writers or what have you, we need to focus on the movie itself. I understand, we are creatures of habit & that we follow the herd so we accept that the reason(s) why a movie, such as this, is too slow because that's the way a certain director(s) moves but not me, nope. That's no excuse; that we as an audience have to sit there & eventually nod out for close to an hour - wasting these extraordinary talented actors in a battle of vanilla, bland sarcasm. The two main characters were asleep at the wheel, literally. Pick up the friggin pace, it's a horror film. It's a zombie film. The film turned out to be a horrorble film (yeah, I know, spelling error) The bickering between the two characters is ad nauseum yet finally the last turd ( whoops, another error) of the film FINALLY becomes a zombie movie but by then I'm spent & have no love for this energy suckfest.

I mean Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, even Steve Buscemi... I was a little bit sceptic on the script ""another zombie movie""? What else is there to add? It turns out nothing at all! Shawn of the Dead did great job brining something new and fresh into this specific genre but this is just same old story, nothing we haven't seen million times before, unfunny, boring, uninspired, dull... There are some vivid characters introduced and they just die, very quickly, before we even get to know them at all.In general, it's very difficult to bring something new into ""zombie"" movies, especially as comedy, and this was so forced and over the top with too many characters neither properly introduced, just famous names appear then die, over the top message about consumerism pushed onto viewer, over the top coming out of nowhere alien story, trying to be funny but failing miserably, etc. It just didn't sit well with me. I tried, I gave it a 3 but it's hardly even that considering potential with actors and probably money invested. ""Dead Alive"" was done on like 100$ budget and it was still 10000 times better movie, and a really GOOD movie on its own, than this.",The Dead Don't Die
268,sagniknath,somewhat amusing but could have easily achieved so much more,6,22 June 2019,"The only two Jarmusch films I have previously watched and which will form the basis of my reference for this movie are: Dead Man and Only Lovers Left Alive. Now both these aforementioned films are not the typical popcorn movie. They are somewhere between being general entertainers and art films, leaning slightly to the latter. However, they both felt like SOLID movies, with the audience feeling a sense of conclusion to the narrative being told in them.However, The Dead Don't Die really doesn't compare much to either of these previous Jarmusch ventures. Which is so sad, because it has the trappings of achieving cult status: great actors, a quirky if not so original premise and a great rural setting ripe for a 50s B horror movie pastiche . I did like the exchanges between the lead actors , Bill Murray and Adam Driver. Their onscreen relationship was probably the centerpiece of the movie.The side characters sadly didn't have much dimension or rather much to do really, but the actors portraying them were professionals and tried to inject as much quirkiness to them as possible to make them somewhat memorable. You are led to believe that one side character might be the key to resolving the narrative conflict presented but, as acclaimed film critic Jay Bauman likes to mention often, the film ""subverts your expectations"" in a bad way.There are some genuine laughs here and there. There is quite a lot of meta humor as well; some land well , others quite don't.Overall, I really wouldn't go so far as to NOT recommend this movie. If you just want to chill, seat back and just enjoy a somewhat offbeat comedy without investing too much in the narrative flow, you might find the movie OK and amusing. Else, hoping for a zombie comedy along the lines of Shaun of the Dead or Zombieland might get you frustrated at having watched this.",The Dead Don't Die

The little bit of social commentary and few attempts at humor fell flat. The actors all seemed to be in pain. A dull chronic pain that they were all tired of fighting, and not just because that was what they were apparently supposed to be doing. It was as if even the sleepy deadpan delivery of lines was hard to pull off in this ultra snooze fest.
I love all things Zombie. Until this movie. A little beyond the half-way point, a character loses it and screams something along the lines of ""I can't take this anymore."" The audience surely wishes for death FAR more than that character.
And if you make it to the end, you're rewarded with a narrated statement of the social commentary in case you wisely fell asleep in the first few minutes. One of the worst zombie movies ever made. Not clever. Not funny. Not scary.
I choose to view this movie as commentary on the product Hollywood puts out these days. As such, I give it one star because in that sense it hits the nail on the head, though it could have achieved that simply by looping the scene from Idiocracy where they show a bit of a movie from that future, the entirety of which is apparently just a bare backside Farting.

First and foremost, however, this is a Jim Jarmusch film -- a quirky, modestly paced, clever, slightly off kilter character study where events take place, but very little actually happens. His 2013 film Only Lovers Left Alive cemented Jarmusch among my favorite directors. That film also featured my favorite actress, Tilda Swinton...Who makes a brilliant return in The Dead Don't Die as the long white haired Scottish samurai funeral home director... with a secret! I mean, she's amazing. Adam Driver is also great, and delivers the biggest laugh of the movie.The messaging about consumerism does get a little heavy handed late in the film, and some of the fourth wall breaking might alienate some audiences (although it works for me here as a kind of commentary on the pointless foolishness of the zombie genre).7.5/10",The Dead Don't Die

The movie used differed tricks, from breaking the 4th wall in a bunch of weird ways, to going for deadpan in the most bizarre storyline to use deadpan in to outright elements that come out of nowhere like a narration right at the end.
The film's slow pace will throw off some people unfortunately but that is the price to pay for what the movie delivers and it certainly is worth it.
Because the movie in turn becomes different because of it.
The market is filled with zombie flicks from Shaun of the dead to zombie land to world war Z to Train to Busan and all of these share the same tropes even if in different genres of action, horror or comedy.
This movie delivers something different, and nothing is wrong with the typical zombie flick tropes but it is nice to see something new.

281,beetle-259-554148,A Guide on what NOT to do during a zombie apocalypse.,3,22 June 2021,"This movie had a LOT of potential but just fell completely flat. Bill Murray has a few good funny lines but judging by the remainder of his performance as well as Adam Driver's, they both put almost no effort or emotion in and seem to be there just so they can cash a paycheque. When Bill first sees a zombie, he acts completely calm which would lead you to believe this is because he knows what to do, right? WRONG. He shoots this zombie twice in the chest before Adam hacks its head off.Selena Gomez and a '67 LeMans (identical to the one from Night of the Living Dead including it's real-life color of light green) show up but they really do nothing at all, aside from the LeMans providing fan service. They also get Steve Buscemi to play a racist farmer (though this only goes as far as him wearing a MAGA-like hat, even though he shares scenes with Danny Glover) but like Selena Gomez and her two friends, is only there to add to the number of kills. This movie also MAJORLY skimps on the gore. In fact, this is one of the least bloody zombie movies ever. At least five characters find themselves ""overcome by the zombie hordes"" but we never see people getting torn apart and eaten alive; no limbs are torn off, no guts are ripped out, there's no grand gory ""THE KILL"" like Capt. Rhodes in Day of the Dead or David in Shaun of the Dead.Speaking of that, several characters, including our two leads, make a bevvy of unbelievably stupid, STUPID decisions. For example, Danny Glover and the town's gas station owner take shelter in the town's hardware store which also sells guns and completely board up the store's front door but forget about the back... even though it's in plain sight from the front and Mr. Glover's character has presumably owned this store for a while. The zombies break down the back door and these two are goners. Any sane person during a zombie apocalypse in this situation would turn their gun on themselves before the zombies even got within biting distance... these two just stand there and let themselves get eaten. The town's three cops drive INTO A CEMETARY (where the majority of the zombies are coming from) AND GET THEIR CAR STUCK ON A ROW OF BODIES (that they most certainly saw and knew that their Crown Vic would not be able to drive over).At one point the car is completely surrounded and one of these officers can no longer take the stress of the zombie apocalypse and decides to kill herself. Now if you were a cop in this scenario, what would you do? Perhaps find a long straight stretch road, get your cruiser going as fast as possible and then crash into the next support beam you see? Perhaps you would put your gun's barrel in your mouth? Possibly take advantage of the handy-dandy shotgun next to you, take out the car's windshield and GTFO? What does this example of shining intellect do? She gets out of the car and allow the zombies to eat her alive. She choose to be torn limb-from-limb and disembowled rather that eat a bullet; she chose one of the most painful and horrifying ways to go instead of one of the quickest and most painless. -_-Shortly after she bites it, the zombies are distracted by something else and begin flocking away from the car. You would think that our two surviving cops would take this opportunity to get out of the car, make a run for it and seek alternative transportation. Perhaps try and spot the recently undead female cop, kill her, take her keys, make a break to the station and escape in her car? Yeah her car is a 2nd-generation Prius but any port in a storm! Or they could have waited until all the zombies were a safe distance away, one of them gets out and pushes the car while the other floors the gas and if that doesn't work, kill the undead lady cop and take her keys for plan B and if THAT doesn't work, the first possibility I talked about would become plan C.

The performances from the cast especially Adam Driver and Bill Murray are excellent and they work very well together. I saw a lot of negative reviews for this film and was expecting some weak humour with a thin story but the gags in the film were great. Jim Jarmusch wrote some very clever dialogue with excellent set ups, which lead to even better payoffs especially near the end of the film.The most glaring issue this film has, is that there are a lot of open plot points and there are some characters that don't need to be in the film at all. You could cut them out and the movie wouldn't be any different, which can feel like a bit of a waste as they could have used that screen time for other gags, and focus on the main set of characters, who were engaging and hilarious.Overall I had a very good time with the dead don't die, if you keep your expectations in check and are looking for just a fun rewatceable film this is definitely one I would recommend.

But writer/director Jim Jarmusch wasted all that talent and created a worthless piece of trash.Jarmusch seems to have been confused as to what movie he wanted to make. Early in the movie 2 characters discuss a song on the car radio while noting that it is the theme song to the movie they are in. Near the end of the movie the same 2 characters discuss the script. But at no other time do characters break the 4th wall, so those 2 instances feel out of place.At one point a flying saucer shows up and a central character beams up into it. But flying saucers were not otherwise involved in the plot so this appears to be a random, unexplained scene that would have been better left on the cutting room floor.There are so many familiar faces in the cast that it seems like a ""Who's Who"" of acting. But Jarmusch didn't know what to do with them. So they just take turns becoming zombie victims. We never get to know these characters so their appearances are little more than cameos.Finally, the movie just abruptly ends as if the last pages of the script got lost.

To give credit where credit is due, there are some great clever things about the film. The pacing of it and the way some scenes play out is actually funny and you can see what the director was going for. The film makes a commentary about the genre itself in several ways and in the beginning it's pretty funny.
But the film then makes a commentary past the genre about society, and it does it in a not so subtle way that does not really add anything to the story or setup. It's contrived and unearned. The cleverness is lost and the film is trying too hard, leaning into it's commentary on the genre and society too much. What was funny becomes unfunny and unnecessary.If you are looking for a fun zombie film with lots of Gore, this film will disappoint. If on the other hand you want to watch something different with 2 great lead performances, this movie is surprising and good for a 1 time watch.After the halfway point of the film, it doesn't offer much more.

I think this has been bashed a lot because of people expecting more than they got, especially considering the cast. There may be one too many characters, some of whom don't even get a resolution, but the cast here is one of the most unique and versatile I've seen in a long time. It's got a pretty half-assed message about consumerism (been there done that,) but there's tons of cool nods, references and call-backs to other films, as well as mocking a lot of clichés found within the zombie sub-genre.Heading up the cast are two previous Jarmusch collaborators, Bill Murray and Adam Driver, and they're responsible for a lot of the film's dead-pan humour. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the film's almost too dead-pan because some of the jokes just didn't land for me and felt a bit dry. I'd be here all day if I was to list off the whole cast and characters, but some notable favourites of mine were Tilda Swinton's Scottish Mortician; Caleb Landry Jones as the horror-obsessed clerk and, although his role was sadly very limited, Iggy Pop as a coffee-swilling zombie. Some of the cast felt very under-utilised, like I said before some of them don't even getting a resolution in the story. The three kids, in what I think was a young-offender's institute, were basically just forgotten about right before the movie's final scene.There were aspects of the film I wasn't a big fan of, most of all the UFO scene towards the end, but the fourth-wall breaks worked for me, especially when they refer to Jarmusch directly. You could pick at this film for hours over it's discrepancy and frequent jumps between characters, but if you just go with the flow and try to have a good time, it's really not as bad as people make out. I mentioned before it's message about consumerism, which is admittedly derivative, but the fact that it's more relevant today than ever sort of lets that slide for me. I got a good chuckle out of the zombie outside of the pharmacy moaning ""Xanax.""Overall, this really isn't the most polished film, but it's one of the most original zombie films to come out in a while, even if a lot of it is satirising the tropes of the genre. It's got more than a few societal critiques, not all of which I could get behind, but the dry, meta humour stops it from feeling preachy. Fair enough the ""cell-phone bad"" message is a bit overdone, but that's just one little thing in a film full of stuff to pick up on. I will admit this could've been a lot better, especially by Jarmusch's standards, but cut the guy a break, this isn't that bad...",The Dead Don't Die

The plot is extremely slow and predictable. Makes it very hard to watch. Not sure what the director was getting at here. Character development was almost none existent which compounds the slow plot development.Lastly and most annoyingly, the director uses symbolism to gripe about politics. This was the last straw for the film.Film makers take note...most people go see films to ESCAPE the daily politics and reality of the world. We don't go to films to be reminded of them and preached to. Leave politics out of films unless you film is about politics or a documentary.",The Dead Don't Die

Their chemistry throughout made the film better than it actually was.
Dark humor...lots of zombies!!
Tilda Swintons character was odd..made all the more so in the scene of her exit.
A lot of breaking the fourth wall , coming out of character without actually looking at the camera at the audience.
I did very much enjoy this film despite a few dumb scences that almost spoiled the movie for me... Such as the Tilda Swinton science in the field. I won't spoil it you'll know it when you see it.

308,craigbenting,Most People Don't Like Movies That Point The Mirror At Them,7,30 October 2021,"Well, I can tell why so many people don't like this movie -- because they saw themselves in it, and it was not flattering.I don't know, I liked it a lot. But, I woke up over 15 years ago to the reality this movie starkly shows about human beings. The truth is, this is an old school zombie movie, showing the origin of the genre itself.Zombies are the human beings we all see every day, obsessed with all the stuff in life that has nothing to do with living life.Aside from this commentary on human beings that goes straight back to the original Night of the Living Dead, I do love the slow pacing of this movie, set to match the slow pace of small town life.The first 1/3 to 1/2 of the movie just made me think, yeah, this is the zombie apocalypse as it would look in the small town I grew up in (or the farm I grew up on). But, before that even happened, I thought, yeah, this is what people in small towns do, all day, every day. Slow going, but living life.Pretty amazing people find it terrible in a movie. It drove me nuts as a kid, which is why I worked so hard to move to a (relative) city in California.So, bottom line, if you're one of the zombies, you don't wanna watch this movie. If you're not, especially if you grew up or live in a small town, you'll probably like this movie a lot.

I'm thinking that Jarmusch should stick to avant-garde type films because he sucks at comedy. There were a few good lines but there was not enough to sustain the film.

317,pixiekatten,"Judged on Jarmusch-ness, not the Z-factor.",5,4 January 2020,"When Jim Jarmusch makes a Z-flick one should immediately realise it will not be a traditional Zombie movie. And therefor not even try to compare it to to the existing catalogue of Zombie gore, comedy, drama etc. Jarmusch will do what Jarmusch does - something entirely different. His style. His vision. And this might not be in everyone's liking as his film are often dialogue driven - the story is in the details of what's being said. And I however do enjoy many of his previous films. That's why I review this as a comparison to these, and rate ""The Dead Don't Die' according to what I expected from him as a film maker.The usual quirkiness is there. The social commentary is attempted but gets a little bit in your face. And I do like the characters - or what they could've been rather. I bet they looked good on paper and that's why so many signed up to be part of the ride. Just that it is not a ride. It drags and limps until it finally reaches the zombie stand off. An all star cast can't save the scenes - the script is simply not the usual poetry and the lines are delivered without finesse nor humour. It feels like the movie lacks decent directing too.I never expected it to be a scary movie. But it's not a funny movie either - and I did expect at least a few laughs. Since when has Bill Murray not provided comedy gold! All in all I am disappointed, and sometimes slightly confused, by the lacklustre performances. 1hr40min feels long, though there are a few highlights. Iggy Pop's coffee zombie was slightly entertaining. I won't tell you not to watch it, but save it for a rainy day when there's not much else. It will not have you greatly entertained - but it will pass the time.",The Dead Don't Die

You get the feeling of the countryside, small town gossip etc. There is a quirky atmostphere and dialogue. The effects are quite nicely done. The is some gore, but it´s not overdone, so even if you are not fond of blood and guts you can mostly enjoy the movie.
The bad: Well, the second half. The writer and director just doesn´t seem where to go with this movie. Side stories and up in nothing.

Characters are so one dimensional that even all of the really brilliant actors couldn't pull them off. It was (and I can't believe I'm writing this about a Jarmusch movie) cutesy at best, with lots of sassy little moments which clashed horribly with the very slow plot development and dialog delivery.

The film attempts to break the 4th wall at least twice, although there were points of the film where I tuned out like the constant wild animal joke or that lame country song. You can tell they got stoned and wrote the script for this movie in one day. It tries so hard to be ironic, but it ends up being painful to tolerate, and the cheap shot leftist narratives snuck into the film to give the viewer an idea as to why what's happening is happening is not only boring and weak, but ridiculous in the same sense.

Yet its extended climax involves maybe a hundred zombie-actors arranged in a cemetery, and there are carefully-choreographed scenes of, for example, cars threading through zombies scattered along a street. Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Chloe Sevigny, Tilda Swinton and a host of others do their best to make the whole thing work: although all of them are known for more substantial productions, none of them give the impression that the work is beneath them. That position is left to writer/director Jim Jarmusch. Isn't the '80s hipster thing wearing a bit thin by now? Whatever one can say about zombie movies as a genre, there is generally some room for affect - that is, a hint of emotion. This is true even of zombie comedies: the characters in Edgar Wright's Shawn of the Dead, Andrew Currie's Fido, even the Zombieland films, have to undergo excruciating things in the course of their stories. The Dead Don't Die feels as if was made by one of those ""hipsters from the city"" that its characters dismiss: like hipsters, the only way they can show emotion is in their choice of music, so when Murray's character flips the CD of the title song out the window of his police cruiser, it's a telling moment (and one welcomed by the audience - by this time, we've heard this song quite enough), and one that indicates that there could be a lot more happening in The Dead Don't Die, if only Jarmusch had the courage to portray it.",The Dead Don't Die

Characters have literally no backstory so it's impossible to care about them, nothing is fleshed out there are no explanations for what's happening, Tom Waits just wanders about looking at stuff through binoculars and talking to himself, it all goes NOWHERE!

It was nice to actually see a director's vision as oppose to a film that's obviously been weighed down with studio interference.This movie definitely isn't for everyone. I get the feeling that the people who've given this a bad review or a low rating were expecting another Zombieland, or something in that genre.

Examples of wasted characters:Tilda Swinton's Irish coroner. She had a sword and was taken up by aliens.That's her role.
Chloë Sevigny. She was the useless chick cop. who was eaten after seeing her grandma.
Selena Gomez and friends, they went to a motel and died.This is all these characters do. The rest of the cast's parts can be summed up the same. This film was a waste of money and time. Jim Jarmusch comes off as a pretentious fraud after seeing this movie.",The Dead Don't Die

All I can guess is that the producers offered the cast an astounding amount of money to be in this dreadful film & hopefully they didn't list the income as work when filing their taxes because I've seen more convincing acting from my dog (when compared to people in this film) when she plays dead (& she peeks & blinks at me when she does it).
Adam Driver recently walked out of a radio interview because they played a clip of him singing in his latest film & apparently he has a phobia of hearing/watching his performances back...now, I can see why. This film also gave me a phobia of watching Adam Driver (who managed to display less emotion in this film than he did in the Star Wars films when he actually had his helmet on).
You would think Bill Murray & Tilda Swinton could save ANY film...they could not...they could, in fact, make it even worse.There is an old saying - ""Procrastination is the thief of time.""

I got the sense it was gonna be a little weird when near the beginning of the movie Adam Driver and Bill Murray are driving along when the song ""The Dead Don't Die"" comes on the radio and Bill Murray says it sounds really familiar and Adam Driver remarks ""it's the theme song"" meaning the theme song for the movie. Then nearing the end, after Adam Driver's character saying several times during the movie ""this is going to end badly"" Bill Murray's character has had enough and asks why he keeps saying that and Adam Driver responds saying ""I've read the script"" which leads to a dialogue surrounding the movies script. There is a bizarre character played by Tilda Swinton (who I love) who without warning or back story ends up being an alien and being beamed to her spaceship which then promptly fly's off??? There is a significant storyline surrounding 3 teenagers who manage to escape from an zombie overrun youth detention centre and who after running into town one says to the others she knows a place they can hide and then we never see them again??? We are introduced to 3 young adults one of which is played by Selena Gomez who look like they are going to be main characters but who without warning die. We don't see them die but instead Bill Murray and Adam Driver happen upon their hotel room to find them dead. As I said, I'm not sure which direction they were going with this movie but I just don't feel like they even got close to nailing it. Sometimes you can be too clever and it ends up being messy. One good thing (at least for me), it was nice to see Bill Murray and Carol Kane together again.

My favorite scenes were with the police by far, but after that, the other characters were not interesting.Some people have said that it's purposely bad to be meta with what Adam Driver was saying the whole time.

Can you make yourself love it if you are not a Buddhist? Probably not. If you are one of the Americans who expects Judeo-Christian themes in your action flicks, you will find this as unsatisfying as Asian action films in which the happy Buddhist ending ( hero comes to know himself, detaches from his attachments, accepts non-dualism into his life) seems like a real downer.",The Dead Don't Die

The star studded cast are wasted on a poor script and a worse plot (if it can be called that - it's basically ""the dead come back to life in a sleepy town"").
You can tell the person who wrote this had dreams of it becoming a cult classic - forgetting that although usually a little of the beaten track, cult classics always have something unique about them - and there's nothing new or interesting here.

People are going to be pissed off by it. People are not going to like what they thought would be a goofy zombie movie starring Bill Murray. I admit at first I had thought that that was exactly what it was going to be. This is a very pointed denunciation of where America is at the moment, and, very obviously, Trump's America. It's message is unpalatable, or, palatable depending on your stance. Whether or not you feel that the message is correct, either way you will be disturbed by this film. In that sense it's very scary.

The script was awful with amateurish dialogue. It just went nowhere. Scene after scene of bland unfunny dialogue and not so special effects.
Right up until the end credits I was hoping for something exciting or unexpected to happen but it never did. A monotonous and badly made film with very little action and awful pacing. I'd say about 70% of this movie was just padding and slow, slow protracted scenes of talking about nothing.

The zombie sequence had hilarious commentary on humanity one of my favorite sequences and the banter between Murray and Driver was always funny and Iggy POP omg hahahaa. The acting was great, and loved the direction and writing. I think many don't like this movie because the humor is so dry and so clever and it will breeze by you if you don't pay attention, you have to really get that type of humor and be into it and think - I love it and think it's genius. It's also a slow burn which I also love - it's not your typical horror movie. The only thing I did not like was the ending because I felt it didn't trust the message that was already coming through so clear throughout and so it was pushed and got unfunny - but who cares, the rest of the movie was a hysterical. And it was ORIGINAL - sure it spoofed the genre but the voice of Jarmusch is so original he puts his own twist on things and doesn't make movies like anyone else - love em or hate them - he marches to his own drum and creates his art - and I don't like all of his but I LOVE this.",The Dead Don't Die

386,nedski7,Zombie and country music mixture....,6,2 September 2019,"A movie made by the great Jim Jarmusch, most probably in one of his holidays when he had his brain relaxed.
The movie is an easy one, it can be watched after a couple of drinks or a few joints.
A bunch of great actors summoned to play in the new and unpredictable movie created by Jim Jarmusch.
Everyone accepted most probably because there were a few bucks and some free drinks involved and of course because it was signed by the great Jim Jarmusch :)
The plot is about some small town inhabitants who wake up all of a sudden that they attacked by zombies.
So they start gathering all sort of ""instruments"" to defend themselves and start killing them on a great country music sounding in the background.
Until some point they are lucky because the undead are moving incredible slowly so they have time for maneuver and may cut a few heads faster than the attackers.
Adam Driver uses a machete, which turns to be not so sharp as Tilda Swinton's samurai sword who looks like a real professional when it comes to cut a few heads.
The movie probably deserves a 4, but I rated it with a 6 just because of the professional shooting and the night scenes.

I loved the homage to the late, great FZ, with the town name and half the motto: ""Centerville, A Real Nice Place,"" but what was left out was not only the 2nd half of the motto (""to raise your kids up"") but the most biting bit of satire from that section of Zappa's script for 200 Motels: The irony of the proximity of ""Churches..."" to ""...liquor stores."" I was hoping to see this proximity, perhaps through the police cruiser windows, but alas, it wasn't there. There was deadpan humor, some decent effects, and Swinton's performance was great. The letdown comes with what appears to be the central moral theme of the film, which is the condemnation of consumerism. It's not that the message is wrong. I simply find it off-putting when it's delivered by rich people. Perhaps if free screenings were held, it would seem less hypocritical, but I've not heard of any.

With Tilda Swinton, Chloe Sevigny and Selena Gomez! It should be the most fun-filled zombie comedy since Zombieland, right? Unfortunately, and this is a big, capital UNFORTUNATELY, no. The trailer was more interesting than the movie, and even that itself was just average.The movie starts off really slow, as if it wants you to invest in the lives of the characters, and shows us the various townsfolk we know will eventually turn into zombies, because that's what happens when they try to get us interested in totally boring character. By the time the zombies appear, in batches, by the way, not all at once, you could be forgiven for having grabbed a quick shut-eye.These are slow-moving, George Romero type zombies, except that there are just a few of them and you could literally avoid them if you walked quickly and smartly. Yet, everybody seems to get bitten, there is a really stupid stand-off in a cemetery where Bill Murray and Adam Driver don't even try and escape, but instead try and face the zombies head on, only for them to get bitten and die. Add to this, a totally meaningless character played by Tilda Swinton who seems to be have an idea of what the zombies are, only for her to get beamed up (in a beam-me-up-Scotty way) into a UFO that just appears out of nowhere, for no reason.The first signs of the movie being silly (and not in a good way) is when Adam Driver says to Bill Murray that the reason the song on the radio sounds familiar is because it is the theme song. Yes, there was even a pathetic attempt to break the fourth (or fifth or whatever) wall by making them aware that they are in a movie. And at the end, when Bill asks Adam how he knew it wasn't going to end well, he gets the reply ""Because I read the script"". To which Bill says ""What? They only gave me my role. I didn't even get the full script.""There are a few, inventive jokes, but they only highlight what an entertaining movie this could have been, instead of the anti-climatic, boring drag it turns out to be. Adam Driver with a Star Wars keychain, for example, a nod to his role in the franchise, the zombies carrying phones, looking for WiFi signal, Steve Buscemi's overt right-wing tendencies and so on. Even the presence of the great Bill Murray only heightens the sense of disappointment in this movie because I was expecting so much.

But the single star rating is not justified.The dialogue is witty and doesn't follow the same tropes that have infestated movies of the past yearsThere is a lot of time to let each scene settle inNo character takes him or herself fully serious and that's great, they all got some whacky qualitiesThere is no single hero who saves the day, it feels like all characters get pretty equal screen-timeSeveral likeable actors everbody should recognize from other moviesAnd a successful integration of modern tech into a distinctly backwater-countryside environment.I like this movie because it is not like your average zombie movie and the subtle humor hits the right buttons.

Tom Waites performance is completely wasted. The director is to blame for such a lazy effort. There's no urgency once the actors find out about the zombies. There's stupidly written characters ( the female police officer that throws herself into a crowd of flesh eaters). How bout Steve Buscemi?

404,FelixisaJerk,"In the town of Centerville, USA (population 768), everything moves a little slower, even the apocalypse.",8,14 June 2019,"The Dead Don't DieCinema 21, Portland, ORPreview showing 6/13
What if we made a zombie movie where no one really cares that there are zombies? A sort of dull, apathetic acceptance to the horrific and odd world events happening around them. Legendary director Jim Jarmusch gave me pretty much exactly what I thought he would--an un-deadpan (ha ha) black comedy with an all-star cast: Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton, Steve Buscemi, Tom Waits, Chloe Savigny, and a slew of other cameos I won't spoil here.
In the town of Centerville, USA (population 768), everything moves a little slower, even the apocalypse. When citizens realize the sun isn't setting, people start talking. Radio reports come in about electricity failures and other oddities taking place globally; even the head of the Power and Energy Board comes on air to assure us all that these crazy events have ""absolutely nothing to do with the increase of ice fracking.""
It's a nice little message from Jarmusch; the message rolls into something a little more personal, as when the undead return, we see them going back to ""the things they did in life."" We see ghouls holding cell phones they can't use, muttering ""wi-fi"" and ""facebook."" Undead children looking for toys and candy. Zombified soccer moms practicing tennis. Undead dads flocking to tool stores. It plays to a larger theme of mindless consumption--cheeky, albeit effective.
I feel like critics and audiences aren't going to go crazy for this right off the bat; this is a slow burner, deliberately paced, unflinchingly sincere in its presentation, unwavering in its self-awareness, and steadfast in its brazen humor. You'll know what I mean if and when you see it. I think Jim Jarmusch is a great writer, and the banter he creates will be quoted between friends as inside jokes 10 years from now. It's 100% a cult film in the making.
In a time where multiplexes are filled with Avengers and Wicks and Dark Phoenixes, mammoth sized films with astonishing budgets and record breaking box office returns, it was refreshing to see a flick that was just as aware as the audience that it didn't need to be made. Though I am glad it was.",The Dead Don't Die

Other zombie movies made those statements in a more subtle, clever way.

The script is absolutely terrible and how they got such A list talent involved is beyond me, maybe they agreed before they read the script?I read some of the reviews here and had serious doubts before watching it but with Bill Murray/zombies I obviously hoped for some pale shade of Zombieland that might have a few laughs and some good zombie kills but it failed to deliver entirely. It's actually annoyingly bad, Bill Murray/Adam Driver keep breaking the 'fourth wall' and talking about aspects of the film like the soundtrack and script but it just doesn't work and becomes annoying.I watched the first 15 minutes and thought ok it's boring and no laughs yet but it must get better.....it honestly doesn't.

418,bwallarab,A politically driven meta-mess,2,1 July 2019,"Jim Jarmusch has very strong feelings about Trump supporters, global warming, fracking, family border separations, black incarceration, and capitalism. Squeezing this commentary within the narrative of a lazy zombie film, with about as much subtlety as a shotgun blast to the head, is an odd choice. It would seem Jarmusch has little love for the genre, essentially offering banal zombie tropes with no new insights or perspective, so one might ask why he went this route. Perhaps to simply see a Trump supporter eaten alive by zombies was enough of an incentive for him. Given his deeply progressive values, it seems odd that the two female leads offer little beyond stereotypes: one being presented merely as eye candy, the other becoming hysterical and paralyzed in the face of the zombie apocalypse. The one bad-ass female (played by Tilda Swinton) ended up being an alien who escapes the end of the world on a flying saucer (yes, this happens), so she doesn't count.There is the typical Jarmuschian dry wit, however without the wit. The meta-components felt weird and out-of-place (Jarmusch is no dan Harmon). When Jarmusch is at his best, his films cling to you like a warm memory, but when they miss, boy they can really stink.""The Dead Don't Die"" cannot hope to favorably compare to his brilliant ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" which should be an honored mainstay of the vampire film cannon if it is not already.

I rewatched the trailer again and decided to rent it off amazon. With most trailers what you get is what you see. That is not really this case with this one.This film starts off slowly and now that i think about it, it never really gets going. We are introduced to a range of townspeople besides the main three leads, who are all kind of different from one another but just when we get to know them suddenly they just turn up dead or, as adam drivers character repeats, undead.The humour is dead pan which works quite well throughout the film between Murray, Driver, and Sevigny but there arent any laugh out loud moments.The only real action shots are with Tilda Swintons character but they are randomly spaced around the run time so we never get a really epic sequence. There are other odd areas within this film including three kids who are in some kind of school/orphanage (not even sure what its supposed to be) whose storyline doesnt go anywhere. After the credits roll you realised 'what happened to those guys?'. And believe me, thats the even the weirdest part of the movie - you'll understand if you watch it.Overall, the comedy is alright if you like deadpan kind of humour but the story and pacing is a real problem here. I'm sure its supposed to be satirical or parody for the most part but the film never really quite pulls it off. There are better zombie, or even zombie comedies out there. 4/10",The Dead Don't Die

450,markusibbetson,A zombie film with a difference,7,24 August 2020,"I didn't know what to expect when I watched this film (I'd only vaguely heard of it), but I was pleasantly surprised by it.
It's has subtle comedy in it and does not rely on toilet humour like a lot of modern films. Instead it relys on ordinary people in odd situations, the repetition of one line by different characters and fourth wall breaks.
For a zombie movie, the gore isn't high. Yes there is some gore when the zombies eat people, but when the zombies are hacked apart or shot there's no gratuitous gore, but black smoke/dust instead, which makes a nice change.
It has an interesting take on what causes the zombie outbreak (the Earth being pushed off its natural axis by polar fracking).
The zombies retaining small parts of their former lives and repeating one or two words associated with that life adds to the comedy. It even pokes fun at people becoming zombies by being on their phones all the time, by having a bunch of zombies still trying to use their phones.
The rather random and inexplicable scene of Tilda Swinton's character being whisked off by aliens didn't spoil the movie (though it easily could've done).
The fourth wall breaks were used just the right amount, with the best one being Adam Driver and Bill Murray's characters talking about reading the script.
The Dead Don't Die isn't a laugh a minute comedy horror, but it was something different and overall an enjoyable film (especially if you don't expect too much).",The Dead Don't Die

My description: if Jim Jarmusch made a zombie movie, this would be it.Wait. That's exactly what it is.Bill Murray stars as the town police chief Cliff and Adam Driver as one of his officers, Ronnie. Peppered in are other great actors we know from everywhere. Zombies. Dialogue. Political commentary. Awkwardness. Everything we would expect from this director.And I had fun with it. I really can't stand politics in my movies, but I had some fun with this one. I managed to tune it out, maybe because I expected it to be that way.Some really funny moments, and great lack of emotion and awkward moments from all in the cast. Very self aware and meta approach to the subject matter.I loved the theme music, and love when the theme music ties in with the title or theme of the movie. Maybe I'm a sucker for cheesy stuff like that, but sometimes I miss when movies used to do that all of the time.This movie isn't for everyone, that's for sure.

496,madahab,A wasted opportunity,2,5 November 2021,"When I heard that Jim Jarmusch was going to take on the zombie genre I was intrigued and baffled as the genre had not produced anything of value in decades. He had previous given us an interesting take on vampires in Only Lovers Left Alive. I was hoping that he would bring something new to this genre. It had long exhausted any originality and became nothing more than a showcase for gore effects. If anyone was going to have a unique take on zombies it would be Jim Jarmusch. Alas, this hopes were quickly dashed within the first thirty minutes of the film. It was as if Jarmusch had binge watched several zombie films and thrown every possible cliche into a tired and unimaginative script. There is nothing original to be found within the story. The characters are flat and dull....even for a Jarmusch film. The only interesting character was played by Chloe Sevigny. The rest just go through the motions. As a satire on the zombie genre it falls short. It's too boring to be funny or scary. It felt like a long and expensive joke at the expense of those who are devoted fans of the Walking Dead. When the trailer dropped I was hoping the overtly humorous nature of the images were misleading and it would turn in another direction, but I gave it too much credit to be clever.

497,christianolivarez-78828,Selena Gomez,6,20 June 2019,"The Dead Don't Die. That's what we're talking about today. So this movie stars Adam Driver, Bill Murray and a bunch of other big names as well. This is. Zombie comedy where the dead begin to rise due to some lunar activity and others things as such. It's based in a small town with a small police force and Officer Ronnie Peterson (played by Adam Driver) and Chief Cliff Robertson (played by Bill Murray) go out to seek out the undead. Pretty straightforward. Alright so lets get on to it.So the trailer to this film looked great. It has kind of a dry humor feel and having this cast definitely supported that idea so i was pumped about that. Getting to the movie itself, it does have a very slow build and the conversations may seem dull to some. Now, i do not want take away from the performances of these actors because they did do very good job. I felt that the most of the scripting was where things were lacking. There's a lot of conversations/moments that occur that don't really seem to go very many places. For example, there's a couple scenes where there are these kids and it's not much, but it seems like enough screen time for it to mean something. However, it doesn't really go anywhere and if that had been cut, the overall movie probably wouldn't have changed very much.Now i know what you might be thinking. It just wasn't my type of comedy and i can see that. Maybe it's because Zombie movies are usually pretty fast paced and this was a slow burn. That may be true, but i suggest you watch it and let me know.The ending is pretty rushed i felt. As mentioned, it's a slow build and a lot of conversations, but the whole message of the movie is pretty vague and seemed kind of plopped in. Don't get me wrong, there were definitely parts that i enjoyed, but overall I'd maybe suggest waiting for this movie to come out on Redbox.

There would be no heroes, every normal human who is weird or quirky, angry, or downright boring would be affected, and there would be no happy ending. It would end the way the film does, exactly the way you would expect it to: immediate, bloody, and uneventful. It's just like every day life would be, except with zombies killing you.

The humour was tepid at best, and once Adam Driver's juvenile meta-jokes arrived I was rolling my eyes.The only fun in this movie was playing 'spot the celebrity cameo' and identify the zombie trope being poorly spoofed. I had no clue what Tilda Swinton's Scottish-sounding, Zelda-ish, samurai alien was supposed to be about.The whole thing comes off as an exercise in improv by bunch of actors, none of whom are very good at it.

This film brings absolutely nothing new to the table, its a careless and redundant collection of zombie clichés. It's really a shame because all the actors are excellent (especially Swinton and Muray), but it's so drab even their performances can't save the film. The few touches of absurdity barely manage to make the film worthwhile. This movie is so unbelievably flat and unoriginal that I can't really write about it...it just feels careless through and through, a great disservice to the actor's performances. It really feels like Jarmusch just wanted to do a zombie film for the heck of it.

But adding the spooky elements to such a perfect cast of people made the horror involved just downright hilarious. I really enjoyed the characters, their relationships and the awareness that zombies were what were causing the rampage in Centerville and the rest of the world.

Even with the all star cast...they couldn't save this steaming turd of a movie.
Both Tilda Swinton's character (Zelda Winston) and Tom Waits' character (Hermit Bob), had no point in the movie. You could have taken them both out and it would have changed nothing.
And with as slow and shambling as the zombies in that small town were, my mom and I could have taken them out ourselves with a couple of baseball bats, but two cops with real weapons couldn't?
Who spends all kinds of time boarding up the front door of their own store they've run for 20 years, but ""forgets"" they have a back door as well?

The first is a typical Jim Jarmusch-ian slice-of-life drama where the characters wander through their everyday existence at a slow and meditative pace. The second is a standard zombie apocalypse where everybody's life turns upside down and they have to fight for survival. The third is a meta-movie that ridicules itself and cinema in general by having Bill Murray and Adam Driver talk about the script, and then proceeding with a ludicrous finale that involves aliens. The fourth is a Jean-Luc Godard-esque sermon on environmentalism and materialism. None of the parts excels in itself, but taken together they make for an appealing whole.",The Dead Don't Die
536,alexryn,Pretty neat if you get it,8,22 July 2019,"No, I don't mean this grand speech of Tom Waits towards the end. It's actually the opposite of what you're supposed to get. Kinda. What I mean is: this is a gag-movie. One giant gag by master-director Jim Jarmusch. Needless to say I love him. Have watched all he's done and I'm fond of each and every work of his.
This one here I've just checked out in my home-city theatre. And it's kinda different from everything else he'd done before. Not that all his other films were the same, no - it's just that this one stands out. I didn't mention Tom Waits' speech just like that by the way. To not get into any spoilers: it was too straightforward and too simple. Suspiciously so.
You can get either impressed or annoyed by it, but both those cases are due to lack of sense of humour on your part. I don't mean there is no point to the movie either. There are actually lots of those here. Ecology, politics, existentialism of our modern way of life. But guess what? To see it you don't have to HEAR it. I mean when I heard that speech I at first was disappointed but then it occurred to me: ""Hey, it's Jarmusch for god sake!"" When did he ever do it? When did he choose to sit in front of his audience and try to tell us what's right and what's wrong? He was never a moralizer. No, sir. This guy is one of the greatest artists, esthetes and storytellers in the modern independent cinema.
So after thinking about it for quite some time it becomes clear. This movie is a gag. Witty, a bit tragic and hilarious one. It's also atmospheric, full of references, some forth wall breaks and parody. Simply put it, ask yourself: why would such a director shoot smth so trendy, ostentatious and unoriginal as zombie-genre movie when he is historically arthouse and indie author? For the lolz of course!
P.S.: it's also debatable whether a good jest should be funny (ha-ha) or it has a different goal. Like for instance confuse you a bit after screening. (Andy Kaufman style). Concept aside, great actors, cool visuals, pleasant atmosphere, great style and music.",The Dead Don't Die

Unfortunately what I found was a bag of reasonably good ideas that would make for good sketches in a TV comedy show, glued together by far too much weak filler.
Bill Murray plays the part of the seen-it-all, unflappable local sheriff very well sherriff(he's made for the part). Tilda Swinton was equally born to be far-out-of-left-field strange character, and does so very well. But they just don't have enough material to work with.
The film does make some nice swipes are current political themes, but they are almost lost. Subtle is good, but distracted and unfocused isn't.

I actually have no idea why these people agreed to star in it. The only smile I cracked through the whole thing was at the very end when Bill Murray says he hasn't read the script because I thought nobody had and that was the reason why they agreed to participate.The biggest regret is it should have worked, the movie has everything good director, an all star amazing cast, environmental massage, zombies, breaking of the fourth wall, its supposed to be a comedy... but everything was done horribly wrong. I refuse to acknowledge the movie had any satirical value cos it just didn't.Now the story:
It all starts with the information that because of some commercial work by the energy companies in the arctic circle the earth's rotation has changed and because of it daylight is longer which for some reason leads to zombies. what???
We are watching events in the small town where two policeman just walk around extremely slowly, talk extremely slowly and act even slower.
You cannot even enjoy the twists in the movie because nobody and I mean nobody in the movie is affected by anything
I think it took lots and lots of work from the director to make these great actors act so badly. Well done!!! :DSimply put don't waste your time, this movie is literally nothing, I honestly believe all these people just laughed at us and made up a hoax that they made a movie!!!Horrible script, Horrible acting, Stupid ending, Not a single interesting or funny moment whatsoever. Just not worth the time spent!",The Dead Don't Die

562,aaronadoty,A low-key B-movie homage for the Trump era,7,11 July 2021,"The Dead Don't Die adds nothing to the thoroughly played-out zombie apocalypse genre, but it reads as a tender homage to over 70 years of B movies set in small town America, from the sci-fi thrillers of the 50s to the po-mo zombie comedies of the new century. It also gives Jim Jarmusch an excuse to pack in a whole bunch of his favourite players and have some gentle fun with them, in a typically downbeat way. The most enjoyable parts of the movie are the interactions between small groups of characters on the sidelines of, or gaps between, what passes for the main 'action'. There's a lot of tongue-in-cheek and 4th-wall breaking dialogue, and some pretty heavy-handed musing about the demise of truth and the shallow obsessions of late-stage capitalism. None of this stops the enjoyment of watching the excellent cast comfortably inhabit their genre stereotypes as they move through a series of gorgeous locations that represent the distilled essence of the 'small town with strange going's on' cinematic trope.",The Dead Don't Die

A pointless, non credible story line. If it was funny then the comic genius was beyond me, as it was hidden in a script my 9 year old could have written.The budget was so low I expected to see power extension leads being dragged across the set. If it had a bigger budget, then the Director spent it getting hammered in his trailer.One of the most shocking examples of an accomplished and esteemed cast coming together to create a real master turd.

You have to be a Star Wars fan to enjoy the Kilo Ren jokes. I enjoyed some of them but throughout the movie I wasn't sure what the writers wanted to convey. It's as if they got random thoughts from many people and just implement the ideas randomly without thinking it through. Most likely I just didn't get the jokes. I heard a small group of audience laugh sometimes and I'm sure I missed something related to some other movie.

Zombies invade a small town (pop. 768, but built up considerably more than such a small populace would warrant) while Tom Waits takes the place of a Greek chorus. Bill Murray and Adam Driver are the local law enforcement officers who never seem particularly phased by what is happening. They occasionally make reference to the fact that they're in a movie, though, so I guess that makes sense? Zombies wander aimlessly, looking for things they had in their lives, like coffee, free WiFi, and candy, but there are far more corpses of recent vintage than such a minute town could possibly produce. There are also some very weak attempts at social commentary, with references to the racism of MAGA and consumer culture.

If you're that guy, check your pulse as you might be one of the zombies featured in this film.It's not cerebral or intellectual, but the pacing and the ""point"" reminds me much of other recent films like Annihilation, The Arrival, or A Quiet Place.There isn't a lot of dialogue. It isn't witty. It isn't action packed. I'm not sure it's supposed to be.Which is all interesting considering the bulk of reviewers I've read about the film. The actors seemed to have believed in it enough to take part. Not sure if that says anything. But I think these actors, one in particular, knows a thing or two about a ""funny"" zombie flick. I have to think that is because this show isn't meant to be ""that kind"" of flick.Some things in life have no meaning. Sometimes evaluating such meaningless things is the whole point of an activity.

Honestly I think the reason the whole thing moved so dreadfully slow is because they had to find a way to fill 90 minutes. Watch the thing at 1.5x normal playback speed, and maybe the high-pitched voices and better pacing will make it salvageable.",The Dead Don't Die
627,vonfidde,One of the worst movies ever,1,9 September 2019,"Still some bad movies can be fun, but thats not the case for this one.

629,blametaker77,Slight of the Living Dead,8,22 June 2019,"The Dead Don't Die marks the first wide release for the impossibly cool Jim Jarmusch who has been doing his thing (Down by Law, Mystery Train, Broken Flowers, etc.) for over 30 years. That said, make no mistake, this is no mainstream zombie movie. Consider this review fair warning for all you psuedo-horror aficionados out there who saw Zombieland and assume so adorably that you know the lengths to which the genre can be taken. In actuality, you have no clue, and here's your cinematic wake up call. This is one brazenly bizarre, fourth wall busting, utterly gonzo experience that is as much a ""thank you"" to the masters (namely Romero) as it is a "" screw you"" to the masses (namely hipsters). I personally love The Dead Don't Die and highly recommend it knowing full well it is one long agonizing deadpan joke (pun intended) that will make many squirm in their seat, and not for the reason you'd expect. B+",The Dead Don't Die
630,jcmadsen-2,It ain't Zombieland or Shaun of the Dead,2,16 December 2020,"I suffered through this so you didn't have to.1) This movie is an hour and 45 minutes. About 20 min too long, not as if editing it for time would have improved it.
2) You know how ever since Pacino won an AA for his role in Scent of a Woman, every subsequent role he's had as been some form of LtCol Frank Slade? That's Bill Murray. He's the same guy from Lost In Translation every time.
3) There is this foreshadowing in an early scene where Murray and Driver are in their squad car (they are two of the three cops, along with Sevigny, in the town of Centerville) and listening to ""The Dead Don't Die"" by Sturgill Simpson. He, and this song, will come up repetitively throughout the movie. Murray asks why are they listening to this. Driver responds ""it's the theme song"". I would have turned it off then if I had caught the meaning.
4) Tom Waits plays a hermit in the forest. He walks around muttering about how things seem weird. He watches the zombies come through binoculars. He never engages beyond that.
5) Steve Buscemi gets a chicken stolen. He wears a MAGA type hat that says ""Keep America White Again""(?). His dog runs away. He sees his cows leave. Zombies come to his door and he kills a couple. And, that's it. That's all he does. He shows up in the final graveyard scene as a zombie.
6) RZA stops by a small gas station as a UPS (well, it's not UPS; it's a brown truck with something like WVPS. He's on screen for less than 2 minutes. He drives away. Later, he's a zombie in the same gas station.
7) There are 3 kids at a juvenile detention center. They watch the weird weather events play out on TV (Rosie Perez is, for some odd reason, the broadcaster. She plays no other part than to do a couple of TV scenes). They watch out the window later on. They escape when the zombies invade the center. They have a scene outside later on. That's it.
8) Selena Gomez and two male friends are driving across PA. They stop for gas. She flirts with the dorky guy behind the counter. She buys the Sturgill Simpson song on CD. They check into a motel. The cops happen to be there. Murray, Driver and the motel manger leer at her. She gets snacks. She has a couple of scenes where she walks away in tight shorts. She and her friends watch the weird events that are occurring on TV. Next time we see them, they're dead. That's it (other than Driver chopping her head off and holding it up by the hair).
9) Carol Kane is in an early scene. She's dead. Is her corpse in the morgue? Nope. It's in a cell at the police station, rotting until the next morning when it's due to be picked up. She becomes a zombie later on when Murray, Driver and Sevigny are at the station. Driver cuts her head off. That's that. (Mind you, none of this is done Walking Dead or Zombieland style. It just happens, in a dry, black comedy manner, but it's not funny or amusing).
10) Tilda Swinton plays...wait for it...Zelda Winston. I'm surprised her first name wasn't Dilta. She's weird, is the new owner of the funeral home, has a dojo in back and wields a samurai sword like The Bride and Marchonne. She has a Scottish accent. She uses the police radio/computer to summon aliens to come take her home. This is supposed to be funny.
11) Oh, and Driver gives Swinton his car keys. There is an Imperial Cruiser key chain. She mentions Star Wars and how she likes it. Driver says something like ""yeah, it's good'. Again, this is supposed to elicit a laugh.
12) Iggy Pop is the first zombie we see, half hour into the movie. Oddly, he isn't wearing any zombie make up for his scene (HiYO!).
13) Oh, cutting off a zombie head makes this black smoke appear and the zombie dies.
14) So, after 90 minutes of just scenes and people and nothing really meshing; scenes where the three cops drive around; where no one is banding together to find a solution, we get the money shot. Murray asks Driver why he continually throughout the movie says ""this isn't going to end well."" Driver replies ""it's in the script"" You gotta be kidding. Murray says something like ""you've seen the whole script? I only got our pages."" I'm paraphrasing. Murray makes a comment about how he's always been so good to Jim (presumably a reference to the director). Then, they get out of the car, kill as many zombies as possible, until they are finally overtaken. The end.",The Dead Don't Die

It's as if the director was tasked in ruining it. Every single story arc is either cut short, ruined or simply abandoned.I'm fine with budget, niche movies as they often have a interesting message or journey that lingers in your brain for a while.
This was the antithesis of that. As if the message was the film, genre and world is pointless. I don't mean nihilism, but literal, technical pointlessness.Maybe this film is a world is where actors go to die?
All the actors that have forced their childish politics on us will eventually find themselves trapped in a boring, aimless movie in which to suffer a brutal, meaningless death. And no amount of cheap, cringeworthy 4th-wall breaks will save them.

Characters repeating the same things over again in an attempt to produce humour - epic fail.Finally a Zombie appears and you think, here we go at last, this is when the film manages to somehow transcend from being plain boring, to boring, ridiculous and stupid all at the same time. I don't mean stupid in a funny way.I didn't laugh at one single point. The best bit of the film was when the end credits finally came up. How anyone is giving this a rating over 4 is unbelievable to me.I had no idea who Jim Jarmusch was until today, now I know that he is a terrible Director and luckily I will never watch any film by him ever again.",The Dead Don't Die

The only horror you will experience is knowing it's 2 hours of insipid dialogue and meandering plot.I assume Bill Murray and co sat down together and did a read through of the script, surely alarm bells should have rang when corny punchlines were responded to with dry coughs from somewhere in the distance.With the market completely saturated with zombie films you wanna come out swinging and all this is is a borefest, what a dud.

The pace was slow and the movie was just to long.
There's a few times when the cast refer to things as being in a movie, the first time is them Chief Robertson and Officer Paterson and driving in their patrol car and the Chief is asking why the song on the radio is so familiar and Paterson says its the theme song of the movie.
Characters enter the story for no reason, for instance 3, 20somethings drive into town and end up dead, we don't see them attacked or anything, pointless characters that brought nothing to the story.
We are introduced to some kids held in a juvenile detention building, what for? who knows, they bring nothing to the story and the last we see of them is running off screen because they know somewhere safe. Pointless characters and waste of film.Zelda Winston the towns new mortician is very strange, she can wave her hands over the police damaged computer and radio and they suddenly spring back to life, she then writes some computer code before heading to the graveyard where she is beamed up by a flying saucer!!!!!
Back in the police car Chief Robertson and Officer Paterson are talking and Robertson askes Paterson why he keeps saying ""this wont end well?"" Well its because he read it in the script.
This movie is not well written enough or funny enough to poke fun at itself and I was just irritated by them.
I didn't care what happened to these people, to much time was spent on pointless characters that brought nothing to the story.
A zombie movie needs to be 1 of 2 things, it has to be funny or it has to be gory, and this was neither.
To long, to boring, to irritating, a little to weird and utterly pointless.",The Dead Don't Die

I think it's an acquired taste, but I personally enjoyed it. It's gonna be a hit-or-miss, for sure.The cast is excellent, led by a sassy Bill Murray and a hilariously blank Adam Driver.Bill and Adam are a great duo. They work off each other very well, and I would love to see more from them in the future.Steve Buscemi, Danny Glover, and Caleb Landry Jones also stand out in smaller performances. I also love the cameo from RZA and the Wu-PS truck.I see a few people bashing the three child actors' story arch, but I thought it was fine. There were some great scenes between the three.The gore isn't throughout the film, but when it pops up, the effects look great.

You are supposed to laugh at usage of the same line thats repeated over and over until the last person rolls his eyes in agony. Sarcastic remarks are made to hit the audience over the head with the absurdity of the situation, thrown in with some blunt 4th wall breaking. Nothing works, not even the acting. While the main cast is supposed to be almost apathic at the outbreak of a zombie apacolypse, it geniuely kills the mood and every sense of drama or tension. After this you will wonder if Adam Driver cant really act and Bill Murray was high or thinking about his paycheck the while time.There are no pay-offs to character arcs and they push some weird social commentary over the cause of the outbreak thats so mindnumbingly obvious and in your face it loses all weight, plus voice-over to really hammer home the fact how humans where zombie-like to begin with on how they consume and want ever more.

663,megamatt-80194,Going on my guilty pleasure list,6,12 May 2020,"This is an interesting film. While I certainly had an expectation of what it would be upon going in, (since I had already viewed Paterson), I didn't know it would be Jarmusch's attempt to make a mainstream film.The comedy is as dry as the Sahara. If you don't like quick witted humor and dry delivery when it comes to jokes, this film will either annoy or bore you. I thought most of the jokes in the film landed, but that's mostly because of my love for dry humor.Also, Jarmusch attempts to pay homage and spoof B-movies as well as George Romero's Living Dead Trilogy, and in some cases he delightfully succeeds. In others, it comes from nowhere and ends up as nothing. His attempts to be mainstream, especially with the use of 4th wall breaking can miss horrifically, and can land pretty well in some instances.Overall, I'm split by this film. The horror fan and comedy fan inside of me loved this film, and the critic side saw that it was full of mistakes and miscalculations. I'm giving it a six instead of a straight five simply because this film has an innocent charm to it. Let me explain.It feels like the kind of film to watch with friends on Halloween night. A film that instead of making you think, is a purely reactive experience. It brought back feelings of watching Night of The Living Dead, and it really made me remember why I love horror as a genre so much. The cast and crew definitely had fun making it, and it's easy to see within the film. Honestly, the worst crime a film can commit, even with mistakes, is to be boring. And The Dead Don't Die never bored me, but instead made me laugh and have a fun time at the cinema.Is it perfect? No. Definitely not. It has problems with tone, has loose ends within the plot, and it's humor can sometimes impact the quality of the plot itself, (plus, if you're not a fan of gore, this film lingers on gore many times for laughs). But it's not boring, and it's got a quick witted, quirky sense of style and humor. It had good intentions, and I commend Jarmusch for trying something new.It's a guilty pleasure for me, and is destined to become a cult film. I love it, but it's definitely not a great movie. It's a good one at best. And that's okay.",The Dead Don't Die

Some of the attempts at ""jokes"" were so bad, such as the repetition of ""wild animals, or pack"", or whatever they said, as it's long been erased from my memory, as I expect the rest to be in another hour or so.If it wasn't for the fact that this is heavily weighted by a very good cast it would fall even harder on its ass.

680,DrVankman,«Star bullying: Revenge on the audience»,4,6 September 2019,"The Dead Don't Die - this is a unique movie. With a cool trailer, cool actors, a funny seeming interpretation of the appearance of zombies in an adequate real world. A kind of comedic thrasher. So you think going to the movie after watching the trailers. And there...
And there, guys, I would call the film... «Star bullying: Revenge on the audience.» This is the most true, perhaps. You can imagine that a team of excellent actors has been assembled, on which a huge number of spectators will buy and go to the movies. As a big fan of Ghostbusters and Predator 2, I try not to miss any single movie featuring Bill Murray and Danny Glover. But what I saw this time really disappointed. Even the idea of the film it is not new by itself, it is worthy of attention, but the script and direction of the film are stupid to madness. Screenwriter and Director Jim Jarmusch worked on the script is such a way that he didn't bother writing a script at all. From the word at all. The whole film, the characters live very mundane and unemotional, despite what is happening around the apocalypse invented on the idea. The jokes in the movie are the absence of jokes. Well, like the hero said melancholy «this whole thing is gonna end badly» - and this is very funny according to the author's idea. So much so that the joke will be repeated 500 times. In general, in the film ""humorous"" the repetition of the same thing is almost a key feature.
About an hour is spent only on introducing the viewer to all the characters in the film, and the director does not make any attempts to establish a plot between them.
The script and plot are absent completely and in general. So much so that the characters seem already know that the film is worthless because already read the script. Seriously? And all this against the background of incredibly stupid senseless as if smart sayings about something incomprehensible, but uttered with such intonation as if it was something important. Moreover, the storyline of some characters is either so absurd that you even think who invented this nonsense, or disappears without a trace.
In fact, the film is unbearably excruciatingly slow and boring. Yes, there are a lot of good actors in the film, but the impression is that this is literally acting revenge on the audience for everything bad, but I don't know why. With such emphasis and arrogance, the scriptwriter mocks the audience who came to the hall. I, like many others, bought the ticket because of actors and good trailer. Expected comedic horror in the style of Welcome to Zombieland. Here is not a film, but an absurd vision of the director and an absurd script.
As a result - a fair 1 of 10 for the script and direction of the film! And only of respect for Bill Murray and Danny Glover, I put 5. Keep yourself out to watch this movie in the cinema.",The Dead Don't Die
681,j_michelle-20510,"Slow, boring, predictable",2,28 July 2021,"Movie started off OK, waited for excitement that would never come from lead actors that showed no emotion of any kind. The scenes were slow and dragged out with pointless dialogue and irrelevant actions. Incorporating a couple B list actors to terminate their roles so predictably- why bother? They could have been excluded and it would not have effected the movie in any way. The ending made no sense. Blood was more realistic -being dry. Lots of cliché moments of 'no don't do that the zombies will get you'. And the repetition of the title song over and over almost made me think the movie was created to promote the song!",The Dead Don't Die
682,melinapaz,Simple and Clear,9,15 July 2019,"People got so used to the expensive sci-fi movies that they have lost all their sense of humor and the value of good actors/actresses. This movie is well played by all the actors and actresses in it. Tilda Swinton is the best!

683,sketchpoetjon,A Very Hard Watch,3,1 August 2019,"Okay...firstly let me say that the trailer made this look like a Great Zombie Comedy. I feel very let down to be honest. Whilst I did laugh for the first 15 mins and especially loved the initial breaking of the fourth wall it didn't take long thereafter for it to become hard to watch. I found it very slow, boring as and no longer funny. It's my understanding now after doing a bit of research that this is suppose to be an attempt at deadpan humour but I mean come on people. Aubrey Plaza does deadpan humour and she is great but this movie just fails to impress me. At one point i paused the film to check how long was left and there was only 15 mins. So i decided to stick with it, mainly because homeboy kept saying "" this is going to end badly"" and i wanted to see how it was going to end. I did chuckle again towards the end when Mr. Driver said "" I read the script, that's how i know it's going to end badly"" And the UFO part was completely off the wall and unexpected. In conclusion, this is not Bill Murrays best work, it is certainly not Adams time to shine and Tilda Swinton should definitely know better. Best advice, don't waste 100 mins of your time on this.",The Dead Don't Die
684,tool-man,Great Film,9,31 October 2019,"I liked this film very much. Look at the cast!! Fantastic actors in almost every role. Tom Waits and Tilda Swinton are just gorgeous.
It's funny with a good sense of dry humor. The story can be seen as bitter sweet satire and social criticism.
It is not at all a typical zombie movie, like Romero, 28 days/weeks later, Zombieland, ...
I assume many of the people who gave bad rewiews, wanted to see something like this.

688,krgunn,Beyond boring and stupid,1,21 March 2021,"My girlfriend has HBO+, so on ""date night"" yesterday evening we decided to watch The Dead Don't Die. We didn't know anything about the movie, but we assumed with such an excellent cast it had to be decent. Boy, were we wrong. Before I get lectures from Jim Jarmusch fans, I've seen some of his other movies and have enjoyed them.The Dead Don't Die gives an entirely new meaning to the word ""boring."" Slow-paced is one thing, stupefyingly dull is another. The wooden acting from some of my favorites doesn't help, but very, very little happens in the movie, and when it does, the action is pretty boring and predictable, too. People sit around, stand around, and drive around with expressionless faces mouthing pointless expository dialog even though there's not much to expose. The scenery is pretty, which is about the only positive.The environmentalist and anti-consumerism message is heavy-handed and pretty stupid. While I would normally agree with such a message, I didn't like being bludgeoned about the head with it, and it's handled in such a haphazard and nonsensical way it certainly isn't going to change any minds. The concept of the Earth tilting off its axis is interesting if utterly implausible, and there is absolutely no follow-through. A kid in a detention facility (I think; little is clear in this movie) mentions to a couple of fellow detainees that the Earth going off it's axis would destroy the world, which I imagine is correct, but the only effects the characters experience is that it gets dark later. Well, that and the zombies. And the moon looks peculiar.We probably should have turned it off early in the movie when the song ""The Dead Don't Die"" comes on the radio while Bill Murray and Adam Driver are cruising around in their police car. The Murray character wonders aloud why it sounds familiar. The Driver character says it's because it's the movie's theme song. Cringe. Even worse, toward the end, Murray's character asks Driver's character why he's been saying ""It's not going to end well"" throughout. Driver's character says it's because he's read the script. Double cringe. There are ways to break the fourth wall in a clever manner, but in The Dead Don't Die it's merely embarrassing.I love Tom Waits, and he does as well as he can with his part as the hermit, but to me his character seemed tacked on as an afterthought, as if Jarmusch decided he needed an observer to make pithy remarks about mankind's flaws.I really, really wanted to like this movie, and my girlfriend and I watched it until the end expecting something interesting to happen. Unfortunately, nothing ever does. At one point about halfway through my girlfriend asked, ""Do you have any idea where this movie is going? Is everyone going to die?"" I yawned and said, ""I really don't know.""The Dead Don't Die seems like a ""screw you"" to the audience from Jarmusch, kind of like when the great Lou Reed, freaked out by his sudden popularity, released ""Metal Machine Music."" If you're not old enough to remember that, Google it.I'm embarrassed for all the excellent actors involved in this boring mess. Maybe it looked better on paper than on film. I strongly recommend everyone avoid The Dead Don't Die unless you're having a hard time getting to sleep.",The Dead Don't Die

692,maxtiggertom,Sloppy Comedy Elevated by Murray and Driver,5,28 July 2019,"The Dead Don't Die is one of those films that has so much potential in its concept and its actors. It could easily have been a great comedy. Unfortunately, this is probably one of the most disappointing films I've seen this year. My first criticism is with the comedy itself - it just isn't that funny. The film did receive a few chuckles from me but otherwise it felt stale and quite strange. The mix of dry humour (mostly provided from Murray and Driver) and fourth wall breaks were jarring at best and at worst painfully unneeded. For example: The Dead Don't Die by Sturgill Simpson plays at the opening credits of the film and progressively throughout the film - to the point of annoyance. At some stage Murray breaks the fourth wall, commenting on this being the 'theme song'. This fell flat, was boring and in my opinion served no purpose.However, the dry humour on its own, was good. It felt as though Murray and Driver were very much committed to their roles and put a lot of effort into what they were given.There is another strange comment later in the film about the script. Driver and Murray turn to the audience and comment on their rolls in the various scenes. In my opinion it's a bizarre style of humour to use in this type of film. I felt these jokes in the film weren't needed. It just seemed lazy.Tilda Swinton is a highlight in the film as she brings much more of the good dry humour into the mix. The film somewhat squanders her potential, revealing something completely out of left field in the ending. The reveal felt incredibly unjustified and there was virtually no build up to it. This brings me to my next point - the ending. This was probably one of most boring, bland and wasteful ends to a film I think I've ever seen. It just felt to me that by that point the director Jim Jarmusch just threw everything he could think of at the wall just to see what would stick. Like a wet, pasty sponge only the worst parts appeared to stay stuck.In conclusion, I would not recommend you go to see this film in the cinema. It's an unfortunate case of wasted potential both in its premise and in its wonderful cast.2.5/5 thumbsNot Recommended",The Dead Don't Die

We're sloppy and entitled, lost and confused, zombies one and all.So, it makes sense that this movie would be lost on us.A good movie. Whimsical, boring, strange, funny. Great characters that don't go quite where you want them to. Plot-lines and arcs you expect to manifest but don't. But... That's the point. Our expectations are what drive us, make us zombies...

Everyone dies and a random Scottish lady escapes with the helps of Aliens.

Selena Gomez - says hi to a guy, buys some snacks and then is shown dead with her head cut off.Bunch of kids in CDC - they just end up running away from CDC and thats that.Bunch of business owners - They all die quickly.I honestly dont know how to review this movie.

There's also Tilda Swinton, Selena Gomez and a multitude of other characters who either feel really underused or straight up undeveloped or pointless.With a lot of other technical aspects being just okay or passable this ends up being a fun zombie flick with some great dry humour and a lot of loose ends that lead to nowhere.",The Dead Don't Die

This is definitely a movie that if you don't like it, you are going to absolutely hate it. It is very dry comedy with lots of deadpan and significant fourth wall breaking. If you don't find anything amusing in the first 10 minutes, then you should probably move on to something else.Over the top political commentary. Side stories that go absolutely nowhere and are seemingly just forgotten. Random plots events that make no sense to the rest of the movie. All things I normally hate in a movie, but this time it just works. The reason for this is a fourth wall break that you don't initially realize is a fourth wall break. Very early in the movie and throughout it, Adam Driver's character says, ""This isn't going to end well."" It isn't obvious that he's talking about the movie itself. So when all the ridiculous plot points happen and the side stories are abandoned, it is HILARIOUS because he's been telling the viewer all along that was going to happen.",The Dead Don't Die

The movie makes a lot of great political points. Climate change is bad, fracking is bad, and MAGA has wearing folk are idiots and deserve to die in a zombie apocalypse.

It was a decent watch, just don't go in expecting a serious zombie movie. The Dead don't die is Zombieland lite; a zombie comedy just not as good. The movie is pretty slow paced, no one will ever confuse it with a Avengers movie. The cast is fine and if your a fan of dry, quirky humor its actually fun. In many ways The Dead Don't Die is a throwback to George Romero's original Night of the Living Dead. It is set in small town Centerville and focuses as much on the interesting characters that inhabit the town as it does zombies. If your looking for bloodshed its pretty tame and I don't remember any nudity, if you like your horror more extreme than don't bother. There's a story here, it just takes its time developing and I'm not sure most people will be happy at how it all ends up.

The movie had very minimal laughs where I kept on believing the voice in my head saying it will get better but it did not. We also have a Scottish funeral director with OCD and practices the art of the samurai while in contact with aliens for the ending plot reveal. I would rather go shove my head in an oven with 13 screaming babies high off oxy than to think of this movie ever again. I think the only funny parts (barely) in the film was by Steve B.

The actors (all of who I appreciate very much) basically did a walk through throughout the whole film. When I first saw the big names attached and the zombie storyline, my first thought was anticipation. But about a third of the way through the film, I realized I was being played. Then my disappointment only grew and my interest withered to soon be replaced by disgust. Do not waste your time on this stupid attempt at making a zombie movie. If it was advertised as satire with comedy attached, then I wouldn't have even bothered wasting my time in the first place. But I was lead to believe otherwise.

The makeup and prostethics are also pretty good. However this movie definitely has its fair share of problem. The social commentary in this movie has no subtlety at all there are characters that are exclusively in this movie to shove it down the audiences throat and it get pretty annoying. Also at the very end the movie gets way to absurd I won't spoil the two specific things that happen but when they do you will notice it. It doesn't fit at all and is not really funny.

784,markjenkinsmedia,A VERY BAD FILM,1,1 September 2019,"Possibly one of the biggest wastes of talent ever filmed. It's possible to SEE what Jarmusch is trying to do - create a modern, hip and knowing version of the classic zombie films with large doses of black humour - but this is done in such a grotesquely heavy-handed manner that one can reasonably expect a cinema audience to sit as stony-faced throughout as most of the actors involved. For some reason Jarmusch has chosen to layer over already black humour with a large dose of deadpan humour, meaning that almost no-one reacts to anything in the zombie apocalypse plot, so whether the humour is blatantly telegraphed or not, nothing is left seeming at all funny. There are multiple references to classics such as Day of The Dead, so someone's obviously watched those in depth, but has come out learning nothing except a one-dimensional parroting of their original messages (usually delivered in voiceover, the last resort of the desperate).There are only two types of movie in the world, ones in which people talk to themselves to further the plot - ""hey now, uh, what are we gonna do about these zombies?"" - and ones in which they don't, because they're actually acting. You can't imagine James Bond stopping and asking himself ""hey uh, now, whaddarewe gonna do about these spies?"" but in Jarmusch world, people do. OK, there are excuses in which they're talking to corpses, or their cats. But the many scenes where they aren't, indicate with a heavy hand that we're in pondering (and ponderous) philosophical black humour territory.Most of the supporting roles are both ill-considered and nonsensical plot wise, Tilda Swinton's particularly, but the fact that we don't EXPECT the plot to make any sense after the first few minutes bodes ill for the remainder or the film. Around this point comes the first reference by a character to the fact that we're IN A FILM - unfortunately this is a faded joke and will not, unlike Birdman (a film acted by actors, about actors acting) and La La Land (a Hollywood film about Hollywood, and being in Hollywood) go anywhere towards earning anyone (including Bill Murray who has blatantly wanted one for some time) an Academy Award.The terribleness extends even to the music (by Jarmusch's band), dominated by the well known Jarmusch liking for Country, but slipping in the most cliched manner possible into John Carpenter and Stranger Things territory at the most obvious possible moments.Complete with throw-away ending, this movie feels like a complete waste of everyone's life - ironic, for a zombie movie. Perhaps that was the idea.",The Dead Don't Die

This is the type of film that makes people wonder if Hollywood celebrities (like Bill Murray) aren't just laughing at us as they take our money. Tilda Swinton looking like a samurai version of Edgar Winter isn't funny...it's just pathetic.

800,halaszgabor1990,"The ""not-joke"" of a zombie movie",7,21 September 2019,"Midwest, Bill Murray, zombies: How is this not another comedy gold like Zombieland?This was my first thought when I sat down watching The Dead Don't Die. But I've had to realize that considering this as a failed Zombieland-copy or Shaun of the Dead ripoff, would be just as false as considering Drive a failed Fast & Furious or Gravity a failed Star Wars.This film isn't even a zombie movie parody, it is a parody of our society. The characters themselves act like they've seen this a thousand times before, all they react with (especially Driver and Murray) is a sort of apathy and introversion. I haven't seen such consistently awkwardly behaving characters in any other movie before.The things happening around them are both tragic and surreal yet almost everybody treats them with a careless ""let's get this over with"" routine, because everyone just simply wants it to be over (the slowly passing days make everything feel even more dragging).The living people offer surprisingly little resistance when facing zombies, as if staying alive was just yet another chore. Nobody really helps anybody, they either arrive late and lament over the bodies, or simply don't help at all, just passing by as their fellow humans are getting killed.Knowledge doesn't help much either, it only helps people understand that there's not much to do.Certain elements of the movie are not simply repetitive, but almost hypnotically so, allowing the viewer to feel the same dragging the characters do.It all was a very intentional depiction of apathy and depression. A movie about a boring dystopia. Don't enjoy it. it's not intended for that. Watch, think and despair.The Dead Don't Die failed both with the critics and the cinemagoing audience, but I can clearly see it as a cult movie discovered in the near future. Not necessarily among zombie movie fans, but among people who want a whiff of the early 21st century atmosphere.",The Dead Don't Die

It is most of all boring; no suspense, no humour (there are attempts but they fail badly), no characters that are not completely one-dimensional. Plus: the movie is pretentious; it seems as if Jarmusch wanted to throw in something intellectual and had characters talking about having read the script (which is completely unmotivated and not funny) and a voice-over by a hermit which is meant (?) to lend the story some depth by commenting on capitalist society.

819,TonyWalnuts,A Film As Dry As Its Brain Dead Monsters.,8,8 September 2019,"Yuck, I truly cannot understand all the hate this film is getting. When I first caught the trailer I thought it was just a parody that would never actually become a feature film. How happy I was to discover I was wrong.I found this to be enjoyable from beginning to end, especially as I was expecting a boring snooze-fest based on the reviews I had read. What I got was a well paced zombie film with incredibly talented actors delivering utterly droll lines that I giggled at throughout. By no means would I say it was laugh out loud, and perhaps actors less talented than the superb ones here would not be able to carry it off.
Nor does the film add much new to the tried and tested zombie film format but it does have fun with the tropes and cliches of the genre. From fracking leading to Earth being knocked off its axis in the opening act to Tilda Swinton's Katana wielding Scot, it's just entertaining tomfoolery. I won't really say much about the overall plot, if you wanted spoilers you could just read the script.The trailer stated this film is ""the greatest zombie cast"" and that is just clear fact. Adam Driver is an actor I wasn't too keen on years ago but the more I see of him the more obvious his talents are. Tilda Swinton is clearly enjoying herself here and nothing more needs to be said about how good she is in everything. The same goes for Chloë Sevigny and Caleb Landry Jones, who make the most of their roles in every film no matter how small.If anybody doesnt agree perhaps we could all meet up in a wee whiley... in the cemetery :).",The Dead Don't Die

Its actually a 3 or for but that's not a good thing. This movie introduces interesting characters only for them to have absolutely no story arch. The pacing of this movie is very slow and boring. Even if this was trying to convey some sort of social commentary it fails miserably. This movie was not funny or entertaining. Like I said in the headline, the director must have called in every favor he had in order to cast so many celebs whom had massive amounts of success and or awards elsewhere. As a movie buff and a fan of zombie films, I can honestly say that this is one of the worst zombie films I've ever seen.

So if your expecting an trilling 80's style horror movie, you're gonna be disappointed because the story goes in against the Hollywood writings and there for is something only a few people gonna like.
The movie is slow, is kinda dorky and tries to make you feel uncomfortable but not in a scary way. I enjoyed it and I understand why some people don't. Still interested in watching this movie? Just try it and see for yourself and maybe you're like me.",The Dead Don't Die

I saw it for free but still paid 2 hours of my time and it wasn't worth it. This movie sucks. I agree with others. The trailer made it seem like a comedy. This movie was PAINFULLY unfunny.

Well you just stay out of its way. Okay so there are a lot of really negative reviews here. But there are also some that think there are interesting layers to this movie and that it actually has something to say. So there you are thinking about renting this movie in all your innocence thinking maybe all these negative reviews were written by folks who just didn't get it. You know that curious person who has to go down into the basement in the horror movie? That's you. And all of these negative reviews are written by people who are saying ""Don't do it!"". Don't pay good money for this movie! Don't even watch it for free! Okay, of course it's possible you'll like this movie. Obviously some people do. But my bet is that you won't, because the fact is that's really pointless and a waste of time. It's not going to stimulate your brain its going to eat it. I described this movie as unfunny, which is not exactly true. It had a couple of very mildly amusing jokes. Oh, so very, very mildly amusing. Mostly it was like watching a comedian bomb. My guess is that director Jim Jarmusch knew he had failed with this. To be successful this movie has to be funny or it has to really say something. Jim knew he failed on both accounts and that's why he tacks on a voiceover at the very end to explain what it all meant. But if the movie had any meaning he wouldn't have to spell it out. I guess he fooled some people though. Jim, I want my money back. (Oh, and your love of Bill Murray will not make you like this movie. Just say'n.)",The Dead Don't Die

846,suzi-75611,"Started really well, went downhill",4,1 April 2020,"I wasn't expecting too much from this film having seen its scores prior to watching. However, a short way through I was really wondering why it has such generally average reviews.
I LOVED the first half. It creates a great atmosphere from the word go, introducing a sleepy town and its residents, whilst news reports and mentions of sinister goings on create an ominous backdrop. It had elements of Fargo, if Fargo had zombies and Selena Gomez. I loved the Americana of it all, the tongue in cheek writing, the subtle comedy.
Unfortunately, this all fell apart in the second half, where it became meandering and the spooky atmosphere completely faltered. The introduction and revisits to completely separate characters earlier on gave me false hope that the storylines might intertwine and actually go somewhere interesting. This was where the film really fell short and I was left feeling as though some of these characters were only included to 'pad out' the script.
To say that something seems far-fetched in a supernatural film is contradictory in itself. However, a storyline is still to be upheld and is not an excuse for what I felt was lazy writing, where individual character conclusions and the overall ending just seemed like a cop-out (excuse the pun).All in all, disappointing, only because it raised my expectations high initially and squandered its opportunity to develop.",The Dead Don't Die

Really enjoyed the opening five minutes. There were some lines that just hit the funny bone, but then it stopped. It appeared the script relied too much on the actors. It seemed like a bunch of bored mates got together and said 'it's about time we made a movie together.'
The movie centred around the cops. Three cops had a whole arsenal of weapons available to them but chose one rifle and a machete and all one cop did was scream and cry - that was annoying. Two guys were baracaded in a hardware and gun emporium store. I'm thinking this is gonna be good - that scene went no where. There were several other groups of characters that said a few lines and then died in the most boring manner.
The thing about comedy zombie movies and tv shows is that the humans kill zombies in the the most heinous and funniest ways and there is all these off the cuff comments. This movie should have been up there with Shaun of the Dead, instead it just needs to be left dead and buried.",The Dead Don't Die

Who's there?,1,24 June 2021,"If Sheldon Cooper watched this movie, the lack of resolution would have driven him up the wall.If you are thinking of paying money to rent, download, or buy this movie, my recommendation is to find another film. If you want weird and provocative along with social commentary see the film, ""Bubba Ho-Tep"".The slow pace of ""The Dead Don't Die"" did not bother me. The very poor dialogue can be forgiven. If the goal was to achieve a complete lack of character development, then they were on target.And, they did tell us that the movie would not end well. The best part of the movie is that it did end. The story did not end; the film did. The storyline just died along with most of the characters. At least, they did not reanimate the characters and make us watch more in hope that it would go somewhere.There were three teens in the film who fortunately escaped; I do not know why they were in the film at all but I gather that they wisely decided to hide in the woods until filming stopped. Another character stated they could not take it anymore and let the zombies kill them. Unfortunately for them, escape was not so easy as they returned as a zombie and had to endure the continued agony that was this film.In conclusion, I did watch the entire film. I normally would have found a different movie after twenty minutes of nothing. The hook was that I could not believe that the film would go nowhere with such a good group of actors.",The Dead Don't Die
854,lukesc-88805,One of the most misunderstood movies ever,10,17 August 2021,"Just popped on here to make a brief statement about easily one of my favourite movies of the past ten years. This here isn't so much a review but something small to consider before both seeing this movie and criticising it.To make things brief, before being a zombie movie, it is a Jim Jarmusch movie. If you go into this movie expecting a derivative, straight up zombie comedy horror flick, you will hate it. I went into this movie with an open mind knowing it wouldn't be such. If you can expect anything from Jim Jarmusch it's that he won't ever deliver a project that stays in the confines of its genre. Whether that's horror or comedy, he just won't. If you watch The Dead Don't Die as more of an experiment than a film, I guarantee you will enjoy it a lot more than without doing so.",The Dead Don't Die
855,jake87-3,I loved it!,10,23 June 2019,"Admittedly, I'm a huge Jim Jarmusch fan. But I was never bored. I loved all the references that only us Jarmusch fans would get. I would recommend it anyway. No, it wasn't a masterpiece, but I seriously doubt it was meant to be. It was better, however, than most of the mainstream crap being shoved in our faces. (Gee, how many times have I said that about Jarmusch films?) Maybe that's why I keep going back to him.",The Dead Don't Die

857,jimhurcomb,What a Zombie treat!,9,16 September 2020,"Saw the DVD in the $5 at Walmart, and being a fan of Zombies, not necessarily the Director, I picked it up. The trailer was intriguing, vut then I read the reviews and was turned off. Plus it's a bad sign when there are no gushy critical endorsements on the CD box. But it was a slow Tuesday night, so why not? I loved it, right off the get-go. What sealed the deal was that amazing reference to the theme music, and then later, the script. The cast is comedy gold, and the Zombie action is pretty good. I loved the inside references sprinkled throughout, especially the shout out to the Canadian country duo The Good Brothers. Iggy Pop was, well, just Iggy, but that's always good enough. Cool movie, but I can see why it wasn't a big hit like ""Zombieland"". If you like to go deeper with your film-viewing fare give it a try. I will watch this more than once to see what I missed the first time around.",The Dead Don't Die
858,danieljjclifford,Trying to be a Cohen film?,3,20 June 2021,"I, like many other reviewers, was excited for the cast and general plot. I felt this could be an instant cult classic that melded two things together, horror and dry wit. I was disappointed. The writing is super bland with no real direction or purpose. As much as I enjoy meandering dialogue if it's couched intelligently in a directional film, this was the opposite. A meandering plot with sub-meandering conversations.To add to that, they brought far too many characters into the fray leaving me somewhat bored when they were given their moments. I half expected a sort of meeting of minds halfway through whereby they would all interact and give a grounded feeling to the ""small town day to day affairs,"" but for all intents and purposes, they remained mostly islands of dialogue separated by a lot of filler.

Maybe it was the kind moves of a production company to fulfill the big screen desires of a writer with down syndrome? Tommy Wiseau? No, certainly any of those answers would have brought this film a deserving cult following, instead, this flaming dumpster fire... A flaming dumpster fire would have had more going for it in mood, energy, excitement, and anticipation than this steaming pile of excrement. It's shocking this film received rewards for anything. SFX make-up? Really? The only way you can like this film is if you have the ammount of brain activity as the portrayed undead. My expectations were for some decent fun like Slither, but what I got was something some how worse than House of the Dead directed by Uwe Boll and with such a bloated all-star cast that's saying a lot.

It was a truly terrible script and a poorly written movie. I really wasn't impressed whatsoever! I feel bad for the talented people who starred in it, because whoever wrote this was bloody lucky to get such talent. Just a very bad film!

However, some parts were so slow, like the opening. I know many will turn it off well before any action begins. If they didn't tell you something weird was going on you'd have no clue.

I personally was amused from start to finish and had even a few laughing fits. It is a horror comedy movie, but the humor is very dry and sarcastic, more similar to French or British comedies than American ones. Of course, this is a generalization and there are exceptions, e.g., if you like the Cohens' movies or get the humor in David Lynch's movies, you might also like this one.It is true that all the characters are out of place, the tempo is slow (as in every other Jarmusch movie), and everything is off-beat, but that is precisely the point of this movie. And it is not as easily achieved as some reviewers seem to think. Anyway, it's not supposed to be a ""realistic zombie move"". It is a witty exploitation meta-movie that plays with movie clichés, deconstructs them freely and, in my opinion, is much better than the pretentious ""Only Lovers Left Alive"". And this is supposed to be fun.

916,Tom-Ashem,It gave me bad dreams...,3,5 September 2019,"No, not because how scary it was. I actually woke up from a feverish dream because of how bad that script was. ""Who was talking about Zelda Fitzgerald? Why? Oh, it's just JJ"". By the way, sorry for using your nickname JJ, but I wouldn't know it was your nickname if you hadn't written yourself into the movie.The cast was obviously magnificent, but it seemed like even they tried to act down, so I just don't know what the hell this thing was. It wasn't Sharknado, I gave Sharknado 9 out of 10. If a movie knows it's bad and it's still good at the same time, I can tell the difference. This movie winked at itself a few times all throughout as if it was some sort of Zombieland meets Deadpool meets Sharknado. It was NEITHER of those, nor was it anything close. The script had multiple plots that went completely nowhere. It's as if Bill Murray walked up to JJ and said, ""Hey, I hated being killed off in Zombieland"", can you write me a movie where I outlive bunch of other famous people?"" and JJ replied. ""Sure, I was just planning to go to the bathroom anyway, I'll be back in an hour with your script.""As a matter of fact I started this review by giving it 4 stars... about mid-review I lowered it to 3, but I honestly can't think of any worse movie than this. Was production even good? Perhaps set design was good? How was the sound design? Was there even original score, or did they just keep playing the same country song over and over? I don't remember.

Its purpose only reveals itself after true reflection on what it portrayed.The fact that so many viewers completely missed its allegory to our complete desensitization to the environmental destruction and rampant capitalism of our time only proves its point. We don't get it. We see the end coming (we've 'seen the script') and stay remarkably composed and distracted while the world falls apart.There are no histrionics, no heroics, no laughs, no discrimination and no escape - unless you shun the way of life that is on the way out or are rejected by this dysfunctional world.At first I thought I had been trolled by Jarmusch. But then it became clear.
This film rebels against modern movies that hold your hand through a story while all the points are spelled out and all the messages are made clear. This one subverts your expectations while all the time plastering its message all over the screen.It's not a movie. It's a warning. A very serious one.",The Dead Don't Die

Anytime a director breaks the fourth wall to insert himself into the movie = pretentious.Admittedly, I hadn't seen many (or any) of this director's movies before, and I'd never heard of him, either.I can try to find something I enjoy that is done well in almost any movie.This movie...it was tough.So what did I find redeeming about the movie? The cinematography was beautiful. I actually kinda chuckled once or twice.But I still found myself seriously regretting having purchased a digital copy of it. I actually consciously thought ""Would I rather be asleep right now?"" while watching the movie.And the cast, wow, what a waste! Fantastic cast here, but the script is just garbage.And the UFO? WTH was that?Rather than watching this movie, I highly suggest you just watch the trailer (which touches all the high points anyway) and then sit, close your eyes and contemplate what the movie could have been.Trust me, your imagination is better than what this movie is!Or, instead of doing that, one could twiddle their thumbs for 100 minutes...or watch paint dry.

928,Marlene_,A unique take on a dull genre,5,19 July 2019,"Paternon was the only movie I saw from Jarmusch before watching The Dead Don't Die and enjoyed it quite a bit. I was surprised when I found out Jarmusch was making a zombie movie, but was excited even though I don't think much of zombie movies.The plot revolves around a small fictional town called Centerville trying to battle the hord of the undead caused by the polar shifting of the earth... Sounds like the most meta zombie schlock ever unteal you realise what direction is the movie actually taking. Throughout the movie little bits and pieces of information were given like the moment when the two main characters Ronnie and Cliff are talking about the song on the radio and Ronnie saying that ""It's the theme song"". At that point the audience can only suspect what that means, but it becomes obvious that the whole movie is just a jab at 50s and 60s b movies with a sprinkling of social commrntary. Amateurish dialogue, slow pacing, emotionless acting and ultimately the braking of the fourth wall all add up to an almost perfect satire. The main complaint that I have with this movie is its end when the hermit Bob has a monologue explaining the already pretty obvious themes of consumerism layed throughout the movie.The critics weren't very generous when reviewing this movie, but I'm certain that it will gain a cult following over time. I highly recommend it.",The Dead Don't Die
929,tmartino-39195,EXTREMELY disappointed,3,12 September 2019,Big Adam Driver guy (why? i dont know i think he's funny looking and his voice is nice) and had high hopes for this film along with the cast. Trailer set the tone for a funny dumb spoof zombie movie. I'm no rotten tomatoes movie critic but gah dam was this movie a let down. The build up was nice but what did it build up to? Nothing at all. Again very very disappointed in this film but it was so boring and as I watched I kept wondering what the hell was going on. I did laugh at some parts and laughed harder than I should have honestly but that's ok I enjoy some really dumb things. Rented it off Xfinity for $6 and I can't wait till it's free in 3 weeks regret my purchase and watch it again. Yikes I don't even know how this movie was in theaters. So random,The Dead Don't Die

The humor is intended for a very niche audience. I gave it a few chuckles, but more because I wanted to relate to the director and the writer then because it was actually funny. I also think its very referential with its allusions towards common themes of the zombie genre combined with a bit of obvious Tarantino spice. The breaking of the fourth wall doesn't have a clear justification. What I liked was the critique of capitalism in zombie portrayal and how it alludes that we the viewers are the zombies.

Never in my life have I seen such a wasted amount of potential. You sit there waiting for anything of interest to happen but it never does.
The vast majority of the movie is of the cop car visiting the same places over and over in a slow drawn out process.There is no emotion displayed at any point by any character whatsoever. Most characters are completely irrelevant.In the 1hr40 there were maybe 2/3 jokes (very dry humour), both of which could have been hit or miss depending on your sense of humour.Towards the end of the movie they completely just gave up, making 'jokes' about the director giving them the script so they know what is going to happen.What happened to Zelda's character really cemented the fact that the entire movie had no point and they just gave up.
It feels like the entire point of making this movie is to try get people to buy the only song they played 4-5 times throughout the film.0/10 - never in my life have I given such a poor review.I hope the director never makes another film again.",The Dead Don't Die

961,Sofiakielba,There are cleverly boring and boringly clever.,5,4 October 2021,"This movie is both. I understand what Jim Jarmusch are trying to say and it's very poetic. It could have been amazing and the casting was spot on but he doesn't get it to work for me. He is trying too hard to make a point. There is a global zombie outbreak because of the polars melting. The story fails not because it's slow and sometimes even boring but, because the indifference of the main characters, which I absolutely believe was also a point but it got too much. Too preachy.He completely ignores the need of meaningful human interaction and relationships which is why this fails so badly. There are some small snippets of relationships and familiarity between the characters and those are beautiful and makes you care but we're mostly starved of it, as the emotional and attached people are the first ones to die.The entire point of the movie is that we are all zombies, too attached to things but it forgets that most of us wouldn't survive living in the woods alone and a lot of things are critical for our own survival and there is no way for us to not have these things. Then of CourseOf course the point might be to let humanity die but he doesn't kill all of the citizens of Centerville, as far as we know the juvie kids got to a safe hiding place and of course, Hermit Bob lives on. So there are still hope even though we can't be sure that the zombies won't go for Bob and the kids later.I'm not sure what he want us to take with us from it. It's a commentary on today but it's not a memorial one. It's not nuanced or even especially interesting to discuss. Unfortunately I won't be able to recommend this film, it's too boring and there are many questions with no answer. Not like think for yourself, more we didn't bother to answer them.The funniest parts of the movie are the Easter eggs from other movies the cast have worked on.It's a shame he doesn't get it to work as the cast is phenomenal and it's not a bad idea.",The Dead Don't Die

971,HennyJimdrix,A Very Jarmusch-esque Zombie Parody,6,20 June 2021,"Fans of Jarmusch's curt absurdism and quirky characterizations will find a bit of what they like. It is well-acted, well-shot, and the makeup & effects are excellent. But the film really only works as a send-up of other zombie movies, and only veterans of the genre will be equipped to appreciate the intentional irony of the narrative.All the traditional zombie movie characters are inserted - the aging cop & his young partner; the nervous woman; the precocious children; the gun-nut loner; the awkward nerd; the sweet old man; the cool young hipsters (including the obvious Final Girl). All are well-presented, played by famous faces, and would seem like prime candidates for End-Credits Survivors, yet every one is unceremoniously killed off - some almost immediately after their introduction. There's also the Unkillable Badass Saviour - another staple of zombie films - who is removed from the equation here in the most Jarmusch way imaginable, without ever saving anyone. Nobody gets a happy ending or a dramatic escape. Then it's all tied together with a half-hearted diatribe on society's ills, and how ""the living are the real zombies"" - another common trope of zombie fiction, done in a semi-ironic fashion.As a subversion of a much-maligned and oversaturated genre, it makes its points fairly well. But as the zombie genre is much-maligned already, it feels like those points weren't really worth making - particularly with such a lack of wider appeal. Viewers who are unfamiliar with the genre - perhaps attracted to this film purely by its stellar cast - will feel like it didn't have any point at all.",The Dead Don't Die

-You are someone who expects this to be the film version of the Walking Dead, or even an homage to the zombie genre.
-You are someone who needs their films packed with overstimulating special effects, violence, and shallow humor.
-Your only Bill Murray frame of reference is Caddyshack or Ghostbusters (in which case, I urge you to see Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers, and Rushmore.)
-You are someone who needs 100 story lines happening per scene to stay entertained
-You don't know who Jim Jarmusch is.Though my review is probably more of a response to other, lower rated reviews, this was still the best movie I have seen i a long time. I dare say it is Jarmusch's best, or up there with Night on Earth which still seems underdeveloped in comparison.Jarmusch's work has always catered to a specific demographic, and though this movie contains old and new favorites alike, his aesthetic shines through better than ever in The Dead Don't Die. The deadpan, understated, abstract humor, the pacing (some think it is slow but I found it perfect), the writing and very most of all - it's refusal to take itself too seriously (a flaw which Coffee and Cigarettes fell victim to, save for a few shining scenes.) I found myself (and mostly everyone in the theater) laughing genuinely and heartily. This film, like most Jarmusch films, is a playful comedy at heart. All the old Jarmusch gang is wonderful as usual, the standouts being Tilda Swinton (perhaps a bit Tarantino-esque in her character as Zelda), and Tom Waits as Hermit Bob, who at age 70 is better than ever.I left this film feeling SEEN and warm-hearted, even though ""things ended badly"", as oft predicted by Officer Ronnie Peterson. Jarmusch's sense of whimsy, humor, and charm is refreshing, and man - does he ever know how to take an ironic jab at hipsters.",The Dead Don't Die

When I first found out that this movie had so many great actors I got SUPER excited. I thought by the trailers that it would be really good but I was honestly disappointed. It wasn't the worst zombie movie but it's definitely not a favorite. They really could've done better, a lot better. I think my biggest thing was no one was really trying to fight the zombies until the pathetic attempt at the end. I mean come on they're slow zombies like in Night of the Living Dead not fast like in Dawn of the Dead!!! Why couldn't they kill more zombies and where were the rest of the townspeople? There was no surviving, no running, not even a fast paced walk!!! Also, that stupid song that was even getting on Bill Murray's nerves, was horrible!!! I started to fall asleep halfway through, which is very rare, especially during zombie movies. The humor was very dry and it left you hanging in some places. I am going to watch it one more time to see if maybe I missed some funny parts. Hopefully, I did. So I gave points for the actors, the camera didn't move around absolutely crazy, it gave us a reason for the zombie outbreak and it wasn't made with a cell phone. I couldn't give it any higher because instead of trying to fight for life they just moped around, I felt like it was just thrown together there was not really a middle to the storyline, we knew more about the 18 townspeople as to the entire reason for the zombies to rise, and it was a very weird ending especially Tilda Swinton, and instead of feeling excited I just felt meh. Also, what was the point of the two zombies craving coffee instead of human flesh? Yeah I get that they did things that they loved doing but come on. I truly was excited about this movie and I really hate to say such negative things but I was so disappointed in the movie which sucks but hopefully zombieland 2 will be out soon and hopefully it won't be like this one.",The Dead Don't Die

The writer made sure we knew all of his political views without having to think at all, and they're pretty poor views to have. Most importantly though, it was just so boring. Nothing happens the entire movie, I kept waiting for it to pick up, but the whole time people just made bad decisions for no reason then die uninterestingly by zombies. That's the movie.

The other genres I agree with, albeit not stereotypically so, but nothing in this movie is even near comedy.I was surprised to find out the writer/director of this movie also made 'Only lovers left alive', a movie I aboslutely adore, and really enjoy the slowness off. Nothing in this movie is interesting, nothing in this movie is funny (and not even ""oh come on"" type of bad unfunny, its just unfunny in the same way working overtime in an empty office while staring at the same paper for 30 minutes is unfunny).This movie left me with that exact feeling, not even a smile at any point, not feeling mad about how bad it was, no surprise, literally just apathy. You feel every second of this movie in the worst way possible and the movie gives you nothing to keep you there.I love surrealism, and art that has no point/doesn't make sense. (For example, the movie 'Vivarium', a pointless movie that leaves you feeling unsatisfied but plays around with the content of the movie to keep you engaged while watching, or the movies by Yorgos Lanthimos, that are slow and monotone but also plays around with absurdity). This movie going ""lol random, nothing matters"" and ""this isnt what people would say in real life, what a hoot"" is not that. This movie is unflavoured gum. It supposedly contains something, but it certainly feels like nothing.",The Dead Don't Die
1018,Brad_G,Adam Driver - the new King of deadpan comedy!!!,10,16 May 2019,"Okay, going into Dead don't die (which is already out in Paris) after reading the mixed reviews from critics, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. But, hey, give me a Murray movie any day and I'll gladly watch it. I was quite pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this quiet, laid back movie - too laid back even for a zombie themed horror-comedy. Yet, totally in sync with Jarmusch's signature style casualness, this movie actually entertains you through and through. Zombies running amok in a small town, signalling impending zombie apocalypse - ""yeah, heard that"" you might say - but here's the deal, the casual style with which Jarmusch approaches this, with a movie that ""doesn't take itself seriously"" yet with an underlying ""irony within it all"" is what made this casual romp surprisingly entertaining for me. The ending may feel a bit pointless, yet I believe that's exactly the affect Jarmusch was going for with this movie. I went in as a Murray fan, came away as Driver fan! Among several, if there is one reason you should see this movie, is do it, just to experience and realise about Adam Driver's wide range of comedy chops. I mean I already knew this guy is the most versatile and talented actor on the planet today, having watched and enjoyed his outstanding performances in Logan Lucky, Starwars and the latest BlackkKlansman. Yet this movie cemented for me why Driver should also do more comedy movies. Most of us will remember his unforgettably hilarious SNL skit ''career day' as the oil baron Parnassus (which I believe deserves an Emmy of its own). Well, contrast that with the spot-on deadpan, laid back tone of his comedic display in this movie as the nerdy cop Ronnie Peterson and you will realise this guy has got leviathan range even in his comedy skills spanning beyond into another galaxy. His brilliant comedic delivery helps keep this movie ticking. Teaming Driver with Murray (known as the king of deadpan comedy) was a stroke of genius casting by Jarmusch. And with the ever-entertaining Tilda in the mix (Tilda is Tilda!) you have a fun matinee romp with this movie. To sum up my experience, I loved and enjoyed this movie immensely. I left the movie thinking about the Driver/Murray duo, as to who emerged the winner of the trophy for delivering the best deadpan comedy? For me Driver won out. I love Murray (as a longtime fan) but the way Driver injects nerdy absurdity in his brilliant laconic delivery nailed his performance, which for me is the highlight of this movie. This was followed by Tilda's charged delivery as a samurai wielding mortician. I can certainly say that Driver inherits the title as the new king of deadpan comedy. This movie is worth it, even just to watch the hulking form of Driver cramming into a convertible smart car, plus the way he says ""ghouls"" among a repertoire of other words and phrases, which sound cool and iconic just for the way he delivers them. ""Ghouls"" is the new ""Cauliflower""! I loved this silly laid-back fun movie, which despite leaving you wondering what's the point of it all, so zombie apocalypse is here, the movie simply shrugs and says yeah. Yet, the relaxed tone belies a meta deep enough to subliminally stimulate you to ponder upon the underlying commentary on the state of our current society as unravelled through the nuggets laid out throughout the movie with an unmistakable comedic poignancy. I definitely recommend this movie as a ""must see"". A full ten stars from me!",The Dead Don't Die

I thought that if nothing else, I would see what all of the fuss was about. I paused this movie at the point where I first laughed and found myself at the one hour mark. I then blew a little more air than usual out of my nose a two or three more times by the end due to a little surprise and one legitimately clever joke.My disappointment comes mostly from seeing the potential of this film so horrendously wasted. The pairing of Adam Driver and Bill Murray as a dry comedic duo was genius. Making them small-town cops in the midst of a zombie-apocalypse was even better. However, most of the run time is occupied by the two just noticing that things are a little strange.The movie is so weighed down by ""strange happenings"" tropes that I cannot tell whether they are being mocked or abused in all seriousness. Either way, I have seen far cleverer parody and uses of the tropes within the past five years that have actually worked.The movie just feels like a college student project all around and not in a good way by any means.

Right at the start, you'll notice so many famous actors/celebrities (Bill Murray, Adam Driver and Selena Gomez for some reason?) and that got me thinking; ""How did the producers get these people to appear in this movie?In the opening credits of the movie; Selena Gomez's name appears and her character appears near the beginning of the movie with some additional friends, this made me think that she was going to be one of the struggling survivors, nope, she is in the movie for about 10 minutes-tops and dies offscreen.There's also this group of children who would appear every so often and encounter the aftermath of the officers and other protagonists, this makes you think that eventually they'll come across the officers, but no, the children just randomly run off to a nearby building and that's all the screentime we're given for them.Now, my main problem with this movie: This movie is listed as a comedy, but this movie throws so much stuff at you, it keeps informing the viewer of the effects happening to earth and how that's causing disaster. I would normally be fine with this, but they spend so much of the movie telling us this and it gets to the point making this movie really slow. But that's not the worst part, after they finished with this information, nothing happens, the protagonists just drive along in their car looking at stuff and this just drags out the ending so much.This movie is a weird one for me, because I really did not like this movie, but one of my friends had a blast watching it, so I guess you can watch it for yourslef and see what you think.But at the end of the day, just watch Shawn of the Dead, that movie is also comedy, but more funny than this movie.",The Dead Don't Die
1030,andreyhotpot,One of the best dark comedies of the year,9,9 November 2019,"I decided to write a review after seeing so many negative comments. Guys, have you completely lost sense of humor? After seeing so many dull movies this year Dead don't die is surprisingly entertaining from the very beginning to the end. Well, it is not a perfect movie but still worth watching for people who wants a good comedy. The actors are playing very well and the zombies were more than real. It is a dark comedy. So the action has to be taken with a pintch of salt. People who liked The Art of Self-Defence will like Dead Don't Die as well.",The Dead Don't Die
1031,nathansbacchus,Meh.,5,12 November 2019,Great cast. Few laughs. Looked so good. Was actually quite boring and nothing really happened. Think the film was trying to show how we're zombies already and a zombie apocalypse wouldn't change much.,The Dead Don't Die

Its started off OK but descended into an utter mess. If you have nothing else to watch, watch it for the sake of seeing that rubbish like this gets released.

Highly derivative of ""Sean of the Dead"" and maybe Fargo but with very weak story telling.",The Dead Don't Die

It's slow pace and lack of self respect are abundantly clear throughout the movie.However, I really believe that this rating(5,5) and some of the reviews are too harsh. The movie is hardly about the undead, the first half is just a not so casual day in a really small town, and an unexpected plus was the ""crazy"" guy's narration. The plot of the movie itself is mediocre but the cast definitely saves the day and makes the movie pretty enjoyable.Some of the best bits were the extraordinary 4th wall scenes of adam driver and the pessimistic note that the movie ends with.This movie does not take itself seriously and I don't even care.

1046,joel-taylor22,Missed the mark,2,22 July 2021,"Great list of actors but the film fell well short. Incredibly slow and boring story (I was constantly skipping forwards).

Its a satire movie so if you dont understand that humor, you are probably going to think this movie stinks.Its humor makes fun of its own self and there is a twist you never expect that made me laugh out loud.

Sorry people, it seems your taste died or you watch movies that are not for you. I mean I would never review Shaun of the dead, because the fact that i did not liked it has something to do with the fact that I don't like this kind of cinematography, not the movie itself.

If I had seen this film in the cinema, I would have afterwards not only demanded the entrance fee, but still compensation for the lost time. No real Stoy, actors who are bored in cars, a few effects that wear off after the second appearance, not even a real movie. Just that someone had tried to make a film without any real concept, but with budget. The idea was that it was going to be a zombie movie with a few well-known actors in it. Good: Zombies are plentiful, the well-known actors are present. However, they do not do acting, but they talk and move. - Bad: An endless list of unnecessary scenes, no real story, no context, no ideas, no highlights, not a single spell that you should remember, nothing at all. You ask yourself from the first half of the movie, why am I even looking there, since then your own head is not there at all ... - Can it be that one should feel like a zombie when watching? That would be the only explainable reason for the existence of this film for me. - Everyone, but really every other movie in this genre is better than this. Even the smartphone Halloween video of the 6-year-old neighbor's daughter as a mummy has more content and style.",The Dead Don't Die

Cannot understand why the actors accepted to be part of this movie. This movie is the slowest I have ever seen. Most people in the movie had no will to survive/help, made stupid decisions. Bad story telling at all. Many actors appear only for some seconds some minutes later they are death.

1069,mackenzienellis,Die before watching this movie.,1,16 January 2020,"This movie earned one star. By that, I mean the makers of this movie had to work HARD to make it this bad. A good first step was persuading such a talented and celebrated cast to embarrass themselves. This is a film that is more horse dung than what an inattentive and lazy amateur could have made.Whether you're an avid fan of George Romero, just like zombie horror, or are a feckless fanboy who just loves George Romero references because it makes you sound countercultured and antitrendy, don't watch this movie. Don't waste 1h38m of your precious life.Nothing in this movie matters, which could have been an ironic statement in itself, were the filmmakers intending to make it, but being beaten in the face with the metaphor that we have caused our own doom by abusing our natural world is unavoidable, proving that we're supposed to take the content of the film seriously. We're supposed to think about our errors and our vices and repent.I don't care about anyone in this film. I don't want to save them, and I don't want them to survive. I wonder how many polar ice caps were fracked in the making of this horror.Two things are worth stealing from this movie and reusing elsewhere, though: RZA, saying ""This world is perfect--appreciate the details"" and Buscemi's hat, which affronts English grammar and logic and the moral nostril by proclaiming, ""Keep America White Again.""

Let's just say that this genre is not one Jarmusch could handle at all and he shouldn't to begin with. All the characters are poorly written, most of them have no reason of existing in the first place like the Teenagers from Cleveland, the kids fromthe juvenile hall or the mortician character amongst many others.

Everything seemed inconsistent and annoyingly pretentious - when you repeat a joke for the 5th time it 1. either stops being a joke or 2.it plays an actual part at the scenario and the story-telling or 3. you want on purpose to make a wacko film. Jarmusch stays between 1 and 3 for the whole film, constantly repeating jokes (at first it seemed really fun but then it became so tiresome). He also builds characters for no reason at all just to never use them again with an actual meaning. And though he knows the recipe he never gets to cook aka half the film has interesting things from which any director could film a funny and cool zombie movie, but no he prefers to mess it all up. Good cast, funny starting scenario, and yet he fails to bind them all together in any meaningful purpose (and I don't mean the plot, by need) .

I enjoy slow,dry humor, but this is an awful attempt. I laughed 3 times in 103 mins hence my 3 star rating. Everything is sooo slow. The cars. The dialogue. It appears they not have a way to record anything moving faster than 3mph. Also breaking the 4th wall twice? So, so cringeworthy.The plot is so nonsensical. So fracking caused the earth to tilt causing long periods of night day causing the dead to come alive. Oh and pets freakout because the earth tilted or something? We also try to tie in a storyline about 3 kids in a detention center for no reason aside from exposition. Oh and surprise we were invaded by aliens.So Jim, the writer/director, tries to loosely tie in social commentary because of fracking and a throwaway line right before credits roll about materialistic people already being zombies. It's really bad writing.

Yes, that's not another modern-type-comedy of total BTB jokes.

The casting is awesome (Iggyyy...!), direction, script, soundtrack...it's all there. People who did not enjoy this film had obviously different expectations. This is not a Hollywood action packed film intended for ""zombie audiences"". This is as close as one can get to an original zombie flick in 2019.

This zombie movie is no B- yet it stings your brain, and freshens the screen as it should.
Jim Jarmush unites his faithful besties, along with delightful newbies, to bring you up into a satirical though poetic middle of nowhere, touched by unavoidable bad ending. It's an ode to History, that of human's desperate need to conquer and consume, that of America, that of cinema and arts which lighten the burden of our lost civilisation.
« The world is perfect... Pay attention to the details » whispers the delivery guy, sharpening your conscience towards the more or less subtle references planted inside the whole script (just ask Adam Driver for more information, or attend another screening). From Hitchcock to Tarentino, David Lynch to George Lucas, Herman Melville to Stephen King, and so much more, you just can't stop feeling satisfied. Dialogues are hilarious and characters keep close to absurd yet never fall off the cliff (send all my love to Bill).

Because I enjoyed the movie less and less as it progressed.It starts as a joyful, unconventional exploration of personalities and possibilities but slowly reduced itself. But then this is one of those movies,it highlights death and struggle and uncertainty.

1174,allshamnowow-95214,A Very Boring And A Slow Movie,3,14 July 2019,"In a little American town, three policemen (Bill Murray,Adam Driver,Chloe Sevigny) must face an incoming zombie invasion. It may seem like a horror comedy but it really isn't that. It can be judged like that since I only laughed a single time and slightly grinned two times.Sadly, I think that has to do a lot with Jim Jarmusch who wrote and directed this film and I have a different relationship with him than most of you. So Im going to say it right now so that we are clear:Most of Jim's films seem like a boring exhibition to me and with the last few years, I think it has only gotten worse. It got so bad that I stopped going to the cinema to watch his movies. Now I've decided to change that, since what I thought from the trailers, he directed a fun horror/comedy movies.
But I was so wrong.The Dead Don't Die is a very cheap film in every way possible. In the early days of movies, many filmmakers were disliked since zombies were basically cheap masks from latex. Nowadays we see chopping off heads using digital tricks, where zombies don't have blood in their veins, but dust.Don't do in thinking that there will be some fun zombie action, since the first zombie is seen 30 mins. into the movies and the first one is killed an hour into the movie.The Dead Don't Die isn't a 'Horror-Action-Comedy, not even a 'Horror-Comedy'. Maybe a 'comedy',but I look at it as a 'meta-comedy', that tries to be funny by using typical cliché scenes from other movies. But by using those scenes, they never add anything new to the movies, it does not even generate the wit that it's supposed to have.Most of all, im inclined to the theory that Jarmusch was disgusted with the current state of the world and cinema and made a film that is as embarrasing as most commercial cinematography.(at least in Jarmusch's eyes). I think thats the only positive option that comes to my mind. The other one is ''Jarmusch is senile''.A huge variety of cast members are moving through scenes that have almost zero to negative speed. It's almost fascinating how you can shoot such a boring scene where ''you chop off heads of zombies while driving a car'' or ''UFO comes crashing down and takes someone to space''(yes this movie has UFO's). Id love to see how this movie was shot, since I don't believe that this movie had any script written beforehand.
Here are some scenes for example:A redneck Steve Buscemi should be funny, because he has a dog called Rumsfeld,owns a cap with the tag ''Make America White Again"", and he says accidentally before a black man ""This coffee is too black"". That's it, nothing elseZombies in the 21st Century don't repeat the word ""Brains"", but other things they bargain for like ""Wi-Fi"", ""Bluetooth"", ""Siri"". But in the movie we dont see them consuming any of these aforementioned things.
In the film, we see the television sets that broadcast something several times, while in the broadcasting there are shots of zombies flashing for fractions of seconds. How and Why does this work? Did the zombies hack into the radio transmitters? We never knowMost of the events are watched from a nearby forest by a dirty hermit (Tom Waits) and he describes aloud what the viewer sees. He'll never do anything else for the whole movie.Some scenes are additionally accelerated to make the zombies act more acutely, but it has the side effect that normally moving actors (which I probably shouldn't notice because they are in the background) look like in old grotesqueMany times Jarmusch is trying to wake up humor by repeating a funny line (which wasn't very funny for the first time and becomes unbearable after the third repetition)The most interesting moments for me were the moments of meta-humor, when the characters on the screen talk about being actors in the movie, ""this is the main song,"" and that Jim gave some of them scripts for the movie .That gave me a hint of interest (and I laughed at it) and I would appreciate it if the whole movie was based on it. But unfortunately it is only one - two minutes in the whole picture and otherwise Jarmusch does not pay attention to it.So thanks and goodbye Jim, we probably won't meet each other in a cinema ever again",The Dead Don't Die

1196,samanmoran,Self aggrandizement in zombie garb.,1,19 October 2019,"I saw this last night at a local library which screened it because it was shot in the region where we live. It was a small audience and I couldn't leave without seeming rude. Sitting through this made me feel like I was trapped at my brother-in-law's and forced to watch my nephew's film school final, only without the benefit of a couch and plenty of red wine.Jim Jarmusch appears to believe that giving his audience an opportunity to oggle his clique of quasi-indie Hollywood buddies is reason enough to put this out there as a legitimate entertainment. Allow me to inform Mr. Jarmusch it is not.Nope, simply seeing Iggy Pop dressed up like a zombie is not enough reason to sit through 90 minutes of throwaway performances by otherwise talented people (Tom Waits aside- his performance got the sole star in my rating). Had Iggy given us a break-out number of Lust for Life, well then perhaps hilarity would have ensued, but who's to say? Had these folks gotten together and made a little zombie flick on a lark and then screened it in a side room at some Beverly Hills cocktail parties, I'm sure the insiders would have enjoyed a chuckle. Similarly to my hypothetical nephew's screening party. With enough booze and plenty of comfy seating, and no need to be quiet, it could liven up an otherwise boring party.I won't bother reviewing the actual (sic) film. Just take my word for it, it's bad. But what really irks me, is the attitude behind the notion that it's somehow worth putting out there to the general public.

1199,alyaburyasha,Aimes to be Shaun of the Dead but fails,1,10 December 2019,"50 shades of mockery.This movie is mocking the zombie flicks, how dumb and badly acted they are, how their plot is simplistic and predictable, but it's not doing it in an interesting or a funny way.
Then again, fans of the film will say it's meant to be that way, because the movie is mocking your expectations of it being filled with action, comedy and all that jazz. I can believe it being true, but tell me, movie, why is it so ridiculous for me to be expecting some form of entertainment from you?
Then the film is mocking people overall, I guess, with their consumerism, addictions and living in a haze like zombies. Again, this message is neither fresh, nor subtly put. In fact, it's hammered into your head throughout the movie, spelled out again and again. I guess, the movie is also half mocking this message too. I am getting lost in shades of irony here.
Moving on, the movie breaks the fourth wall, again non-subtly, uninterestingly and unfunny. Which is mocking, I don't know, art overall? The plot goes weirdly absurd too but not in a good way.Look. Shaun of the Dead did a great job at everything this movie was trying to achieve with the zombie genre. This is not it. Monty Python did what this film tried to do with the fourth wall and absurd comedy. This is not it.
At the end, I just imagine Jim Jarmusch giving the middle finger to the genre, to cinema, to art, to the audience who didn't like it and even to those who think they are smarter than the audience who didn't like it - to everyone and everything. I don't know why there is so much contempt in this work, and why it has been delivered so painfully, but I strongly recommend you watch Shaun of The Dead or Monty Python's Flying Circus instead.",The Dead Don't Die

And here we see a very large nod to the absurdist and farcical styles, similar to Tom Stoppard's skills. And, of course, this matches superbly with the over-enthusiastic ""deadpan"" performances.So, what is this film? Within the context of everything described above, placed firmly within an apocalyptic world-wide zombie and planetary destruction as ""we"" know it, it becomes a semi-hazily, but definite nonetheless, social commentary upon the modern world, and what people focus on within it, from the sole perspective of one character. And that character is not Bill Murray's.It's definitely not a sit back, relax and enjoy heartedly type of film. It's comical satire, but strongly inclusive of an absurdist/farcical drama playing out.
It is a film to watch if you enjoy questioning society and film itself, and enjoy postulating within subtexts, genres and stylistic endeavours, as to the true validity and meaning the film holds within its core and essence.",The Dead Don't Die

1208,verticalsnap,Contender for worst movie ever,1,16 September 2021,"Seriously, I have watched so many movies, I can't believe the amount sometimes. Many have been bad, that isn't a problem. Sometimes they are so bad they're good. I try not watch a film with expectation and can always find and appreciate aspects, even if it might not be my taste.In saying that, this is honestly without exaggeration or hesitation has to be in my top 3 worst movies of all time. The cast was great, even a cameo by Selina Gomez was a surprise. However I don't think there could have been a more pointless and completely asinine story, with irrelevant characters and terrible awful tangents of events. Can not call it plot twists because there is zero plot. None of the actors of note should have wasted there time and nor should you. It was giving an impression that it was going to be slightly zombie land-ish. Though it just absolutely sucked in every way.",The Dead Don't Die
1209,roland-98287,"Skip it and spend the evening reading the expiration dates of the canned goods in your zombie apocalypse pantry, it's a more entertaining prospect.",1,18 March 2020,"The thematic phrase repeated by Adam Driver's character--""This isn't going to end well,"" is actually an ironic warning to the audience: it doesn't begin well either--and the middle is also pretty uninspired. The most thoughtful premise in this film are those which spring from the idea that ""people do the same things in death they did in life,"" which is as good an invitation to the muses of comedy and satire to descend as anything ever invented, however to demonstrate this point, the most incisive commentary Jarmusch can offer is the image of zombies equipped with smartphones. Really? Welcome to 2002, Jim. It's much worse than we thought. Pushing against the fourth wall, the self commentary between the characterss who are constantly questioning the nature of the film they're in, and whether or not their reality is scripted, lands with more self-consciousness than self-awareness. This, because it's a dead-eyed-slam-dunk that these actors could improvise a better movie than this poor attempt at scriptwriting. Likely, one of them would have at least mined the comedy in the fact that you can't actually open a squad car's backseat door from the inside-- a testament to the least amount of effort that went into the writing. So, no attention to detail, no real story or character development, and nothing interesting to say...why are you making this move, exactly? For the awkward self comparison to Plan 9 From Outer Space and Night of the Living Dead? Both of which are better flicks than this.
Whether this film is a testament to pride, privilege, lack of inspiration, ineptitude, or possibly all four qualities is secondary to the question of whether ""Down By Law"" was a fluke. ""Director staggers through film with half-dead ideas, apparently drunk senseless on his fame and exploits the talents of his actors"" seems like a better premise for a zombie film.",The Dead Don't Die

The trailer led me to falsely believe that the movie was a) Funny b) exciting c) a horror movie. d) high quality because of the excellent cast. It was none of these things. I can't believe that all of these well known and respected actors read the script and still agreed to be associated with this turkey, I can only assume that Jim Jarmusch had obtained compromising pictures of them all doing something explicit and perverse with farmyard animals and threatened to release the pics if they didn't agree to appear.

There are characters that seem to be interesting (the kids in the facility) but we barely get to see them. The town as a collective just decides they aren't going to fight back against the zombies.

Tilda is great in her role. They all do great in their roles. So if your familiar with Jim's work (which I am) and are sick of traditional zombie flicks (which I also am) give this a go.

It really has no plot, or even a consistent tone, and has the pedantic, unoriginal ""consumerism makes us zombies"" commentary laid out for the audience in unnecessary detail. A character actually takes the time to explain this metaphor to you in case zombies chanting ""wifi"" went over your head. At times, it feels like the movie is trying to emulate Monty Python but can never really land the surreal comedy quite right, possibly due to the inconsistent tone.

Tilda's performance alone is gold here, but all the performances are hilarious.

Second, Jim Jarmusch always has some alternate themes going, so don´t expect it to be your classic George A. Romero like Zombie-Slasher-Gore-Fest!The Dead Don´t Die is a movie about a small town where things start to take a weird turn after companies start fracking at the poles - supposedly in search for oil. This has a weird effect on the Earth´s rotation and axis, suddenly the sun doesn´t set as it should, the days get longer, etc. There´s a weird glow around the moon and suddenly all animals make a run for it...Summary in 2 words: Great Movie!Making fun of the whole Zombie Hype that has been going on for the past 15+ years (Walking Dead, Fear the Walking Dead, Day of the Dead, Z Nation, Black Summer, Army of the Dead, etc) - neither of those really turn around and show how and what people do in the event of a zombie apocalypse - not really anyhow - they mostly start after the fact.This movie is more in the category of ""Zombieland"" - meaning it´s meant to be fun, but not overtly fun, more like ""Wow, hey, this might be Zombies"" and quirky characters everybody knows.Therefore, I think it´s a great movie, because it doesn´t follow the classic gory pipeline of scare and shock.

1374,nelly0042,Was this film really needed?,6,30 June 2019,"As I watched this I kept wondering what was the point of making the film?
Zombie flicks have been around for a very, very long time, as have zombie apocalypse comedies. Some have been straight up parodies, but a few of these, most notably Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, actually used the genre to convey a deeper message. In Shaun of the Dead, for example, the film explores Shaun's evolution from aimless slacker to responsible adult. I am still struck by the poignancy of Shaun's reaction to the death of his stepfather Philip, a moment that lent credibility to Shaun's maturation by film's end.
Unfortunately, as much as I looked forward to Jarmusch's treatment of the genre, I felt he fell short and didn't deliver much new. There didn't seem to be any significant exploration of humanity, no insight into the human character. It just seemed to be played out for laughs, tough delivered in a quirky way.
Don't get me wrong. There were a few bits that I appreciated, such as when the actors broke character and made comments about the film's theme song and script, but even these were not original enough to sustain the film. As best as I can figure, the Tom Waits character Hermit Bob was supposed to be the ""conscience"" of the film, who at the end of the film is decrying humanity for being ""zombies"" to a materialistic culture. This is lent some support by scenes where the zombies are shown gravitating back to materialistic activities from when they were alive. At one point, for example, a parade of zombies is shown walking along holding smart-phones uttering such things as WiFi, Bluetooth and Siri, a scene that was mildly funny but that to me seemed to go on for a bit too long. Films warning about the evils of materialism are hardly original. It's a trite message that has been grossly overused and loses considerable impact when delivered by actors with net worths in the multi-million dollar range.
Ultimately, though there were a few mildly amusing scenes, I didn't find the film to have much depth. Shame.",The Dead Don't Die

Tilda Swinton literally kills it in every scene she's in, and Adam Driver and Bill Murray deadpan their way through their hilarious matter-of-fact dialogue, with great scenes from Selena Gomez and the dude who played Allison Williams' lacrosse psycho brother in Get Out.

He turns the entire zombie genre on end. I can't tell you how many times I've been pissed off watching The Walking Dead, or other zombie stories, at the fact NO ONE has ever heard of a flesh eating ghoul. That played well in 1968 with George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, but, c'mon, it's the 21st Century. Everyone knows what a zombie is! When Ronald ( Adam Driver ) suggests after the first zombie attack that it's zombies, that saves a lot of unnecessary exposition, allowing a dive straight into the material.
And, his line, "" This won't end well..."", and why he knows it won't end well, is cinematic genius.
The film has surprise twist you won't see coming ( even if you read the script ), and turns with characters we've seen in other zombie films, with different outcomes here . Bob the Hermit ( Tom Waits ), and Selena Gomez's characters usually meet different dates in every other zombie film.

Seemingly random side plots that are either confusing, nonsensical or simply dead ends (Tilda Swinton's Scottish samurai turned funeral home director who is actually an alien...but, if you don't think it's funny it's simply because you don't understand that Jarmusch was doing a satirical take on zombie tropes and you are not enlightened enough to realize his genius). And the 4th wall garbage with Adam Driver's character that some people call genius and I think is purely lazy writing.In the end, people will watch it anyway because they are hoping these reviews are wrong or that they are one of the ""enlightened ones.""

Instead, we get a mess of subgenres, moods, half-baked humor, slow plot development, unnecessary characters, and a flawed commentary on environmentalism thrown into the mix for some reason. There were pieces of dialogue that gave me hope for interesting developments, even if they were a bit silly (Driver and Murray's discussions about the script that almost break the fourth wall, the polar fracking debacle, etc.). The problem with this film is that it never sticks to these ideas long enough to make them meaningful, and in the end, it just feels pointless. Perhaps that was the director's ultimate, nihilistic message? If so, you sucked away an hour and forty-four minutes of our life to get your ""point"" across, sir.

The similarities are numerous.
* The setting in Western PA
* The dead are ""reanimated"" due to some weird natural event (here Earth's axis shift) Romero's strange phenomena - possibly nuclear radiation
* The dead or undead arise from cemetery graves.
* This living hold up in a Farm House - farmer Frank?!
* I think people who walked out after 30 minl. were turned off with Farmer Frank's ""Make America White Again"" hat making fun of MAGA hats
*The moon is weird. Then like the 3rd time you see the moon it has a blue halo - It's a bloody blue cheese crumble! LOL
* Posey Juarez character is portrayed by Rosie Perez. Zelda Winston character is played by Tilda Swinton
* In one scene Chole Sevigne's character Mindy refers to Zelda as ""Tilda"" and not Zelda.
* Bill Murray's character is Chief Cliff Robertson. Cliff Robertson was a popular TV/film actor for several decades starting in the late 60s
* Chief Cliff wonders why the song ""The Dead don't die"" sounds so familiar and Officer Ronnie remarks: ""It's the theme song""
* I'm still watching it for the first time and Ronnie keeps saying ""this will end badly""
* If you don't get the humor and allegory in this flick you're a drone. And it's ""Allegory"" and not ""metaphor"" as another reviewer has suggested it.Just look for the clues that I posted here, rewatch it and enjoy.",The Dead Don't Die

Tom Waits as a forest-dwelling hermit with an ingrained disdain for society who somehow has more wisdom than the rest of the characters combined had so much potential but he is wasted. Tilda Swinton as a Scottish (or is she!), Buddhist samurai - again, so much potential but...well, I don't want to spoil the low-point of the movie so I won't say what happens to her.

This film has a lot of characters set up... but it fails to actually see them develop or change. The humor works in parts, but the moral preening gets old when the final scene has narration from Tom Waits.If the director wants to make the zombie comparison to consumerism, do it like they did in Shaun of the Dead. The film didn't need an explanation to show that people were zombie like before they became real zombies.It would be good for character development to actually mean something. We have three teenagers who stop for gas and get into a hotel room. There was a brief moment of interest between the gas station attendant and the girl. This didn't add to the story. When the three teenagers rent a hotel, that's all there is. There was really no reason for them to be in the film. This happens to a few characters.I don't mind a little political ribbing. It's fine because jokes are awesome. It would have been nice though, to see a little more from Steve Buscheme and Donald Glover. Sure, it had some laughs in one scene, but there was some great potential that didn't pan out.There are more characters like this and it would have been better if Jarmush actually took notes from ""Eight Legged Freaks"" in which the plot brings these characters together and we can see their personalities clash and work together.

It is an absolutely pointless, meandering vanity project that attempts to trick you into thinking it's cleverer than it is. According to the director himself, it was designed to be a dumb movie comprised of dumb bits as a way to make money hanging out with his friends. And what's worse is that the trailer tricks you into thinking it is an entirely different movie - the worst kind of lie you can tell in an effort to lure people away from their hard-earned money and precious time.There is literally no point to anything that happens; Jarmusch has no sense of pace or urgency or meaning. And in my opinion, art for the sake of itself alone is condescending towards your audience. I normally like his work, along with all of the actors, the subject matter and tone - this should have been right in my wheelhouse. But I left feeling like the director had a contemptuous view of the people watching his film (in EVERY regard) and that just doesn't sit well with me.

1463,spshalaka,A dull movie with awesome actors with crappy roles.,1,2 November 2019,"So I bit the bullet and watched this movie. I guess it's safe to say it did not end well.Literally just made this account to write a reviewA movie with casts like Bill Murray, Chloë Sevigny, Tilda Swinton, Steve Buscemi and they still couldn't pull it off.The worst part is that out of everyone, only Chloë seems somewhat freaked out about the Zombie Apocalypse. It seems mildly inconvenient for some of them where as others have no survival instinct whatsoever. The worst part is the thing with Aliens which doesn't fit into the story and makes no sense at all.All in all, this is a slow dull movie with disinterested characters which is a bad look for a zombie movie. Do yourself a favor and skip it.",The Dead Don't Die
1464,joerlebach,"I have so many questions....and yes, I watched it all..",3,19 June 2021,"With this cast, this film had so much potential.I love a zombie film, the plot as a basic concept had real potential. Zombies were great, it followed the tropes and seemed to be plodding along quite nicely.But by the final 15 minutes of the film, I found myself saying out loud, oh no they didn't...a self aware plot had me rolling my eyes when characters were talking about the script and the director and knowing how it would end.There were a set of side characters that you follow through the film and it turned out that they had no purpose at all, and nothing was ever mentioned of them again.I get it, people saying this is the directors style. But it isn't layered, I mean it it...but when you peel back the layers you realise there is nothing at it's core. Personally it was just very thin and lazy story telling. It just felt like they had no idea what to do at the end. I don't mind filling in some gaps, but I have so many questions that were generated by big plot holes.I wanted so badly to like this film, but nope. I didn't.",The Dead Don't Die

1466,kkayne-02635,WTH people?!?!,7,12 February 2020,"First review I've ever written. I don't understand it. Did you ever stop to think if you didn't like the movie it may be your taste and not so much the movie? I will be the first to admit that this movie gives a whole new meaning to ""dry humor"". Are there strange characters (Tilda Swinton in particular) that make no sense? Yes. I think that was what made this movie so good.Granted the trailers may make it appear to be an all out hysterical movie, I agree with people in that. Then again, I think that helped add to the overall humor of the movie.So, if you like dry humor and oddball characters then you really won't be disappointed with this one.On a final note, if the movie isn't your taste don't bash it as being absolute trash. I mean, I've seen lots of ""critically acclaimed"" movies, movies that win tons of Oscars, etc. and I find myself asking ""what the hell did I just watch?"". Or question how I'll ever get that time back but then again those movies just aren't my taste. Thanks!",The Dead Don't Die

1468,seandavidmorris,Its Deadpan People,8,12 September 2019,"I can't believe it is 2019 and so many reviewers have obviously never heard of deadpan comedy. I am surprised that so many people live such action pack and exciting lives that a real, albeit emotionless, pace of conversation is too dull to be entertaining. The way the characters react when things start getting strange and appear that they are not going to end well is great. The slow dull juxtaposition during an otherwise chaotic event is vintage deadpan comedy. The characters continue to be human beings just as they were in normal times when the apocalypse is upon them instead of acting like a wild animal... or several wild animals. Although I will not go as far as to call it genius the special brand of deadpan is enjoyable throughout the movie. The Tilda Swinston twist is a little off though.",The Dead Don't Die

I have a fairly high threshold for poor films I've sat through such blockbusters as Sharknado, Boggy creek 2 and The Monster club but seldom have I had the desire to scratch out my own eyes.
Today marks a new low in lockdown entertainment and I don't think I will be the same again.

The first 15 minutes are littered with the same lines over and over and over and over. It spent so long bashing these same few points over our heads that I started wishing it would just finish the job and knock me unconscious.Instead, I was fully awake for some of the worst dialogue in a mainstream movie I've heard in a long time, and some of the most r/im14andthisisdeep ideas to ever be put on the screen.This movie left me as bored as the leads seemed. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you have a thing for pretentious, wooden, repetitive scenes and screaming ""I know that actor from somewhere!""",The Dead Don't Die

I did not get that, and not only was the message heavy handed, but it was ALL ANYONE TALKED ABOUT!!! It felt like they told some of the actors that it was a comedy and to work it like it was supposed to be funny, but the pacing and weird sound design made it unclear what was supposed to be a joke or not. And the obvious jokes were so out of place because of the overall tone, that they ended up falling flat.There were side 'plots' that went nowhere, and several characters that did not need to exist. To me, the only entertaining part of the movie was Tilda Swinton's character, and that was just because she was so bizarre that anything she did was interesting in comparison to the rest of the cast.",The Dead Don't Die

1484,oscarpav,"A really poor plot, without spirit, just another critic to the consumerism",3,19 June 2020,"Well, the story is just awful, it doesn't go anywhere with subplots within the main storyline (for example, the plot of young children), subplots that add nothing to the story beyond knowing meaningless characters. Let's not forget the awkward moments between the dialogues either, there comes a point where I didn't know whether to laugh or hate myself for watching this movie. Two hours to reach a point that is self-explanatory, yes, consumerism, I do not think it is necessary to go deeper into this topic. On the other hand, he doesn't even bother with a more original design and story for the zombies, the same as always, except that there are now samurai aliens, none of this will bring something interesting to the movie, since, as the title says, ""The Dead Dont Die"" , that's right, a film that is already dead in itself.

1491,kazikp,It is what it is,7,16 August 2020,"Typical Jarmush. Is it slow paced? Check. Is it dialogue heavy? Check. Is it absurd at times? Check.
To the people that complain it's not action packed enough I would reply it's as action packed as Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.
Also I think because this movie has zombies in it people give it lots of low reviews, because it's a case of missed expectations.
There's a simple filter you can use to decide whether to watch it. If you enjoyed any of the previous Jarmush movies you won't be heavily disappointed. While not an instant classic it's true to his style. If not, maybe start with one of his earlier movies (Broken Flowers, Night on Earth, Ghost Dog, Dead Man) to get a taste of Jarmush first.",The Dead Don't Die
