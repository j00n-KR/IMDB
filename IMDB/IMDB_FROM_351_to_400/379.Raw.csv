0,SnoopyStyle,French body horror,7,22 February 2018,"Justine has been raised as a vegetarian all her life. She enters veterinary college following her older sister Alexia. Her vegetarism and animal rights view is looked down upon. The freshmen class is hazed and forced to eat meat. Justine is surprised to find Alexia has turned into a meat eater. Justine starts to change after the taste of meat and after a waxing accident, her eating habit changes radically.This is a Belgian horror. It has some satire aspect to collegiate freedom for young people. It has plenty of gore with a couple of stomach churning scenes. Filmmaker Julia Ducournau delivers a female centric horror in an unique way. This is fresh with a couple of memorable scenes.",Raw
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Good, but could have been better as well",6,20 July 2018,"""Grave"" is a French horror drama movie from 2016 and actually, without showing up at the really big events, a truly meaningful player during the awards season back then. This made it a huge success and breakthrough film for writer and director Julia Ducournau as well as lead actress Garance Marillier. The vegetarian aspect that is mentioned so prominently in the plot description can really be neglected. Even the interesting scene early on when we see it is basically pressed upon the protagonist by her mother is not as significant as it sounds, well at least not until the very end when we find out something intriguing about this perspective. The film runs for almost 100 minutes and basically depictes a young woman being sucked deeper and deeper into the abyss of carnal desires and with that I only mean sex to a lesser extent, but it's really all about the meat and she cannot get enough of it, even in pretty violent and disturbing manners. The best example is of course when she eats her sister's finger after a freak accident instead of trying to keep it cold, so it can be ""reinstalled"" by doctors immediately. The sister is a good example here for the example of a seemingly wild character, also extreme to some extent, but the longer the film goes, the more we find out she is nothing compared to Justine, our ""hero"" here, a seemingly shy and reserved girl who turns out the exact opposite. Marillier felt perfect for the character and I can see why many found the film and story so appealing with what she invests in the role. I am not sure if it was a great performance, but it is hopefully something that can keep her in the industry for a few years more, hopefully even decades. And there's no denying her physical appeal, for example in the shower scene or the bloody sex scene with the allegedly gay room member. Another great moment from her is also a great moment for Ducournau and I am speaking of course about the scene under the blanket in bed where she tries to keep her desires back, but not a chance as they have overtaken her long ago. Aside from her, those parts about her family, her fellow students, her friends etc. are all fairly decent, but those moments where the film really stands out are those that she has alone I would say like the scene I just mentioned. It's tough to put a finger on what I mean, but I must say for greatness and including it in my favorite list of the year, something is missing still, but it may very well make my list of top5 horror films from 2016 and also always nice to see something of quality coming from France with this genre these days compared to how bad things are looking here in Germany. Go check out ""Grave"". It's easy to appreciate this one as a quality film, a guilty pleasure, a film with a most desirable protagonist or something that is just very different compared to everything else in film these days, also everything else in horror film. Especially recommended on the big screen. Thumbs up.",Raw
2,claudio_carvalho,Erotic and Gross,6,27 May 2017,"The vegetarian Justine (Garance Marillier) has never tasted meat since she is allergic and protected by her mother. When the rookie Justine joins the veterinary school, she is hazed and forced by the older students including her sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf) to eat meat. Soon she feels attracted to eat not only meat but also human flesh and learns a family secret.The overrated ""Raw"" is an erotic and gross European horror film with an original story of cannibalism. The plot is weird, shocking and confused and most of Justine and Alexia's attitudes are not explained including their evil relationship with each other. Why Justine lets her gay roommate deflowers her is also strange. However, the story is well- resolved in the end with the explanation of Justine's father but does not justify the hype. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Grave"" (""Grim"")",Raw
3,nogodnomasters,You tasted like curry.,8,4 July 2017,"Justine (Garance Marillier ) is being sent off to veterinary school where her older sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf) attends. They are both legacies. It seems French Vet schools have a hazing period for all students. During this time they are forced to party and eat raw meat which didn't sit well with Justine who is a life long vegetarian. Justine discovers she is allergic to meat. She gets a nasty rash and later Jeffrey Dahmer syndrome which makes dating tough.The film develops very slow. It is a dark comedy with a horror background. The make-up was spectacular from rashes to bite marks. I watched the film in French with English subtitles. It is not for everyone, but is for those who might like to watch a foreign indie from a new director.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity.",Raw
4,kosmasp,(eating) habits,7,16 November 2017,"The movie is also called Raw, which is also very apt. Actually more apt than Grave I reckon, which is a bit weird. But I guess someone thought this was fitting for some reason. But this movie is about a student, who after being hazed at Campus and other things that apparently are initiation rituals, develops some issues. Who can blame her? But the movie strays from that direction.If you've read the summary, which I'm guess is revealing, you know where this is heading. And it does try to shock as much as possible. While it could have been even more explicit in its depiction of certain things, it still will make some people sick. Just the thought of it. But people who've seen a couple of horror movies, may not feel too uncomfortable. Though I wouldn't use the word tame either. The reveal at the end is not really a shocker, but it's a story that told interestingly enough.",Raw
5,jboothmillard,Raw,6,25 October 2018,"I first heard about this French-Belgian film in the programme Secrets of Cinema with film critic Mark Kermode, it looked weird, then I read more about it, and it sounded weird, so I was very much intrigued to give it a go. Basically Justine (Garance Marillier) is a lifelong vegetarian, in her first semester at veterinary school, the same one her older sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf) is attending and where their parents met. On her first night, she meets her roommate Adrien (Rabah Nait Oufella) and is forced to partake in strange welcoming rituals, she feels uncomfortable, but Alexia reassures her. The next day, the new class is splattered with blood and are forced to eat raw rabbit's kidneys, as a vegetarian, Justine refuses. Alexia encourages her, saying she will like it, Justine still refuses, eventually Justine is convinced and does reluctantly eat one, she walks out with Adrien and gags. Later that night, Justine discovers a strong, itchy rash all over her body, a doctor diagnoses her with food poisoning and gives her a cream for the rash. The next day, Justine begins having cravings for meat, she is ashamed of herself, she and Adrien take a late-night trip to a gas station, so no one will see them eating meat, they have burgers. Unsatisfied, she eats raw chicken in the morning, and later throws up a long bundle of hair. That night, Justine finds Alexia is using the same cream the doctor gave her. Alexia gives Justin a bikini wax, when she tries to cut the wax off with sharp scissors, Justine kicks her away, causing Alexia to accidentally cut off her own finger. Alexia faints in shock horror, Justine picks up her finger and tastes it, and ends up liking the taste and eating it, Alexia wakes and is shocked catching Justine eating her severed finger. The next morning, Alexia takes Justine to a deserted road, she causes a passing car to crash into a tree. Alexia starts eating one of the two passengers as Justine tries to stop her. Justine's craving for human flesh grows and she starts lusting for Adrien. That night, at a party, blue paint is thrown at Justine as part of another ritual, she is forced to make out with a guy covered in yellow paint, until they turn green. As Justine and the boy does as dared, she mistakenly bites his bottom lip, leaving the other party guests shocked. After the party, Justine takes a shower, during which one of her teeth fall out which she picks up and eats. Justine confides in Adrien and they end up having sex, during which Justine tries to bite Adrien, she stops herself by biting into her own arm, she relaxes seeing the blood run, Adrien is shocked but tries to ignore what she has done, caressing her. Later, during a party, Justine gets extremely intoxicated and Alexia takes her to the morgue. The next morning, many people are staring at Justine and avoiding her, she has no memory of the night before, but Adrien shows her CCTV of her crawling like an animal, trying to take bites out of the arm of a corpse, with Alexia accompanying her. Furious at Alexia, Justine finds her sister and pushes her to the floor, the two fight, during which Alexia bites Justine's face and they bite each other's arms, other students eventually pull them apart, they calm down and walk back together to the dorms. That night, Justine wakes up in bed with Adrien, who appears to still be asleep, but removing the blankets she finds it is covered in blood, he is dead, with his right leg eaten. She finds a stab wound in his back and finds a bloody and mostly catatonic Alexia slumped in the kitchen, she murdered Adrien. Furious Justine picks up the weapon used to kill Adrien, she plans to kill her with it, but she changes her mind and drops it, simply taking her to the shower to clean up. Alexia is taken to prison for the murder of Adrien, and Justine is sent back home. Despite everything, the sisters seem to be on good terms. At home, Justine's father (Laurent Lucas) tells her that what happened is neither her fault nor Alexia's, he explains that he could not understand why their mother (Joana Preiss) didn't want to be with him until the first time they kissed, he then lifts his shirt, revealing many scars and chunks of his chest, he says Justine will find a solution. This is certainly in the kind of vibe of dark coming-of-age stories, like Carrie and The Craft, a young woman who will never eat meat develops a horrific hunger for it, and develops an aggressive sexual blossoming and has grisly cannibalistic outbursts, it is probably most memorable for the over-the-top and hard-to-watch bloody flesh-eating sequences, but those who can stomach it will also appreciate its stylish plot, twists and wittiness, an exploitative and bizarre but worthwhile horror drama. Good!",Raw
6,Tweekums,Raw,9,9 February 2020,"Justine is an intelligent young woman who is about to start training to become a vet; she is attending the school both her parents went to and where her elder sister, Alexia, is already studying. The first years are expected to go through a gruelling week of initiations; this includes being woken and forced to get up in the middle of the night, dressing according to their seniors' orders and in one case eating raw rabbit kidneys... this is difficult for Justine as she is a lifelong vegetarian; like the rest of her family. At least so she thought; Alexia persuades her to eat the kidneys. Not long afterwards Justine develops a rash and starts craving meat... including human flesh! She also becomes sexually aware.This Franco-Belgian film from writer/director Julia Ducournau manages to be disturbing without relying on a large body count or an excess of gore. There is a threatening atmosphere from early on as the first year students are hazed by their seniors. After Justine consumes the kidneys it gradually becomes apparent that something is wrong. This leads up to a genuinely shocking scene involving the severing of a finger. While there isn't too much gore there is some and much of it is all the more disturbing because it comes as a surprise, like the finger incident, or because it feels strangely believable within the context of the film. Garance Marillier really impresses as Justine making her character gradually change from a timid girl to a predator merely in the way she looks at her fellow students; Ella Rumpf also impresses as Alexia. The story takes a few surprising turns and looks great thanks to some artistic camerawork. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of horror films looking for something different.These comments are based on watching the film in French with English subtitles.",Raw
7,Quinoa1984,Tasty! Gross! Mesmerizing! Ugly! Beautiful! So many things at once but what a director and star!,8,2 October 2021,"How about that? In France, joining Skull and Bones means something quite different (and perhaps more literal, oui).Raw is a viscerally exciting, savage and in your face to a level that is upsetting and shocking, and I love just looking at the thing and how it unfolds with a smorgasbord of surreal sights that are fully places in how much one's and others flesh can be the most unnerving sight (un but very) imaginable. Guaranteed Milliner it should be said right up front is key to it feeling so on edge and physically charged. There are also some... wild logical leaps one has to take with at least some if not the primary characters - ie how the whole ""Jump and Crash a Car to Eat Brains"" thing works, and why that one guy is so fine with getting laid after Justine did *that* to the other guy - and there isn't much in the shall one say development for these two past Justine becoming completely consumed by the need to... consume, and occasionally trash around in mania. Maybe the casual murder and insatiable need to sink teeth and taste *anything* is enough.But, aside from the pace being tight and finding increasingly disturbing ways of freaking out an audience, even (especially) the ones who think they've seen it all (that one dolly in where the guy gets his eyeball licked, merde!), this is all the same thrillingly alive debut as far as how Ducournau's camera gets so intensely close and intimate with these faces and pieces of meat, which those being human beings most of all but sometimes a cow's ass and a horse or two as well, and frankly it's exciting to see a filmmaker so in tune with depicting youth so out of control... and what going OUT of that means. It's a vampire movie that understands intertwining sexual need and the need for filling a stomach.Or as my wife (an only child) said before this finished: ""This is what I always pictured siblings would be like.",Raw
8,grantss,Heaps of potential but ultimately average,5,25 October 2017,"Justine is a first-year veterinary student. Her elder sister is studying the same course at the university. Justine was raised a strict vegetarian but, as part of the hazing rituals, is forced to eat meat. Initially this has adverse effects but she soon develops a craving for meat...particularly human flesh. Heaps of potential but ultimately average. Quite intriguing, Justine's journey and transformation. She starts off as an innocent, shy vegetarian and ends a wild human-flesh-devouring thing. Some good sub- plots too.Unfortunately, despite all this promise, the movie doesn't really end anywhere profound or interesting. Quite anticlimactic in the end, which was a pity.",Raw

Croneberg body horror and Romero identification crises merge in this French thriller about a young veterinarian school pupil (Marillier) who suddenly finds uninhibited cravings for fresh meat after a humiliating hazing week involving blood and forced fed of raw meat. To her shock she also learns she is not the only one who shares this transformation with her older sister (Rumpf) on campus resulting in many graphic moments of unbridled hunger. Filmmaker Julia Ducournau - who wrote and directed - echoes shades of Brian DePalma's CARRIE with an outsider ill-at-ease in her environs while attempting to harness her newly found discovery of what may define her.",Raw
10,evanston_dad,She's a Man Eater,6,11 January 2018,"This provocative stomach churner of a horror movie too often walks an uneasy line between truly horrifying and excessively silly. I will give it points for treating the coming of age and sexual awakening of a young woman in a way I've never seen that particular genre treated before. In ""Raw,"" a young girl coming out of her shell means she develops a taste for raw meat of any kind, and she'll stop at pretty much nothing to get it.To be fair, it seems to run in the family, as both her sister and apparently mother (in a last minute reveal) have the same tendencies. Gives new meaning to the term ""man eaters."" The film tries over time to shock us, and it gets progressively less effective as it ups its own ante. By the time it gives us yet another scene of bacchanalia at a vet school(!), where some random woman is licking the eyeball of some random guy while our protagonist is hunched in the background like a demented savage, practically gnawing on a bone and picking gristle from her teeth, I was chuckling, probably not the reaction I was supposed to have. Grade: B",Raw
11,trashgang,I was left with a hunger,7,20 June 2017,"So it went, the movie that people ran out of the screenings. people given vomit bags at the entry, the stakes were high for this Belgium France co-op. So for me it was a go to see what it was all about because I do remember A Serbian Film (2010) which had the same commotion and it was indeed a hell of a movie. With Raw I was left with a hunger.It was told that it was going to be in your face and in some points it did but after 20 minutes I was already in panic. Where's the horror, where's the gore? And after 24 minutes the first horror comes in and from then the toilet scene did remind me of all those Asian horrors with the long-haired girls and stuff coming out of their mouth. But hey, I am a bit negative I guess. It's not all that bad, the effects are stunning but to say that it is all that gory as being told. On that part, the horror, the cannibalism and the gore it's a letdown. People could get offended by some parts but overall it's a bit too low on the red stuff. Is it still worth seeing. Oh yes, because it really is above mediocre but for gorehounds this isn't going to be their stuff. It's a bit like Eat (2014). It delivers for some. To be honest, i like but the overrated fuss about it teared this a few point downward on the rating.Gore 1/5 Nudity 1/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Raw
12,deloudelouvain,Not bad for a cannibal movie,6,28 February 2018,"It's rare to see a French or Belgian horror movie, or at least a good one. Martyrs was and is still one of the better ones. Raw isn't as good as Martyrs but it is worth a watch. There are a few good parts of gore, like there should be in a good cannibal movie, but not that it becomes unwatchable, unless you have a very weak stomach. The story isn't bad even though a bit more explanation at the end could have been better for the movie. The acting was also not bad. The sisters Justine and Alexia, played by Garance Marillier and Ella Rumpf, gave a good performance playing their respective cannibal characters. It's not a big Hollywood budget, but for the budget they had they made a watchable movie, if you like this genre that is.",Raw
13,namashi_1,Traumatizing & Mesmerizing!,9,24 August 2017,"'Raw' (French: Grave) is a fearless, disturbing & ultimately unforgettable film, that has the courage to be itself. As my summary states, its Traumatizing & Mesmerizing! Writer-Director Julia Ducournau delivers a tale of violence & cannibalism with the power of a sledgehammer. And lead performer Garance Marillier delivers an outstanding performance!'Raw' Synopsis: When a young vegetarian undergoes a carnivorous hazing ritual at vet school, an unbidden taste for meat begins to grow in her.'Raw' is about exploring the inner self & how exposure, to any form or any meat that it maybe, can change your life altogether. The protagonist here, Justine, played by Garance Marillier, a pure vegetarian, is forced to have meat by bullies in her very beginning in the vet school, develops a taste for meat & flesh, which is akin of a dangerous vampire. Her transformation from an innocent vegetarian, to a cannibal obsessed with meat & human-flesh is shocking to the core. 'Raw' narrates her disturbing & graphic journey, with relentlessness. There were times when I looked away from the screen, due to its gruesome content. The faint-hearted, STAY AWAY!'Raw' is a massive winner because Julia Ducournau is a storyteller of solid merit. Her Writing questions violence & cannibalism with tremendous power & graphicness. While its easy to be put off by the protagonist's violent behavior towards human-flesh, Julia's Superiorly Written Screenplay questions the act of violence in all forms, including our daily food habits, which results in animal killing. Its a twisted tale, with a thought-provoking undertone. Julia's Direction is engrossing. She has handled this disturbing story, with command. Here's a storyteller with some capability! A special mention for the nicely Cinematography by Ruben Impens.Performance-Wise: Garance Marillier as Justine, is spell-binding. Right from her timid body-language in the beginning to her transformation into a cannibal, is simply incredible. The actress plays this difficult role with unbelievable conviction. Its an outstanding performance, that arrests your attention completely. Ella Rumpf as Alexia, Justine's sister, is another performer to watch. She's excellent!On the whole, 'Raw' is among the big winners of recent times. Its brave, graphic & undeniably original. Don't Miss It! But I strongly suggest you watch it with an empty stomach. Don't tell me later I didn't warn you.",Raw
14,Hellmant,"Disturbing, but also incredibly fascinating!",9,14 April 2017,"'RAW': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A French-Belgian horror-drama about a vegetarian college student, that learns she has an uncontrollable hunger for raw meat. It was written and directed by Julia Ducournau (an amazingly talented new filmmaker), and it stars Garance Marillier, Ella Rumpf and Rabah Nait Oufella. The film has received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it also won the FIPRESCI Prize at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. I found it to be very involving, and quite interesting. Justine (Marillier) has been a vegetarian, and animal lover, all of her life. She grew up in a vegetarian family, and now she's attending vet school; which her older sister Alexia (Rumpf) also attends. During a college hazing, Justine is forced to eat rabbit kidneys (by Alexia). She then develops a horrible rash, and a strong urge to eat raw meat (which she had never felt before). Her desire for meat later becomes much stronger, when she also develops an uncontrollable thirst for human flesh as well.The movie is very disturbing, but also incredibly fascinating. It's a film that was really uncomfortable for me to watch, but I also couldn't really look away. The characters are all really interesting in it, and I could really relate to the vegetarian/animal lover aspect to it too (although that's hardly what it's about). It's also great to see a strong female lead horror/drama movie as well, from a very talented new female filmmaker too! I can't wait to see her next film.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/b6j-_hcq7Wo",Raw
15,thesar-2,Man. I'm Rawenous.,7,4 November 2017,"Wow. I had no idea veterinarian school could be sowild.I am uncertain if this movie is anti-vegetarians, anti-gay or just anti-human, but I am certain it's a good thing I eat meat. Don't suppress, progress!A family of vegetarians sends daughter #2 of 2 off to the same vet college as daughter #1 and immediately, it's Animal House for reals. During the horrible hazing rituals that turn party-mode, sisters meat up and things begin to change.The movie has layers and a cannibal-of-age story for Daughter #2. As in French Horror fashion, it's thoroughly gruesome at moments but chooses, this time, to focus more on Daughter #2 coming to terms for her new hungerfor lives.Maybe it's a culture thing – again, full-blown French cinema here, but I had to watch the ending several times to get the meaning and when that didn't work, I took to YouTube that nicely explained the whole ordeal for me. Normally, I don't do that as I like to write my reviews/thoughts on my own, but this movie did not give me, personally, anyways, enough to go on to fully embrace the film.It's recommended, but for die-hard movie/horror fans. It's deeper than portrayed and isn't for those on a full stomach.***Final thoughts: JUST missed this for October's Horror Movie Marathon month where I watch a horror movie every day of October.

17,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Not just a 'cannibal movie', this is a coming-of-age drama that explores feelings of alienation and repressed taboo desires (cranked up to eleven).",8,16 May 2018,"To sell 'Raw (2017)' as simply a 'cannibal movie' is to do it and its creators a major disservice, as is to avoid watching due to its apparent 'extreme' nature. This is an assured coming-of-age drama that explores relatable feelings of alienation and, maybe not so relatable, repressed taboo desires (cranked up to eleven). Its fleeting moments of realist gore are potent and cringe-inducing, as they are supposed to be, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this fantastic flick. It's effecting on many levels, an indie film with artistic direction and a masterfully realistic edge, and is a remarkable achievement throughout. 8/10",Raw
18,ThomasDrufke,Crave,7,15 November 2017,"Raw was a film that intrigued me from the first time I heard the synopsis on an episode of Collider Movie Talk, but it's far from a movie that would typically be of interest to me. Horror films in general aren't my cup of tea, but films like 'Raw' that deal with horrifying subject matter but don't actually have the aspects of a mainstream horror film, end up freaking me out more. Raw does just that. A film about a vegetarian who begins to crave human flesh is just about the most unsettling thing you can base a movie on. Slow building, relentless in showing blood and gore, and frighteningly real performances, Raw gives life to the psychological horror in more bites than one. It's also interesting to watch a film that deals with a family with a mysterious history while presenting a cool tale of nature vs nurture. In all, this film is as unsettling as it is fascinating. Not a film I would ever watch again, but an impressive feat nonetheless.7.5/10",Raw

What starts as nasty hazing at a veterinarian school for a young French woman soon turns into something far more disturbing. Everyone seems menacing and it's one shock moment after another, though to the film's credit, it keeps you guessing as to where it's going. Part of what keeps it entertaining is that it never lets you up for air, but at the same time, all the extra stuff in there - the severe bullying, gross scenes involving animals, nudity, and wild partying - seems to take away from the main story line, and for me at least, a little less would have been more.",Raw

22,Reno-Rangan,An extreme desire for blood and flesh!,6,24 December 2017,"Totally unexpected. I had no idea what I'm about to watch. Because usually I do small research of films I watch before the click play. I did not know it was even a French film or a horror. But it was not actually a horror in a sense. Seeing the initial set up, I thought it would be about a freshman medical student. Then things turned out strangely. Like it was decades ago when I was young, I have felt uncomfortable for those intentional film. For this, it felt all real. As the contents, I disliked them. But the film succeeded if that's what it's intended to give to its audience.It lived up to what the title meant. But on the other hand, I thought it was making fun of vegetarians. You usually won't find many vegetarians in Europe, but this film's topic was bizarre. Because you know someone who has never consumed meat in his entire life, but then when he begins this new habit, it is like completely going out of control. It's not just one, but two from the same family. Something was very clear, that one not knowing the differences. Because they were never before used to it.Justine is all set to join her sister to practice to be a veterinarian. Coming from a pure vegetarian family, she has to go through some of college traditions. From the beginning itself, it did not go well for her. It affected her health and body. A drastic change in a short period of time, forcing her to uncontrollable desire. Then on one accidental situation, it turns even worst. Ultimately, a conflict between the sisters arise. It takes them to unexpected paths and finally how it all ends were revealed with many uneasy events.-xX] An animal that has tasted human flesh isn't safe. [Xx-I have seen many films like this, but this one was a stand-alone from all of them. I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but they have got all things right just as they wanted. Obviously this is for grownups, though not all of them can watch without feeling disgust. Some of article, reviews says, people left the cinema hall halfway through. A very challenging film to watch. You might think I'm exaggerating for a simple cinematic performance, but that's what I really experienced. Only when you give it a try, you might get it.A bit confusing as the story progressing. Like what kind of universe, it is set in. Because whatever happens around Justine, seems nobody caring. Where were the professors! So many doubts. It's just what it is. An imaginative perspective, what if kind of situation turned more uglier. But if you analyse it properly, the only issue was the cannibalism. Not that one showing a desire in consuming meat all of sudden. So, I appreciate the writing, direction and performances, but definitely it is not my cup of tea. Probably for most of you as well.So this is not for all, but selected viewers. Films can be anything, only we have to assert whether we liked it or not. The maker knew what they were doing, the kind of subject they have undertaken for their film. Often a film like this hits the screen, and makes some noise among the film critics and film goers. I don't know on what merit one should decide to watch it. Because it is not for entertainment, nor an art, nor a message film. But I still think it is worth a watch. Just be aware of what you are going to watch.6/10",Raw
23,tomgillespie2002,A very rare beast - an excellent cannibal movie,8,20 June 2017,"For her debut feature film, writer and director Julia Ducournau opted for the particularly taboo subject matter of cannibalism. It's a bold and admirable move, as if there's anything that gets audiences members up in arms and storming out of a movie theatre, it's the sight of a non-zombie human being chowing down on another of their kind. Making its way onto movie screens after a successful festival run, Raw arrives with both critical acclaim and a sense of notoriety, having apparently rendering festival-goers faint and puking in the aisles, to the point where the paramedics were called. As it usually the case with movies that have generated similar controversy, Raw really isn't that gruesome, and is in fact very careful and patient when delivering those squirm-in-your-seat moments.The incredibly bright but socially awkward Justine (Garance Marillier) has been mollycoddled by her parents from a young age and raised a strict vegetarian. We meet her on her first day at veterinary school, following the same path as her parents before her, and that of her older sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf), who still attends. As she settles down for a quiet read at night, the dorm is invaded by older pupils who don balaclavas and proceed to trash the place, forcing Justine and her gay roommate Adrien (Rabah Nait Outfella), along with her fellow freshmen, into submissive behaviour before introducing them to a crazy rave. The rituals don't stop there, and the new starters must also spend a day drenched in animal blood and eat raw rabbit kidney. Of course, the eating of meat goes against Justine's beliefs, but she gobbles the kidney down after some guidance from her sister. This first taste of the forbidden seems to awaken something inside of the teenager, and she is soon covered in a nasty body rash and craving raw flesh.Anyone reading the synopsis will likely assume this to be a story of a twisted college campus turning its pupils into blood-drinking monsters, but this is not the case. While the school is rather weird in its inauguration traditions, this is a far more personal story of sibling rivalry and sexual awakening. It could be labelled a feminist piece, but I believe its themes will be familiar to both sexes. Why these themes play out within a story of cannibalism, I don't quite know, but they provide the opportunity for some memorable set-pieces that reach Cronenbergian levels of body horror repulsiveness. The instinctive, almost absent-minded suck on the end of a severed finger will leave you open-mouthed, but Ducournau films the scene with such gravitas that it doesn't just disgust, but also represents the emergence of something primal and confusing within its protagonist. Marillier's youthful beauty and timid curiosity brings life to the character, and the actress puts herself through many difficult scenes that would have most actors turning their nose up at. Visceral and quite unforgettable, Raw is a very rare beast - an excellent cannibal movie.",Raw
24,eddie_baggins,A unique horror experience lead by a brilliant lead performance,7,17 September 2017,"Those heading into Raw expecting a typical horror experience better search elsewhere for France native Julia Ducournau's impressive debut feature is very far from your average run of the mill journey, as we are placed alongside Garance Marillier's 16 year old new vet school student Justine as she discovers a very different side to her vegetarian life after she's introduced to some lovely raw rabbit kidney as part of her schools hazing ritual's for new student's.Saying too much more about Ducournau's frequently psychologically frightening and often blood filled experiences would ruin much of her subtle surprises as Raw takes us on a visually captivating, unnerving and in some instances quietly moving narrative trip.There's been a lot of media hype about Raw and it's more shocking moments, of which there are many and of which many are not for the faint of heart (vegetarians would do well to avoid this film) but Raw is actually not the European gore-fest many might've been hoping for, as Ducournau's film tells a very intimate story of Justine's journey from a young girl into a women as we've never seen done on screen before.Played brilliantly by the young Marillier, Justine is an all at once likable, detestable and bizarrely captivating central figure who continues to make surprising and confronting decisions, as her new meat-filled life takes turns towards the more sinister side of the cuisine world.It's an extremely unique take on the growing up film genre and in particular the college life genre and while Raw lacks in scares, its bleak and unrelenting view of being a ""rookie"" in this vicious and even dangerous lifestyle is scary enough in itself.Not everything in Ducournau's film works, especially the seemingly random acceptance shown from students concerning some of Justine's more outwardly odd behaviours and incidents, while some may be frustrated with certain character decisions but when Raw clicks into its odd and entrancing beat, this is a film you can't take your eyes off of even when you might want to.Final Say – Lead by a brilliant and career making turn from its young star Marillier, Raw marks down Ducournau as a filmmaker to keep a very close eye and while horror buffs that prefer their genre more blood spattered than psychological may be left disappointed, Raw is one of the year's most impressive genre entries. Just don't eat a steak beforehand.3 ½ rashes out of 5",Raw
25,TheMovieDiorama,Raw is a coming-of-age story like no other.,8,25 February 2018,"Now, I like to think I have good tolerance when it comes to scenes that cause great disgust or distress. Aside from stupid films like 'The Human Centipede' that are designed simply as a means to gross you out, Raw is possibly the most grotesque film that actually has meaning and context. A young girl goes to a veterinarian school, and as part of the first week there she undergoes ""Rush Week"" (a hazing type ""Freshers Week"" here in the UK). However, our vegetarian protagonist soon starts to transform and explore the idea of consuming meat, with grim consequences. Honestly, I don't know what to say. My head is circling around the concept of cannibalism that I feel ever so slightly nauseous. I'm not even joking, there were certain scenes where I physically looked away. Whether it be her feasting on a finger like it's a chicken drumstick or somehow pulling a long clump of hair from her throat. Extremely powerful imagery that has induced a fear of vegetarians. Never give them meat. Never. What I really appreciated was the character development of Justine, her arc was surprisingly detailed and meticulously thought out that made her likeable and relatable. Evoking several layers of subtext. Don't give in to peer pressure, the exploration of one's self under a foreign environment, the need for red raw juicy meat in one's life...! There is plenty to love on a conceptual scale. Technically, this film also delivers. Julia Ducournau's direction was rather bold and inventive. The blend of slow motion scenes and long static shots as teenagers gradually walk towards the camera felt fresh. The cinematography was excellent, particularly during the party scenes. Garance Marillier's central performance was electrifying, I mean I could imagine some of the scenes were extremely difficult to act but she aced it. The most grotesque scene arrives about halfway through the film, this means the third act ultimately feels slightly tamer. I also felt the runtime was too short, I wanted more from it! But yes, Raw is a bloody good time.",Raw
26,matthewssilverhammer,I loved it.,9,19 October 2017,"Holy cow, this is a bold and disturbing squirm fest of the highest order. With the cannibalism, the body horror, the bloodinessit's definitely a horror movie, but it's also just a great drama about the realities of sisterhood. Both girls are great, but Marillier is an incredible discovery, going from perfectly meek to slowly descending into excess and insanity.",Raw
27,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Deeply affecting, visceral and noteworthy film debut for Julia Ducournau",8,12 September 2017,"A veterinary school freshman (Garance Marillier) develops a taste for raw flesh in the feature debut of French filmmaker Julia Ducournau. Part horror film, part coming-of-age drama, ""Raw"" is a visceral gut-punch of a film both in story and visuals, to the point that it is not recommended for the squeamish. That said, it's gore isn't distasteful – no pun intended.Marillier's Justine is a vegetarian, which makes her cravings all the more perplexing, but given the nature of the story – a young woman going away to school and experiencing hazing, peer pressure and radically different societal expectations than she's used to – the metaphor Ducournau has constructed feels unsettlingly but strikingly apt.Regardless of whether French veterinary schools have such bizarre, carnal traditions, the narrative bullet points and the emotions they're meant to elicit make ""Raw"" accessible to any audience. At one point, we were all a prude and naïve as Justine, and the way she wrestles with it as her physical and social needs change feels so relatable, even if we can't possibly imagine a scenario in which we would be driven to consume human flesh.What really elevates the material is Ducournau's unapologetic yet mindful approach. She's aiming to unnerve her audience, but in instance when most filmmakers would escalate and double down on the genre elements as the film nears its conclusion, Ducournau never overindulges. She's masterfully deliberate in how much gore to show and how long to hold onto an image or a sequence to achieve the desired effect. So although ""Raw"" comes across as a stomach-churner, the underlying mechanics are largely psychological.In a similar vein, Ducournau also defies conventions and familiar tropes in ways rarely seen from new directors. ""Raw"" doesn't tightly conceal information as though it were a mystery/thriller about what's really happening to Justine (though admittedly the ending is meant to provide a payoff, in a way). She will make certain details visible to attentive viewers that will allow them to get a step ahead. Rather than ruin anything, however, these clues invite us into the story. Nothing ever becomes so predictable that it deflates the film's unusual energy pattern.""Raw"" certainly rides its coming-of-age metaphor; as it goes, so does the film's effectiveness, but the inspired filmmaking that realizes this vision puts Ducournau on the map. Foreign filmmakers with horror tendencies tend to make the transition to Hollywood, or at least American-produced films, more easily than most. That said, her indifference for the clichés that dominate Western horror might keep her on the independent track for awhile, but with hopefully bigger names that draw more attention to her fine work.~Steven CThanks for reading!

29,videorama-759-859391,Raw secrets and dangers exposed,7,3 May 2017,"The only comedown for me with this good film, was I expected it to be much gorier, like when the catalyst and situations slowly crescendo's and then, ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE! in the second half, where it's constant full bore. That aside, Raw, alternatively known as Grave, is a well made and original piece of film making, it's fresh story which is what impressed me the most, with a good script and acting to boot, especially from the lead, who looked familiar, but it must of been some other actress who resembled her. She does resemble, if you can remember back, the gorgeous Mia Sara, from Ferris Bueller's Day, which if you can believe, was part of a preview, of an 80's film collage before the film, along with the other five previews. I really shouldn't be complaining about the gore, on the fact is very realistic, especially the accidental finger chopping scene. The story has our lead, a vego, who goes to this upscale vetenary college, full of horny, partying youngsters, living up the best years of their life Millennium + style. You'll love how they're initiated too, the first bloody moment actually. Our french sexy, lead character, Justine, isn't the easiest at trying to fit in. Her older sister, already at the campus, is, as she says in the own words, ""the weird one"". She's a cross between Helena Bonham Carter (hair) and Kristen Stewart, face, eyes. Pressuring her into another initiation ritual, where she has to eat a monkey kidney, what ensues, after, turns her into a carnivore with an insatiable lust for meat, and a much forbidden taste for human flesh, the finger eating scene, the most shockingly disturbing and weirdorama moment. There are a couple of weird moments, another featuring a dirty old man, like out of a David Lynch film with false teeth, laughing out crazily. There's a twist and some nice thriller aspects, near the open sting in your tail ending, the haunting music score, wonderfully fitting as to what ensues, in the continuation of story, and the fate, Justine must accept. Through it all, the story doesn't veer that far from reality. It's a smart, inventive, and engrossing film, with an unhurried, steady handling of suspense and pacing. The scenes with that horse racing on the treadmill are beautifully memorable as are other moments, but they're mostly ones, you'll see in the preview. We have another initiation love scene, very Avatar themed, as to Justine's paint slap on color, where her partner/stranger is pea green souped. What I liked about Justine's gay, boyfriend, is that he's not treated as the stereotypical, horny college male pig, you normally see in these type of surroundings of story, ill respective of feelings, of whatever. At first you don't really like Adrien, but you do, as the film goes on. The sister relationship is weird too, as if bipolar. There are many plusses to Raw and it's a wonderfully made Indie, and original work of art, all the way through, but kind of just misses it's mark or reach it's full potential. Something a little Raw, stirring in there, somewhere. It does shock, but not all gorehounds, will be satisfied, esp, those who crave blood and constant slaughter, where this movie concentrates more on detail and real life business of story and situations of characters, and you have to respect that. The end music score will get you. The hair pulled out of the mouth by Justine, early in the piece. Can you explain that to me. The vast rash and blister close up, I know that itch.",Raw
30,paul-allaer,"European horror-thriller that is WAY out there, and then some",7,12 April 2017,"""Raw"" (2016 release from France/Belgium; 99 min.) brings the story of Justine. As the movie opens, we see a car try and avoid a walker on a deserted country road, only to strike a telephone pole instead, with disastrous results. We then get to know Justine, who is being dropped off by her parents on the campus of an (unnamed) veterinary school, where her older sister Ales also attends. The welcome is brutal, as the ""rookies"" get hazed during ""initiation week"". Justine, a vegetarian, is forced to eat some meat and before we know it, strange things are happening... To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: let's start with the obvious: this movie brings plenty of gore, and worse, and is not for anyone of the faint of heart, seriously. When the initial hazing happens, it reminds of the infamous ""Carrie"" scene where Sissy Spacek gets soaked in blood. In this movie, that is just the start. I was taken by surprise by some of the scenes and had to look away on a number of occasions (hint: this is playing out at a VETERINARY school...). Once you get over the initial shock of it all, it turns out that this is quite the horror-thriller, and rather unique at that as well. Up-and-coming French writer-director Julie Ducournau brings a kind of brutality to the screen that one typically might not associate with a woman writer-director. Kudos as well to Garance Marillier in the role of Justine. Surely we have not heard the last of either Ms. Ducournau or Ms. Marillier. Last but not least, I would be remiss if I didn't point out that the movie was filmed entirely in Belgium, with the University of Liege standing in for the veterinary school.""Raw"" premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival, to immediate critical acclaim. Imagine my surprise when this opened out of the blue and without any pre-release hype or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati this past weekend. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. I couldn't help but wonder whether anyone else in the audience besides myself was taken aback by some of the scenes. Bottom line; if you are in the mood for a pretty explicit horror-thriller, then ""Raw"" will be right up your alley.",Raw
31,jtindahouse,Subtle and yet oh so effective,8,1 June 2017,"The biggest strength that 'Raw' possesses is that it stays grounded for the entire run time. What I mean by that is that it never feels a need to impress or shock its audience. Now, don't get confused by that. This is a film that will do both those things to its audience, however it never feels like it is solely trying to do as much. There's a very organic feel to the way this film was made.The film is carried by an incredibly strong performance by its lead actress Garance Marillier. I was shocked to see she was relatively new to the acting scene. She showed phenomenal range and versatility throughout the film and had immense presence whenever she was on screen. The journey her character goes on is captivating to watch with her at the helm.There are reports of audience members vomiting and fainting during viewings. There are unquestionably some tough to watch scenes, but this is not a film in the same vein as a 'Hostel' or a 'Saw'. That's not to say those aren't great films in their own right, they're simply different. 'Raw' is very subtle in its approach for the most part. I seem to say this every time I see a French film, but only the French could make a film like this.I really enjoyed 'Raw'. There's a really great atmosphere that makes this film what it is. It's certainly a horror film, yet there is not a single jump-scare (at least not to my memory). I watch more than enough horror films to confirm that that is incredibly rare today. A very impressive effort by all involved.",Raw

As it goes along, the sisters fight and this leads to a ridiculous encounter between the two as the older girl bikini waxes the younger one in a very private area. A dog in the room checks out the pre shave spot. I am not making this up. Even more bewildering is the fact that this stupidity was written by a women. A few unnecessary night club scenes with blaring music are included, making the film even more excruciating. Take my advice and avoid Raw like the plague.",Raw

A life-long vegetarian, she is forced to ingest raw meat, and develops a craving for flesh: animal or human.The movie is quite surreal and never goes down the path you might expect. I believe the whole thing is a metaphor for the physical longings that can erupt at that time in your life and at that place.I have to say I hope college - veterinary or otherwise - is nothing like this in France.

34,Stevieboy666,Strong stuff,8,16 December 2019,"A teenage girl, who follows a strict vegetarian diet, joins her older sister at a veterinary school but after some extreme initiation rituals carried by senior students she develops an uncontrollable craving for raw meat, human and animal.
This movie is very graphic, there is a great deal of blood and gore. Animal lovers may be upset at the sight of animals, including dogs, being cut up. Our central character also discovers sex, her choice of first time lover being a very unorthodox one but such rational fits well in Raw. All rules and conventions are out of the window. This French/Belgian will certainly not appeal to many, it is at times typically arthouse, very graphic (as already mentioned), possibly offensive and to non-French speakers comes with subtitles. But those looking for something different, or fans of extreme European horror will get their money's worth here. It is also very well acted, good camerawork and has excellent special effects/make-up.

37,kluseba,"Escalation sick, sick, sick!",8,16 October 2017,"Raw, originally titled Grave, is one of the most controversial and interesting horror movies in recent memory. In times like these, it's quite difficult to push genre boundaries and shock people but this film certainly achieved both. Some critics praise this movie as being almost revolutionary, others find it repulsive and bizarre. During screenings, some people stayed until the very end, others ran out of the cinema in the middle of the movie and some had to throw up. One thing's for certain: this movie isn't for the faint-hearted. And no matter what the rating in different countries might say: this movie is only for adults. Watching this movie with your underage children, even if they are seventeen years old and very mature, would be irresponsible in my book and I'm certainly not a conservative mind. You have been warned.Without giving too much away, this film is about cannibalism and shows some very graphic scenes. However, there is more to this movie than people eating people. The film criticizes stupid initiation rituals at universities and sends out a very clear message: If you don't like something, don't let anyone force you to like it. Stand your ground and stand by your convictions. This movie also tells us another truth: you can choose your friends but you certainly can't choose your family. I know a lot of people who blindly worship their families no matter what but this film shows that those people can be wrong. The family members of the protagonist are no examples to follow and she would have been better off without them. The third element this film criticizes is how many vegans and vegetarians still face prejudice day by day. I'm certainly everything but a militant vegan but it is important to respect the choices people make even if you might personally disagree with them. The movie shows some problems without preaching anything. This is positive. Some people might become vegans after watching this film but that isn't the intention behind it. By the way, I enjoyed some excellent salmon with capres, mushrooms and pasta after the movie.As you can read, this film offers some interesting elements to think about. Another strong element are the settings of the movie. This French-Belgian movie takes place in the beautiful city of Liège but you won't see any of its beauty. The film introduces us to exchangeable university buildings and student apartments which add to the movie's gloomy vibe. These settings also make the movie more authentic and show how the story told in it could happen anywhere. The general vibe of the movie makes me think of the video game Life Is Strange. The movie takes place in a small town with a lot of students where everybody starts to know one another quickly and where something gloomy is lurking behind the surface. This film might offer some slices of life in the beginning but the sinister atmosphere really keeps it together.The acting is also quite strong, simply because the actors don't overact and convince as fairly normal people. On the other side, it takes guts to play what the two main actresses are performing in this film. Despite the raw images, lead actresses Garance Marillier and Ella Rumpf have their own distinct personalities and remain human despite the inhuman things that are going on.While most horror movies have weak explanations or illogical sequences, Raw comes around with a minor twist at the very end that puts things into perspective as it explains why the things we have witnessed actually happened. There are still some illogical passages here and there but let's keep in mind that this is a low-budget production and also a work of fiction. Despite some errors, I didn't have any trouble getting into this movie.Raw isn't a particularly suspenseful or scary movie. It starts like a coming-of-age drama and slowly evolves towards a body horror movie. The movie's unique approach alone keeps its momentum going until the very end. Despite all the graphic violence, it's well-made and you just can't take your eyes off the screen.In the end, you should watch Raw if you have a strong stomach and sympathize with the body horror and teenage drama genres. Raw is certainly a unique experience. As strange as it sounds, I liked the film for the reasons mentioned above and it certainly is a movie I won't forget anytime soon.",Raw

Her sister goes to the same college and one night, while trying to help her wax, the sister's finger accidentally gets cut off. Instead of finding some ice, she starts to eat the finger. Instead of holding it against her, her sister decides to train her how to get more flesh for consumption: she runs out in front of a car, causes it to crash, then starts to eat the dying passenger. The sister is afflicted too. It all comes to a head when the girl wakes up to find her roommate's leg eaten off, and at first she thinks she did it unconsciously somehow. It turns out it was her sister, who goes to jail. The girls' father then confesses that he knew about their condition.

Hazing starts immediately with the next class where Alexia is, harassing the new class year-round. Justine is a vegetarian, something very important to her mother for reasons we'll learn, and a virgin. Her roommate is a gay guy who doesn't mind getting involved with girls on occasion. Alexia tries to show her the ropes here and there but also takes enthusiastic part in the hazing. At some point the entire new class is made to eat animal entrails. Justine refuses but once Alexia encourages her, she folds. As a results she developes a hunger for flesh that gets worse and worse. She devours meat skewers and even raw chicken in the middle of the night. Raw blood also appeals to her.One night, while Alexia is...get this...waxing her sister's pubes she ends up cutting her finger off and passes out. Justine sees the severed finger and gets hungry. Then Alexia wakes up...and isn't shocked or surprised at all. Instead she teachers her how she can obtain fresh human blood and meat. But Justine is at this point not interested in the lesson. Instead she tries to keep the hunger under control to some extent, but that isn't easy. When Alexia takes an embarrassing video of her that spreads quickly, Justine bites back. Literally. As it turns out, it's Alexia who will take things too far and make things unravel at which point we there's something of a surprise.Raw sure is something to be seen. The question is weather it's something you would want to put yourself through. It's gratuitously gross and nothing is sacred. Personally I'm not fond of animal stuff so I could have done without that. Aside from that, Raw is actually quite funny as well, given the absurd turn of events that take place. Turning into a cannibal is similar to turning into a vampire complete with suffering and aches and pains. Ella Rumpf is just lovely. The first half is somewhat weak, he second half, once the action starts is pretty good.

42,Agent10,Utterly vulgar...yet delectable,7,3 October 2021,"One question must be asked....is this a film about the satirization of misogyny or is it the greatest vegan/vegetarian propaganda film of all time. As a vegan myself, I'm gonna say this is a take on the horror of eating animal flesh.The story is simple. Justine is going to veterinary school with her sister Alexia. Justine and her family adhere to a strict vegan diet (I say vegan because we never see the characters eat any animals products). During a first week hazing, Justine is forced to eat rabbit parts and thus starts going down a dark and destabilizing road. We find out her sister Alexia has already walked this path, going so far as to killing as a result of a new hunger that is filling her body. That hunger is for human flesh, and during this trek the sisters become more unhinged from the previously controlled and stodgy upbringing they most likely endured. I call this portion of the film propaganda due to the unapologetic behavior of the meat eaters in the film, bound by tradition and societal standards they never stop to think that their profession of choice doesn't marry well with their pesonal diet. Not to mention these people also seem completely devoid of logic and empathy, while Justine and Alexis have veered into a territory they do not know how to traverse (regardless of Alexias' confidence toward the subject).I doubt director Julia Ducournau was seeking to make the correlation of evil equating to meat eating, but it is a thinly veiled interpretive position for those that do not eat animal products. I mean, Justine and Alexia are metophorical lioness', correct? They need meat. Does it matter what meat it should be.Of course, my personal politics might not be the central viewpoint of the film, but then again the other viewpoint I presented was thinly veiled as well. Some might not catch the misogyny being lampooned here, but it does center around the idea that women will seek to destroy men unless they are compliant. In essence, they will ""eat the man alive"" literally unless he stands up and makes himself the power figure of the relationship.This is some pretty fun and interesting stuff, and the ending is bleak and satisfying. If you don't mind subtitles, you might like this.",Raw
43,I_Ailurophile,"Vivid, jolting, and phenomenal",10,3 October 2021,"I'm not sure when I last watched a movie so full of distinctly cringe-worthy content, but 'Raw' is pretty unforgettable in that regard. From cruel college hazing to body horror, from the things protagonist Justine eats to direly awkward social interactions, this is absolutely not for the squeamish or easily perturbed. This is to say nothing of conventional scenes at a vet school that are well outside societal norms (e.g. Being shoulder-deep in a bovine's rectum), nor the rather carefree, uninhibited relationships between characters.'Raw' is a marvel, and I absolutely love it.The narrative stirs together elements of horror, coming of age stories, and psychological drama in portraying Justine's jarring journey as a freshman undergoing a rather singular experience. Where there isn't dramatic tension, there's still a riveting intensity in every shot, scene, and story beat, no matter how extraordinary or mundane. For that we can thank the excellent writing and direction of filmmaker Julia Ducournau - dialogue, character, scene, and overall plot alike; the fabulous, invigorating soundtrack compiled by music supervisors Guillaume Baurez and Martin Carau, and the super, entrancing score composed by Jim Williams; and not least of all the cast, enthusiastically inhabiting their roles with immense passion, energy, and skill.Lead Garance Marillier is magnificent as Justine, readily embodying the conflict, confusion, and growing self-awareness of a young woman learning who she is, with uniquely gruesome results. Ella Rumpf nearly matches Marillier's performance note for note as Justine's sister Alexia - save for that Justine's path is far more arduous, while Alexia's hard-boiled severity marks her as the elder, and lesser screen time denotes Rumpf as the support. Rabah Naït Oufella also gives a noteworthy portrayal of fellow freshman Adrien, a convivial if somewhat temperamental young man assigned as Justine's roommate. To mention these select few is hardly to count out anyone else, though - everyone on hand is great.From the perfect, understated opening scene, through every drop of blood, ounce of gore, and flinch of repulsion, through to the smartly devised ending that brings whatever clarity we had not previously divined - 'Raw' is a dazzling, stimulating, unsettling, exhilarating, refreshing block of very carefully considered, refined, and delicately executed horror-tinged cinema. I'd wanted to see this from the moment I first heard of it, and though my opportunity is belated: I had high expectations, and still they were well exceeded. This is a deeply absorbing feature deftly blending its constituent parts and creating something new, original, and exceptional from them.I cannot recommend this any more highly. Content warnings must be noted for those aspects mentioned above that may be unsavory for some viewers, plus nudity and sex. Otherwise, simply put, 'Raw' is an outstanding film that needs to be seen by all.",Raw
44,valleyjohn,Weird and wonderful,7,29 July 2021,"This is a very strange film . I'm not normally a big fan of weird films that have no obvious meaning but there is something about Raw that is is kind of mesmerising.This is the story of a young woman, studying to be a vet, develops a craving for human flesh but she's not the only one....This is an 18 certificate and for good reason but it never steps over the boundaries of indecency. It's classed as a horror film but honestly, it's not .It's like a family vampire movie ( not family as in kids movie ) but without the laws of vampirism.There is sexual tension but it's in no way sexy .Well I didn't think so anyway.Good performances from Garance Marillier and Ella Rumpf add to what is a quite memorable film if not remarkable. In fact you could say the film , like it's title , is completely raw.",Raw
45,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Different Take on the Coming of Age Tale,10,22 October 2021,"This film is one that I watched originally when I first started to do year end lists. It was something that I jumped on late, but this movie blew me away and was my favorite of that year. I had only given it that one viewing and now doing a second one as part of the Podcast Under the Stairs' Summer Series. The synopsis here is a young woman, studying to be a vet, develops a craving for human flesh.We begin by seeing a stretch of road that is quiet. We see someone walking along it. It shifts to the other direction where a car is coming. The focus shifts back and we someone run into the road and falls, causing the car to crash into a tree. The person then gets up and walks around to the driver's side.It then shift to a woman going through a line in cafeteria. Her name is Justine (Garance Marillier). She states she is a vegetarian to the worker and only wants mashed potatoes. She sits down with her mother, Joana Preiss, and father, Laurent Lucas, to eat. Justine spits out a bunch of her food, because there is a meatball in it. Her mother asks if she bit into it and goes to complain. We see that her father is more laid back in comparison to the mother.Justine is taken to school. She is attending a popular veterinary school, like her parents. Her older sister is also attending, but she doesn't show up help her sister move in. That night we see Justine in her room and something loud in the hallway wakes her up. She leaves her bedroom to find her new roommate Adrien (Rabah Nait Oufella). She requested for a girl, but instead was paired with gay gu. He has a ski pole and ready to defend them if he has to. It turns out to be upperclassman and this is a hazing ritual. They are taken from their room, their mattresses thrown out the window and they're herded away.They are taken to a rave. This is a hive of drinking, drugs and debauchery. Justine tries to find her place in everything. She seeks out Adrien who starts to make out with another guy. She then finds her sister, Alexia (Ella Rumpf). She is dancing on an elevated platform. Justine is happy to see her and they go off together. When Justine attempts to go home, Alexia tells her she can't. The rookies can only go when the upperclassman call it a night. Justine comes home at dawn, exhausted.The next hazing ritual is blood being poured on them, followed by being forced to eat a raw rabbit kidney. Justine tries to get out this by stating she is a vegetarian. Alexia is called over and defies what her sister says by eating a piece. She tells Jutine to do it and to not wimp out, forcing her to do so.We then see that Justine is a prodigy student. Everything comes easy to her, but this angers a professor, Jean-Louis Sbille. Adrien is struggling with a test and tries to copy off of her and she doesn't allow it. The professor knows it is happening and wants Justine to admit she is one doing so, or to rat on him. He says the other students hate her due to genius.She has other things to worry about though. A horrible rash has broken out on her body and it itches. She also has grown a craving for meat, especially raw. Inner desires are also growing inside of her as well. She is gaining confidence, but is also losing herself in this process. Some wild things happen that make Justine question things she knew about her and her family.I have to lead off that coming into this, I had heard a lot about this film via podcasts I listen to. My father even tried to watch it first and couldn't get through it. This sparked my interest. With that said, I was blown away after that first viewing. What struck me this time around is that we have a coming of age story for Justine, which I can relate to. She has been sheltered with her parents her whole life and now that she is away at college, she is letting loose. She is trying to find her place and where she fits in. I got in quite a bit of trouble my freshman year, even though I didn't grow up sheltered. There is also the idea of hazing here, as I was also in a fraternity so there is another aspect that is relatable for me.Going from this idea takes me to the real concept of this movie is about how we should live in moderation. Justine wasn't allowed to have meat and when she does at school, it causes her to become a cannibal. This is great. We see the more that we get into it, why she wasn't allowed to eat meat and it is a genetic thing. There's also a bit of an idea of her parents failing her and the sins being visited on her. Back to the coming age, I think the meat is an interesting correlation to the forbidden fruit and desires. Justine is also a virgin in the beginning. She loses herself in all of this along with Adrien and even Alexia.That should be enough that I need to delve into with the story here so I'll think this over to the acting which I thought was top notch. Marillier was perfect in this role. I'm surprised at how talented she was. She is this age and I truly felt like I was watching her actually go through everything that she did. Rumpf did very well as the darker older sibling. She is trying to undo everything their mother instilled, even going as far to cover up things her sister does. Preiss isn't seen a lot, but you can feel her presence when she is on screen. Oufella also does good as someone is gets caught up in this and clearly is just a pawn being used. I thought the rest of the cast rounded out with what they needed their characters to do.Effects in this film were amazing. Everything looked to be practical and it got to me. There is a bikini waxing scene that made me cringe. I can't do the sight of real blood and the film simulates what ends up happening so well that my hands went numb. I shared this, because the effects were that good. The editing of this film is amazing. I like the opening scene and how it gets tied back in during the twist. The film has lower runtime and it is perfect in my opinion. The score of the film didn't stand out to me, but it definitely fit for what was needed.Now with that said, I was blown away by this film. It is more than just a cannibal film. There some deeper issues that are explored with this concept in the forefront. The story is something that can be related to despite the darker things. The acting was good. The effects were great as was the editing. The score works for what was needed without standing out. I will say that this film was from France so I watched it with subtitles on. If that is an issue then avoid this. It also is bloody and some of the effects look almost like it is happening. If you have a weak stomach for that, I would recommend avoiding this as well. If not, I think you are in for a truly great film. I highly recommend this if you can take it.My Rating: 9.5 out of 10.",Raw
46,Amyth47,Eat your veggies...,3,21 December 2018,"My Rating : 3/10Genre-confused pseudo-feminist gore-induced arthouse experiment.'Raw' fails to deliver. The plot is weird, inconsistent, shocking and confused and most of Justine and Alexia's attitudes are not explained including their evil relationship with each other. The film tries too hard to shock us, and it gets progressively less effective as it ups its own ante. There's some enjoyable gore here and there but I never felt completely immersed in the world of the film.If you're really curious, go ahead, I'm not gonna stop you. Good - but could have been so much better.",Raw
47,bkrauser-81-311064,Not as Appetizing as it Seems,6,18 March 2017,"This movie definitely oversells itself. From the rumors of overwhelmed audience members passing out, to the promotional barf bags being doled out at the screening, Raw can't help but prime you for a big bloody letdown. I scare easily, so truth be told, I was shaking in my boots before the promotions guy started butchering the stars' names and joking that we'd all enjoy a steak dinner afterwards. That comment ended up being cheeky in more ways than one.None of this is the movie's fault (the overtly candid title notwithstanding). Raw does come with early promise, as exemplified by the fact that nearly the entire film takes place in a veterinary hospital with an alarmingly lax attitude towards hazing. No matter how humdrum a scene becomes, there's always the possibility of something furry and four-legged being cut open to get you writhing in your seat. It's gross; those unaccustomed will no doubt be shocked. But it never reaches apex sensationalism.Part of the problem lies with the foundations of the story. Our protagonist, the young, innocent and vegetarian Justine (Marillier) gets plopped down in the middle of campus and is immediately swept up in a montage of fraternal initiations and college ragers. Her black sheep of an older sister (Rumpf) stays at arm's length and her roommate Adrien (Oufella) isn't much of a help either. Thus she allows herself one too many indulgences and gets lost in a downward spiral that would put the goody-goody on your dorm room floor your freshman year to shame. Because we've all seen the exact same kind of thing before, not just in real life but in other films ad nausium, there's really no real tension as far as the story is concerned. We know where all this is going, the question is how far will it go.It goes about as far as you would expect, but does it all in a way that at times feels too literate and at other times too literal. In one scene our heroine is compelled to make out with a fellow freshman to the approval of their gracious ""elders"". ""Come out when you're both green,"" says one senior who had just doused them in blue and yellow paint and stuffed them into a dorm room bathroom. The color, the poppy music, the very situation, just screams art house overkill. It forces the audience to swim in a soup of hook-up excess masquerading as sex positive messaging, and gets us all to feel self-satisfied when we pick up on the films very clear themes.Other times the camera lingers on gaping wounds and savagely ripped tendons for the sake of primal shocks. By the time we actually get to those scenes however, half the audience is conked-out while the other half is frustrated by the lack of I Drink Your Blood (1970)-level lunacy. Raw only really finds its balance in one incredibly effective scene: a scene in which the characterizations, thickly laid thematic groundings and primal sensationalism all coalesce to bring new meaning to the phrase nail-biting.Raw is ultimately an interesting failed experiment in genre-crossing. It tries to take the gore-induced shocks of a very particular sub-genre of horror and attempts to elevate it via art house trappings and pseudo-feminist sensibilities. I admire the attempt, and I understand its zeal in the midst of successes like A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night (2014) and The Witch (2015). Yet as far as having its Chianti and drinking it too, I really think the farthest this sub-genre can stretch is Cannibal! The Musical (1993).",Raw
48,arungeorge13,Not your typical cannibal movie! [+66%],7,5 August 2017,"Several scenes from 'Raw' are bound to stay with the viewer for a long while, and that's not just owing to their repulsive nature. There is some brilliant, madcap writing and exquisite packaging on display. For a feature-length writing/directing debut, Julia Ducournau deserves a huge round of applause. While I'd say that the basic plot and characterization aren't as exceptional as they seem, the images are in-your-face horrendous and crafted with a grotesque sense of gratification. Solid work by Ruben Impens on the cinematography (there are some wildly disconcerting facades detailing the deepest, darkest cravings of the human mind that are bound to induce nightmares!). This is a cannibal film that does not adhere either to the 80s Italian cannibal-template or something more recent such as the Hannibal series. The writer / director delicately chisels the 'vegetarian' central character played by Garance Marillier as she goes through a ragging phase at her new (vet) school, that entails her to break her vows, resulting in a slow, yet massive addiction to meat, eventually transitioning into a cannibal of sorts. The universe (i.e. the vet school - its people and ambiance) in itself is one of constant disdain and gloom. The sophomores treat the rookies like their lab- rats..dousing them in blood, making them eat rabbit kidney, pestering them to engage in erotic activities at parties and so on, with little to no interference from the faculty (who are hardly seen).While practicality is given slightly lesser emphasis, director Julia stages certain scenes in such a manner that there's the obvious urge to look away (especially the waxing scene) although generating a sadistic yearning within the viewer to witness how it all unfurls. The (senior) sister character could have admittedly been handled better, especially after her revelation of the 'secret' that had been running within the family for ages now. Justine though, is a better written character and her metamorphosis into a consummate cannibal appears more credible.This isn't a film that simply resorts to mire itself in controversy by hurling random bizarre images on the viewer. Whatever you see unfold on screen is necessitated as a result of the multi-layered nature of the central character Justine. She explores her sexual awareness and her newfound primal traits one at a time and derives complacency through momentary pleasures. Julia's film draws body-horror inspiration from David Cronenberg's and Darren Aronofsky's works all the while managing to leave her own fresh imprint. Few things such as the insertion of scenes depicting gay sex and animal dismembering didn't really serve any purpose. But fear not, the film is deliciously packed at 99 minutes. Marillier's nerve-wracking stare into the camera when she guzzles blood from her own hand while climaxing to her roommate, is truly unforgettable!Verdict: A cannibal movie with distinctive traits!",Raw
49,Screen_Blitz,"Gory French-horror tale paints a smart subtle look at the ugly side of human nature, though it may prove to be too nauseating for some",8,27 October 2017,"This French-horror piece directed by Julia Ducournau has been hit with a substantial amount of buzz nationally and internationally. Whether from being praised for its ingenious quality or subject to notoriety for reportedly causing audiences to either leave the theaters early or rush to the restroom to blow chunks, this film is undoubtedly unique. The central theme is this horror tale is cannibalism, which is the tool to operate this gruesome coming-of- age where its revolting content is polished by sleek artistic style. Above its nauseating material is a commentary about discovering a hidden side of yourself and exploring the true you, a message that is greatly examined through the lens of a filmmaker who has a gift for telling a potent story without resorting entirely to gory exploitation. It's smart, it's subtle, and at times, shockingly funny. But one thing's sure, it is most certainly not for the faint of the heart. This film brings us Justine (played by Garance Marmillier), an 18-year old girl starting her freshman year at a veterinarian academy where she is introduced to a carnivorous hazing ritual in a form of a fraternity. Growing up as a vegetarian, Justine is forced to make the undesirable choice of eating a raw rabbit kidney by her older sister Alexa (played by Elena Rumpf) or risk being socially outcasted. Upon consuming the meat, Justine experiences bizarre changes to herself that lead her to growing an obsessive appetite for human flesh, an appetite that poses a danger to both herself and her fellow peers. As convincing as it may sound, this is not a zombie movie -- though it most certainly shares a few traits of one. And the title definitely fits the description for the events that transpires throughout the picture. Above the lurid violence and raw sexual material is something much more shrewd for those with a strong stomach to admire. Director Julia Ducournau orchestrates an ingenious character study of a girl who is a fish-out-of-water upon entering a college life that strays far beyond what she (or the audiences for the matter) would imagine, and the psychological journey she endures becomes the driving force of the story. The relationship between her and her sister grows into a crucial subplot, and thanks to the performances by Garance Marmillier and Elena Rumpf; they each bring a helping hand at making it strike at the heart. Marmillier plays her role with stunning, yet bizarre conviction that will engage some while alienate others, especially when she is busy munching on human meat. Rumpf's performance is hardly any difference. And while the story does stumble in a few spots with trying to figure out how to proceed, it magnificently exhibits care for its characters and offers a powerful artistic style with its surreal erotic tone. Ducournau demonstrates she is not afraid to push boundaries, and that only allows for an experience that is powerful, albeit deeply unsettling and uncomfortable even for the most desensitized audience. By the end, the only real qualm viewers are likely to walk away from is the inability to unsee some of the nauseating imagery that occurs. Raw is a surprisingly subtle horror tale with a unique vision at the absurd side of human nature and an uncompromising demonstration at pushing the boundaries with gross, yet effective shock value. For some, this movie will come off as a challenge, which is reasonable to think. Nonetheless, it is a film with a brain only the harden viewers will witness.",Raw
50,gedikreverdi,Impressive!,8,1 January 2021,"She started the vet faculty like her older sister and her parents. As a freshman she underwent awkward rituals done by the senior students. She was shy and smart. Her roommate was a gay freshman. After they ate raw rabbit kidney she developed a nasty rash all over her body and the doctor gave her a lotion which is the same lotion that her sister had in her cabin. It really Grossed me out the was she puked hair. And then her sister and she tried peeing standing and that was really hilarious. When her sister wanted to wax her, they had an altercation while her sister had a pair of scissors in her hand and her finger got cut off with her kick. While waiting for the paramedics she ate her sister's finger and she saw it too. When she got out of the hospital, her sister showed her how she provided herself fresh human meat by making people have accident. Then she wore her sister's sister and wore liptstick. After being covered in paint like a boy, they made out but she ate her lip too. It was really impressive her in the shower draining off the paint and eating lip meat from the floor of the shower. Then she and her gay roommate made out really rough and she lost her virginity and the next day they argued because she felt he's ignoring him but he got mad because he's gay and don't want girls to hang out. She got drunk and got really promiscuous at a party hitting on both couples boys and girls. Her sister took her to the morgue and her roommate showed her the video in the morning about her sister mocking her with a dead corpse's arm and she was at the floor drunk trying to reach out for the arm to eat it. She got mad and fought with her sister in the courtyard in front of other students by biting each other. She was bitten in the face and her sister dressed the wound. The next day she woke up with her roommate to a loud music from the outside but he wasn't waking up. Under the cover she saw his leg was eaten and her sister was there covered in blood. She washed her sister in the shower.

53,joebloggscity,Stomach churning tale of the pains of student cannibalism,8,12 June 2017,"The stories were out that this film led to the need for medical attention for various viewers at the initial viewings. Having watched this now, I think most of those stories are likely just hype, but it is quite a stomach churner, and that is made clear from the opening scene. As soon as Laurent Lucas appeared on screen, I remembered one of his previous films 'Alleluia' which was one heavy movie for anyone, and this follows in that vein.We have here a young vegetarian girl, Justine, who is joining her elder sister at vet school where the environment and students are like hell on earth. Justine gets introduced to eating meat, and things begin to spiral as she starts to grow up sexually and mentally (teenage pains), but not in a positive sense and a dark secret starts to seep out.This is a film that is shot in a dark arty style, and it's claustrophobic and unforgiving. However, compared to many other dark psychological movies, this film is more bearable. The lead actress in particular gives a wonderful performance, and the myriad of characters paint a gruesome but effective picture here.It's a tough movie, and I'd recommend that if you watch it then stick it out to the end. It does begin to make a lot of sense as you progress.

55,bryank-04844,'Raw' is hands down the BEST MOVIE!,10,23 January 2017,"'RAW' made me remember why I love movies. I can't wait for you all to feast your eyes and stomachs on first time French director Julia Ducournau's masterpiece in cinema, simply titled 'RAW'. Julia takes an overly done genre trope (cannibalism) and completely makes it fresh, organic, and ready to serve to the masses in a very beautiful, elegant, and most disturbing way in which a young woman is on a coming- of-age quest in her life and discovers her sexual side as well as a new appetite.This film hits on some real primal emotions that I did not think I had in me and had me completely hypnotized from start to finish in this well-paced magnificent movie. The film follows the smart and shy young woman Justine (Garance Marillier) as she enters her very first day of university where everyone is learning to become veterinarian. At her first party, she runs into her older sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf), who is also studying to be a veterinarian and who wants to both look after her younger sister and torment her.The older students certainly haze the incoming freshman, by making them do some grueling tasks, including throwing animal blood over all of them and making them eat raw animal organs. It's a difficult job for Justine to eat the animal organs, since she and her whole family have been vegan for all their lives, but in order to fit in, she is more or less forced to take that first taste of raw meat. Turns out, she loves it. Perhaps too much as she craves more and more of that raw meat.At the same time, Justine is undergoing her sexual awakening, whether it be with her gay male roommate or someone else in the school. The parallels of both her food and sexual appetite are done in the most subtle and gracious ways, and at no time do you ever dislike Justine or her sister Alexia. On the contrary, these characters are so well ""fleshed"" out that you want to be friends with them. As the film plays out, Ducournau (who also wrote the screenplay) keeps delivering surprises at every corner, keeping our minds racing, stomachs rumbling, and story flowing.The relationship between Alexia and Justine is simply fantastic. These two sisters are so real and one of the themes of the film is loyalty and family, which in no matter what obstacle comes your way, you stick together. Mariellier and Rumpf turn in exquisite performances and this being Ducournau's first film – I can't imagine how amazing her second foray into filmmaking will be. The practical effects of gore here are so realistic, that you might second guess yourself as to whether or not anyone was really harmed during the film. That's how good it is. 'RAW' is one of those films that comes around once every ten years and you shouldn't miss it.MUST-SEE!",Raw

60,PyroSikTh,A French Coming-of-Cannibal Movie,8,28 January 2018,"Yes, Raw is about a girl becoming a woman shrouded in the veil of cannibalism and body horror. The movie's quite a slow burn to begin, as we're introduced to Justine and her strictly vegetarian family as they drop her off at veterinary college. She's interrupted by college initiations that border on bullying (that the entire year suffers, and has suffered for decades as a college tradition). One such initiation is to eat a raw rabbit kidney, which is the first meat she's ever tasted, and it opens up an addiction to flesh she never knew she had. She starts by stealing a burger, then digs into raw chicken breasts, and ultimately finds herself desiring human meat. Thankfully, she also discovers her sister suffers the same addiction.If you go into this expecting a full-on cannibal movie, you'll be left disappointed. While there are a number of gory and difficult-to-watch scenes, there's nothing worth fainting over (like the festival hype would have you believe). In fact compared to many horror movies it's quite tame. Just about the worst is watching her wretch a load of hair she accidentally swallowed. Raw is more of a coming-of-age drama, a character study of Justine as she experiences new things and grows into her own woman outside of the influence of her parents. She discovers her body and it's desires, drawing comparisons between her craving for flesh and her newfound sexuality. She endures humiliation and embarrassment, and tries to find her place in the social workings of the college (and life), learning which urges to resist and which urges to give in to.It doesn't shy away from nudity, but never makes it the focus either. Glimpses of breasts and buttocks are never glamourised or sexualised, and even a close-up of Justine's crotch as she gets a wax is portrayed as just being a part of life and nothing to get riled up about. In fact when there are sexually-charged scenes, nudity is largely absent. They are separate elements of the film that never marry, which is something you'd never find in an American film, or really anywhere less sexually liberal than mainland Europe, giving the film an inherently French feel.The score by Jim Williams really sets the tone as well, opting for delicate strings and folky acoustic guitars, emphasising the more dramatic, arty moments more than the horrific. That said there's one track in particular that's cued up so perfectly that it almost single-handedly defines a pivotal moment in the film. Justine's first taste of human flesh is with a recently severed finger, and it starts with curiosity and exploration, testing the limits of her desires, and the music is typically coming-of-age, but at the exact moment she puts the finger in her mouth to suck the blood, the music suddenly changes to the main theme of crescendo organs and fuzzy bass. Like damn, she tested the boundaries and that was it crossed right there. The act, the reaction on her face like she's tasted a forbidden fruit, and the sudden shift in music at that exact moment marks it as the moment everything changes for her. It's palpable, and so expertly crafted. It has instantly gone down as one of my favourite single moments in movies.So I enjoyed Raw. I think if I had expected a straight-up cannibal movie, I still wouldn't have been disappointed as instead what I got was something with a bit more substance and emotion than a cannibal movie might otherwise offer.

I didn't like/understand the weird hazing at the veterinary school, and I wish there was an explanation of why the things that happened, happened. And I don't think that I could ever re-watch this.

64,rdoyle29,A brilliant horror debut,9,2 October 2017,"Garance Marillier stars as Justine, a young vegetarian from a family of strict vegetarians who is just starting at a veterinarian college. All of her family are vets, and all attended the same college ... in fact her older sister (Ella Rumpf) is already attending it. As part of the school's rather extreme hazing rituals, she is forced to eat a raw rabbit kidney. This sets her off down a rather gory and extreme journey of self-discovery and sexual awakening. This is an extraordinary debut film. While the film certainly doesn't shy from the gory details, it's not a gore film really. It's a body horror film in the tradition of David Cronenberg and it operates through a mix of focusing on the mundane things that really get to you (being unable to stop scratching, getting cut, biting) and on a constant slightly unsettling atmosphere. It manages to really be about everything that scary about becoming an adult without losing it's laser focus on the central metaphor. All of this is aided by a really strong performance from Marillier.",Raw
65,dcarsonhagy,An All Vegetarian Meat Dish...,5,26 May 2017,"""Raw"" is a movie from French director Julia Ducourcnau. It turns what should be an easy-to-follow movie into a non-sensible, muddled, and very confusing tale.The main character, Justine, is on her way to Vet School somewhere in France. She will follow in the footsteps of her father, her mother, and her eldest sister, who also is attending the same school. I will have to say, French schools are way different then schools in America. When Justine and her parents arrive at the school, she is immediately abandoned and left to her own devices. As a freshman, she must endure the rite of passage, i.e. hazing, from her elder classmen. In a half-days times, she is thrown into what seems to be a decadent, albeit more sophisticated Sodom and Gomorrah, where free sex, free drugs, and just about any vice you can image exists. The following day, she has to endure further hazing and it is demanded of her that she eat a raw rabbit kidney. Please bear in mind she (and the rest of her family) are vegetarians. That is when the train goes off the track.I don't want to give away any of the plot, but I will say I was very confused about the relationship between Justine and her sister. Also, given all the crap surrounding Justine, not a single question was ever asked, beginning with why she allowed a gay guy to take her virginity to how she could walk blood-soaked across a full campus and no student ever notice. I understand this movie has gotten rave reviews just about everywhere. A screening at a Toronto Movie Festival supposedly had people fainting and vomiting. All I can say to that is ""don't believe the hype.""Rated ""R"" (and in French with subtitles) for bloody violence, disturbing images, brief nudity, and language. Another toss-up for me.",Raw
66,jimmycoffin-751-212853,Playing it safe and boring,3,15 October 2017,"I don't care for cred-ability, and I don't need explanations to why she developed taste for blood, or why there's no teachers nowhere to be found while teens crawling around bleeding and snorting at rave party's. That cannibalism run in the family? Or some other subtext stuff you notice throughout.for this type of wannabe-different film it needs a lot more to grab my attention then some Girls bickering, and to get all the more intimate things we humans do, waxing, BJ, jerking off, pissing or whatnot. I noticed all the high rollin Reviews here so I thought I even it out. For me this is just Another typical french, (how can we compete with inside and martyrs.) kind of Movie. I myself found it boring. It's fictional World works like battle royale or a bad version of Caspar Noe's into the void. which ever could just pulled outta 12 Gage and killed somebody and no one would blink. I love decadent and artsy slow burn Movies, but this isn't one of them. So in the end you don't care for none of the characters in raw, because its build around a craving for flesh that runs in the family but it doesn't lead anywhere except they go to the same school as they parents did.. But yeah.. I hated martyrs too.. A anorectic girl trying to scare.. Doesn't matter how high the gross volume is. I find it utter garbage without that final piece of the puzzle. The Music here also didn't click for me. RAW Is not all bad., I would have liked it more but It's to self-aware. Take the scene when her sister laps the cheek, it plays very sad and dramatic Music in the background, Like it is supposed we should care about the cannibalistic girl finding her inner self facing her demons just to in the end keep on finding a new school? education? what's next?

It seems there is a female blood lust going on in movie land just now and the two would sit as excellent companion pieces, although there are fewer laughs in this.If blood puts you off give this a wide berth. If genuine but well developed anti establishment hokum (it is horror hokum at then of the day) is your thing you will love this.Think early Cronenburg,Think early Alice Lowe.

69,eagandersongil,The desire for the flesh generates multiple interpretations,8,15 May 2018,"""Grave"" The French film that talks about discovery and sexuality with a metaphorically visceral approach, the desire and discovery by the flesh in ""Grave"" is literal. The film tells the story of a young vegetarian who after going through a college trot begins to have desires for meat, preferably human. The script at first glance has a simple look, but it has many layers and different interpretations, some will see a zombie movie in a reduced spectrum, others will see a horror film about cannibals, others a teen vampire film, no interpretation is 100 Wrong%, but ""Grave"" is not a genre film, it turns more to a drama about youth and discovery, I may not like the way the film goes from the third act, more is indisputable that his argument is great . With an extremely bluish photograph, and a camera in hand, technically, ""Grave"" is good, if it uses the subjective camera, does not exaggerate in Gore, it is a heavy film but without being forced, its violence is completely organic, its rhythm can weigh a little, but it is compensated by the magnificent performances of Garace Marillier and Ella Rumpf, who indulge and live their characters intensely, besides a good soundtrack, which combines and gives a special charm to the film. We can say that the first film of the promising French director Julia Ducournau is a horror movie, a zombie film, a film about the heinousness of heredity, about family, about sexual discovery, it is a film of multiple interpretations that passes away from perfection but grabs merit of being a great movie.",Raw
70,TheHoodOfSwords,Weird But Very Entertaining,8,26 May 2020,"Still conflicted on this one between a 7 and an 8. French cinema does this thing where the best way I can describe it is that it's ""ugly"" and ""gross"" and I want to be clear I don't mean gross in the fact of shock imagery or lots of gore. I mean in all the French movies I've seen the characters usually wear little to no makeup and they show them in their actual lives. Eating food messily, wearing little to no clothes and letting shots linger for longer then you'd think. That being said this movie does not fall short of its fair share of gore and gross imagery. There is a literal scene where Justine pulls 4 feet of hair out of her throat. I'm not kidding. And, you know it's a zombie film.In terms of acting I think it's hard for me to judge it when it's in another language. It seemed fine, but as I say I'm not sure how to properly judge acting in another language. All the actors seemed to do a good job though and there are definitely a few big freak out emotional moments in this film that I liked.Finally, I want to say I like how this movie leaves some stuff open. It doesn't hold your hand the whole way through and it allows you to come to your own conclusions. Without spoiling it the reason I bumped this up to a 8/10 is in the last 15 minutes of the film. This movie is also a coming of age film. It's a bit weird to think of it in that way but it honestly is. It's about Justine, a girl going to vet school who feels like she's on the outside looking in. If you're into a body horror/ zombie flick done differently but done quite well I'd check this one out. I actually started watching this back in 2016 but I was too young and got 10 minutes in before realizing it was in French and turning it off but it was definitely worth it to come back to and watch.Also I don't wanna go to any education facility ever after seeing the initiation these guys have to go through.",Raw

This one falls in 2nd category. The two main actresses plus the gay roommate were really convincing in their roles. And must say that it is a clever 'move' to study in the school where you have a lot of meat :) but their parents knew what they were doing when sending their daughters to that school.I guess the final scene makes sense for the previous vegetarian - now you understand why they are and have to be veggies :)All in all, interesting 90 minutes.

73,trublu215,Another Over-hyped Horror Film...,4,7 March 2017,"Raw is the latest horror film that has become the target of (almost) universal acclaim. The question remains as to why, considering the fact that Raw is just a schlock fest attempt at shock value that grossly (both literally and figuratively) underwhelms. The film chronicles a teenage vegetarian who attends a boarding school for the veterinary arts and is then subjected to a grisly accident that costs her her finger...and her sanity. As the film progresses, it becomes more and more apparent that this young girl is developing an sensational lust for sex and human flesh directly borough on by her unfortunate mishap.The film falls into the category of attempted shock and fails to really shock you. It parades an abundance of sex and gore on screen but none of it holds any weight. The violence and gore that ensues becomes a rote exercise in the type of horror that this past decade has been known for: a big build up to a no nothing pay off. It is about as frustrating as it could get when it comes to satisfying. Much in the vein of Salo: 120 Days of Sodom and last year's The Neon Demon, Raw delivers very lightly and makes promises it can't deliver. The screenplay is boring and under written and features a couple memorable moments surrounded by a whole lot of blood drenched fluff that is brought out by some gorgeous cinematography.. It is woefully unsatisfying even to the most hardcore of horror fans.Overall, Raw is yet another horror movie that feels a little more hyped up than it ought to be. Instead of living up to it's potential, the film falters under the pressure which is frustrating considering this is a very original idea. Overall, I felt let down by Raw and I really wanted it to live up to the hype that it brought on when it was making festival runs. Instead, we get a film that feels half baked even if the presentation of it looks very nice.",Raw

75,darkreignn,"""Raw?"" More like one of the best movies I've seen!",9,18 January 2018,"""Raw"" is a French film that is littered with small details that you'll pick up on but won't know the true meaning of until the credits roll.Marketed as a horror film about a young, attractive female cannibal, ""Raw"" is instead a slow burn art-house drama about a college student who is trying to find herself amidst a turbulent hazing week at college, sexual exploration, and a craving for meat in all its forms. Because of this, it is obvious the general audience will hate this film. Some audience members have found this movie to be very slow moving, claiming that it goes on and on and on and ends up nowhere, but I would disagree. The pace builds gradually, instilling a steady sense of menace and unease within the viewer, and the film explores many topics that are indeed relatable to many, including, as mentioned previously, sexual exploration and new, forbidden, taboo urges. But because of the fact that this film has been marketed as a horror film, I believe that many people are losing the point; yes, this movie deals with topics that are horrifying, but ""Raw"" deals with topics that everyone can relate to - it just amplifies them to an extreme degree. For example, everyone deals with repressed or forbidden sexual urges, such as the urge to consume pornography. For some, their urge controls them to a point where they will seek out pornography in many different forms. Is the urge for pornography any different than the urge to eat meat? Or, perhaps a better example may be the urge for human connection. Human connection is something that everyone craves, and without it one can become severely damaged. Is the urge for human connection any different than the urge to consume flesh? ""Raw"" uses this woman's craving for meat as a metaphor that can be applied to literally any craving that a human could possibly have. Yes, it's disturbing to watch someone be consumed by their desire, but yet everyday people are consumed by other desires that are not as graphic, so to speak, but we don't pay attention to it because it isn't disgusting or highly immoral, or at least as immoral as cannibalism. And I think at its core, ""Raw"" is trying to bring to our attention how easy it is to succumb to our unethical desires if they are remained unchecked, whether that desire be smoking, drinking, gambling, porn binging, or cannibalism.But anyway, let's get back to talking about the movie itself. The soundtrack! God, it's euphoric, coming in a just the right moments to give your eardrums sensuous pleasure like no other, and pulling back at just the right moments so you crave for more. I don't really know how to convey what it sounds like into words, but if you watch a trailer for the film you'll get a slight taste of what's in store, in terms of the soundtrack. The directing is also very well done. Maybe I'm just a sucker for films that contain neon colors, good music, and slow motion, because this film contains it all and I loved every second of this movie, but I'll go into more detail about why exactly the directing and acting is so brilliant.When you hear of a film called ""Raw"" that is about a cannibal, you expect it to be some sort of overly violent, disgusting movie a la ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""The Green Inferno."" ""Raw,"" however, is neither overly violent nor that disgusting (there is only one scene where I found myself feeling mildly sickened, but it was more because of what was about to happen rather than what was actually being shown on the screen). Director Julia Ducournau decided to stay very subdued in terms of gore, and it works. Whether we like to admit it or not, people like watching violence, and horror films are a testament to that; films like ""Hostel"" and ""Saw"" show people drenched in depravity, suffering like no human being should have to suffer, and people enjoy watching them suffer. Julia Ducournau pulls back and decides to not show all of the violence that one would expect in a movie about a young cannibal. In fact, there is not even that much violence in this movie at all. Sure, you'll get to see some cannibalism, and you'll even get to see some animalistic sex, but the restraint that is shown is truly what makes ""Raw"" as good as it is. Maybe you've heard that people were asked if they wanted a barf bag as they bought a ticket to this movie? That is sensationalism at its finest. The movie is gross, but it is not nearly as bad as other movies about cannibalism that I have seen (like ""The Green Inferno""); the restraint that is shown sets this movie apart from other mainstream horror films that have been released recently. If you're looking for shock value, this isn't the movie for you.The acting is also handled with tact and restraint (I just love using that word). Garance Marillier plays everyone's favorite young cannibal, and she conveys so much through her mannerisms and facial expressions, and through her eyes. You can really see just how hungry this woman is but yet how much she is trying to keep her cravings on a tight leash. One taste of meat sets her on a collision course of sex and alcohol, and it is so interesting to watch her try to live that side of her while also keeping in touch with her humanity and empathy. And an urge to consume human flesh is not the only thing that she has to deal with. On top of that, she has to deal with her own sexual urges, with school hazing and all of the humiliation that comes along with it, with her sister and all of the problems she brings along, with her roommate and the sexual tension that exists between them, with college courses, with her parents, and more.""Raw"" is not just a movie about a cannibal; it's a movie about a young girl who is still growing up and trying to figure out what kind of person she is while dealing with a sensory overload the likes of which she's never before experienced. Dramatic, sweet, sexy, and challenging: ""Raw"" is a film that you may not necessarily want to see, but nevertheless should watch because of how well it conveys the college experience through the eyes of a young, attractive, female cannibal. ""Raw"" explains to us that we all have dark urges; some of them just happen to be darker than others.",Raw

77,asifahsankhan,The Beauty of Cannibalism?,8,1 May 2017,"Raw, the debut feature film of French director Julia Ducournau, is both a cannibal horror movie and a coming-of-age movie, one in which the sexual awakening of its young protagonist Justine (Garance Marillier) sits alongside the birth of a more destructive, if similarly all-consuming kind of hunger.The film opens as the teenager, brought up in a vegetarian family, heads off to college for the first time. Her destination – a veterinary school, Alma-mater of both her parents and the current home of her older sister Alexa (Ella Rumpf), a senior student – is a Frankenstein's laboratory of horrors: think floating, detached organs and drugged farm animals, hoisted aloft while in restless slumber.Crucially, though, the film never suggests that Justine's flesh- eating antics are a direct result of her burgeoning sexuality. Nor does it present her cannibalism as a clumsy metaphor for her other ""carnal"" desires. Instead, its power – its shuddering, relentless intensity – lies in the way it makes you vicariously feel both her dual hungers, and surreptitiously relish every sticky, illicit bite. Bodies, in this film, are never far away: there's always just a little too much skin on screen. But, alongside the slow eroticism, Ducournau also shows a keen sense of just how warped our relationships with our own physical selves have become.Tellingly, the first scene of intense cannibalism comes after a graphic bikini-waxing scene that'll make you wince. Biting into another human being is a big no no, yet this sort of eye-watering beauty ritual is ostensibly ""normal"". Is it any wonder, the film cleverly implies, that we, her captive audience – a little confused?",Raw

I would look at the lights in the room or the people around me, just so I wouldn't have to look at the screen during some parts. It is clear from the start that the objective of the director is to make the audience uncomfortable, and I applaud his effectiveness in doing so. I was most impressed by the ability of Raw to leave me genuinely cringing at nearly every single scene. It didn't even have to be gore filled or disgusting in a traditional sense. The whole film oozes an uneasiness that the seeps into the audience. As much as I admire the clear objective of the filmmakers and how well they achieved it, it is not the movie for me.

What's not to enjoy about a allegorical coming of age cannibalism tale?The film tells the story of a veterinarian student who discovers she's a cannibal! The movie has a slow burn pace that is meant to build momentum at a snail's pace. The movie does do a good job of building suspense though. The entire film you were on the edge of your seat waiting for the big payoff.The pacing by itself was not an issue but the reward for your patience was not as grandiose and gory as expected. While of course a movie about cannibalism is going to shows violence, I was expecting Martyr or High tension level gore. The movie was very well shot and directed.

80,Otkon,Less of a horror movie...,7,27 July 2021,"...and more of a tale of sibling rivalry, the stressful demands of higher education and the dangers of repressing basic human needs, notably via an ascetic plant-based diet.She may not appear it when we first meet her Justine is a festering ball of pent-up emotions and desires - the nerdy super-achiever with the over-protective parents. And she is off to the veterinary school of her dreams where her big sister Alex is already a student. Expectations are high for wunderkind Justine with the faculty and fellow co-eds, and immediately she finds herself under both authoritative and peer pressure to appease both groups.As is usual with young adults branching out from the parents' nest, Justine experiments while at college under the influence of now-found liberty and the insistence of others. And does that ever go wrong. It starts with a small taste of uncooked rabbit sweetbread during an innocuous welcoming event for freshmen. She soon learns that the vegetarian regime - of which she was an unwilling member - has stunted her fun factor. With freedom on her side, she begins indulging in the wild - albeit uniquely European - aspects of campus life: all night raves, carousing with sexually-ambiguous abandon, stealing food from the commissary and sporadic fits of uncontrollable bloodlust/flesh consumption.She has finally obtained her long-denied joie de vivre.Of course her sister and her gay male flatmate complicate things with their wanting to have unsevered fingers and only relationships with other men, respectively. But in the end, she sure shows them, charging up her sibling's competitive nature and eventually inducing Alex to murder and eat her cohabitant so she can have the dorm room all to herself next semester. Her plan works brilliantly.Oh and their dad eventually reveals that the cannibalism thing is something that runs in the distaff line of their family.I posit that the theme of the film is absolutely not that ""meat bad; veggie good"" but the more universal concept that the denial and inevitable discovery of anything pleasurable will lead to a compulsion for it - although presented in a hyperbolically cinematic way. Moderation in all things; humans physiologically have evolved to eat and digest animal flesh. And just as overconsumption of botanical foodstuffs can lead to intestinal bloating, increased toxicity exposure, metabolic diseases and vegetable rage, meat should be consumed just as responsibly.Justine's story is indeed a cautionary one.",Raw
81,ctowyi,A potent cannibal awakening story,8,18 March 2017,"We have all seen the umpteen coming-of-age or sexual awakening story, but when is the last time you saw a becoming-a-cannibal story? This is one incredibly muscular piece of filmmaking, marrying visual poetry with slow-burn horror into one potent and delectable dish. Debut writer-director Julia Ducournau knows exactly what she wanted to do and did it, and the resultant film is a different breed of horror with no cheap jump scares and with the camera never flinching from all body and animal horror. During a screening at the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, some viewers received emergency medical services after allegedly fainting from the film's graphic scenes. IMHO, this notoriety does it a huge disservice. Perhaps the viewers went into the cinema with an empty stomach or have a weak disposition for copious blood and body horror because Raw is never tacky or cheesy in its depiction of its terror. Ducournau knows the medium well and employs a plethora of aesthetics to drive the terror home. The cinematography is fluid and complicit in the sinister going-ons; it somehow manages to glide seamlessly to places we don't want to go (under the bed covers, in a toilet where blue and yellow collide) and see stuff that we don't want to see (rashes on young flesh). I am never ever going to forget a scene in which a poor horse get tranquillised, a mouth restraint slapped on it, gets tied up and turned upside down in a harness. It was spine-chilling and my mind kept whispering prayers that it will be fine. The takes are long and languid, but purposeful and place us in the thick of things. It felt like I was given full access to an accident site and I was led to study in closed-up the twisted metal and the mangled bodies. I couldn't look away even though I wanted to. The shots are superbly lighted, disconcerting and symbolically rich. Ogle in amazement as the camera follows Justine in the first night of hazing to a make-shift discotheque that resembles hell itself. IMHO the genius of this lean and mean film is that it manages to make us feel for Justine. We feel the revolting disgust churning inside her as she, a lifelong virginal vegetarian, is forced to swallow a raw offal from a rabbit. The angry crimnson rash that flares up all over her is a manifestation of her disgust, but soon it awakens her cannibalistic core. In Garance Marillier, Ducournau has found the perfect Justine. Her transformation arc is magnificent and her multi-layered performance is career-defining. I still cannot forget the scene of her jiving sexily in front of the mirror, becoming aware of herself sexually. She exudes an animalistic energy so thick and heavy, she fused the scenes together in absolute dread. Her eventual deflowering scene, coupled with the birth of her cannibalistic leanings, is presented in total nerve-wrecking literalness. Raw isn't for everybody. I wouldn't even say a horror fan will like it. It has an art-house feel to it that may turn some people away. But it is a bold film, sublimely realised, erotic, feral, primal and it will play on your senses long after it is over.",Raw

I didn't like it, but it definitely holds your attention for better or worse and some seem to love it, but if it has a point, I don't know what it is. If it's just a horror film about cannibalism, then I guess it works a bit as it is gross now & then and does contain one scene midway that made me look away, something I didn't think possible anymore. It seems to think it has a big reveal at the end that didn't reveal anything shocking to me. The two female leads and the roommate are all good performers and he's hot in a confusing role, but it's not entertaining other than having a car wreck kinda fascination, I guess, but I always turn my head away from those as well.

Everything just culminates into one of the most effective genre films in years.That being said, while some parts of this movie are difficult to stomach, I wish it could have gone a step further. The movie doesn't truly explore Cannibalism as a spectator sport, and I wish it would have gone to 11 with the blood & gore.

84,WubsTheFadger,Raw,8,7 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, Julia Ducournau has created a darkly disturbing yet intelligently messaged film. The film deals with a lot of themes and tones. From family love and family sins are two of the main themes throughout the film. The film delivers its story fluently and makes us connect with the main protagonist easily. The Cannibalism aspect of the film is symbolic and should be analyzed deeply (I am not going to explain its meaning because I don't want to ruin the film). The plot is gruesome, funny at times, and the ending is haunting.The acting is very good. Garance Marililer delivers a stunning performance as a shy, rule following girl with an unknown craving that she doesn't know she even has. Ella Rumpf, Rabah Nait Oufells, Laurent Lucas, and Joana Preiss also perform well.The pacing is very slow in the beginning but picks up towards the middle part of the film. The runtime is short running at about an hour and forty-five minutes. The tone of the film changes as the film progresses and becomes darker and more disturbing as the film continues onward.The use of violence in this film is perfect. Some people might find it overbearing, but I found it to be well blended into the story.Julia Ducournau directed the movie, wrote the dialogue, and wrote the screenplay. She has truly created a massive movie on her won and deserves all the credit.Pros: Dark and disturbing story, connecting with the protagonist, great use of symbolism, stunning ending, amazing performance by Garance Marillier, short runtime, great acting all around, changing tone, good use of violence, and Julia Ducournau and her amazing workCons: Some slow pacing and sometimes the movie was too disturbingOverall Rating: 8.3",Raw
85,Breumaster,"Close to a Good Idea, but Just a Mediocre Carying out With a Bad Explanation of Itself",6,17 March 2020,"I did like how the movie started. It was pretty tense for about half an hour, but after some rites, we all asked ourselves which university would be like that? Where are the teachers, why is there clearly no lesson? An university of just throwing parties. One of the main problems is, that the story of the main characters seems so unrealistic that we could only laugh about that movie. At some points it got some suspense, but the rest is just ugly gore. I think if they would have put some more thinking how to show and clever explain what happens to the characters, it would have been a better movie. 'Grave' does look a little bit like vegans made it to shock meatlovers. That's ok, but they should think of a better story next time. I recommend it for vegans. It must be the horrifically for them.",Raw
86,richardwworkman,Brutal bloody realism,8,25 January 2021,"There are very few films that I have watched that have caused such me to have such a physical reaction.The brutality of the horror is vivid and so realistic that it's difficult not to be physically disgusted by it.It seems odd to me that so many people actively seek out horror and when they see it presented in such a graphic way as this, it repulses them.However, at the heart of this movie is a solid story. The trite Hollywood idea of sexual awakening and self realisation is stripped down to animalistic lust and ravenous hunger.There are sublime moments of humour and amongst the blood and gore a touching story of sisterly love.Of course there's more to this move that just cannibalism. There are references to broader social brutality, the line between the accepted norms of social accessibility are deliberately blurred. The alcohol and induction parties are bizarre and the 70s architectural backdrop reminded me of A Clockwork Orange.This is true horror. You definitely won't forget seeing it although I suggest you watch it on an empty stomach.",Raw
87,deastman_uk,More Belgian veterinary violence,5,12 April 2017,"If you've seen Bullhead, then you know to expect some cattle mutilation and more in a Belgian film.This does not disappoint, with the vets college backdrop hosting lots of human and animal flesh for a potential alternative diet to get started.The film moves towards visceral, not so much weird or humorous (Get Out) with a family connection that doesn't quite cement the film but does act to explain some of the narrative.",Raw
88,quinimdb,Raw,7,16 June 2017,"For many, college is a time of self- discovery. It's really the first time away from parents, allowing for much more freedom and individuality for many. ""Raw"" answers what would happen if your new found independence led to the discovery that you loved the taste of human flesh.Justine, a shy and smart girl who has been raised a vegetarian, stood outside vet school expecting her sister to come meet her. Her real introduction to her sister is hours later, after she's been woken up in the middle of the night along with every other freshmen and led to a packed, pulsating party, showcased in one long take. In fact, she sees her sister's shaking ass before she even sees her face. After this overwhelming introduction to the college, her rush week begins. Here she is forced to eat a rabbit's kidney as part of the hazing, and, despite getting an awful rash as a result, her craving for meat begins to spiral out of control from here. This may seem like a huge transformation for such an introverted character to undergo, but Garance Marillier is surprisingly realistic in her performance, showing all of the guilt and disgust and discomfort that arises from this sudden awakening.What Justine's cannibalistic fetish results in, however, is not a schlocky horror movie in which she begins to hunt down college kids and eat them, but a movie about the pressure to fit in while also feeling the need to be herself. It's about Justine's rivalry with her sister, despite being the only person that truly understands her, and vice versa. It's about how her first time not being monitored or sheltered by her parents drives her to go wild. It's about addiction and its consequences. It's a weird movie by its nature, and a lot of its weirdness serves the symbolism of the story, but towards the end the shock value and strangeness go so over the top to the point of being inadvertently comedic, such as the strange gathering of people on the roof with that song playing in the background, and the fight between the sisters on that roof. However, the rich color palette, graphic and striking imagery, and the intense electronic soundtrack all contribute to a dreamlike atmosphere filled with unexpected symbolism, from the first eerie, empty, ultimately shocking wide shots to the final disturbing revelation.",Raw
89,schroederagustavo,"A beautiful coming of age story, feat. Cannibalism!",10,1 July 2019,"So, I had been wanting to see this film for a while now, I want to say for more than three years. I remember watching the trailer for this after it was shown at the Toronto Film Festival back in 2016. I thought the premise of the movie looked interesting enough, but then I started hearing all of these things regarding the showing of the movie during the actual festival, where (allegedly) someone or some people had passed out, thrown up and all of these crazy things. So, naturally, I really wanted to see the film to confirm if it had lived up to those expectations. And in that way, and fortunately only in that way, did this film disappoint me.Raw is a french coming of age film of this girl called Justine, who after her entire life of being overly protected by her parents, is sent off to college, more specifically to veterinary school where she learns to embrace her sexuality and find out who she really is, and it also turns out she likes to eat people. It's a cannibal film. And there are pretty violent and disturbing scenes, but they are sparse and I thought they were executed very well, but I mean it's really not that hardcore, by the standards that I was expecting. For some reason I was expecting like a gore-fest and there are elements of gore and horror in the movie, but at its core it's a drama.After watching the film I really started to think about what it was exactly that made me like this movie so much. Just to get this out of the way really quick, the direction and camera movement are both very interesting, the cinematography is great and never to show-offy, the performances are really good and the girl who plays the lead, who is called Garance Marillier is really great, one of the strongest female leads I have seen in a while. But there's something more to it, that on a weird level made me identify with what was going on on-screen. I didn't find out that I liked eating people or anything like that, but I think the story at its core level is relatable because, I've seen this story happen in real life quite a few times. Just to clarify, I don't know any cannibals, but that's not what I mean. I've known people who've grown up with overprotective parents and they really struggle to make their own decisions while they're growing up. I've known people who never went out to parties or went to really religious schools when they were younger, and all of the sudden when they get to college, they don't know how to handle all of the temptations: The partying, the drugs, sex, all of these things that most people already know how to handle at least on a basic level are just thrown at them all at once, and it can be overwhelming and I've seen people break, just like that because they don't know how to handle it. In this case, Justine, really can't handle all that I just mentioned, but it's taken to the extreme, where she has never eaten meat in her entire life and when she does try a little bit, it just awakens this thing inside her and on that level I think that's why it's very relatable. I loved this movie.",Raw
90,InaneSwine,Displays human desire for exactly what it is,7,3 December 2017,"The best horror films are dramas. This much has always been true. With Raw, the family drama of the difficult relationship between the protagonist and her sibling serves not as a backdrop to the gore. Rather, it transcends and enhances the grotesque imagery. Well acted from all sides and written with surprising sensitivity and thought, it poses some seriously dark questions about pleasure, basic human need and sexuality, and the rather thin line between them all.Having said all that, the graphic display of blood, guts and deformed flesh are easily the most memorable of all. They have the ability to simultaneously turn the stomach, admire the talent of the actors and also to commend the production design, make-up and cinematography.Raw is an intensely disturbing film that decides not to judge the weird and often psychotic characters, but to display human desire for exactly what it is, in the nastiest way possible.",Raw
91,Harhaluulo54,Lame soft-core fetish wish fulfillment,3,29 May 2017,"Paints, biting and picking out pubes. Insert some of the most annoying panting sounds produced by mankind and give it a shake. Not too good shake, there needs to be some lumps and bumps, serve the product and call it a movie. This time its name was ""Raw"" in English and ""Grave"" in French. Grave because it dug itself a big one and Raw because it is not even a finished product. As we can agree, it needed two different titles. The R18 and mature audience logos are there only for the nudity and ""erotic"" content that maybe turns on a painter, but not many more. This so called horror doesn't exists. It is like The Shining for that matter except even The Shining did a better job as a horror than this one. I guess some critics liked this one because it is just the right amount of tedious and pseudo-artistic to please a person who hates themselves for watching all the blockbuster movies just to call them the same old sh#t and get a minimal pay check, but also contains nothing deep and complex so they can still understand the movie and call it symbolic, smart and claim that everyone who didn't like it didn't get it. Despite there being nothing to get. I'd recommend watching this if a) you're looking for a new fetishes and tend to like slimy, or b) if you want to be a generic critic with bad taste and like something hipsters might like, or c) you want to hear the beast OST this has and witness the worst panting sound from any movie ever + hear 2 car horn honk 2 minutes straight and realize it is nowhere near the most annoying thing in this.",Raw
92,thelastblogontheleft,Slow Burn,8,24 October 2017,"Raw (original title: Grave) is French director Julia Ducournau's feature film debut, and DAMN it is good to see a female director rock so hard. It has won several awards at various screenings so far, which comes as no surprise to me. It is just barely over the line into the horror genre, but the scenes and images that do qualify have a lasting impact.The movie focuses primarily on Justine (Garance Marillier in what is her own feature film debut, amazingly) as she navigates the rather terrifying waters of starting veterinary school at her parents' alma mater and alongside her free-willed sister, Alexia (Ella Rumpf). During an unusually sinister hazing ritual, Justine — a lifelong vegetarian — is forced to eat raw meat, and finds she likes it more than she expected** SPOILERS! **What struck me initially — and throughout the entire film — was how different of a mood there was surrounding Justine's starting at school. There is usually such an air of excitement, nervous anticipation, and downright electricity when movie characters are shown going off to school but there is immediately a feeling of dread and sort of half-hearted resistance. There's no doubt that while Justine is obviously intelligent and compassionate, veterinary school — or at least *this* veterinary school — was not her first choice. The ""elders"" are cruelly juvenile in their displays of asserting their dominance and it makes for an unpredictable and volatile experience, not knowing when they will have another unreasonable request.The cinematography — done by Ruben Impens — is impressive from the get-go. The shots are fresh and creative, unapologetically both raw and genuine, stripped down at times but rich in symbolism, color placement/contrast, and excellent lighting.Speaking of symbolism, Ducournau does a masterful job at conveying Justine's sexual and self-awakening with the use of some primal yet honest imagery. She spends the first chunk of the movie cautiously bumbling through life, avoiding confrontation, dodging attention, and being afraid to stand up for her own personal values even as they're violated at the urging of her own sister. But after she tastes her first bit of raw flesh, she is slowly but intensely transformed. The scene of her covertly gnawing on a raw chicken breast from her room's mini fridge won't stick with me nearly as long as her rhythmically swaying and girating in front of the mirror, seemingly aware of her own power for the first time, sneering and smearing hot pink lipstick across her mouth.The gore is stomach-churning but well-placed. The film maintains this eerie hypnotism throughout — reminiscent, in a way, of David Lynch's work. There are many moments where your gut instinct is to turn your head but something deeper pulls at your attention.It crescendos into several fantastic twists at the end, which I won't ruin but suffice it to say that I loved the combination of repulsion and reuniting, the brutal and unhindered show of humanity's — and woman's — transformation.A grisly, heartbreaking, slow burn of a film highly recommended.",Raw
93,angiris,Tries too hard in an already crowded and decadent genre.,3,25 May 2017,"I can appreciate the horror theme of cannibalism, although I religiously hold Hannibal Lecter as the only cannibal movie done right because it choose not to just focus on the shock and horror of gore but also include a psychological nature that wasn't encrypted, symbolic or metaphorically executed. It was in the open and allowed for an actually intriguing story to unfold as we got a mix of horror, gore, drama, romance and psychology all in one. The problem most movies make nowadays alike Sci Fi copying Star Wars is that they don't understand how to make a movie alike the original. Instead they copy the themes and reckon the horror tropes, blood, and value of visuals will be sufficient. I feel that Raw commits the same mistake. It tries so hard to magnify the suppressed desires of our lead character with various color palettes, hardcore music, overdone theatrics. And it basically turns into a complete horror show without the horror. Instead with dead corpses, blood, murder and outrageous actions that have no rhyme or reason other than to shock you and give you the impression of chaos, death, reveling in destruction and devouring of flesh. THe issue with this is that the characters are poorly designed and their progress is forced and lackluster. For instance. The lead characters sister by accident loses her finger. She faints by watching this event. Yet about 30 minutes later in the movie its revealed that shes a cannibal who has embraced her desires and she has no problem looking at blood, nor even biting people. One moment we think the lead character is unique and has gory pleasures, the next we discover that the entire freaking school is packed with freak shows. And that's another thing that bothers me with thing. THe entire school is packed with your typical overblown frat groups. Messing up peoples bedrooms, tossing paint at people, embracing hedonism to insane extent. THe teachers don't care at all. Barely present. And basically. Its anarchy. Yet hilariously the frat boys talk about freedom !!! yet 5 minutes later they force people to call them specific names per hierarchy, and enforce dress codes. What the f. Freedom ... yeah right.All in all, this movie annoyed me. Its packed with stereotypes, overblown frat dudes that just force you to be free by conforming to brainless mentality. And the biggest crime of this movie calling itself a horror is... that most of the really bad scenes actually occur WHEN OUR LEAD CHARACTER IS Subconscious. Meaning the evil and loss of control is not something we directly see happening. Only the aftermath. And sure its gory and all that. But honestly. The movie is non-sensical. And that's why I used the word decadence in my title. Because by the end of this movie that is the ultimate emotional expressal you experience. How its worn, how its tired, wrong feeling, sad and self destructive. If that's what the director was aiming to nail, well done. You managed to capture that perfectly. But in my opinion, I don't see why we would want to experience this as viewers. You walk away feeling you've seen better, compared to Hannibal you never form a sense of catharsis. There is no greater knowledge gained from this. It has meant nothing. And that's because you discover not only what I've mentioned but the story takes a detour when it begins to focus on a the lead characters sister instead until she gets captured, goes to jail for murdering someone. Multiple people actually. Completely unhinged but whatever. And the baby sister with similar desires, for no bloody reason other than vegetarians tasting meat apparently triggers monstrous desires... life goes on only to discover that this apparently runs in the family. Being the cause of their vegetarianism. Look. I get the gorefest here is to some peoples liking. But I didn't enjoy it. It felt overdone, unfinished, sporadic, lackluster and extremely over the top to the extent that I just shook my head at times. The movie is decadent. Better movies have been done and those are the ones you should watch instead because they offer you an ending that actually gives you a sense of continuum with characters you enjoy, evil as they are. Sir Anthony Hopkins being a prime example, or Clarice Starling, being an incredibly interesting character. Why do I keep referring to Hannibal? For 2 reasons. Its story and characters. Well written, well done, and they have much more to them than just this mix of teen rebelliousness and the metaphor for desire, lust, lack of control translated into hunger for flesh. Because that is what it is. Make no mistake. We've seen the whole medical school gone nuts before. And it wasn't that well done the first time, nor second. And this movie is no different. You walk away feeling meh because of how it ends, because of how everything transpired, because of this awful music that tries so hard to nail the sad, hopeless atmosphere, when its not riling up the inner demon within you to have sex with everything including the dead and murder people. But yes. Enough of this rant/review. 3 out of 10. Absolutely tries to hard and ends up decadent, sad, without any catharsis WHATSOEVER. And the color palette amplifying the scenery, emotional turbulence manages only to capture death, sorrow, decay and rot. Even the sex scenes are touched by this. THe correlation between Hedonism and destruction in this movie served no purpose other than to annoy me. Watch something else. Want psychological horror. Watch Hannibal. Want gore? Watch Eat from 2014, or Excision. Those movies do this better.",Raw

How this film was ""so horrific"" that people left midway through the film after being so repulsed, they were physically ill. I went in with the - negative - expectation that this was going to be a gore fest. SPOILER: it's not. What we have here is a particularly grisly, but effective coming of age story, a genre the French have a penchant for. For a film about cannibalism, it's surprisingly subtle and is generally a slow burn that builds tension well. I found the performances uniformly strong, especially from Garance Millier. Her transformation from shy and socially awkward to animalistic and unhinged is a joy to watch. The atmosphere is well developed, especially those incredibly effective party scenes that perfectly capture what it's like at a wild college party. And I have to say, for such a twisted film, it's surprisingly sexy. Again, thank the French. No, it's not for the faint of heart and yes, some of the imagery is quite brutal. It could've have fleshed out - heh - some of the relationships between certain characters better, but overall, I'd recommend this to people with open minds and strong stomachs.",Raw

There were some moments during the movie in which I was genuinely scared by her and worried for her at the same time and I instinctively tended to bite my finger but I stopped halfway through and put my hands at the back.After the first 40 minutes I didn't think I was going to finish the movie. At first glance it seemed there was too much gore and too little story and you have to train an iron stomach for this movie. But later I found out it was worth it. I almost cried at one scene. My stomach still inside out but I had tears in my eyes.A very bizarre yet unique sister-hate-to-love-story. I'm not sure if this kind of mental disease or whatever you wanna call it - cannibalism - can really be inherited or was well depicted in the movie. Still, I enjoyed this different kind of horror when you can use gore not just for the sake of it but as a storytelling element.The beginning felt a tad unrewarding and things seemed to have no sense at all but later this problem was solved. I would have liked Adrien or the parents' characters to be explored more and this cannibalism thing should have also been explained better.

The acting seemed fine, I don't speak French so I can only really go on tone of voice, body language etc. I enjoyed the lead female character but I was left wanting more of a complete arc with her rather than what we get.

Some scenes of them biting each other just were strange especially in front of a crowd of people.I also hated many of the over the top characters and things they get up to(the ridiculous ceremony to join the vet place they are living plus the excessive scenes of students getting drunk, having sex and forcing others into disturbing situations)plus Raw doesn't know if its a cannibal or vampire type flick, as the main character Justine seems to love blood as well as human flesh, odd that.It has a really good first part and a grisly couple of twists towards the end(mainly Justine truly showing her ravenous ways in a shocking feast session)but too many annoying characters and drunken moments plus out of place sexual parts, got on my wick at times. I expected things like these in the movie but it was a bit over the top tbh.Not a disaster with great acting and proper gore filled scenes but it was for me a true let down.",Raw
98,stroggos,"RAW, a violent psycho-horror tale about vegetarianism",9,6 May 2017,"Justine enters vet school in France. There's horrible hazing rituals and wild parties. There's Alexia, her aggressive sister, a core member of a group of violent senior students. There's lots of animals needing to be dissected in class. And there is cannibalism. Amidst this frenzy, the burgeoning friendship with Adrien, her gay room mate, is Justine's only prospect of a more normal life.Trying to come up with a structured synopsis of RAW does the movie a disservice, as it progresses often more through association of images and music, and as it is driven more by mood and atmosphere than by particular plot events. That said, the story is compelling as a character portrait of a truly remarkable girl, and as a visceral study of the atrocities that humans are capable of.The movie is a clear allegory on the weirdness of human meat consumption—RAW is essentially a psycho-horror ode to vegetarianism: The students are kept in constant terror, just like animals on a meat farm. The students walk around in bloody coats throughout most of the movie, the same way that animals in mass production are kept in sometimes excruciatingly dirty conditions. And the the students themselves behave like animals, often being depicted in large flocks and reduced to their basic needs, such as their massive sex drives (it's a French movie: there's going to be graphic sex).The ideas are strong and will stick with you. But in the end, it's RAW's cinematography, the spot-on editing, the ingenious use of artificial lighting, and the powerful music, that are the movie's true hallmark. Music and imagery beautifully fuse together into a dreamlike kaleidoscope of violence, a rich tapestry woven in naked bodies, blood and carcasses.",Raw

102,cyberknight,Not raw,1,4 October 2017,"Warning, -= SPOILER ALERT =- already, because this is going to be a really raw review!The first scene shows a car crash, not accidental, and the one that caused it walks to the car and what happens is not shown, as the camera is purposefully set far away, as to not unveil the culprit or what it's doing. A young woman gets into veterinary college, the same her parents went to, who, by the way, are one-track-mind vegans. There she discovers that she has a cannibal hunger, which she cannot control. She then finds out that her older sister, who's a veteran in the same school, has the same cannibal hunger and, more over, she got a way to feed herself of humans. In the end, the great twist, it's revealed that their mother has also a cannibal hunger and had eaten chunks of their father... The end... No, I'm serious, that's literally the end of the film! Just after the father reveals the mother's secret, the credits start rolling...This film is not raw, it's underdone... Yes, I'm sure you saw it coming! The same way, I saw the ""end twist"" coming when I discovered, at about half an hour, that the woman had an uncontrollable cannibal hunger. All pieces fell together: the parents are crazy vegans, not because they don't want to eat meat, but because they can't ""wake"" the hunger; the older sister eats meat, what may only mean that she doesn't care about controlling her cannibalistic hunger (thus, she must be the one causing the car crash at the beginning of the film, it just happens that drivers on that road are stupid for never using seat-belts, so I guess they all deserve to die...)Even if it was a 5min short video, it would still be very boring. Unfortunately, it runs for an hour and half. How did they manage to fill an hour and half of boredom, one may ask. Well, it's filled with veteran students bullying newcomers for about half an hour (not continuously, it's spread along the film), another half an hour is filled with hereto-homosexual drama and the remaining is filled with hallucinogenic stupor, because when the woman gets into cannibal frenzy, she loses consciousness, the hunger takes full control and does all the horrible things... Although, there's nothing really horrible in this film, except two or three dead people, which are not shown dying or being eaten or anything, they are just dead, boring and lame.OF COURSE there is a lot of metaphors there, or should be, or was meant to be. Cannibalism is a symbol of sexual drive and whatnot bla-bla-blah... Girl wants to eat (homosexual) boy, desire for the forbidden or impossible, how subtle! No, not really. More over, the metaphor is all messed up, because the woman actually has intercourse with the homosexual roommate (I don't know what kind of school would put a man in the same room with a woman, but, well, engage ""suspension of disbelief"", or things are a lot different in France), so the cannibalistic symbolism just turns back to simply eating flesh of the same species, nothing else.Before the ending, there is a scene that shows all students going out to the open, absent-mindedly, for no explained reason. I read comments saying that all the students would be cannibals, that it would be a twist. I really didn't see any sign to corroborate that (like students eating each other or whatever), it was just dumb and made no sense (if it was a twist, it would naturally cancel the ""the mother is a cannibal/cannibalism is hereditary"" end twist, because we are informed right in the beginning that their parents also studied there and there was no sign that cannibalism was a ""new trend"" in that school).All in all, most of the film makes no sense or have stupid reasons or explanations. The bullying scenes and the psychotic music are unnecessary and annoying, the relationships are frivolous and annoying, the characters are thin, boring and annoying, the camera work and photography are pretentious and annoying... The film is just not more annoying than it is boring. I can take raw (sashimi, anyone?), I just can't take underdone...",Raw

Yeah it is all hidden and visible at the same time... a kind of conflict between good and evil. Or simply a human's struggle to set free from their animal condition. It is not really horror, though I am aware sick things exist in this world, I'm not ready to entertain those things in a movie. The horror genre is cliched for the supernatural and the grotesque. It always has something comical or funny about it. This movie is just a mirror of the dark side of our reality. Had it been a documentary with a better script, I would have given it an 8 out of 10, but labelled as a horror movie, it is a 5. Nice try though !",Raw
107,deeannratcliff,"Spoilers, you should read before your spoiled for life by this sick film",1,7 October 2018,"First I will say it was a well made film but still I would give it negative stars if I could. I am a huge fan of horror and thrillers and I've seen it all but this is the first film that literally repulsed me and truly made me ill. One reviewer said that for a movie about cannibalism it was subtle. I don't know what is subtle about a younger sister eating her big sisters finger after her passing out after accidentally cutting off her finger while giving her little sister a botched Brazilian wax, that's not the worst part, her sister covers for her and blames it on the family dog who ends up being euthanized which they think is too cute, mind you they are in school to be veterinarians. I pray veterinarians aren't in America as they are shown to be in France. Another review said that people got sick and left halfway through, I assume during the eating of the finger but if they had watched til the end they would have found it to be an excellent although grisly coming of age story. So, stupid me sat through the rest hoping to find some sort of redemption by the end. Older sis who lost the finger jumped in front of a car, for little sis so they could eat the dead from the wrecked car. In the end big sis kills little sis's gay want to be boyfriend which lil sis wakes up with and pulls down the cover to see his thigh has been devoured, she thinks she did it until finding big sis all full on kitchen floor with a bloody face. Big sis ends up in prison and lil sis is forced to eat her veggies by mommy and then daddy tells her why her and big sis have there little issue and shouldn't feel guilty by opening his shirt to show all the scars mommy left taking bites out of dad which is why mom has tried to make her a vegetarian. There, now you don't have to watch this disgusting movie I wish I hadn't, but no one can say my review is bad because I didn't watch til the end. I also really hope no dogs were killed or tortured for the dissection scenes! I'm not sure I will ever be able to eat again! There was nothing subtle about this movie, it was 100% sickening!",Raw

109,missraze,"I prefer the movie ""Ginger Snaps""",1,26 June 2017,"Now I've said in other reviews that I don't mind gross, bestiality, disturbing in films I watch. As long as it's not gross or sexual just for shock factor. However this was the most boring, unsexy, uncool, stupid movie I've seen in a while. I went from excitedly clicking on it and downloading and nibbling fries, to wondering what I'm gonna wear tomorrow. Once she started getting cannibalistic and going ballistic, ironically the movie got boring, haha. I'm sure that's when the movie was supposed to get exciting but I don't understand what her problem is, really. An hour, 15 minutes in, with 20 mins left, I don't understand yet why she's eating meat so obsessively, particularly raw unclean meat, and human meat? Other than the cliché insufficient excuse: ""because she's losing it."" OK, I get that, but WHY. I can infer all day, but what about doing your job as a script writer and filmmaker to answer every question your movie raises? What about an end goal? Was the purpose just to subject me to images that would damage my psyche? Why would someone do that? I mean, you learn how to answer a thesis in high school...maybe these filmmakers didn't go to high school.See there's a ton of similar movies, even in France, about carnivorous self-harm and the pathology behind it is explored in the film. Even if the movie sucks in general the main idea was addressed. Whether the person hates their self, is being pressured, or is trying to get closer to their self, or is traumatized, or changing into a freaking werewolf like in Ginger Snaps, the reason someone breaks down mentally to the point where they start picking at their skin like it's infected is explained. Here, I don't know, the only explanation was from the university nurse or someone: ""It must be food poisoning."" So this movie is basically exaggerated vegan propaganda, or anti-vegan satire, or? What? This movie is like Ginger Snaps meets Black Swan, except Black Swan is a bit tame and inhibited, but still manages to present itself as dark. This movie went way beyond the line Black Swan did with the gore and sexual scenes, and still was not dark nor scary, not even with that blasphemous rap song that apparently was helping her ""transform"" into a ravenous lust bot. The only thing good about this is the attempt to link the location to the psychosomatic downfall of the main character. I think the university setting wasn't for just any reason. Like The Shining, the location drove him mad. It forced him to mentally cave into himself because he had no distractions in such a desolate place as that hotel, and once he was distracted he lost it. Here, she loses her mind at the university. She's without her controlling mom for the 1st time, so she's having separation anxiety, and her older sister is a piece of **** anyway as she didn't even welcome her to the school or protect her, nothing. All her sister does is act as a catalyst to the main character's internal fray. It shows how ****ed up hazings are and what trying to fit in away from home for vulnerable young people can do if you don't have a strong value system. She did not have such, she had her mom forcing ideas like not eating meat down her throat which is why she was able to literally get meat shoved down her throat by her second-in- line guide, her older sister, who is sick in the head. Maybe she wants to relate to her older sister, connect to her, by involuntarily becoming like her, to cope with being away from home and going against what she knows for social survival. However, as deep a thinker as I am, the movie did NOT address this or state this! Not in script, not in visuals. This is me trying to make the most of time otherwise wasted. This movie wasn't even disturbing! It was worse than dammit Dogtooth. This was supposed to be scary and unsettling, huh, hence the little zoo porn stunts they keep pulling, the unnecessary gay sex, and of course the gore. But how with all of that, was it still boring?! It was. No idea why some critics have rated this so well, their pretentious egos must be getting stroked watching, rubbing their little chinny chinny chins at how profound and edgy they think this is, haha. It went from being a psychological breakdown of the main character, to some campus zombie f*ck fest, to some family cult. One girl in the movie said to the main character who was ill: ""Use two fingers. It makes the puke come up faster.""I think I'll do that.",Raw
110,chilversedward,Little modern horror gem,9,14 September 2019,I loved this film. It's funny in places and it's sink into horror is brilliant to watch as the lead role is slowly warped into some pretty gross behaviour.

Where are the special effects or tension building sound effects ?,6,12 September 2017,"The movie is highly entertaining with many twists and turns. The characters are well played and the plot keeps you guessing until close to the end. The themes of love, awkwardness, jealousy and friendship make this a film of not only sibling rivalry, but also romance, betrayal and hatred. At times it makes you feel slightly queasy as I suspect a good gory horror film should. There is more of a normal, reality style story-line too which makes it more relatable than a creaky old house with a gremlin in the cellar. It also keeps you entertained wondering where the evil is going to emerge from. In this respect it is a clever, well played tale which is certainly worth a watch. It is not the most terrifying of horror movies perhaps due to the lack of special effects or creatures but it's relatability and reasonable story-line keeps things enjoyable.",Raw
114,kikoydaba3,Raw falls flat without fully exploring or presenting a juxtaposition of growing cannibalism to social commentary about eroticism,5,28 July 2019,"Other than being an extremely gory take on subconscious primal hunger, Raw falls flat without fully exploring or presenting a juxtaposition of growing cannibalism to social commentary about eroticism in an emotional aspect. The themes are present, but it slugs along the way. Garance Marillier delivers a disturbing and electrifying performance that carries the film, as her character slowly spirals down towards cannibalism. The film's production design fails to convey a sense of claustrophobia that could nurture the protagonists primal hunger for flesh. As sexuality and cannibalistic desires collide, the scenes are truly terrifying. They are conveyed best with the characters, not the visuals, which is a let down.Raw leaves a mark for its violence alone, but not on an intellectual level.5/10",Raw
115,Arcturus1980,Truly moronic,1,3 November 2017,"I like to watch a horror movie every Halloween. Seeing that Raw had been well received and noted for its goriness, I thought, why not? Well, it is surely one of the worst movies I have seen in recent years. It not only has nothing whatsoever to say about the real world out there, it fails to make sense of its own ludicrous narrative. The themes are abstracted into utter meaninglessness. George Orwell's 1984 works as an exaggerated dystopia because he explored its themes with Stalin's Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany anchoring his creativity. Julia Ducournau created an impossible world so different from our own that it undermines its own themes by insisting on an incoherent narrative that reduces its disparate, disjointed scenes to a mere shock value that is itself oddly restrained and diluted by the incoherence. This is glossed-up, crap-for-brains storytelling. The setting is a school for veterinary medicine, and yet, how many of those who rate it a 7/10 or better would trust any of the characters with a houseplant, let alone their pet? In my opinion, The Handmaiden (also 2016) was interesting and very well made without saying much about life in general; a film absorbed in its own world, but coherently so. I very rarely review movies I hate, so I suppose this one is intriguingly loathsome and therefore not garden-variety dreck, to say all I can for it.",Raw

I spent most the film trying to pin down what the film was trying to parallel but really it seemed to be trying to relate to a whole host of modern coming of age issues, and in unresolved ways to feed on your fears; hence the tick box for being horror.So getting down to spoilers without particulars, the film sort of brushes on fetishism, the sexuality spectrum, drunken expression of yourself, abuse from your peers, being ordered by parents instead of informed, adults not having all the answers, freshman fears, sibling rivalry, dark family secrets... all very unsettling elements which only add to the more fantastical main theme which, although only a little forced at times, did a pretty good job at melding with reality to push our questions over getting the taste for human flesh into a state of suspended disbelief enough to uncomfortably forget that these are all special effects, given the chance.",Raw
121,reid-hawk,"The paradoxical nature of disgusting beauty: a film review of ""Raw""",9,14 June 2017,"""Raw"" is a 2017 French film and the first feature length film directed by Julia Ducournau. ""Raw"" is also absolutely NOT a horror film. This is something I feel like needs to be addressed immediately in this review and semi-analysis seeing as the film has been labeled and marketed as such. The film never really tries to scare or purposefully frighten you, although the subject matter is sure to disgust and horrify some. This film serves as more of a breaking down and mutation of the traditional coming-of-age tale rather than a fright fest, as well as the ""occasional"" fetishization of cannibalism. A very brief synopsis of the film is that our main character, Justine, is making the big step that many of us make in our lives by attending her first year of college, although instead of college she's following in her parent's footsteps by going to vet school, where her older sister already attends. Through a somewhat rigorous and brutal hazing ritual that forces her to forgo her vegetarianism and try raw meat, she learns that she has quite the taste for human meat. This is where the beautiful yet disgusting nature of the film arises. See, this film is beautiful in the conventional sense. It is wonderfully shot: filled with striking and beautiful visuals made more hypnotic and stunning due to the films quite gorgeous color-palette, where the sky and scenery remains quite gray and grim yet the people all seem bright and lively. It's refreshing in today's day and age where a film centered around millennials does not feel the need to be flashy with quick cut editing and overly charming and unrealistic dialogue. No scenes seem more evident to the director's talents than the party scenes. They are very fun to watch on screen with their flashing strobe lights and upbeat dance music, yet they never teeter on the edge of being unrealistic or over extravagant. They remind me of just about any frat party I have ever been to. What makes these scenes great, however, are the simplicity of the camera movements. There is no ""shaky cam"" or rapid editing. Instead the director chose to just follow Justine around in one-shot takes and simply observe her at the party. This unobtrusive camera-work is impressive, not only because of the amount of people in each shot and the number of things that could obstruct the camera, but also due to the fact Ducournau seems to understand that sometimes less truly is more, which is an idea I think a lot of modern directors could learn from. Now why do I say this is a paradoxical coming of age film? Well if what I just mentioned was the ""beauty"", then the raw (no pun intended) nature of cannibalism, bodily harm, and animal dissection shown is the ""disgusting"". Throughout the film human flesh becomes like a drug to our main character. She first tries it by eating pieces of her sister's finger that she just accidentally chopped off. At first she is repulsed by this nature, and tries to stop herself from repeating her actions. This causes her to go through what I interpreted to be withdrawal symptoms. During this time her sister also confesses to being a cannibal, and by confess I mean she runs into the road in front of an oncoming car, causing it to crash into a tree and kill its passengers, who she then begins to eat. Reading this without seeing the film makes it sound so stupid, but it really is not just about cannibalism. During and between these moments our main character is also learning about things we all must eventually learn in our lives. Things like sexual desires, genital hygiene, and learning who you truly are and who you want to become. Justine starts out the film as an awkward, goody-goody outcast, even going as far as to tell as doctor she'd rather keep her head down and just be average than have attention be brought on her. As the movie progresses she begins to somewhat come out of her shell, and as she does this her cannibalism progresses as well. Every leap she makes towards self-discovery also coincides with a leap towards cannibalism. In one scene she is making friends with her ""gay"" male roommate who really turns out to be at least bisexual, in the next they are eating sandwiches filled with meat. In another scene she is seductively dancing in front if a mirror as she listens to a song about ""fucking dead bodies"", seemingly accepting and embracing her sexual desires that she covered up earlier in the film. Later on we see her cannibalism is directly related to sex, in that while kissing during sex she also likes to bites her partner and taste his blood. To me I think the film means to show cannibalism as a sign that being who you really are can hurt other people, but covering it up will always hurt yourself. The very end of the film involves her talking to her dad. Her sister has just been arrested for killing Justine's roommate by eating him. Justine's mother is forcing her to become a vegan again, much to the chagrin of Justine. Her father tells her she will figure this thing out just like her mother did"" and he pulls down his shirt to reveal bite marks and chunks of flesh missing. This says a lot. Again it reinforces the theme of unintentionally hurting others to please yourself, and also shows how her mother wants to shield her daughter's from that part of their lives by forcing them to not eat meat. But like all coming of age tales the child must resist the confines of the parent and become the person they truly are.",Raw

Second, if you are expecting a more traditional horror film, you won't find it in Raw. What this movie does exceptionally well, is build suspense, keeping the audience on the edge of their seat as they sense what the pay off will be. And pay off it is. This movie depicts some horribly visceral, yet can't-look-away scenes of cannibalism, that are truly haunting. In between the scenes of horror, we are subjected to depictions of college life that seem sadly accurate, making the film that much more grounded and terrifying.

After a certain point of time she realizes that her appetite for human flesh is going beyond her control . Watch the film to find out if she manages to keep her hunger in check or goes on a rampage to hunt people for her survival.""Raw"" isn't exactly a horror film. It's not a thriller film either. It is an exotic 'art-house' film that shows blood and gore in the most artistic and realistic way possible. The movie shows that adolescence can be a very interesting period in one's life because that's when one is introduced to situations that could trigger a zillion desires and the game of 'psychological tug-of-war' one needs to play to decide if certain desires should be curbed.""Raw"" ain't no vampire film. The posters can be slightly misleading so I want to inform you once again that this is not a commercial potboiler meant to make millions of dollars at the box-office.

Technically it's ok but it losses credibility due to the script and also is peppered with lots of pointless scenes, sometimes short shots that don't add anything or mean anything.
It has a series of odd things like for istance a lady doctor smoking while talking to the lead character (smoking in a doctor's room in 2017?) , the university initation ceremony seems a bit over the top, the teachers seem oblivious to their antics or don't seem to care, mattresses spread on the floor outdoors of the residential complex for a week, seriously? a dog, a big one, living in the university residence with the sisters?
So I didn't like the script and the editing with the pointless scenes. The music is not good either. The best thing in the movie would be the photography.
Ok, it has some repulsive scenes like the one where she eats the finger but I imagine terror movie fans will also be disappointed as there is not much terror or gore in it.

On the outside this movie is a simple body horror story trying to use gross imagery to shock audience for cheap thrills, but there is so much underlying meaning behind this film. The connections to her transformation have deep connections to the development that a woman goes through in her life and it is through the grass images that Julia Ducourau tries/succeeds in giving the audience a look into what every woman goes through.

136,robbieclaravall,Raw is a story of humanity seen through the narrative of a cannibal.,10,25 May 2017,"Raw concerns Justine, a 16 year old gifted teen who is ready to take on her first year in vet school, where her older sister also studies. She is a vegetarian, and has all her life been applying to her rules. Once she gets in school, hazing starts right away where she is forced to eat raw rabbit meat. After, unexpected consequences emerge as her true self begins to form.Raw is marketed as a cannibalism horror movie, where its gimmick comes from people fainting during screenings of this at movie festivals. I can see how certain expectations can ruin this movie for someone, as this truly isn't a horror movie. It is a drama, a coming of age story about a young veterinarian student who undergoes an identity crises and a sexual awakening. It examines addiction and how an abuse of addiction can lead to a thorough change of character, enslaved by the horrors of obsession. It is also a story of two sisters and the bond they create, exhibiting personal development as they support each other through their trials throughout the film. It studies all of these complex themes, and looks at it with an additional ""what if?"" concept of cannibalism. It is definitely a ridiculous set-up, but it somehow works here.It might get a little bit silly if looked at literally, but the film challenges the viewer to look at life with a unique set of lens, as some events portrayed at this film are truly outlandish. That's where it gets its appeal, for me at least, though. The story, on the surface, is seen as a woman who has a sudden craving for raw meat, but beneath that are layers and layers of labyrinthine ideas of change and, essentially, growing up. One can view the cannibalistic aspects as a huge metaphor for all its contexts, and that's also a certain way of mindset at going about the film. That's what's so great about the film; it is profound enough to provoke multiple interpretations from the viewer.The rest of the film is stellar. The actors are fantastic. Garance Marillier as the lead does a good job of character transformation, from subtle acts to actual cannibalistic performances. Ella Rumpf as her sister may be a supporting character, but she steals all the scenes that she is in. The score used is spectacular and strangely fitting to some of the film's more brutal scenes. The narrative is fairly simple enough to follow, but what really separates this film from all other dramas is how utterly original it is in how it faces its problems and themes. That's the selling point for me.Raw is a terrific film. It is profound, and not at all the cannibalistic horror movie the masses were expecting. Everything about it is fantastic, from the actors, to the score, to its themes, and to the character's personal transformation from start to finish. I can see how this won't be for some people, but for those who can stomach grotesque scenes, Raw is worth a look. It is a story of humanity seen through the narrative of a cannibalistic woman, and the result is multilayered and at times, metaphysical.",Raw

Being a big fan of horror, I have always been fascinated with cannibalism in both fiction and real life, so I just knew I had to watch it somehow. And the movie is very good, I really enjoyed it. First thing you need to know is this is not your typical cannibal movie. It is not a Cannibal Holocaust or a Green Inferno and it is not even a Silence of the Lamb. What really gripped me about the film is it is not about a serial killer or an evil tribe capturing and eating trespassers. The movie is actually a coming of age story, centering on a first year veterinarian student's slow descent into hell, transforming from a vegetarian to having an insatiable hunger for human flesh.Justine is heading off to college to become an animal doctor. She goes to this school where hazing of freshman is a tradition. The very first night they get their beds thrown out the window, have animal blood splatter all over them and are forced to eat raw intestines by their seniors. The main character is a meek, quiet girl who is not used to the harsh treatment she is receiving, so she finds solace with her gay male roommate, Adrien and her older sister who also goes to the school, Alexia. After being forced to eat a raw rabbit kidney, Justine develops horrible rashes all over her body, and her thirst for blood and flesh is unlocked. Justine's developing desire to consume human meat can be interpreted as an allegory for many things one in real life might discover, be it sexuality or the belonging in a social clique. This subtext adds an extra layer to the movie beyond the blood and violence.The movie is a horror film without the use of jump scares or other conventions; instead the scares rely solely on tension and suspense which in turn stem from the unpredictability of the characters. At certain points, I was truly surprised at some of the turn the movie takes, and I was my holding breath whenever two characters are alone together in a room with the back of my mind telling me something ""might"" happen, and even if nothing ends up happening, the scene still works because of how it took my breath away. I actually flinched more in this film than others that are far more violent. Mainly because the movie grounds itself into reality, a reality with real people in a realistic setting, so when the violence hits, it hits hard. I never cover my eyes in even the goriest of films, but I almost did here. Not going to spoil anything, but there was one scene involving an allergy and another involving Brazilian wax and scissors that almost made me pause the movie. The quality of the scares and violence in this movie goes to show you, you do not need a bucket of blood or a numerous loud noises to be effective. What is more effective is having a good script, good actors and the filmmaking talents to play with the audience's expectations.I do not understand French, but I could still tell the acting in this movie is very good all around. I want to especially applaud Garance Marillier who plays Justine in the movie. She was really good, and I really bought her as both the timid vegetarian and the disinclined cannibal she slowly becomes. The director really puts this young actress through some hell, as she is covered in blood, rashes or some other bodily injuries throughout most of the movie, and you feel sorry for her, but at the same time, fear her. This is a testament to Marillier and I really hope she does not get typecast the rest of her career so I can see her in other things.There are some flaws to be had the movie. I felt the pacing of the movie was little off during the second act. Some of the character motivations was not really explained really well, so the editing seems disjointed. Justine goes from a vegetarian in one scene to sneakily eating raw chicken in another without much of a smooth transition. And the ending was kind of disappointing in my opinion as it felt like the director did not know how to end the movie, so she had one of the characters make a choice that was alluded to the entire movie. This is really unsatisfactory because up to that point the movie was tension- filled and unpredictable. Why Julia Ducournau chose to end the movie in such an obvious way leaves me in wonder.Overall I think Raw is a very good horror movie that is anything but typical. The tension stems from character development, and not a masked killer with a machete. It does have some pacing issue and a copped-out ending, and it is not a perfect movie nor is it for everybody. Fans of cheap jump scare horror might not enjoy this movie, and those who are squeamish probably will not be able to sit through it either. But if you are someone who enjoys a well-acted, character drama juxtaposing with some really intense horrific scenes, then by all means, please go and watch Raw.",Raw

139,fpcholcomb,A Complicated Portrait of a Young Monster,8,9 October 2018,"Raw is a disturbing journey that packs a good deal emotional weight beyond its absurd premise. At its core the film is a coming of age story, but the frightening twist is that this is a coming of age story for a cannibal. As the story begins we are introduced to a jittery young vegetarian girl being dropped off at a veterinarian school by her somewhat aloof parents. Immediately the imagery is bleak, the school looks more like an abandoned hospital that a place of higher education. There is a real sense of tension that builds for the first 30 minutes or so painting what one may see as normal college debauchery into something more sinister, something darker.Raw does a great job cultivating its atmosphere, painting the world in the light the Justine, the main character, would see it in. The cinematography is quite excellent, characters are often examined intimately while their surroundings are left vague and isolating enhancing . The acting from Garance Marillier as the Justine is quite good, and she really sells teenage angst while at the same time selling a craving for human flesh. You feel for her plight, even though we cannot exactly empathize with the need to taste human flesh, one can extrapolate her pain into any number of misfit pains that accompany journeying to a new place when you are young and unsure of yourself. The film horrifyingly addresses how some can inherit deficiencies from their parents that are far too easy to succumb to when you are out on your own, and that there may not be an answer to what ails you. Raw is a complicated portrait of a young monster that runs a gambit of emptions from disgust to compassion. It is a bold, artistic film that deserves a view from anyone who can stomach the graphic nature of its subject matter.",Raw

141,coldwarkid,very disappointed,4,30 June 2019,"It's not really a horror film, it's a tries-too -hard-to- be- arty teen flick with the cannibalism merely a device. Perhaps I'm being a little unfair, but I've looked forward to seeing this for some time, mainly because of the hype and it was a let down. It was well .made and good to look at but that's all. I only stuck it out to the end because of the supposed big reveal which turned out to be a damp squib and was obvious from the first scene.",Raw
142,RobertWhitebrow,Angsty teenage cannibals - the movie.,5,15 December 2020,"So, this movie is not a complete wreck. Although to enjoy it you must really put some effort into suspending your disbelief. It has the specific disregard for all things logically coherent and instead follows a path of raging raw emotions of the allegedly cathartic variety, that is so typical of french horrors. Once you get to your 5th ""this makes absolutely no sense"" you have to either turn it off or start perceiving it as a roller coaster ride - it will do its best to shock you without providing an answer to why or how. After all, you got on the ride. That being said, is the movie a 7? In absolutely no universe. Is it kind of a 5? I'd say yes as it does have some redeeming qualities like back to back loop de loops of people biting fleshy chunks off of each other. If you're into that sort of thing you'll be satisfied. If not, you'll get off the ride with a distinctly nauseated feeling.The ""plot"" (and I use the term generously) follows a family that sends their youngest daughter to vet school. Same school where the older daughter also attends as did the parents. So they are veterinary royalty or at least alumni. The entire family is vegan (hint-hint, nudge-nudge). The hazing ritual that the girl goes through aside from committing what seems be a series of felonies, also makes her taste animal meat. For some reason that triggers the vegan to start craving meat of the raw variety.From here on the ""plot"" moves forward like an intoxicated chipmunk on a well-oiled surface. It manages to both be all over the place and get nowhere at the same time. You have your standard long drawn out close-up shots of the characters supposedly contemplating something, that only angsty teenagers are privy to. The two sisters have a love-hate relationship so they are either hugging, or fighting, or comforting each other, or biting chunks from each other. Or all four in the same scene together. You have a couple of supporting characters that act more like props for the main cast. Overall it has some decently gory scenes although what irked me the most is how the school, which based on its hazing practices is an absolute degenerate hellhole, all of a sudden gets its halo and starts gasping at the actions of the two sisters.The twist ending can be seen a mile away but at least it's there. That being said it also does not fail to deviate from the general illogical behavior of the characters - all women in the family are cannibals and as soon as the mother started tearing off chunks from the father way back when, that's when he knew he loved her. In a day and age where couples break up over someone liking the wrong person's photo on facebook, this is certainly a display of iron-clad commitment! OR complete BS, you be the judge.In any case, if you're not squeamish you might enjoy this one for the scenes so give it a go.",Raw

The movie is a little insane btw, so it is confusing if I like it or hate it.Besides the thrilling you get the film also presents in an accurate way the French culture which happens to be very kinky and sick.

It's not simply a cannibalistic body-horror movie (in that regard, one could argue it's somewhat soft for the genre, but it will still be disturbing for people who are not familiar with this kind of films), but a well-crafted coming-of-age, dramatic movie, were the main character, masterfully played by a really young Garance Marillier, has to battle her instincts. It also incorporates witty bits of social commentary and sarcastic and acid humour, and some of the scenes, albeit gory, are simply hilarious (I was equally amused and grossed out by most of them). If you already are familiar with this type of movies, or if you have an open mind and a strong digestive track, I would definitely recommend this movie. If you are someone really sensitive to blood or gory imagery, then this is not your film.",Raw

I.E. Student goes off to college. Is forced to drink. Becomes an alcoholic.
So, you are obsessed with eating people. Not drinking booze.
My problem is that she and her sister just adjust to murdering people on the road. Sure, her sister goes to prison. Her mom makes her eat her vegetables again. But, the film makes the insanity of addiction look like a 'coming of age' venture into self-discovery. Other critics say that she was finding herself as a woman. No she wasn't. She was pitifully and insanely obsessed. I don't think the director and screenwriter have any clue when it comes to addiction. And this low rating has nothing to do with the gore. I didn't mind that.",Raw
147,TwentyWasHere,"Good premise, but Ducournau has no idea how to turn it into a movie.",3,31 October 2017,"So another French horror flick. Usually they receive high ratings on IMDb but are either hit of miss for me. RAW (Grave) is clearly one of the later. The movie has no plot and no character development. You do not care about the main protagonist because we don't know nothing about her beside that she is a vegetarian.And when the cannibal aspect of the movie comes in there is zero progression. They just flip a switch. And you do not care at all about the protagonist. It makes no sense. You just keep watching in hope that at least the gore will escalate. Nah, it doesn't. Basically after the finger scene they blew their load.And that is the only thing they had going for the movie: ""Vegetarian turns cannibal"". There is nothing more to see here. Sure, they tried to spice it up a bit with a few more uninspired gore scenes that somewhat have a retro feeling. Most of the time they just tried to be edgy, which seams enough these days to make a killing at the box box office in the US. French horror cashes in easily in the US regardless if there is any substance to warrant this.As the writers did not have a story to begin with - beside the tag- line as noted above - there is naturally no ending, hence they just added a random twist to it that makes no real sense. Overall not much can be seen of the director's claim to make the audience emphasize with the protagonist. The extend of character development is ""She is a vegetarian with cannibal urges"". That's it. There is no development or journey. You just don't care about her.The actors do a decent job, but once more had nothing much to work with as none of the characters are fleshed out or have any development. Production value overall is decent given the small budget, camera work good (style over substance approach aka ""edgy""), but the soundtrack starts to get annoying quickly. There are some good moments and good makeup effects though.As said the concept of ""vegetarian turns cannibal"" is an interesting one. But just trying for something new doesn't make it brilliant. The movie lacks some real writer attached to the project that gives the characters depths and progression through conflict as well as a plot to begin with.Ducournau has a good premise to start with but ultimately she lacked the skills to turn that high concept into a movie.You might consider re-watching ""Ginger Snaps"" instead, which did a much better job at a similar story. The movie clearly took a lot of inspiration from ""Ginger Snaps"". And all the edginess comes from trying emulate some of Argento's early surreal works, without really understanding how it worked.I rate this 3 out of 10 for trying out something new and a few good moments, but ultimately this movie fails at being a movie. It would worked better as a short.",Raw
148,vladhxh,"A smart horror story, for a change",8,30 September 2018,"It's slow-moving and uneventful at times, but this coming-of-age movie has a strong, more or less coherent plot, that is so often lacking in the horror movies of late. Frankly, it's not even a horror movie, as in it does not rely on cheap scares. It covers a ground familiar to everyone who's looking at a deeper context of the modern films - trying to get a better understanding of our animal nature and an explanation of our motivation, both of the individuals and the species. In my mind, it still doesn't get it completely, but it's getting pretty close, so that you can have a clearer picture of the world once you finish it, especially if you haven't been able to formulate the antagonisms of a modern human life. It is a movie, after all, and it's pleasing in it's images and sound. The actresses seem to be competent and believable, the gritty pictures, sometimes flowing with blood also look natural, you sort of understand that they are there not only for the shock value. It definitely doesn't feel like a rehashed story in a world where originality (rawness?) is getting extremely rare.",Raw

It's not a bad film, there's just not sufficient substance to warrant the in-depth discussions and analysis it's receiving. It's the travails of a young person - female, of course, because for some reason people want to think women are dark and mysterious - as she finds her adult identity, but with cannibalism. All the other, usual stuff, too, just, y'know... plus cannibalism. I'm all for hyperbole as a way to make a point, but hyperbole is all it is, not an added layer of meaning. I don't really understand making the central story of your film a metaphor for something which is also happening in it literally. I suppose that's my biggest point of criticism and why, ultimately, the whole thing feels a bit pointless. Frankly, the only lingering effect of the film for me is that I want to know whether the dogs we see at the vet school were special effects wizardry or if I was just forced to watch a real dog being dissected.",Raw

This is a dark, cruel and disturbing horror film which gets even unbearable, but everything that take place work for the sake of a truly inspiring screenplay which provides amazingly well-written characters (one of the best character studies i have ever seen in horror film) and also runs as a clever allegory about the awaking of sexuality in a repressed environment.

She begins a sort of metamorphosis, psychically and physically that will bring her in a spiral of horror.
All of this while she is oppressed by older students' hazing.The film is surely a metaphor of changes during and after puberty.

The reason 20 people walked out and two fainted is because RAW is one of the most intense films to come out of the European state in quite awhile,The crime of RAW is not that it is provocative it is that has the intelligence to smooth it over with focused direction and smart writing thanks to the helm at both ends, Julie Doucornow in her debut. Justine,played by an excellent Garance Marillier is a strict vegetarian in first year in veterinarian school On the first night her dorm is raided by senior students and so begins the process of a week long hazing exercise, One afternoon she is forced to eat a raw rabbit kidney. The results are almost immediate as she discovers within herself a craving for meat and as with the title preferring the raw variety. With all these events happening at the same time she struggles to find her place in school. Juggling students, family, teachers with a crippling disease I found my self drawing similarities between this and Brian De Palma's CARRIE. Justine, at a loss slowly succumbs to cannibalism but you won't see any zombies or Italian inspired cannibals here. The second act leads us to the reasons all those people walked out and missed the payoff and satisfying end.

165,Hitchcockyan,Rawrrrrrrr!,8,28 May 2017,"Julia Ducournau's riotous debut feature is a coming-of-age tale spliced with cannibalistic horror. RAW is a visceral and curious attack on the senses, it is repulsive and arousing - often at the same time.The plot follows Justine - the youngest daughter of a family of vegetarian veterinarians, as she arrives at college to pursue her familial vocation. Thrust into the unrelentingly sadistic hazing week (which among other things will warrant a departure from her dietary constraints), Justine embarks on a gory odyssey of self-discovery.The heavily pronounced creepy visual aesthetic is maintained throughout, right from its terrifying veterinary school setting which at first glance gives off an ""inmate-run-asylum"" vibe, with customary behaviours ranging from socially-unacceptable to downright psychotic. And of course the unsettling ubiquitousness of the animals - alive and dead - further amp up the hallucinatory visuals to almost Lynchian levels. But the stomach-churning gore is smartly equalised by a keen sense of character and a savage sense of humour. Garance Marillier's turn as the initially mild- mannered, devout vegetarian Justine who subsequently devolves into a lustful, flesh-crazed carnivore is the backbone of this enterprise. Ella Rumpf is equally impressive as her apathetic elder sister with a dark streak.Not everything works however, the adversarial sibling dynamic feels haphazardly motivated, characters take convenient sexual detours purely to serve the plot, and the climactic twist at best works as a mildly-amusing punchline. But despite its under-cooked symbolisms and flawed narrative RAW remains a cinematic feast boasting extreme imagery and wicked performances.",Raw

168,bentheredfan,"At times overly exploitative and a little underwhelming, but for the most part, a finely cooked meal of horror/thriller madness.",7,26 July 2018,"This movie is, at its core, a morality tale about peer pressure, firmly held convictions, and the negatives of helicopter parenting. Yes, it is dressed in the masquerade of cannibalism and the peer pressure of a freshman year of college, and it fits quite well I might add, but this movie is (primarily) about the slow, steady decline that occurs when you begin to let your morals slip. Personally, I don't believe it is objectively wrong to eat meat. However, the writer's choice to utilize a vehicle of vegetarianism here doesn't bother me and it serves its purpose quite well. I don't want to spoil too much, but it's quite easy to identify the symbolism presented here. As previously stated, none of this makes this a bad movie. Quite the contrary; it is extremely well done and interesting. This is partly due to the subject matter; it is such a controversial topic that you really do have to keep watching just to see how it ends. That said, it is EXTREMELY dark and exploitative. There are rare moments of recovery here and those presented are often quite strange. Perhaps more than scary, the film WILL make you uncomfortable and/or disturbed. I primarily view horror movies and even I had to do some double takes. Be prepared for that, and word to the wise, do not view this in mixed company. Star Garance Marillier is easily the strongest aspect of the film, and the other reason you just cannot stop watching. She is innocent, vulnerable, gullible, and scared... and yet also dishonest, manipulative, dangerous, and decadent. You can relate to her struggle and root for her, but at the same time, some part of you is against her and maybe even hates her. The rest of the cast, at least in comparison to Marillier, fades into the background, which isn't always a good thing. Some of the exploitation here aims so high for shock value that it loses its effect and feels pointless. Further, it removes you from the film. There were two or three times I would find myself immersed, only to be shaken out by pointless indecency. The whole thing is in French as well (I watched with English captions) and again, be prepared for a very bleak, yet somehow cautionary and careful, film.",Raw

One star off because of the somewhat weaker ending...it felt unfinished and not really clear as to what REALLY happened....otherwise definitely worth watching.",Raw
170,benthelazar,A brilliant horror debut,10,17 March 2017,"Picture: David Cronenberg, Lars Von Trier and H. P. Lovecraft make a movie, but they only take the good parts of their works and cut out the silly, boring and ugly bits. Still you will not have as beautiful, evocative and disturbing of a film as Julia Ducournau's RAW, a movie that immediately takes you hostage and never lets you go. Here is a gut churning, deeply alive work that assaults you with disgusting, thought provoking and existential horror until you can't take anymore. It's a good thing that I felt more anxious than excited at the end, that is the mark of good filmmaking. RAW takes place in a veterinary school from hell, when we first see it it is too big, isolated and Gothic to comprehend. Justine (Garance Marillier) comes to the school after her parents and sister Alexia (Ella Rumpf). She is immediately alone and in over her head; the school has a series of sadistic hazing rituals that involve excessive drinking, violent raids, Carrie reenactments and eating raw meat, even for Justine the vegetarian. The audience is immediately hit with the cruelty of this world, a school doctor tells a story about a large girl who cried when her weight was finally ignored, the women share tips on how to most effectively be bulimic. It's so gratifying when a movie does this, unlike other recent brilliant horror films like Get Out or Don't Breathe, there is no normal here. When the world of the film becomes more and more bizarre, we as an audience have nothing to stand on. And oh, the film becomes bizarre. But like any good film, the insane images are grounded in reality, character and story. The horrific sequences in this movie are beautiful to watch , the colors and cinematography look like paintings. Justine is starting to crave raw meat, there's a short but gorgeous scene where she kneels feral in front of a refrigerator tearing into a chicken breast. Because this is a horror film, the best meat is soon revealed to be human and it is because of Marillier's brilliant performance that we are able to see just how painful but exciting this new desire is. The meat isn't meat in RAW, it is a very clear metaphor for Justine's sexual liberation. In one of the best scenes of the movie, Justine watches her male friend play soccer shirtless; it is simultaneously deeply terrifying and erotic moment that Ducournau directs in a way that feels exactly right. At a certain point in the film, we can never guess if Justine is hungry or aroused.Violence has been a semi sexual act in horror for years, but with this film it feels fresh, the desires and reactions are all new. They are also deeply troubling and have a beautiful intensity to them that can only be described as animal or inhuman. Ducournau is at her best here, the erotic and gory passages of the film are directed with the skill and confidence of an old master returning to the screen, not someone in their debut. What makes RAW so good though is how massive it seems. With a few exceptions, horror is a small genre. Often horror films lack a cosmic significance; they fail to have implications beyond the characters on screen. Through her haunting images, brilliant world building and disturbing soundtrack, Ducournau communicates something larger. Female sexuality, from this film, isn't something to be taking lightly. Justine's self discovery is a ferocious and earth shattering moment, after which no one will be the same.",Raw
171,courtney_london,"Creepy, grotesque - must watch for all horror fanatics!",8,1 December 2017,"The Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) always has some great movies for their Midnight Madness group. In 2016, Raw was no exception. The French film is dark, gloomy, almost cold feeling which adds a certain creepiness to the beginning of the film. Story is fairly simple: vegetarian girl goes to vet school; cannibalistic hazing occurs; crazy stuff happens! Slow start to the movie, but picks up the pace toward the middle which keeps your eyes glued to the screen in anticipation of what is to come. The film becomes terrifying and horrid, but so intriguing that you can't help but focus a little bit more on the screen and what is happening to the characters in the film. The ending of the film really ties things together as to almost resolve the ""why"". This is definite recommend for horror fanatics! But not recommended for vegetarians or those that get nauseous easily.",Raw

This film was beyond awful; no rhyme or reason for anything portrayed here - just violence and gore for the shock value of the acts committed, I suppose.

But scenes of animal torture, consuming raw meat, puking hair covered in stomach bile is just disgusting. It's not horror, it's repulsive. I don't feel fear when I see these images, I feel disgust. Maybe that's your thing, maybe you look for this in your movie, I can respect that. But movies such as this should not be tagged as ""horror"" movies, and I don't thing they deserve high scores simply because they're ""radical"".I actually got sick watching this.

Raw is one of those things that's disgusting and grotesque, but so intriguing that you can't look away. All the acting seems good, and the characters are interesting enough. The movie takes a bit of time to really pick up, and some scenes can seem pointless (like a lot of the hazing rituals) but from there I had my eyes glued to the screen. The themes this movie has about human instinct is so terrifying and horrid, but is so entertaining because of the way the main character turns from a normal girl into something much different. A lot of people are critiquing the ending of this movie too, but I loved it!Overall, this movie is definitely worth a watch.

178,cody-phillipsphotography,Horror at its finest,10,25 May 2017,"As stated many times, there seems to be a resurgence of horror films. Horror, for some time, had fallen into a sense of being generic, with no smart horror films being released. Big budget horror films reigned for some time before found footage became the new wave of horror. This phase has lasted for many years now, but horror is shifting. Rather than big budget films, independent horror films are the hottest films on the market, producing the best horror films at the moment. There are a couple of big budget director like James Wan that really are doing horror justice in the major studios, but independent horror is where the genre is thriving.Sitting hidden in these independent horror films is Raw, a film that was brought to notoriety when it screened and patrons were reported to have passed out while watching it. A film with a history like this is always going to garner attention, which seems to have passed now that it is out of the festival scene. While this film may not have the same publicity that it did when it premiered, this film certainly is not a film that is to be ignored. With smart horror films being a rare find, even with many smart horror films finally being released, Raw is definitely a film that needs to get attention again.Described by many as a cannibalistic feminist horror film, Raw proves that contemporary issues can be present in horror films, building off of these issues. Gender roles and the idea of feminism run through this film, motivating some characters to do actions, while examining these in a new light. College hazing was another very interesting aspect that was examined, as there has been several other films that deal with hazing that have been released within the past several years. Raw takes a more gruesome approach to hazing, but nonetheless shows the process of hazing and the effects that it has on new students. The film was centered on these contemporary issues, making the film as relevant as ever.For many horror films, the horror aspect of the film is blunt. Torture porn is the best example of blunt horror, where the intention of the film is to show violence, there is no other reason for the film to exist. This tactic does work for certain sub-genres of horror, but blunt horror would not have been as effective with Raw. Rather than bluntly displaying horrific images, this film embraces subtlety, a feature that many well-done horror films follow. While there are many horrifying images portrayed throughout the film, the true horror lies beneath the surface. Horror comes in many different forms and Raw shows that societal issues can be just as horrifying as spirits or gore.It seems that many of the well-done horror films have been directorial debuts, with Raw being another one of those great first films. Julia Ducournau's direction in the film feels like it is coming from a season director, rather than someone directing their first full-length film. She has an understanding of the horror genre, clearly displaying techniques that many other horror directors have used before, like doing dramatic close-ups on faces. Ducournau uses a very distinct palate, consisting of many shades of blue, but also utilizes many other colors during certain scenes that make the film have a very unique look. It really is baffling to think that this is her directorial debut, since it feels like she's done at least a couple other horror films before this one.Raw is a film that has a reputation to live up to, since several people reportedly had to leave due to the gore. As a seasoned viewer of horror, the gore wasn't a bother, but the scenes with the animals were the scenes that were the most difficult to watch. Many of the scenes that had gratuitous amounts of gore in it were brutal, but the scenes involving animals really were the hardest to get through. As someone who never wanted to become a veterinarian, these scenes were awkward and hard to watch, just because the procedures were so foreign.Horror really is starting to go into interesting places, with Raw showing just where horror is capable of going. There are many modern horror greats, with this film raking high among those great horror films (ranking among films like The Witch and It Follow). It's rare to find a social critique in a horror film, let alone a film that discusses feminism and gender roles, so it is refreshing to find a film that manages to be terrifying, yet still is smart. Raw lives up to its reputation, being one of the most gruesome films to have come out recently.",Raw
179,fobisaxa,Raw THE Independent french horror movie,8,12 April 2017,"The best horror films are dramas. This much has always been true. With Raw, the family drama of the difficult relationship between the protagonist and her sibling serves not as a backdrop to the gore. Rather, it transcends and enhances the grotesque imagery. Well acted from all sides and written with surprising sensitivity and thought, it poses some seriously dark questions about pleasure, basic human need and sexuality, and the rather thin line between them all.Having said all that, the graphic display of blood, guts and deformed flesh are easily the most memorable of all. They have the ability to simultaneously turn the stomach, admire the talent of the actors and also to commend the production design, make-up and cinematography.Raw is an intensely disturbing film that decides not to judge the weird and often psychotic characters, but to display human desire for exactly what it is, in the nastiest way possible.",Raw

185,phosie-943-377317,Raw flesh & emotion,8,26 December 2019,"The movie not just manages to display raw, strong emotion, without making it seem overblown, but actually tie it into an engaging, intelligent story and good acting. Especially the twist that only gets revealed at the very end adds a lot to it, imo.
I haven't seen something like this for a long time in recent cinema. This movie withholds nothing of the details of what it really means to grow up and be confronted with the world of sexuality and associated primordial urges, such as aggression and lust in general. At first sight a coming of age movie, but really deals with the universal theme of the so-called human condition.Most people don't really dare to explore what you can find in the depths - if you, like the protagonist, go against your conditioning and follow the mysterious pull from the depths of your being. I've read much criticism towards how ""unrealistic"" this movie is - sure, something like this probably wouldn't happen nowadays exactly as depicted (regarding the events in the college), but I see the cannibalism and the morbid and extreme actions of the sisters towards each other as more symbolic in nature. At times the movie really becomes almost surreal and takes on a very nightmarish vibe - not through gory, out-of-this-world imagery, but through its very real intensity, which becomes experienced and portrayed rarely.It's like the deepest fears and dark dreams, hidden deep in the subconscious of both sisters, and humanity in general (public humiliation, taboos such as cannibalism and even eating raw meat, the shadow archetype), become gradually more exposed and a lived reality. And I found precisely that very engaging. It is much more psychological than an actual cannibal movie - the horror and unease is latent, subtle, and at certain moments flows over. All the while still maintaining the tone of modern, urban everyday life.And while everything seems to become more bizarre and riddled, just at the very end, comes a rather unexpected and yet very plausible twist and explanation for the behaviour of the sisters, which at times almost seemed to stem from actual demonic possession.At its heart this movie isn't about cannibalism but, imo/experience, about family systems/generational trauma and how younger generations are left to sort out the problems their forebearers were unable to face and solve themselves. The human condition with a special focus on youth and coming of age. It also shows that, despite technological advances, growing up still can be as harsh as ever.All in all an intense and well made movie, worth watching, if one is open to it.",Raw

I wouldn't say Raw is a disgusting movie full of gore and nasty stuff, it's just edgy. If you are looking for that kind of things you are better off exploring gore websites with real footage. If you expect a story with maybe some decent amount of logic, I'd say the same, go look somewhere else. But this is just my opinion, watch the movie and form your own.",Raw
188,mauroartista,An intense journey.,9,25 January 2018,"You might've heard the hype behind this one, that people couldn't even finish this movie because of its gory nature. And while there is some gore, I believe it's just used when it is needed, they don't over do it. That is not to say that this is an easy watch, it isn't, but it isn't one of those gross out movies either.I didn't really know a lot before watching the movie and was pleasengly surprised by the atmosphere of the whole movie. The actors did a great job, specially Garance Miller. What I loved about this movie is that it's not simply about cannibalism, it's a journey. the journey of a shy young girl who is in the process of discovering herself. The composer of the main theme of the movie, Jim Williams, probably doesn't get enough credit for his amazing work. My favorite scene in the whole movie fits the theme so well, it's hard imaging it without it.All in all, this movie can be a hard watch, but it's totally worth it.",Raw
189,bronwynbirkholz,Delightfully Tasteful,8,10 October 2018,"In the genre of cannibalism horror, I feel it's hard to find a film done completely right. RAW is believable and establishes a well created relationship between the sisters.
Scenes carry the right amount of tension and the shots are done well. I particularly enjoyed how they played with color during various scenes.
I would have maybe liked to see more of the psychology of her transition into cannibalism, instead of it constantly being some unseen, uncontrollable urge the main character seems to have. They never really discuss the sisters method of obtaining human flesh via car accidents either. 
The body horror and gore isn't over done and even a bit more subtle at times which added to my enjoyment of the film. The acting is pretty excellent, especially that of the older sister.

191,codseyes,Truly shocking,7,20 September 2017,"This is not US-style, ""Stephen King"" horror, indeed it will probably be seen as a watershed (or bloodshed!) in the genre. Shocks on several levels, and reverbs again and again on reflection. The focus opens on the traditional, nasty French uni first year initiation rites, and we're lulled into thinking that the two sisters are (innocent?) victims. There are some good plants that will come back to haunt you at the end. The ski stick is fairly obvious, but no reason initially to ask yourself why the family are veggies. A subtle escalation in the ""tasty meaty morsels"" that tempt Justine (""Sadien"" reference?): sausage, rabbit kidney, finger... And the frontier of broken taboos starts to exceed even what her family and her jaded vet school peers can stomach. Incidentally, don't watch this with a full one!

This is not the first time I'm drawn to French films of this genre, for instance Martyrs and High Tension are only a few I could mention that are definitely worth a watch.Unfortunately Raw doesn't deliver. It tried to be disgusting and I guess it is but shock value doesn't really work if you don't have a decent plot/story-line. During the film it is noticeable it tried to be edgy and over the top but it fails miserably. It's just a bunch of nonsense with an awful soundtrack in the mix. For instance in one scene the sister of the main character (forgot the name) jumps in front of a car, killing the passengers and proceeds to eat them. Luckily no more cars pass by while she was feeding herself and luckily in France the police is nonexistent which explain why she can kill so many people without any suspicion whatsoever.I could go on and on.In conclusion if you like annoying music, young adults trying to be edgy and people biting each other because it's lunch time, then this is for you.",Raw

This is not Hostel or the umpteenth installment of the Saw series or some such nonsense.There is a universally relatable and tragic human story here. Graphic viscera, and the viewer's reaction to it, allow the director to conjure bodily emotions in jaded audiences. Do you remember your first sexual urge? Your first wet dream?

Nothing weird keeps happening as we are introduced to an average vegetarian family dining in a restaurant. It is Justine's last meal with her family before she departs for college. Be careful for clues in the movie, as unpredictable the story might be the clues are still there. When Justine enters her room in college things already aren't going as planned. She has a male roommate which she didn't ask for, and some weird seniors need to ""test"" the new students if they are worthy of going to this school. At first, I had no idea for what this college is. Why so many animals are here and doesn't Justine look way too smart to be here? It turns out like this is a college for vets, and her parents went here too. The actress that plays Justine looks perfect for the role. She's like Robert Downey Jr, I can't imagine anyone else playing Iron Man, and I can't imagine anyone else playing Justine. She reminds me of Ariana Grande a bit, just she looks and acts even more innocent. Makes you ""wonder"" if she will stay that innocent throughout the whole film or will she turn rebellious. The traditions of the college are so off, why do you need to eat a rabbit kidney to just be accepted into the school by other kids? And then something happens and Justine scratches herself. Isn't she supposed to be smart? Don't ever scratch yourself you're only gonna make it worse. I probably am nitpicking but still I can't pass that fact. The first thing that I really disliked in the movie. Justine's sister, sometimes seems a rude but you can see she really cares about Justine and wishes everything the best for her. Some scenes with just two of them are truly genuine and sisterly love after all the tagline of the movie says sisters. Her roommate Adrien is a very attractive boy, but not so smart. When Justine found out who her roommate is she said ""I asked for a female roommate"" but she doesn't need to worry because he's homosexual. The cast is not particularly diverse because it is Belgium, but still there was an Asain student in the bathroom that just looked in the mirror and smiled for 5 seconds. There's a teacher that really dislikes know-it-all students like Justine, a doctor that understands Justine and her parents are not dead like in almost every Disney movie but still they don't have a huge role. I gasped quite a few times while watching the story uncover. The script is so greatly written and has things that I could never imagine happening. Everything I said doesn't even happen after 1-hour mark, the movie has so many things happening and it's just not boring at all. If you are planning on watching Raw which I do recommend just do not eat if you get grossed out easily. There comes a point in the movie where you literally have no idea what the next scene is going to play like or how a scene will end. One part of the movie just started to seem like a beginning to a music video. The film is that weird, and that great.",Raw
203,jeremiebousquet,Unforgettable,9,4 August 2017,"I think there's no point comparing this movie to other movies about cannibalism, because this movie has its own vision and does not try to copy them. It has nothing to do with Hannibal Lecter movies. It has nothing to do with gore either. This movie pictures the development of its main female character, how she awakes to life at the same time she discovers her own secret desires. It doubles with the complex relationship she has with her sister. If there's a comparison, for sure it's with Carry but in reverse. She doesn't discover her specificity because of sexual awakening, it's the contrary, which is a more subversive point of view. But where the ""skill"" of Carry seems likable by nature, the one in this movie is awkward and taboo. In that sense, there's some kind of disturbed message about tolerance : the gay character has no issue, we passed that, no one would be shocked by it, and he has no issue with it. That's not the case at all of course for our vegan, but, she did not choose or decide to be that way either. The movie is also about how any of us have to find our way in life, and how we deal with accidents. In that sense it tests your capacity of empathy. And like real gore or porn, the movie is not afraid of showing everything. This makes it a difficult and memorable watch. Well done.",Raw

The whole movie feels like a set up for something that never came. The accolades that said ""one of the most disturbing films of 2016"" were definitely wrong. It's just a hard one to watch that doesn't bring anything new and offers a flat experience.",Raw

And when Europeans tried, they didn't count on the French... ;-)Appropriately the movie offers great French songs of different genres and when a father asks his daughter if she smokes to subsequently offer her a cigarette you know that this is European cinema.Raw pushes the cannibal genre to a new level. The main character Justine - a natural beauty by the way - is a vegetarian and we are put in fear from the very beginning where this shy girl will be driven by the story and where this might lead to.Raw is not an ultra-brutal splatter movie per se, but is better to be thought of an evil coming-of-age horror story. This movie ends where others of this genre begin, and this worked great. Don't misunderstand me: There are various taboo breaking scenes which are very explicit and range from brutal over nauseating and disgusting up to full perversion. Of course, this wasn't a real French horror movie if it missed to add a kinky erotic component to its message. This makes it even grosser although more in a psychological way. Unsurprisingly, an arty colorful scene must not be missing too.Raw is a sick and disturbing little gem of a horror movie. I don't know where the word vamp comes from neither can I tell anything about the etymology of ""French kiss"", but maybe I get an idea now... ;-)If you can enjoy a character driven approach on the cannibalism theme and don't need a full gore fest this is a must-watch!I recommend a bloody steak with a few drops of ""Vicious Vampire"" extreme hot chili sauce while watching this.

209,beingcynicalsassy,wild and shocking,8,3 October 2017,"""RAW"" is the one of these movies which has left me speechless. An original screenplay makes viewers curious about what the next scene is gonna bring. It is kind of frightening what can people provoke to such unconventional moves like for this movie - cannibalism - when you live a life the others want you to live. Justine - the main character - struggles with herself when she discovers that she is not the person she used to think she is. She can do many horrid things to get her satisfied. This shows that people are also animals and have primitive instincts which sometimes control them and make them do things they would never do. In my opinion the problem is exaggerated, but we must remember that is the horror movie, so it is understood. ""RAW"" is controversial and at the same time unique and intriguing. If you want to watch something fresh and new, you have to hit the cinema and i am sure you will be surprised!",Raw
210,alexpro-34977,A subversive love letter to body horror genre and my favorite horror film of 2016 (maybe even of all time),10,3 March 2021,"The esthetics:
Absolutely beautiful music and cinematography with smooth and precise camera movement reminiscent of Kubrick and Fincher, maybe not as meticulous, but with more variety, utilizing pretty much every cinematic technique, and every time it feels purposeful. The lighting is very pretty, very dramatic and contrasty, and it knows exactly when to be vibrant and colorful and when moody and dark.The story:
The plot is a cannibal coming-of-age story, with a fresh and mature perspective on both teenage drama and cannibal horror, drawing comparisons between craving of raw flesh and sexual desire (which is kind of brilliant since most people can't relate to one, but everyone can relate to the other), and exploring how similar it is in humans and animals. The feelings and relationships of characters feel very real, making them easy to relate to. And by the way, don't think this movie is boring or that it thinks it's too smart to be compared to ""normal"" horror movies. While not focusing on the gore that much and being somewhat subversive, it definitely delivers the goods, wearing it's body horror genre as a badge of honor and directly referencing some horror classics.The violence:
While usually the movie doesn't show you anything that explicitly gory, it clearly establishes that it can show you anything and not hold back, making the sparse violence scenes very effective and tense yet tasteful.The themes:
The visuals are not heavy on symbolism, and the symbolism that is there is not very subtle, with some shots and scenes dedicated entirely to conveying subtext. In my opinion this movie strikes pretty close to the perfect balance of giving you enough to think about and details to pick up on subsequent viewings, while not bogging down the movie and making it boring or incomprehensibleThe criticisms:
While the amount of enjoyment I get from it puts this movie in the 10/10 echelon for me, it is not perfect, and I feel it is only fair to mention the few slight drawbacks that caught my attention: sometimes you can catch slight continuity errors between shots, sometimes the imagery is more concerned with symbolic meaning and looking pretty than making logical sense, and in at least one instance it actually affects the plot, so you could consider it a plot hole, but it wasn't enough to take me out of the movie. Also the clash of gentle strings and heavy sounding electric guitar while representing the clash of drama and horror, feels a bit sudden and obvious, and I wish it was a bit more subtle (you'll get what I mean when you get to the ""finger scene"" song). This last thing is not even fair to call criticism, but I wish there were more Edgar Wright style invisible on the first watch symbolic details hidden in the imagery, unfortunately this movie has very little of those, limiting the rewatch potential.The conclusion:
The body horror genre is not for everyone, so you know if this movie is not for you. Also if all you are interested in is extreme gore that this movie became kind of infamous for, you are likely to be underwhelmed. Otherwise, it is a beautiful, original, smart, stylish horror-drama, that over several viewings became one of my favorite movies of all time, and I definitely recommend it. If you are a movie fan, this is a must watch!",Raw

The feelings and relationships of characters feel very real, making them easy to relate to, with the strongest emotional gut punch delivered right before the end credits.Visuals: Absolutely beautiful cinematography with smooth and precise camera movement and lengthy oners reminiscent of Kubrick and Fincher, maybe not as meticulous, but with more variety, utilizing pretty much every cinematic technique, and every time it feels purposeful. The lighting is very pretty, very dramatic and contrasty, and it knows exactly when to be vibrant and colorful and when moody and dark.Music: I don't feel like I posses the knowledge to analyze music, but let me just say this - I really REALLY like this soundtrack and the way it was used. The score has beautiful instrumentals for drama, it mixes classical orchestral strings and rough industrial sound for horror, and an electronic organ with an out of tune electric guitar bridge the gap. Often the choice of music for the scene is unexpected, but always works very well. All of the music has a loud presence where you can hear every note, and yet it never feels like the soundtrack is telling you how to feel or forcing an emotion that otherwise wouldn't be there, but rather enhances the emotions that are already there.Subtext: The visuals are not heavy on symbolism, and the symbolism that is there is not very subtle, with some shots and scenes dedicated entirely to conveying subtext.

While not focusing on the gore that much and being somewhat subversive, it definitely delivers the goods, wearing it's body horror genre as a badge of honor and directly referencing some horror classics. So if you are a horror fan, this movie may not be exactly what you are used to, but it is clearly made by a horror fan with a ton of respect for the genre.Violence: While usually the movie doesn't show you anything that explicitly gory, it clearly establishes that it can show you anything and not hold back, making the sparse violence scenes tense, brutal, and very effective, but not exploitative - very tasteful. Other than the violence, the movie contains scenes of real medical procedures on animals, and almost certainly real dead animals were used for a dissection scene. I know some people can't stomach things like this, although it is far from the most explicit or disturbing imagery to be shown on TV or in movies, so just keep it in mind if you are considering watching this movie.Criticisms: While the amount of enjoyment I get from it puts this movie in the 10/10 echelon for me, it is not perfect, and I feel it is only fair to mention the few slight drawbacks that caught my attention: sometimes you can catch slight continuity errors between shots, sometimes the imagery is more concerned with symbolic meaning and looking pretty than making logical sense, and in at least one instance it actually affects the plot, so you could consider it a plot hole, but it wasn't enough to take me out of the movie. On the theme of realism, would french vet students really listen to indie rock at their parties?

With Raw, the family drama of the difficult relationship between the protagonist and her sibling serves not as a backdrop to the gore. Rather, it transcends and enhances the grotesque imagery. Well acted from all sides and written with surprising sensitivity and thought, it poses some seriously dark questions about pleasure, basic human need and sexuality, and the rather thin line between them all. That being said... EXPECT GORE.",Raw

I am always on the look for strange, horror movies that just leave me like wtf at the end, and I must say, this one literally made my jaw drop. If you're not into grotesque, weird horror, then you would not be a fan of this movie. It was great all around and the main character had me encapsulated in her life. I only hope that there are more horror movies like this in the future.",Raw
215,giannisst,Arthouse or violence for the shake of violence?,7,6 February 2018,"The fact that's puzzling me about this film is the rather outrageous amount of violence and blood in it (of course this depends on creator's vision). From my perspective, a movie like Raw is closer rather to the arthouse style, rather than gorish and body-horror. I mean, it has things to say, many symbolical elements and allygorical truths, but it is also surrounded by all this blood and gore, making me questioning whether Julia Ducournau actually aimed in a thriller/horror movie with deep meanings and points, or just used violence for the shake of violence. If her goal was the first one (which I actually believe it was), then she could have done without many of it, and the film wouldn't lose it's shocking and splater character. If she aimed to just a body horror/splater film, a film that its main aim would be shocking and making viewers unsettling just for the shake of it and the symbolisms would be the secondary element, then it's a rather good one.
But, as I see it, her goal was the first one, creating a symbolical film that would also leave viewers shocked and unsettled with its rawness. And the film was indeed very interesting, but my problem here is that in all this warren of blood, outrageous cannibalism and body horror, the actual point is lost. The things that will be left in the minds of the audience won't be what the ending meant, or what is the point and the reason, the symbolism behind all this, but the shocking, detailed with all the violence possible, scenes, the way the body parts were cut off.
So, the point I try to make here is that, when speaking about a deeper, artistic, symbolical movie, then maybe the detailed gore and blood might be bad and not the right tool for the job, as it covers the rest and leaves little space for the actual meaning. I don't say that it's not needed, but it should not overthrow the film's actual point and character - something that, from my point of views, happened here.",Raw
216,arnelvin,Decent For a French Film,6,17 February 2018,"Cinematography was decent. Sound design wasn't a strength. Acting was pretty much ok. The film almost always relied on shock factor, although I can say some were competent. Story was pretty straight forward and it works. Not as good as other French movies that also revolve on gore like Baby Blood and Inside. Portrayal of cannibalism felt like it wasn't really realistic at all. Overall, a decent watch for those who seek movies that are different.",Raw
217,dmb-34280,A Unique Coming-of-Age Film,7,18 January 2021,"I just finished watching Raw about 30 minutes ago so you can say it's still ""fresh"" in my head. Expect a few more puns along the way as I ""flesh"" out this quick review.I'll preface this with the fact that I'm a relatively squeamish person. I turn my head away from the tv as quick as I can when I see athletes break bones, for example. So reading/watching non-spoiler reviews of this film beforehand definitely had me a little worried for my emotional well-being during the viewing. I will say though that if you're a fan of horror and are able to stomach an average amount of gore, I think you'll find this more digestible than estimated..Outside of the overhyped gore of the film (something I wasn't looking forward to to begin with), it did well in delivering the coming-of-age premise. I was particularly impressed with Garance Marillier who plays the lead character, Justine. In my opinion, her look was perfectly suited for the character and she did a great job with her descent into cannibalistic desires.My gripes with the film are limited but should be noted nonetheless...SPOILERS-If Justine's sister has become so disengaged with human life to the point of causing car accidents simply to quell her urges, then how did she allow herself to become so ""flesh-drunk"" from the feasting of Justine's roommate? I thought she was supposed to be the veteran cannibal. Also, how many car crashes in that general area does it take to start any form of basic investigation? Lastly, the final scene felt a little corny and out of place for me as a result. It didn't help that I saw it coming from an unfortunate sighting of a YouTube thumbnail that gave it away, but I digress.Overall, I'm glad I saw this. 7/10. Good performances all around including the director and actors. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some snacks to attend to.",Raw

All of the performances are very impressive. The transformation of the protagonist - Justine - from an innocent vegetarian to violent murdering cannibal is spellbinding and perfectly displayed by Marillier. I am excited to see what Ducournau will create next",Raw

The writing was horrible. The acting is horrible. Completely unrealistic film. *spoilers* no version of a medical school, doctor or veterinarian would allow a continued hazing ritual or the continued wear of extremely dirty clothing. No true vegan would allow themselves to eat meat, hazing or not. No gay man would just convert to sleeping with a woman. The goriest part was the main character eating an obvious rubber finger.

Unlike films such as Martyrs (2008) and Love (2015), which are part of the New French Extremity, Raw uses its grotesque gore and sex to not shock the audience but instead encourage the audience to feel sympathy for the main character of 'Justine'. Every cannibalistic desire she gets shows the true animalistic instinct that everyone has behind there human facade. Throughout the film she is constantly having the battle her urges while also dealing with her sister and the everyday temptations of her college, which just so happens to be a veterinary college with some rather extreme hazing rituals.In conclusion, seeing the rise and fall of 'Justine' provides a very entertaining watch while also leaving the audience thinking about college life and how truly alien it really is.",Raw

First off I thought that being a film about a girl who develops a hunger for human flesh that it would be a more horrific and graphic film,not so. Very tame for a film about cannibalism. Secondly the film was very slow in unfolding something that I never appreciate in any horror film.

223,gregmacg,The world would be a better place without this film in it.,1,30 March 2017,"I really hate this film. I hate the fact that it was made, and that now it exists and is in theaters where people like are going to see it, no doubt being left with the feelings of disgust and hopelessness about humanity and the depths of depravity to which we have devolved.The filmmaker, I guess, I'd have to hate as well. What kind of person would choose such a grizzly subject to waste her talent on, when there are so many other more appealing stories to tell? Its from France, written and directed by a talented young woman named  Julia Ducournau. I can't imagine that she really wants to promote the consumption of human flesh as a life style, or to encourage people to jump out in in front of cars on deserted roads to make them veer off the road and crash so that young flesh eating girls can chow down on the brains spattered around the interior. But here it is, this scurrilous, disgusting little film. Doing just that. Making it OK. Putting forth the ultra-liberal ideal that people must be allowed to do what they want to do to find happiness in this world. Fly your freak flag high, flesh eaters of the world! It's not your fault you were made this way.Not only is flesh eating as a lifestyle elevated to be equal to any other sort of proclivity, such as being a veterinarian, licking people's eyeballs, bestiality, public random pointless sex; what is promoted by this film is social and moral anarchy: a complete departure from anything considered moral or purposeful. Of course, having been exposed to the way the latest crop of humans love to over- share, vomiting their dystopian visions onto the marketplace of, I have no doubt that Ducournau would scoff at the very idea that she was promoting the behavior this film is about. And that she was merely making an observation about life. Or even worse, that she just thought it would be funny to treat flesh eating like any other eating disorder, such as anorexia. I get it. Its clever. Which, only makes me hate this film even more.Some films just don't need to be made. Or seen. Some ideas, if you think them up, you need to just forget about them instead of spending a year or two making a movie about them. Because once you do that, then you're obliged to spend the next year trying to sell it and make some money off it so that you can make another movie. None of this justifies the horrible idea and the resultant ""artwork"" in the least. Artwork such as this only hastens the decay of the human condition. We would all be better off if this film had never been made.Even this review I hated spending the time writing, as it prolongs the. Now, I've added to the hype about it. It's been said, ""a bad review is better than no review."" Unfortunately, I'm doing my part to NOT hasten this film off the stage and into the rubbish pile where it belongs. So be it. Go see it, then, if you must. Prepare to be completely appalled. Personally, I had to just go home and sleep a few hours because it depressed me so much. If you don't have a similar reaction to it, then I fear that you have already devolved into the lower state of beingness that this film emanates from, and that is the saddest thing of all.Films like ""Raw"" are made by filmmakers like young Julie just to prove that they can create an effect. OK, you got me there Julie. You created an effect in me, and it was pure, unmitigated disgust. Congratulations.Julie, I urge you to NOT waste the rest of your career and your considerable talents disgusting people. Try making somebody laugh. That's much harder to do.

The actress also was very talented.

239,riccardo-mollo,Great movie with deep meanings,7,8 August 2017,"*** WARNING, THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS ***In my humble opinion, this movie is astonishing. Great photography, great mood and good acting. But I wanna try to go deeper in my analysis...I think in this movie there are two levels of interpretation:The first one, more simple and direct, tells a story about youth problems and cannibalism, with both strong gore and erotic elements (where the one balances the other). These arguments are quite common in this category of movies, as well as the key plot (if we think about it with superficiality).The second one, instead, is much more deeper. It tells a story about parenting failures, and now I explain you why. Since the beginning of the movie, I was upset about seeing a young adult girl strictly forced to eat what her parents told her to eat (only vegetables, in this case). Her parents looked so distant and aloof during all the movie, and that made me think ""WTF! poor girl(s)!"". This feeling got enforced when they left Justine in the parking, ready to leave in a hurry (instead of waiting for Alexia with her), or when they were at the hospital behaving as if nothing bad has ever happened. Furthermore, it feels like they forced their daughters to follow their same course of study (another bad thing that parents should never do). Only at the end, we realize that the parents only tried to protect their daughters from becoming like them, namely cannibal monsters. Unfortunately, they have failed. Only at the end we truly understand why they are so obsessed with the vegetarian diet. That is an odd yet sincere proof of love, as well as another one: when Justine and her dad are having a smoke outside of the hospital, he tells her she'd better not have kids... At first I thought ""How can a father tell such a terrible thing to her little lady?"", but in the end I understood he told so to stop the procreation of new cannibal beings. Furthermore, this movie points out that, as soon as the sons grow up, there is no way for parents to control and to impose what their sons will become in their own life. They should let them be free, even if it may seem painful. This is enforced by the strong bond between the two sisters: even if they always seem to be ready quarrel and fight, in the end they look alone and they love and sustain each other while sharing the same difficult growth path.Cannibalism, sex, violence, strange behaviors, etc... are just metaphorical elements that tell the growth of a young adult and its slow detachment from the family.Great movie!",Raw
240,b_borisha,Veg girl who eats her sisters finger.,6,2 June 2017,"Veg girl who eats her sisters finger. And she enjoys it. Than she get deflowered by her gay roommate. She kind of enjoys it, but finds even more pleasure in biting him and licking his blood.Her 9- finger-sister is well experienced cannibal who is an expert in producing traffic accidents and feasting on the flesh of dead passengers. Of course, that is not all. Something happens along the way and she wakes up in the bed lying beside gay roommate ( I guess that they where in relationship by then) and discovers that her 9finger sisters has eaten him. Everything resolves when her sister is imprisoned and it gets revealed that even their mother is cannibal. Wow!If you think that this is interesting story, go for it. Directing is great, given the fact that this is debut work. Acting, scenography and music is well done as well.My subjective rating is 6. Mainly because of the expectation that i had and the plot.",Raw
241,aravinth-02743,Holly hell,10,18 February 2019,"I usually stay away from films that feature violence with all its gory details but I must admit, this is movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. I believe that a good movie must engage all your senses, and boy did it engage all my senses! Overall this is a bloody masterpiece.",Raw
242,mpsenge,WARNING: literally made me nauseous for days.,1,3 August 2017,"I've never wished I could un-see something more than this film. The images are just so reviling. I've seen my share of grisly violence and eye-opening realism on screen, but some images are just unrealistically disgusting. I kept having to tell myself it was just special effects just to keep my stomach settled. Like another reviewer said, I really wish this movie hadn't been made.",Raw
243,nigeldfell,A long wait,6,18 February 2018,"This made my watchlist last year, I was overall disappointed. It wasn't a gory as i first thought when I read people fainted at the premiere. The end was abrupt, I was however, easily pulled in but this one will easily be forgotten",Raw
244,cassimo-96433,Don't start watching,1,16 October 2018,"If you start watching this movie you have to see it through but it is so bad you'll hate yourself for it. Poorly plotted from the beginning and carried out to the very last line. So little explanation that you're guessing the whole time what appears to be obvious, then, yes, that's really where they went with it all. 
Just don't do it!!",Raw
245,tlevan-19226,"This cut of meat isn't nearly as raw as it believes, nor is it well done.",2,16 October 2017,"Lame meat puns aside, my issue with Raw doesn't stem from the meat and bones of the story (last one I promise), but from the absurdly over the top ""hazing"" of the new students.I was in the Greek system in college, and yes, there are initiations and hazing. We've all heard horror stories of injury or death related cases resulting from hazing. However, the way this was handled in Raw makes it seem like these students are getting their education in hazing, whereas classes and professors are treated as extra-curricular. These scenes are drawn out in what seems to be an attempt at stylistic cinematography, but with no pay off or plot development, it grows to be mundane and repetitive. I really wanted to like Raw, and enjoyed it's bizarre coloring and cinematography. It delivers a few powerful, fleeting moments of a grotesque and terrifying cannibal story trying to find it's legs in a sea of screaming frat-boys and music video montages.",Raw
246,benxslater,Intense and captivating,9,28 September 2017,This movie had me on the edge of my seat unable to even blink at some parts. it draws you in and develops the main character in a way that makes you feel the same feeling she is during the scenes and makes every action believable and understandable. the transformation of the main character through the movie was perfectly paced gradually making you change along side her. this is a good movie but it can be a little intense at parts which makes it hard for some people to watch i was even having a hard time during one of the scenes but it was worth it to experience that kind of intensity. Great movie.,Raw
247,jward-85286,Wholesome coming of age story,1,2 November 2018,"Everyone remembers college, right? This movies is the typical freshman year rom-com, capitalizing on moments such as your first party, meeting new friends, and of course, cannibalism. This ""Catcher in the Rye"" style flick can bring tears to the eyes of all that view. Enjoy!!!!",Raw
248,gangstoe,Disgusting.,1,26 December 2019,"I am sure there are worse movies than this but theese i do not want to see.I must admit i watched just twenty minutes of this crap but that was enough for me,i felt sick in my soul watcing it.I do not want even to explain the story of the movie and i must warn people with a faint heart not to watch it.What kind of sick people makes movies like this?.I do not know much about moviemaking but people who give it ten and saying it is the best movie ever must have a really bad taste and i do not want to ever meet them or the director....ever.Go watch another movie,please.",Raw
249,bobbyv-00610,Crazy!,7,29 December 2018,"Tough movie to watch. The plot lacks internal consistency. It tries to be realistic but the characters' motivations, especially the two sisters, lack believability. Somehow, the director pulls everything together in the final scene, and saves the movie from being an incoherent, disgusting mess. Raw is not for the faint at heart, but it isn't nearly as graphic as I had expected based on other reviews.",Raw
250,tasosdmnd,Twisted,8,6 June 2017,"This movie is so twisted. Classic French production movie that keeps you stunned and thrilled throughout the whole movie. The idea of this kind of movies, as I personally experience it, is not to get all the points straight, not even the idea. The whole scenario may be shocking to you but while watching it you get in the mindset. Having read much about the subject that the film is about, I have to admit that this is just how it should. Not enough American style horror, no extravaganza just as it is raw.",Raw
251,tylerlefevor,An emotional thriller with a powerful message,9,19 March 2017,"Raw is an emotional thriller that utilizes the full gamut of human emotions to make a powerful commentary on the difficulty of navigating emerging adulthood. Ducournau uses a full range of scenarios designed to elicit extreme reactions of disgust—including cannabilism, nonconsensual sex, and a full range of blood and gore—to highlight how repulsive and damaging the betrayal, cattiness, and conflicts common among college students are. Raw focuses on the changing role of sibling relationships, the power of peer relationships, and the effects of parent-induced sexual ""starvation"" on their children. Raw also briefly touches on several of the emotional complexities of emerging adulthood: eating concerns, substance use, and managing teachers' and peers' perceptions. Ducournau masterfully interweaves intensely disgusting emotional scenes with a plot that is just close enough to reality to keep the viewer engaged to produce one of the best films of the year.",Raw
252,kushmaya,Very powerful horror flick great Female leads!!,8,21 June 2017,"This film is not for everyone.. so warning.. the film is graphic and very disturbing, I had to shut my eyes a few times. Great story and killer ending. I think Hollywood needs to take some lessons form this film; the story, how it's told and to make a great third act!! So many Horror flicks fail at that. After watching this film I have a very different take on college hazing in France. Sure yourself and check this out!",Raw
253,usmcmarine,Over-hyped waste of time,2,9 October 2017,"I've been more shocked by taking a day after St Patrick's Day flight. Seriously, at least you get some good stories with the nauseating smells and views. After watching this film you are left with the same feeling you have after listening to the excuses of a person who purposefully drives over a family of ducks or a possum crossing the road; the explanation doesn't make sense, you're pretty sure that there's a hidden mental dis involved with person giving you the story line, and it seems more like a cry for attention using the worst methodology. The movie is rather boring and the most shocking thing about it is that it got so many good reviews. There's no stunning scenery, or captivating or deep story-line; you pretty much could watch a poultry factory beheading line for an hour and get the same entertainment value.",Raw
254,mattiusconybeer,Yea it's pretty good,8,25 March 2018,"This movie is pretty good, pretty scary, makes me want to eat some chicken. 8/10",Raw

256,jellybellybean-25891,traumatic experience.,8,5 September 2020,This movie is absolutely disturbing.I was able to watch Hannibal and other movies about cannibalism but this one is just almost traumatic to watch.,Raw
257,jpwbucks,Grizzly and horriffic,8,25 December 2018,Watching this movie I was completely stunned.. if the main purpose of this movie was to make you feel uneasy throughout the whole thing then it succeeded. The ending with the father was absolutely disgusting but holy s*** made a great ending. Two thumbs up great movie.,Raw
