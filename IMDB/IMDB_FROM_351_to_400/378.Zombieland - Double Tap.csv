0,MartinHafer,About as good as the first.,8,25 April 2020,"The ""Zombieland"" films are definitely NOT movies for film snobs. They are mindless fun and violence...and this is NOT a complaint. As a tiny bit of a film snob myself, I do sometimes love seeing something this mindless....and it keeps me from becoming too pretentious. I strongly recommend this second one...because it's much of what you got in the first one and about as good.Unlike some sequels, this one, fortunately, was able to bring back the old cast. Now, ten years later, the group faces two problems....the group starts to dissolve into individuals and there is a new threat....worse, stronger and smarter zombies. Can they all manage to get back together and work together to defeat this new batch of baddies?By the way, if you do see this film, a couple things you need to know. First, it's very, very, very violent. Yes, at times it's almost cartoonish violence, but it has a lot of blood, guts and yecch! Second, do NOT turn the movie off before the credits roll...please watch all the credits. You'll see why.",Zombieland - Double Tap
1,Leofwine_draca,Same as the first,2,8 October 2020,"DOUBLE TAP is a ten-years-later sequel to ZOMBIELAND. I hated the first film and this follow-up, which offers more of exactly the same, is similarly routine and unenterprising. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson are back in another road trip tale involving kooky assorted characters and random zombie action, but it's a typical slacker comedy and typically unfunny as a result. The stars try hard with irreverent one-liners and comic interplay, but the jokes fall flat time and again and none of the situations along the way are any good either. When the best part is a mid-credits joke sequence with a cameoing Bill Murray you know your film's in trouble.",Zombieland - Double Tap
2,SnoopyStyle,great fun like the first,8,25 December 2019,"It's been a few years. The gang decides to set up camp at the White House. Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) is tired of Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson)'s fatherly advices. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) proposes to Wichita (Emma Stone) which only drives her away. The sisters leave and Little Rock finds pacifist Berkeley (Avan Jogia), a boy at her own age. Columbus finds clueless Madison (Zoey Deutch) who had been hiding in a freezer at the mall. Little Rock runs off with Berkeley and Wichita goes in pursuit joined by the boys and Madison. Tallahassee encounters fellow Elvis fanatic Nevada (Rosario Dawson) and doppelganger Albuquerque (Luke Wilson). Columbus has his own doppelganger Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch).The original is irreverent fun. This one has the gang returning along with some very funny new side characters. This might have a few more laughs than the first one. I really like Madison and I wish she stayed with the group from start to finish. She's great at needling Wichita and the Uber bit is hilarious. The funniest bit has to be the introduction of Albuquerque and Flagstaff and I laughed hard. I would do some different things with the ending but I do like the Buffalo Jump. Overall, this is a great sequel which is just as much fun if not more than the original.",Zombieland - Double Tap
3,claudio_carvalho,Silly and Funny,6,26 December 2019,"Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) move to the White House. When Columbus proposes to get married with his girlfriend Wichita, she and her sister hijack Tallahassee's car ""The Beast"" and she leaves a farewell note to Columbus. One month later, Tallahassee and Columbus meet the dumb blonde Madison (Zoey Deutch), who survived in a refrigeration chamber, in a mall and Columbus brings the Bimbo to the White House and has sex with her. But soon Wichita returns and explains that Little Rock and the pothead hitchhiker Berkeley (Avan Jogia) have stolen The Beast to go to Graceland first and then to Babylon, a commune of pacifists that live in the ""peace and love"" of the 70's. Now Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Madison decide to go on the road again to rescue Little Rock.""Zombieland: Double Tap"" is a silly and funny sequel of the first Zombieland. Zoey Deutch is excellent of the stereotypic role of a dumb blonde and is responsible for many laughs. See this film with low expectation and you may be surprised with the adventures of Tallahassee and his friends. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Zumbilândia: Atire Duas Vezes"" (""Zombieland: Double Tap"")",Zombieland - Double Tap
4,nogodnomasters,"If you love something, you shoot it in the face",9,20 October 2019,We start out years later as our foursome make it the White House. Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone are together while Abigail Breslin wants a boyfriend. The zombies have evolved and the action moves to Graceland. The film has all of the regulars (Bill Murray in a flashback) and addition cast was great especially Zoey Deutch who stole all the scenes she was in as a near mindless individual.They make references to events in the first film as if you have seen it.Great mindless fun. I even caught the Steinbeck reference.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity,Zombieland - Double Tap
5,kosmasp,It takes time,9,15 March 2020,"Just the beginning intro and what they did to the Columbia lady ... is worth watching this! And when you get hyped right from the start, this is a good sign. The signs of the zombie apocalypse may not be good, but the fun you can have with this one are quite something. And while we get our remaining/surviving character from the first movie, we also get some very cool new characters!They may seem annoying at times, but that's why they are also very funny. I was also annoyed by Bill Murrays character/fate/stupid decision that was not funny at all, in the first movie ... so I get it, if you feel the same about characters in this one. I think it worked here though, give it a shot - oops. Well you know what I mean. If you liked the first one, you hopefully will appreciate the time they took to get it right",Zombieland - Double Tap
6,classicsoncall,"""Back for seconds? After all this time?""",7,20 October 2020,"This is another fun outing from the original ""Zombieland"" crew, reuniting all four principals from the first movie and adding a couple of ancillary characters. I'm not particularly a fan of zombie flicks, some take themselves way too seriously. But I do enjoy spoofy, absurd humor and this one has it in spades. The film takes a minor detour to Graceland paying homage to the memory of Elvis Presley, and as an Elvis imitator, Woody Harrelson isn't too bad when he doesn't have to sing. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) takes a minor detour in the romance department as well, before finally sealing the deal with girlfriend and fellow traveler Wichita (Emma Stone). Zombieland newcomer Zoey Deutch plays the part of a clueless Valley Girl to perfection, even if she does hail from Madison. Searching for that perfect Zombie Kill of the Year, Tallahassee (Harrelson) and company find their big blowout at Babylon's Great American Zombie Jump. If you join in, prepare for an absurd amount of gore and squishy body parts, topped off by an out of the blue gratuitous appearance by Bill Murray both before and after the closing credits. While you're at it, get ready for a reworking of the 'rules for zombies', with a totally New Rule #1. Sorry, you'll have to watch the picture to catch it.",Zombieland - Double Tap
7,Tweekums,"Fun, if unrequired, zombie sequel",7,11 September 2021,"These comments are based on the assumption that people will have seen the first film so won't need introductions to the characters and their situation.Ten years have passed and Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock have found a safe home... in the White House. Things soon change though; they may be safe from zombies but Wichita and Little Rock decide to leave. Wichita does return but not till Columbus has met another girl; the dim-witted Madison. Wichita is concerned because her sister has headed to Graceland with a hippy named Berkley. It is time to hit the road again to find her. Along the way they encounter plenty of zombies, of which there are now several different varieties.The original 'Zombieland' was a fun little film that didn't really need a sequel. That said this proved to be pretty enjoyable too. It never takes itself seriously and there are plenty of laughs, lots of often hilarious zombie killing and even some mild scares. The returning cast are all solid and there are some fun additions, most obviously Zoey Deutch as the less than bright Madison. I liked how the zombies have evolved into a variety of new types; the names they are given were pretty good too. There are some enjoyable running gags, such as their difficulty getting decent transport, and fun references to events in the first film. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the original even if this isn't quite as good.",Zombieland - Double Tap
8,BA_Harrison,"Slightly better than the trailer suggested, but not as good as the original.",6,19 October 2019,"I'm a big fan of the first Zombieland movie: I dig the humour and love the characters, the excellent cast displaying great chemistry. However, something about the trailer for Double Tap made me fear the worst for this belated sequel: the comedy seemed forced and there was a distinct lack of zombie action. Would the magic still be there after a decade?The answer is 'yes'. And 'no'.It starts in fine style, with our four protagonists -- Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) -- killing zombies in gory fashion to Metallica's 'Master of Puppets', immediately allaying any fears I had about this being light on the splatter. The comedy seemed on point too, but things soon start to get a bit wobbly when the dynamic of the group suddenly changes: Wichita and Little Rock up and leave, and meet hippy Berkeley (Avan Jogia) on the road. Little Rock then abandons her sister, running off with Berkeley. Not much fun to be had here, since Berkeley is such an irritating character.Meanwhile, Columbus meets a bubble-headed blonde, Madison (Zoey Deutch), and is only too happy to satisfy her carnal needs. Fortunately, Deutch is a revelation, her ditzy bimbo routine lots of fun. When Wichita returns, she's none too happy to see that Columbus has a new squeeze, but teams up with the guys (and gal) regardless to find her missing sister, who has headed for Graceland.The following journey leads to an exciting altercation with some super-zombies (dubbed T-800s), a meeting with sexy, sassy Elvis fan Nevada (Rosario Dawson), and a clash of personalities with Tallahassee and Columbus doppelgangers Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch), which for me was the weakest part of the film (it didn't make me laugh in the trailer, and it didn't make me laugh in the film).Fortunately, the film picks up for an exciting finale at hippie commune Babylon, where our heroes must do battle with a horde of ravenous T-800s, the crazy carnage involving a monster truck and a dangerous plan that takes place at the top of a high-rise building.All told, Double Tap is quite a mixed bag of stuff that works and bits that don't. Not essential viewing, but just about worth a watch for fans of the original.5.5/10, rounded up to 6 for IMDb.",Zombieland - Double Tap
9,paul_haakonsen,This was a rather mundane sequel...,5,17 December 2019,"""Zombieland: Double Tap"", while it being a zombie, wasn't really one that was just screaming for me to rush out to the cinema to watch. But still, I got a chance to watch it and sat down to do so. After all the 2013 ""Zombieland"" movie was good and this is a zombie movie after all.I will say that ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" is entertaining, but it wasn't a movie that was just overly outstanding. It is fun to watch, but as a sequel, then it was fairly mundane.It was good to see the characters again and have the cast return to reprise their roles, for sure. And the movie does have some new good performers on the cast list as well, such as the likes of Zoey Deutch, Rosario Dawson and Luke Wilson.The movie is definitely surviving a great deal on the many pop culture references and comedic jabs it throws at these. This was quite something that I enjoyed. However, this being a zombie movie, then I was disappointed to see how little a part of the movie that the zombies actually had. The zombies were a mere backdrop in the movie, serving little or no purpose, and had surprisingly little appearances in the movie. Sure, the scenes with the zombies were phenomenally nice to watch, both visually and also with the over-the-top presentation it had. But for a movie titled ""Zombieland"", then you need more zombies and have them play a more focal part of the storyline.Essentially, this was a road movie with a hint of coming-of-age seasoning. Not really what I was expecting or hoping to see. All in all, not a particularly outstanding movie, and hardly one that I will actually sit down to watch a second time. This movie was not as good as the predecessor.I am rating ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" a mediocre five out of ten stars.",Zombieland - Double Tap
10,zardoz-13,"Twice the Body Count of ""Zombieland""",8,28 October 2019,"What ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" (*** OUT OF ****) lacks in originality, ""Venom"" director Ruben Fleischer and writers Dave Callaham of ""Expendables 3,"" along with Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick of ""Deadpool,"" more than compensate for with gratuitous gusto and sardonic hilarity. Mind you, ten years and one canceled 2013 pilot for a ""Zombieland"" television series later, Fleischer is back at the helm with returning scribes Reese and Wernick. Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin reprise their roles respectively as Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita, and Little Rock from the 2009 original. Basically, things haven't changed that much during the intervening decade. Columbus still provides his witty voice-over narration and enumerates those changes since their last shenanigans. First, new strains of zombies are on the warpath, and Columbus describes them as T-800s (a homage to ""Terminators"" movies) because they are difficult to put down. Furthermore, three additional varieties are lurking out there in the apocalypse. Stupid zombies--referred to as Homers--chase butterflies and assault concrete statues. Some zombies have acquired partial smarts. For example, a zombie in a research lab pursues a doctor to an elevator. The zombie cannot access the elevator because the retinal scan doesn't recognize it. Plucking an eyeball from a dead physician nearby, this contemplative zombie pulls a Wesley Snipes' stunt from ""Demolition Man"" (1993). Now, the scanner recognizes the dead physician's eyeball in the zombie's mouth. The elevator door opens, and the zombie munches the doctor! Lastly, 'ninja' zombies have evolved. Catching their prey off-guard, these nimble flesh eaters strike silently. You don't know you've been bitten until you hear yourself scream. Second, Columbus has gotten more adept with firearms. Tallahassee no longer craves Twinkies, but he has become a die-hard Elvis fanatic. Little Rock changes the most. She has given her sister the slip and absconded with a hippie guitarist. Predictably, Wichita sets out to find her.
Like the original ""Zombieland,"" ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" is a road trip through Hades. Our heroes and heroines are almost as bloodthirsty as the ravenous undead. After ten years, Tallahassee, Columbus, and Wichita have gotten their act coordinated well enough to repulse hordes of zombies and blast these damned devils to smithereens. Growling and snarling with menace, these wretched souls charge them, and our trio take them down like tenpins. Nerdy Columbus has gotten really handy with a pump-action shotgun, and Tallahassee revels in the carnage. One of the reasons Little Rock parted company was she wanted to live her own life without restrictions, especially from Tallahassee. Initially, when ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" opens, the quartet are hanging out at the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. They live without a care about what's occurring outside until Wichita embarks on her search for Little Rock. Before she departed, Tallahassee gave Little Rock the gift of a chrome-plated .45 caliber Colt pistol. However, this was no ordinary automatic, but the gun that Elvis Presley gave to President Richard Nixon. As annoyed as Little Rock became about Tallahassee hovering over her like a surrogate father, she accepts the firearm.Like the original, Tallahassee and Columbus realize they've been left high and dry when Wichita hightails it to find her sister. In this instance, Little Rock has given Wichita the slip. Meantime, when the guys visit a mall near the White House, they stumble across one human who survived the zombie apocalypse. Columbus encounters Madison (Zoey Deutch of ""Vampire Academy""), who has been hiding in a freezer at the mall. Decked out in pastel pink, this sex-starved, scatterbrained blonde babe embraces her inner bimbo with unbridled abandon. Columbus and she have an affair in progress when Wichita returns after having broken up earlier with Columbus. Wichita left Columbus because he refused to put sticky notes on the eyes of Abraham Lincoln's portrait in the Lincoln Room of the White House while they made love. Now, Wichita is jealous. Since they have left the White House, Tallahassee decides to follow Little Rock to Elvis Presley's mansion in Graceland. Accordingly, Tallahassee is shattered when they cruise up to the dark, abandoned dwelling. Careening off into the distance, they wind up spending the night at The Hound Dog Hotel. Another Elvis enthusiast, Nevada (the curvaceous Rosario Dawson of ""Sin City""), owns this place. How this lady has survived alone in the wilderness of Tennessee is a mystery never adequately explained.One day, Nevada's two friends, Albuquerque (a Stetson clad Luke Wilson of ""Idiocracy"") and his sidekick Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch of ""Replicas"") arrive in a monster truck to warn her about those tenacious T-800s. Some of those undead dastards storm the Hound Dog, and our heroes and heroines tangle with them. Director Reuben Fleischer has field day depicting zombies getting their heads obliterated as our heroes wield their hardware with devastating accuracy. Afterward, they learn about the Babylon commune, where people have gone to live in peace and harmony. These hippie types have fortified a high-rise, tower-shaped motel. Moreover, they have melted down their firearms and have deluded themselves into believing that the zombies won't bother them. The grand finale transpires in this resort setting with Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita, and Madison tracking down Little Rock and her stoner boyfriend (Avan Jogia of ""Shaft"") nicknamed Berkeley who have sought refuge in Babylon.Basically, if you've seen zombie movie, you've seen them all. Director George A. Romeo reinvented the genre with ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968), and Edgar Wright's ""Shaun of the Dead"" (2004) added laughs to the nihilist formula. Clearly, the success of ""The Walking Dead"" (2010) television series has also influenced even Fleischer's film with its finale in a commune. The camaraderie of our heroes and heroines keeps ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" fresh and captivating after ten years, and that's saying a lot for this gory horror comedy with its double-digit zombie casualty list. Oh, yes, don't skip out on Bill Murray's scene-stealing end credits cameo during the publicity tour of ""Garfield 3"" when he imitates a cat coughing up a hairball!",Zombieland - Double Tap
11,grantss,Funny and fun: a worthy sequel to the first Zombieland,8,30 May 2020,"Ten years after the events of the first Zombieland movie, our heroes - Tallahassee, Wichita, Columbus and Little Rock - are enjoying life in the White House. Then, all of a sudden, Wichita and Little Rock leave. Wichita eventually returns but Little Rock is charting her own course. Tallahassee, Wichita and Columbus set out to find her, accompanied by Columbus's new girlfriend, of sorts, Madison.The first Zombieland, released in 2009, was great. The plot was a bit random (though its rambling nature had a certain charm) but it was the dialogue that made it so good: very funny and delivered perfectly. Some other great comedic devices rounded off a very funny movie.Zombieland: Double Tap follows in these footsteps with some great lines and comedic moments. Woody Harrelson (as Tallahassee), Emma Stone (Wichita), Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) and Abigail Breslin (Little Rock) are in fine form again. Zoey Deutch is great as the beautiful but dim-witted Madison.The film does struggle a bit towards the end though. For 80% of its duration it was a great comedy with very little ambition to be a serious zombie-drama but towards the end it starts to take itself too seriously. What follows is a fairly conventional and flat period of action-drama. Almost made me knock the film down to a 7. Stuck with the 8, but a weak 8.",Zombieland - Double Tap
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Welcome back,8,27 October 2019,"It's been 10 years without much changing. The sisters leave because they feel trapped in their situation. One month later, Wichita(Stone, impeccable) returns to tell the guys that Little Rock(Breslin, the only of the four main cast to return who doesn't get that much funny stuff to do) left her for a hippie, something all three of them find to be a problem. Can he protect her when he's taken a vow of nonviolence? Tallahassee(Harrelson, his desire for a Twinkie replaced with an obsession with Elvis that is a lot easier to milk, and they do, and it is glorious) in particular hates the idea of his adoptive daughter, clearly still 12 years old in his mind, being with someone he considers not right for her. So they leave to catch up to her. Thing is, Columbus(Eisenberg, ever OCD), in the time spent away from the girls, got together with Madison(Deutch, stealing the show. They keep coming up with new material for her, which makes her remain a laugh riot for much longer than you might otherwise expect. All of her screen-time, in fact), who's... let's go with ""not exactly the smartest"". They can't just leave her behind... well, despite a 2-to-1 vote in favor of that, they don't. So we get a lot of great bickering between the two now bitter exes, something both actors nail, while the blonde in the middle doesn't realize it's going on at all.Like Ant-Man and The Wasp and Deadpool 2 before it, clearly they watched the first movie repeatedly, figured out what worked the best and how to reference everything people loved about the original. This is hilarious from start to finish. This came out a decade after what it's a sequel to, and not everyone will find it to live up to that long wait. It doesn't try to be a carbon copy, or take huge risks so as not to alienate core fans waited for so long, but focuses on interpersonal relationships, which I would say was the right way to go. It's scarier, the jokes are more plentiful, it has more action and the character moments ring true.I recommend this those who have wanted this since 2009, as long as you can accept that it's not going to live up to having been wished for, for so long. 8/10",Zombieland - Double Tap
13,view_and_review,Never as Good as the First Time,6,20 October 2019,"I think it was Sadé who sang, ""it's never as good as the first time."" That was my overall sentiment after watching Z'land: Double Tap.The first Zombieland was so novel, fresh, and new that I loved it in spite of not being an Emma Stone fan. In this edition everyone is ten years older and they're in the same scenario being the same types of characters. Whereas Woody Harrelson's character can be the same after ten years (surly, shoot 'em up, cowboy), Eisenberg's character is annoying after ten years. He's pushing 40 and he's the same chatty, finicky, borderline wuss. He failed to draw a laugh and his character isn't as cool ten years into a zombie apocalypse.With a movie as good as the first Zombieland, what could they do for encore? Well, much like TWD did, they added relationship drama. Ugh. When zombies aren't excitement and drama enough why not throw in there a petulant teen that wants to fly the coop and a long standing couple that are in the fighting stage that now need something to remind them that they love each other. We got that and two highly annoying additions.Madison (Zoey Deutch) and Berkeley (Avan Jogia).Madison was a blond. That's all that needs to be said. Berkeley was from Berkeley. That's all that needs to be said. They were both the stereotypical representations of blonds and Berkelians respectively. And they both got way too much screen time. They were characters which are great as comic relief in a small dose, but nothing worthy of significant screen time. They got significant screen time.Z'land: DT had its moments but I just wasn't feeling it. I thought it was going to be great because of its predecessor and well... it's never as good as the first time.",Zombieland - Double Tap
14,neil-476,An utter hoot,9,20 October 2019,"Our four haphazard and somewhat foul-mouthed friends - mouthy Tallahassee, nerdy and uber-careful Columbus, cute but wilful Wichita and kid sister Little Rock - are living in zombie-free near-harmony in the White House. But 10 years have passed and Little Rock, no longer little, fancies some company of her own age (subtext: male company) so the two girls head out on their own. The men follow once Columbus has finished some serious moping (he had proposed to Wichita theprevious evening), but only get as far as picking up the gorgeous but empty-headed Madison before returning to the White House. Wichita arrives back - nose out of joing at the speed of Columbus' rebound - and the group of four set off in pursuit of Little Rock and the cheesy pacifist singer/songwriter she has taken up with.Much as I really like the original four, the new characters introduced here, particularly the hilariously dim Madison and the strangely familiar Albuquerque and Flagstaff, add hugely enjoyable additional dynamics to the interpersonal relationsips. The device of posting graphics of Columbus' rules is continued, but with a couple of wrinkles, and is as funny and effective as before.It is hugely violent, it is full of swearing, and it is very, very funny.

It doesn't go anywhere interesting at all, the hell?The original's a popcorn flick, but decent. This is just more of the same, without any character development. It's too damn self-aware and Jesse Eisenberg's just bloody annoying. The Luke Wilson, Thomas Middleditch and Rosario Dawson part's just crap.",Zombieland - Double Tap
16,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Stellar follow-up that only features minor detrimental issues,9,19 January 2020,"After moving on with their lives, the group of friends decides to get back together and head out into the zombie-filled world they left behind to save them, meeting not just other survivors to adapt to their family but a deadlier strain of zombie that endangers everyone around them.This was a solid and serviceable follow-up. The film's at it's best with the continued storyline of the characters once again as they continue to survive. That this goes into the various individuals in the group and gives each one their storyline to help show their growth and evolution over time that just so happens to take place during a zombie apocalypse makes for a fun time here. From the proxy-father figure teaching the kids how to grow up and make their lot in life to realizing the need for independence and leaving the nest to a surrogate marriage and how to deal with someone new that might disrupt their relationship, these are all given plenty of time to play out within the context of continuous zombie ambushes that are woven into the film which also forces along their relationships in a great, interconnected puzzle. That these are fun and enjoyable while getting the characters plenty to like about each other is what makes these so much fun. That also goes hand-in-hand with some decent zombie encounters. The hard-hitting opening that shows the group blasting through the zombies in their march to the White House gets this started on a perfect note as everyone gets to shine blasting them in the face with high-tech weaponry. Along the way, scenes like the battle in the mall where they pick up the other survivor, the caravan finding the zombies at the parked tour-bus or the missing sister finding the running zombies along the way get this one going with a solid series of action scenes out on the road. As well, the fantastic confrontation at the motel is impressively choreographed and incredibly fun, keeping this one moving along at a great clip with the road-movie aesthetic keeping this moving to new locations to battle the zombies before getting to the high-quality finale which is the confrontation at the sanctuary against the enhanced zombies featuring tons of action and lots of fun gore. With the comedy still quite funny and quite appropriate for the tone of the film here, there's a lot of positive aspects at work here. There are a few issues with this one. The biggest problem here is the randomness of the inserts to try to be meta in how this approaches the time they've been together. Making up names for the zombies based on pop-culture celebrities, doing random insert shots of people around the world attempting to pull off incredibly elaborate, convoluted, over-the-top and impossible-to-pull-off in any realistic sense type of kills on zombies come off trying to be quite hip and fresh. However, these end up disrupting the flow of the main storyline involving the group going out for their friend by doing these cutaways and inserts to people around the world in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. As well, the main reliance on setting up the romance angle for everyone makes for a pretty suspenseless time because everyone is bound to end up with a partner, rendering their encounters meaningless due to keeping the relationships intact. However, these here aren't detrimental and don't hold it back much.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Zombieland - Double Tap
17,siderite,"The first was boring, the sequel was slightly better",6,19 January 2020,"As with the first part from *ten years ago*, this is a mix of people being awkward for comedy, zombies running around like headless chickens and the suspense only romantic comedies can generate, plus some cameos.

18,thesar-2,Double the Fun,7,22 August 2020,"Well, this is rare, though not unheard of: A Sequel WAY better than its original.Haven't seen the original Zombieland in over 10 years and all I remember of it was that I gave it 3/5 stars and while I liked it, I HATED the girls. This is NOT normal for me. In fact, I love badass women in cinema, probably 10x more then the men. Just not here. I HAAAAATED these girls and if the worst decisions that could be made, especially in a Zombie apocalypse, everyone made them in the first movie.Here, somehow, I've forgiven the girls, aside from the obnoxious new one, and thought this was actually funnier than the first one. All bad decisions, still made, though.In real-time, it's 10 years post the first film and our four survivors are living in luxury within the White House when the youngest runs off with a hippie. The remaining trinity race after her only to be attacked by (sadly) evolving zombies.Thank Goodness the rest of the movie isn't as fake, though never perfect, but the opening was SOOO bad CGI, I was mildly tempted to turn this off. I HATE CGI blood, but this took it 10 steps worse than just the computer-generated blood.Mercifully, it gets much better and I loved the humor more this time around. While never bad in the original, I found myself laughing more this time than last. And it was nice the leading females weren't such horrible human beings this time around.I would recommend both, back-to-back and thankfully, you'll end on a higher note.***Final thoughts: Thank you, Living Legend Ghostbuster.

21,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"It's decent enough but it's too little, too late.",6,20 October 2019,"'Zombieland: Double Tap (2019)' about as good as the first flick, which is to say it's fine. I mean, it's good enough but it's certainly nothing special in the grand scheme of things. It plays in segments, as a series of connected but distinct skits, and it follows a very basic narrative structure. It has simplistic character arcs and a predictable escalation, leading to a relatively luke-warm vibe. However, even though I don't think it's particularly funny, it does have a strange charm to it. It's relatively enjoyable throughout and certainly isn't ever boring. Plus, for as basic as they are, the character arcs are appreciated, adding some weight to the otherwise weightless proceedings. The characters themselves are as compelling as they've ever been, brought to life with charismatic performances that elevate the usually mediocre writing. The piece does have a slightly outdated 'anti-pacifist' message, with the 'hippies' of Babylon being closer to something from the sixties than anything resembling modern-day 'hipsters'. This isn't a huge issue, though, mainly because it's rather subtextual and actually feels, almost, accidental. The generally irreverent tone keeps things afloat and the affair is quite fun, despite several jokes - which are often extended - being less-than-inspired, shall we say. The world is made a bit more dangerous with the introduction of 'zombie evolution'; some scenes actually approach tension. There's also an extended fight which feels fresh and is probably the thing's highlight. On the whole, though, the movie is very similar to its predecessor - like, almost identical in some ways. Because of this, the belated sequel feels a bit unnecessary, more of the same rather than a revelatory change. It's a satisfactory follow-up, but it's almost too little, too late. 6/10",Zombieland - Double Tap
22,bowmanblue,"Forced, but not that bad",7,30 January 2021,"Despite my love of all things 'zombie-related,' for some reason I never really 'got' the original 'Zombieland.' I thought it was okay, but, based on other people's opinions, everyone else seemed to love it while it just felt a bit run-of-the-mill to me. This sequel comes quite late in terms of capitalising off the original's success - a sign that it may not be up to scratch.Sure enough, it took a mauling from critics and kind of sank without a trace. Having watched it now, I can sort of see where the critics were coming from. The word I'd use to describe it is 'forced.' The first film ended and didn't really have much room to go in terms of carrying on the story. The four heroes of the first outing all return (rare for a horror movie!) and have decent enough chemistry as we find what's happened to them in this post apocalyptic undead-filled dystopia. There are jokes between them and most actually land. Yet the whole story seems to be based on one plot device after the other to set them up from their happy/safe beginnings and move them into danger.Characters split up. You know they're going to be back together by the end of the film. They are forced to move locations, leaving safety for more dangerous parts of America, simply because the story needs them to. And the zombies themselves have been 'beefed up.' The problem is, when you have expert zombie-killers as the main characters, then the undead are not particularly threatening. Trouble is, the 'souped-up' ghouls are little more intimidating than any that came before them.A new character, played by Zoey Deutch, was introduced. At first I thought she was quite annoying (at least she was supposed to be), but, by then end of the film, I realised that she had most of the best/funniest lines and I possibly wanted to see more of her!The zombie genre was popular in the seventies and eighties, but got done to death. However, when the 'Resident Evil' movies of the early 2000s brought the genre back from the grave we were given practically every type of zombie movie and spin-off we could ever want. 'Zombieland: Doubletap' is a horror/comedy with the emphasis firmly on laughs. There's not much gore here that you haven't seen before, but there's also not much you haven't seen before full stop. It's okay and an easy enough film to have on in the background, but you'd probably feel a bit cheated if you paid full price at the cinema for it.",Zombieland - Double Tap

24,Cineanalyst,Doubly Amusing,5,8 February 2020,"The sequel to ""Zombieland"" (2009), ""Double Tap"" benefits from a lack of cumbersome backstory and largely needless establishing of characters who are mere walking-and-talking tropes and the nauseating sap of those characters boohooing over their families being dead, along with most of the rest of humanity, that bogged down its predecessor. Even the initial plot catalyst of the younger sister wanting her own boyfriend receives a light treatment and ironic ending with her hooking up with pacifist poser ""Berkeley."" The sequel gets right to the meat of the matter of dumb jokes and the gaudy action of killing zombies. Moreover, the filmmakers, including the writers from the ""Deadpool"" series, exploit a fundamental ""rule,"" if you will, or ""commandment,"" of sequels, which is to double everything. Heck, it's in the title. It's the very essence of sequels and filmmaking itself--of reproducing an original. Whereas the first movie referenced ""Ghostbusters"" (1984), this one repeatedly mentions ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" (1991) and conjures the prospect of a trilogy in the mid-credits scene. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg's characters meet their doppelgängers in another sequence, which also recalls zombies as the deathly dual form of people. Eisenberg's also has two girlfriends this time. Even Elvis is a decent connection to replace ""Ghostbusters,"" with Harrelson dressing as an impersonator and what with the conspiracy theories of the King's survival after death--if you will, his being undead.Doubling was a predominant theme in one of Hollywood's first great sequels, which it happens was also a humorous horror film, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935). Ergo, two mad doctors--the second madder than the first, two brides of Frankenstein, two monsters, and two narratives, along with a dual focus in the main one. In the silent era, too, stars Douglas Fairbanks and Rudolph Valentino played dual roles in sequels to their popular films, that is ""Don Q, Son of Zorro"" (1925) and ""The Son of the Sheik"" (1926), respectively. In other words, this is a well established feature of filmic follow-ups, as much so as their tendency to transverse new ground and introduce new characters, like that of Zoey Dutch's Madison here, who despite playing a dumb blonde stereotype, steals the show.The comedy here isn't sophisticated, but there are a few moments that I found particularly delightful. It answered for some of the unrealistic elements in the original that I and others cited. Electricity is accounted for by rain keeping dams working, which may be ridiculous in reality, but, hey, at least there's an internal-movie-land logic to the lights staying on offered for Zombieland now. The availability of working automobiles and the conservation of bullets are also addressed.Perhaps, best of all, however, is the series' continued, obstinate refusal to admit a sound real-world allegory for the zombies, which goes against the usual reading of zombie movies since their popularizing by George A. Romero and somewhat distinguishes ""Double Tap"" from another zombie comedy from 2019, ""The Dead Don't Die"" (and I have yet to see yet another such picture from the same year, ""Little Monsters""). It doubles down on the seemingly-pointless invoking of Native Americans--the vandalizing of the shop in the first one and the ""blood"" relation of Harrelson's character this outing. Forgive me or not, but I was reminded of U.S. Senator and current presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren and her controversy regarding supposed Native-American ancestry, because, after all, Harrelson's character and company occupy the abandoned White House for a time in this one, too, with him even declaring himself POTUS. On the other hand, Harrelson is clearly playing a gun-loving, redneck type. Eventually, the picture goes so far as to demolish a hippie commune with a monster-truck derby. Is this a critique on the perseverance or deconstruction of cultural and political divisions in America with zombies released in time for an especially polarized real-world nation facing election season? Meh, probably best not to think too much about it. The filmmakers evidently didn't.",Zombieland - Double Tap

I liked the first film more, but that was more then a decade ago when zombie genre was hot. Today, it isn't anymore - we have seen it all, and Zombieland: Double Tap doesn't bring anything new, fresh or original to the table. But what this movie has great in it are the actors. They are great! Any single of the 3 can easily carry a movie on their own, and they have a great chemistry.

28,The-Sarkologist,A delightful Sequal that meets expectations,8,24 October 2019,"Well, now that I had seen the first one, and really enjoyed it, it was time to head down to the cinema to watch the sequel. Mind you, for most people that would have been 10 or so years, but for me, it was only a couple of days. It was funny though because it wasn't until I watched the original that the trailer for the sequel actually started making sense - before that, it just seemed like it was some silly, try-hard, comedy.Silly try-hard comedy it certainly wasn't, if my loud guffaws were anything to go by. Okay, I won't necessarily say that I was laughing too hard, or too long, but this film certainly did get a few laughs out of me, which can be pretty difficult to do these days, so because of that, this film certainly gets a few marks. Oh, and the entertainment value, particularly if you liked the first one, is definitely there as well.So, several years have passed since our intrepid heroes finished off the horde of zombies at Pacific Playland, and now they find themselves at the other side of the country, hunkering up in the Whitehouse. Well, civilisation has collapsed, so honestly, why not. I guess this is one of those things that I love about this film because I haven't seen all that many zombie films where they take the opportunity to live it up or sleep in places where, well, you certainly wouldn't be allowed to sleep before the apocalypse. I guess people just assume that the Whitehouse would have been destroyed (and for some reason, I just can't see Walking Dead going down that way).Anyway, Little Rock has all grown up, and now she wants to get out and see the world, so she and Witchita do what they are good at doing, and just leave, and of course Columbus is absolutely devastated, that is until they meet another woman hunkering in the icebox in a shopping mall. Well, they certainly have brought a new bunch of people into the film now, which I also think is pretty cool. Actually, Little Rock meets a hippie, and they head off to a commune where they can live free of zombies.The funny thing is that the Zombies have evolved, so we have the T-800, which are unkillable killing machines, we have the ninjas, which are silent but deadly, and we have a couple of others, which I'll leave for now, but needless to say, that was pretty amusing as well. Of course, they have turned killing zombies into a fine art form, so of course, it is no longer just a matter of killing zombies, it is killing zombies in the most imaginative way possible (and of course, how is it that they find out about the others, when all communication has been cut).To finish off, this was actually a pretty entertaining film. In fact, it was a really entertaining film, particularly if you liked the first one. I guess the whole waiting ten years for it to come out certainly had an impact on that as well. So, yeah, I did really like this one.",Zombieland - Double Tap

There was a lot of laughter in my screening.Woody Harrelson is as awesome as he always is, and is on top form, its always nice to see Emma Stone playing a fun role, her parts down so serious lately!! Yes, i know she is an Oscar winner and she should be playing the best parts she can get, its just nice to see her having fun in a role again, as she is a good comedic actress, I love some of her facial expressions.Now, when I hear the name Abigail Breslin, its always the little girl from My Sisters Keeper and Little Miss Subshine who pops into my head, I always forget the has grown up!! Even though I though i though she was great in Maggie with Arnie. She is fun here too, although her character is more of a plot device than anything else. A bit of a waste of her talents.But it was Zoey Deutch who steals the movie for me. She was such an unexpected, delightful surprise.

32,cruise01,Not as fresh as the original but still fun with its double tap on the action.,7,23 October 2019,"3.5 out of 5 stars.Zombieland: Double Tap is the zombie comedy sequel that took a little too long for it to be made after the first movie. Which the excitement is not as fresh or energetic like the first movie. It is double down to what the first movie was but the cast ensemble did have fun with their roles and the movie did have some entertaining action zombie bashing fun. I felt like most of the laughs were played in the trailers.The plot continues Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Wichita (Emma Stone), and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) as they try to have a normal life. Living in the white house and trying to have a normal family life. Little Rock is feeling like she wants to have a life of her own and find a guy to love. She runs off with some hippie like guy Berkeley (Avan Jogia) who knows a colony that lives in peace and guns free zone. The trio go out searching for Little Rock which they come across Madison (Zoey Deutch) and Nevada (Rosario Dawson).The plot tries to continue with another theme about family. Columbus and Wichita are struggling on moving to the next step with their relationship. Tally is still conflicted about being a lone wolf. Little Rock wants to find a guy of her own. Columbus runs into Madison at a mall which she is not a bright character. But she adores and respects Columbus. Which he is very much attracted by. The concept idea that zombies are evolving which they refer to as T-800 zombies. Which they are faster, smarter, and difficult to kill. The colony Little Rock is taking refuge at is weapons free which makes them vulnerable to these new breed of zombies.The characters are still fun. There is also some fun stupid humor. The humor does get a little old and boring sometimes. Columbus referring and narrating his rules again does get a little repetitive and lost its touch the second time around. It worked the first movie cause it has never been done before about surviving the apocalypse. The second movie over does it with the rules. Even when the trio meet their counter half with Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch. Which they are just like Tally and Columbus. Watching Jesse and Thomas battling it out with their rules and commandments is just dumb.The film does deliver on its zombie fun action sequences. Especially during the climax, when they are trying to stop the army of evolved zombies from going into the peace colony. With lots of shoot em up action and bloody slaughtering the undead. It was a bit entertaining.Overall, Zombieland: Double Tap is a pretty fair film. It may not be as fun and exciting like the first movie. Which the writers tried to bring the same concept twice with the rules and how to survive the zombie apocalypse. Which over did itself. And does not work twice on screen. The cast ensemble is great and fun with their characters. The zombie fighting action is entertaining at least.",Zombieland - Double Tap
33,Floated2,Essentially a repeat of the original,6,14 May 2020,"Zombieland: Double Tap was highly anticipated since the film has been announced. And leading up to its release, there were definitely many skeptics regarding the film and how it would manage. As a film, this is very similar to the original, except a few new characters come into play.The comedy here feels more forced and more try-hard than in the original, resulting in several repeated jokes. Also there is more emphasis on the rules by Jesse Eisenberg's character. Where in the first film there was much more suspense and thrills.Here this sequel is quite essentially a repeat of the first, besides new locations. And a few new characters. Although Zoey Dutch steals the show with performance as she was part of the highlights.Another thing is now that Abigail Breslin is grown up, her character is essentially the weakest link and much more annoying. The love interest hippie peace character also becomes quite annoying and stale after a while.There are some enjoyable moments and a bit of good humor but as a whole, the original is better. Simply because it was fresh and unique (in a sense). This is far more predictable as well, with the ending climax not as great.",Zombieland - Double Tap
34,eddie_baggins,A rare comedic sequel that works!,7,20 October 2019,"While it was never going to capture the lightning in a bottle vibe of the first film, a film that came out of nowhere to become an audience pleasing hit that remains a fan favourite to this day, the purely enjoyable nature and solid comedic delights of Zombieland: Double Tap comes as a genuine surprise 10 years on from Ruben Fleischer and his cast's original outing.There's not many instances in cinematic history that a 10 year's in the making sequel ends up being more than decent and even less instances in the comedy genre, so Double Tap deserves a pat on the back for bucking that trend and giving fans of the original exactly what they wanted, more laugh out loud banter between our mismatched characters, epic zombie kills and memorable cameos, that help ensure Double Tap's brief run-time never lags in the entertainment stakes.To be clear, in a one v one battle 2009's Zombieland would win hands down and Double Tap is unlikely to leave as much of a lasting impression as the first film did but thanks to Fleischer's energetic direction and staging of action scenes (almost as if Venom never even existed) and the returning cast members chemistry and comedic timing, there's barely a dull moment to be found in this newest zombie filled outing that knows what it is and what it's audience wants.It's a great get for Double Tap to once more have Woody Harrelson's hard-edged Tallahassee, Jesse Eisenberg's nervous and rule-centric Columbus, Emma Stone's world-wise Wichita and Abigail Breslin's now grown-up Little-Rock together again and while Breslin has seemingly lost a fair chunk of her pre-adulthood charm and acting smarts, the rest of the cast have a ball returning to these characters, that in many ways helped shape their last decade in the film industry.Without missing a beat the main cast of Double Tap get to also enjoy added additions such as a scene stealing Zoey Deutch as the dim-witted but likeable Madison, Rosario Dawson as Tallahassee's female doppelganger and fellow Elvis fan Nevada, while an extended cameo by Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch plays out perfectly in some of the films best moments.All this joy from the cast and quick-moving pace helps cover up some of Double Tap's more obvious flaws such a wafer-thin plotline that's not even worth mentioning and a finale that lacks the bite of the first film but when all is said and done, nit-picking on these moments is pointless in a film that never takes itself too seriously, gives us some awesome new zombie kills of the week and introduces us all to a new word that's sure to take off in the form of being ""Murrayed"".Final Say -Super fun, super dumb and superficial as they come, Zombieland: Double Tap has no real right to be as enjoyable as it is and while it never reaches the comedic heights of the first film, this sequels ability to work suggests there's room enough for another Zombieland adventure still. Let's just hope they don't keep us waiting another 10 years.3 ½ pacifists out of 5",Zombieland - Double Tap
35,leonblackwood,Mindless zombie killing fun! 4/10,4,23 February 2020,"Review:
As I'm not a big fan of zombie movies, and I don't think that Jesse Eisenberg has any screen charisma whatsoever, my expectations for this film wasn't that high. The only reason why I decided to give the movie a chance, was because I enjoy watching Woody Harrelson's movies, and the first film wasn't that bad. This film does take some time to get going, and the comedy element wasn't that great, mainly because Bill Murray wasn't in the majority of the film. All of the actors put in an average performance, especially Jesse Eisenberg who wouldn't stop whining through the whole film, but the bonus material at the end with Murray was brilliant. I'm glad that the director chose to make it more of a road movie, than a ""humans killing zombies"" film, and the relationships between Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), Wichita (Emma Stone) and Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) gave it a dramatic tone, but the script was more ridiculous than funny. Rosario Dawson (Nevada) was a good addition to the cast, and I liked the scenes with the Columbus and Tallahassee's clones, but a majority of the film was weak and silly. There is some zombie bashing towards the end of the film, which is not for the squeamish, but it's mindless fun if you're not expecting any special. Personally, the Bill Murray scenes during the end-credits were better than the whole movie, and I loved it when he said, ""I ain't afraid of no ghost"", and I was surprised to see the Columbia sign bashing zombies at the beginning, but the main core of the movie was just worth a one-watch. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Ruben Fleischer, who also brought you Gumball 3000: 6 Days in May in 2005, Zombieland, 30 Minutes or Less, Gangster Squad and Venom. He's due to direct the highly anticipated Uncharted movie, with Tom Holland stepping in as a young Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg taking on the role of Sully, Drake's old, crusty pal and sudo mentor. Chris Pratt was offered Nathan Drake, which would have been a better chose in my eyes, but he declined the role. As for this movie, although it didn't smash the box office, I personally don't think that the director was that surprised because it was made for a niche audience who demanded a sequel.Budget: $42million

38,digitalbeachbum,Meh. I had a better idea for a script,6,26 January 2020,"Sequels have a track record of being crappy movies. It is a rarity for a second or even third movie to be up to par with the first movie. The Empire Strikes back is an example of a movie which was as good or better than the first movie. Zombieland: Double Tap is one of those movies which is OK but not great as compared to the first movie.You have the same core four main characters, add four extra minor characters and then some new zombies, and another ""destination"" for everyone to end up at in the final scenes. The same special effects, which were good. The same one liners which were OK. Then new love interests.I really enjoyed seeing Abigail Breslin blossom in to a woman. When she did the first installment ten years ago, she was only 14 years old. Now at 24 she is quite the young woman, full figured, adult looking. She has shed the childish image of her previous movies. I did not like the character development though. I thought it was out of character for her to do what she did.Woody, Jessie and Emma are all great in their roles and they did a fantastic job of improving their characters. There were several scenes which were really thought out and mixed up things from the first movie. The Elvis stuff was awesome.I thought Zoey, Luke, Thomas and Rosario all did great supporting roles.There were several scenes which were not well thought out. The one I disliked the most was the monster truck vs the armored car.If you didn't stay for the very end, then you missed out. There were two additional scenes with Bill Murray at the end, one right when the credits started and then at the very, very end.

40,matthewssilverhammer,"No nut-up, all shut-up",4,26 October 2019,"Both Zombieland films were initially created as television shows. Sitcom-style jokes, broad characters, episodic storytelling; I think that original intent is apparent. You can feel whatever overarching plot there is getting lost underneath the desire to shove raunchy jokes and ultra-violence onto the screen. The first skates by on comedic surprise, uniquely (at the time) droll tone, and the strength of its band of misfit characters. Double Tap, unfortunately, doubles down on weak storytelling and cynically dated comedy.
After 10 years, our four heroes are once again called to travel across the US in order to kill and escape as many brain-eaters as possible. There are some fun conceits involving hippies, makeshift communities of survivors, and the idea that culture never moved beyond 2009. Otherwise, most everything falls as flat as a head-shot zombie. It seems like the filmmakers learned all the wrong lessons from their interim Deadpool years, taking Zombieland much further into an obnoxiously meta world, and doing it with little-to-no real purpose...even as a joke it mostly falters. Sure, the Oscar-nominated leads are giving their all (minus the bored Stone), but they can only do so much with the script their given.
This may all seem pretentious, holding this zombie comedy to anything other than ""big dumb fun"", and I guess in some ways it succeeds at that. The zombie action (though FAR too sparse) is bloody and amusing, the new cast additions are great, and Zoey Deutch's brilliant turn as an airhead mallrat runs away with the entire movie when she's onscreen. But even on that lowest of levels, the movie mostly mistakes tired jokes, bright colors, and lots of famous people for creative entertainment.",Zombieland - Double Tap

It fact it's sort of stupid and largely plot less.Just rambling. Meeting others. Zombie killing. More Rambling. Not good.,Zombieland - Double Tap
43,southdavid,Zom B-Minus,7,22 October 2019,"A decade later, the Oscar winning/nominated cast of Zombieland reunites for an unlikely but welcome sequel to their 2009 hit movie.Now a makeshift family, Columbus (Jessie Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone, Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslen) set up home in the White House. Though mostly happy, Little Rock in particular wishes for more friends her own age, so when she meets Berkley (Avan Jogia), they dump the rest of the group to head for Babylon, a pacifist commune near Memphis. The other three, alongside another survivor Madison (Zoey Deutch) head out on a rescue mission.So, in my review of ""Zombieland"" I said that the best thing about the film was the principle four characters, so the first good thing about this sequel is that it's a chance to spend more time with them. I like them, I like the characters, I never got the feeling that any of them were showing up reluctantly, or just for the money. I also feel like, plotwise, this is a better that the original. Less a series of vignettes and more a cohesive story, that has a theme. The cast additions are OK, Both Madison and Berkley have some humorous moments despite initially looking like one note roles. I was a bit concerned about the ""duplicate"" characters that featured heavily in the trailer, but fortunately they both aren't in it for very long, and contribute to one of the most technically strong and memorable set pieces around the middle of the film.I do feel, as I did following my ""Zombieland"" rewatch in preparation, that this movie too is just a little bit lacking to make it to the top of any of my ""Best of"" thoughts. It's not quite funny enough, it's not quite inventive enough and though better - the story is not quite developed enough for that top tier status. I had fun, don't get me wrong - and If they make another one in 2029 I'll probably show up, but, for now, I can leave Zombieland behind.",Zombieland - Double Tap

The original had some charm, the sequel has little to none...",4,13 February 2020,"Sequels are always difficult, because producers wanna repeat a formula, money hungry producers wanna repeat the success, instantly forgetting that any good film's basis for success is originality and most sequels are simply NOT original in any way.The original Zombieland movie had some charm. It wasnt superb, but still quite enjoyable. This sequel though, from the get go, desperately wants to be funny and fails at it quite miserably. There is more bad news: I need some serious characters I can believe in, even in a comedy, before I can really appreciate the jokes. But the characters in this sequel are flat cardboard characters and boring stereotypes.It simply bored the heck out of me after half an hour. It has no good jokes, no true to life acting, no distinguishable originality.

45,Vartiainen,"More of the same, but still pretty entertaining",6,28 September 2021,"Six whole years have passed since the events of the first film - mainly because they can no longer sell Abigail Breslin as a preteen, so time must have passed - and the gang is still dorking their way through a zombie apocalypse. But it's not like this was the most functional group to begin with.This film has many of the good qualities of the first film, sans the originality of it, of course. It's still very much tongue in cheek take on a zombie film and quite honestly more focused on the hijinks of its main cast rather than the living dead. They're there mostly for background noise. But it works and many of the jokes are quite good. As are the action scenes.My main problem with the film can be distilled to what I would like to call sequelitis. In this instance, six years have supposedly passed, but aside from Little Rock (Breslin) suddenly being a young woman, this could have taken place two months after the original film. But because it has to be six years, it feels like the characters have been frozen in time. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) and Wichita (Emma Stone) still feel like a couple that just got together, while Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) still feels like he hasn't quite decided whether or not he wants to be a part of this group.It would have been so nice for this film to actually cut to six years later and honestly explore just what has changed. Now nothing has and the gang goes through the exact same problems as in the original film. Which feels cheap.Still, it's by far not the worst sequel I've seen and when it works, it's a perfectly serviceable action comedy.",Zombieland - Double Tap
46,paul-allaer,Enjoyable if formulaic sequel lacks the element of surprise,6,19 October 2019,"As ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" (2019 release; 95 min.) opens, Columbus addresses the audience (in voice--over) that a lot has changed since we last heard of ""the gang"": ""Like the Eskimos have many words for snow, we now have many words for different types of zombie: Homer, Hawking, and Ninja."" Following the opening titles, ""the gang"" (Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock) fight an army of zombies and take over (what remains of ) the White House, much to their liking. But it isn't long before Wichita and Little Rock, each for their own reasons, decide to split, and they hit the road... At this point we're not even 10 min. into the movie , but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: it's been 10 years since the first ""Zombieland"" was unleashed (I think that is an appropriate way of describing it) upon us. The inevitable sequel has languished in development hell for YEARS, but not that it;s finally here, was it worth the wait? The original director (Ruben Fleischer), writers (Rhett Reece, Paul Wernick) and cast (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) have all reunited for the occasion, and the interplay between Harrelson and Eisenberg is the glue that holds it all together more or less. Newcomers Zoey Deutch (as the beautiful dumb blonde) and Rosario Dawson (as the tough as nails Elvis Presley-themed hotel manager) provide some much needed spice and spark. But other than that, this really is nothing new as compared to the original Zombieland, except that the CGI is better yet, and the body count in in the stratosphere. There are some truly funny moments too: when Little Rock's love interested plays Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"" on his guitar and then claims he wrote the song, Little Rock shoots back ""Even a Trump girl knows a Dylan song!"". (Do you think Trump himself would've recognized the Dylan tine? Are you kidding me?) And along the way we also get some cool references to Portishead, Phil Collins and others...""Zombieland: Double Tap"" opened wide this weekend, and I was really looking forward to seeing it. The Friday early evening where I saw this at in a large theater was surprisingly not well attended at all (about 10 people in total). The movie has drawn decidedly mixed reviews (it's currently certified 66% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). That sounds about right to me. ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" is not bad but the movie feels very formulaic and of course lacks the element of surprise of the original movie..

48,jtindahouse,"Not particularly funny, with zero plot - only a charismatic cast to save the day",6,24 March 2020,"If you have a look at the cast for the 'Zombieland' movies the first thing you notice is that none of the actors are actually known first and foremost for their comedic abilities. They're all very charismatic and talented, but that doesn't necessarily equate to being funny. Make no mistake, the 'Zombieland' movies are out and out comedies. Their sole purpose is intending to make you laugh, but I really can't say I laughed much during 'Zombieland: Double Tap' at all.There are some fun action sequences with the zombies in this film and that's probably when the film is at its best. You can only get so creative with those scenes though and once you've seen someone shotgun blast a zombies head off once, you've seen it a thousand times. The plot in 'Zombieland: Double Tap' was almost non-existent too. One member of the group leaves and the others try to find her. That's literally it. I know the film doesn't want to get too heavy into plot but surely a little more effort than that could've gone into it, right?The thing that keeps this film watchable is the previously mentioned charisma of the cast. Even if you're not laughing, you're at least being charmed by them. 'Zombieland: Double Tap' really is the definition of a cash grab though. It's a sequel ten years later, that adds absolutely nothing to the original and doesn't even have a story to tell. I was a little bit disappointed by this film, however it is far from being unwatchable. If you're a fan of the first then give it a chance.

Now it's ten years later, and all seem to slip back in there roles almost feeling like they never left. And I gotta say it's even funnier that the first, the comedy really gets dialed up to 11.

The bulk of the movie consists of ""funny"" dialogue between the characters, for a zombie movie the living dead don't get a great deal of screen time. And when they do the gore effects are mainly rubbish looking CGI. I know that there are fans out there who love this and its predecessor but not me.

This is a sequel to the 2009 Zombieland-Yep, it's been 10 years-with the four main stars returning and some nice cameos thrown in, for good measure. I liked the opening of the film with the Columbia Pictures Torch Lady fighting off zombies. Woody, Jesse, Emma and Abigail are all living together in the White House. Abigail-being 10 years older-decides that she wants to strike out on her own and find people her own age so she does just that. Woody, Jesse and Emma go in search of her and discover new adventures, including some super evolved zombies-they are nicknamed T_800's by Jesse from one of his favorite movies, the Terminator-and they are a lot harder to kill. During the end credits, one of the stars sings the Elvis song 'Burning Love'-watch the end music credits if you can not identify the person. Some of the cameos were shown in the trailers but there is a surprise one just as the end credits start-it shows 'Day Zero' of the zombie outbreak-and there is also a scene after the end of the credits. So, don't leave too early.
It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, drug content, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.

Everything feels like a time-chewing diversion, like a whole slew of side dishes without an entree.Double Tap has some inspired moments - Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch as cut-rate stand-ins for the male leads, most memorably - but man, it really misses the sense of urgent motivation that was everywhere in the original. Each new plot development or character feels lazy, thin and temporary, and without the fresh allure of learning those famous rules of survival, it all comes up a bit lacking. Points for the wacky new breeds of zombie, though, and for a tremendous, unexpected mid-credits scene that, er, feels more energetic and inspired than half the material in the feature.

56,alindsay-al,A Great Sequel That Brings The Zombie Madness,8,22 October 2019,"The Zombie genre is one that I feel is pretty outdated but I loved the first Zombieland film, it felt fresh and like it was making fun of the whole zombie genre. I was excited for this film and I have to say I didn't enjoy this film as much as the original but this is still a really fun film and a really worthy sequel. The Premise of the film sees the group of survivors living as normal life as possible until one of them makes a decision that affects the whole group. For me Woody Harrelson is a mixed bag, in certain roles though he can be fantastic and this is one of them, he is so charismatic in this role and just so likeable to watch he is so entertaining to watch and is clearly having a blast in the role. Jesse Eisenberg is similar that he is good in some things and poor in others but I also really like him in this role and feel him and Harrelson have excellent chemistry and they are just so fun to watch. Emma Stone is back for this film and she does a really good job, her character has a natural progression from the first film. But I thought some of the characters didn't work as well in this film, Abigail Breslin is back and is just not particularly interesting in this film, her character is made to be more annoying in this one and unlikeable but she is nothing compared to Zoey Deutch in this film who at first was a bit funny but becomes so annoying so quickly and actually drags the film down a bit as she is just that annoying. The story is fun, seeing this crew have to deal with zombie apocalypse is fun but this film does feel very basic and a bit lackluster in it's story. It is a simple road trip movie and the pit stops are sometimes entertaining but also sometimes it just feels a bit misplaced. The script is really funny, the one liners in this film are great and the family chemistry really works, the drama isn't exactly ground breaking but it works for this film and fits it naturally. The style is possibly the best part of the film, it is so unique and I like how it classifies the different zombies and how the rules of this universe are explained. This film is the right length and feels like it moves at an appropriate pace. Overall this is a great sequel that really helps add fresh life to zombies, also this film has one of the best post credit scenes I have seen in recent memory.",Zombieland - Double Tap

The real road movie now commences as they set off in search of Little Rock.A new breed of super-zombie has evolved, harder to kill, this provides opportunities for puns and visual jokes. Indeed Double Tap is infused with cultural references, jokes about Uber and homages to The Walking Dead and Z-Nation. Tallahassee even finds love with the owner of an Elvis themed motel, Nevada (Rosario Dawson), just as well because Graceland itself is in ruins, breaking Tallahassee's heart. Even though this is obviously a comedy there are some really gruesome sequences and harrowing scenes of desolate ruined cities and deserted freeways. Most poignant perhaps is the Hippy Pacifist Commune Babylon, really reminiscent of one of the odder settlements in TWD.An action comedy but sometimes laughter will die in your throat at the absolute devastation inflicted upon society.

The original cast is back and as good as ever, along with some new minor characters along the way. Zoey Deutch and Rosario Dawson are the new standouts for sure, making for some rather humorous situations. Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch character seem rather forced however, and hardly important to much of anything. The script does seem to struggle with what it wants to do, and or where it wants to go for some parts of it, and at times feels like your just living a life in the world of Zombieland rather than a true film experience. Besides this though, the film does have enough humor to keep you satisfied and some killer after credits scenes that are bound to make you smile- especially if you're a fan of the first one. In the end, Zombieland: Double Tap can be a bit uneven at times, but it is a decent sequel to a comedy movie which is rare enough as it is.

69,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Not a bad follow up to a solid Zom/Com,7,1 November 2019,"I'll be honest I really liked the original when it came out. It was a sweet spot for me at the end of college, I came around to enjoying horror comedies a bit more and zombies is a sub-genre I have a lot of love for when it is done right. This film I remember being talked about almost immediately after the original and it seems to have been in developmental hell since then. I did find it weird that it finally got made and released a decade after the original. This review is also being updated after a second viewing with Jaime. The synopsis is Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock move to the American heartland as they face off against evolved zombies, fellow survivors and the growing pains of the snarky makeshift family.This one starts off showing us that we are getting more of what we did in the original, but it introduces something new that the zombies are evolving. We get to learn the different types and how some are smarter than others. Columbus is narrating this to us and reveals what their plan was, to hold up in the White House and create a semblance of normalcy. The crew is getting under each other's skin though. Tallahassee is playing father figure to Little Rock and she doesn't like it. She's also lonely for a boyfriend. Columbus asks Wichita to marry him and she freaks out. This causes the two ladies to flee and only leaving a note.Columbus is saddened and in turn making Tallahassee mad, forcing him to listen to it. Things take a turn when they find Madison (Zoey Deutch) who's been living in a cooler inside of a local mall. She's been alone for years and immediately clings to Columbus. This gets awkward when Wichita returns because Little Rock met Berkeley (Avan Jogia) and ran away with him. This infuriates Tallahassee, who's been itching to get back on the road, even more now to save her. It also makes for an interesting dynamic with Columbus, Madison and Wichita.Their journey takes them in the direction of Graceland where they meet Nevada (Rosario Dawson), Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch). It also brings them to a new zombie that is stronger, faster and harder to kill than the ones they've encountered along the way.My initial thought on this one when I saw that it was being released is that they might have waited too long. It does create issues for me as someone who really focuses on story. In a comedy like this, I don't really expect them to go too much into the ins and outs of their survival. To its advantage we know this takes place after Zombieland, but we don't know how long. If they were on the road for 10 years, what did they do for food? Eventually that's going to be an issue. If it hasn't been that long, Little Rock has grown up quite a bit, being how young she was in the original. It just kind of creates an issue that I would think about. Again, being that it is a comedy, they gloss over this.I didn't hate it though. I will admit that I had a few drinks before going to see it the first time and I actually laughed more than I thought I was going to. A lot of that is there's something about Tallahassee's character that just makes me laugh. Columbus has his awkward moments that resonate with me and I like Wichita's sarcasm. I do like they introduced new characters here as well, so that definitely keeps it fresh. Madison is annoying and Berkley is so pretentious. I think that it works though as we don't really connect with them or at least I didn't.My problem really with the movie though is just that it feels like the same as the original, just tweaking things here and there. I know that as fans, if you like the original, then you should want the sequel do exactly what this one is doing. That becomes though, when there's other similar films out there doing the comedy thing, just better. That's my way of saying I liked it, but that it just didn't do a lot for me.I will take this to the pacing, which if you've read my reviews, you know that horror comedies usually struggling in this aspect for me. Much like this one, I'm never worried about our core four being in trouble. I did like they introduced characters and then let them die, so we at least get a bit of that. I like some of the places they go to, it helps us learn more about the characters. I wasn't the biggest fan of how this plays out in the third act. The love story of Columbus and Wichita did work for me though, as it does seem years in the making. The idea of this place Babylon is interesting and I think there's an allegory there. Going along with this, there is some really good writing with things that Tallahassee says that plays into what they do in the end.Shifting to the acting, this is something I can't talk down on. Harrelson is hilarious and fits this role perfectly. Eisenberg works as the nerdy guy, who is overthinking this and let's be honest, would probably be me when the zombie apocalypse happens. I absolutely love Stone and think she fits her character perfectly as well. Breslin is solid and I like that since she's grown up in this new world, she's a bit naïve and wants more since she never experienced it. Deutch is a fun addition and makes for some really good comedy, but she is quite annoying. I like the cameos of Dawson, Wilson and Middleditch as well. They and the rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.To the effects of this film, I do know there's a blend of CGI and practical. I'll start with what I like which are the practical effects. The zombies look good. I have to give credit there. This one doesn't play it up as much as the previous one as none of the make-up stood out and we don't get as distinct looking zombies. I really didn't have any issues with the CGI either. They don't overdo it aside from the ending sequence, but that's really the only place where I was rolling my eyes. They did bring back the floating words from the first one as well. At first I didn't want that, but it didn't bother me as we got into this. I thought that it worked with the rules, as that is funny. It didn't with the opening credits as what we're seeing on the screen interacts with it. That didn't work in my opinion. They can be clever with it. It was shot very well overall.Now with that said, if you like the original I think you'll probably enjoy this one as well. It doesn't really do a whole lot new, but they did change and add things to at least make it feel a little bit different. I like they got the core cast back together and added some fun new ones here. Being that it's a comedy, it doesn't really build the tension that I would like and I didn't care for the ending. I didn't have any issues with the effects though, either the practical or the CGI. The soundtrack didn't really stand out to me, but it did fit for what was needed. Overall I'd say this is above average. It's not great, but it is enjoyable and I did laugh quite a few times.",Zombieland - Double Tap

The End Credit SceneThe VERDICT:Zombieland 2 is a decent sequel that offers the same laughs and dose of comedy extremes that the fanbase seems to love. It has enough nod to the old to make fans smile, but also added enough new to help actually make a second tap worth the effort, primarily in the writing, references, and Woody Harrelson taking charge once more. Yet, as many sequels show, the film's evolution brought more superficial thrills to the gene pool than actual plot, resulting in a rather shallow pool to kill in. Over usage of gimmicks and personality flaws, while underutilizing new characters, locations, and even the action to a degree made me a little sad at the lack of inspiration. Still it's got the fun medium and special effects to warrant a trip to the theater, especially in a group like the sports teams did the other night at my theater.

Not only it is pretty much lifted from Left 4 Dead, but there it is done for mechanics.I just don't appreciate ""smart"" zombies: that's not the point of them. And the tougher zombies are equally problematic, even as subtle as they do it in here, as having super zombies makes defenses too easily overrun and causes their scenes to feel a bit forced.But none of that makes this movie any less fun.",Zombieland - Double Tap

78,arungeorge13,Barely does justice to the original! [+48%],5,29 December 2019,"Ten years post the original and a mediocre sequel thou shall receive!Zombieland: Double Tap almost manages to undo everything viewers loved about Zombieland. With double the budget, key actors reprising their roles, a fun wasteland setting that could lead to so many probabilities, and even an interesting opening scene, Double Tap does raise your hopes for a little while. Harrelson continues to be terrifically wacky, Eisenberg continues to be geeky, Stone continues to be a badass chick, and Breslin, well, enters her early 20s (lol!).Of the four main characters, Breslin's Little Rock is probably the weakest in Double Tap. Her scenes have been written with the least amount of zing and it's not long into the movie before Zoey Deutch (playing a dumb blonde; full marks there!) joins the wacky club (almost replacing Little Rock). Double Tap, unfortunately, struggles to hold its own ground. Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee remains the entertainer throughout but the writing (by Dave Callaham, Rhett Rheese, and Paul Wernick) is so uninspiring and dull this time around, with many scenes not hitting the intended mark.The zombies have evolved, Columbus says, but they never end up looking like a threat unlike in the first movie. Zombies serve merely two purposes in the film: a) the reason for the crew to stay together, even while on the move, and b) to assemble a (pyro-filled) climax set-piece. There are several forgettable characters in this film such as the ones played by Rosario Dawson, Luke Wilson, Thomas Middleditch, and Avan Jogia that barely contribute to the humor or to the screenplay as a whole.Zombieland was America's answer to Shaun of the Dead and it should have been left as a standalone film if the writers didn't have enough meat for a part two. When the sole intention of a sequel is to set the cash registers ringing by milking the nostalgia of the original, the content tends to take a backseat and that's exactly what happens in the case of Double Tap. The only double-tapping here goes for that hilarious Bill Murray mid-credits scene.",Zombieland - Double Tap
79,Abdulxoxo,Very entertaining!,7,9 January 2021,"The film is rather simple in structure. Our cast move along from one set piece to the nest, fighting zombies and cracking jokes. I like the film's simplicity, and I think it works. The zombie kills are just as gory as the original, with great fun being had with their inventiveness. That's what this film is all about though. Had it tried to become more serious and meaningful, it would have lost what made the first film so popular. Like the original, Zombieland: Double Tap aims for darkly comedic entertainment and hits its target. From a technical perspective, costume, hair & makeup are well done. The production design is also very good; and the soundtrack is excellent as it makes great use of the Elvis Pressley discography. There's also little messaging about family and what it really means to be home. Overall, it's not quite as good as the original, but I can't deny having an amazing time watching it.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Yeah right!The writers decide to bring along every piece of baggage from the last outing.A huge part of the story is ""hey do you remember in the last film when we did this? Isn't it hilarious to do it again and reference back to it?""
Yeah once or twice - but it shouldn't be the basis of an entire movie.The story is just stupid and so contrived it feels like you are watching a show specially programmed for young children with especially crippling learning difficulties.Everything that was fun in the first movie is brought back and ramped up to eleven, losing any subtlety so it just becomes ridiculous.It seems the director worked on the premise that when in doubt throw a monster-truck at it.If this was non-stop action that would at least be something but there are painfully long stretches or dialogue where the characters don't really have anything to say to one another - at points it feels like watching Big Brother.The original is a classic relying on great performances, excellent story, a cutting, witty script and an amazing concept.This sequel is an overly dumb action movie that lacks story and coasts along on small injections of over the top action.",Zombieland - Double Tap
88,one9eighty,Welcome back - nothing has really changed.,7,21 September 2020,"A decade after the events of the first film, the team of Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita and Little Rock are split up. Little Rock - forever wanting to be treated as an adult; and Wichita - scared by a marriage proposal by Columbus, make a run for it. Columbus find a new 'friend' in Madison but this is only short lived as Wichita comes back to the fold. They decide to leave the comfort of the White House, and travelling across the country in search of Little Rock via Graceland. Since their last adventure a more dangerous breed of T-800 zombies have appeared on the landscape, which is a definite hurdle they will have to overcome as they journey towards a commune called Babylon. Along the way, all four must explore themselves, their wishes, and their desires so that they can come to terms with themselves and their place in life.With a bigger budget and bigger cast, director Ruben Fleischer gets the 'team' back together to try and repeat the success of the first film. However, the tried and tested action and humour only carry so far as this film only improved on the box office takings of the first film ever so slightly. This had a budget of $42 million and grossed $122 million at the box office, while the first film had a budget of $23.6 and grossed over $100 million at the box office.The idea for a sequel came up before the first one was fully released, cast and crew all voiced their interest in developing things further, and there certainly was scope to do so. The idea was to develop a franchise because there was that much scope to do so, and because everyone really enjoyed themselves. The original cast all signed up quickly, and others such as Rosario Dawson, Zoey Deutch, Avan Jogia, Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch were brought in.With a runtime of 99 mins this film certainly delivers a nostalgia factor by reuniting the stars of the first film, but it does not really bring in many new things that were not already done in the first film. It is more of an exploration of the characters rather than progressive development. Columbus and Wichita consider their feelings for each other; Tallahassee has to get over the fatherhood that was stolen from him and start doing things that he wants to do; and Little Rock, still obsessed with growing up, goes looking for her teenage fun years. Little Rock is the main plot devise in this film, but while the journey is centred on her, she is only a small player in the overall film. Reinforcing the fact that it doesn't really bring anything new to audiences, this film goes with the same narration, the same visual text overlays, the same jokes, it's even got the same kind of cameo in it from Bill Murray again. The film tries to parody itself with the Albuquerque (Wilson) and Flagstaff (Middleditch) characters, but this felt like something that has already been done before elsewhere, in fact, that same feeling was something that happened in a lot of the set-up's too, from the way Madison (Deutch) is 'dumped' to the inhabitants of Babylon.Despite not bringing anything new to the table I still enjoyed the film. It's not on the same level as the first film for innovation but it is still bloody fun that allows you to leave your brain at the door, to watch the lovely aesthetics as the simple plot unfolds on screen. The best aspect of the film for me is the 3 main actors of Harrelson, Eisenberg, and Stone. Yes, I know that Abigail Breslin is one of the central 4, but she seems to take a backseat in this. Even Zoey Deutch gets more screen-time than a Breslin's reoccurring character - not that I'm complaining. As much as Deutch's character is irritating she is well delivered and almost steals every scene she is in. While Harrelson and Eisenberg shone in the first film, Stone really come into her own in this film. She refuses to be pigeon-holed and goes on her own voyage of discovery. She is kick-ass with the action, but she also delivers some great comedy timing and high levels of sarcasm.This is an unnecessary sequel, but it is still enjoyable enough. Expect the same comic book style approach to action, the same level of humour, the same... well a lot of the same. Fun, but nothing new.",Zombieland - Double Tap

90,aciessi,No Bite.,4,23 October 2019,"It's been 10 years, and Zombieland hasn't changed a bit. Some might say that's a great thing. It would be, that is, if the blood splattering world of Zombies didn't change with it. The Walking Dead came along and evolved the Zombie genre forever. Zombies are the in thing. Everyone likes them, even little kids. In that sense, Double Tap has nothing else to offer. It a greatest hits album. So safe, so lazy and so uninspired.I would be remiss to tell you that, spoiler, there aren't that many big zombie moments in Double Tap. When they appear, it's just for filler. A few heads get smashed here and there. Then we have the gang just hanging around various locations, with nothing else to do. They hang out at the White House, a motel outside of Graceland and a hippie commune, and yet nothing interesting happens. In fact, I couldn't count on one hand how many interesting ideas weren't utilized in Double Tap. For example, what would happen if Columbus (our grand encyclopedia of survival) have been infected with the zombie virus? Imagine the possibilities of Jesse Eisenberg playing a reluctant, hyper-intellectual zombie. Or, how about a more expansive look at how the rest of the world has dealt with the Zombie virus. We get one joke that hints at that, but it's a cut-away gag meant to be forgotten about minutes later.So what if the film doesn't blow our minds with good ideas? Does it make us laugh? From time to time, yes. The carbon copies of Tallahassee and Columbus (played by Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch) are worthy of a few belly laughs, although for a real show-stopper, I would have cast Michael Rooker and Michael Cera. The post-credits sequence with Bill Murray is the real prize, and it's worth sticking around for it, if nothing else. All in all, Zombieland: Double Tap has no bite, and that's a real shame.",Zombieland - Double Tap
91,rockman182,Zombieland: Double Tap (2019),8,20 October 2019,"I remember enjoying Zombieland when it first came out but if I'm being honest I don't remember it too well. Well, a decade later the sequel is finally out, after being in development hell. Its also nice to see the original cast returning on top of other brand new faces. Not going to lie, I had a blast with this film. It was 90 minutes of pure balls to the wall fun and honestly might be an improvement over the first film.The film takes place after the events of the first, where the core group of zombie killers make The White House their home. One day, Little Rock and Wichita depart with Little Rock running off with a hippie. At the same time, a new breed of smarter, faster, and less destructible super zombies are discovered making life harder for the gang. Relationships are tested in Z land but the cast must remember to look out for one another as the go on a wild journey.I may not remember a whole lot from the first film but Double Tap doesn't really miss a beat and is presented in the same format with Eisenberg narrating and the film defining its rules regularly. Its nice to take a comedic approach to zombies because its a genre that has been overdone to death and it needs to poke fun at itself to succeed now. The violence and zombie action is as good as it gets but I think the true strength of the film comes from the very entertaining supporting characters. It was brilliant having a second version of Tallahassee and Columbus. Also, Zoey Deutch's portrayal of a dumb blonde was excellent and a highlight of the film.I laughed at a lot of the segments in this film. The characters are all wonderfully likeable and have good chemistry. The new supporting cast add a great deal of entertainment value and the film should do its job of pleasing fans of the first. It wasn't an absolutely necessary sequel but for me is one that takes what occurs in the first film and improves upon it.

93,Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Another fun romp in a world filled with creative, floating text.",7,25 October 2019,"It's a little weird to me that it's been a full decade since Zombieland (2009) came out. While I thought the original film was goofy and fun, it has since gained a bit of a cult following. What's weirder to me is how-in the years since the original-many of the cast of this franchise have gone on to be nominated for (and in some cases won) Oscars for their acting talent. It's no wonder the advertisements for Zombieland: Double Tap (2019) have picked up on this fact and used it to promote another ridiculous foray into the self-aware satire of zombie films.While I do admit that Zombieland: Double Tap does require having seen the first film to pick up on its numerous references, I also knew that its comedy would be as smart as its predecessor. I appreciated this wit, especially with a few literary references thrown in (like to Of Mice and Men). However, even if its dialogue is smart and snappy, the characters themselves are relatively one-dimensional and flat. Sure, putting a couple of different stereotypes together in an ""end of the world"" scenario is fun to watch. However, there isn't much substance there past the tropes-even to the point where another identical set of characters comes along to show how crazy the team-up is.Despite not trying anything significantly new, Zombieland: Double Tap does seem to improve on its predecessor, even if it's in predictable ways. After all, it's still the same ""road trip"" movie wrapped in the skin of the living dead. There isn't much explanation of the zombies (either how they got there, or why they were evolving). Instead, new stereotypical characters are brought on board to mix up the inter-character dynamic from the first film in a way that seems logical in its progression from the first movie to the next. At this point, I'm expecting whatever the third installment of this series is to include some sub-plot about pregnancy; it's that predictable.Another fun romp in a world filled with creative, floating text, I give Zombieland: Double Tap 3.5 stars out of 5.",Zombieland - Double Tap
94,RforFilm,"Though the jokes are hit and miss, Zombieland: Double Tap is a funny sequel with more zombie kills",7,22 October 2019,"""Not knowing who Bill Murray is like not knowing who Gandhi is!"". This is one of many quotes from Woody Harrelson as a guntoating badass in the horror comedy, Zombieland. I certainly recall this comedy as it not only managed to come out during the height of zombies in pop culture, but it made it its own thing. Zombie comedies are nothing new considering Shaun of the Dead, Warm Bodies, Return of the Living Dead, and even ParaNorman. What helps Zombieland is that despite having a world similar to a lot of other zombie movies, it was able to build it's world more clearly thanks to its rules as imposed by the characters and making the goals simple and easy to identify with. When was the last time you've seen someone whose goal is to get to the Twinkie factory?While I don't count it as the best of the zombie comedies, Zombieland still made me wonder what adventures these characters would go on in this world. I assumed a TV series would happen, but it didn't. Instead, we got a sequel...ten years later. Timing doesn't matter as much, so lets see if Zombieland: Double Tap can still deliver with the same cast.Ten years have passed since we've last seen them and they've been holding up in the former white house (rest easy, there's no political jokes). Tallahassee (played by Woody Harrelson), Columbus (played by Jessie Eisenberg), Wichita (played by Emma Stone) and Little Rock (played by Abigail Breslin) have become a close family as they live and survive in a world still infested with zombies. Because three of the main characters are adults, Little Rock wants to meet people her age. This is an odd request that Tallahassee denies. When Columbus finally proposes to Wichita, this scares her into leaving and taking her sister with her.At first, Columbus goes through depression and then meets a new girl, a ditzy mall girl Madison (played by Zoey Deutch) and tries to move on. But Wichita returns, admitting that when she also denied letting Little Rock into meeting others her age, she ran away. The crew (and Madison) set out to Graceland, which was where Little Rock has wanted to go, where they meet Nevada (played by Rosario Dawson) who reveals that she was seen joining a hippie to a gunless commune. They make their way to the commune, along with a major hoard of zombies following behind.Some might look at this and already get a sense of ""more of the same"". In a way, I think a lot of people are going to expect ""more of the same"" in Zombieland: Double Tap and that's also what I wanted...and it was fine. I can't go as far to call it great, but with this setup, are there a lot of great things that can be done? I still laughed a lot more then I thought and enjoyed a good zombie killing or two. I think how this turns out will depend on what you were expecting.Story wise, the goal is still simple; to keep the family together. There's no talk of ending the zombie outbreak or trying to recreate society. It's still all about the characters survival. Zombieland has always worked on that and returning director Ruben Fleischer knew not to stray too far or get too emotional. Despite being a horror movie, I count this as a comedy first, especially when you realize that, like a lot of comedies, this has more of an episodic feel (which is why I always thought this would be good for TV). This did lead into more of an unpredictable plot which is a welcome change.If I had to demerit this movie, its that the jokes are hit and miss. This is hard to talk about with comedies, but because their subjective, what I may find unfunny may be hilarious for someone else. For example, there's a moment where the main characters come across similar versions of themselves (clearly a homage to Shaun of the Dead), which didn't get much of a laugh, but the people I saw it with seemed to like it.I'll give this eight Twinkies out of ten. As long as you weren't expecting a lot out of a second Zombieland, then I think you'll just be as happy as I was. Come see it and happy hunting!.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Harrelson, Eisenberg, Stone & Breslin share that same effortless camaraderie, that made the original so memorable. Zoey Deutch is hysterical as Madison. Avan Jogia is good as Berkeley. Rosario Dawson is excellent as Nevada. Luke Wilson & Thomas Middleditch are unforgettable as Albuquerque & Flagstaff, respectively. The supporting cast is great. Zombieland: Double Tap is a must watch for Zombieland(2009) fans. Go & have a blast!",Zombieland - Double Tap
96,bankofmarquis,I ended up enjoying this film,8,1 November 2019,"I really enjoyed the 2009 Horror/Comedy ZOMBIELAND - a truly unique and original film that blends the trendy (at the time) Zombie genre with really smart comedy populated by some truly charismatic comedic performers and a GREAT surprise cameo.So...I greeted the news that there would be a sequel - 10 years later - with a shrug. Why would they want to revisit this tired (at this time) genre with performers that have (for the most part) gone on to ""bigger and better"" things (including a few Oscar nominations and 1 Oscar win). But...I enjoyed the first, so I figured I'd check it out. And...for the first 20 minutes or so of this film, I sat there with my arms folded across my chest thinking ""they are just trying too hard to replicate the first film"". And then an interesting thing happened...I chuckled to myself. Then I chuckled some more, and then I started laughing out loud and at about the 1 hour mark, I realized, ""I'm really enjoying myself"".Credit, I think, has to go the charm, charisma and chemistry between the 4 returning leads - Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg, Abigail Breslin and Woody Harrelson. It was like running into 4 old friends and old, comfortable, patterns re-emerge (kind of liking eating comfort food). These are ably assisted by good, fun turns by the likes of Rosario Dawson, Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch. Special mention has to be made of Zoey Deutsch's turn as blonde air-head, Madison. This could have easily been a one-note, annoyance. but she brings something more to role that makes her endearing, not cloying.The original creative team - Director Ruben Fleischer and Writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick - are back as well, so the style and humor are similar to the first film - not really bringing much new to the proceedings, but not just ""getting a paycheck"" either.This film is ""nothing new"", but I enjoyed it anyway - so if you liked the first Zombieland, you'll like this one as well. ONE NOTE - there is a ""credits scene"" as well as a ""button scene"" at the end of the credits that are MUST WATCH. So stick around for those, you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Zombieland - Double Tap
97,fernandoschiavi,"A great sequence to the first one. Have a charismatic cast, memorable cameos and full of hilarious situations and action scenes",7,21 April 2021,"Continuing certain franchises - which were not meant to be franchises, by the way - is always a risk. Risk of losing the timing, of being just an uninspired copy of the first part, or even of its actors having aged a lot. But of course it is not a general rule of Hollywood, see the critical success of ""Blade Runner 2049"", which came ""only"" 35 years after the original's premiere. It only takes a convincing script and a dose of joy to relive that story and those characters on the screens. Due to the success of Zombieland (2009), the writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick soon planned a possible sequence, with many more ideas that they wanted to explore. In addition, they wanted to turn the comedy into a lasting franchise. Reese and Wernick had suggested ideas and the cast expressed their desire to make a second film, but due to other projects, the writers ended up postponing the sequel for a few years. In 2017, a script had been written and the cast was on board, and the film was confirmed in July 2018 by Sony Pictures. Lead quartet and director Ruben Fleischer signed in the same month, while other cast members, including Rosario Dawson and Luke Wilson, joined in early 2019.In Zombieland: Double Tap, years after coming together to cross the beginning of the zombie epidemic in the United States, Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) keep searching for new ones places for shelter and survival. When they decide to go to the White House, they end up meeting other survivors and realize that new directions can be explored.In this second film, things are a little different now. Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) is now a young adult, Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) and Wichita (Emma Stone) remain a couple, and Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) follows a ""lone wolf"". In fact, talking about the main cast, it is worth mentioning that during this period Emma Stone won an Oscar thanks to her performance in La La Land.For a decade, in fact, the life of the quartet is what appears in the films: breaking into houses, shops, finding safe places to sleep, killing many zombies and struggling to survive. But the secret of Zombieland, being exactly what it was 10 years ago, is exactly what makes the new comedy as grand as the first film. Do you have romance? Yes, there is romance, and not just between Wichita and Columbus. And what would be a love story without drama, right? If you remember the character in the first film, you know that she had an agreement with her sister, Little Rock, that they would always be them for them. So, don't think she settled down that easy, despite so long.Despite repeating jokes and situations that we have seen before, the script now signed by Dave Callaham and the well-known Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick also brings some news. Another characteristic of teenage comedies or romantic comedies of the 2000s is the characters full of stereotypes and caricatures. In the midst of a whole drama between Wichita and Columbus, Little Rock and Wichita, we met two new characters: Madison (Zoey Deutch) and Berkeley (Avan Jogia). Starting with Madison, who is undoubtedly the highlight of the continuation of Zombieland, we see that she brings all the stereotype of teen comedy films of the 2000s, like Mean Girls, for example. All pink, blonde hair bizarrely arranged for those who live in a zombie apocalypse, forced and irritating accent, in addition to a naivety that, throughout the film, we see that does not make the character with less personality. Madison is responsible for hilarious dialogues with the characters already known and, at first glance, brings a little discomfort due to the forced stereotype and the conflict with Wichita, but which, with the course of the plot, becomes essential for the evolution of the character. She is also responsible for most of the laughter caused by the film. We also met Berkeley, a young man that Wichita and Little Rock meet on the road. The boy also stresses the stereotype of musician, hippie and pothead. Avan Jogia's character is the only one who doesn't work so well, although we understand his motivations are in the film.Another very fun moment of the plot is when the group goes until what was the home of Elvis Presley, who has the real belongings of the ""King of Rock"". There, we see the scene of some of the funniest scenes in the entire film and also the place where three new characters are introduced: Nevada (Rosario Dawson), Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch), the latter identical in appearance. And personality with Tallahassee and Columbus. Albuquerque has that country accent and sense of leadership, while Flagstaff is a great ""Robin"" for his ""Batman"", and also a little obsessed with the rules of survival for the zombie apocalypse.It is when it goes to humor that the film manages to take value from the relationships between its characters and promote the unpretentious schizophrenia of the whole - the disappearance of Little Rock becomes funnier after Berkely (Avan Jogia) enters the scene. Even visually this is a work that does not intend to achieve much in an aesthetic sense, in addition to very slow motion and a sequence shot that is more concerned with what fits, an absolute confusion, than with the actual framing. Although it is rare for an amusement park to use zombies as a theme, this does not mean, however, that the result obtained will necessarily be genius. On the contrary, the feature is full of repetitive jokes, which embrace a punchline and repeat it over and over, as exemplified by the man in Babylon who constantly comments on orgy. At other times, the jokes are even the most obvious thinkable - like the one with The Walking Dead. Other than that, the appearances of Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch extend on time just so as not to cause a consequence to the narrative. Even so, in the midst of several exceptions that make the experience still positive - Rosario Dawson has a lot of chemistry with Harrelson - the most notorious resides in Zoey Deutch's character, Madison. Zoey embodies the archetype of the dumb blonde, but the script is clever in using expectations, inherent in the cliché, to surprise.Although this is a very uncompromising project, the points it enjoys are able to create a cohesive unity of argument, even if the argument only wants to achieve unpretentiousness, not necessarily comment on something about the United States. There is an astonishing purpose in terms of creating entertainment at the expense of an entire nation, which continues the prospect of the first feature film in making this amusement park so inviting. In a way, this continuation of the comic work of 2009 is as its name suggests: a confirmation, not a renewal, of what had already been built before in terms of entertaining spectators. The maximum that advances to a new scope embraces countries other than the United States, but momentarily and with the same purpose - the joke with the Tower of Pisa, for example. So that leisure is realized, therefore, that it is in double dose, as a revisit to your favorite theme park. It is necessary to ensure, in this case, that every inch of this Zombieland will be visited, which certainly does not happen in just a single opportunity. In view of the new discovery that there are now super-powerful zombies, so shooting twice doesn't seem to be enough.Zombieland: Double Tapis a road trip in which the script is based on funny, ironic and sharp dialogues, in addition to introducing new characters that make a positive difference in the film. Without losing the essence of the first feature, this sequence presents a narrative that emphasizes the personality of each character and recalls the famous rules created by Columbus. ""Double Tap"" does not skimp on the jokes, resuming the fun of remembering Columbus' rules at different times, and the zombie killing is still a separate entertainment. But the one who definitely steals the show is Harrelson, who managed to set a tone even more crazy than before for your character. The choreography of the action scenes also got an upgrade in the continuation: without much story to tell, having only evolved zombies wouldn't sustain the fun. La ""Mad Max"" to show that, in fact, Zombieland got even wilder and without limits. Each one survives as he can. Another thing that continues in the same way is aesthetics, abusing slow-motion in action scenes and texts that merge into the scene and also collapse with it with each collapse that needs to be stopped. It's the repetition of what worked, the recipe for the cake being used again just because the joke remains the same, yes, and even after so long, it's still funny.Ruben Flescher gets it right again and delivers a sequence of the same level as the previous one with regard to the charisma of the cast and memorable participations of great actors, especially in spikes, and in the elaboration of a still consistent arc, in which you care about the characters. However, he sins when he tries to expand the story using a shallow and hurried situation, without emotion, even at the conclusion of it. Although filled with Ex-Machina God moments as a narrative resource, this sequence shows that certain stories are worth revisiting, especially when the fun and absurdity come in double and the actors feel comfortable reviving their old roles. The post-credits scene is unexpected and definitely not to be missed by those who liked the funniest arc of the first feature. And when you're on a zombie-infested Earth, you have to laugh so you don't cry - or die.",Zombieland - Double Tap
98,agmoldham,Great Fun,6,21 November 2019,"The first thing that surprised me when watching this movie was to realize that it was a sequel. Those in the know will know that the original Zombieland was out about 1 years ago. Whilst there's no doubt that a few of the nods to the previous film will have gone over my head anybody else who isn't familiar with the first film will be able to enjoy this as a standalone movie.The one thing that I took away from the movie was an incredible sense of joy and fun. It's an enjoyable film to watch and you get a sense that the cast were having fun making the movie. Not really sure there's too much that needs to be said about it. The plot isn't up to much, but you wouldn't expect anything else. The action comes think and fast. Lots of enjoyable acting performances and I especially liked Zoey Deutch as Madison.",Zombieland - Double Tap
99,allanmichael30,Zombiebland double cr*p,4,22 August 2020,This film lacks feeling of original and just dumb story built around Elvis gun he gave to president. They had wasted cameo of Owen Wilson and Rose Dawson with cheap sex jokes hardly entertaining. The cameo of Bill Murray was lack luster and about Garfield something i have no interest in. The lack of vision in this movie that it felt the need to include another Bill Murray scene. You might as well just watch original movie again and save yourself from this flop.,Zombieland - Double Tap
100,kjproulx,A Late Sequel That Was Worth The Wait,8,22 October 2019,"Zombie films have nearly always been a popular thing throughout the course of cinema. From Dawn of the Dead to The Walking Dead, this particular sub-genre of horror has always been in the zeitgeist and I can't see that changing anytime soon. There are so many films and television shows made revolving around Zombies these days that it felt like a breath of fresh air when Zombieland hit theatres back in 2009. Hilarious, fun, and surprisingly heartfelt at times, it really seemed they caught lightning with the first film, which made me incredibly worried that they were pumping out a sequel a decade later. Thankfully, it was absolutely worth making.Picking up years after the events of the first film, Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock have all grown as individuals and feel much more mature, even though they are still very much the same characters. With the looming threat of evolved zombies on the horizon, the group divided once again, and additional characters stepping in to add humour and some depth to the overall story, Zombieland: Double Tap continues in a very natural way off of the first film.I loved the first film when it hit theatres and after rewatching it over the years, my love for it has only grown further. For this reason alone, I had to lower my expectations for this sequel, because I knew it wouldn't match the first. That being said, I had a blast watching this movie. It's hilarious, heartfelt, and a lot of fun, just like its predecessor, but I will admit that some of the humour fell flat for me. I was laughing throughout, but I would argue that there are far too many callbacks to jokes from the first film. Not just once or twice either, it happens numerous times throughout the movie.Aside from that, Harrelson, Eisenberg, Stone, and Breslin all share great chemistry once again and it was just nice to see this group back on the big screen together. With the addition of Zoey Deutch as a new secondary character, I was able to find enjoyment in ways the first movie didn't deliver on, which was a nice surprise. There's absolutely nothing groundbreaking here, but with the slew of horror films that showcase zombies these days, this is one of the best mainstream films to do so in the last few years.In the end, Zombieland: Double Tap is a worthy sequel to the first film. Although it does rehash jokes, it also offers some new, clever humour that had me busting a gut on multiple occasions. It drags in some areas throughout the second act, but the run time is short enough that you don't really notice. This film is a fun ride from beginning to end and I would gladly see a third film in another decade from now if this cast is all still willing. It felt very natural after ten years, which was my biggest fear. If you're a fan of this genre, a good comedy, or just simply liked the first movie at all, then I would absolutely recommend giving this one a go. It's also probably the best straight-up comedy to hit theatres in 2019.",Zombieland - Double Tap
101,kuarinofu,Sony is desperate,4,19 December 2019,"Zombieland: Double Tap is a boring, dull, uninteresting and extremely unfunny sequel.The first half hour of the film is literally nothing. After that things happen themselves, useless characters appear and die instantly. Then the film ends with nothing and we find out that the characters have all this time even had some kind of motives and some sort of goals (because they literally say they did).Jesse Eisenberg tries to do his usual routine again, but it doesn't work anymore. Tallahassee is always just pissed off about everything. Wichita has absolutely nothing to do and is merely a plot device. All the events that happen in the movie are meaningless.This movie reminded me most of the remake of Ghostbusters. This film is not that different from the first part as GB 2016 was with the original GB, but the attempt to earn money and the lack of understanding of their own material make these cases very similar.There is only one funny segment in this and it is the post-credit scene, however, I do not recommend you to watch this mess only to get to the scene.",Zombieland - Double Tap
102,Movie-Misfit,"More Of The Same, But Still Entertains!",7,26 October 2019,"I really enjoyed Zombieland on its release many moons ago. It was a fresh take on the genre and genuinely funny! For me, it's only let down was the unnecessary drug humour during Bill Murray's scene... I'm not a fan of drug-use for humour and felt that the film had enough great comedy writing that there was no need to go down that route for a cheap laugh!And unfortunately, it seems to be something they have doubled up on in its sequel - once again cheapening the well executed comedy throughout the rest of the film.And I have to say, apart from we really aren't getting anything new here, that would be my only gripe for Double-Tap!Jumping right in as if we hadn't waited a decade at all, we join the team as they take refuge in the White House and take their relationships to another level - or try to at least.Before we know it, the team disband and shake things up...It isn't long before we get introduced to the hilarious Madison (played by Zoey Deutch) who helps break up what could have been just a straightforward copy of the first film. Her character is funny and refreshing and made me laugh out loud probably most of all.Zombieland 2 isn't as amazing or as surprising as the first, but it definitely entertains just as much! No doubt we will get a third chapter pretty soon which will hopefully tie it all up before the format runs dry.And be sure to stick around for a fun mid-post credit scene that is worth your entry fee alone!",Zombieland - Double Tap
103,nicholls905-280-546911,Disappointing sequel,6,19 January 2020,"Sequels are tough and to say Zombieland was crying out for a sequel, is just a false statement. Fans have been begging for a sequel for quite some time and that wait is finally over. The films character's are still great and the ballooning support cast was quite small and allowed the core characters to shine again. I had expected something more self aware and attempt to evolve the genre, much like the original had fresh ideas. This was okay, but not a worthy successor. They may need a trilogy to save face with this series. Not great, just another tiresome sequel attempt.",Zombieland - Double Tap

I knew she will turned out to be annoying n I was so right. She is so annoying n I hate her. The Bill Murray montage was the best part of the film, but the action was a bit lacking and the story didn't have as much depth as the first one. Considering they had 10 years this was really boring, they seem to have forgotten the premise of the film, zombies. there were huge gaps of drama to then only give you a small taste of zombie action, and even those were pretty lame. Even the opening sequence fell flat with Master of Puppets, great song but did nothing compared to the first film where the song actually worked. Very few laughs and the CGI was awful. sorry but the movie was bad, complete disaster! just do yourself a favor and never watch it, not if you love the first one.

106,msbreviews,Rating: B,7,26 October 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)As you probably know by now, since I posted the original film's review a few hours ago, I loved the first Zombieland. I defend that it's a zombie cult classic, and I was genuinely pumped for its sequel. It didn't go through any external controversy (something quite rare nowadays), the cast didn't say anything wrong in the interviews (haters didn't have enough words to twist this time around), Ruben Fleischer returns as the director, as well as Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (plus a new member, Dave Callaham) as the screenwriters. If a studio wants to do a 10-year sequel, it might as well get the creators and original cast back together, right?!That's what I love the most about Double Tap. It didn't lose the original's essence, and it didn't forget what made it so successful. The cast's chemistry can be felt thousands of miles away, but the new additions also fit in seamlessly. Zoey Deutch portrays Madison, a purposefully stereotypical ""dumb blonde girl"" who has some of the funniest scenes as well as some of the most cringe-worthy (Deutch gives an excellent performance, though). And Rosario Dawson plays Nevada, basically a women version of Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), which means she has a bunch of badass action sequences. As for the old gang, well...Everyone delivers great performances, but this time, Harrelson really elevated his character. Not only does he have the expected awesome kickass moments, but he also offers some emotionally compelling displays. Emma Stone (Wichita) and Abigail Breslin (Little Rock) keep being amazing as their characters, and Jesse Eisenberg (Columbus) does get a bit too ... Jesse Eisenberg, but it never stops feeling natural, having in mind how his character acts. These four are the heart of the whole show. Hence, getting the original cast back together is halfway through success, even more than in the first movie. Story-wise is where I do have some complaints, unfortunately.Maybe it's due to the fact that I watched 2009's Zombieland just a couple of hours before Double Tap's screening, but I wish that Fleischer and his team were more creative. Sure, the original was 10 years ago, and not everyone is going to rewatch the original (especially not right before), so it's expected that a lot of classic moments are recreated in some shape or form. However, for an extended period, I felt that I was watching the exact same film, just with older characters. I know I'm going to hear some of Columbus' original famous rules, but there's a surprising lack of new ones. I know Tal is going to repeat some of his catchphrases, but he's an imaginative guy, he can think of fresh ones (which he does say in the last minutes, but still).To move the plot forward or actually make the story happen, a lot of questionable things occur, and not in the sense of them not being rational (it's not like Zombieland is a groundbreaking piece of storytelling). It's the apparent lack of character development through all of the years that have passed, and I'm not addressing their personalities being the same (it's pretty normal). To create this movie, characters make decisions that don't feel right, having in mind they spent so much time together. It's impossible for love, trust, and emotional attachment not to be developed throughout such a long time. So, while Little Rock's arc is understandable and relatable, Wichita and Columbus' lacks convincing arguments, in my opinion. Both make decisions too dumb for such intelligent characters, but I guess ""that's love"".Once again, the technical features that defined the original so clearly are seamlessly employed in its sequel. Beautiful production design, cool soundtrack, fantastic application of practical effects and real sets, which nowadays are getting rarer. The slightly longer runtime still manages to carry a fast pace, which is always a good attribute, and it's packed with thrilling, hilarious, bloody action sequences. Amusing pop culture references, and the most significant moment of all: Double Tap has one of the best, if not THE best, mid-credits scene of the year! Don't you dare leave the theater, it's right at the beginning of the credits, so stay in your seat!All in all, Zombieland: Double Tap pays a decent homage to the original zombie cult classic by getting everyone (cast and crew) back together, and delivering yet another entertaining flick. By maintaining the essence of the first film, Ruben Fleischer is able to capture the outstanding cast's chemistry, as well as present those amazingly entertaining action sequences. Even though the central narrative isn't as straightforward and interesting as in the original, it's still captivating enough for the audience to care about. There is an excessive amount of callbacks to classic catchphrases, rules, or moments, which shows a bit of a lack of imagination to create new material. While it's not as funny or entertaining as the 2009's movie, it's still a good time. If you're a fan of Zombieland, definitely watch it! If not, well... Nut up and watch it or shut up and let others enjoy it.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Blending Action, Fun, Comedy and Zombie in a single mixture isn't easy as it may seem. Well the first part did it pretty well but not this time. As this sequel is rough in places and needed very much polishing especially on the writing front.All the cast members done a good job by gripping us through an otherwise mediocrity filled plot with their comic timings and chemistries. Cinematography looked decent, sound score too sounded nice only the screenplay could have been a lot better. There were lot of rooms for improvements in the dialogues as well. Some have landed some didn't! The comedy element is lesser effective here as the director focuses a little too much attention towards Gore and Violence. Although I must admit; I freaking loved that. But at the same time was craving for more comedy. As this was supposed to deliver.In short, it's an above average Fun ride; that I enjoyed to a certain extent.

113,MrDHWong,Successfully follows most of the rules for a sequel without ever losing sight of what made the original a hit in the first place,8,17 October 2019,"Zombieland: Double Tap is the sequel to the 2009's zombie comedy film ""Zombieland"" directed by Ruben Fleischer (Venom). Once again starring Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin, it successfully follows most of the rules for a sequel without ever losing sight of what made the original a hit in the first place.After over a decade of surviving in a post-apocalyptic zombie-infested America, Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone), and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) decide to settle down in their new home at the abandoned White House. Tired of being treated as a child by the rest of the group, Little Rock runs away after falling for a hippy boy named Berkeley (Avan Jogia). Determined to find her missing sister, Wichita sets off to search for her with Tallahassee and Columbus not far behind, all while fighting their way through smarter and more evolved hordes of zombies than they had previously encountered.As fast-paced and quick-witted as its predecessor, Zombieland: Double Tap avoids the common tropes of most sequels by continuing the story of these four survivors without rehashing too many elements. It's just so surprising that a sequel ten years in the making can still feel so fresh and original, especially in this oversaturated post-Walking Dead zombie media world we live in now. This is likely due to the fact that the original came out before the genre had reached peak mainstream popularity, and as a result was able to create something unique out of it.Like the first film, this one has a very straightforward plot, helped along by its wonderfully written characters and brilliant amounts of humour flowing through each of them. Woody Harrelson gets the most laughs as Tallahassee, especially from his hilarious interactions with Columbus and some new faces like Rosario Dawson and Luke Wilson. However, Abigail Breslin, who has grown noticeably in between films, helps anchor the story with some great dramatic scenes due to her desire to be seen as the adult she has now become.The zombie action is considerably more frequent this time around, adding to the enjoyment factor. It's still so ridiculously fun seeing how the four members of the cast come up with ways to outsmart the undead, all the while trying to follow Columbus's lengthy set of rules for survival.Overall, I'd say that anyone who enjoyed the original film will find plenty to enjoy with this sequel. At this point, I certainly would not be against a third entry to the series, assuming we don't have to wait another ten years for it to be made of course.I rate it 8/10",Zombieland - Double Tap

116,CANpatbuck3664,"Zombieland: Double Tap is Funny, Consistent and a Blast to Watch.",9,18 October 2019,"Zombieland: Double Tap had a lot to live up to, releasing a comedy sequel many years past the original release date is almost always a death wish. Making a funny and successful comedy sequel is hard enough but Double Tap had a couple things working in its favour that not every movie gets. Despite the fact that they've all become huge stars, the original cast all came back. The same team core team of writers (Rheese and Miller) penned the script and Ruben Fleischer is in the director's chair again. There's considerable continuity from the 1st movie and I think Zombieland: Double Tap is better for it. They don't miss a beat, the characters are consistent (minus a little deviation from Little Rock), the humour is witty and self-aware, the action scenes are well shot and get the job done and the visual sensibility is maintained and doubled down on. Is it the perfect package (at least it was for me) the 1st one was? Not necessarily. But while some sequels try to re-invent the wheel, you get more of the same from Zombieland: Double Tap without it being a direct copy or sloppily rehashed. Where that first movie worked for me, Double Tap did as well.Starting with the jokes, I really enjoy most of Rhett ReIese and Paul Wernick's work. They seem to have a knack for knowing when to be meta without pushing too hard and they can write funny material while staying true to character motivation and thought process. Double Tap is very self-aware, from the opening credit jokes, to comments on other zombie centric programming. They know what's gone on since the 1st one came out and they know what to skewer and what to leave alone. Double Tap isn't a complex story, it has a very simple plot through line, just like the original Zombieland. But their comedic sensibility is on point, there's more than a couple references to the first one for the fans, there's comedic gold in some of the new characters and their screenplay keeps the movie moving without getting bogged down. I'd make a quick note that there's a super funny bit after the credits with a returning character, instead of bolting out of the theatre, stick around for something hilarious.Our fearsome foursome of leads are not the up-and-comers they used to be (minus Harrelson who was already well established) but despite their A-status and busy schedules, they all returned for this. It shouldn't be a surprise that they're all excellent, they slip into these roles again like a warm pair of slippers. Harrelson still has his goofy ""Tallahassee"" charm, he was not only hilarious but he was a compelling and fun character in the first one. Tallahassee has more attitude and less brains in Double Tap but Woody is still as competent and he had me laughing throughout. Zombieland was a launching pad for Stone and Eisenberg, both showed a ton of promise in the original entry and they've both capitalized on it. Stone is more even keeled and steady in this one, she's as close as you can get to the voice of reason. She's still got great chemistry with Eisenberg and the rest of the gang. Her romantic subplot with Eisenberg was an underrated aspect in Zombieland (it actually worked where other movies fail) and she's a wonderful actress who absolutely holds her own. If I were going to hand out a best performance, I'd probably give it to Jesse. He's got the Columbus ticks and nervous energy down pat, his character has matured and is a capable member of the team. Jesse is true to the character while adding a couple of new dimensions. Abigail
Breslin is pretty good but I wish she had gotten more to do. I would also echo that for Rosario Dawson, she's vastly underrated and while she's a nice addition to this cast, I feel like we could have spent more time with her character Nevada. The surprise MVP is Zoey Deutch as Madison. I didn't like her in the trailer but many of the funniest jokes in the movie are centred around her. Her character is playing off an archetype but not only is the dialogue funny but her delivery is spot on. She made me laugh a lot. Thomas Middleditch and Luke Wilson are solid in their small roles.I left the theatre trying to think of flaws for Double Tap but I couldn't come up with much. A couple of things wrap up quickly in the end that feel a little rushed, but that's largely minor. The action scenes and the visuals are both passable and suitably gory. I also liked where the movie finished up. I just didn't find many weak links. The only place I thought the original was clearly above was the CGI work with the rules. For me, you still can't beat the rules physically interacting with the characters, there was a concerted effort to bring a new element to them in this but I still preferred that element in the original.The only place Double Tap suffers is in comparison to the original. Maybe not everyone feels this way, but the original Zombieland is a special movie to me. It was so fresh at the time, the jokes are fantastic, the plot is simple but well executed, the cinematography and camera work serves both the action and the drama, the visuals still hold up and the cast is magical with the fantastic material provided. I think Double Tap is a fine sequel and a worthy successor to Zombieland. Does it surpass the 2009 film? No, but its not as far behind as you would think. It won't have the same staying power but it was satisfying on every level. I did leave the theatre a little disappointed though. Why couldn't they get this out quicker? With how well made this movie is, they could have had a real franchise if they had struck while the iron was hot. Double Tap is excellent but I wish we had gotten it 5 years ago instead of 10. Maybe we'd be on 3 by now if that was the case. I'd give Double Tap an 8.5/10 rounding up to a 9/10. I think its more geared toward the fans but there's enough good stuff for the uninitiated. Especially if you're a fan of Zombieland, its worth seeing in theatres for sure.",Zombieland - Double Tap

118,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,14 February 2020,"The stage curtains open ...Ten years after the first ""Zombieland"" comes this long overdue sequel. The problem with waiting so long to release a sequel is that, after a decade of waiting, the initial sting is gone. Would that be the case with ""Double Tap""? At first, yes. But then as the movie continued along, I found myself having fun all over again.Our foursome of zombie vanquishers are now living in the White House, having settled into a semblance of a semi-normal life. Columbus and Wichita are flirting with the idea of marriage, Tallahassee is his usual off-the-wall self, and Little Rock is all grown up now. However, when Little Rock decides to carve out her own slice of life and leave with Berkeley (who is from Berkeley), a guitar strumming pacifist - Tallahassee and crew hit the road to find her, leading them to a place of refuge known only as Babylon. Along the way, they meet up with Madison, a truly clueless blonde who's managed to survive (lord knows how) all this time. Once more, they are plagued with zombies leading to the film's memorable finish.This movie works, despite the lengthy wait. Woody Harrelson is finally starting to show his age, yet he delivers another fun performance. The overall story was well made and filmed. I had a lot of fun with this newest installment. The humor is witty and genuinely funny. Zoey Deutch puts in a great turn as the hapless, blonde. It was probably her character that really made this movie worth watching.I highly recommend ""Zombieland - Double Tap"". Even though the original and this sequel are so far apart, they still play side by side very well. The filmmakers did a fine job of keeping cohesion and consistency. I liked the film and am happy to have it in my own personal collection. This one rates 8 stars out of 10. A worthy sequel.

121,ronakkotian,Lacks the originality of the first one,6,21 October 2019,"It finally arrives! After ten long years, we finally get to see the sequel to the beloved Zombieland but does it match the greatness of the first film?Zombieland: Double Tap marks the return of Tallahassee, Columbus and Wichita as they travel across the zombie-infested America, encountering new people and new zombies, in order to find Little Rock.It feels so nostalgic seeing these four characters once again and it seems like that's what the makers were trying to achieve. Ten years later you get to revisit the past and enjoy the camaraderie of the group. All of it feels like the first one. The ""rules"" and witty narration also return to bring back the Zombieland vibe but this also comes across as the main problem with the film.What made Zombieland so refreshing to watch was its unique take on the zombie genre. Whilst Double Tap brings that memory back, the film lacks the originality that made the first one so good. It seemed like the makers just decided to rehash the same ideas into this one which makes this film quite forgettable.Despite that, this film is still entertaining. There are some great jokes that brought a couple of laughs from my theater as well as the chemistry between our leads. Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone all gave solid performances and complemented each other well. However, I felt Abigail Breslin was quite limited in this film and had way less screen time compared to the others which was quite disappointing. The new characters was interesting to see, especially Zoey Deutch who stole every scene she was in.If you overlook the film's flaws, you would have a great time. The performances, jokes and action are all really fun to watch. Zombieland: Double Tap isn't a bad film by any means.

122,garethcrook,Skip to the credits.,3,4 January 2020,"So I'd promised myself the next film would be some silly dumb fun, enter Zombieland: Double Tap. Did we need another zombie film? No. Did Zombieland need a sequel? No. Is this any good? Well no, not really but it's certainly dumb. Laden with exposition heavy narrative and cheap looking blood effects, I don't think it's looking to be especially innovative. Within 10 minutes I've already had enough of Jesse Eisenberg. He's the most annoying of these characters, but the rest aren't far behind. In fact the stereotyped airhead dressed head to toe in pink is the most entertaining out of the lot of them, what does that tell you. There's half an hour of dull set-up, followed by, well another 20 minutes of boring road trip, a quick introduction of some new characters that mirror Harrelson and Eisenberg (seriously as if the originals weren't one dimensionally irritating enough) before eventually culminating in discovering a hippy haven fortified utopia that looks like a cross between a school kids attempt at designing the BBC Glastonbury TV Set and Teletubbieland on acid (more acid). Having said all that I am a sucker for a spot of post apocalyptic landscape and this has its fair share of abandoned highways, nature reclaimed buildings and burnt out cars. That's probably about the only thing I enjoyed. After enduring over an hour of tedium, we get the inevitable zombie attack on said utopia, complete with 'lets get ready for the battle' A-Team style sequence and as they tackle the hoard for 3 or 4 minutes it's mildly entertaining, before it mercifully ends. Watching silly dumb fun films is a stupid idea.3/10All three of those points are for the Bill Murray post script alone. Do yourself a favour a skip straight to the credits.",Zombieland - Double Tap

I admit that the first Zombieland was a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, so I was excited for this sequel. Time sure flies. I can't believe it has been 10 years. Since then, the four leads have been pretty busy and have all been nominated for Academy Awards! Emma Stone actually won the prestigious Oscar for her role in La La Land.So, how do you make a sequel fresh? In this case, make the zombies evolve and find more living humans to add to the story. Oh, and of course, more blood and gore, the same approach taken by The Walking Dead each season until it became completely disgusting. Fans will get a kick out of the film.TIPS FOR PARENTS:NOT for children!
Lots of blood and gore. Soooooo much.
Lots of zombies
Violence, killing with a variety of weapons
Profanity, including many F-bombs
Pre-marital relations
Explosions, destruction

Funny references to zombie fans of Shaun of the Dead AND The Walking Dead.
It was smart to have it come out close to Halloween.
There's a little bit of character development.
The tone and feel match the first movie.
I didn't realize that the lovely Zoey Deutch is the daughter of actress Lea Thompson and director Howard Deutch. She did a really great job. I first noticed her in Before I Fall, a completely different movie from this one!THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:Are people still in to zombies? This sequel should have come out 5-7 years ago.
Some of the humor is tired.
The plot is pretty simple.
I heard Dan Aykroyd was in the movie. I guess I blinked because I missed him.

130,PyroSikTh,"More of the Same, a Blessing and a Curse",7,21 October 2019,"It's been ten years for us, and it's been ten years for the world of Zombieland too. Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock have decided to settle in the White House, and the walking dead have been around long enough to evolve and show diverging behaviours. There's Homers; the stupid ones, Hawkings; the smart ones, and Ninjas; the silent ones, and now there's also T-800s; the super tough ones. Despite this, Little Rock isn't so little any more, and with hormones firing craves a life a little more fulfilling and separate from her Zombieland family. Once again the group are split up and on the road searching for landmarks in the wasteland, meeting new people and getting in to all kinds of problems.With an already established cast of characters ready to go, how do you keep a sequel feeling new and interesting? Add new characters of course! Coming and going with the group this time are Nevada; the owner of an Elvis Presley hotel, Albuquerque and Flagstaff; doppelgangers of Tallahassee and Columbus respectively, Berkeley; a musical pacifist who's taken Little Rock's young adult attention, and Madison, a ditzy blonde with a suite of great ideas that have already been implemented in our non-apocalyptic world. While each of them are great and add new dimensions to the characters and their relationships, none of them really enjoy the character work the original four got in the first movie. There's no tragic backstories, and growth and development is barely present.Despite all this, and despite that kind of character usually being a cliché and annoying stereotype, Zoey Deutch somehow steals the show as Madison. It's only when she leaves the group halfway through the movie that you realise how likeable she actually was, and the development of her character was much subtler and requires reading between the lines. Tallahassee remains fairly static throughout, and his relationship with Nevada leaves a lot to be desired, despite both Woody Harrelson and Rosario Dawson always being wins. Jesse Eisenberg gets to show a stronger side to Columbus, away from the bumbling nerd of the first film and more into a guy with a backbone as he spars off against Emma Stone's Wichita.Talking of which is my biggest criticism of the film. Wichita is reduced to complete unlikeability when she ditches Columbus and the gang without saying goodbye, for an entire month, and then feels entitled enough to blast Columbus for moving on and finding someone else (which is also something Little Rock is guilty of later on). Why can sequels never find an interesting story in a happy and stable couple? Why have they always got to be broken up in order to cause a bit of drama? Splitting Columbus and Wichita up at the beginning and putting them back together for a happy ever after ending feels cheap and like retreading ground we already saw in the first film. Thankfully Columbus has grown a backbone and doesn't take any, but it would've been nice if this wasn't needed in the first place.Humour is pretty good throughout again, with a lot of jokes hitting the mark, but never quite punching through the target. Madison as a character is a gold mine of jokes, but is never reduced to comic relief, and the introduction of Albuquerque and Flagstaff is full of humourous interactions, particularly the rules/commandments comparisons. There's a lot of more subtle, meta jokes as well, such as Woody Harrelson signing a presidential pardon for Wesley Snipes, why there's still electricity a decade into the zombie apocalypse, and Bill Murray's displeasure at doing Garfield movies.I wouldn't say Double Tap is better than the first film, but anyone who thought there was a chance of that was deluded. Despite my big reservation with the narrative choice of splitting Columbus and Wichita up, and the humour not quite being as laugh out loud as before, I still thoroughly enjoyed myself. It was nice going back to these characters ten years later, and I hope we get a third movie in another ten years complete with Nevada and Madison coming back for more too. A worthy if imperfect sequel. I would definitely recommend it if you're a fan of the first film, as it's mostly more of the same. I give Zombieland Double Tap a respectable 7/10, on the higher end.",Zombieland - Double Tap
131,CinematicInceptions,More than adequate.,7,24 October 2019,"I guess the best way to sum up this movie is that you will probably get what you expect from it. If you have seen the original Zombieland, you will probably have just about the same response to this sequel as you had to its predecessor. I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing from a creative standpoint, but it's just my evaluation of it. I moderately enjoyed the original and was adequately entertained by this one. It got some genuine laughs out of me, and seeing it in theaters probably helped with that.
In the few times I've thought about it in passing over the last few days, I have started to see some issues with it. Not plot holes or anything that really alters my impression of it, but just areas that it could have improved upon. I found the story to be somewhat predictable, but it wasn't really worse for being predictable, and at the end of the day, it works.
One thing I can definitely say in praise of it is that it embraced its identity as a sequel in the right ways. The end of the first Zombieland didn't give much of an impression that the story would continue, so it didn't really have anything to deliver on. There is a ten year gap between the two movies, which is addressed naturally. Where it excels I think is in how it deals with some of the more iconic aspects of the original. Columbus' (Jesse Eisenberg) rules and omniscient knowledge of all zombie fighting activities around the country returns in just the right amount, with a few welcome twists and developments. Talahasse's (Woody Harrelson) intensely 'Murica personality is played up a lot. Where the movie really has fun is the increasingly inventive ways that the humans have to fight the zombies and deal with the post-apocalyptic state of the country.
I will warn that it is definitely harder to enjoy this sequel if you haven't seen the original. I guess that's true of all sequels, but I think it's a little more true of this. You won't exactly be lost, but there will be a lot that will be harder to appreciate.
If the all-star cast is a draw for you, I think I can safely say that they deliver. Nobody has a career-defining performance by any means, but they all play their roles well and are very entertaining to watch. To be fair, the characters aren't really developed much, so the actors are all hitting essentially the same note the whole time. On the upside, they are well cast so everyone's performance and chemistry should be moderately entertaining.
So I'm not going to recommend that you rush out to see this. If you haven't seen Joker... yeah, that's probably going to be a bit more fulfilling of an experience for you. But if Joker looks a little too deep or emotionally intense for you, this is a good alternative. Not to throw shade at any of this week's releases, but it looks like it's going to be a pretty underwhelming weekend, so I'd probably recommend this over anything opening on Friday. Despite the zombie element, it is not even remotely in the horror genre. I feel like this has been a bit of a bland review, but it's just me being honest. Unless you're averse to somewhat gory action, this should be worth your money in terms of entertainment. So don't go in with huge expectations and you should be satisfied.",Zombieland - Double Tap
132,sweidman-28016,"Enjoyable, But Unnecessary",7,30 October 2019,"Zombieland: Double Tap Review:Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock move to the American heartland as they face off against evolved zombies, fellow survivors, and the growing pains of the snarky makeshift family. Once Little Rock runs away with a guy, the trio sets off to retrieve her so she can survive. Personally I think Zombieland is a hilarious movie and I just love it. With this sequel, however, I was nervous to see how it would turn out. Really this movie is unnecessary, but it's there for entertainment. Double Tap follows the same guidelines as a trailer movie. If you saw the trailer you saw the movie essentially. I'm not saying this is by all means a bad movie, but that what it is. The story is interesting, not as much as the first, but I was entertained at all times. The humor is where it shines. Barely any jokes fell flat. Every character was funny. I love Wood Harrelson. He is and always will be my favorite character in these movies. Now that they've grown up and all it's fun to see the changes each character went through and his was the most fun. He plays the protective father with Little Rock and that drives the whole movie really. I was disappointed that Abigail Breslin didn't appear in the movie for most of the movie. Even though she was out with her love interest I would've liked to see more of their adventure there. Madison, played by Zoey Deutch, surprised me a bit. I expected to find her to be a throwawayable character but I thought she was funny and made scenes fun. Of course the character is annoying, but it was more of a fun way. Jessie Eisenberg and Emma Stone didn't have too much change to their characters and they were still the same ones we know from its predecessor. The story seemed to drag at points. I don't know if it they didn't know what else to do with the story or something, but it lost some flow throughout. The action scenes were just as good as the first, full of gore and comedy. The audience has so much fun with those sorts of things. They added a lot of CGI to this one and it needed some work. It looked bad and I just wanted the makeup like how they did in the first. Movies tend to be more dependent on visual effects now when they're not necessary. I don't know why but if there are visuals they should at least try not to make it look noticeable. Overall this is an enjoyable movie. Really it's unnecessary, but it's there for a fun time. In the week that I've seen it I'm starting to forget about it and I feel like that will happen with most audience members. It's one of the challenges a movie faces when a sequel is released ten years later. People either still love and remember the original or they seem to forget more about it and think the sequel isn't necessary. If you want a fun time, however, I'd say this a movie to watch.My Grade: B-",Zombieland - Double Tap

I don't feel like a sequels guy and he said I've never wanted to do a sequel in the previous movies I've done until this one. but sadly i don't know why and why Woody would not do sequel's for zombieland ? it's sadly first film got success it would be sad not to see those cast ever again idon't understand what's going with Woody Harrelson in his role he looks like he is having fun, he is enjoying it you can tell he is having a lot fun, if i had a role that i loved and i enjoyed if they ask me to do sequel i would but it depends how sequels are. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg confirmed in February 2010 their return for the second installment of the series, i have no idea how woody changed his mind. in 2011, Jesse Eisenberg said that he was ""not sure what's happening"" with the sequel but that the writers were working on a script for Zombieland 2. Eisenberg expressed concern that a sequel would no longer be ""relevant. but then Woody makes another silly excuses saying i am not a sequels guy ?? but what made him confirm the role then ? if he is not sequel guy but i think he is talking full of crap. in 2017 the script for Zombieland 2 had been completed, director Ruben Fleischer who directed veryfirst zombieland (2009), 30 Minutes or Less witch i didn't like, Gangster Squad that i enjoyed, Venom not so much i didn't hate film i wish tom hardy wasn't star could cast someone else, it should R RATED not much fan of Venom at all. but with this film it's well done better what Ruben did i give him credit for that going back to sequel has to be completed. at least making sequel is much morebetter then making stupid silly TV series that got cancelled what amazon thinks that's going to get huge success, they haven't followed rules, rule number 1 don't try overtake first film, without trying making this sequel to see if it's success. then finally they made this sequel it's time for nut up for shut up to TV series because now this is a kickass hardcore zombie comedy film you will enjoy.the story of this film still follows up 10 years from first (2009) zombieland film and the problem is how in earth are they still having ammo, food, how are they surviving i mean everything takes place after 10 years ago. 4 guys returning cast Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), Wichita (Emma Stone) surviving still killing zombies as usually they have become experts in identifying and disposing of various zombies i loved idea in this film witch they went to living in the abandoned White Houseand really loved costume limo president limo with a minigun at top sick idea that's perfect for a zombie Apocalypse, after Colmubus wanted to marry Wichita is because they have been in relationship in 10 years ago so he is ready to get married with Wichita so she refused she said no i am not ready. now since little rock is grown up she hope she can find a guy to have boyfriend to have family together. but Tallahassee refuse what little rock wants. so the next morning Tallahassee finds a letter just like first film when little rock and Wichita leaves them behind is because Tallahassee still treats her like a child, and Wichita's fear she is too attached to Columbus. so they go out their tosearch for them and theirs pretty girl Madison (Zoey Deutch) known for Vampire Academy, dirty grandpa, good kids, why him ?, Before I Fall. what happened Madison has survived alone for years inside the freezer of Pinkberry
but she quickly falls in love with Columbus, Columbus expect it to have sex all because that he thought Wichita was not coming back anymore. so next day Wichita got upset she didn't care at all, Madison is a dumb blonde not a strong female character like Wichita but at least she was funny and clumsy but in a funny way she wasn't very annoying a little but she wasn't annoying as hell in film. you have rest of another supporting cast like Nevada (Rosario Dawson)known for sin city, Netflix marvel shows, she is in every movies you seen her in she did fine in movie, (Luke Wilson) Albuquerque he is like another version type look like Tallahassee with redneck look and accent and so as Flagstaff, Albuquerque's partner it's like those 4 of guys are who shares similarities with Columbus Tallahassee. i liked how Tallahassee is in love with Nevada they have great love chemistry together. I laughed a bit with this film but to be honest,the only time I laughed out loud fully was even before the opening credits during the Columbia Pictures intro with your statue of Liberty. that was something that has never happened in any another movies at all. this is a very surprising sequel of all time lucky enough i thought this was going to be like spoiled sequel like dumb and dumber 2 when that got flop. Funny references to zombie fans of Shaun of the Dead AND The Walking Dead. It was smart to have it come out close to Halloween for this film wish it could come out closeto Halloween. and believe me people this sequel is should not be missed if you didn't see first film in theater, this sequel has hold it very well. it has a lot of blowing up zombies, new action scenes, tons of tons of fun it never stops it always nut up for action, comedy, gore everything you need from first film added to this Zombieland sequel still has ""Attitude"" and Zoey Deutch Steals The Movie for me because i thought she was funny for threw out movie but she wasn't very annoying she was a bit but still i think her character stole the movie. unexpected, delightful surprise. Playing the dumb blonde is a hard act to do well without being very annoying and too clumsy. Hilarious great blast! Bigger budget, new characters, amazing dialogue, and awesome soundtrack for opening I laughed more and louder than anyone else which to me was so nice I don't remember witch film i have laughed so hard in a long time. Somesuspenseful bits were so great and the surprises were perfect, I won't spoil I will just say I am very satisfied with everything. if people say to me witch is one better i recokin i say they both better because sequel still holds up just like first one because their wasn't sloppy stupid jokes or over top annoying comedy just like TV series witch is awful. don't ever leave the theater after movie ends don't forget to double tap to sit down and watch Bill Murray cameo again witch was funny and at end of credits don't ever leave or turn off film because there's mid credit scene and end of credits. if you didn't leave after mid credits or ending credits you have double tap for that. 10 out 10 i loved this movie this sequel still hold up very well after first film from 10 years ago. i highly recommended it and i hope they don't forever ever again to make zombieland 3 !",Zombieland - Double Tap

139,Magow-Intermean,Zombieland: Double Tap Review,9,15 February 2020,"Ten years after the world was overrun by zombies, survivors Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone), Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), and Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) face new challenges and new threats, including hippies, evolved zombies, and monster trucks.
Much has happened in the ten years since Zombieland came along, severed tongue planted firmly in rotting cheek, and poked relentless, irreverent fun at zombie flicks whilst creating a core quartet of memorable characters and, in Bill Murray's turn, delivering one of the great movie cameos. Off-screen, Emma Stone - then a vibrant rising comedy star - has become an Oscar-winner and one of the biggest movie stars on the planet, enough to warrant an ""And Emma Stone"" here. Director Ruben Fleischer followed up his vibrant, inventive debut with three fairly leaden movies, including most recently Venom, that suggested Zombieland might have been the odd one out. And writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese, after years of trying to get a sequel off the ground, finally mustered up enough clout, after two Deadpools, to return to the zombie well.
On screen, things have moved on ever so slightly. The world is still overrun by zombies, some of whom have evolved into new and more challenging forms. Columbus (Eisenberg) is still our narrator, and still in love with Stone's Wichita, even if their relationship is in something of a rut. Harrelson's Tallahassee hasn't calmed down any, and is making ill-advised and potentially problematic claims about having Native American heritage. Only Little Rock (Breslin) is embracing real change - sick of their nomadic lifestyle and family squabbling, she wants to hit the road. Which brings with it its own complications, and a raft of new characters.
However, where Fleischer, Wernick and Reese worked hard to make the original foursome interesting and likeable, here new characters are never allowed to come within a mile of resembling anything like a real person. Take the most substantial new addition - Zoey Deutch's Madison, a relentlessly cheerful, less-than-genius-level Valley girl who isn't given a single shred of depth, and is subject to some horribly mean-spirited hazing by the people who are the nominal heroes of the film. It's a testament to Deutch's sparky, committed performance, and some of the film's best lines, that Madison endures.
Even ten years ago, the zombie genre was oversaturated. Since then, the rise of The Walking Dead (riffed on, and dismissed, in an early scene) has only served to further gum up the works. So it's nice, then, that the last thing Zombieland is concerned with is zombies. Sure, they're always around, in several neat new flavours, and there are a couple of big action set-pieces. But the film is never more alive than when it puts its characters together in the White House (a strangely toothless sequence), or a mini-van, or a gaudy hotel, and lets them riff far from the decomposing crowd. If little of this feels that fresh or surprising, that's the curse of sequels. But it's often enjoyable, occasionally very funny, and has an energy and verve sorely lacking from Fleischer's last few films. So, while it's simply, plainly, not as good as the first movie, Zombieland is no longer the odd one out on Fleischer's CV.",Zombieland - Double Tap

141,markgorman,"To be honest, it's pretty much just as good as Zombieland.",7,20 November 2019,"I love a zombie movie. I really do. And I like spoof zombie movies just as much.Pound for pound I'd say the zombie genre is one of the most successful to hit our screens - from George Romero to Simon Pegg and here, in this now double franchise, Zombieland.Of course the original was pure gold and, amazingly, the same director, Ruben Fleisher, and the same star team of Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin (and, whisper it, Bill Murray) team up for the sequel some ten years later.Two new stars join the line up - Rosario Dawson (successfully) and Zoey Deutsch (less so as a dumb blonde that's just a bit annoying).It opens brilliantly with a zombie attack on the Columbia logo giving us the first belly laugh within 5 seconds.What follows is a sort of Fight Club (those captions including an outstanding title sequence) meets Shaun of the Dead but with much higher production values and a cracking script played out by an ensemble of genuine starts that truly look like they are having as much fun as you could ever have making multi-million dollar pay checks.Sure, it's not going to trouble any award judges. True it's not going to solve any global problems and sure it's not going to change anyone's life, but it sure is fun.If you loved Z1 (7.6 on IMDB) I suspect, like me you will enjoy Z2 (7.2 on IMDB) just about as much, maybe more.It's ridiculous and it's great.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Fortunately, I picked up the cliff notes version of the first movie's events on what happened in the first ten minutes and was able to get to the rest.""Zombieland"" is innovative in its special effects and in an era when one out of every three movies has people shooting at people in some form, that's quite a compliment. The film is littered with clever narration and on-screen text but the use of both treads the fine line between additive and cloying.More importantly, the film has chemistry between its quartet who form a found family and the introduction of Zoey Deutch as a valley girl along with cameos by Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch are comic highlights.For someone who has no inherent attraction to the zombie genre, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and that's saying a lot.",Zombieland - Double Tap

director:Ruben Fleischer
starring: Jesse Eisenberg,Emma stone,Woody harrelson,Abigail Breslin,Zoey deutch,Avan jogia,Rosario dawson etcoverall rating 90/100Zombieland double tap reunites Tallahassee ( woddy harrelson) columbus ( Jesse Eisenberg) Wichita ( Emma stone) And little rock ( Abigail breslin) as they fight against stronger more adapt zombies. But When. Little rock leaves the group to find her own path with a group of weapons free peace lovers. Its down to the gang to try and Win little rock back and protect her from an army of zombies with some fresh faces to join them on the way. Wow what a great film. 10 years later they still nailed everything and this was actually better then the first film.First of all i loved the interactive script from Jesse Eisenbergs narration. I loved how through a lot of the script that Jesse was talking to the audience. I think that this made the humour connect more and also it made the film more enjoyable and relatable as you knew what he was thinking therefore we as audience members felt like part of the movie. This was also done in the first film but they did it better in this sequel.Next i loved the gore and creative action sequences. Just like the first film they didn't hold back with the gore with the zombies which is what the audience wanted so i am glad they didn't play it safe. And the action sequences were really creative. Where they made new and creative ways of killing the zombies. And there was even more ridiculous ways to kill the zombies as well. Including a combine harvester. And i loved that they created new zombies to keep the film fresh and entertaining. I loved the concept of the homer zombies that bought a lot of comedy and the new adapted more difficult to beat zombies. I wished they had gone more into the ninja zombies as that would of bought some more jumpscares to the film but i didn't have to much of an issue with this.Next the acting was great and i loved the development of the characters and the new characters bought some great dynamic to the movie. I thought once again Woody Harrelson,Jesse Eisenberg,Emma stone and Abigail Breslin did solid performances. Which really showed how versatile they all are and they all had fantastic comedic timing throughout. And i loved that they added more development for tallahassee with more qwerks and wanting to settle down with someone. And they went more deeper into more of Columbuses rules. The concept of Little Rock wanting to find her own path away from the gang was also another interesting concept that was explored well. And finally the new characters were great. Rosario Dawson and Avan jogia were great in there own ways as love interests for Little Rock and Tallahassee. Avan jogias role suited him perfectly and Rosario dawsons personality matched with Woddy Harrelsons in a great way as well. But the key standout out of the new characters and in my opinion the whole film has to be Zoey Deutch as Madison. Wow she suited her role as the dumb blonde perfectly. She bought the most humour to the film for me. She bought conflict into Columbus and Wichitas relationship which was well executed. And seeing her unlikely bond grow with the gang was fantastic i hope she gets more work off of this movie.Now for my two little nitpicks for the film. First of all some of the aspects of the films plot was fairly similar to the first film in places. They teased going to another island type place. Wichita did a lot of things that they she did in the first film so it almost felt copied in places. There was only a couple of small instances of this though so it didn't effect my opinion on the movie to much. And also they overused the comedy aspect of the movie slightly to much in places. Dont get me wrong this movie was hilarious which i will get onto in a minute. But it was used so much that it got a bit to over the top and a but much in places. There was a joke in pretty much every scene of the movie so it was hard to keep up and effected the impact of some of the emotional/action scenes within the film.However adding onto the previous point Zombieland 2 was still hilarious and for the most part worked. Wow this film was just a massive belly laugh. Whether it was the zombies the chemistry between the cast or just the humour being really clever and liked to todays society i laughed out loud on countless occasions in the film which was just great and this was largely why i enjoyed it slightly more then the first film. And finally the final act was fantastic. There was so many zombies attacking all the characters at the end that if often made you question the outcome of what was going to happen. it was entertaining,had you on the edge of your seat and the overall ending was very satisfying and teased a possible 3rd movie which i loved.Overall Zombieland double tap is an improvement over the first movie. With a great cast and characters. Great action and zombie concepts and despite being overused in places is one of the funniest movies of the year.",Zombieland - Double Tap

147,gavinp9,"Not as great as original, but still good fun",7,19 October 2019,"'Zombieland: Double Tap' is perhaps an unasked-for sequel, but since it's been 10 years and has the entire cast back, it doesn't feel too forced. One of the opening scenes, in slow-motion with Metallica's 'Master of puppets' playing is a great re-introduction, as is Columbus (Eisenberg)'s narration of the ""evolved"" zombies. He, Tallahassee (Harrelson), Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Breslin) are now living comfortably in the White House, but things get too comfortable and a road trip ensues.This is good, because it means new characters are introduced - the ditzy Madison (Deutch), the under-used Nevada (Dawson), and the almost-doppelgangers of Albuquerque (Wilson) and Flagstaff (Middleditch), which provide a great middle act. The stakes and horror/zombie levels aren't really too high until the final act.Still plenty of funny moments, new ""rules"" and tongue-poking at the zombie genre, while also holding true to lots of zombie-isms. Nothing too serious or groundbreaking happens, but it's a solid, mostly-fun watch throughout - and almost worth it to see Harrelson dressed as Elvis! Also, an excellent mid-credit scene too.",Zombieland - Double Tap

149,renegadeviking-271-528568,Zombieland: Double Tap review,7,25 January 2020,"Zombieland: Double Tap is once again directed by Ruben Fleischer and it is the long-awaited sequel to 2009's Zombieland. Ten Years have passed and it's become very apparent that they're all starting to get a bit tired of seeing each other everywhere, namely Little Rock who runs away with a hippie while a new herd of zombies are on the rise. Now it's up to the gang and some newcomers to get Little Rock back and kill a ton of zombies along the way. The movie stars Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, Zoey Deutch, Abigail Breslin, Avan Jogia and Rosario Dawson.Zombieland is the perfect movie for someone who likes Halloween but doesn't like scary movies. It's got the perfect amount of fun, action, heart and thrills. Ten years have passed since that first movie came out and not a lot of movies came close to being another Zombieland. Nowadays comedies are rarely successful on the big-screen and the zombie genre has been played with many times with shows like The Walking Dead and iZombie but Double Tap couldn't come during a better time, it's October and this movie is easy money. However for a sequel to a cult classic that's been ten years in the making, is this the only reason this sequel was created?Zombieland: Double Tap is a fast-paced, massively entertaining sequel which incorporates the best aspects of the first movie and still make it work, ten years later. That being said, Double Tap doesn't offer anything new when it comes to story and when it does, it never reaches it's full potential. While the cast is just as great as last time, the story is too underwhelming when it had tons of potential. It never goes beyond being a simple zombie movie. Fans of the first movie will have fun, but they won't find anything new to enjoy other than Zoey Deutch's Madison who is arguably the movie's saving grace. It's perfectly entertaining and fast-paced but by the end you are left with the feeling that it was just fine.zoey-deutch-jesse-eisenberg-zombieland-double-tap-01-600x350The movie's biggest flaw is easily the script. While the first Zombieland was known for focusing more on character than on action, the characters in this movie don't change in a drastic way which deserves a sequel, they go on with their lives in a realistic and natural way. There is rarely any time for character development because of the lightning fast pace, this movie literally goes from action scene to funny scene and back to action scene. The story presented could have gone in many different ways but instead it chooses to be a rough copy of the first movie but this time the zombies are stronger. There are literally sub-plots which not only do they not add anything to the story but they get resolved in a couple scenes, namely the doppelganger Tallahassee and Columbus sub-plot which the movie could have used in such good ways but instead it wastes them for an action scene. When it comes to the main four characters, their story does move forward but not in a way that it deserves a second movie, it's very small-scale.
zombieland-double-tap-movie-New-HD-Stills-Updated-
zombieland2_sony.0All of that being said, Double Tap offers the same fast-paced fun, gore and humour as the first one did. Because of it's fast-paced nature, the movie never has a dull moment, it's consistently moving and in doing so, it's easy to digest and just move along with whatever is happening, similar to the first movie. When it comes to humour, the cast is great however we've already seen that dynamic before, they use the same jokes and so it doesn't come off as anything fresh or new, however Deutch's Madison is incredibly funny and adds some energy to an otherwise tired dynamic. The performances are just as great as last time. I just wish the script gave them more to work with. Since we know these characters, it's very easy to predict what jokes they'll make. For example in Deadpool 2, we know the character, he's foul, loud and over-the-top but the sequel didn't just stick to that. It used slapstick, physical humour and it put the characters in much different situations than the first movie. Double Tap never leaves the first movie's comfort zone.Overall, Zombieland; Double Tap doesn't quite hit the mark. The derivative story fails to add anything new to this world and when it tries to, it wastes it and never reaches it's full potential. While the cast is great and features a standout performance from Zoey Deutch, the movie doesn't really have a reason to exist. Zombieland fans might like it and audiences will definitely have a blast but I can't imagine this movie escape being in the shadow of it's much better predecessor.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Cliche lines replace action and momentum (camera work and editing focuses on them as well, instead of the big picture).Towards the end it starts to look like a B movie as it's nearly all cliche lines, shakey camera, explosions, small goals. The camera never shows the bigger picture of the surroundings and the options available if you were in the movie, so you're left putting up with ultra zoomed in shakey cam, the most predictable one liners... looking at your watch to see if they've got any more.

So when I finally started watching this movie was definitely surprised to see how all over it was in this sense.Second-I really diddn't enjoy the ending of this movie at all.

With great delight, we can say this is the best movie of the season. We laughed and were relieved we didn't have to think like a 12 year old or listen to two hours of over-acting with a cigarette and creepy laugh. This one picks up where the original left off. One of the principal writers was from Deadpool success -- funny stuff. We laughed ... a lot! We were disappointed in lots of people having sex and not one naked boob, but at least people were getting busy. Tehre was lots of slow motion blood. There was even a monster truck!

153,WalkdenEntertainment,"Get ready to ""Nut up and shut up"" again..",7,22 October 2019,"Continuing from where we last left our 4 leading survivors 10 years ago, our leads within Zombieland have grown stronger and wiser on how to survive. But, on the flip side, the zombies which have taken over the world are also advancing, changing and transforming, becoming more of a threat to all remaining survivors on earth.The film starts with Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock moving into (what's left of) The White House. Everything seems perfect until one member is no longer happy in the group and decides to take a new path, seeking a new family. The remaining members go after her, travelling to Graceland. As they do so they will encounter many new zombies and survivors along the way.Personally I was a huge fan of the original film which featured in 2009. My favourite part of the original film was the cast themselves and the general creative humour. I'm proud to say that Zombieland: Double Tap manages to be a worthy sequel, but I will also say in advance that unfortunately it doesn't reach the review score of the original instalment. Our sequel loves to reuse jokes from the original film such as the zombie rules of surviving. Zombieland: Double Tap also manages to add new jokes which should get some laughs but at times the new gags will feel repetitive. The film's structure is also similar, using tactics such as a slow motion introduction and a big finale battle with stacks of zombies in the 3rd/final act.While the plot itself is a little simple and easy, I can't deny that I still had fun with this film. Seeing the returning characters alone and seeing them advanced (grown up) was also a nice touch for fans too. This film feels more like a celebration or reunion at times rather than witnessing a true instalment. The over the top action was also fun but I found the film's audio soundtrack slightly forgettable.Overall, while Zombieland: Double Tap isn't as strong as the original instalment in regards to plot, there's still stacks of fun to be had. Seeing the returning characters we fell in love with in 2009, with them now taking on a greater threat of zombies is welcomed and I personally found myself having a great brainless time. This film is truly welcomed and a worthy follow up for all Zombieland fans.7.1/10

154,movieman6-413-929510,"The second Zombieland is more filled with comedy and characters, but not much better than the first part.",5,19 October 2019,"Zombieland: Double Tap is the continuation of the first Zombieland film ten years later. This sequel is again directed by Ruben Fleischer.The group of four zombie apocalypse survivors have been in a world filled with zombies for ten years now. The zombies have evolved over the past ten years, requiring the group to kill new types of zombies in new ways. In these ten years, the four have also become a kind of family.
When Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) walks away in a rebellious mood and so gets lost, the others have to find her before they lose her forever in the zombie apocalypse. During this search they meet other survivors. With some of these they know how to make a friendship, while others seem to be more likely to happen. For example, they must carefully choose who they will travel with in their search for Little Rock.Although it is both in real life and the film ten years later, this sequel manages to retain the same atmosphere and style. This film is again an exaggerated comic trip during a zombie apocalypse. The problem for this film is that zombies are no longer such a special kind of horror creatures as they were in 2009. Since 2010 thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, zombies have become more popular and used more in movies and TV series. Despite the growing popularity of zombies, they still know how to use this aspect in their own comical way in this new Zombieland film. This new film knows how to remain entertaining for the fans of the first part.
The effects also look just as good as in the first film. For some new zombie species in the film, they have made this overly bloody for comic purposes. Most zombies are placed in the film with good make-up effects. Only when there is a larger group of zombies in the film, have they added the extra zombies with CGI to shed the group in this way.The acting is also as good as it was in the first part. In the ten years after the first part, many of the cast made more breakthroughs in the film world. Woody Harrelson was the best known of the cast in the first Zombieland film. His character in this film is fortunately still as wrong and politically incorrect as he was in the first part. It is nice to see that they have not adapted his character to how the modern film world works today. Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin have become more popular in the film world since 2009. Some have received Oscar nominations and winnings in their film career since 2009. It is great that they were willing to come back for this ten-year later sequel.
Many of the new characters have a more minor role in the film and seem to be more in the film for extra comic moments. Of the new cast members, Zoey Deutch delivers the best and most comical acting as the stereotype of a stupid blonde.",Zombieland - Double Tap
155,SafReviews,"Decent, but not as good as the first movie",6,27 January 2020,"I'm a bit disappointed as I was expecting this to be just as good as the first movie, but it wasn't at all. The plot was ok, however the first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie wasn't that intriguing and didn't make me feel that interested. The action scenes were good, the last action scene could've been better, but I understand that they were trying to do something different and not what the audience is expecting. There were some funny moments in the movie, but some of them felt forced and I was expecting more like in the first movie. It's a shame because I loved the first movie, but I guess this is what should be expected from sequels of good movies.",Zombieland - Double Tap
156,theromanempire-1,Even better than the first film,9,14 November 2019,"U really have to go check this out. if u liked first one u will ADORE the sequel which is even better.
great story many laughs the cast is back with a vengeance and we even got upgraded zombies.
especially first hour of the movie was a straight A grade.
the movie opens with metallica's gem hit master of puppets....do I need to say more ?
in last 30 minutes we got a few over the top excuses of what was happening but that was a minor flaw......(what happened with Maddison and the explanation as to how she was...alive was ridiculus).
the ending was also awesome.
overall if the movie is not deserve the A grade it deserves at least a B+ (9 OUT OF 10).
hope we get part 3 but not again ....in 10 years.",Zombieland - Double Tap
157,williampsamuel,"A Heartfelt, Mostly Satisfying Sequel",7,22 April 2020,"Ten years ago, Zombieland reinvented the zombie genre. Or more properly, it crossed it with the classic road movie, to hilarious and grisly effect. Now we get to see what's become of Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock ten years later, and it's a pretty fun ride.Now for those of you who didn't see the first Zombieland, those are the main characters I'm referring to, not actual cities. Also, if you didn't see the first movie, go watch it. The beginning of this one will make more sense and you'll get way more of the jokes. Anyway, the first movie was about four strangers becoming a family. This one is about what happens when that family grows up and people start moving in their own directions. Our heroes are still mostly as we remember them, but it's interesting to see how their relationships have changed and how even as they've become closer each of them is beginning to chafe and long for something different.One area where Double Tap is lacking in comparison to the original is the relative lack of gags that lampoon the zombie genre. Perhaps the numerous horror-comedies released over the past decade have mined that vein dry, but a few jokes at the expense of Resident Evil and 28 Days Later wouldn't have hurt. I was also a bit perplexed by the complete lack of twinkie jokes. Thankfully however, the Zombie Kill of the Week is still very much a thing, and our heroes' bickering is still as funny as ever. But by far the biggest laughs come from the new characters.New girl Madison is, frankly, the most basic white girl in the history of cinema. Like, so totally basic that you expect the screen to like, explode in a wave of pumpkin spice lattes. Seriously, she's as ditzy and high maintenance as Paris Hilton, if slightly more capable of feeling empathy and other human emotions. It's truly a miracle she's survived. The same could be said for fellow newcomer Berkley, who in addition to being a pacifist, vegan hippie is also the biggest poser since the guys in Green Day. Or maybe even the guys in Milli Vanilli. These two walking caricatures would be seriously annoying if they weren't so hilarious.On the other hand, Nevada (played by the one and only Rosario Dawson) is absolutely awesome. She's a zombie killing, Elvis loving, femme fatale with wit, charm, and smokin' hot looks. She's enough to make even Tallahassee rethink the whole 'loner' thing. Plus, there's also a pair of survivors who are, well, oddly reminiscent of certain people we know, from their looks to their speech to their idiosyncratic relationship.The action is as good as ever, with lots of fast paced, well-staged gunplay and fight scenes, plus enough blood and guts to remind us that this is a horror movie. There are some excellent vehicular scenes, and the filmmakers actually managed to deliver an ending that matches the manic slaughter at Pacific Playland. Hell, it may even exceed it in terms of cleverness and total insanity.Overall, Double Tap may not have the same impact that the original did, and maybe it's a little too content to follow its predecessor's formula. But still it makes for a satisfying follow up that delivers solid action, lots of laughs, and a few new twists. Plus the best mid credits scene since Deadpool 2. Really, it's that great. Stay through the ending.",Zombieland - Double Tap

It doesn't try to be anything other than a light hearted, but sometimes gory, angle on the whole zombie genre.There is no deep look at why it happened, no deep look at the issues facing survivors or looks at dark issues that may occur, it's just constant laughs as life just carries on for those humans left.There are so many plot holes and conveniences during the film it's crazy but no one really cares and this film adds no real earth shattering elements to the original but if you loved the first you will love this, which is no bad thing.",Zombieland - Double Tap

There was fun, gory action as well as hilarious gags, what more could you ask for?The main cast brought it once again, now all being high calibur actors and actresses, but still managing to recapture the sense of their characters. I did wish that Abigail Breslin's Little Rock got more to do though as she did end up being the sort of Mcguffin wit very little to do.But at the end of the day, Zombieland: Double Tap was a fun watch, very funny and very exciting to follow along the journey of Wichita, Columbus, Tallahasse and Little Rock after so many years.",Zombieland - Double Tap

The film even makes a meta reference early on as to how over run the zom-com genre already is, which kind of excuses it from that critique.

166,itsbobr,Not as Good as the 2009 Zombieland,5,22 January 2020,"A non-Zombie ""family"" headed by Tallahasse (Woody Harrelson) keep on the move to avoid Zombies, but they learn about a new strain of Zombie, the T800 who are harder to kill. Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) leaves the family to find a boy friend and the family goes to look for her.The first Zombieland movie in 2009 was really good, this one not so much. The killing of Zombies involves a tremendous use of CGI and the result is a lot of bloody gore and some of it, okay a lot of it, is hard to watch. Very cringe worthy. In the 2009 movie, I do remember that Tallahasse was always on the search for a good Twinkie, but in this one the Twinkies are never mentioned. Guess he had his fill in 2009.The family does find Little Rock in Babylon, a hippie compound, where guns are not allowed. The T800 Zombies find them and without guns how will the family and occupants of the compound fight the T800? The CGI used will show thousands of the T800 coming to storm the compound. This can't be good.Notables: Jesse Eisenberg as Columbus, Tallahasse's partner; Emma Stone as Wichita, girl friend to Columbus; Zoey Deutch as Madison, a girl the family takes to look for Little Rock; Rosario Dawson as Nevada, the proprietor of an Elvis tourist trap; Luke Wilson as Albuquerque, Nevada's friend who drives a monster truck; Avan Jogia as Berkley who takes Little Rock to Babylon.There was good dialogue in the 2009 movie, but not so much in this one. Also it seemed that the F-words were more in vogue in here. And there was no memorable lines given in here as well. Basically, this could have used some humor. However, to be fair if you like a lot of violence and bloody gore, this is watchable, but only for you.However, the acting and overall production are fairly good. Woody Harrelson is the one who sings an Elvis song at the end when the credits run. Who knew? (5/10)Violence: Yes.

168,Bertaut,"Just as funny and irreverent as the original, even if it hits all the same beats",7,5 November 2019,"The original Zombieland (2009) was something of a sleeper hit, earning over $100 million against a $24 million budget, becoming the most financially successful zombie most ever made, until it was surpassed by the asinine World War Z (2013). Smart, funny, and self-aware, it didn't take itself too seriously, and it had bucket-loads of heart, but it was hardly a film crying out for a sequel. And as time passed, it seemed more and more unlikely such a sequel would happen. However, after a decade in development hell, Zombieland: Double Tap has arrived, and boy is it one of the most unnecessary sequels I've seen in quite some time. However, as unnecessary as it is, it's also extremely enjoyable. It doesn't do a whole lot that wasn't in the original, but the irreverent sense of humour, fourth wall breaks, sharp character interactions, and, most importantly, shedloads of charm are all present and accounted for. Directed by Ruben Fleischer (who helmed the original) and written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (who wrote the original), along with Dave Callaham, Double Tap may not take too many risks, but it's a fine companion piece.10 years after the events in the first film, the quartet is still together and still getting on one another's nerves - there's the neurotic but sweet Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg doing his Jessie Eisenberg thing), the crass but caring Tallahassee (a wonderfully acerbic Woody Harrelson), the sarcastic Wichita (a dead-pan Emma Stone) and the laidback Little Rock (Abigail Breslin doing a lot with the little she's given). As we meet them, they're in the process of taking up residence in the White House - Columbus and Wichita are still a couple, but recently, she's started to wonder if perhaps their relationship is more important to him than it is to her; Little Rock is now a young woman who resents the fact that Tallahassee still treats her like she's 11; and Tallahassee, for his part, hasn't changed an iota. After Columbus proposes to Wichita (using the Hope Diamond), she and Little Rock skip town, but she returns a month later, telling the others that Little Rock ditched her and headed to a supposed zombie-free commune. And so the trio reluctantly set out to find her. Along the way, we're introduced to Madison (Zoey Deutch, who completely steals the film), a millennial bimbo who's been holed up in walk-in freezer; Berkeley (Avan Jogia), a peace-loving hippie; Nevada (Rosario Dawson), a tough-as-nails Elvis aficionado; and Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch), who are eerily similar to Tallahassee and Columbus (the reveal of which was spoiled by the trailer). There's also a new breed of zombie, which is faster, stronger, and more intelligent than the regular kind, and which can only be killed with multiple head-shots.And that's about it as far as the plot goes.Although 10 years have passed and the zombie movie landscape is very different, one of the sequel's most successful elements is that next to nothing has changed; in essence, it acknowledges the gap precisely by ignoring it. So, Columbus's opening voiceover specifically refers to the long break as he thanks us for choosing Double Tap when there is such ""a wide choice of zombie entertainment"" and Madison tells Tallahassee his catchphrase is ""very 2009"", but the film as a whole feels as if it was shot immediately after the original. Of course, this is important insofar as in the universe of the franchise, the last decade has been very different to the last decade of our reality, so the filmmakers can't layer in too many contemporary references - although Columbus does mention how ""unrealistic"" The Walking Dead comics are, there's a hilarious deconstruction of the concept of Uber, and there's a subtle allusion to Trump when Wichita sarcastically tells Tallassee he'd have brought ""a real dignity"" to the office of the presidency.This factors into the performances as well, insofar as Columbus, Tallahassee, and Wichita are all broadly similar to how they were 10 years ago. Little Rock has changed significantly, but that's as much to do with the fact that she was a child in the original and is now a young woman. This lack of character development may sound like a bad thing, but really, the familiarity of the characters and their group dynamic has its own inherent charm, we welcome it because it's familiar, with the cast essentially doing the same things they did in the original. Speaking of performances, Zoey Deutch completely owns every scene she's in. Sure, the character is clichéd as all hell and, on paper, she should be all kinds of annoying, but that she isn't, is a testament to Deutch's warm performance, finding genuine pathos amidst the perpetually peppy and cheerful high-energy ditz. She also has great chemistry with the original cast, especially Harrelson. In fact, all of the new actors have terrific chemistry, which is nice to see insofar as effortless chemistry was one of the hallmarks of the original.In terms of problems, as mentioned, the film doesn't do a whole lot that wasn't in the original - the characters, the narrative beats, the group dynamic, the humour; all are pretty much the same as the original, and for some, this will certainly be an issue. Indeed, as much as I enjoyed the film, I would have liked to see it take more risks (there's certainly nothing here to rival the inspired Bill Murray cameo). Because of this blanket similarity, there is a sense in which the sequel isn't really its own thing, it's defined primarily by what the original did rather than forging its own path, and a lot of the meta-humour only works if you know the original. Another problem is that it fails to do much with an interesting set-up, which sees women chaffing against traditional gender roles and the identities conferred on them by men. Once the gang end up on the road, this theme is pretty much forgotten (even with the introduction of Nevada, who seems more like a man's idea of what a tough woman should be than her own person). There are also more than a few clichés, primarily in relation to Madison (as blond a character as you'll ever meet) and the one-note Berkeley (a weed-smoking gun-hating hippie, who is literally introduced by way of a sitar on the soundtrack).Zombieland: Double Tap is undemanding and doesn't completely justify its existence, but it also does justice to the original, and never for one second does it take itself seriously. The effortlessness with which it slots into the original's groove is either funny in its own right or poor writing, depending on your perspective, but the film is smart enough to know and acknowledge that it feels slightly out of place in 2019. And if a little of the spark has been lost, the warmth, the characters, the jokes, and the playfulness more than make up for it.",Zombieland - Double Tap
169,homecoming8,Love the original ? - You're gonna Love This as well !,9,31 December 2019,"The surprise hit ""Zombieland"" (2009) was the american ""Shaun of the Dead"" and certainly in the same league. It's not easy to combine comedy with horror but both films were a blast. Especially Harrelson, Eisenberger and Stone were amazing.After recently watching some of the biggest disappointments and worst films of 2019 (Once Upon a time in Hollywood, Hobbs & Shaw, 6 Underground), I wasn't expecting much for this sequel 10 years (!!) after the original. Because even this years' ""It: Chapter 2"" looked pale compared to the original from 2017.Surprisingly, ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" is as good as the original. The cast and oneliners are once again hilarious, the gore is good and convincing (even if CGI was obviously involved) and the story breaks new ground. Gotta love the new characters as well.Bad reviews are mostly from people who didn't even like the original or aim at political correctness.

One reason being I never thought that a sequel was warranted, the first film stood alone by itself fine. However I recognised that with the great critical and box office reception the first film got it was inevitable that a second one was probably gonna happen at some point.I have to say that the 10 year wait actually plays into the films hands........and thankfully it is well worth the wait......it might even be better than the first film! It has everything you could want in a zombie film and a sequel. There is lots of zombie killing.......some great humour and development of the characters that we already know and love. They were the three biggest boxes the film had to get right for it to work for me............and it did it so so well. However it doesn't stop there it expands the story, introducing new characters............ which plays really really well into the comedy of the film.Overall its great acting, directing, story telling.........action packed, bloody, gory, funny and damn entertaining. It is an absolute blast in the cinema, I would find it hard to find anyone who doesn't have a good time in the cinema watching this film. This is a true modern day popcorn blockbuster.........funny, dumb whilst still being intelligent enough to give us a bit of heart and story. 70% out of 100 its everything anyone could want from a ""Zombieland"" sequel..........if you liked the first one I'd be shocked if didn't like this one.P.S All I would say is stay after the credits....................hilariously funny!!",Zombieland - Double Tap

I found it odd that 10 years later, and their characters didn't evolve one iota, except for Little Rock who of course was no longer a little girl. But you'd think that the movie set 10 years later would have seen some character growth, or a larger group, or even the whole marriage thing would have been addressed some 8 years earlier?!
When Madison shows up, it breathes life into the characters, gives them some new material. The Graceland/Elvis thing was a nice touch. But why kill off two new characters so soon? Heck, why kill off the Madison character so soon. Ugh!
Anyway, the ending is a total mess, I don't see how Rosario Dawson's character Nevada would have turned up just in the nick of time. It's not like she would have known they were in any kind of trouble. And that whole thing of running up the stairs to the top of that building, And the zombies just run past a whole bunch of people to chase Woody? And how did those Babylon people survive all these years if they keep setting off fireworks.
And that gets me to the part about the zombie types. I thought that was a bit lame. 10 years later, most of the zombies would have rotted away, not looked like they had just died. So they wouldn't be moving so fast, otherwise body parts would fall off.
So, I'm okay if they don't do another movie. The director really should have capitalized on the original by doing a sequel soon after. Maybe my mind will change on this one like it did with Anchorman 2 (which I found disappointing in the theaters, but love to watch now), and I will enjoy it on second viewing. We'll see.

It was wild, fresh and most inportantly fun thanks in large part to a great cast that made the experience memorable. Zombieland: Double Tap, brought back the entire to send them on a new adventure but sadly, the story leaves a lot more to be desired.This zombie fairy tale starts of well describing how the world has evolved in the past 10 years and the changes that came with it but in the grand scheme of things, its a pale shadow when compared to the original. They did bring in some new elements and characters that do a decent job of fitting into the narrative but ultimately, the movie fails to grasp the lightheartedness and energy of its predecessor.I am a harsh critic when it comes to zombie films but here I understand that realism should go out the window to allow the movie to be a comedy. They doubled on the jokes but half of them ended up feeling either forced or stale which prevented the movie from having a smooth flow. The cast makes this movie worth the watch as it feels like they haven't changed since 2009 making it a decent sequel to be honest, Zombieland should have been left as a standalone cult classic.Movies.shmovies on Instagram",Zombieland - Double Tap
183,hunter-friesen,"""Zombieland"" returns without brains",5,7 November 2019,"When the first ""Zombieland"" came out in 2009, it was a pleasant surprise. The zombie genre was in its initial rebirth stage and self-referential humor hadn't reached its peak just yet. It became the talk of every middle and high school around the country, creating a rabid fanbase that launched the careers for several of its stars and creators.Now ten years later, the gang is back, still making their way through the undead infestation within America. But slaughtering zombies proves to create human relationship problems, ones that the survivors all thought they left behind. Also, there's a new breed of zombie on the loose: tougher and smarter than ever before. With the physical and emotional danger ramping up by the day, the bond holding the misfit family together will soon be tested.Directed by Ruben Fleischer, helmer of the first film and Tom Hardy's ""Venom,"" ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" is a breezy 99-minute comedy. The atmosphere is light and joyous as the characters retain their sarcastic attitudes even in the most perilous of times.That carefree attitude is also a symptom of the story's lack of depth and purpose. Fleischer frames the narrative as a road movie, but without a meaningful destination or compelling journey to bring it all together. The comedy set pieces here are closer to separate entities rather than part of a whole piece.Fortunately, some of those disjointed scenes contain some great action as Fleischer embellishes in the gory fun of killing (or re-killing) the undead. Slow-motion and excessive blood and guts soak the screen and make for an amusing watch. And even though guns are the primary weapon of choice, there is one top-notch tracking shot sequence that deserves credit for its creative methods for killing.Written by the original duo of the first movie with the addition Dave Callaham, ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" still contains the same amount of self-referential humor of the first. This time though, the meta-jokes aren't as fresh and are served through overly-expository narration. Just like the carefree atmosphere, this fault is part of a larger problem: staleness.Ten years ago, this story and these characters were original. But now with ""The Walking Dead"" and umpteen amount of video games, the zombie genre has run itself into the ground. ""Zombieland"" writers don't try to solve this problem and merely just try to joke around it.That's not to say that the jokes are bad; some of them are quite good. The chemistry between the cast is just as good or even better than the original. It's just a shame that all that talent is buried under a little-to-nothing plot that only serves the purpose of shuffling them between set pieces.It's fine and all to watch the same great characters do funny stuff, but a story to tell is also necessary. The lack of a story here showcases the prime reason this film was nothing more than an unnecessary cash grab.Ten years older and all Academy Award-nominated, the cast returns to do more of the same.Jesse Eisenberg is his usual fidgety and neurotic self as he spatters out his rules of survival.Woody Harrelson takes the top spot among the group and seems to be enjoying himself the most. It's almost unfair to the others that he gets the best lines, but he makes the most out of them and is the main reason most of the jokes land.Emma Stone, away from serious roles for a little bit, also seems to be reveling in the zombie carnage. It's nice to see her let loose, especially since she does have a knack for snarky comedy.Lastly, Abigail Breslin gets the short end of the stick as she isn't given anything funny to do or say, even if she's pretty good in her scarce moments to shine.""Zombieland: Double Tap"" has some good moments, but they're not enough to make it a good movie. Still, its inoffensiveness delivers just enough laughs to service those who have fond memories of the first one.Just like how ""Ghostbusters II"" isn't remembered to this day, I feel this sequel will come and go without leaving the same lasting mark that the superior original was able to make all those years ago.",Zombieland - Double Tap

It was made 10 years later and in such movies, it feels like seeing your old friends after a long time, hence the characters become much more relatable. In addition, the cast is improved with some entertaining characters, and the script is also more compelling. Overall, this sequel is slightly better than the first.",Zombieland - Double Tap

All-in-all it stays mediocre and has some highlights for sure, but the originality of the first part is gone, even when they do a retry by the rules with another fraction of survivors. No, that didn't work. Digging out ""the King"" was ok, but didn't work either. It's ok, we were well entertained. But it wasn't a real burner. Our hopes were turned down after 1/3 of the movie. I would recommend it for fans of the first part who want to see the actors again, but please don't expect too much.",Zombieland - Double Tap
188,skullhead739,I'm grateful but saddened..,5,4 January 2020,"I wanna start by saving I absolutely love the 1st film, it's a genre of it's own and solidified a style of zombie movies. However this sequal like many others failed to live up to the greatness of the 1st film, and here's why.Plot:
The plot is bad, it truly is. They have 2 characters (a hippie and dumb blonde) that should have never been thought up and ruin the majority of the film. It's off paced from the 1st film and feels like a totally different world and director from the original. The whole movie seems like one big joke. Combined with a bad story and scenes that just seem to want to get a pity laugh from you. Only thing I liked was the idea of new zombies that are more unique. Just wished they had a plot centered around that idea and have different zombie types like in left for dead 2.Acting:
The orginal actors seem to do a good job of portraying their characters from the original with some off personality choices sometimes. However everyone else just acts terrible and makes you feel like your in a comedy with no feeling of a zombie apocalypse at all.Cinematography:
The shots and CGI are as expected (good). But there are too many moments were forced ""comedy"" scenes are put in. For example zombie kills or flashbacks, of unrelated subjects to the story.Conclusion:
I'm very disappointed in this film, but I am grateful I got a remake at all. It has a lot of problems but has nice/ funny moments in there. I really wish the make a third one with the original flare with comedy thrown in to a realistic apocolyptic world with unlikely characters and a real story. Overall watch it or dont, it's okay, but only okay.",Zombieland - Double Tap

I did like Madison, and thought she was an entertaining addition. Plus, the brain dead blonde as a second wife is traditional.
It did stretch things a bit, which brought me out of the movie in places - such as the new guys being exactly like the main guys and suddenly dying, the no guns policy as an excuse for set-pieces, and the sudden entrance of the monster truck.
It did have the best mid-credits scene ever, though.",Zombieland - Double Tap

192,EasternZZ,"It is a good zombie movie, but....",7,20 October 2019,"This movie overall is a fun ride, but it is missing that really ""epic"" moment that would had pushed this to a great zombie film. There are action scenes and they are okay, but there isn't an action scene that really stuck with me.~ I am talking about scenes like ""the propane explosion"" in Dawn Of The Dead (2004), the ""final barn battle"" in Zombi 2, the ""empty streets of London"" scene in 28 Days later, the ""circus battle"" from the original Zombieland, and so on.I feel that they could had had a very epic ending battle, but I was left disappointed because this movie really build up to having a massive zombie showdown throughout. We are told about these new type of ""Terminator Zombies"" but it never really goes beyond that.I like the comedy but there are some scenes that are stretched out too long, for example the ""doppelganger"" scene with Jessie and this dude who looks like him. It is funny at first, but it drags on a bit too long. There was also this hippie looking dude who keeps talking about ""group sex"" and it really wasn;t funny.Overall, Woody Harrelson and Emma Stone really shines in this movie, and seeing Woody sing Elvis is pretty damn awesome.Overall a 7/10 (A fun movie that just needed that one very epic scene, which it lacked)",Zombieland - Double Tap

For me, I love a good comedy. However, there's a point for me where humour becomes ridiculous. This movie crossed my threshold and then some. However, there were a few funny moments.The acting was terrible. It's the worst performance i've seen of Harrelson and Stone. Even Breslin was well below her usual standard. To be fair, Stone did say she was a new woman, so, this is probably just her new benchmark of mediocrity.There are also a few ""woke"" moments, if that's your sort of thing. ""Woke"" and low end of low-brow humour.I honestly can't think of anyone I would recommend this movie to. This is the second worst movie i've seen this year.

196,theredsky,Zombieland: Double Tap review,5,21 October 2019,"Zombieland from 2009 is a good movie that is thoroughly entertaining. So how does the sequel stand up to the original. Eh, it's okay. It's entertaining but you will probably forget about it after you see it. The film unfortunately feels way too familiar to the first to the point where you feel like it's almost a copy of the original which is unfortunate because there are some interesting new elements that they added to the film. One of those elements would be the zombie types. It's a cool idea but it doesn't go anywhere. There are two moments with the zombie types that are pretty funny but that's about it. I liked Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch's characters but they are only there for about 5 minutes and then they are gone. Those two are the only new characters I enjoyed. I found Zoey Deutch's character to be incredibly annoying. I know that's what the film was going for but she was just way too annoying. The humor was hit or miss for me. I found some of the jokes to be pretty funny while others I thought were terrible. The first Zombieland was definitely much funnier but this film does have a hilarious post credit scene with a celebrity. The one aspect that holds this film up high would be the acting and chemistry between Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin. Just from their performance and chemistry alone, you can tell that they really wanted to make this sequel. Double Tap definitely feels like a Zombieland movie even if it's a tad bit familiar. As I said earlier, 50 percent of the jokes are pretty funny. They have a segment that comes into play 2 or 3 times called Zombie Kill of the Year that is hilarious. Some of the segments in the film are really good. The opening sequence is brilliant. It's the main characters battling zombies in front of The White House with Metallica's Master of Puppets playing and it's fantastic. Another segment would be a zombie attack scene in an Elvis themed hotel. It's not a one shot take but it's made to look like one but it's great and creative which is definitely what the film needed. Double Tap is much more gory than its 2009 counterpart which is used for mostly comedic value which works most of the time. Overall, Zombieland: Double Tap has great acting and chemistry from the leads and some hilarious moments but it is a little too familiar to its 2009 counterpart and is mostly forgettable. I give Zombieland: Double Tap a 6/10.",Zombieland - Double Tap
197,pritol,"Worthy sequel, much of the same!",8,22 June 2020,"The first Zombieland film, came out at a time when there had been more than a few other zombie films released within close proximity.That being said it managed to hold its own due to its sharp dialogue, great characters, and quirky humour. The sequel is much of the same, it doesn't try and be anything different, and just continues on the good work.New characters do fit right in, although only a few are given a lot of screen time, otherwise it's just the usual main characters who dominate proceedings which is no bad thing.Sounds like a vague review, but if you want to relax with zombie comedy gold, look no further!",Zombieland - Double Tap

If I third film comes out I'll see that too. Some people just don't understand that it's only a movie, sit there and have a good time. No need to bash it for following a formula that is effective.

Zombies basically just take more shots to kill.Suspend disbelief a lot, and realize this is a comedy with Zombies in it, not a Zombie movie with some comedy. A lot of things don't make sense, even in the classic Zombie cannon. Most of the people alive in this movie are helpless pacifists, yet they're surviving? Thriving?

203,DennisBergkamp10,"Zoey Deutch is the best thing about a movie that boasts of talents like Harrelson, Eisenberg & Emma Stone.",6,27 December 2019,"If I had to rate my top 3 zombie-comedy I would go with Juan of the Dead which is my personal favourite, Zombieland & then Shaun of the Dead. This one would not even make Top 10.This one does not feel like a movie that has been 10 years in the making. Its like they sat on their asses all this while and then wrote a haphazard script in 3 weeks. If you still cannot fathom how ordinary it is, I can say that Zoey Deutch is the best thing about a movie that boasts of talents like Harrelson, Eisenberg & Emma Stone.Looks & acting skills have not been kind to Abigail Breslin. If she was not essential to the script I am sure they would have killed off her character. Credit to the writers though for making sure that she has as little screen time & dialogues as possible. This is most definitely Woody Harrelson's worst movie that I have ever watched. He just phones in a performance. If you like Jesse Eisenberg I would recommend his recent movie, The Art of Self Defense. Its an underrated gem. Emma Stone like Harrelson also didnt bother to show up.For a movie about zombies there are not many of them. There is a hippy commune with daft hippies who like to set off pyrotechnics at every given opportunity but the now smarter zombies v2.0 wait all of 10 years and select the very moment Harrelson, Stone & Eisenberg show up at the commune to launch an attack. The climax is as daft as the rest of the movie. Not much happens. Zombies fall off a high-rise. The End.The comedic relief that Zoey Deutch provides is the only redeemable thing about the movie. Its not a movie that you should necessarily avoid but it would be a good idea to keep your expectation as low as humanly possible.",Zombieland - Double Tap

The acting is mediocre, the visual effects are at a decent level. The plot, for example, is almost interesting, the plot of the film is shown in an ingenious and slightly comic way. I'm not exactly thrilled, but in any case it's better for me than the first part!",Zombieland - Double Tap

The beginning and middle of the film were setting up for a solid 3rd act but that 3rd act ended up being very disappointing. I understand the themes they were going for, but the final action sequence didn't satisfy me.The old cast is back, and they are great. Jesse, Emma, and Woody especially were a major positive for the film. Tallahassee was hilarious and they did a very good job of preserving his character from 2009. The same could be said about the other two. However, the new madison character was annoying and unneeded...I do not understand why her character got as much screen time as she did. Her character was funny for 10 minutes, but they beat a dead horse with her character. She ends up having a way bigger role than she should've had.The madison character basically ruined the film for me. With her and the disappointing 3rd act, Zombieland 2 wasn't for me.

Harrelson is still the best of the main four, but Zoey Deutch steals the show, she is just hilarious. I wish she'd been in it for the whole film. Other than her, the film is just kind of decent.

212,pal05052003,Laugh out loud funny,8,23 October 2019,"After Walking Dead fatigue, I am pleasantly surprised at how Zombieland Double Tap could be so hilarious. Or maybe it is the fatigue from watching the Walking Dead series. Whatever the reason, this follow up to Zombieland is hilarious. Woody Harrelson is great fun, and so is Emma Stone. Woody Harrelson's character could come off as annoying and grumpy, but Harrelson manages to make the character likable, and have some depth. You can see he is trying to act tough but wants to be close to his 'family', especially Abigail Breslin's character Little Rock. As for Emma Stone, I actually like Emma Stone a lot, and she manages to be funny while keeping a straight face. Her facial expressions make for great laughs. But the funniest goes Zoe Deutch, who plays a dumb blonde. Though, innocent and naive, she is quite perceptive, and manages to provide most of the laugh out loud moments. Besides that, there are other great comedic scenes, so much you forget it is a zombie movie. But as all zombie movies, it has great zombie scenes. With evolved breeds of zombies, we feel worried about the characters because the updated versions are truly relentless. There are a few particularly suspenseful moments, such as one zombie shootout scene, and a heart wrenching scene involving one of the characters. These are reminders that it is the personality and choices of how the characters see their world that makes things seem so positive, and that danger lurks everywhere in Zombieland. The pacing is good, and the movie does not waste time getting to the story. There is not a boring moment, and I agree it will not win Oscars for best performances, or story, it is absolutely great entertainment.",Zombieland - Double Tap
213,BeanieCore,How did it go this wrong?,4,29 November 2020,"It was already a risk making a sequel to ""Zombieland"" after 10 years. But I never could've predicted it would turn out this badly. Especially with the same great cast, writers and director that gave us the classic original film. But this film makes the cardinal mistake that any truly atrocious sequel does. It's nothing but a re-hashing of exactly the same story we were given 10 years ago. Even in the world of the film, 10 years have passed, but it's hard to believe that, as the characters have apparently gone through absolutely no growth whatsoever. The original film was about a group of loner misfits with severe trust issues coming together and finding family in a zombie apocalypse. And ""Double Tap"" is about the same people, 10 whole years later, doing the exact same thing. You'd think the characters would have sorted out their differences, or gone their separate ways years ago if this was still the case, but no, Wichita still can't commit to Columbus and Tallahasse still can't decide whether he wants to be brooding loner or brooding grandpa. So the entire film is framed around the characters re-learning the exact same lessons they learned 10 years ago. This is not just lazy writing, this is an active refusal to think of an original plot.A blatant cash grab, if you will, because the only thing that makes this more than a remake of the original are a slew of new jokes and comedic scenes. Sadly, the humor is massively downgraded as well, and the writers seem to have taken the ""irritating = funny"" approach this time around. Most of the humor comes from several new characters that are introduced along the way, all of whom are apparently supposed to be comical because of how unbearable and annoying they are. There's only a few moments that are effectively funny throughout the overlong runtime, most of them between Eisenberg and Harrelson, but otherwise there's absolutely nothing to see here. The film isn't funny, it disrespects it's characters by treating them as imbeciles, and the whole shebang is so transparently uncreative that the finale even takes place in an amusement park, also exactly the same as the original. This is one case where I agree with the critics, and I'm dumbfounded at the audience adoration for this steaming garbage. I've no idea how this turned out so wrong, but I can only hope the filmmakers don't further tarnish the memory of the classic original.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Whatever that magic was, it was lost here.That's not to say this movie is bad. There are some chuckles. Zoey Deutch as Madison was great, and I liked the exchanges with her, Witchita (Emma Stone) and Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg). But most of the jokes fell flat. The scenes didn't seem to flow and instead felt like a disjointed set of jokes. They brought in the concept of different types of zombies (Homers for dumb zombies, Hawkings for smart ones, T800s for strong ones) but it really didn't go anywhere. The scene with Columbus and his doppleganger Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch) started out as funny but went on for too long.Bottom line, 6/10 for me.

The movie would have been a lot better if it came out maybe 6-7 years ago but now? The Zombie fad is not only tiring it's been done to death almost every way you can imagine so it's not as engaging as when it was kind of still fresh a decade ago. I think that's what killed the movie and make it feel not so interesting as it would have been at a different time.The only think I liked about this movie was Zoey Deutch's character Madison. She made the film feel fresh and I don't think we've ever seen anyone like her in a zombie movie before. Without her character it's just another comedic zombie movie. I don't know what happened to Emma Stone she was fun and likeable in the first one but in the second one she was kind of annoying and the same goes for her male counterpart in the movie. Wichita was of course himself but I don't even think he mentioned twinkies not once. I kind of felt like they over played his character a bit.All in all it was a forgettable film kind of like the first one. There just wasn't enough to make the movie all that interesting.

Unnecessary outdated pop culture references, stereotypical characters and diversity just for adding some colour to the screen are all tolerable if there is some story in the film. That's the biggest problem of Double Tap.Ruben Fischer just wanted to cash in the hype the previous movie bought and decided to make this one. Unlike the first part there are very little zombies on screen and its more about humans we didn't want see. One would think that this is an extended episode of Gossip Girl with zombies in the backdrop. In the climax with no build up we are teased about a huge zombie fight and that is an utter disappointment to say the very least.I hope this is a lesson for directors and producers to not make everything that clicks into a franchise.

Shaun of the Dead was the first film to make fun of how preposterous and hilarious zombie films could be. Turning the genre on its head into a low budget and entertaining Zom-Rom-Com (note; I need to talk about Shaun of the Dead as it had some influence on the Zombieland series). Zombieland followed up 3 years later to rave reviews it was thoroughly entertaining poking fun at the rules followed in Zombie survival scenarios. A few of these include only 4-40 people surviving the whole zombie apocalypse (somehow) and they have to stick together in a lord of the flies scenario cough Walking Dead cough. Abandoned Playground, Action Hero Duo team Tallahassee. Almost kissed by Colombus and Big Rock etc. Going on road trips was fun in the first film, in the second it felt like I was forced into a box to see bad CGI action taking place. Finally again with Little Rock and Big Rock betraying them at every turn was entertaining in the first film but far, far less entertaining in the second film be unique be interesting don't do the same old hashed stuff again I'm so sick of it. As a fan of Elvis, I was pretty biased in liking the 30 minutes they spent making Elvis references, which would be annoying to anybody that doesn't like Elvis Presley. Please keep this in mind. The White House was pretty badass.From here on out there are spoilers (I still recommend watching the film if only for the nostalgia and final battle):
Nobody was more overtly stupid like Madison in Zombieland Doubletap whom I hated with a vengeance she ruined the film for me. She made the film feel like an awful cash-grab sequel. To a dead genre that hasn't been popular since The Walking Dead. This dumb blonde bs gave me aids add anyone else and it would've been more entertaining the worst part about the dumb blonde character is THAT PEOPLE LIKED HER PERFORMANCE. Jesus Christ Why? I'll give the film credit for being just entertaining and funny enough that I could sit through its 100-minute runtime. The ending of the film was worth the other 110 minutes of pure cringe. The amount of kills that took place in the four seasons of the Walking Dead kill numbers in 20 minutes sounds pretty cool to me. I was expecting the same thing as the last film but they somehow made it more interesting even if Tallahassee running and the zombies not looking through the holed shields and biting at the people at the top of the building makes no sense. The Crane scene was very emotional and I think I would have been sad to see Tal. died because I liked his character a lot even in this mediocre film. I would've given it a 5/10 had the ending been bad but I decided 6/10 is fine.",Zombieland - Double Tap

225,valen060,Zombieland Reigns Again with Laughs and Thrills,8,20 November 2019,"In 2009, I witnessed 'Zombieland' as a clever spin on the zombie genre by making it more of a horror comedy rather than a full-fledged horror flick. San Diego Comic-Con that year sure showed me that the violent humor blends MGM and Looney Tunes cartoon slapstick gags with real-life angst combined with survival horror conventions. Stars Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin return as the main dysfunctional family of survivors now zombie experts moving on to new territory in this funny follow-up.'Zombieland: Double Tap' offers more meta-humor (something its writers intentionally went with as they did Deadpool) and new characters the four encounter, but at least it's good to catch up with these characters in so long. For example, Tallahassee and Columbus discover doppelgängers of themselves (played by Luke Wilson and Thomas Middlemitch), only for the latter two to not be as dignified or well-rounded as them. Yes, they are exaggerated and undeniably worth some laughs. As for new character Nevada (played by Rosario Dawson) joining in on their travels? I like her for her wits. Oh, and don't get me started on Madison. She can be annoying especially to Tallahassee, but she sure has a story to tell, despite how silly it sounds.Little Rock sure has grown up during the 10-year time gap (I jokingly call her 'Big Rock') and her feelings of wanting to start her own family brings out Tallahassee's ""dad instincts"" which I see as character development. At this point, their entire world spoofs The Walking Dead, which is not bad. Rather it's fitting in the 2010s.Overall, 'Zombieland: Double Tap' really widens the scope of their universe ten years later with a new zombie type (which is slyly compared by Columbus as a T-800), some character development on the main cast, a killer (and sometimes humorous) soundtrack that appropriates their predicaments or dilemmas, a few current event references, trends, and scenarios that feel relatable in daily life, but the chemistry is the one thing I was more focused on. Not to mention four movies in a row for Harrelson and Eisenberg having costarred together since the first movie. They really have a good balance. My view on the movie turned a complete 180 at that moment and had me not lose faith in this sequel. Director Ruben Fleischer followed up really well. An adventure loaded with thrills and laughs. A must-see.",Zombieland - Double Tap

227,ajzeg,It's alright.,6,1 December 2019,"This is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 horror-comedy favourite, Zombieland. As for my thoughts on the original, it's pretty good. It's an entertaining movie with good characters and some good comedy. The ending is stupid, but aside from that I like the movie and I will rewatch it from time to time. Shaun of the Dead is better, though. As for my thoughts on the sequel, it was okay. It wasn't as good as the original, but it wasn't bad. I do think that it lost a lot of the simplicity that the original had. The original just focussed on 4 characters going on a road trip across a post-apocalyptic wasteland and seeing what they find along the way. The sequel has WAY too many characters! I also feel like the story didn't have as much of a goal as the first movie and there are a lot more stupid jokes that go on for way too long. It also feels kind of outdated. A lot of these jokes just don't seem like jokes that you should find in a movie from 2019. It kind of makes sense in the story since the world ended in 2009, but I don't know, it was a little distracting sometimes. Still, this is still recognizable as the same world with the same characters as the original. If that's all you're looking for, you'll have a good time. However, if you're looking for a great sequel that improves on the original, you're not going to find that here.",Zombieland - Double Tap
228,GavWaskett,Zombieland: Double Tap OR Don't watch when you're dead tired!,7,13 September 2020,"Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock are back and they're still avoiding being eaten by the new inhabitants of the world. It's actually a good job that this film is based in America as I don't think Woody Harrelson as Grimsby, Emma Stone as Hartlepool, Jesse Eisenberg as Snodsbury and Abigail Breslin as Little Plumpton (the last two are real names I promise - and I was going to plump for Little Cockup, but after typing it, it just felt wrong!) would have the same effect to international audiences! It'd be like Midsomer Murders has the severe case of the munchies!Anyway, I digress, they are settled down and playing happy families as we join them, but in Zombieland things never go smoothly and both Little Rock and Wichita have some issues they need to work through. Tallahassee hasn't got the depth to have issues and Columbus has issues on top of issues so he doesn't really notice what's going on around him.The story then turns into a road movie, with our heroes out to reunite with each other, avoiding the different types of Zombies, including the new super zombie, who George A Romero would've been proud of. They are joined by Zooey Deutch as Madison(I'm sure there was a film about bridges about her!), a potential love interest and typical Mallrat, more ditz than the cast of Clueless!, Rosario Dawson as ass-kicking Nevada and Luke Wilson and Thomas Middleditch as Albuquerque and Flagstaff - two more American names I dare you to find and they're characters are vaguely similar.I actually found this funnier than the first film, with more visual gags and the interactions between the characters flowed much more smoothly. They were some great death scenes and the little interludes for Zombie Deaths Competition and the Rules worked really well. It was good to see the characters and actors back together, a bit older but no wiser, they work really well together as group. And the Elvis and Bill Murray jokes hit the spot.Definitely a sequel that fleshed out the first film - a funny 15/20.

First part brought innovative zing to Zmovies, this was using the same old formula. Even then it could have been better, but it seems in the first part objective was to entertain the audience, in this it was to entertain themselves (first). I don't think Woody did a single scence without cracking up himself while shooting or was just on a 'high'er ground for the entire movie while shooting. None-the-less lose comic movie although a disappointing sequel, is a non-serious Zmovie which if you have nothing to watch can be watched to kill some time.",Zombieland - Double Tap

I know it's a fictional movie but let's have some common sense here, how is the Military of any large country not able to survive or protect a base but a bunch hippies with no weapons during a zombie apocalypse able to survive?

237,hotrobinproductions,"Not bad, but not good, for a sequel it's fine.",6,9 January 2020,"Fun movie, definitely doesn't pack the brains and charisma as the first. The jokes are hilarious but become stale as the movie goes on, and a lot they overuse or just become redundant, like the dumb blonde was funny but gets overplayed and annoying to the point where it loses the comedy, same for the little girls love interest, and it's almost like the director said we need everyone to have a love interest... it could have been much more interesting... the only interesting love interest is woody And the new actress who I think is badass. Also Jessie eisenberg Emma stone are cool and the chemistry between the drama works, it's just the blond becomes so annoying and ruins it and them getting together again just feels unearned and cliche. The movie packs a punch with everything it has. The scene where the have two twins was funny and a lot of jokes do land. The final act is very dumb and so half assed. I feel like the original had a faster ending too but it made it work within that little time and it was a shorter film than this one, however it managed to make the little time work. This movie just feels like it wants to wrap it up... and the scene where the monster truck comes in is badass however I can't ignore how dumb and out of nowhere it is for her character and PERFECT timing mind you... a 6/10 is not bad. I wouldn't mind or care for watching this movie again but if I watch Zombieland I wouldn't mind putting this on after to get a few laughs and fall asleep later. Fun movie just lacks the punches and impact of the first. Not bad but not good enough, and I guess it doesn't have to be. Still good as far as sequels go.",Zombieland - Double Tap

239,Kirollos-Noah,Delightful,7,9 November 2019,"Zombieland: Double Tap is directed by Ruben Fleischer, same director of the first movie, and written by Dave Callaham, Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, And starring Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin.Zombieland: Double Tap takes place a decade after the first one, and in the sequel the four slayers must face off against the many new kinds of zombies that have evolved since the first movie, as well as some new human survivors. But most of all, they have to face the growing pains of their own snarky, makeshift family.Zombieland was a great movie, I think it's one of the best zombie-comedies, it was really funny, and well-crafted with amazing performances and great cameos!Zland: Double Tap is another fun movie to add to the first one, it's still funny, charismatic, has good cameos and some cool zombie-sequences.The performances are great, everyone gave a great performance, all the new characters are welcome, but Breslin on the other hand isn't that good as she was in the first one, she's by far my least favorite part of this movie, I think she did a bad job in this movie, but fortunately she doesn't have lots of scenes as she did in the first one.Madison's character, played by Zoey Deutch, is that dumb character that could annoy some people, she's so cliched, but still she has some fine laughs during the movie, but most of her screen-time, I couldn't help it, I was so annoyed of her character.This movie is as simple as the first one was, and that's really good, because what made the first so one a cult classic, is that it wasn't serious nor grim, it was simple, funny and violent... The plot, which is a subplot in other movies, is delightful, it was really good to see them all reunited again on the big screen!Woody Harrelson is once again the MVP of this movie, just like how he was in the first movie, he's so funny and his character is still the one that has depth, even if it's lower than what we saw in the first one, but it's still so good to see that character again, and to see how they developed him, because sadly, there isn't that much of development in this movie over the first one when it comes to characters, there's even another runaway from the same characters, but I loved what they did to Tallahassee, and I'm so happy to see more of him!Fleischer did another great job directing this movie, he made some cool shots, for instance, there's a shot when a couple of moneybags were shot, and money started to flew in the air, and the character just passed beside it and didn't care, because it's Zombieland, what could money do to them? I think he really did a great job capturing this apocalyptic world, just like how he did in the first movie.There isn't really that much to say about a movie like this, it's just a zombie-comedy movie, and it did that really well, but it's not as cohesive as the first one, nor as good as it was, but still really enjoyable!The reason why the first one works better than this one is that the first one wasn't that much about zombies, they were there, but the movie focused more on our 4 main characters, and showed us how they're acting during those situations, this one here, cared more about zombies, and it gave them more character than what we needed.When it comes to flaws, beside the stuff I said above, I think it's not as sick, weird or silly as the first one was, it got a little bit self-aware, and that's not what we wanted to see from a zombie-comedy.Still Zombieland: Double Tap is a an enjoyable movie, if you liked the first one you would probably enjoy yourself in this one too, even though I would watch the first one over this one.I'm gonna give Zombieland: Double Tap a B.Thank you, guys as always for reading my reviews, and if you liked this, you can click on my name up above and see all of my reviews.",Zombieland - Double Tap

It has more and better characters, some are really crazy! Talahassee and Columbus are such a good team man, I'm in awe! They are two of the finest when they come together, especially, Talahassee. It's very adventurous, every character justifies their role pretty well. And yes, the zombies have evolved! That's the first sentence movie starts with.

244,helenbassett,Zombieland 2: Double Tap Film Review - Ruben Fleischer Directs The Fastest Gunslingers in The US Hilariously Taking On The Zombie Acropolis For The Second Time,10,4 November 2019,"Hands up I never saw the original Zombieland, but what a blast Double Tap is. The whole cinema was roaring with laughter. Director Ruben Fleischer takes his four gunslingers and upgrades their accommodation, it's the White House baby. Just a little pruning in the garden first. The zombies have also had an upgrade. Categorised from Homer to Hawking, Ninja and T-800s. Damm they're hard to kill, even with double-tap.Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee is Commander in Chief in the newly requisitioned White House, queue the music, and Abigail Breslin is the unhappy First Daughter. Little Rock is looking for more excitement with kids her own age. Difficult in a zombie apocalypse. But there's always Christmas (any day you like), and Lincoln doesn't need his gun anymore (I think it was his), so Tallahassee gifts it to Little Rock. And her sister Wichita played by Emma Stone gets no less than the Hope diamond as an engagement ring from Jesse Eisenberg's Columbus. Love is sweet.But things don't always go to plan and the boys find themselves alone when the girls split, and fancying a little retail therapy one day. Columbus loves candles, of course he does, and of all the candle departments in all the world wanders Madison. Played by Zoey Deutch in pink, she has survived the 'acropolis' by living in a freezer and being blonde. Because zombies eat brains says Tallahassee. Ouch. She's a scream. And she and Columbus hit it off. Tallahassee not so much.But in all horror movies there's always a bang in the night, (or several going on upstairs in the Lincoln bedroom), as Wichita comes back for more guns. Maybe she thought her and Columbus were on a break, when she meets Madison. But she's back now because Little Rock has gone off with a musician hippie called Berkely to live in a peace loving commune called Babylon. Avan Jogia is gorgeous but sprinkling patchouli oil and passing Bob Dylan songs off as his own will not stop the zombie hordes. And Tallahassee is not happy he's a musician, that gag never gets old, so the gang (plus Madison, sans luggage) need to saddle up and rescue Little Rock. Even from herself.It's hilarious with snappy one liners and crazy zombie comic book kills. And the best Zombie Kill of the Year is the Leaning Tower of Pisa. What a roll. The minivan ride not so much as Little Rock took Tallahassee's motor; the Presidential Beast. But the destination is Memphis and Graceland. And Tallahassee is a huge fan. En-route Madison may take a hit for the team with trail mix, but she'll show up again.And for Gone With The Wind fans Gracelands now looks like Twelve Oaks after Sherman rode through. But there is a little motel nearby that doubles as an Elvis museum, and sweet, the Beast is parked outside. Little Rock and Berkely are gone but inside are the mythical blue suede shoes that fit Columbus just so. But Tallahassee looks cool in white. It's run by Rosario Dawson's badass Nevada, she's a big fan of the King. And she has some friends. Her ex Luke Wilson's Albuquerque and his side kick Flagstaff, played by Thomas Middleditch, are the Ross and Russ to Tallahassee and Columbus. As Wichita stays on the side line. But those new T-800's are ferocious little buggers who just won't stay down. Bit like the new Rev-9 of the future! Elvis would turn in his grave at the carnage.But after tearful goodbyes, eventually our would be rescuers arrive at Babylon, where crazily all guns are melted down. And seeing that Little Rock wants to stay Tallahassee decides to head out West and find his true Indian self. Just as our hippies are celebrating with fireworks. They always draw a crowd..of zombies. So armed with nothing, Tallahassee turns around the minivan for one heroic last stand with hippies versus the zombies.There may have been some mean spirited Venom from critics, that's twice then! But the A-list actors looked like they were having a ball. As a standalone film it was fantastic fun, it was easy to pick up the storyline! and I loved the goofy horror and screen bullet points. Chung-hoon Chung created a great zombie wasteland with Martin Whist's production design. Great job.",Zombieland - Double Tap

248,Exiled_Universe,WAY BETTER THAN EXPECTED!!!,10,17 February 2020,"SO let me just say that this was WAY better than i thought it was gonna be. I heard that it might be a ripoff of just boring but it really wasn't and i really liked it. I never saw the original but my parents did and thats another reason they liked the movie because they liked the original, i only remember seeing it a lot on TV back in 2009-2010 when i was like 7, and i didnt bother watching the original, this was kinda just for the purpose that this was a new movie and it was in theaters and all that so i knew it had to be at least OK. So now after seeing it there was a LOT that i really liked about this movie and im gonna make this review kind of a long one. First off there is an insane amount of sarcasm and jokes in this which i find funny and cool. Also there really is no story it all kinda just blends together and takes you along with it which i found interesting and something that dosent really happen in movies that much especially nowadays. This is one of those movies where you wont forget about it and its just sticks with you its not like it was boring is what im trying to say. There are also a lot of cool scenes in this like the RV shootout or the house fight or the monster truck scene which is by far the best part of the movie because it was so incredible i was just like wow dude, all the scenes are good. I feel like there really wasn't that many zombie encounters here, i mean there were a handful but i feel like maybe one for could make it prefect. The acting and all the performances were great and i loved everything about this movie and the reason im giving this a 10 is because well i dont really have any complaints and theres really nothing bad i have to say about it. The post credits scene was weird but cool. I really liked what this movie went for and i dont know if there will be a 3rd installment one day but all i know is i will definitely see it :D",Zombieland - Double Tap
249,c-kelsall,Let's play 'Name That Zombie'!,7,31 October 2019,"A lot of people might wonder whether Zombieland needed a sequel, 10 years on. That's a fair question for most movie franchises, and maybe the long gap was needed to come up with sufficiently fresh material. Did they succeed? Mostly, I'd say they did.
A sequel is a tricky beast to get right, because it has to bring something new, but it can't tear up the formula and throw it out of the window. I enjoyed Double Tap as much as the first film, although a few of the jokes were a little over-used in DT, and I don't remember getting that feeling from Zombieland. However, there were some good new additions to the Zombieverse in the form of evolved zombies, much more dangerous than the originals, and some amusing characters not seen before. Zoey Deutch was note-perfect as the airhead Californian girl, Madison. It's scary that people like her really exist!
The whole thing is, of course, played for laughs, and I was kept entertained for the full run time, except for the (in my opinion) entirely superfluous peri-credits flashback sequence in a media studio. I like Bill Murray as much as anyone, but DT really didn't need him; it was a long time to wait for not very much in that respect.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Yes zombie films are usually shallow blood fests with thin plots and polar opposite characters trying to survive their circumstances together in close quarters trusting each other with their lives and then throw in the reality check that brings on the drama or comedy or romance.....for at the heart of every great film is a love story and this one is no different. The problem lies with a completely rediculous plot, rushed script, and unbelievable characters. Even a lot of the dialog seemed forced and out of character. The actors tried their best but the script was a very heavy weight to lift no matter how talented they are. So while this was still a fun watch, I had to rate it only a 6, which is just a watchable movie on my scale.

The characters are attaching and reliable. There is a lot of humor, which is well handled most of the time. Great cast. Woody Harrelson kills it, as usual.
It is the kind of sequel that I tolerate because the difference of quality with the original is not very large. I think it is not a useful but worthy sequel and given the base material, that's the best I personally could hope.",Zombieland - Double Tap

258,rustonreviews,A welcome surprise.,7,7 November 2019,"Late sequels are always risky business. Ten years off the heels of one of the most successful horror/comedy flicks of the 2000's, the long awaited arrival of Zombieland: Double Tap was always going to be something of a gamble. Humour has certainly changed in the ten years since Zombieland's release in 2009, and zombies, for the most part anyway, appear to have run their course within pop culture. Just look at The Walking Dead's (2010-) dwindling viewing figures for one example of viewers losing interest in undead entertainment. Picking up ten years after the original film, Columbus (Eisenberg), Tallahassee (Harrelson), Wichita (Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) have been fighting off zombie hordes for ten years and have found their own private haven within the abandoned White House. With dynamics continuously shifting between the group, their loyalty is subsequently put to the test amidst the discovery of a new breed of evolved zombie.Walking out of Zombieland: Double Tap, I was pleasantly surprised. As is the case with the original film, the chemistry shared between the four primary cast members stands as one of the films strongest elements, but it's newcomer Zoey Deutch who steals the show as Madison, a ditzy blonde somehow still surviving in zombieland. Deutch brings most of the laughs (often at her own characters expense), and integrates effectively enough amongst the rest of the cast. You'd be forgiven for believing her character would grow annoying fast, but she proves to be the most welcome addition out of all the new characters brought into the fold. What's also relatively commendable is the fact that Fleischer has remembered how to direct a feature film after his misguided efforts on Venom (2018). Just like its predecessor, Double Tap serves up a healthy dosage of gory headshots and ravenous undead action, but there's still nothing here to rival the levels of excessive blood and guts present within a Romero or Fulci zombie film. When it comes to the narrative itself, it doesn't come across as though ten years have passed for the characters themselves. Judging by their actions and interactions with one another, it feels like a year or so has passed rather than a whole decade, resulting in a first act that can come across as a little jarring once the central plot kicks into gear. Still, the film does what it has to do to get the plot moving, even if it doesn't feel as organic as it could be. Nevertheless, Zombieland: Double Tap is another fun effort that stands shoulder to shoulder with its acclaimed predecessor; a rare accomplishment for a late sequel.",Zombieland - Double Tap

(*I never saw first film so this is seen without that reference*)The Zombocomedy Satire of black and dry humour ~ barbs, puns relying on those relationships --all whilst--
buttons are pushed, tollerances are tested, and boundaries are stomped on.
Newbies join the needy foursome, which adds comic relief and refresh the isolated jaded team who live with each other bc up to now they had no other.Some times the humour digs among themselves is exaggerated bc they are easy whiney targets bc they know each other's buttons, which they relentlessly push to get under each other's skin to show their love kinship and repressed feelings.
They truly are fond of each other, stuck with each other, though the pretence is they just tolerate each other. But they always know they are a team.There is lots of zombie slapstick action kills to satisfy all snickering bogey-hunter-fans. Blood like black gold texas tea, comes bubbling, spewing, spurting out of exploding zombies as they are hacked and riddled with bullets. Action enthusiasts will be delighted.Stay after the credits for a very funny cameo outtake.The writers do the job of a script soley relying on the cabin fever talkie banter, many egg-on-the-face close-ups, and twerking overtime on the actors give-me-a-break self deprecatory moody characters.
Everyone is set up in rotation as the attacker, victim, straight guy and fall guy irrespectively and gets a chance to be the butt of a joke or the joker. Which makes every situation fair game.
There are a lot of fun and funny times, like a very long SNL skit. No one is safe or superior.
Also, everyone's got comedic tragic flaws, which plays out well when a few of the self-hyped-out characters literally get to see themselves thru their own twin eyes...(nuff said, without making a spoiler.)Finally, it is an entertaining comedy with a grade of B.
I mean it's a zombie-com,
it's got zombie in the title...you can't expect Streep. Although Streep as a zombie, or zombie bounty hunter would make a great film, cause you know She make it Oscar worthy. (IE Buffy, Lincoln)Oh one final moral of the story warning:
""Leave your place you lose your space"", in someone's heart in the real world and especially more so amongst apocalypsic trysts so:
""Love the one your with!""Now who should see this, for focus groups:

Funny and doesn't try too hard, though sometimes Woody Harrelson and Luke Wilson do, but gets loads of laughs anyway, It was good but not nearly as good as the first one. If I give 6.5/10
But the characters are still lovable and we still care for them. And Metallica still in the opening action scenes, which was good.Even though the negatives did not make this movie as perfect as the first one, it is still watchable if you're willing to shut down your brain for the evening, kick back, and enjoy with an open mind.",Zombieland - Double Tap
264,Ingrouille181,Best thing going for this movie was the trailer,6,23 November 2019,"I liked the trailer for Zombieland: Double Tap. ""Academy award winner Jesse Eisenberg"", ""Academy award winner Emma Stone""; the movie knows what it is, a sequel to the hilarious Zombie sleeper hit Zombieland. They could've easily made the sequel the year after the first one, but it feels special when the sequel comes out 10 years after the first. We know these characters, and we're interested to see where the characters have gone and how they've grown over the span of 10 years.All the actors still do a great job, but I don't think the script gave them anything great to do. It's fun seeing how Little Rock's come into her own and wants to branch out, and how Columbus and Wichita's relationship has grown, a standard continuation of that stuff, and Woody Harrelson's Tallahassee's great as usual, he elevates things. And I like the addition of stronger zombies in this world 10 years on that are harder to kill. But we've seen all that before, and a lot of this movie feels like it's going through the motions. The character I was interested in the most was Zoey Deutch's character Maddison; I thought she'd be the comic relief dumb blonde but she's more than that by the end. The end of the movie is like the ending of the first one.I give it six mainly because there are things here and there that make this more than the standard sequel it comes off like. If you're looking for the long awaited T2 sequel to the first Zombieland movie, this just isn't it. I don't know if it's the budget, or the script, but this isn't the sequel we were waiting for, just wasn't.6 out of 10",Zombieland - Double Tap

The whole ""Little Rock running off with the hippie"" storyline kind of killed it for me, also, there were a lot of repeated jokes and catchphrases that just aren't as impactful the second time around.

The flick makes excellent use of its cast to portray a deadpool-esque version of the zombie apocalypse that engrosses the viewer in all of its funny quirks and vices. While the film does get to a slow start, and some of its jokes do not quite land the punch in the beginning, it picks up pace later on with the jokes equally being better as well.

Now I see why it took them nearly 10 years to make this sequel... they didn't have any ideas for where the story should go.As it turns out... 10 years later and they still didn't have a solid continuation to this story. There are a few funny ha-ha moments but for the most part, this movie is immediately forgettable.The zombie-genre needs something fresh. The Walking Dead has really ran the genre into the ground. We don't want to watch people going from place to place over and over and over again.The only reason I'm giving this movie 2 instead of 1 is because of Woody.

282,its-me6611,Fun but pointless,7,25 December 2019,7/10Zombieland: Double Tap is a very unsatisfying watch mostly because it has no story or direction. It feels like a filler episode of a show. Don't have high expectations.Plot: Little Rock runs away because she wants to get laid. The gang is worried about her so they set out to find her.First I want to point out the bad things and get them out of the way. First is Wichita (Emma Stone). She has one expression for the most part of the film. She looks like she was being forced to be in the film. Very distracting. Second is the lack of events. Nothing happens.The film does have few good points. Some of the things are really well done. Comedy being one of them. There are lots of laugh out loud moments. The comic timing is amazing. The chemistry between Tallahassee and Columbus still amazing.Tallahassee is amazing and reminded me of the charm of the first film. Columbus is invisible most of the time but still deliver with his nerdy likable approach. The best character is hands down Madison (Zoey Deutch). She is so good. Laughed so much thanks to her. Some of the best moments of the film is due to her character. She deserves a standalone film of her own. Another character that is super funny is Civil War Bearded Guy played by Victor Rivera.Zombieland: Double Tap has some really funny moments and cool zombie kills. Some of the characters acts so good that some stand out like a sore thumb. It is definitely recommended for one time watch but don't have high expectations.,Zombieland - Double Tap

New characters are introduced but they are cliche, and didn't bring much to the story other than to provide a lackluster way to add more depth to characters that you do not want to see have love interest in a world run by Zombies. This is a sequel that is more like Predator 2 and little like T2...just unenthusiastic. After 10 years, one would think some unique ideas would have been offered.

285,michaeldoud,First Hit: There are some wonderfully funny moments in this zombie spoof.,9,20 October 2019,"First Hit: There are some wonderfully funny moments in this zombie spoof.Ten years after the original Zombieland, the same characters are back, older, wiser, and ready to take on the ever-evolving zombies. To this end, the team talks about the three different types of zombies, but then they learn about the high powered zombies.Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Columbus (Jessie Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone), and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) are still roaming the eastern part of the United States, taking what they want, living where they want, and killing all the Zombies that come their way.The women are struggling with the men. Little Rock is feeling out of sorts because she's running around with adults, and she would like to find people her own age. Wichita is feeling pressured by Columbus to get married. Adding to the women's misery, Tallahassee thinks he's the boss of this motley crew and spends most of his time tinkering with The Beast, the Gatling gun protected car.Deciding to take residence in the White House, things coming to a head. Little Rock and Wichita steal The Beast and leave a cryptic note for the men saying ""so long.""Wichita and Little Rock run into a young hippy they call Berkeley (Avan Jogia), who is a pacifist guitar-playing guy looking for Babylon. A place he says, where no guns allowed, and the compound is walled off to protect the residents from the zombies.Columbus runs into Madison (Zoey Deutch) at a mall that he and Tallahassee are pilfering. She's a dumb blonde who has been living in a freezer that keeps her safe from the zombies. She goes back to the White House with him and seduces him.Little Rock leaves her sister Wichita to run off with Berkeley in search of Graceland and then maybe Babylon. Alone, Wichita comes back to the White House to ask Tallahassee and Columbus to help her find her younger sister. But as soon as she gets there, she confronts Columbus for sleeping with Madison so quickly after she had left.Deciding to stay together, they head out to find Little Rock, fearing she's making a mistake. The journey has them killing lots of zombies on their way to Graceland, thinking that is where Little Rock was headed. After seeing Graceland empty, they find the church of Elvis and find Nevada (Rosario Dawson) running the joint, alone. Ready to rest before heading out again, The Beast is run over and crushed by a monster truck driven by Albuquerque (Luke Wilson) and Flagstaff (Thomas Middleditch).With Albuquerque and Flagstaff acting just like Tallahassee and Columbus, respectively, there are moments of great full-throated laughs through the one-ups-man-ship of these four guys. The back and forth is priceless.The theme of this film is outrageous fun through gags and props. Some of the accessories are; The Beast, the suburban van, the motorhome, Babylon (pronounced by Madison as ""Baby lon""), and who killed Bill Murray. Murray is shown in the opening minutes of the ending credits, stay for this. Even Elvis gets his due in this film.Harrelson is hilarious. He uses sincere looks while going through his mood swings. But the underlying smirk of amusement and self-deprecating humor makes his performance thoroughly enjoyable. Eisenberg was excellent as the semi-cautious list-making member of this crew. Stone is terrific as Eisenberg's love interest and older sister to Little Rock. Breslin has physically changed more than anyone of the other actors in this crew because she was very young in the original film. She carried her scenes with strength. Deutch was so much fun as the dumb blonde. She made this role work exceptionally well, and I enjoyed her as an addition to this team. Dawson was beautiful as the proprietor of the church of Elvis. Wilson and Middleditch were great as memes of Harrelson and Eisenberg respectively. The swagger of Wilson and the nerdiness of Middleditch were correctly done. Jogla, as Berkeley, the hippie, was OK. I just didn't think he brought the same level of humor and fun to his role. Murray, in the credits, was excellent. Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Dave Callahan wrote a fun script. They didn't try to make it too close to the first film and just let the fun be expressed in this one. Ruben Fleischer did an excellent job of directing this film with a loose fun-filled feel while keeping the story logical and moving.Overall: This film was a great follow-up to the original.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Once again, there was a lot of funny moments and great action. The plot was good too. The music score was just like the first one with some great rock songs. I liked some of the settings they used such as The White House, The Hound Dog Hotel and Babylon. Also, I loved how there were a lot of great references to the first film.In terms of characters, Tallahassee, Columbus, Wichita and Little Rock were all great as usual.

Little Rock, being so much younger 10 years ago, has changed quite a bit, and that naturally helps drive some of the plot. It's a pretty good movie for anybody who liked the first Zombieland.

Although that's not a fair way to rank a movie from an objective standpoint, I was still actually pleasantly surprised by this movie.Yes, the first one is far superior. What the first Zombieland accomplished was a creative spin at a point in time when the zombie market had yet to be completely oversaturated with the Walking Dead hype. That is, I think all of us were much more receptive and open to receive a movie about zombies during 2009 than a decade later.With that detail accounted for, the first Zombieland is still funnier, more entertaining, less predictable, and more creative when compared to all of the previous zom-com attempts before it. Shaun of the Dead being an exception because it's a masterpiece.But this one wasn't irredeemable. I laughed a few times at the more subtle jokes. The overall comedic level wasn't quite there on a consistent basis, and the action felt purposefully cliche, but there were fun segments that covered the price of admission ($1.90 from Redox).Not too shabby for a movie I figured I'd turn off halfway through.",Zombieland - Double Tap

All the actors in this and yeah this includes you Woody, and all the film crew should be thrown in a wide deep ditch and then let the zombies fall in and eat them all and then cover up the hole and pretend none of this ever happened. I'm so sick of zombies, saturation in over drive. Zombie movies should be outlawed. What an irritating little prick Eisenberg is in this movie (and most all of his others to tell the truth). Man I wanted to strangle that dude watching this movie. How boring can a zombie movie possibly be? None more than this one. This has to rank up there as one of the worst movies I've ever seen it's that bad. Of course here on IMDb, the idiots run in with scores of 10 for this movie. Surprise surprise. Some idiots come in here and hand out 10's like it's candy. Woody and Eisenberg should have turned into zombies and ate each other's brains at the end of this atrocious movie (with slow motion close ups) and have been done with it. I'm mad I even sat through this even with as much fast forwarding as I did. They should have paid me to watch this.

I have to say Zombieland 2 was not at the same level, the humour seemed quite forced, like trying to be cool, and also a bad copy of the first version. The actors thought that their only presence would make the movie great, but it wasn't, you can see a lack of passion in the acting as well, not to mention the incorporation of the blondie, it was a total disaster, a wrong character's choice. More at the end the movie gets a bit better, but it sum it is a big ""NO"" to the directors/producers, and ""thank you, but we don't want a Zombieland 3"".",Zombieland - Double Tap

The new character played by duetch was used properly, if they over used her it would have been extremely annoying but they did that well. The comedy is again done very well, all the jokes are actually funny. They bring the zombie killings back and raise the bar for creative kills. The Bill Murray credit scene is great. I dislike the returning storyline of Emma Stones character being untrusting and afraid of commitment, felt like it was resolved in the last film so it didn't make sense to have it here. They introduction to the new types of zombies was cool but they didn't use them that much, so it felt wasted.Overall a fun time that lives up to the first.

306,imjaredross,A Welcomed Return to Zland,7,19 November 2019,"Zombieland: Double Tap is a sequel I never actually thought we would get. Talks of a sequel have been in the works for years and with the eventual announcement of this film I wondered to myself if it was too little too late for a sequel. I was wrong. Though Double Tap never feels as fresh as its predecessor it is still an entertaining zombie romp that brings back the beloved characters in a always entertaining, but ultimately unnecessary sequel.Taking place several years after the events of the first film the gang has finally settled down in their new life and have to deal with each other more than any sort of zombie attack. What impressed me with Zombieland Double Tap was how it's humor still managed to be extremely funny and clever just like the first film. The actors don't skip a beat and it was really nice to see Abigail Breslin once again who really hasn't been doing much for the past few years.The action, the jokes, the characters, they're all here and just as good as you remember them. The only problem with this film may be some of its more episodic nature, mainly feeling like a story that's just meandering until the climax. Also it just feels a bit familiar with nothing really new to dad to this series.Overall, I enjoyed my return to Zombieland. The comedy and characters make this a welcomed return even though it ultimately feels unnecessary in the end.

first that irritated me and I couldn't put my finger on what it was. Just leaving the theater, I knew there was an itch about the movie I couldn't scratch.Watching Zombieland: Double Tap, I now know what it was. The one note, monotone performance of Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg, who is famous, or infamous for playing the same person in every movie himself. Highly annoying, high functioning, rapid talking, autistic smart alec. The director of Double Tap really gave Jesse all the screen time in this, and it is just grating to watch.
Can't act, has no sense of humor. Every line comes off like a Dwight insult directed at Jim from The Office. No Originality. I am not a fan of If's and But's.

You'd probably think there would be more people around in the beginning than many years later.Anyways it is a relatively satisfying sequel to the first film.",Zombieland - Double Tap
326,chasemykleby,Just as great as the first Zombieland.,8,19 October 2019,"""Zombieland Double Tap"" Review
(8/10)
Making a sequel to a hit movie is hard enough. Making a sequel to a movie that went on to be considered something of a cult classic is even harder. Fortunately, for those of you who only want to know whether Zombieland: Double Tap is as good as the first, the answer is, just as great as the first Zombieland.
While it has been a long wait to reunite with Columbus, Tallahassee, Wichita, and Little Rock, the time is right, and the results are wildly satisfying, picking up 10 years after the first film. Once again, the original cast works together flawlessly, and the schtick and chemistry are no less engaging or entertaining. Every single one of them nails it, but snarky Stone is a particular delight. That said, Zombieland: Double Tap belongs to newcomer Zoey Deutch. Her performance as Madison is absolute comedy gold and uniquely her. It is worth the price of admission on its own. How she makes a character that should be insanely annoying so utterly irresistible is genius.
Recapturing, replicating, and improving on everything the original movie brought to the table was never going to be easy. However, director Ruben Fleischer and the film's writers have succeeded where others have failed with sequels to great original movies. Zombieland: Double Tap is a more than worthy sequel and companion piece to the original movie. It licks along at a brisk pace, which ensures that it is tight, lean, and the laughs and thrills come thick and fast.
Zombieland: Double Tap is two hours of occasionally gruesome diversion that didn't force me to think too hard, with a lot of callbacks to a film, and a time, that I kind of miss. (If you decide to go see it, stick around for a mid-credits sequence that evokes one of the original film's most famous moments.)",Zombieland - Double Tap
327,davidjkobb,Better Than the First,7,28 October 2019,"I might be in the minority, but I think Double Tap was better than the first Zombieland. I thought the writing was more clever, and the dumb blonde character added a lot of quality comedic bits. There's still some flaws that carry over from the first, such as thinking ""Nut up or shut up"" is funny. It's not prudishness that makes me not like that line, it just isn't funny. It's like the writer thought saying something slightly vulgar is the same thing as saying something funny. The movie has a few of these sophomoric takes on ""humor"", but mostly the comedy hits. The story has some plot holes, but you don't go to Zombieland: Double Tap for Citizen Cane. An enjoyable, albeti forgettable movie.",Zombieland - Double Tap
328,RanDizzle1198,Good but pales in comparison,7,16 October 2019,"I laughed a bit with this film but to be honest, the only time I laughed out loud fully was even before the opening credits during the Columbia Pictures intro with your statue of Liberty. That was funny/cute.While I found the film highly entertaining, it truly pales in comparison to the first but that's to be expected since that's usually the case. I may have been expecting too much since I was overly excited for this sequel so while I was slightly disappointed, I'm positive many of you will thoroughly enjoy this long awaited follow up. For me, I just wish it had a tad more substance and laughs like the first did. Again, I was going in with high expectations and overly excited so I am possibly the worst to give an opinion. I do love the films and hope for a third. I think once I sign off from here, I'll rewatch the first instalment again. I do hope you enjoy and if you go into this without the super high expectations I had, I just know you'll be pleased. It WAS like x-mad morning and a terrific gift for all of us fans.

334,strizbiz-99429,Not as good as the first but ended up enjoying most of it,8,24 December 2019,"Ok, so the first Zombieland pretty much tells you the state of things and what's going on in the world, it's been taken over by zombies, and introduced you to the four main characters. The sequel doesn't break any new ground, it pretty much picks up with the main characters years later and how they're getting along in a world with zombies. Pretty much like the first, there's some gruesome zombie killing going on. We do get to meet some new characters along the way, and I have to admit in her own way, Zoey Deutch nearly steals the movie, or at least add humor to a movie that isn't as funny as the first one. I probably wouldn't have felt like it was worth going to see it in a theater, But I rented it and could rewind and watch the kills which was cool.

We laughed and laughed! Old and new characters were fabulous, and Zoey Deutch all but stole the show as Madison. Ten years since the last? How did I wait? But that wait was worth it.

The original movie, Zombieland will go down as a classic. The writing was brilliant and I felt a connection with the characters. The writing and screenplay was alive.Zombieland 2 is what happens when the spirit of the original is dead but the movie still brought back to life for a sequel. It IS a zombie.While the original movie, like great music, was made for people with a soul and a mind, who typically feel lonely and have a strong longing for belonging but are generally and repeatedly misunderstood and mistreated. The whole point of Zombieland was that it was an allegory for the rapidly deteriorating dystopian world. I always thought Zombieland was a little ahead of its time in 2009; I related to it, but many other did not. Most people have caught up to the original movie by 2017. It is very clear we live in Zombieland, metaphorically speaking of course.That is high praise for the original, so what about this sequel?
Sigh...damn mediocre idiot writers, no brains, no soul, nothing. A lot of noise and motion, but no substance .. yeah, it's a Zombie.So, in conclusion, avoid this sequel like you would avoid a Zombie.

However why on earth they decided to make a movie about whatever the name of Abigail's Breslin, I mean the story wasn't interesting at all, all that potential goes begging and wasted so easily because of the story.

The action scenes are great, the kills and gore are great to. The plot is ok but I was abit disappointed with the direction the movie went in, its almost like the story was breathed for the teenage fans! But the characters and action are so good that it's easily overlooked. I hope there is a 3rd movie to finish the franchise and if they do, I hope they steer it back abit to be more like the 1st.

350,Krush_Burner,Same light-hearted zombie horror action as before,7,16 October 2019,"It took quite long to make a sequel to 'Zombieland', but patience is definitely rewarded. There's not much new stuff here, but that's not the point - cast and mood is the point. The great chemistry between all the main characters is still working, and make you want to see more, no matter what they do, discussing the relationships status, strolling across the deserted mall, or killing zombies.
Of course, there's something new. First of all, there's several new kinds of zombies. Then, new location of 'Babylon Tower' (inhabited by hippies) serves as the battlefield for the final clash with an army of improved undeads. Plus, a couple of new characters are added, and they're pretty much fits the story. Oh, and Bill Murray is here too, don't go away after the end credits roll.
However, all those additions seem to be just a minor elements, since the heart of 'Zombieland: Double Tap' is the characters and good, smash, bloody action. Its not about SFX or tricky plot twists, its about people killing zombies, talking about their Iives and trying to survive.",Zombieland - Double Tap
351,manubhatt3,"Better than the original; develops and moves on, excellently over it!",8,21 October 2019,"I have seen the first part. Rated it 6. There are very few movies, which excel over the original/first part, and this is one of them.
Hell, I can even recommend someone to watch the first part, just so that he can enjoy this movie!
I didn't like the jokes very much in the first part, but I very much appreciate the way this movie develops on the same jokes.",Zombieland - Double Tap
352,Mfbarry-90-773507,The chemistry is undeniable,6,18 December 2019,"The original is one of my favorites of all time...I love ""Zombieland,"" never tire of it and although I liked the idea of a sequel I was also ok without one. The sophomore curse is a real thing and if it ain't broke why fix it? Well, good news is the sequel doesn't embarrass itself. There's plenty of laughs, some unexpected shocks and, of course, the original four continue to be one of the greatest casting coups of all time. It's what brought the original to a level of greatness and what keeps this from falling into a black pit of sequelitis. I would really love to see the OG four continue to do more, but different, movies together. Becoming a ""Hope & Crosby"" or Marx Bros for the new millennium. Chemistry like this is rare and can't be planned or bought. It would be really great to see them do a polical comedy or , better yet, a heist film. (They'll almost achieved this with ""Now you see me"" but really suffered from the lack of Breslyn and Stone.)
What this movie suffers from is that some where between the original and ""Venom"" director Fliescher forgot how to tell a complete story. ""ZDT"" is like a series of great ideas strung together. There's no real follow thru storyline just a bunch of funny skits or set pieces hung together. They are all pretty good skits or set pieces but you'd get just as much out of watching this in 10 or 20 minute chunks as you do in watching the whole thing all at once. It's a terrific movie for those who like to text on the phone or play a game while they are watching at home.
Fans, like myself, will enjoy catching up with our favorite ensemble of zombie hunters but there could have been so much more meat to it.
Now if someone in Hollywood would just smarten up and put these four in another movie together they'd have a guaranteed box office hit. (I wonder if that chemistry would work in drama too) Action, comedy...hell, An action-comedy, GUARANTEED.",Zombieland - Double Tap

The chemistry of the cast (old and new) is highly entertaining. There's an ""ease"" with these performances at this point that make these characters so likable.

358,chrisrowe-97677,How do you review nothing?,5,1 January 2020,"Firstly I'd preface this with saying Jesse eisenberg is just awful. His voice is possibly the worst for narration I've ever heard, poor delivery and just wrong. He is severely unlikeable throughout. He has no depth and seemed to just coast along.Emma and woody were brilliant in everything. Supporting cast and cameos were great to. I'm unsure on abigail breslin, she appeared in poor shape (not body shaming just feel for a movie you'd make an effort, live how you want imo but for the film it just looked odd) plus her voice was Barry white deep, acting wise she was Terrible or clichéd throughout and felt like the film were loyal but she'd be far better recast. She just didn't seem interested at all.So onto the film, I enjoyed the first one, this one however I can't say either way, didn't hate it but didn't enjoy it, was extremely shallow, dull script and very little action bar a couple of scenes. I just felt that the poor acting from half of each pair, abigail and jese really let the film down.Money grabbing sequel if honest, dead in the water and a third would be ridiculous without major changes.Don't pay to see this but worth watching on free TV if bored",Zombieland - Double Tap
359,jc-999-591106,"Lots of Laughs, Awesome Action and Acting",9,4 November 2019,"I really surprisingly enjoyed this one, would like to give it an 8.5 so I gave it a 9. Woody and Jesse were great throughout, the ladies were also awesome. The story zoomed along with lots of little twists and turns.

362,adamlennard,Great fun.,10,2 November 2019,"This is movie is just great fun. There's no deep meaning or anything like that so if you're more inclined towards arty cinema this isn't for you. It does what a good B type horror movie should (a B horror film with a fairly decent budget yes) it doesn't take itself too seriously, the violence is so over the top that it's funny not disturbing and some cheesy one liners too. Woody Harrelson is the definitely the MVP of the film as he can't switch from quite serious to goofy in a heartbeat.

363,shanemoose-88715,Still enjoying the little things...,7,18 October 2019,"This is a sequel for fans of the first 'Zombieland', simple as that. It's not here to try and persuade mainstream critics into actually liking a Horror movie, not to make a statement on society, or give you a glimpse into the director and/or writers' state of mind. It's here to say, ""Sorry we kept you all waiting, now let's get back to business!"" That business being zombie gore, gross-out gags, cheesy one-liners, and jokes about men who drive minivans. The main four actors give it their all and have fun as they slip back into their beloved roles and some of the new additions are a treat. The only downside is that it's mostly the same old song and dance. Of course, it all depends on whether or not you enjoyed the first movie. If you did, then I'm confident that you'll enjoy this one immensely.",Zombieland - Double Tap

And it more or less lived upto the crazy, fun and enjoyable tidbits of the original. It isn't different from the original and hit the same beats but does slightly change up the formula just a little to keep the concept fresh. It also stays with the timeperiod with stereotypical 2019 tropes like dumb blondes, hippie pacifist and other PC stuffs that has taken over the world.

This movie is really fun because of all the scenarios, hanging out in the White House, going to Graceland, scavenging at the mall, using a sword owned by Eisenhower.
I think Madison is a really great new character, she is supposed to be this typical dumb blonde, but she is actually quite layered. Her character adds a bit of femininity and sweetness in a horror action movie.
Overall, this movie is funny and action packed, a good blend of action,horror and comedy. The pacing is perfect, none of the dialogue was redundant, the acting is ok, Abigail Breslin didn't improve much as an actor.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Well quite a lot as it happens, I thought the film was ok in parts with the zombies and stuff and some of the jokes are funny but with everything now a days creativity is stunted by pleasing everyone and ticking the boxes which is a real shame.I found some of the dialogue just completely stupid and again ticking the boxes so as not to offend anyone or everyone.

389,gustavobacelar-64245,Recycled ideas,8,3 April 2020,"The film is not far from its predecessor because it continues with the same black humor, the signs that appear during the film to complement a joke, and that, for the most part, are characteristic for using and abusing American culture. Completely American jokes. The characters already established in the first film do not deliver anything new here. Little Rock, who was supposed to be the protagonist, was the most unlikely of the cast in this film. Its plot attributed nothing to the story and served only as an objective for the locomotion of the other characters in the film. Wichita, Tallahassee and Columbus continue their interactions with acid dialogues and jokes, but they trust and protect each other much more than in the first film - a fraternal friendship - a family. The highlight of this film goes to the character Madison. She is a character with generic characteristics who could easily fall into sameness and irritate the audience who would watch her, yet she manages to do the opposite. She is generic, but she manages to be captivating, funny and makes us miss her when she leaves the scene. The other new characters presented here are not so relevant and serve only as obvious solutions for some situations and other times just to fill a gap in the film. I didn't really like them very much. Zombieland: Double Tap can be quite fun with your scenes in slow motion and with your repeated proposal from the first film. It is a pleasure to watch this film in your spare time.",Zombieland - Double Tap

391,pixfarina,A Zombie death rather than a Zombie franchise,2,6 December 2020,"I liked Zombieland one a lot. It was fun. However 'Zombieland: Double tap' is really awful. Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg reprise their roles from the first movie, but nothing has really changed, and the problem starts exactly there.The gags this time are lame and the only arc is the predictably with which these weak gags are launched and flop (without even raising a wry smile). Many of the subplots in 'Double Tap' have been done before, and done far better. Even the actors seem as half committed and the script writers apparently were.Whereas the first Zombieland relied on a backdrop of incongruities in a Zombie infested America, Double tap fails to build on that and instead (despite probably a decent budget) produces something more a kin to low budget episodes of made for TV zombie fare. Attempts to deliver anything gritty in terms of story or genre points are subverted just to keep the threadbare plot alive. It's a hard watch and the film struggles to fill its allotted time. It is unsatisfying on every level and hard to see who this was aimed at. Zombie fans will not be impressed and no one else will be either.If the makers of Double tap had done a better job they may have even got to make a third or fourth in a series. As it is anyone who has not see the first installment will be put off trying to see it by Double Tap, which is a pity. Few films would actually benefit by being half as long as they are, but 'Zombieland: Double Tap' is certainly one of them. Don't waste your time.",Zombieland - Double Tap
392,spidermonkeycoleman,"Funnier, but not quite better than the first",8,6 September 2021,"Zombieland will arguably go down as a classic from the early 2000s, and this movie tries to live up to that. They almost achieve that, but still miss the mark.As mentioned, I found this to be funnier than the first film. Maybe that's just me, but I loved the comedy in this one. However, this movie isn't as emotional or character driven as the first Zombieland, and thats mostly what brings the movie down for me.While the first Zombieland focuses on all 4 characters, this movie mostly focuses on Columbus and Witchita (is that how you spell it?) and their relationship. While that's not bad, they spend little time adding to Tallahassee and Little Rock's characters. They get their own story arcs but they don't really go anywhere.Zoey Deutch is the scene stealer in this movie. She is way too good at playing an idiot and most of her scenes are elevated by her. The rest of the cast has solid acting as well. It wasn't Oscar worthy or anything, but were good.To wrap it up, it's funny and has a good cast. Good pacing and fun action sequences.

Overall, it fell well short of hopes and expectations by being low-brow, cheesy, and containing too many entirely nonsensical aspects. On the latter, how any self-respecting writer could ever have thought that including a character like Madison was a good idea is beyond me.

However I thought Double-Tap surpassed it, delivering a fresh script, new laughs and additional characters, while still retaining the warmth of the love-hate friendship from the main four leads. The gore treads a fine line between being gratuitous and comic but never takes itself too seriously so that you are never confused about the essence of the film. There is some great comedy, delivered by some fine likeable performers, just keeping the right side of absurd. Definitely a film I could watch again.",Zombieland - Double Tap
410,kieronboote-134-969472,"10 years in the making, must have taken 10 minutes in the writing!! (warning review contains a lot of spoilers)",3,22 December 2019,"What a lifeless, charmless, reactionary, rip off and a waste of time this film is.
Unlike the first film there is very little warmth or humour in the film, just mean-spirited comments aimed at the new character Madison (played by Zoey Deutch). The other young people in the film are shown to be hippy-drippy, apart from the one who is smart enough to stash away a gun obviously! Did the NRA sponsor this movie?
Plot developments are signposted as clearly as the ""rules "" and may as well be up on the screen as soon as they occur e.g. Tallahassee is part Indian and they used to herd buffalo over cliffs. Hhmmmnn I wonder if they will herd some zombies later? No one is allowed to take a gun into the hippy camp. Hhmmnn I wonder if someone will magically unveil one just in the nick of time? Hey someone has a Monster truck ( really something that probably does one mile to the gallon is the vehicle of choice in the postapocalyptic world?) . Hhmmmnn I wonder if that will appear later? Guns, Elvis, monster trucks and comments such as ""God Bless rednecks"" just about sums up this move is aimed at.
Plot devices are ripped off from other films. The joke about claiming to write old songs from ""Goldmember"", the meeting up with identical groupings from ""Sean of the Dead"", evolving zombies from ""Day of the Dead"" etc (although these ""T1000 zombies"" are about as threatening as a basket of kittens and are easily dispensed with. )
Jesse Eisenberg shows that he really is a pretty one note actor with the screen presence of a lettuce, Emma Stone is wasted, Woody tries his best and what on earth an intelligent lady like Rosario Dawson is doing in this ( other than picking up a pay check and meeting an audience ) I have no idea?
The screenwriters were Rhett Reese, who was involved with the ""Deadpool"" movies so I would have expected more but looking at the cv of the other writer, Dave Callahan, he seems to have been consistently involved in dispiriting, pointless, multiplex fodder so I guess a lot of the blame lies at his door.
I really enjoyed the first ""Zombieland"" movie because of the character interaction and the great Bill Murray set piece but this is like a Michael Bay film, occasionally thinks blow up, shots are fired, there is no tension, no character development, no point and then it ends........",Zombieland - Double Tap

On watching this for the first time I was very disappointed compared to the first movie. Dont get me wrong it is not a bad movie but the story line was weak as if the people that wrote it were just looking for a forced reason to get everyone back on the road.Its worth a watch as it does have some good bits but just dont expect it to be anywhere near as good as the original.",Zombieland - Double Tap

You can switch out the zombies with crazy people or hippies and it will still be the same impact : boring.

But instead, threw it all away for a boring, senseless plot.OK. It will be easier and quicker to point out what I like instead.The 3 points is for Madison. She's so unbelievable that it's funny.

414,jessefelt,"Not as good as the first one, but not bad at all.",8,26 December 2019,"In a lot of ways, Zombieland: Double Tap feels like it's trying a bit too hard. There is a real sense of ""we have to out do the last one"" at times and the addition of so many new characters can result in a somewhat crowded feeling to the cast.
Two characters in particular are so one dimensionally cliche (something that the first film managed to avoid) that I have to wonder why they weren't given a bit more depth to make their inclusion feel a bit more important.
That being said, I do not feel like these ruin the film so much as lower its overall appeal just a little.Technically speaking, the film is well made, well directed, well acted and well written, just as the first film was. Nothing felt jarring, like often happens when a sequel tries to move away from the prior film(s) stylistically. Everything was competently done, though I wouldn't expect any awards. The film doesn't really do anything new or interesting, and can feel like it's simply retreading the previous film, but it delivers on the same entertainment value of some quite funny moments mixed with some very real feelings of suspense for the characters.It was nice to feel like the characters were in danger. This is something that can only really be done with properties like this that aren't part of a massive universe or extended canon where you know that the main characters are protected by plot armor. With a film like this there may easily never be another sequel, so it is much easier to get away with killing off major characters. The payoff to this sense of danger is much stronger empathy with the characters.Ultimately, I would give this film a 7/10, however I gave it 8 simply to combat some of the ridiculous 1/10 scores (very very few films deserve a 1. Even fewer films deserve a 10).",Zombieland - Double Tap

Funny, good film.The problem with having all the character complete their arks in a story, of course, is that means the story is over. You'd need to be a genius to capture that same buildup, again, after that;Anyone could tell you, a sequel was a bad idea, from the start, for that simple reason.Then they dug it up, because money, and made a sequel. Every character gets a hamfisted new ark and none of it works. It's not funny, the cast seems tired and uninspired and who can blame them?

It's like they made this movie with the same formula they used to make the first but forgot about what made the first so fresh and original. The cast is back and there are some new characters, but mostly when moments of levity occur, jokes are very stale and off putting, like someone trying too hard to make you laugh.

429,UnculturedGeek,Lots Of Fun In Zombie Comedy,7,21 February 2020,"Zombieland: Double Tap, is about a group of people trying to survive the Zombie Apocalypse. I don't watch many zombie movies, but this seems like a very basic storyline for this type of movie. The violence in the film is what makes it good. It can sometimes be funny when they kill zombies, since it is so absurd, you just randomly laugh out loud. Besides that, there are many jokes that refer to the first one (for example: The famous Bill Murray scene), and they do show how Bill Murray got introduced to the Zombie Apocalypse in the end credits. Other jokes include a new character, Madison, who is supposed to be a clueless, dumb, spoiled girl stereotype, which they use as a good running joke. They also introduce new types of zombies in the movie. One of my personal favorites, ""The Homer."" The Homer is a lazy type of zombie who is pretty much completely harmless. The character in the film is only shown about 3 or 4 times, but it is still hilarious. Moving on, the main threat in the movie is the T-800 (named after the Terminator), which is a specific zombie type that is harder to kill. In the end of the movie, massive amounts of T-800 come to eat brains. In conclusion, Zombieland is a great movie about teamwork and comedy. There is one last thing I want to add. This movie, I would recommend for ages 12+, depending on how well your child can handle violence and language. There is not much sex in it, but they do occasionally drop an innuendo bomb, and characters do sleep with each other. Moaning is heard. Besides that, the movie is a good film that you can enjoy with teens and possibly older kids.",Zombieland - Double Tap

431,tothmartin,A near perfect bloody sequel,9,26 December 2019,"Zombieland: Double Tap is the sequel of Zombieland (2009) which was a hit among audiences and critics alike. The original movie was a zombie movie with a comedy twist put into it is DNA creating an original and funny film. The characters were charming and funny, the gore and the action was great and the jokes were spot on. What do we got in the sequel? Double of it as the name suggests? Much more, I think. You see, Zombieland: Double Tap is a rare gem across movie sequels. This film is made with love and care from a director who's biggest hit was the original movie so he tried his best to make this one also entertaining. The action is really great, the jokes are still spot on with a little meta touch and the film is bloody as hell. It introduces some world building for some potential sequels but never really suggests that there is Zombieland 3 in the works, but I would really love the idea of it. Zombieland: Double Tap is everything what I wanted from sequels this year that I could not get from movies like Terminator: Dark Fate. I would recommend this movie to everyone who liked the original Zombieland but if you are not familiar with it, you can enjoy it by itself without the 2009 original but you will miss out some of the jokes along the way.",Zombieland - Double Tap
432,chorizoman,dorky is the new black,1,29 July 2020,"Why is Jesse Eisenberg so popular as an actor, certainly not because he is found funny, I may assume? Maybe young people want to adopt that clumsy, introverted behavior of his? Isn't he the image of the brilliant student, the perfect son-in-law? In my eyes he is an annoyingly creepy snot, that should not be on screen ever! There is a big difference between pretending to be funny and being funny. I find it painful to watch Woody Harrelson adjust to the childlike level of the rest, trying to be funny. Most children's movies have more substance and adult humor than this cheap pulp. What a disappointment compared to the first Zombieland-movie!
What happened to fantastic ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Abigail Breslin? Emma Stone isn't exactly the type that can bring laughter either.
I don't understand why this movie scores almost a 7! Is it because for a lot of people it is enjoying to watch the extremely gory and sadistic way of slaughtering other people (in the form of zombies to make it politically permissible)? Then, why not just sign up for the army and experience it life, serving as cannon meat for your country?

435,ueltomas,"Dumb, everything's a joke, three chuckles.",3,21 August 2020,"Can finally watch for ""free"" on skymovies. First impression was the zombie types and it seemed promising, new and different threats. Nope. Homer is dumber than a normal zombie, Hawking is okay, not even used, and seeing as he spent most of his life in a wheelchair being faster than Homer doesn't fit the name, just go Einstien as least he had working legs. Then we have Ninja which is quite literally any zombie in the dark, it's not a type, again not used.
All this does is open the possibility for one! Just one true new zombie, the T-800, which is slightly more resilient to bullets. Yay. Very creative. But still dumb enough to be led off the top of a tall building instead of getting through a feeble shield wall in the finale.
The only conflict is not with the zombies but melodramatic stuff about puppy love and marriage. A love triangle thing develops with a comedic, dumb blonde side character.
So many callbacks to the rules...
Low brow humour, no conflict that doesn't feel forced, no stakes to care about. And everything is resolved in a minute of talking. In a world full of vicous monsters to contend with 89% of the runtime is snarky, referential dialogue between stale characters, two of them literally copy and pasted.",Zombieland - Double Tap

The movie does not seem necessary at all, the story is so poorly and rushed written, like really? The little girl, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), who is a teen now feels like she needs to get out of a safe shelter in a zombie apocalypse just because she wants a boyfriend, and later on they break up anyway which was really the point of it all in the first place, Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) finds a girlfriend (Rosario Dawson) for the sake of him having one like his partner (Jesse Eisenberg). Then when they again, reached a safe place, he decides that he wants to leave only to come back 5 minutes later in movie because a horde of zombies is attacking them, which they almost die to, but then suddenly Nevada appearing with a Monster Truck saving then from the zombies with the last minute hero clyche. Anyway the movie is at least saved by the comedy that these actors are offering here and there. The really useless character Madison (Zoey Deutch) which represents a stupid girl in the zombie apocalypse, is just put in the movie for some humor that is not even funny, and likely more useless and not needed which pretty much ruins the bond that the movie makes between Wichita (Emma Stone) and Columbus in the first movie. This is just a poor sequel of a succes in the first Zombieland movie. I personally don't really recommend the movie but as I said the humor saves it here and there, and I can't decide at what things are the people going to watch, but it's pretty much a waste of time.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Zombieland 2 is one of those movies that makes me wish someone had invented a way to unmake a movie--as if it had never happened, erased from the universal consciousness. Like the third ""The Mummy"" movie or that last Indiana Jones with that nutcase Shia Labeouf. Or any of the Terminator movies after the second one. Yes, this movie was that disappointing. Nothing fresh, nothing new, just a pale imitation of the first one. Everyone seemed like they were phoning it in.
And how believable is it that the group dynamic hadn't changed at all in TEN YEARS? The two lovebirds hadn't progressed at all. The kid had obviously grown up, but not into someone likeable, rather into a fat, sulky, slightly stupid woman. Her sister looked like she was in her forties, so tired and creased. And why do these sisters not have the same name? Did they grow up and live in different cities before the zombie apocalypse? If not, then they should both have the same city name. Columbus has lost his quirk and Tallahassee just screams profanities and breaks stuff a lot. No funny here. No quirky here. Not even the classification of different zombie types was particularly funny.
One of the more unlikeable plot points was the inclusion of the Tallahassee and Columbus clones. What was their point? They could have been removed from the movie altogether and it wouldn't have mattered. Did Luke Wilson just beg to be in the movie and they said ""Okay, we'll make up this stupid, pointless character who only lasts about fifteen minutes. Ham it up and make the most of your time.

But the waiting was worth it, because Double Tap is good as well as the first part. And I'll tell you why.First of all are action scenes. There are a lot of them and they are very cool. And the addition in the form of classical rock makes them very memorable.Secondly, humor. It is very specific, but for me, without exaggeration, this is one of the funniest films of this year. And already the first 10 seconds set the right tone and make it clear what you're going to watch.Yes, the second parts are more difficult to subdue the viewer, because they are initially devoid of the effect of novelty. And the only logical way to overcome this barrier is to saturate a familiar and even secondary idea with as many internal smaller ideas as possible. And this movie takes this opportunity to the full. Do you like old stuff? Here it is and even with a new development. Want something new? Here come a new classification of zombies and new ways of killing them.All of the above does not mean that absolutely everyone will like the movie because no matter how well and professionally the director made his own picture there is still taste preferences of the audience.

It had that straight-to-dvd feel to it. There was zero character building and the plot was not very engaging. The story moves quick enough to not keep you bored though.

It has some funny jokes sprinkled over it, but the character Madison kind of ruins it and this movie would have definitely been better off without her.

461,ricemuscle,7.5 really good sequel,8,19 October 2019,"I really enjoyed this movie. Sometimes equals really fall flat and while I do not agree that it was better than the original, I thought it was a great follow up. There were a lot of throwback to the original movie but not too much to where they were relying on Old storylines to make it good. I didn't find the opening sequence to be as good as the original but it was awesome as well. More Metallica and slow mo. There was a lot of zombie action and some great special effects. I really enjoyed how they talk about walking dead and zombie movies. The Running gag with the van was very entertaining. I definitely predicted the peanut allergy although I did think she was dead and that was a nice surprise. One thing that I don't like about these movies is there's not enough human fatalities. The original one had Bill Murray getting shot and the opening sequence showing some deaths but even though it's a comedy I would like to have seen some more human getting eaten. Nothing crazy, but just some stuff thrown in here and there. I found the hippies to be really annoying and would have really liked to see a few of them die and get eaten. There was a lot of edge of your seat action and plenty of Comedy. The post credits scene was phenomenal. I didn't like the climax anywhere near as much as the climax in the original but all in all I was definitely not disappointed. I would put it a little bit under the original but I think it's definitely worth seeing and my only regret is that I watched it at home on my fire stick instead of going to the theater.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Woody's nothing new here and Emma is totally underscore and the character she plays doesn't promote very well. Zoey on the other hand in my opinion stands out the most!

Anyway back to the flick. It was Oooookay-ish.Woody towed the film to the end, Columbus was off the pace, or maybe the act is a bit passé and predictable. The hippy, the bimbo didn't really cut it and the monster truck taking out the hordes of undead, was a was like a moment out of Banana Splits! the script was too light to honour the first instalment, which I though was a pretty solid flick.

And it tells you it's for smarter audiences, the ones that know how to say apocalypse (at least, not necessarily spell it). Also, most scenes end just at the right moment, before you could start thinking :""Oh, come on!"" (Test showing it to test audience during production, or just common sense director?).

And look how easy it is, to give all main characters a simple arc.Also the action itself is not over the top and is filmed in a way that the audience knows what is going on at any time. If there is CGI action then isn't noticible, which is a thing I like.So in a nutshell: if you found the latest Terminator movie insulting or just plain bad in any way, then go watch this movie, it is money well spend.So why only 8 stars? Well, I am still holding up the same standards I had 20 years ago. Back then I would have said a funny, solid, enjoyabld action movie.

Many have been saying this movie isn't as fresh or original as the first one, but that's actually ok. There's a kind of continuity that is comforting here, however this time there was some self-awareness thrown in that allowed the film to show it definitely didn't take itself seriously.

485,Ottodane,A highly disappointing exercise in WASTED POTENTIAL. More below,4,21 October 2019,"(Disclaimer: there are no outright or direct spoilers in this review, but there are plot summaries and hints to occurrences in the film that one might interpret as a spoiler. I try to be careful but read at your own risk. There isn't much to spoil here anyways, trust me)A mere decade after the original Zombieland graced our screens, the old team of director, cast and writers have returned with a long overdue, yet not so awaited sequel. I mean let's face it, when we all first saw the trailer for Zombieland Double Tap (ZLDT from here on,) we raised our eyebrows and got maybe a little giddy or excited, with the most common following reaction being, ""huh... why though?"" As beloved and quoted as the first film was, people were not clamoring for more. Why? Because it was perfect just the way it was.Zombieland was original, (at least at the time,) crude and violent in a hilarious way, well paced and sequenced, and with characters that are easy to root for, played by great actors with impeccable comedic timing. It had some genuinely golden and memorable jokes and comedic sequences. I mean Bill Murray is almost as well known for his brief cameo role in that movie than any other work he has done! (More on that later)
Everyone was on their A game for that first movie, and as a result, they caught lightning in a bottle...So why did they think that after ten years they could just get away with such a mediocre mess as ZLDT??I will start with what I did like. For one, Woody Harrelson really brings it home once again with his lovable, rough and rugged Tallahassee. The character himself, however, has changed a bit. He is a lot more sentimental and almost ""dad like"" in the sequel, especially with Little Rock, now played by an adult Abigail Breslin, who feels suffocated by Tallahassee.Speaking of overbearing and clingy, Jesse Eisenberg's Columbus is becoming a bit too attached to Emma Stone's Wichita, causing the girls to want to split from the group. Little Rock then finds a young Musician named Berkeley and runs off with him, kicking off the plot of the movie. Emma Stone seemed to be having fun but not taking anything too seriously . But she's always good so even her worse stuff is still pretty damn great. There are some pretty funny jokes that made me laugh quietly, I think a couple made me belly laugh.There is a pretty incredible long shot that covers about 3 or so minutes of nonstop Zombie action. This scene takes place indoors, moving in and out of several different rooms and including some fantastic stunt work. Easily the second best part of the movie, right after the mid credits scene. Yeah, you read that right, the mid credit scene is better and funnier than anything else in the entire movie, and the worst part is that it is basically an extension of the best joke from the first movie. Instead of making up something that memorable this time around, they just took their most beloved joke from the original and added on to it (albeit very well.)The new blonde bimbo type girl named Madison was actually somehow not like nails on a chalkboard the entire movie. She was quite funny at times and I didn't really mind her. There are some other newcomers, like the carbon copies of our male protagonists. When I saw them in the trailer, I rolled my eyes pretty hard. It just seemed like a really tired, annoying joke... and it was in the movie. But without spoiling anything, I'll just say they weren't in the film for quite as long as I expected.If it's sounding like I'm talking about the bad now, I guess it's cause I think that really was all I liked about the movie. So on with the bad!Jesse Eisenberg delivers a very sub par performance here. He never once felt truly in character. At all. Just Jesse Eisenberg saying lines. He is not at all the same character.The plot is so thin, it is actually about one thing the entire time. Find Little Rock, make sure sure is safe, and maybe punch Berkeley in the face if there is time. That was it. So we just driving and talking and driving and talking. You get pit stop after pit stop of ""oh she's not here but there is someone else here who might be able to help us"" over and over again for nearly two hours. And the movie is just not nearly funny enough to justify its own existence. There is nothing new here.I think the most egregious part of the whole thing, as mentioned in my header, there is a tremendous amount of wasted potential. They set up possible story threads that go nowhere, tease you with deaths or consequences that would add a layer of weight and danger to the film that it desperately needed, but they pull out and never go through with it. Structurally, it seems like we might be going somewhere at some points, but then the movie continues and you find out it's just a bunch of scenes that have no consequence over the other, that are just thrown together in no particular order it seems, to make a product that just doesn't even feel like a movie. It feels like a couple filler episodes of a Zombieland TV show. There was a lot here that could have made it special, but this director has a talent for wasting potential, and he has done it again. I would have rated it lower if it weren't for some strong moments of heart, comedy and fun, and that long shot I mentioned earlier adds a whole star on its own. I would skip this one, people. Till next time.",Zombieland - Double Tap

a comedy/action movie like Zombieland to be on the same level of that of American Beauty or The Usual Suspects for example. Nor do I expect the creators to reinvent the wheel.Probably for that reason I, unlike some other reviewers, loved Zombieland: Double Tap. In this movie we reunite with our beloved characters a decade later. We follow them along when they enter a new phase in their lives. Besides their personal development we also encounter new type of zombies, new people and amazing new places.Besides a different storyline and other new things,they've also included (almost) everything we loved about Zombieland 1 into the movie.From the best kills to the rules on how to survive.All in all I really enjoyed this movie.

It's kinda live action of every video game zombies I ever played. Fun, Gory and entertaining. Yet so simple. But there some problems from this movie that losing its charm for me:Plus:
The cast still the same and continuity of 1st Zombie land movie still there. The story is still simple but enjoyable to follow. The rules still there, the pop culture reference is there, the new zombie type introduction is good.Action scene still on point, not as much as the 1st movie but still good.CGI gore still on point, Zombies design isn't really change but isn't degraded at all.I hate Madison at first but really liked her at the end. Sad that she didn't really join the crew at the ending.Many said Little Rock suddenly fat at white house after living there is annoys them, but its kinda realistic. She should be adventurous with Wichita but being kept by Tallahassee and Columbus she become lazy. Plus fat. It's realistic she's fed up and tried to run away, she's teen ofc.Minus:
I noticed is, almost no BGM. Idk why its really quiet in certain moments that should be more uplifting rock music or classic music can be inserted but not. The final battle is pretty much zombie groaning and destroyed things. It's make the movie boring in home theater.What's up with zombie killing of the year that badly realistic and inserted in not really good timing? Idk its truly annoying and waste of time.What's up also with Tallahassee and Columbus clone? Those 2 people isn't necessary and kinda wasting time introducing them. No progression of characters or story at all. Only when they turn into zombies, those cinematic fight is enjoyable..The Babylon surely fast enough to heed Tallahassee warning, and obey him without any questions. It's making them unnecessary and lifeless, better remove those kill of the year and T and C clones scene to detailing Babylon culture, even adding how LR and the drug musician love story. Their breakup also stupid and rushed.The final battle is disappointment, it's seems new zombies isn't matter other than the t-800 that also killed easily like normal zombies in last fight. So what's the point introducing new zombies type at intro? Also they just mindlessly thrown from top floor just like that, why it's not the first strategy? Instead wasting gasoline and sweat plus monster car?Elvis Presley isn't glorified enough like Bill Murray did. So I Think the creator regret killing him from the 1st movie and added that epilogue as redemption?Overall, I'ts disappointing sequel for me.

Those two characters were so unbelievably unbearable I almost walked out. The only thing I could think is that they were there to make us never demand another Zland movie.

Movies like this are just fun, and they're never going to be award-winning or ""film of the year,"" but that's not why they're made. They're here for a little fun, a little raunch, and lots of action and predictable cliches that make ME laugh and make film snobs cringe. They kept with the formulas that worked in the first one: Similar jokes and ""rule"" statements, and the same cast (which people would have complained about HAD it been missing any of the original 4.) The additions of strong acting from Rosario Dawson and Zoey Deutch were just enough. In the end the only thing to save everyone from a zombie hoard at a defenseless, unarmed hippie commune is of course, a firearm.

Not really. Was it worth seeing? Hell yeah. Will I see this a few more times in the cinema? Yeah.Same gore, action, humour and pacing as the first but just set 10 years later with a new story and the two thread together so smoothly and effortlessly.Since then the main 4 have gone and grew as actors, all were amazing. New additions like Zoey Deutch and Rosario Dawson were hilarious.The running jokes with Tallahassee and an R.V were hilarious and Homer was great. No spoilers but if you get it, you get it.-10/10

The movie came out when I was young and I watched it countless amounts of time. So when they decided to finally make the sequel, I was very hesitant. The movie has surpassed all of my expectations and has made me watch through it multiple times.I have been a fan of Zoey Deutch for a decent amount of time now. I believe she is one of the best female actresses in today's world. She solidified that statement with her role as Maddison in Zombieland 2.

I then, too often these days just, find myself watching a sequel where all of the familiar characters are here, there are cameos (of varying quality), they learnt very little from the original process and ultimately I am viewing the circumstances where a finacier paid an amount of money for people, who enjoyed himself to get together and recycle the same, but to less effect.

544,danthebruv,Equally as fun as the first,8,15 April 2020,"I'd been looking forward to this. I had my worries of course as lots of reviews had been saying that it was a disappointment. But to be frank, I honestly have no idea what they're talking about. I thought this film was at least on par with the original and it was just as hilarious. The setup was interesting and a great development of the first, the zombies have evolved and are now faster and stronger than before, makes for an intriguing premise for a sequel. The zombies themselves look better and even more grotesque than ever, close up shots of kills make for some very equally disgusting and hilarious moments throughout the film that compliment the series' signature style. The original cast are back and have as good of a chemistry as they did in the first, they bounce off each other excellently and create some amusing scenarios. The new introductions have some great comedic timing and are welcome members to the cast. The Elvis references throughout were a great part of the film and I'd call them the Bill Murray moments of the sequel, although Mr. Murray still gets some references and even a cameo in the credits which was a hilarious touch to finish off the film with. Tallahassee being an overbearing father figure makes a lot of sense and is in line with his character, it also sets up the story for the film fairly naturally too. There isn't anything wrong with this movie at all and if I'm honest I don't know why the reviews are negative, I thought it was a worthy sequel that got just as many laughs as the first and it expanded nicely on both the world of Zombieland and the characters that inhabit it. The only part I didn't like is the leaning tower of Pisa kill, just felt slightly out of place in this universe. Other than that though, it was another solid inclusion to the Zombieland franchise and it once again leaves it open for any other entries, which I wouldn't mind at all. It feels fresh and fun and it never takes itself too seriously. I enjoyed the movie and I put it alongside the first as one of the better Zombie comedies.

550,FilmGuy86,Nothing New to See Here Folks,6,22 October 2019,"Rule 32: Enjoy the little thingsZombieland Double Tap is a satire on American culture that succeeds in delivering a few laughs while failing to offer any new insights into Americana. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) are all back riding out the zombie apocalypse in their new residence, the White House. Subtle political references permeate the space without becoming overbearing. For instance, Wichita can't become intimate with Columbus unless the eyes of Abe Lincoln's portrait are taped over lest he see's anything inappropriate. It's these small jokes woven in out of the film that entertain despite its well-trodden subject matter.Rule 4: Wear seat beltsMy biggest complaint with the direction of the feature is that it perhaps plays it a little too safe. Instead of exploring new subject matter, it sticks to the tried and true tropes of Americanism like shopping at the mall, and obsession of celebrity. While the jokes still work, they felt a little outdated, and more importantly, out of touch with the current western climate. Consequently the sequences felt very formulaic and familiar. I couldn't help thinking they were missing some opportunities to break new ground.Rule 5: No AttachmentsFor the most part, Zombieland Double Tap arbitrarily enforces rule number five on its audience by offering nothing new. While Zoey Deutch delivers a sidesplitting performance as the mall obsessed Madison, she is the colorful exception in this otherwise opaque adventure. At the end of the day, the flick entertains throughout its runtime but when the end credits roll there is little attachment to the characters or the world they inhabit.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Of course I want to support Jesse Eisnenberg and Emma Stone! They're great, but this was pretty lame. I enjoyed the action sequences. They were shot well, and looked great on the big screen. The zombie genre is pretty dead, when you really think about it. Zoey Deutch and Avan Jogia's characters were probably the worst part of it. Stereotyping isn't very clever. Come on, people! You can do better than this! I still enjoyed the film though, wouldn't say that it was bad. A better movie could have been made from a Zombieland sequel.

Now the idea isn't original anymore, which is often half the battle to win the audience over. The problem - for me anyways - the humor was most of the time off-putting, to strong emphasized or not funny, which is a big problem for a comedy. There were some good ones, but too little and wide apart. Offcourse a very subjective opinion.

This time what drives each character varies, and some don't actually get resolved at all. By the end, Tallahassee gets something we were never told he was missing, Columbus and Wichita are back to where they were at the start of the movie, and Little Rock actually doesn't get what she left the group for in the first place (Eisenberg's summary VO at the end avoids mentioning her at all) so it's unclear why she returns. The character of Madison is introduced to frustrate Columbus and Wichita's relationship, yet she is presented as a two-dimensional stereotype joke character and never as a serious threat to it so there's really nothing to overcome.In short you'll get more of the same from the first movie as the gang visit new places and meet other survivors, and don't get me wrong that often leads to great scenes. But unlike the first movie there's no common thread driving it, and you can't help but feel it was all rather pointless for most of the characters by the end.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Yes there were a few scenes here and there I wish was different but overall, really enjoyed it. Made me want to buy an RV and get together with some family or friends and just hit the road. Some things I am glad for, the outcome of Madison though I wished she had been with them at the end. In all fairness, it wasn't ""ha ha"" funny but like I said, I like the coming together of the team plus some more. Overall, I really did enjoy, as much as the first one.",Zombieland - Double Tap

This is an amazing follow up that delivers on all levels, I enjoyed it twice as much as the first and probably twice that as well lol!
The humour is spot on, it had me laughing all the way through it, from the running gag with their transport problems to the family guy style cut scenes involving the 'Zombie Kill of the Year'
(My favourite being the Italian guy and the leaning tower of Pisa, it had me in stitches!)
The addition to the cast if Zoey Deutch as Madison is truly inspiring! I thought she would annoy me in the trailers, but she is hilarious, and carries off the dumb blonde role with relish, and has some great lines, and really looks like she had a blast filming it! I hope they bring her back if theres a third movie.
Rosario Dawson is solid as Woody Harrelson's love interest, and kicks ass too as you'll see in the third act.

Which begs the question... why was this film even made?
When the characters in a story are cardboard cutout caricatures to begin with, you are heavily relying on either interesting plot points or well executed comedy to entertain the audience, both of which are seriously lacking in this film.

The first one ended perfectly and the plot to this was non-existent to say the least. Columbus is boring, Tallahassee is just mad and shoots stuff, Wichita has no real premise or role in the entire thing and her sister is dull and boring. As for the rip offs of Columbus and Tallahassee I cant see why they were put in the film just to die minutes later? Also who though ''Madison'' was a good idea? BORING! BORING! BORING!

And I love how they keep some of the same things as the first one as in having the intro music by the same artist Metallica.

I'll pause now while you do the age old list of sequels that were better. Once you get to Godfather II and maybe John Wick you're back here.
Seeing as I mention John Wick, this film takes the same transport of a continuing the story. In essence it's just one longer film with a 10 year intermission.
It has everything a zombie comedy flick needs.
Hats off to the fact that they doffed their own hats to Shaun of the Dead.
The walking dead reference was heeee-let it arrive-larious.
Also the T2 comments very clever.

The Ninja zombie would surely give our characters a bit more to worry about, a reason to look over their shoulder, also giving us viewers a sense of thriller at every little noise.In conclusion, I loved the movie, it was entertaining, I would surely re-watch it.",Zombieland - Double Tap
585,gamegargle,Captures the spirit of the original,8,28 October 2019,"This long awaited sequel is worth the wait. This movie is just plain fun in both comedy and action that is done in a very Zombieland-esque way. Original cast returns and the writers do a great job of capturing the spirit of the original! Actors do a great job and have good chemistry with one another, Woody Harrelson in particular steals the show! I had brought a few friends along and even the guy who hadn't seen the first one enjoyed this one!I was in-between rating this a 9 or 8, due to one scene, but it didn't last for too long. One of the characters in particular was written to be annoying, but it was written to give the scene a little more tension between two other characters (trying not to spoil anything in this review). Even if the character was written to feel annoying, it still was irritating to watch. But again that's just one scene/plot-point, and it was fairly minor. Another point that one of my friends pointed out was that it was a little cheesy so I can see how some people find that a negative. (Personally I don't mind that aspect of cheesy movies)Overall, I highly recommend this to friends that like zombie flicks, comedies, or fans of the first movie!

There are zombies everywhere and people dying but I'm laughing. A great plot to have fun and spend time. The construction of the character's personality was the main reason that made me interested to keep watching. Despite the cliche, you don't feel bored, because the movie shows you from the very start that it can make you get scared and laugh at the same time. To sum up, the second movie isn't better than the first, but this is not a problem, not even close. There are nostalgia and funny moments, same as the first, but the only thing that annoyed me was the inclusion of unnecessary characters. To make more fun? Maybe. To keep the plot, maybe.

The newbies, minus Dawson, are unfleshed out. They're 100% stereotypes come to life with none of the qualities that should make them human. Lifeless.In the end, I really didn't care if any of the original four I grew to love bit it in the end. And after a few, we all knew how this was going to end.Mildly funny at parts, but more annoying than humorous to me. Of course, humor is subjective. Story though was just not there from the opener.I don't like rating newer movies so high at first, but the first one was a 9 for me. Really was Damn near perfect.

My wife was found her to be annoying at first, but eventually warmed up to her.Our biggest dissapointment was, that none of the hippies at the Babylon commune got eaten by zombies. That would have been a truly satisfactory sight, that the movie chose withhold from us.

It's nothing new or overwhelmingly impressive, nor is it executed flawlessly. Yet, I really missed this crazy group of characters navigating this crazy zombie-filled world, and this film brought me back to them. Although making an effort to be bigger and better, it doesn't seem to go as far as to lose meaning or value- save for a few moments. Some time I'd rather spend with old characters was given to new, but the movie still doubles down on the personalities of these familiar characters and their struggles within their post-apocalyptic family dynamic. Where we start out they've learned how to live in Zombieland and they've been living well. That is, until we dive into their internal struggles coupled with a brand new physical threat. I was often amused by the new characters introduced and their respective places in the story, even when they're certain gag characters I didn't care for at first which, surprisingly enough, lead into my favorite action sequence in the whole movie. Even with an ending that in my eyes was rushed to reach that ""bigger and better"" sequel finale, it never lost me. At times, it does try to be explosively more epic than what came before, but that being said, remember: this is Zombieland, not World War Z. Mass amounts of zombies aren't going to tumble over a wall and a slaughter fest of epic proportions will not ensue. Or, maybe, exactly that does happen... but if it does it will be Zombieland style, not big budget zombie action flick style. Let's not forget how relatively minimal the first film was when it came to action. At the end of the day, as long as Double Tap doesn't lose sight of itself, I'll be all for it and despite going in nervous, I was indeed all for it.At heart, this is a movie about family and how they've grown together, then apart, and how they find their way back to one another. It was a fun movie with the action, the laughs, and the heart of the first. It was just Zombieland. It didn't need to be anything revolutionary or intricate, and it by no means is. It just had to embody what came before. It was a good time capitalizing on what made the first so impressive even when it threads the needle of sacrificing depth for surface. For fans of the original, there is surely enjoyment to be found in returning to Zombieland once again. The former holds a special place in my heart and this can't quite harness that same lightning in a bottle, but it comes close enough that I'm it glad exists.

I was very entertained, super cast, especially Zoey Deutch nails it! it's not often I find myself laughing watching a move alone, but with this one did multiple times.
I liked the first one, but I like the sequel more, it's just more fun and more everything..
Reading other people's comments about depth, character development Jada Jada, is just mind bobbling, being so anal and choosing to watch a zombie movie in the first place......I don't need to know the name of the clown, or the birthday of the Elefant in a circus to be entertained, If it works it works... enough said ..

Extremely lazy and devoid of creativity. In the beginning when the characters are introduced, they wear new and impeccable clothes, extremely clean and brand new clothes, in full apocalyptic zombie, I pretended that I did not see it, clean hair, clothes. ok ok. When the girl in pink introduces herself, she soon plays in the group and everyone starts a trip. There is no distrust, they are all happy and friends. After that is downhill.

It is a VERY boring and stupid movie. I mean if there is at least a bit intelligence left in you this movie is a disgrace and a boredom fest. First of all there is nothing original in this cinematic masterpiece, not to mention a lack of good old zombie hack n slash action.... The jokes in this movie is unbelievable, well maybe if you are an 15 year old teen you might squeeze a laugh. The dialogs are beyond unbelievably stupid and boring not to mention that the storyline of the movie is super mediocore to put it mildly. It is just a mystery to me how someone can rate this movie more than 5 stars, i guess the idiocracy in this world is running rampant.... So all in all i really do not recommend wasting your money or your time, maybe even your iq level by watchin this movie... Or if you are really into lame sex jokes, lots of bad romance in a zombie movie, superb dialogs and want to witness like only 20 minutes of zombie killing action this gem of a movie is definetally for you.

First off it is not as good as the first but it is still very funny and the cast are all great just like the first. The only thing is that the best part of the movie is the mid credit scene and I think that's a huge flaw is having one of the best written and acted at the credits. I think the plot is interesting but has been done before. But at the end of it, it's a comedy sequel so of course it usually isn't as good as the first so it was a very good comedy sequel and definitely recommend checking it out in theatres!!!",Zombieland - Double Tap

No. But how many sequels are?Is it enjoyable and entertaining?
Hell yes!This movie isn't trying to take itself seriously (how can it - it's Zombieland?) You can tell the cast was having fun, and the producers had a good time making it. It's not trying to be Citizen Kane or win any Oscars, it's just a fun follow-up to a great comedy horror.I would compare this to Lethal Weapon 2 vs. the original Lethal Weapon - some of the jokes are repeated, it's flawed compared to the first, but it stands solidly on it's own, with the characters continuing their wacky and dangerous adventures together.There's a lot to like in this film, and I enjoyed getting to see more survivors of the zombie apocalypse and how they handle staying alive.If you enjoyed the first film, you will like the second - I thought it was a solid effort, I was entertained throughout, laughing and smiling the entire movie.",Zombieland - Double Tap

Not nearly as good as the first one but fine. And the more I thought about it and the more times I watched it and after watching reviews, I realized how thin the plot is and how many things that don't make sense compared to the first one. It just felt like a cash grab to me.They shouldn't have made a second one, or they should have waited till they came up with a better plot and some character development for the main characters who haven't changed at all in the ten years they've been together.A shame and waste of potential:/",Zombieland - Double Tap

But not cool enough to save it from this 1 star. I was very excited about this movie like most. But was quickly disappointed. the character arcs are severely underwhelming. honestly if the characters' journeys were complete and made any sense i probably would've settled for five stars. an interesting character really can save a bad movie in my opinion. but this movies characters were f2d. the writing was lazy. the ""twist"" was the only event in this movie that was interesting and even that was a far reaching attempt to give the audience something to hang on to. this movie was just a rehash of the first. after credits rolled, i instinctually turned to my boyfriend and said ""i want my money back""",Zombieland - Double Tap
650,sebasdlvega,Stupid entertaining if you don't take it seriously,4,30 October 2019,"I just saw Zombieland: Double Tap and it was what i expected: ""a mediocre comedy"" only made for hang on to fama of the first one. And i Was right. So because my low expectations actualy i was abble to enjoy it. (kind of)Right at the beginning we can realize how badly this movie was written and the poor argument with which it was continued. We met 10 years after the first movie with the same characters: Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), Culumbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone), Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) to quickly introduce us to a ""cool scene"" taking the white house (Why ? Because yes) and almost immediately we are presented with the conflict, Little Rock no longer feels comfortable because he does not know people of her age and Wichita either because Culumbus had the brilliant idea of marriage and went into a panic. Under this pretext they leave a note, take the car and leave. Now if you saw the first movie, this may sound familiar and could you ask yourself again? And that 10 years have passed and they are in a zombie apocalypse that is the least argument to be able to make a second film that writers can think of.
However, that is not my problem with the film because if I expected such nonsense, such an unnecessary continuation, and I do not blame the actors for the poor performance with such a poor script and that he doesn't give a damn what happens to the characters as long as they are safe.
The thing is that Little Rock abandons her sister in the same way that she abandons others (these writers walk with everything) And as you can imagine, they used the most generic argument to continue the plot, to rescue her. But while I saw her I felt that it was not about rescuing Little Rock.
After Wichita left a month goes by, and Columbus meets Madison (Zoey Deutch) who is the most overreacted character of all but at least acts (something that cannot be said of any other) For me it feels like that Madison keeps the whole movie since it seems to be a cheerleading stereotype without much content in her brain and most of the humor is focused on her, I'm not going to lie if I get a laugh, but sometimes the humor was so uncomfortably silly It was hard to avoid it. That on the one hand.
Wichita returns to Culumbus and Tallahasse to be able to find her sister and this becomes a jealous fight and passive aggressiveness between Wichita and Culumbus to see that in a month I overcome her. Anyway, that's what the movie is about and it's so forgettable that I forgot almost all the comedy there was. So; And the zombies? Only 3 times for matters not relevant to the story (kill secondary characters and feel that our protagonists are in danger but really were always safe)",Zombieland - Double Tap

The characters were personable and made me care about them and made me root for them. I really enjoyed the original Zombieland movie. I saw it several times as a matter of fact.
BUT... Zombieland 2? What the heck happened? It's as if the characters are coasting on the success of the first. They don't even try to be interesting. They spend the entire first half doing nothing. It was dead space. Yeah, pun intended. Nothing happened. It was like the Seinfeld of the movie theater, the show about nothing, this was the movie about nothing... but unlike Seinfeld which was funny, Zombieland 2 was BORING.
The characters banter back and forth and back and forth and back and forth...Then they split up for the dumbest of reasons. It's as if they really didn't know what to do with themselves, so just split up and pretend like they don't mean anything to each other. Then suddenly oh, they do mean something to each other. Then more banter. Then a ditsy character joins in and she spends her time repeating herself. Yes, she's brainless. Okay. I got it. Please, stop beating me over the head with that!
I just think the writers had no idea what to do with these characters and just put them in a random pointless scenario just to tell the audience, ""look! remember these funny characters? yeah, laugh at them for no reason."" They all became so annoying that I actually walked out of the theater and asked for a refund, but they don't give refunds so I got a free ticket instead so I'm not too upset.
I was SO looking forward to this movie. I relished seeing the characters again. I wanted to laugh out loud and have a good time. Instead I yawned, I felt sleepy. I got bored out of my skull and I walked out.

I was a big fan of the first film, and after ten years to come up with a passable script this was nothing but a lazy copy and paste.

697,andrewsweirasw,Fabulously Zombieland,10,26 October 2019,"Zoey Deutch (Madison), made the movie genuinely rewarding. Every Zombie attack was amusing and unique. Every Zombie decommissioned was terrific. I love Bill Murray. The cast and crew out did themselves this movie; so very enjoyable. I see half a second into Italy, and know exactly what was about to happen, and laughed so loudly and boisterously it left the Theater of movie goers perplexed at my reaction two seconds into the scene; they eventually laughed, but it left me chuckling. I guessed the Rosario Dawson (Nevada) character would play a noteworthy role, and the final battle made it so very much enjoyable. A friendly nod to the douplegangers, Wilson (Albuquerque) played a delightful role. I was duly disappointed the initial new zombies weren't continued forward, especially like the Ninja Zombie. Probably predictable predicaments the Zombieland 2 cast faced leaving it wanting for more. It was my Tenth Anniversary of my first date with my wife, so it was very much appreciated.

Never thought a sequel could one up the original (well, Empire Strikes Back excluded) but this managed to do it. I laughed like crazy!What's no laughing matter though is if this were to actually happen. It sounds ridiculous, but with all of the crazy viruses and medical advances today, something could go wrong. Right now, we'd be safe. However, there are people and groups that are attempting to make sure that zombies could get to all of us. These folks want us disarmed and defenseless against the undead. Of course, I'm talking about Moms Demand Action, their members, and their leadership (Shannon Watts and Michael Bloomberg). These people want all of us to not be armed with the appropriate firearms should a zombie outbreak (or any disaster) occur. They don't want you to have magazines that hold enough rounds to defend against a horde of the undead, nor do they want you to have the best weaponry available to protect yourself. These people would rather we join the ranks of the thoughtless undead (much like they are, really) instead of being safe. Wichita's AR? BANNED if they had it their way. Her Sig P226? Nope! Can't have that! Takes a detachable magazine. Sigh......Great movie, and don't let people take your defense against the undead away.",Zombieland - Double Tap

This movie is nothing but a desperate appeal to the millennial market. Not once did I laugh or even smile throughout the entire movie as there is absolutely no original ideas or any entertainment of any kind in this sequel. This films success relies on nothing but random star appearances and various references to the original Zombieland. There is no character development, no real story and no real laughs. I cannot express how disappointed and un-entertained I was by this total waste of an hour and thirty minutes of my life. This is my first review, but I felt it was needed as a current rating of 6.9 stars is total nonsense.

Statistically improbable. #3 A monster truck jumps over a 2 story gate with no ramp.. gmafb. #4 Little Rock looks like she has been on the crack rock for the last 10yrs since the original zombieland. I'm not trying to be funny, she is in her early 20's but looks like a late 30's addict. #5 The terminator zombies can leap on top of a motor home but somehow they cannot climb over a girl holding a bicycle tire during the last scene. #6 The group surrenders their weapons to a bunch of hippies yet doesn't think to hide a weapon on their person like crack rock did.

We had low-ish expectations for this sequel but we're hoping for the best. It was lower than our lowest of low expectations.It was so slow. There was no real direction that the storyline was headed. So many characters were introduced then dead. And if the new characters did live, they were mega annoying and didn't add anything. So many old jokes rehashed and rehashed. No depth to any one person or thing in this movie.We kept hoping it would end. It was torture. Why didn't we turn it off? I guess it was kind of like watching a train wreck.

I mean if there is at least a bit intelligence left in you this movie is a disgrace and a boredom fest. First of all there is nothing original in this cinematic masterpiece, not to mention a lack of good old zombie hack n slash action.... The jokes in this movie is unbelievable, well maybe if you are an 15 year old teen you might squeeze a laugh. The dialogs are beyond unbelievably stupid and boring not to mention that the storyline of the movie is super mediocore to put it mildly. It is just a mystery to me how someone can rate this movie more than 5 stars, i guess the idiocracy in this world is running rampant....
So all in all i really do not recommend wasting your money or your time, maybe even your iq level by watchin this movie... Or if you are really into lame sex jokes, lots of bad romance in a zombie movie, superb dialogs and want to witness like only 20 minutes of zombie killing action this gem of a movie is definetally for you.

747,ricky-bellamy1805,A reminiscence of better times...,10,1 November 2019,"10 long years we have waited for this sequel. In a world full of sequels no one has ever really asked for, Zombieland: Double Tap is quite an interesting case. Judging by the current IMDb rating (7.2) it seems to be well received.
So, does it have a life-changing story? No.
Does it have an interesting plot twist? No.
Was it worth watching? Absolutely!
Unlike most sequels, Zombieland did not spit out it's sequel a year or two after. This, whether intended or not, made sure that fans would not grow tired of this world. Compared to the Fast and Furious franchise or the Pirates of the Carribbean. watching this sequel does not feel like a chore.
As such, it does not need any revolutionary new elements to the plot.
It does not need any deeper themes mirroring current issues. hough I think there were quite a few minor jabs at vegans/animal activists, which might explain the comparetively low critics score on rotten tomatoes.Considering Harrelson is a vegan himself though, these jokes just seem harmless and not overly political. Generally, I must say I have really enjoyed watching a movie that does not prioritize its political message of diversity, empowerment and god knows what over everything.
Sometimes all you need is more of the same. And that is what you get watching Zombieland: Double Tap. Definitely worth a watch. I will watch it again soon.",Zombieland - Double Tap

The characters seemed to have regressed since the last movie, both in their individual personalities being even more childish but also the relationship between characters. There is less chemistry between the cast compared to the last movie and they are generally more annoying and make stupider decisions. It's genuinely frustrating to watch.People are so flippant with supplies. They destroy cars like there's infinite lying about for comedic effect. In the last film I seem to remember that other than the main 4, no other humans feature in the film, but now there's loads?!? And noone's fussed about sticking together or getting to know other people. It's so weird.The humour is childish and the film's seems to focus on this while sacrificing what I loved about the first film, the goofy plot and relationship between characters. Everyone just seems like a caricature. The addition of Madison and the hippies is annoying at best of times and painfully cringe at the worst.",Zombieland - Double Tap

757,killerdash,Best movie of 2019,10,17 October 2019,"Honestly the best movie of 2019 by far. If you liked the first one, this steps up by miles, so you'll love it!Perfect mix between comedy, action and just all round awesomeness. This is my first time actually writing a quick review so take it from me this is worth seeing at the movies 10/10",Zombieland - Double Tap
758,racheccab,A few spoilers but mostly just complaints,4,24 October 2019,"I really did not enjoy this movie. Let me be clear, I freaking LOVE Zombieland and was so excited for this second installment and it might just be me that feels this way.
Take a tenner, two hours of your day and go see for yourselves because all of my friends loved it. I'm posting what I didn't like farther down so if people want to know they have to look knowing there might be spoilers ahead.I felt the jokes fell flat more often than they should have. I laughed when other people laughed bc I wasn't sure when to on my own. (And my sense of humor is ridiculously acute, I will literally laugh at fart sounds.)Some of the same jokes went on way too long, others were explained unnecessarily, as if the audience was lacking basic understanding in the art of subtlety and the underlying meaning of the frequently employed double entendres.The acting was...strangely hollow? Like they were relying on the hype from the first movie to carry them through this one and therefore didn't give the characters the same refreshing zeal as before.The characters, as a result of ^^, didn't work as well together this time, and bringing in two more characters based off two of the original characters only to kill them off comedically ten minutes later was a literal waste of time. (And money, that could have been used to make the movie a tiny little bit better.)There were WAY too many poorly timed, slow motion shots; it's a zombie movie, not Fast and Furious.Too many scenes could have been left out and the plot would have progress the exact same way.Filled with too many cheesy one liners and by the end I was just eager to get it over with.There was no actual sense of danger, or even a small jump scare, through the entire film. Jump scares are always fun, and there was not even ONE.They relied on nostalgia WAY too much and it was more and more obvious the longer the movie went on.My favorite part of this movie was any second that Zoey Deutch was on screen, and when the Dumb Blonde saves your movie, no matter how amazing the actress portraying her is, that's enough to make anyone say yikes.I could essentially predict the movie as it progressed and I hate that more than anything.
It was like the opposite of Aquaman, where at several points in the movie they would be having normal ass conversations only for the bad guys to literally explode onto the scene and interrupt. This easy, explosive, go-to for action movies would have been preferable to knowing exactly what was going to happen next.Tallahassee's 'dangerous' save, and then subsequent rescue, at the end didn't pack nearly the emotional punch it could have. It actually might have been a better movie had he died because at least I wouldn't have predicted it.One of the best things about this movie was Bill Murray's scene at the very end, and the vivacity he brought to his small 'role', and the amusement he brought me in those four minutes is The Only Reason this is a four star review and not a two star review.I love the actors and actresses, and crew, who worked on this movie, (and because of that love i will buy it when it's in dvd) I don't discredit them anything, but holy hell this movie was so boring I seriously almost cried when it ended.
If anything whoever wrote the script needs to be heavily reprimanded. Or just sent back to whatever film school they crawled their way out of.",Zombieland - Double Tap
759,Fluxysgirl,Terrible waste of money and time,1,25 January 2020,"I was in love with the first Zombieland movie. I can't remember how many times I've watched it. Double Tap is another one of those terrible sequels that should have never been made. I'm so disappointed and I wish I could have my money and time back. This movie actually ruined the first one for me. I feel so much sadness, hate and cringe today.",Zombieland - Double Tap

This movie was hilarious, entertaining enough that I held my extreme need to pee for the last half of the movie.",Zombieland - Double Tap
763,alsallalah,In the same vibe of the first one... Very entertaining!,8,21 October 2019,"I love how after 10 years it comes with the same ideas and jokes as the first on, if you liked the first movie then you'll definitely like this one, very recommended..
Oh Right, don't buy a large popcorn, the movie isn't very ""appetizing"".",Zombieland - Double Tap

765,rshort-26755,Disappointed,3,27 October 2019,The first Zombieland is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This fell short in story development and didn't capture me like the first one did. Although the break in the credits with Bill Murray was pretty good.,Zombieland - Double Tap

767,jsrios-27175,Disappointment,3,26 April 2020,Lazy writing and no pay offs. Very little thought seems to have gone into story. Just random scenes with overplayed plot devices sewn together with zombie fights.,Zombieland - Double Tap

Comedy sense of humour and perfect timing .
Great movie , must watch , value for money and time.",Zombieland - Double Tap
769,tmday-92111,It breaks my heart to type this.....,6,22 October 2019,"I absolutely love the first ZLand, but I gotta say that Im a little disappointed in Doubletap. It had some funny parts but some of the acting felt really forced and sometimes bordered on cheesy to me. Little Rock's character was really, really dull and flat. Tallahassee's rants/meltdowns were sometimes more cringy than funny, IMO. It just all felt a little off to me. Madison is the most annoying charcter ever, in my opinion, and added nothing to the movie at all. Her stupid valley girl accent was so over the top, I could hardly understand her sometimes. It just felt choppy and like a bunch of random stuff was thrown together. I saw it today, and I am feeling a little under the weather, so that may have a little to do with why I didnt love it. Idk 🤷‍♀️ Bc I love the first movie so much, I will give DTap a second chance when it comes out on DVD. Maybe it will grow on me if I watch it a few more times.",Zombieland - Double Tap

773,fantastickman,Just get through the first 30 minutes,7,31 December 2019,After that the movie starts to get going and goes from boring to interesting to great.,Zombieland - Double Tap
774,jrainofficial,cashgrab,5,13 November 2019,"Some of the jokes hit, but others missed or felt forced. The overall pacing was inconstant. The ending was dull and was out of place. The CGI effects were inconstant. Some scenes had good cg, while others where bad or rushed. Especially for one particular seen that was ""disaster movie"" levels of bad. Overall this movie felt like a cashgrab, piggybacking off of the success of the first movie.",Zombieland - Double Tap
775,pratermb,Pronounced Nevada wrong but...,7,8 April 2020,"Wasn't a bad movie. The theme carried on from the first film, though the end was a bit rushed. Could have used a little more depth, but it was a lot of fun.",Zombieland - Double Tap
776,diegokangaroo,10 Year Wait For This?,6,18 October 2019,"Double Tap feels like a very uninspired sequel. This film can be amusing at best and annoying at worst. This movie relies on reused jokes from 10 years ago so audiences can say ""Oh I remember that"". Tallahassee has become an annoying exaggeration of himself. Little Rock has nothing to do in the movie. Most of the New Characters are barely used. The best characters in this movie are Columbus, Wichita, and Madison surprisingly. This film just feels unnecessary and made for money grabs. There are some impressive action scenes and funny moments that are definitely redeeming. The new developments to the Zombie Land world are really interesting and fun to get into. This isn't a terrible movie, but definitely not worth the 10 year wait.",Zombieland - Double Tap
777,aidan-91547,They spent 10 years writing the best movie!,10,18 October 2019,This whole movie was a complete laugh zone. I have never seen a zombie movie no movie this good. The kills were hilarious and the story was great. In my opinion it was better than the first movie and the end was epic. The reference were so funny and it never got repetitive. YOU NEED TO SEE IT!,Zombieland - Double Tap
778,artukovicnedim,personal review,2,25 January 2020,"I'll start on the non bias note. The movie is funny ag first but the jokes you acrry from the previeous movie seem boring. the cgi and cinemotography is great and i really enjojed those parts of the ove however the writing is terrible. the same jkes are repeated in different circumstances, the action is good but is no step up from the first movie, and i enjoyed that one way more than this one. On personal side here the subplot with Madison seems over the top. He has been alone for a month givng him enough reason to stay with her. He has been alone enough to get over his past relationship, giving the Madison subplot enough to work in his favor. She is written as pbjectivley the ""cute"" character in the movie. She is a great companion to have even thouth you have ruined it by having her ""killed"" off screen for no purpose but she has tp come later to be the comedic relief in the ending scene just to satisfy the dumb audience this move wass targeted twoars. mo matter the rating you guys wanted to get, your movie is to be seen by younger audiences and she s just there so the writers can put her in bad sitations so she can be made fun off . She is over all friendly and cute twoars other characters but they write it oof emotionless, ljust to serve the plot where she inevitibly comes back. and iit is implied in the jurney that she has been killed oof, she is vmiting and, you hear two shots, the double tap rule. so how is t that she survived that if other characters really believed she was infected, This has nowhere to go. and how does she show up during the last scenes. it is just lazy writing on the work. working to ensure us it is a good tale with a happy ending. and she left him with a note. that suggest she is not into him. why wouldn't he devellop feelings for Madison in amonth. I would not suggest this mvo at all. This mvoie is a cashgrab just rubbing to the original",Zombieland - Double Tap
779,sinatra_follower-11671,Why would they made this mediocre movie?,5,22 October 2019,"The original was classic. The sequal is trash though. I wish they didn't make this movie. It's plot and scripts are without quality, there are no tension, and the excellent casts are such a waste. Don't bother watching it if you like the original.",Zombieland - Double Tap
