0,bkoganbing,From the jaws of death itself,8,10 June 2016,"The Australian cinema turned out a real gem of a fantasy film with Gods Of Egypt. Other than references in a lot of Mummy films Gods Of Egypt is the first I know to incorporate the ancient Egyptian religion and mythology in the plot itself.We're going way back here even before the time Charlton Heston liberated the Hebrew children to a time when Egypt was ruled by their deities who walked among them and took human form. They also could take the shape of some ferocious creatures if need be.Set and Osiris divided up Egypt back in the day, both sons of the sun God Ra. But Set who only had the desert while Osiris had the good real estate of the Nile and it's cities got tired of this arrangement and slew brother Osiris. He also fought and gouged the eyes out of Osiris's son Horus leaving him a blind and pitiable figure and a living reminder of what it means to cross Set who is played by Gerard Butler with Bryan Brown playing Osiris.While the Deities are in their turf war mortal Brenton Thwaites gets caught up in it and his girlfriend Courtney Eaton is killed. He wants to get back at Set and would like to team up with Horus if Horus dare permit himself an alliance with a mere human. But Thwaites has some moves and proves to be an unusual and resourceful ally.If you recognize it the elements from Alexander Korda's Thief of Bagdad loom large and clear here. The chemistry and scenes between Nicholas Coaster-Waldau as Horus and Thwaites is very good and the parallel of the two films is unmistakable. Korda only wished he had the computer graphic technology available when he did his spectacle masterpiece.Korda's film was shot in Arizona both for the vast scenery and for the fact that Great Britain was at war. The great vast interior of Australia has and will be a choice location shooting spot for a lot of films as travel is now easier to that still remote part of the world.I liked Brenton Thwaites character very much. In a cynical age where romance is not usually portrayed his was one of the best romantic characters I've seen on the big screen in years.In fact the very romance of the film made it a winner with me. See this one by all means.",Gods of Egypt
1,Leofwine_draca,Overblown CGI spectacle masquerading as a proper movie,4,19 March 2017,"Gods of Egypt is another example of overblown CGI spectacle masquerading as a proper movie. I appreciate the intent and have enjoyed many of the previous films in the career of director Alex Proyas, even his last one, KNOWING, which divided audiences somewhat. However, Gods of Egypt is a step too far, and contains very little actual content amid all of the endless CGI.It starts off well enough, that's for sure, with some good shocking scenes and impressive transformations at the outset. The CGI is pretty good, but there's so much of it that the viewer is quickly overwhelmed and in the end bored by it all. I call it the George Lucas effect after his interminable STAR WARS prequels. Characters turn into CGI, some characters ARE CGI, the action is CGI augmented, and the landscapes are CGI. Me, I prefer the good old-fashioned elements of film-making that seem to be in short supply in Hollywood these days.On the plus side, this film boasts a solid leading turn from Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, bringing plenty of his GAME OF THRONES charisma to the part. He gets to wisecrack a lot and he looks great, which is enough for me. Gerard Butler is all bombast as the villain of the piece who feels like an evil version of his King Leonidas. Some familiar faces round out the cast, like Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush, but the unwise choice was to make the main actor a bland former HOME AND AWAY star and, yes, he's really wooden, a big hole right in the centre foreground of the movie. Elsewhere, some of the spectacle is quite impressive, and I appreciate little touches like having the gods much larger than their mortal counterparts (a CGI effect first utilised in Jackson's LORD OF THE RINGS to depict the hobbits). A shame, then, that the majority of this movie is little more than instantly forgettable.",Gods of Egypt
2,SnoopyStyle,CGI extravaganza,5,4 June 2016,"Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is set to rule Egypt from his father Osiris. Set (Gerard Butler) steals the throne killing his brother Osiris. Set defeats Horus, takes his eyes, and his bride Hathor. Set kills anyone who opposes him and enslaves humanity. Bek (Brenton Thwaites) is a mortal thief. He steals one of Horus' eyes but his love Zaya is killed. He makes a deal with Horus to return Zaya to the living after they defeat Set. With Hathor, Goddess of Love, and Thoth (Chadwick Boseman), God of Knowledge, they set off to answer the riddle of the sphinx.This is overloaded with CGI flash and grandeur. It's fun visually for awhile but by the end, it becomes more of the same. The climax becomes sound and fury that signifies nothing more than waiting for the end. The story is simple good versus evil. Gerard plays evil for all it's worth. Horus is selfish at the beginning. Quite frankly, Bek is also selfish. Bek and Zaya are not more than puppy love. There is no development. They are simply in love. The good guys aren't that compelling. The whitewashing controversy doesn't help either. This is not the worst but it's not worthwhile to defend either.",Gods of Egypt
3,Horst_In_Translation,Sadly watching this is not a godly experience,4,10 January 2017,"""Gods of Egypt"" is a co-production between the United States, Australia, China and Hong Kong that resulted in this English-language movie. It runs for slightly over two hours and was written by Sazama and Sharpless, a duo also in charge of ""Dracula Untold"" and ""The Last Witch Hunter"". The director is (fittingly Egypt-born) Alex Proyas who has been making movies for over 35 years. So it is probably a bit disappointing how weak this one turned out. But if you read about actor George Butler (co-)starring in a film about ancient Gods, you basically know what to expect, even if he plays the main antagonist here. ""300"" was already a pretty mediocre (at best) film and so is this one we have here. The two good guy protagonists are played by Brenton Thwaites and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau.The title already states what you can expect here. It's a film in which Egyptian Gods clash about who is the real King of Cairo. It is very generic in terms of who is good and who is bad and it is all very predictable. The worst, however, may be the love story involving Courtney Eaton (""Mad Max"") as it all feels so negligible and there is not really a single point where you hope for the couple to stay together, apart from knowing they will be united in the end anyway. This also has to do with Thwaites' pretty bad performance. Of course, Butler and NCW are not exactly revelations either, but they somehow do what needs to be done and use their experience occasionally in order to elevate the truly weak material. But Thwaites does the exact opposite.Now looking at the technical aspects here, this film actually scored some awards recognition with regard to these and it describes pretty much perfectly what this film is about in terms of quality. As much as it lacks in the story department, it is pretty solid visually, but of course not great either. A final notion to actor Geoffrey Rush, Oscar winner and a personal favorite of mine: He is Australian and this may have a lot to do with him appearing in here, but he has almost nothing to work with to show us his talent and is just as forgettable as the rest despite playing a somewhat important character. Overall, absolutely nothing is really memorable about these two hours and at times it felt just like a collection of special effects. Very disappointing and I hope they do not decide at some point to produce a sequel for this relatively weak movie as the first film was already so bad at times that you cannot really justify its existence. Watch something else instead.",Gods of Egypt
4,claudio_carvalho,Underrated Adventure,8,19 June 2016,"In the ancient Egypt, the god Ra (Geoffrey Rush) has split Egypt in two: the fertile part with the Nile would be ruled by his son Osiris (Bryan Brown) and the desert by his son Set (Gerard Butler). During the coronation of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) by his father Osiris, Set betrays his brother and kills him. Then he withdraws the eyes of Horus that are his source of power and exiles him in the desert. The mortal thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and his beloved wife Zaya (Courtney Eaton) that worships Horus become slaves of Set. Zaya, who is working for Set's architect Urshu (Rufus Sewell), convinces Bek to steal the eyes of Horus from a well-protected pyramid designed by Urshu to give them back to Horus, the only one capable to defeat Set. Bek succeeds but retrieves only one of the eyes; however Urshu discovers the theft and Bek and Zaya need to flee. Urshu kills Zaya with an arrow and when Bek reaches Horus' shelter, he proposes to help the god to retrieve his other eye. In return, he demands that Horus bring his beloved Zaya back from the world of the dead. They team up and soon Horus' lover Hathor (Elodie Yung), the goddess of love, leaves Set and joins them in their quest to defeat the evil Set.""Gods of Egypt"" is an underrated adventure. The story is highly entertaining but the great cast is overshadowed by the special effects. The plot is funny and is a delightful joke regarding the mythology. It recalls the naive and silly adventures that older viewers used to see in the matinees, and therefore highly recommended. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Deuses do Egito"" (""Gods of the Egypt"")Note: On 26 December 2020, I saw this film again.",Gods of Egypt
5,nogodnomasters,Time to go fishing,7,31 January 2018,"This tale is inspired by the mythology of Egypt concerning the battle of Set (Gerard Butler) and Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau). Set murders King Osiris (Bryan Brown) and removes the blue eyes of Horus in battle as he takes over the throne and banishes Horus. Set imprisons the humans. Bek (Brenton Thwaites) a mortal and a thief loves Zaya (Courtney Eaton). He manages to steal an eye of Horus from Set and Zaya is killed as they flee Egypt. Bek makes a deal with Horus to get his girl back from the afterlife, but the clock is ticking. Yes, there is a love story in all of this.This tale was cleaned up a bit. There is no mention that the wives are also sisters and Horus' wife-sister was also his mother at one time. This was a common theme in ancient mythology. Horus was said to have blue eyes. They knew this and made his eye jewels blue, but not his actual eyes, apparently blue contacts would have broke the budget after spending a gazillion on special effects and great graphics. Loved the snakes. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Horus was very stiff.I know a lot of it was by design, but the character was boring. Gerald Butler fared a little better as Set, but the film needed help. Brenton Thwaites and many of the actors seemed held back as the film centered on special effects and not the characters. Rufus Sewell, Chadwick Boseman, and the scantily clad women I liked.Was that a polyethylene mattress that Bek landed on? Couldn't they have made it a bed of feathers?Great graphics. Mediocre acting. I never felt the excitement. Guide: No swearing. Implied sex. Camera angle prevents nudity in one scene.",Gods of Egypt
6,kosmasp,If Egypt had Popcorn movies ...,6,22 January 2017,"Well they would have to have theatres to play them in too of course. But I derive and this actually has many flaws. It's way too easy to take this apart on many things. Gerald Butler is overplaying it, the CGI, the story and much more. But why get mad, when you can have fun. And there is a lot of that to be had.Just dive into this movie and watch it free of all, if you can. Because this is how this wants to be watched. And if you can do that, then you are in for a very fun and entertaining ride. Most of it doesn't make sense and it's more or less one sequence paired with another, but tries to encapsulate the Harryhausen feeling. And in some regards I'd say it did. Before you cry sacrilege (especially because it was real tough work that was put into those stop motion films back in the day), I'm talking about the general vibe. If you can appreciate that, roll with it",Gods of Egypt

8,paul_haakonsen,When the gods walked among mankind...,7,15 August 2016,"Already from the trailer alone, you know that this is going to be a special effects movie. And with that in mind, you might already be setting yourself up for a movie that doesn't really require much thinking from you as an audience.Well, that is partially true actually. The movie is a spectacular display of visual effects, both in CGI and props. And these dazzling effects do carry the movie a great long way, I will say that much. And the story, while it is simplistic, actually did turn out to be entertaining. Sure, it wasn't a brain challenger, not by a long shot, but you know what you are getting into with ""Gods of Egypt"".While we are on the CGI and special effects, then I must admit that it was the selling point for me, because I was blown away how they had managed to bring ancient Egypt and their ancient Pantheon to life with today's CGI and special effects.As for the cast, well, they could have opted for someone a bit more thespian, considering the talents of both Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gerard Butler. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that they did it poorly. Actually far from it, but they are more of a physical kind of acting in terms of action, more than they are set in ways of deeper character portraying through acting.There is a lot of action throughout the entire movie, and you are constantly being bombarded with visual effects, to the point where it brims on being over-used. But it worked for me.If you enjoy a good fantasy movie with roots in actual ancient history, then ""Gods of Egypt"" is definitely worth your time and money. I do think, however, that ""Gods of Egypt"" is the type of movie that you can watch every now and again with some years in between each watching.I am rating ""Gods of Egypt"" a well-deserved seven out of ten stars. This was good, wholesome entertainment wrapped up in a visually impressive package.",Gods of Egypt
9,Quinoa1984,a waste of talent and time and extravagant dollars,3,25 June 2016,"Gods of Egypt is meant to sell itself primarily on the visual effects spectacle - not unlike, going back some generations, to those dopey but entertaining special effects extravaganzas with work by Ray Harryhausen and featuring a stock of memorable creations amid a sea of lame-to-competent acting and direction. But now it's 2016 and with this movie, not even the CGI on 1990's XENA TV series (if you've ever seen that and know what I mean) was this cartoonishly awful. If it had been a SyFy channel movie I might accept it. As a 100+ million dollar extravaganza, it's almost a nightmare - too long (at 127 minutes it feels like 187), and it's got story turns and characters that... wait, what characters? This is the kind of movie that gives a major talent like Geoffrey Rush little to do but spout platitudes and be set on fire shooting at things.Some of this is so stupid I found myself laughing - a lot - but not in the places I'd think Proyas half expected people to do so. And no one, not even poor Gerard Butler, can get enough energy to possibly ham or camp it up, but the serious delivery doesn't allow for many rewards for the viewer looking for good OR bad movie fun. Most motivations are weak and things involving how this world works can sometimes turn on a dime and not make sense anymore (it'd take too long to go into some of the things that are not nitpicks but glaring, holy-s***-how-did-anyone-let-this-pass flaws), and despite a consistency to the look of the world and the characters, perhaps the director's only strong suit in coralling so many elements together, it's all for a story and heroes/villains/Gods/side Gods/hot-Goddesses that is dead on arrival.What have you lizard people done with Alex Proyas?",Gods of Egypt
10,LeonLouisRicci,"""If I even tried to explain it your brain would liquify and flow out your ears.""",8,28 September 2016,"The above Quote in the Movie from ""Thoth"" says it all.But here's a Try, Nonetheless...Outrageously Over the Top may be a Redundant way of Describing Director Alex Proyas' Vision or Version of another ""Gods"" of Mythology Film that have come ""Fast and Furious"" to Movie Screens in Recent Years. But this one is more ""Fast and Furious"" than any.It Works so Well because, unlike those others (You know who), this Beautifully Garish and Gaudy Movie Never for one Nano-Second takes itself Seriously. It is Presented for Your Consideration as a Dreamscape of Pre-History. The Golden-Age and Speaking of Gold.In this Fantasyland the Gods actually have Gold Pulsating through Their Veins instead of Blood and that Really-Cool Twist is Reflected in the Template of this Eye Popper at every Turn and every Level.It is a Film Designed to Push, Stretch, and Reach for the Limits of Current Capabilities concerning CGI in Modern Movie Making. What it Lacks in Thespian Talent, it makes up for in a Grandiose Vision filled with a Colorful Vibrancy.It's Artistic Scheme of Things Reminds of Comic-Books, Pulps, Heavy Metal Magazine, Computer Games, Poster Art, and other Pop Culture Splashes of Loud, Lurid, Luscious Displays that Attract Attention, if not Praise from the Cultural Elite.The Tweaking or Embellishment of Egyptian Mythology is Clever and done with a Wink and a Wonderment from a Director that's Not Afraid to Take Chances, Tilt the Windmill, and Challenge the Film-Making Status Quo. Not Everything Works to Perfection but this Piece of Modern Art cannot be as Easily Dismissed by Uppity Critics and Knee-Jerks so Quickly.This has all the Aspects of a Cult-Movie and while it is Currently Dismissed by most as ""God-Awful"", Future Reflection and Reaction to this Entertainment will be just the Opposite.Proyas will be Redeemed as Time Passes, because this is a Timeless Treat for Anyone who can Enjoy Pure, Infectious Eye Candy that has No Pretensions of being anything else.",Gods of Egypt
11,CinemaSerf,Plods of Egypt.,5,8 June 2021,"It's a real shame that such a rich vein of exciting mythology has been reduced to this really badly acted and written celebration of the art of the computer programmers. That's not to say that their creative and technical skills are not appreciable. Indeed, this is a great looking film with some engaging visual effects and quite a decent score, too - but even the cute smile of Brenton Thwaites, the occasional contribution from Geoffrey Rush (with his tongue will implanted into his cheek) and something akin to the cerebral from Chadwick Boseman cannot turn this slowly paced effort that is as derivative of ""The Mummy"" (without any attempt at humour) as it is of ""Clash of the Titans"" (without the monsters) into anything substantial. I suppose to have acted amongst a series of almost entirely green screen scenarios must have been quite difficult - but sadly, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau is simply not up to the task, and Gerard Butler - well, what does he think he is doing in this drivel? This could have been so very much better, if someone had taken the time to develop these ancient characters and present us with a storyline that challenged our imagination. As it is, it's little better than a glorified cartoon that I suggest needs to be forgotten.",Gods of Egypt
12,zardoz-13,Better Than Average Sword and Sorcery Saga,7,29 February 2016,"Hollywood has always suffered from a jaundiced perception of reality that creates discontent about its films, and ""Dark City"" director Alexis Proyas' superficial sword & sorcery saga ""Gods of Egypt"" is the latest casualty. Anybody who followed the pre-release controversy surrounding this $140 million spectacle about Egyptian mythology knows that the pillars of political correctitude have criticized it savagely it for its largely all-white cast. Comparably, ""Alien"" director Ridley Scott contended with the same criticism of his Biblical epic ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"" for its essentially Caucasian cast. Scott claimed he couldn't find bankable actors of color or ethnicity to portray his characters so his film could recoup its multi-million dollar budget. ""Gods of Egypt"" director Alexis Proyas and Summit Entertainment, the studio that released this 127 minute movie, apologized about their whitewashed cast before the film's release. Nevertheless, this isn't the first time Hollywood has clashed with the politically correct about casting the appropriate actor and actress. Most recently, the botched fairy-tale fantasy ""Pan"" cast Mara Rooney as a Native American character when she was anything but Native American. Films better and worse than ""Gods of Egypt"" have drawn flak from the Politically Correct fraction. ""Birth of a Nation,"" ""Cleopatra,"" ""Prince of Persia,"" ""Argo,"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"" exemplify Hollywood films that violated the tenets of political correctness. Casting celebrity actors rather than unknown native counterparts to attract audiences is the main reason. Clark Gable was far from British when he starred in ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" back in 1935. Of course, a British actor would have been more credible, but Hollywood wanted a genuine star instead of an authentic Englishman. Hollywood concerns itself about making money more than abiding by political correctness. Occasionally, however, a Hollywood producer appeared, like Mel Gibson, who defied traditional casting protocol. In his adventure epic ""Apocalypto"" (2006), Gibson hired Native American actor Rudy Youngblood to play a Mayan warrior. Happily, Youngblood was conversant enough with speaking in Mayan to make the difference work. In ""Gods of Egypt,"" Gerard Butler could have eliminated his Scottish accent, but the political incorrectness of his casting prompted neither Proyas nor Summit to recast another actor. Indeed, miscast as he is, Butler remains a highly sought-after actor and his bankability as a star enhanced the box office potential for this mythological melodrama.The larger-than-life exploits in ""Gods of Egypt"" occur before the dawn of dynastic history, and all of it is preposterously outlandish. ""Dracula Untold"" and ""The Last Witch Hunter"" scenarists Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless appropriated the Egyptian myth ""The Contendings of Horus and Set"" as their source material. Pitting the gods Set and Horus against each other with the throne of Egypt as the prize, Sazama and Sharpless have forged an above-average, often contrived, but nevertheless entertaining escapade. Indeed, they recycle familiar conventions, but they have enlivened these shenanigans with a surprise or two. Proyas, who also helmed ""The Crow"" and ""I, Robot,"" never lets the pace slacken, and he stages some compelling close-quarters combat sequences. Of course, we know the young mortal heroine, Zaya (Courtney Eaton of ""Mad Max: Fury Road""), never stands a chance of being condemned to death in the Underworld. Similarly, you also know the Egyptian Lord of the Air, Horus (Danish actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau of ""Game of Thrones""), is going to reclaim his throne that his treacherous uncle, Set (Gerard Butler of ""300""), took from him after he tore Horus' eyes out and forced him into exile. Not only did villainous Set steal the crown from Horus, but he also stabbed Horus' noble father Osiris (Bryan Brown of ""FX"") to death in front of everybody at Horus' coronation. Mind you, you need not avert your eyes because this lavishly produced, PG-13 rated movie depicts these depredations in a manner shouldn't offend anybody. Despite some grandiosely choreographed battle sequences, ""Gods of Egypt"" never wallows in blood and gore. Everything unfolds as our charismatic young hero, an ""Aladdin"" like thief named Bek (Brenton Thwaites of ""Maleficent""), steals a dress for his gorgeous girlfriend, Zaya, so she can attend Horus' coronation in the height of fashion. After Set halts the coronation, murders Orisis, and then blinds Horus, Zaya finds herself enslaved to the evil Grand Architect Urshu (Rufus Sewell of ""Dark City""), but she concocts a plan so Bek can steal back Horus' eyes and restore him to his rightful position as monarch. Urshu surprises them and kills poor Zaya with a well-aimed arrow. A desperate Bek appeals to Horus to save Zaya. The lofty Lord of the Air calculates that he can save her before she reaches the ninth gate of the Underworld. Secretly, Horus isn't being entirely truthful to Bek. Meantime, Horus' grandfather, the Sun God Ra (Geoffrey Rush of ""Shine""), wages a never ending battle against a toothy titanic worm with which Set seeks to destroy Egypt so he can acquire immortality in life. Most of what occurs is stuff you've seen before in movies celebrating legendary Greek gods, such as ""Clash of the Titans,"" ""Wrath of the Titans,"" and ""The Immortals."" The Egyptian settings, however, add novelty to this narrative. The deserts of Australia stand-in splendidly for the Sahara Desert. The computer-generated imagery is truly exceptional, with some of the best 3-D effects. At times, when you are admiring some of these over-the-top shenanigans, ""Gods of Egypt"" feels like an awesome guilty pleasure. Despite its politically incorrect casting, ""Gods of Egypt"" qualifies as exciting from start to finish. The spectacular CGI laden effects are dazzling enough to compensate for its standard-issue, formulaic conventions. The shape-shifting gods who tower above mere mortals reminded me of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and the ""Transformers"" franchise. Some scenes that invite derision involve characters riding humongous, fire-breathing snakes or Set soaring above a battle in a sleigh pulled by giant scarab beetles. Sadly, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau emerges as a rather lackluster hero, while Butler overshadows him in every scene. Altogether, ""Gods of Egypt"" is lightweight but enjoyable hokum.",Gods of Egypt
13,neil-476,"Dumb as a box - or plague - of frogs, but hugely entertaining",7,23 May 2018,"Head God Osiris is about to crown his son Horus king when his stroppy brother Set turns up, kills him, nicks Horus' eyes, and usurps the throne. This regime change leads ultimately to Zaya, the cute and bosomy girlfriend of petty thief Bek, being killed, and Bek trying to motivate the somewhat depressed blind Horus to prevent her from facing oblivion when she is judged in the underworld. The first step is to try to recover Horus' eyes, following which a trip to sun-God grandfather Ra is on the cards.The word ""hokum"" (loosely defined as ""theatrical nonsense"") isn't used very much these days, but hokum is exactly what this film is.. Loaded up from start to finish with state of the art CGI, over the top performances (which include some extremely bad acting - no, let's call it ""mannered performances"" - from Chadwick Boseman and Elodie Yung), straight-faced earnestness from Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush, and a story which dips into Egyptian mythology but never lets it interfere with its daft story, it doesn't take itself seriously for a minute, and the commendably straight-faced players convey an underlying awareness of their participation in, well, hokum. And I do like films which are tripe, know they are tripe, and aren't ashamed of it (see also: Drive Angry).I loved the look of this film. The Egyptian mythology feeds into the production design, the fact that these double-sized Gods co-exist with mortals is achieved well (better than in Peter Jackson's Rings/Hobbit films). The action was well-staged, I loved the overall daftness, and I found Courtney Eaton's bulgy cleavage utterly delightful. Most of the other female cast were alluring, also.Grab your popcorn and enjoy some glorious nonsense.",Gods of Egypt
14,FlashCallahan,Flash!!!!! Of The Titans....,6,9 March 2016,"The survival of mankind hangs in the balance as a mortal hero Bek, undertakes a journey to save the world and rescue his true love. In order to succeed, he needs the help of the powerful god Horus, and team up against Set, the merciless god of darkness, who has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the peaceful empire into chaos. As their battle against Set takes them into the afterlife and across the heavens, both god and mortal must pass tests of courage and sacrifice if they hope to survive, an to prevail.........The past ten or so years hasn't been kind to Proyas. I, Robot was enjoyable enough, but after repeat viewings, I can only remember Will Smith saying 'oh hell no' and pretending to sneeze because he's allergic to someone's lies.And Knowing was also okay, but it's best remembered for having a cow on fire and containing the quick downward spiral of Cages career.And now there's this film, and if like me saw the one sheet and thought 'this is going to be a spectacular failure' then it's worth two hours of your precious time.The film is terrible, the casting is dodgy, but that's Hollywood for you, so I'm not getting on my soapbox about choosing a Scottish Egyptian king, because no one moaned about Highlander, and that film has reached a cult status of legend.It's terrible because it's just beyond camp, so confusing, with ineffective humour and some of the most lethargic fight scenes seen in a long time................but by George, it's a lot of fun.Butler has never been so enjoyable on screen, to say he's channelling Blessed in Flash Gordon is an understatement, he chews scenery with every line he spouts, and despite the ridiculousness of it all, he appears to be having such a wonderful time.Our two heroes though are nothing more than a couple of Tolkien wannabes. They hate each other to begin with the old mortal and gods don't mix argument is the main reason, but wouldn't you know it, they become great friends and throw away eyeballs like nobodies business.Add Geoffrey Rush as a Space God Laurence Olivier wannabe, Green Screen that begs you to ignore the 2D version, and some hilarious Dune like costumes and obligatory quite good Special Effects, and you have one big mess of a film.Whether its historically inaccurate isn't the point, the point is that the film entertains, albeit for all the wrong reasons, but it entertains in a way that seeing an old woman falling over some ice entertains.You know you shouldn't be watching it, but you do, and for about five minutes after seeing it, you are happy in a 'I haven't got a clue why' sort of way.It's this years Ishtar, Hudson Hawk, and Dune.And it'll be remembered fondly in years to come, because of its sheer stupidity.A must see for any bad movie aficionado....",Gods of Egypt
15,phd_travel,Spectacular visuals and a clever story,8,25 February 2016,"I enjoyed this over the top extravagant adventure set in Ancient Egypt.Good points: The script cleverly uses the legends of the Egyptian gods. It's fun to see the god brought to life and transform into various birds and beasts. Now everyone can visualize the gods instead of imagining them from a 2 dimensional painting on a wall. The tale of Horus avenging the murder of his father Osiris by fighting Set is brought to life. There is quite a lot of dialog and humor for a movie of this type. The visuals are spectacular dizzying and fantastical. You get some pretty impressive cities temples caves tombs pyramids and the underworld. It's true they have gone a bit overboard with the sets and scenery that border on gaudy and crowded to be distracting. Egypt is just made to look too colorful, and there are too many massive heights to plunge down cliffs and waterfalls. Egypt is a pretty flat country and it just seemed a bit too much. But in the end even if it was too over the top at least it felt grand.Weak points: The cast was hit and miss. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Hathor looks more like a bad guy than a good guy - he should have been the villain Set instead. As Set, Gerard Butler's Scottish accent was jarring. Australians Brenton Thwaites and Courtney Eaton make the cute young mortal couple. Again their clipped British accents were out of place. It would have been better if they spoke with more neutral slightly Middle Eastern accents so as not to be so incongruous. This is tied in with the controversy that the cast was not ethnically correct. This is partly right with the very blonde actresses in various supporting roles and Geoffrey Rush as Ra is out of place. Chadwick Boseman is the only actor of African descent in a major speaking role. But this mistake in casting isn't a fatal flaw. At least Elodie Yung as love interest Hathor looks a bit more ethnically suitable and she is quite beguiling. Some of the fighting was a bit dizzying and formulaic. A bit headache inducing.Bottom line - this is a grand blockbuster with it's clever story using Egyptian legends. Worth a watch on the big screen.",Gods of Egypt
16,trashgang,"not for me, low on everything I thought it should show",6,23 May 2016,"I saw the trailer of this flick just before the superman vs batman flick. It looked great and have seen Immortals (2011) which I really liked I was looking forward for another flick about the Gods of Egypt. Sadly it wasn't my thing at all. Not that I was bored or whatsoever but it was clearly made for everybody. No gore or nudity to see.I mean, in the beginning there's a murder going on with stabbing, you can see the knife going in the flesh but no blood, when he wipes his knife clean there's no spot of blood to wipe. And we do have a love scene and the so-called queen is indeed undressed but it's all filmed without showing a thing. Further the CGI used is really good but not that superb because sometimes you could easily spot the key used to fill in the picture. Also the Gods are shown on a strange way, some faces are correct with history but Ra sitting on a ship and stuff like that, just look at Egypt itself. Where is the dessert? For me it was more a story like the old Sinbad flicks or even the Clash Of The Titans flick(s). An immortal helping 1 God to fight against his brother God and yes, there are monsters around to defeat. So if you think it's truth to history it isn't, it's a pure fantasy flick.

17,siderite,"Unexpectedly fun movie, although not better than average",7,20 May 2016,"I didn't expect to like the film, but I did, sort of. The actors are decent, the story a bit silly, but fun, the CGI is way over the top, but sometimes in a good way, sometimes it feels like watching a game cinematic from the early 2000's.In this story where someone needs to tell Set this is definitely not Sparta, Horus not to loose any more body parts and Osiris that sadism is not everything in life, a young guy that looks and acts like Aladin, but is not, uses the power of love to rival the gods themselves - making the goddess of love kind of superfluous there. And since that was the only female actress that is worth mentioning, this is movie about guys with naked chests and big swords that has received positive reviews mainly from the female audience, but keeps some dazzling CGI fights and use of technical know how to keep guys interested.One can go past the bad CGI easily - I mean, who has seen a god recently? it's not like you can say ""heeey, gods don't actually look like that!"" One can ignore the ridiculous cardboard motivations of the characters - they're from Egypt, how smart can they be, even if they are all mostly white? One can also go past the story, because face it: it's a fairy tale and that's how they are. However, once you have finished the getting past part, you realize the movie is over and not much else has happened except bits that you purposely ignored. Fun though.",Gods of Egypt
18,StevePulaski,A low-rent script with a high-stakes pricetag,4,27 February 2016,"""If I were even to try to explain, your brain would liquefy and pour out your ears."" - actual line from ""Gods of Egypt."" Such a quote is so appropriate for a film like ""Gods of Egypt,"" a two-hour long raucous ride through glorious production design and mediocre everything else. Rarely do I find myself sitting in an action film silently begging it to transition from scenes involving never-ending dialog and flat character relations to something more lively and harrowing. Fortunately, ""Gods of Egypt"" packs a wallop in its plethora of action sequences, but in order to get to the visual goods, you must sit through, in total, over an hour of monotone dialog spouted from beefy, hulking Gods that wears on the mind so quickly you wish they would just morph into chrome-coated creatures again and begin dueling until something meaningful happened.Consistent readers of my work will take note that I usually do not possess such an attitude when watching action films. Normally, I like my action/epic films with a lot of characterization and dialog; even if it's poorly conceived or lackluster dialog, I usually acknowledge the film's ambition to try and turn Gods and mythical heroes into characters modern audiences can sympathize with. With ""Gods of Egypt,"" my admiration began to breed contempt after I saw what the film's visuals were capable of; after that, sitting through endless, rote dialog by characters who are just mythical cut-outs of Egyptian Gods, was just not what I was in the mood to do. The visual effects in ""Gods of Egypt"" are extraordinary; a commendable mix of modern sleekness with the pulpy aesthetic of a medium-budget epic, the production design in this film is truly something to behold.The film is centered around a mortal named Bek (Brenton Thwaites), who aligns with the Egyptian God Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) following the death of his lover Zaya (Courtney Eaton) in efforts to dethrone Set (Gerard Butler), the God of Darkness who has just seized the empire. What entails is a brutal struggle for Bek and Horus to get through numerous different traps and roadblocks in order to get to Set to reclaim the throne of the Egyptian empire and try to resurrect Zaya.I spend so little time introducing the plot for two reasons: one, if you're going to see ""Gods of Egypt,"" the plot is probably the last thing on your mind, and two, it's convoluted thanks to the overabundance of characters and the lack of clarity in the respective chronology and period when this is occurring. The latter issues make it difficult to sink into ""Gods of Egypt"" and become invested in it on a personal level. This is precisely what led to me simply wishing for more action sequences than anything in the way of character dialog.The characters here are so archetypal and flat they might as well be hieroglyphics. They are fearless, immortal (even the mortals, it seems) beings that never seem to be in any real danger regardless of the circumstances, and they're played and written in a manner that doesn't engage. Thwaites and Coaster-Waldau are not very engaging screen presences at all, and for the umpteenth time, neither is Gerard Butler, who keeps getting cast in these films as if he truly bring some layeredness to the table. I'm convinced that all three of these actors, with the appropriate script, could be extremely convincing performers in a film, but once again, especially in Butler's case, Hollywood seems to have a lack of confidence and conviction in them as performers and throws them into a film with a low-rent script with a high-stakes pricetag.To be fair, the high-stakes pricetag results in some of the most visually eye-catching effects we're likely to see this year. The entire film is gorgeously photographed, largely thanks to the sun-soaked cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr., who has helped shoot everything from the ""Lara Croft"" films to ""Kangaroo Jack."" Menzies Jr. and director Alex Proyas direct this film with a series of sweeping shots and nicely paced sequences of peril, my personal favorite being a scene where both Bek and Horus are challenged with outrunning two gigantic, fire-breathing serpents on a maze-like floor. And let's not forget the suspenseful sequence involving Bek trying to obtain a glowing gem on heavily booby-trapped floors, which accentuates everything one has come to love about modern action filmmaking. However, as stated before, these scenes only come interjected between the incessant amount of droning dialog we have to endure over the course of a terribly long-wined two hours.The epitome of irony is ""Gods of Egypt"" opening on the same weekend as the 88th Academy Awards premiering on TV, which is being criticized for the second year in a row now for a lack of diversity, and the film featuring a cast largely comprised of Australian performers. Not to mention, the country of Australian apparently gave the film a 46% tax break if it shot on-location in Australia, which continues to add to the question; was this film made by the people who have their names on the credits or simply made by the circumstances that keenly fell into place for the filmmaking process (no-name actors in the biggest roles resulting in lower pay for talent, tax writeoffs, an ethnically challenged cast, etc)?",Gods of Egypt
19,KineticSeoul,CGI extravaganza,6,17 June 2016,"This isn't a terrible movie like some critics claim it to be. But maybe that is because I have seen a lot of really bad movies. What this is, is a high budget CGI extravaganza, where the CGI is good, to okay to just bad. This would have worked fine as a video game, but as a movie where the narrative is very important...The movie just falters. I could tell there was quite a bit of effort that went into this movie. But it just seemed so darn impetuous when it comes to the narrative. Where characters just keep going from one point to another with the whole thing feeling detached. Despite the budget everything felt cheap because the movie just didn't have any heart to it. Despite the shortcomings, it's at least somewhat watchable and that is because of the budget. Now I am not saying every high budget movie is watchable, but in this case it's at least watchable. It's not a movie I would watch again but it's a okay popcorn flick when it's on Netflix.6.5/10",Gods of Egypt
20,Hellmant,"If you can overlook that racist injustice, the movie isn't that bad.",7,16 March 2016,"'GODS OF Egypt': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Big budget action-fantasy flick, from director Alex Proyas (the man who also helmed such beloved fantasy hits as 'DARK CITY', 'KNOWING', 'I, ROBOT' and 'THE CROW'). It was written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (the duo that also co-wrote such other mythical fantasy flicks as 'DRACULA UNTOLD' and 'THE LAST WITCH HUNTER'). The movie notoriously stars a mostly white cast of actors, as Egyptian gods and mortals: that are battling for all of Egypt. The cast includes Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Elodie Yung, Courtney Eaton, Geoffrey Rush, Bryan Brown, Rufus Sewell (who also starred in 'DARK CITY') and Chadwick Boseman (the one cast member of African decent). Despite being cheesy, and over-the-top, I mostly enjoyed the film. The story is set in a fictional Ancient Egypt; where the god Horus (Coster-Waldau) is about to be crowned the king of all of Egypt. Then Horus's vengeful uncle, Set (Butler), kills Horus's father, Osiris (Brown), and steals Horus's eyes; while taking the throne for himself. He plunges the peaceful Egypt into a world of darkness; where citizens must pay their way into the afterlife. A mortal thief, Bek (Thwaites), teams with Horus; to stop Set, and restore Egypt to it's past greatness. Proyas is a very talented director, and he doesn't disappoint here; the script could have used a little more work, but the movie is still a lot of fun. It's entertaining, action-packed and filled with colorful visuals. The performances are all decent enough, but it would have been nice to see a lot more ethnic diversity (if the studio would have just banked on more minority actors). Proyas has listed many reasons (why it was financially safer) to cast the actors he did. If you can overlook that racist injustice, the movie isn't that bad (it's mostly entertaining). Fans of the genre should get a kick out of it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/8JsPKeI7y6U",Gods of Egypt
21,thesar-2,Egypt Has Fallen,4,3 July 2016,"Sorry it took me so long to write this review. I was whitewashing my laundry.I've seen many sword & sandal & the gods movies, from Prince of Persia to Gladiator to Pompeii to Clash of the Titans 1,1,2 and even though the genre is not one I care for, this one probably ranks in the lower half of most of them. It's really just too long, the CGI is eh and the heart of the characters plus the dialogue spoken from them was elementary.But, was it a terrible movie? Not really. I've seen a lot worse. It's a live-action cartoon/video game and probably will appeal to those who like one or both of those. The movie has way too many subplots, plot holes and direction to really narrow our focus and by the movie's merciful end, it's easily forgettable. It doesn't help that we care so little for any of the characters. Even the stolen Aladdin thief was meh.To narrow it down, he who was to be king is of course dethroned before he even gets the throne by, I guess, Uncle Scar and it's up to a god, a thief, an ego and some lovely chick to follow-the-clues and take back the kingdom.Nothing is noteworthy here, but I did laugh out loud at the god's spaceship. Never did I imagine one of the ancient gods having space ships. It's both whaaaat? and WTF at the same time.But, other than that, it's kind of a waste of time. Not the worst, again and if you do like those sword & sandal & the gods movies, you might be a bit interested. But, put it off since there are so many better ones to see first.***Final thoughts: Poor Gerard Butler. Not only is he handsome as hell, but he's not a terrible actor. He just can't get a break with a really good movie. Last one I recall was the super-fun, 24/Die Hard-rip-off: Olympus Has Fallen. He had some good ones before that, but looks like he's not being as trusted these days with good scripts. Just past the half-way point of 2016 and he's already led two huge bombs (including this one.)",Gods of Egypt

23,bowmanblue,"Well, I gave it a go",2,12 April 2017,"Once upon a time there was a director called Alex Proyas who made excellent films which really stuck with me and shaped my youth (think 'The Crow' and 'Dark City'). Even his later, and slightly less well-received, films like 'Knowing' and 'I Robot' were pretty damn good and are often re-watched in my DVD collection. Therefore, when I saw his name attached to 'Gods of Egypt' I naturally knew I'd be watching it. However, I didn't see it immediately and therefore became aware of the general consensus surrounding its appeal. In a nut-shell – everyone hated it! Could this really be true? In short. Yes.I'll tell you now this review is basically just going to be a list of things I hated in the film. Much of the critics' scorn came due to the alleged 'whitewashing' of roles which should really have gone to actors from/or around Egypt. Instead, we were treated to your pretty run-of-the-mill white actors playing characters who hailed from that area of the world. Whether that bugs you or not, it turned out to be the least of the film's sins! Right from the off we meet a good king. We know he's a GOOD king because he's clearly nice and his adoring crowd are all cheering from him. He also has a nice son. We know he's a NICE son because the crowd seem to love him, too. Oh, and he can change into a huge winged beast if he gets angry, but the general populous don't seem to hold that against him. However, mid ceremony, they get attacked by a baddie. We know he's a BADDIE because he's bad and starts killing people before demanding the nation bows down to worship him. Now, I know I'm using some pretty simplistic language, but that's just how the film is – simple. These characters are possibly the most clichéd, wafer-thin, cardboard cut-outs ever to grace modern cinema. The dialogue could be written by a child and it's practically laughable at how basic everything is for such a big budget production. And it doesn't end there. We later meet a young, idealistic hero. Then his love interest. Another baddie or so and yadder, yadder, yadder.And that's just the characters. Once our perfectly-formed hero sets off on his quest to get his girl and kill the bad guy he embarks on a journey that looks like it was created on a Playstation 2. Yes, I know you'd have to use a certain amount of computer-generated effects when dealing with mythical beasts whacking each other on the steps of the pyramids, but this really looks low-budget.Basically, Alex Proyas' directing skills don't go anywhere near to saving this disaster of a film. Okay, I may be being too harsh. I am a fully-grown adult who has been watching films for many years and has pretty much seen it all. Gods of Egypt may have its place for young boys under ten who haven't seen a mythical action film before. Yes, it would probably appeal to them – until they see Indiana Jones or something like that. For everyone else - avoid.",Gods of Egypt
24,ThomasDrufke,Some of the Worst CGI I've Ever Seen,3,3 March 2016,"There are many issues with this film. We can start by the fact that yet another Hollywood blockbuster whitewashes what should have been a diverse cast. But even if you can get past the whitewashing, the film itself is pretty big mess. On its premise alone, it borrows from plenty of films we love including Hercules and The Lion King, but the execution is something else entirely. Sadly, talented director Alex Proyas never manages to create something entertaining or thought provoking out of Gods of Egypt.The films stars Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gerard Butler as Horus and Set, two gods battling it out to be the king of Egypt, Brenton Thwaites as Bek, a mortal who possesses untapped courage, and Elodie Young and Courtney Eaton as the main love interests. As I said, the story isn't all that terrible, the performances and execution of the story is horrific. For a 140 million-dollar film, Gods of Egypt may be the worst looking film I've ever seen. I'm not sure who is in charge of controlling how the budget is being used for this film, but it was not a good job of properly distributing the time and money. Whether it's watching Butler fly through the sky or a halfway decent action scene, the green screen is blatantly obvious.After a good portion of the 2 hour and 7 minute film, my eyes began to drift. That never happens to me during an action film. I just never found myself caring for the characters. Not necessarily to the fault of the actors, but they didn't do all that much to help their cause. The performances were subpar at best, and even the one really great actor, Chadwick Boseman, was completely wasted. I'm not sure whose idea it was to have Thwaites yell like Tarzan or George of the jungle every time he fell or jumped off rocks, but that was not the best decision to make. Even Jaime Lannister couldn't save this one. I hope to god that London Has Fallen doesn't make it back to back horrible Gerard Butler films.Alex Proyas went on a social media rant over the wretched reviews the film has received. Even after I went in with even lower expectations because of this, I wasn't impressed in the slightest. I never saw Clash or Wrath of the titans, but I can't help but think the sword and sandal epic is officially dead. The best bet for studios is to stick to what works, and that's disappointing, because this genre has turned out some of my favorite films of all time in Gladiator and Braveheart.+Some of the action and story potential-Horrific CGI-Weak and uninteresting characters-Boseman wasted-Whitwashed3.6/10",Gods of Egypt

But it deserves a second glance. This film is in the grand tradition of the famous 1940s fantasy films like THIEF OF BAGDAD 1940 (recommended!).These films are neither as logical as a STAR TREK saga nor as linear as an Indiana Jones adventure. By nature, they tend to jump around, they tend to be a bit wacky, and they often encourage outlandish performances from their stars.Which is what we have here. The #1 A-List name star, Gerard Butler has arguably never been more unrestrained in his career. He gives the impression that, after he takes over the world of the living and the world of the dead, his next target is Hollywood itself.In fact, the lesser known stars give the better textured performances and connect with the audience.Give it a chance -- as a love story that riffs off some extremely misunderstood Egyptian myths and succeeds in spite of itself, it works a treat.",Gods of Egypt

Never been that big into mythology and the epic BC movies have never really interested me all that much. I'm not sure if that had something to do with this or not but I didn't enjoy this movie at all. The dialog is awful, the story is confusing; mainly because it couldn't decide what it wanted to be.

Inlaid with overblown special effects and abysmal performances from a fair-skinned cast, this whitewashed construct of an alternative Egypt is grossly inaccurate, insulting and inane all at the same time.Furthermore, with all of their internal organs removed, Egyptians had plenty of room to store spare change for any afterlife tolls.

30,ironhorse_iv,"Don't be in de Nile! You know, damn well, this movie wasn't good. However, it's not as bad, as people make it out to be",5,24 March 2016,"It's a shame, this movie wasn't as good as it could had been. It always looked like it would could had work. After all, this is the first time in a long time that Hollywood is showing the mythological side of the Ancient Egypt that has nothing to do with Curses or Mummies. Because of that, the premise of this film does sounded reasonably cool. Plus, I like how the movie is based on the Osiris myth. That myth is the most elaborate and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns the murder of the god Osiris (Bryan Brown) by his brother, Set (Gerard Butler), wanting to be primeval king of Egypt, with the remainder of the story focuses on Osiris's son, Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) trying to capture the throne, and restore order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign. While, this myth is best known for its complex symbolism, which is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order and disorder, and especially death and the afterlife. The consequences of this clumsy retelling is that the audience got very confused. After all, not a lot of people know, of this story, nor does a lot of people know, how to even show this story. In their defense, I have to say, director Alex Proyas and his staff of writers and filmmakers did alright job in world-building. Yes, they made no attempt at historical accuracy, but as a fantasy movie, it somewhat works. The movie's world was indeed, unique to look at. However, there were some really jarring choices that I wish, they didn't do, such as focusing too much on the extreme action and huge fake-looking green-screen set pieces, rather than making the story seem like it kinda makes sense. At times the action resembles elements of an old school video game. After all, whenever, the deities fight in this movie, its fast mix with slow motion flying shots is essentially ripping off, 2008's film 'Iron Man' with of 2013's film 'Man of Steel'. It made the film seem so far-fetched and ridiculous, than realistic. I lost count on how many plot holes and unexplained story elements were present within this movie. Also, it seem that they cut a lot of things, out of the Osiris myth, like the whole idea of the story being about Osiris's resurrection. Instead, the filmmakers change it, by having a mortal thief, Bek, (Brenton Thwaites) seeking resurrection for his dead lover, Zaya (Courtney Eaton) by helping Horus recaptured the throne, before she gets judge in the underworld for the chance for afterlife. In my opinion, I found this added element to the story to be the weakest part. It's not like the mixer of mortal characters and the deities couldn't work, it's just the fact, that they made the deities so much, larger in height than the human characters. It's not like the 'Lord of the Ring' films (2001-2003) which only show the height different between the hobbits with other creatures, so rarely. In this film, the humans follow the much larger Gods, in every scene in the film. It's so distracting. Like the artificial-looking CGI backgrounds, it really took me out of the movie. I would rather, have the human characters, be the same size as the Gods. Another thing that bug me about this film is the white-wash of the Egyptian culture. There is barely any African, Arabic or Egyptian actors in this film at all. Honestly, what is a Scottish, Danish, and Australian crew of actors, doing in a movie, based in Egyptian mythological!? At least, get actors that look like, they are from that area like, they did, for 1994's Sci-Fi film 'Stargate'. It would have made a little more sense, than what we got here. Also, the acting in this movie from them, wasn't the best, since their characters weren't that fresh out to begin with. Everybody is one-dimensional as hell, and have little to no depth whatever. Yes, they did, try some character development with Horus and Bek, on learning to work with each other, but it come off, as underdeveloped. At least, the movie didn't add the myth part, where Osiris's wife, Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. Now, that's creepy. Also, at least, the music by Marco Beltrami was entertaining, even if it's sounds so generic. Overall: While, I will give it kudos for being ambitious and trying something, ""different"". In the end, all of the people that work on this film, work seem mediocre, as well. It's pretty bad. But there are some bad movies that are at least enjoyably so; we can derive pleasure from them even as we understand they're not the craft at its finest, and in some ways, 'Gods of Egypt' can at least fall into that category. I can't recommend seeing it, but if you do, it's somewhat watchable. Go see the movie for yourself and make your own educated opinion. If you like cheesy fantasy movies, then you will enjoy this flick.",Gods of Egypt

I think the Hollywood fed up with Greek stuffs, now they're looking at the ancient Egypt. Where's the next stop? India? This film was not a bad idea. I liked the story, a mission based concept, but I did not like the CGI. Visually, it was okay, though those CGI characters felt like they're from sci-fi. I think they inspired by the ancient Egyptian arts. Other than that, this film is enjoyable.At least I knew about Greek deities, I learnt a few words and names about Egypt mythology through this. Gerard Butler in a negative shade was good and the other actors too decent. I was not interested in this film, but now somewhat I enjoyed it, that mean they should stop it here, no sequel please.I had no issue with the casting, it is a marketing strategy. You can't just put a new foreign face in front of the camera and make money out of it. Cinema itself means fake display. Age, skin, death, everything is fake. So people must learn to accept it similar to when a black, Malaysian or Indonesian man says he's a mooslim, but genetically he's not, just converted to.Well composed stunt sequences, especially bloods with liquid gold, totally got the PG13. Least expected film of the year, but got entertained better. It got the mixed response and mostly negative feedback from the critics, but who knows you might have a good time like I did.

32,tomgillespie2002,Utter tripe,2,12 July 2016,"Alex Proyas's return to directing following a 7 year hiatus couldn't have come at a worse time. Just as the film industry was up in arms about the #OscarSoWhite debacle, Gods of Egypt arrived in cinemas boasting a near-all Caucasian cast despite being set in Africa. The demand for diversity in Hollywood duly followed, and rightly so, but the questionable casting isn't even the worst thing about the film. Gods of Egypt is a bloated, garish and nonsensical piece of trash, the cinematic equivalent of Raheem Sterling's bathroom. Is this really the same visionary who brought us The Crow (1994) and Dark City (1998)?Sadly it is, and it completes a steady quality decline in Proyas's output which began in 2004 with his middle-finger to Isaac Asimov, I, Robot. On paper, the big-budget tale of Gods living amongst humans battling it out for the throne may seem like the perfect the opportunity for some campy, brain-on-auto-pilot fun. However, it fails to even offer any sort of camp appeal due to a cast either gobbled up by the video-game cutaway special effects or so utterly devoid of charisma. The main offender is Brenton Thwaites, a young actor who looks like he's been custom-built to appeal to any teenage girls in the crowd. He plays Bek, a human living in a thriving Egypt governed by ten-foot Gods, and sadly he is our protagonist.Bek, along with his pretty girlfriend Zaya (Courtney Eaton), witnesses the handing-over of the crown from the abdicating Osiris (Bryan Brown) to his dashing and popular son Horus (Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau). The coronation is rudely interrupted by Osiris's uncle Set (Gerard Butler), who feels that the time has come for him to rule, killing his brother and ripping out his poor nephew's eyes in front of a terrified crowd. With the Egyptians forced into slavery to satisfy Set's greed and vanity, Bek, a talented thief, swipes the plans to Set's vault in the hope of stealing back Horus's eyes and assisting him in defeating his uncle. But when Zaya is killed after the successful theft, Bek strikes a deal with Horus to help guide him through Set's pyramid in exchange for returning Zaya from the underworld.The main question lingering over the head of Gods of Egypt is why was this film made? For a modern blockbuster from a talented director, the film lacks maturity and brains. For a film possibly designed to appeal to fans of explosion-heavy sci-fi/fantasy extravaganzas such as Michael Bay's Transformers franchise, the CGI is often embarrassingly bad. And for anybody hoping for a throwback to the kitschy B-movies of the 1950's and 60's, where giant monsters and grotesque gods mingled with us puny humans, you will find more charm in one frame of any movie involving the work of Ray Harryhausen than you will for the entire 2 hours of Gods of Egypt. The whole thing just feels oddly out of place, paling in comparison to even the most sickly of recent CGI-fests. Re-telling essentially the exact same story told a thousand times since Homer put ink to paper, this could be re-titled as A Simpleton's Guide to the Hero's Quest. Utter tripe.",Gods of Egypt
33,Floated2,Generic and boring,2,23 October 2019,"Nothing too much of noteworthy entertaining in this film. As expected did not enjoy the film and seeing its rating after watching this film, am not surprised at its current 5.4 IMDB rating.Not particularly too fond of these Greek/Egypt mythology, ancient historical type films but have enjoyed a few. Seeing comparisons with this film to Clash of the Titans, but even though that film isn't great, it is easily more entertaining and enjoyable than Gods of Egypt.This film as a whole was quite generic, bland and overly long. A story that is predictable and doesn't really offer much of anything new or fresh. Decent visuals but that is to be expected considering its large budget. This was a massive box office flop (noticeable domestic wise) and after viewing this film, one isn't surprised in the slightest.",Gods of Egypt
34,leonblackwood,Looks great but the storyline was poor. 5/10,5,8 September 2016,"Review: After an epic beginning, I was quite impressed with this movie but the storyline was all over the place. The director kept on adding new elements, which spoilt the flow of the movie, which could have been much simpler if he would have just stuck to the good vs. evil concept. The main character, Bek (Brenton Thwaites), was quite annoying throughout the film but Gerard Butler was great as the evil Set. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau also played Horus quite well and the extravagant scenery was well put together by the director but it did look a bit over the top in places. He certainly took full advantage of today's CGI abilities but the epic journey did seem slightly unrealistic. In terms of entertainment, it reminded me of John Carter, which also had a massive budget but it didn't really smash the box office, and I can just imagine how hard it must have been for the actors, who spent most of the time talking and fighting against objects that wasn't really there. It was good to see Butler back in 300 mode, and Geoffrey Rush was great as Ra but the storyline really let this movie down, which is a shame because all of the efforts which were put into the visual effects, was pretty good. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Alex Proyas, 52, who also brought you the Crow in 1994, Dark City, I, Robot in 2004, with Will Smith and Knowing in 2009, with Nicolas Cage. He's not one to take on many projects, because I can just imagine how long this film and some of his previous movies, must have taken to make. He definitely has a track record of using a lot of visual effects, so this project was a great choice for him but the writing really wasn't that great. It was written by Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpness, who also brought you Dracula Untold, The Last Witch Hunter and the upcoming Power Rangers movie, so judging by there previous projects, I'm not surprised with the way that this movie turned out. I was expecting it to make more money at the box office but it obviously didn't go down too well with audiences. The critics didn't put it down like they did with John Carter but it still seemed to come in and out of the top ten for that period, really quickly. Budget: $140million Worldwide Gross: $146millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/fantasy/adventure movies, starring Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Bryan Brown, Chadwick Boseman, Rufus Sewell, Courtney Eaton, Elodie Yung and Geoffrey Rush. 5/10",Gods of Egypt

36,subxerogravity,Think I understand why there are more movies on the Greek Gods than the Egyptian ones.,5,29 February 2016,"Wow! this movie stunk. What a disappointment, and I herd they dump a lot of money into it.Off the top, the CGI in the movie was so overwhelming, the movie should have been animated. I don't even understand why they just didn't. It would be one thing if it was good CGI, but it was bad CGI. I think the movie suffers from the fact that they were doing something new with the Egyptian gods being bigger than man and having to match that up (of course that does not explain the other effects). Definitively nothing to brag about, just made my eyes water. Not fully familiar with all the Gods of Egypt and I was hoping this movie would change that. I don't know if the movie was using a actual tale of the Gods or was this an original story starring the Gods of Egypt. Either way the story was bland. Most of this had to do with both heroes of the movie, Horus the god and Bek the mortal by his side, being so uninteresting. I thought the supporting cast was a lot better. Chadwick Boseman as Thoth was amusing and so was Gerard Butler as Set (but I don't think that was the plan). The two girls that are in the movie are beautiful, but forgettable in their roles, plus Geoffrey Rush was kind of a waste of time.I have to say skip this one, definitely. There is not enough positive elements in the movie that justify going to see it.It's a real snooze.",Gods of Egypt
37,billcr12,God vs God,4,19 June 2016,"This looks like one of those old Cecille B. DeMille biblical epics of the 1960s with much better special effects, due to modern CGI techniques. Instead of Old Testament rivals, we get Horus and Get battling for the soul of Egypt. Get is a god of darkness and Horus is the good guy; or god of light. The opening features a fight between the two, which results in the bad guy plucking out the good guys eyeballs. The obligatory mortal hero comes along to assist Horus in regaining Egypt while also attempting to reunite with his one true love. The only recognizable actor is Gerard Butler as Get; in a similar role he did in ""300."" The script is rather silly but the CGI is spectacular. Gods of Egypt needs to be seen on a big screen.

38,BeneCumb,Another predictable and protracted story where visual effects steal the show,5,10 September 2017,"With the development and spread of digital technology, many filmmakers have wanted to fulfill their past dreams of creating something visually powerful and with smooth inclusion, with a wow! effect for viewers in front of big screens. Thus, no more drawings within feature films or aliens resembling vessels of war, but fairy-tales, myths and sci-fi unfolding in a compact and truthful manner. Alas, this has often involved vain scripts, focusing on battles and motions, and over-the-shaft scenes for the sake of length and visualization. Besides, the cast is uneven, many characters come close to the ones seen before in other movies; even talented non-US character actors like Geoffrey Rush or Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are unable to fill the vacuity, the rest are nothing special - or too much ""hidden"" behind flashing environment and covering costumes. Lots of scenes are too long or provide no additional value, repeating obvious issues again and again.If it was the 1st movie of a kind, I would probably have rated it higher, but in 2016, it is just a copycat of dozens of myth-based movies of this millennium.

But it was not that bad, and some effects are alright in parts but kind of see threw in some.But the performances except for Chadwick Boseman and Geoffrey Rush who seem the make there parts memorable. But everybody else looks there kind of sleepwalking through or look uninterested being here, even Gerard Butler who has the look like he just walked out of bar, and seems like he is doing an off color parody of his 300(2006) character.

According to this version, the Gods live among the mere mortal humans in Egypt. Of course, they tower over the humans, standing at about 10 feet tall. I really liked the way they showed the contrast between their heights, whenever the Gods and humans were in the same scene.It looked pretty cool. Nikolaj plays Horus, the God of air, who is next in line to be king of Egypt. Gerard plays Set, the God of darkness and the current kings' brother and uncle to Nikolaj, who thinks that he should be the next king instead of his wimpy nephew. Brenton plays a mortal that is in love with Courtney, also a mortal, and they both get caught up in the Gods' battle over Egypt. I remember reading a lot of mythology back in high school-a looong time ago-and enjoying it a lot. I used to watch those old movies like 'Jason and the Argonauts', 'The Clash of the Titans' and 'Hercules'. Now there was some controversy about the casting of white actors in the Egyptian roles but I don't know, I still enjoyed the movie. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and some sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes. I really liked this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Gods of Egypt
42,alindsay-al,An awful mess of a film,1,22 June 2016,"I have seen quite a few movies this year and I have finally seen a film that is just truly awful and just hilariously bad. The premise of the film sees mortal Beck having to get the help from disgraced god horas to stop the evil king set and save his true love. Now to start the actors that play horas and Beck didn't have any chemistry between them and neither performance was interesting at all. I especially found Beck annoying which means when I was meant to care about him I just didn't. Gerard butler plays the villain set and even though he is totally cliché and over the top he was easily the most entertaining part of this film. Chadwick boseman played black panther brilliantly in captain America civil war but he was just a cartoon in this film even though like butler he was pretty entertaining. Elodie young fresh off playing elektra in daredevil season 2 doesn't have much to do in this film and her character comes across as unnecessary. Becs girlfriend also has no character and is just an attractive girl with not loads of acting talent. The story is as basic and generic as you can get, there is no uniqueness to the story and everything involved and you have seen it all before. The script has some pretty cringe worthy dialogue that comes across as forced whether it be dramatic or humorous. The style has some of the worst cgi I have ever seen and it is pretty clear that the budget for the film just wasn't big enough for what they wanted to do. Overall this film is really bad and just not worth your time.",Gods of Egypt
43,TdSmth5,Good fantasy action,8,15 June 2016,"Gods of Egypt takes place at a time when gods lived on earth among humans. Ra lives on a boat in the sky and has to battle Chaos ever day. His son Osiris rules over the fertile lands of Egypt while his other son Set rules over the desert. It's time for Osiris to cede the throne to his son Horus. During the ceremony, Set shows up, kills Osiris, blinds Horus, takes his girl Hathor--the goddess of love, kills some other gods and takes their power and names himself king of all Egypt. Why gods need to be kings as well, I don't know.Now Horus is banished somewhere while Set is busy building a giant Obelisk to honor Ra. He also plans on obtaining more power by killing more gods and eventually letting Chaos rule. The story is told through the eyes of two humans, some young hustler named Bek and his gorgeous girlfriend Zaya. Bek doesn't have faith in the gods, Zaya believes that Horus will return and re-take the throne and make everything right again. Set's first decision was to institute payment for those who die and want to enter the afterlife. Those who can't afford it end up in some dark hellish cloud, not sure if they die completely or what. Zaya works for Set's architect who is building the obelisk. Zaya suggests Bek steal Horus's eyes which Set is keeping in one of his buildings since she has access to all the plans. Bek succeeds in recovering one eye but during some battles Zaya is killed. She embarks on her long journey to the afterlife but has nothing to offer once she arrives at the place where ""justice"" is meted out.Bek now searches for and finds Horus and gives him the eye and tries to convince him to retake his rightful place. Hathor also joins them, she feels for Bek who is in love. They offer Bek that they'll bring Zaya back knowing full well it's impossible.What follows then is a series of adventures as these guys try to make it back to the city to confront Set. Ra will also play a role as does Toth, the god of wisdom. It will all resolve in some battles between the gods.Gods of Egypt delivers some fantastic sights. Some of the CGI doesn't convince but a lot looks really great. While most movies like to emphasize darkness and film as much as possible at night, Gods of Egypt thankfully focuses on brightness and daylight. The mythology is fascinating but unfortunately not really the focus of this movie. The humans of course aren't all that interesting. Courtney Eaton though is absolutely stunning. While the cast is strong, acting isn't up to par. Even though we're dealing here with grandiose events, acting is subdued and we get a wide range from the good to the terrible, as in the case of the individual playing the God of Wisdom.Gods of Egypt while not quite as spectacular as it could have been is a good-looking movie with an interesting and unique mythology.",Gods of Egypt

Gods of Egypt is pretty much what you would expect from a action/fantasy film.This flick takes a basic myth based framework and tweaks it to present a passable, predominantly exposition based, eye candy orientated film with a small side order of morality tale. That's not to say Gods of Egypt isn't entertaining. I'd argue its light weight, simple fun, thats probably going to look good on a large screen LCD with a surround sound system. Don't for a moment consider taking this film seriously, it might have a reasonable cast and not half bad acting but it is, what it is, an action film first and foremost. I enjoyed Gods of Egypt, its well paced and quite watchable. A good one to share with friends and family over some chips and popcorn. Six out of ten from me.",Gods of Egypt
45,peterp-450-298716,Lots of gods. It's not divine. It's not Asylum either. Thank God.,5,18 June 2016,"""A gift from someone with great assets, and someone with very few. But when both die and are at the Final Gate... What is its value? I say we are equal.""I thought this would be something similar like ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"". A historical story set in Egypt with immense scenery's and an abundance of special effects. Well, it certainly is situated in Egypt. And the bag of tricks, full of kitsch and console-game-like special effects were exploited to the utmost. Only, now it's not about a biblical figure but the mythological world of Egypt. Ancient Egypt where people and gods live alongside each other. It sometimes resembled ""Gulliver's Travels"" since all those gods of Egypt have an imposing figure compared to the ordinary mortals. Ultimately, it's a kind of historical ""Transformers"". So, full of exaggerated action and impressive transformations into imaginative creatures.From the opening shot, it's clear where the biggest amount of money was spent on. A gliding flight over the Egyptian landscape and arriving in a busy shopping street of Egypt. I thought this was already a delight to watch. We get to know Bek (Brenton ""The Giver"" Thwaites), a kind of Aladdin and a petty thief who succeeds in stealing a (probably in those days) fashionable gown for his beloved Zaya (Courtney ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" Eaton). And this leads us to the second, unavoidable story : the idyllic love affair. An Egyptian couple with a bright future in front of them and who'll ultimately be victims of the core story. Eternal love, divine adoration for each other and languorous glances, are the obnoxious symptoms we are witnessing. Granted, it wasn't overly annoying. And also this story introduces the most eye-catching prop of the entire movie. That heaving bosom of Eaton. I am almost sure that it does not comply with the usual proportions of that era, but it was the only thing that could distract me from all the other epic violence.Obviously you should watch this spectacle movie without thinking and let yourself be overwhelmed by the lavish fantasy world. The only thing that bothered me was that they tried to cram the entire Egyptian mythological world in this film. As a result, the pacing is scorching high. You've only just put yourself down in your cozy chair and two over-sized gods are already rolling all over the city center. A sort of re-introduction of ""King Kong vs. Godzilla"". And so one action-packed scene after the other passes by. The fascinating situation about Anubis and the Underworld, two giant snakes writhing over a huge maze or some ""Tomb Raider"" platform stunt-work in the temple of Set (Gerald Butler). You won't get bored. The most fascinating and crazy part was reserved for Geoffrey ""Barbossa"" Rush as the god Ra who's pulling the sun with his floating spacecraft around a disc-shaped earth. I instantly wanted to reread books by Terry Pratchett.Concerning content you shouldn't expect too much. And sometimes it's quite illogical. Of course those gods always tend to have an easy solution when a problem occurs, which is an advantage for the subsequent course of the story. You can predict the outcome already from an Egyptian mile away. That's no surprise either. And also the CGI wasn't top notch sometimes in this sword-and-sandal. But this film is mainly judged based on the trailer (which I obviously haven't seen because I try to avoid them studiously) and therefor is ripped to pieces by critics. Yet I find this somewhat exaggerated.Well it's true. At all levels it doesn't contain any profundity. But what do you expect of this type of movie? Highly intellectual conversations and thoughtful screenplay? You also don't expect in a movie such as ""Schindler's List"" diabolical fright moments or exciting car chases with stirring music? ""God of Egypt"" showed what I was expecting. Over the top spectacle and action which is digitally displayed in a partially successful way. It effortlessly transcends the level of any Asylum movie.

It will never be confused with a movie that changes either yourself or tries to develop our society by asking the hard questions. But it is a movie that, if you are into the genre, will leave you thoroughly entertained. And that is something to approve of, not to look down upon.Set in the mythical Egypt, the god Set usurps the crown of Egypt from his nephew Osiris. On a quest for power, Set hunts down anyone who stand against him, mortal or god alike. Only Bek, a carefree thief who tries to save his beloved Zaya, dares to challenge the authority of Set. But he needs help, and together with the ""fallen"" Horus, they embark on an epic journey.The story is not much to talk about. A classic fight between good and evil, between brothers and a fight for supremacy. It is ripe with adventure and action. It is the basis needed of movie with the aim to entertain through action. And action there is a lot, both in the form of dueling, fighting and negotiating perilous mazes and monsters. It is also lightened up with a tongue in cheek flair, mostly through the character Bek, that give the movie quite a few humorous moments. The visual aspect should not be neglected. It is colorful and uses CGI quite heavily, but it works well set in the mythical world. I think most of it was done very well.The cast, with quite a lot of known names in it (notably Butler, Coaster-Waldau and Rush) and a few new ones that might be well known further on. This movie will not be the one that bring them prizes, but they perform well within the story, and give their character's traits credibility.

47,adamjohns-42575,A perfectly acceptable watch.,5,5 February 2021,"I didn't mind this film, it's the type of thing you can put on one Saturday afternoon and it doesn't matter if someone drops by or if you have to go to the loo, you can just leave it running, because it's a fairly simple storyline with a very obvious ending, which lets face it we've all see before in one film or another. Sometimes easy films are just what we need.According to the IMDB Trivia section IT IS based on an Egyptian Legend/Myth/Religion? But I prefer to look at it as a complete work of fantasy fiction, because it would just be too complicated to try to understand all of the Gods and their relationships and how true to the original papyrus texts this story might be. It's also because I don't think you can even vaguely think of this as anything but fiction, so extreme and fanciful is it that you would never believe it.I actually think it might have worked better as a cartoon/CGI film. Their voices all worked fine for that, but came across as a bit corny otherwise. In fact it was a bit hammy too and quite a lot of cheesey as well. You could have made a picnic out of it all with the Beefy men on top of the rest (I wish Gerrard Butler was on top of me).It's difficult to distinguish Nikolaj from his role as Jaime Lannister in 'Game Of Thrones' and in actual fact I think he would have worked better if he'd swapped roles with Gerrard and vice-versa. They are both very handsome fellas, so I don't mind too much, but the guy playing Bek was just annoyingly bad.
I'm assuming that it was a directors choice to go down the route of Cheese and Ham, because I've definitely seen these actors do better. The star in the mix was Geoffrey Rush, who, although a very extreme character, managed to keep his Ra acceptable for any film.I also didn't know what was wrong with Chadwick Bozeman's voice, it was a bit all over the place. It was almost as frustrating as Gerrard's eye liner and hair dye job.In the right studio, producer and directors hands and even with the same cast, I think that this story could actually be made very well, but it would have to be a proper epic with the time and budget to match or a Netflix series to rival 'Thrones'.",Gods of Egypt

And the answer is a resounding yes! A dumb glitzy fantasy that is closer to Vegas' Luxor than any Egyptian wonder. Adequately directed by Alex Proyas, with a feeble script by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless (yet another yes), the movie is overproduced and makes no sense at all. It resembles a video game rather than a film, with one obstacle after the next and its CGI is mostly cheap looking and schlocky. The story (?) involves in-fighting among the gods as a common thief tries to save his Jasmine princess. The gods are titans amid puny mortal Munchkins, as they raise havoc on the masses. There's lots of action, sci-fi creatures. and the men's pecs compete largely with the women's cleavage to gain fanboys' attention. But the movie is unintentionally laughable from the start and never can be remotely believable, due to the many outlandish sets and glittery skimpy costumes, not to mention the terrible dialog. (A majority of the film's budget must have been spent on gold lamé.)NIkolaj Coaster-Waldau, whose character lost his hand in the superior Game of Thrones, loses two eyes in this mess and most of his dignity within the first half hour. Gerald Butler plays his mean uncle and he grimaces his way through the film. Newcomer Brenton Thwaites lets his long flowing hair do the acting and should omit this sword and sandal wallow from his resume. Élodie Yung wears her showgirl outfits like the goddess she is.

They're like the Velvet Underground of movie subgenres, they may never be popular in their own time but they inspire countless film professionals with their bountiful style, unorthodox special effects and simple but effective story- lines. Where would the world of special effects be without Ray Harryhausen's work on Jason and the Argonauts (1963)? Would we know the name Sergio Leone without the famed director first cutting his teeth on the peplum film The Last Days of Pompeii (1959)? I dare not put the ghastly Gods of Egypt in the same category as Conan the Barbarian (1982) or Clash of the Titans (1981) but I do put it a head above the 2010 remake of Clash of the Titans.Mortal thief Bek (Thwaites) and his love Zaya (Eaton) are trusted into a web of palace intrigue after benevolent God Osiris (Brown) is struck down by his brother Set (Butler) in a public display of brutality meant to keep mortals and other Gods in line. Osiris's son Horus (Coster-Waldau) attempts to take vengeance but his magical eyes are plucked from his skull and he's banished. Bek steals one of the eyes from Set's newly constructed vault thus turning the wheels of the plot, ultimately resulting in a rematch between Horus and his uncle.As garish as the sets are and as conspicuous as the computer generated effects may be, the movie is not without its inner-logic which works if you forgive some minor missteps. The characters are weak and uninspired but they all have perfectly respectable character arcs. What's more the precious moments of mirth are genuine in a cheesy Flash Gordon (1980) kind of way. The first act borders on self-parody and the last act is a-clutter with mindless action yet in-spite of all this, I think I caught myself actually enjoying the movie a few times. Yes, believe it or not Gods of Egypt is not entirely irredeemable.Don't get me wrong; it's goofy, it's dumb and it's loud; it's whitewashed to the point of cultural insensitivity, and it surrenders to some occasionally unsettling themes but none of these factors are important when faced with the film's endgame; it's here to entertain, that's it. With a bar set that low, it's easy to find a lot to like. Those with a thirst for blood and sinew will be glad to know that despite a PG-13 rating, the film showcases a lot of gleeful violence and action. They get away with it only because the blood of the Gods is gold not red. I personally enjoyed the application of certain Ancient Egyptian mythology, especially moments involving Ra (Rush), the granddaddy of the Gods, pulling the sun across the sky in his celestial catamaran.Gods of Egypt cannot compare to the middling mythological epics of Italy circa 1950's. Heck, it can even compare to 300 (2006) which provided the template for so many of these goof-ball celebrations of male bravado. Director Alex Proyas knows the script for Gods of Egypt isn't exactly Shakespeare and maximizes all the points of entertainment while still telling a cogent tale. The results are crude but effective.",Gods of Egypt
54,moviexclusive,"Loud, dumb and silly, this overstuffed god-versus-mortals epic still delivers two hours of solid swashbuckling adventure, romance, epic CG battles and sheer visual grandeur",6,26 February 2016,"History is replete with the follies of Hollywood's gods-versus- mortals epics that have since faded into ignominy or is remembered with scorn, so much so that it is almost instinct to wonder which 'Gods of Egypt' will turn out to be, especially given its pre- release criticism about its literally white-washed cast. Yet Alex Proyas' first film in seven years deserves much better regard than the toxic buzz it has been getting – not only is it one of the more imaginative mythological adventures in recent years, it is also one of the most entertaining by simply not taking itself too seriously.Imagining an ancient Egypt that never existed where gods and men live together, this effects-driven CGI extravaganza pits the benevolent if slightly flirtatious lord of the air Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) against the nefarious desert god Set (Gerard Butler) who usurps his throne of Egypt on the day of his coronation. As with most such power tussles, there is a familial dimension – Set is in fact Horus' uncle, who isn't just resentful that his father, the sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush), had given rule of Egypt to Horus but also seemingly banished him to a bleak and barren wasteland. So Set kills his brother Osiris (Bryan Brown) and blinds Horus, exiling him to some faraway dune to wallow in self-pity and eternal misery.That opening sets the stage for Horus to embark on a journey of self-discovery on his way to reclaiming the throne, with immeasurable help from a mortal thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites). It is Bek who returns Horus one of his eyes after breaking into Set's seemingly impenetrable vault, who also subsequently accompanies Horus on his quest in exchange for passage for his one true love Zaya (Courtney Eaton) back from the underworld. And so begins a series of razzle-dazzle action sequences, including a thrilling chase by two evil goddesses Astarte (Abbey Lee) and Anat (Yaya Deng) atop two giant fire-breathing serpents and a near-death escape from Set with some help from Elodie Yung's goddess of love Hathor inside the chamber of a towering Sphinx.Oh yes, there is no such thing as subtlety here. The chariots are pulled by giant scarab beetles. Sedan chairs take flight with hundreds of birds. Gods transform from their 11, 12 feet in height human form into glistening animal-headed robots and bleed liquid gold. Ra lives in a spaceship hovering above the Earth, bursts into flames at will and spends each night doing battle with the Lovecraftian ancient Apep by shooting fireballs from his spear. Indeed, as far as being gaudy is concerned, Proyas isn't shy at all about flaunting every single dollar of his significant US$140 million budget that went into creating the sheer visual spectacle (or excess, depending on how you see it) that you'll get to see on the big screen.Yet its silliness certainly isn't lost on Proyas; indeed, along with his writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ('Dracula Untold' and 'The Last Witch Hunter'), Proyas gleefully embraces its absurdity with campy humour. For one, Bek is never too far from an amusing quib usually directed at Bek. For another, the god of wisdom Thoth (Chadwick Boseman) is a ball being haughty and all full of himself – and we mean that literally in the context of the hundreds of copies he has made of himself to serve him in his lair. It never does take itself too seriously, nor too flippantly to be completely dismissed, and the levity is a nice counter-balance to the elaborate kitsch on display.Credit that too to Coaster-Waldau and Thwaites, who sustain a lively bickersome chemistry as a pair of mismatched buddies forced to work together rather than apart. For the ladies, Coaster-Waldau also oozes sheer masculine charm, while Butler often chews up the scenery with pomp and swagger. Both actors are no stranger to the swords-and- sandals genre – the former from the HBO series 'Game of Thrones' and the latter of course from '300' – and have no trouble convincing us of their place in Egyptian mythology. Rush also lends his trademark eccentricity to Ra, looking just at home on his solar barque.And so like last summer's 'Hercules', 'Gods of Egypt' rises above the ashes by delivering two hours of solid sword-and-sorcery entertainment with dashes of self-aware humour. There is swashbuckling adventure, romance, epic battles and plenty of visual grandeur to meet its mad ambition with lunatic conviction. That it is overstuffed is part of its excessive nature, but you can't argue that it doesn't fill you with a sense of awe and captivate and delight you more than you expect it to.",Gods of Egypt

Unfortunately for the two hours movie, its visual is inconsistent and the story has so many illogical flaws, that whatever gorgeous scenery it has would feel bland. Furthermore, the acting is sloppy, having less-than-charismatic characters mumbling cringe-worthy monologue for half its time.This is the tedious story of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the supposed king of fictional Egypt where gods and mortals live side by side. He then finds opposition from his uncle Set (Gerard Butler). He then forms unusual alliance with Bek (Brenton Thwaites), a human thief with a single-minded drive for juvenile love.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gerard Butler are not bad, they have experience on this type of epic saga as Jaime Lannister and Leonidas, respectively. However, this also feels as though they are just going through the motion. Here they are shades, less appealing and more brooding version of their famous roles.Bek as the other main lead is your typical charming hoodlum without the charm. His characterization is too rigid and any attempt to romanticized or deliver witty humor is instead annoying. The two leading females are too over zealously created for flamboyant melodramatic romance. There are a couple decent supporting cast such as Rufus Sewell as Urshu and Chadwick Boseman as Thoth, but they merely have small portions of spotlight.The script feels forced to create any chemistry between the characters, however it often sounds like soap opera. Not to mention story line is plagued by awful plot devices. Being gods doesn't exemplify them from having sudden illogical and convenient twists, a few of these might be fine, but after half dozen times audience would appreciate more explanation than simple magic.Visual is arguably pretty. At its best the movie offers some aesthetically pleasing scenes and the costumes worn as well as the set are very easy on the eyes. Still, among these beautiful people and vistas, it's not often to see it smeared by strangely subpar CGI, as though these are Transformers made from low budget production.Tainted by shady narrative, corrupted visual and barren script, ""Gods of Egypt"" is mindlessly numb.",Gods of Egypt

57,Screen_Blitz,A two-hour epic of bloated CGI and total cinematic nonsense,1,7 June 2016,"Many movie buffs may know by now that the first three months of the year consist of some of Hollywood's biggest letdowns of the year, even big-budget epics starring a few A-list actors are immune to failure. When it comes to the action-epic genre, however, the last thing we need is a fantasy adventure that descends on the level of ""so bad, it's good"" or just laughably bad. This Epygtian mythology-based fantasy epic directed by Alex Proyas who directed by criminally forgotten 'Dark City' and the surprisingly entertaining 'I,Robot', may fit in this category but it doesn't escape the ridiculously messy, CGI-crowded train wreck this is. The most difficult task to endure while sitting through this flick is spotting a single redeeming quality during the two-hour mess. This film stars Gerard Butler as Set, the god of darkness in ancient Egypt who grows jealously over the sun god'a position as King and decides to take over the throne, leading the formerly peaceful empire to plunge into chaos. With the empire gripping in fear of his reign, young thief Bek (played by Brenton Thwaites) sets out to defeat Set and save his girlfriend Maya (played by Courtney Eaton) who is held captive, with the help of Horus (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the powerful god of the desert fighting by his side. It is difficult tell whether this is supposed a parody of big-budget epic flicks or just another fantasy flick tainted by unintentionally bad script. Either way, this movie fails miserably. Whethers it's the horrendous visual effects, the stunted acting, the painfully incoherent plot, or the overall lousy script; this movie seems to have no idea what it's trying to be. The film begins a shiny bird's eye view of the Egyptian empire that is nice to look until the camera pans down for a closer view of the environment. With the villages looking like sets we may find in a high school play and the bloated use of lightening, results in a painfully unconvincing production design representing Ancient Egypt. The rest of the time, we are left with settings consisted with cheap green screen effects and dull CGI. And it certainly doesn't help that the cast along the extras are populated with Caucasian actors, leaving an absence of any Egyptian actors. I mean a movie that takes place in Egypt and features no actual Egyptians? Come on now! And sadly, that's not the worst part. The worst past comes from the horrendous performances the cast displays. Brendon Thwaites plays the main character and throughout the entirety, never seems to bring his A-game here, either does Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as the supporting character. The biggest actor on screen is easily Gerard Butler who plays the villain, and even his role falls short of appeal. Those expecting him bringing the powerful energy he brought as Leonidas in '300' are in for a major disappointment. The only thing we get out of the acting instead, is insanely laughable dialogue that incite more laughs than anything worth taking seriously, even during the scenes that supposed to dramatic.When going into a epic fantasy adventure, one can easily expect to experience some flashy special effects, solid characters, and a decent, if not groundbreaking plot to keep the film moving. None of these is found here. The plot to begin with, is vastly incoherent and in the end, makes no sense. When the film is not feeding us tense action scenes, it tries it's best to develop the plot through the characters arguing constantly, when it's really just trying to fill in a two-hour runtime. Yes, Set, the main villain is trying to take over the Egyptian empire but before the first hour, we are given almost no reason to care. In brief summary, it's just boring.The action sequences along with the battle scenes are supposed to fun. In contrary, these scenes are painful to watch. It's bad enough there is lazy acting and ridiculous spiraling camera work associated with these scenes, but the special effects are plain awful to the point looking like effects seen in a B-movie. The visual effects aren't too solid either, especially with the bloated use of CGI. The computer-generated creatures may not look too inept, but they're pretty unimpressive, especially considering this generation's technology that's capable of making superior animation in video games than this. It's hard to believe how a $140 million dollar epic consists of such bad effects. Gods of Egypt is an epic disaster leading up one of worst films of this year so far. This film fails at just about every aspect in terms of writing, narrative, and technicality; and the worst part, it more than likely has made itself a wide target for the Razzie awards. With this film, slacking as both an epic and unintentional parody, If you hadn't seen this movie, don't worry you're not missing anything.",Gods of Egypt

59,IonicBreezeMachine,Beautiful but hollow.,4,15 August 2020,"Much like how Clash of the Titans (2010) and Immortals mined Greek mythology to respectable commercial success, Gods of Egypt is an attempt to mine what ""blockbuster potential"" there is to be had from Egyptian mythology. Based in a world where Gods are 12 Feet tall, live among humans, and bleed gold, the film follows Mortal thief Bek and exiled God Prince Horus in their journey to take down usurper Set for differing reasons. The movie does look nice as there's tons of detail with fantastical structures and vivid colors, but then the novelty wears off when everything else fails to engage. Bek and Horus aren't compelling protagonists and the only fun to be had comes from Gerard Butler as Set giving a reasonably entertaining hammy villain performance. The spectacle is beautiful, but if there's nothing engaging you it has about the same entertainment value as a theme park ride, except theme park rides at least have the decency not to be two hours long. If you need your ancient Egyptian trash blockbuster fix, stick with Brendan Fraser's first two Mummy movies or Roland Emmerich's Stargate.",Gods of Egypt

61,RforFilm,What in Ra's name was Gods of Egypt supposed to be? It's so bad that it's kind of enjoyable,2,2 March 2016,"Three years ago, I was at the California Science center in Los Angeles where I got to see an exhibit on Ancient Egypt based on the pharaoh Cleopatra. The experience featured several artifacts from the era that have been collected below the Mediterranean Sea and showcased a time full of gods and a collective tribute to the afterlife. This was one of my favorite museum pieces and reminded me that I used to really enjoy the history of ancient Egypt back when I was a kid. I think it was the fact that the Egyptian world was both beautiful with its pyramids and gold and disgusting with its obsession with death. Ancient Egypt has been present in a lot of biblical based features like The Ten Commandments and The Prince of Egypt. The fascination of the country grew upon even more with the discovery of King Tut and the curses supposedly set upon those that opened the tomb. Presenting it in film is nothing new, but I can honestly say I have not seen anything about the Egyptian gods like Ra and such. Gods of Egypt does this and is a throwback to classic sword and sorcery movies like Jason and the Argonauts. Though the setting is ancient Egypt, the story is set in an alternate world where the Earth is flat and the gods rule over the mortals. In fact, King Osiris is about to hand the throne over to his son Horus (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), but a surprise visit from Set (played by Gerald Butler), one of the sons of Ra, changes everything. Set kills Osiris, takes Horus' eyes, and takes the throne. A year passes under the new rule where mortal Bek (played by Brenton Thwaites) is a common thief who is looking for his love, Zaya.Zeya gets killed and Bek decides that exiled god Horus is the only one who can bring her back. He takes her to him, but Horus says that he needs his eyes back in order to bring back the dead (and to be able to change into a god-like animal). They strike a deal to get the eyes in exchange for saving Zaya's soul in the afterlife. The briefly receive help from Ra (played by Geoffrey Rush) in his floating vessel above the Earth before returning to finish the quest. They are racing against the clock as Set is obtaining godly items in order to increase his power. Gods of Egypt is so fascinating! Not that it's a good movie (not at all!), but this is an example on how one can take an intriguing idea for an adventure and do almost everything wrong with it. The script is wrong, the castings wrong, the effects are wrong, and the overall direction is all over the place. The movie has gained controversy for having no Egyptian actors and it's weird how not only are there no Arabic people of any kind, but the majority is white (its even more embarrassing with Gerald Butler doing his thick Scottish accent in an Egyptian world).I have no idea how lazy the director was, but you'd think he would have taken another look at the computer effects and realize that maybe their not done yet. It's obvious that the majority of the film was made in front of a green screen. The lighting never convinced me once that they were outdoors. While some of the background shots look cool, most of the monsters and magical elements seem more like out of a video game then a Hollywood movie (I had this problem with Maleficent). These people need to learn from Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars: The Force Awakens with how proper effects are pulled off. I'll give this two Egyptian Ra's out of ten. I cannot recommend this as a genuine good movie, but I can recommend it for something else. Like how Battlefield Earth and The Room were made, Gods of Egypt is so bad that within its demented sense, it's actually kind of enjoyable. I could easily see this as an easy target for comedians to point out all the problems. So if your looking for something to laugh at and not with, wait for this to come out on DVD and put yourself in an strange Egyptian mind frame.",Gods of Egypt
62,dave-mcclain,Pray to the Gods of Egypt that no one drags you to this movie.,3,7 March 2016,"He was said to be born of a virgin and his birth came to be celebrated on or about December 25th. As a baby, he was depicted in a stable scene, lying in a manger, with the image of his mother beside him. He was considered the light of the world, an avenger against the power of darkness and, as such, the savior of mankind. According to many historical sources, including the writings of former Catholic priest Joseph McCabe, this was the mythology surrounding the ancient Egyptian god Horus in the centuries before the birth of Jesus. Horus is the central character in the CGI-heavy fantasy film ""Gods of Egypt"" (PG-13, 2:07).The film, however, focuses more on Horus' deeds as a god than how he was worshipped. The plot is very loosely based on ancient Egyptian mythology, particularly the story ""The Contendings of Horus and Set"", and takes place at a time in Egyptian pre-history when it was believed that gods lived among humans. These gods aren't omniscient, omnipotent, or immortal, but they can live over 1,000 years, they bleed gold, they can be resurrected if killed, they have special powers (like turning into the birds and animals that symbolize them in ancient mythology) and they're about three feet taller than most adult humans. Naturally, the humans serve these earth-inhabiting gods. In return, they protect Egypt and its people.As the movie opens, the god Osiris (Bryan Brown) is about to crown his son, Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) God-King of Egypt. The other gods have turned out for the ceremony, along with all the puny mortals, including an arrogant and self-righteous young man called Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and his girlfriend, Zaya (Courtney Eaton), who is sporting the dress that Bek stole for her to wear at the coronation. But, alas, this coronation was not to be. Seconds before Horus was to receive the crown, Osiris' brother Set (Gerard Butler) shows up to totally spoil the party. Tired of ruling the isolated desert regions of Egypt and unhappy with being passed over for the throne of all Egypt, he stabs Osiris, gouges out the ""all seeing"" eyes of Horus and claims the throne for himself. He then presents the crowd this choice: worship him or be enslaved. What a jerk! The noble and selfless warrior from ""300"", Set is not.Life in Egypt really goes downhill for both humans and gods with Set in charge. He kills other gods who get in his way and he forces the people to work on his massive construction projects. Zaya ends up working for the mean and nasty Urshu (Rufus Sewell), Set's chief architect. Zaya, who still believes in the power and basic goodness of the other gods, convinces Bek to go find Horus and convince him to come out of hiding and help Egypt. But it's not that simple. First, there's that whole blindness thing. Bek breaks into Set's vault, survives enough booby traps to impress Indiana Jones and is able to make off with one of Horus' eyes. Secondly, Bek has to convince an exiled and bitter god to help the insignificant little humans. Bek accomplishes that as well, but with only one of his eyes, Horus' powers are limited.Horus and Bek are going to need a lot of help. Horus prays to his grandfather, the sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush), who transports Horus and Bek up to his space-based solar barge from which he battles the powers of darkness. Ra chooses to stay neutral in the power struggle between his son and nephew and does very little to aid Horus. Back on earth, with only Bek at his side, Horus has to try enlisting the help of Horus' former lover and now Set's wife, Hathor (Elodie Yung), Thoth (Chadwick Boseman), who is the God of Wisdom, not to mention Anubis, the lord of the underworld. Even with the help that he's able to gather, defeating Set looks to be nearly impossible. Now, I won't tell you how the movie ends, except to say that the last scene sets up a possible sequel – but not likely, considering how poorly this movie did.""Gods of Egypt"" isn't the grand fantasy epic that it clearly wants to be. The quality of the CGI is mostly pretty impressive, but some of the visuals (like Ra's aircraft carrier-looking space barge) border on the laughable. More importantly, overblown special effects are a poor substitute for a good story. The film's plot points are alternately confusing, non-sensical and silly, as is much of the script's dialog. Take the character of Bek for example. While the gods helping the people and people standing up to the gods is indeed part of ancient mythology, the attempt to put modern phrases into Bek's mouth feels out of place and his attitude probably should have gotten him squashed like a bug by any self-respecting deity.It doesn't help that the actor playing Bek lacked the charisma to sell this silliness. He's not alone. Most of the acting was of poor quality and the glaring omission of actual Egyptians in the cast made things even worse. This movie is all style and little substance. Pre-teen boys may like it, but if you're outside that relatively narrow demographic, you should probably pray to the gods that you don't have to spend two hours with this highly-fictionalized cinematic interpretation of ancient Egypt's rich mythology.

63,ja_kitty_71,An awesome Egyptian fantasy,10,8 June 2016,"I thought this is an awesome fantasy film of the year. In fact it's the only film of 2016 I had reviewed so far. Also another reason why I love this mythological references in it as a connoisseur on folklore and myth.Set in a time in ancient Egypt where the gods live among the humans, vengeful Set killed his brother King Osiris, usurp the throne from his nephew Prince Horus on his coronation and plucked his mystical eyes as well. With that, all of Egypt is enslaved and conquered. Two youngsters Bek and his sweetheart Zaya had managed to steal back one of Horus' eyes. But during their escape, Zaya was shot by an arrow and died. At the tomb where Horus had hid all those years (or months), Bek strikes a bargain with the despondent god: Resurrect Zaya in exchange for the other eye and help to stop Set. That's all I am telling. You folks will have see it for yourself.Overall, this is an awesome movie. It is very well written and is really cool! The story was perfect, full of suspense and really worth the PG-13 rating.

64,DukeEman,One for the Gamers and lovers of spectacular action scenes.,6,24 February 2016,"For some strange reason I was wishing for a big budget over the top version of Land of the Pharaohs (1955), with a bit of Cleopatra (1963) and Jason and the Argonauts (1963) thrown in. And true to form, it came pretty close to the campiness of those films! Apart from the storyline, this spectacular action adventure sure delivers in the CGI department and creative sound design. It's one for the big screen and thumping speakers, insulting your senses in a most pleasurable masochist way.Director Alex Proyas mostly delves in dark films where ""The End Is Nigh"". These dark themes were noticeable in Spirits of the Air, Gremlins of the Clouds (1989), The Crow (1994) and Dark City (1998). They even had it's moments in the Hollywood blockbusters I, Robot (2004) along with The Knowing (2009). With Gods of Egypt, it almost felt like it wasn't an Alex Proyas film. Maybe a bit too spectacular for his style, but he managed to fit moments in where he got to play with his dark-side, mostly evident in the ""Afterlife"" scenes. In this film, Alex got to create his vision with perfection, thanks to today's technology. Hopefully he'll be able to use that on his next project, maybe something a little darker, a bit more Proyas than Hollywood.What saved this film from its own corniness is the talent it attracted. Gerard Butler is perfect as Gerard Butler the brute! Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau gets to play around with his Game Of Thrones character, Jamie, by adding a little more manliness to it. The surprise of the lot was the mortal, Bek, played by the Aussie cutie, Brenton Thwaites. He supplied the wit and charm desperately needed in this. Even the Aussie icons, Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush came along for the ride. What they both managed to do was play it perfectly straight, in a theatrical way, that suited the style of this film. You noticed the tone of the film changed when Rush was on screen with Butler or Nikolaj. The level went up a notch, and it was momentarily intriguing. (And see if you can spot another Aussie icon, Bruce Spence:)The true winner of this epic film is the ""Gamer"". This film has all the elements a Gamer would love. It has dangerous mazes our heroes have to get through, and thrilling combating scenes captured by frantic maneuvering cameras. If the film does well at the box office I'm sure there will be a game following hot on its heels.I must admit I was surprised how entertaining this film was. Maybe because I saw it on the big screen and was distracted by the incredible CGI and sound design. The story was pleasing enough, it has the Game Of Thrones element where characters you least expected to perish did. There was the Lord Of The Rings journey and a bit of everything else you might have seen if you love your big action adventure films. And not to forget the romantic element which played heavily in our heroe's destination. I think the studio executives got ever audience angle covered.",Gods of Egypt
65,swilliky,Gods of Egypt is miscast but has some OK special effects,5,8 March 2016,"This movie seemed poorly planned from the beginning and I couldn't convince anyone that this movie would be worthwhile to see and even I was reluctant to purchase a ticket, hence my review coming so late. The first issues that popped up once the preview debuted was the lack of diverse characters in a setting like Egypt. The casting was a foolish choice for the film and really didn't add anything, actually adding the setting as Egypt simply didn't make sense since this was an otherworldly place that would have suited the plot much better to be set off world. Still the casting needs to change on all these movies.Overall the acting wasn't so terrible but what is expected from the stock cast. Gerard Butler continues to copy his success in 300 with much less fanfare this time turning it into a villain role. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau reprises the role he plays in Game of Thrones as a rich playboy, or rather a God in this instance. From his first appearance, it is clear that the awkward sizing of the Gods to mortals was a special effect that they just couldn't seem to pull off.

66,CANpatbuck3664,"Put Aside the Racism Claims, This Movie is Still Really Bad",3,13 June 2016,"The amount of controversy surrounding Gods of Egypt overshadowed the release of the movie to the point where no one seemed to care if the movie was any good or not. The buzz around the movie was centred on the ""white-washing"" of the cast. This essentially means that for a movie set in Egypt, the biggest parts were all given to white actors as opposed to promoting a more diverse cast. After having watched the movie, those claims are probably true but I honestly want to set aside that issue and judge it separately. The title of this review sums up largely what I have to say, racism aside, this is still a lacklustre movie.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We largely follow 2 characters throughout Gods of Egypt, I'll start by introducing the mortal one. Bek (Brenton Thwaites) is living in the city with his girlfriend Zaya (Courtney Eaton). He promised her a lavish life but they struggle to make ends meet. She works as a servant for a famous Egyptian builder Urshu (Rufus Sewell) while Bek is a petty thief. They may be poor but they seem happy enough, especially Zaya who is happy to go witness the crowning of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau).Horus is the other main character. When the movie begins we get an introduction through narration how the god Ra (Geoffrey Rush) has two sons Osiris and Set (Gerard Butler). Osiris was given the city as his kingdom while Set had to ""settle"" for the desert. Osiris has decided to pass down his his crown to Horus who despite being more laid-back has been deemed ready for the honour. We see him getting ready and he's joined by the goddess Hathor (Elodie Yung). They are together and Horus even hints at them getting married in the future. The ceremony begins and it's going well. Osiris gives a speech about how he loves his people and that they should all be entitled to the afterlife. Set arrives and embraces his brother but then his army marches on the stage and he stabs his brother. Horus tries to avenge his father but he's defeated by Set. Set rips out Horus' eyes and declares himself king. Horus has to flee the city leaving the people to suffer under the rule of the tyrannical Set.I think the biggest surprise I had with this movie is seeing how big the budget was and how bad the CGI looked. To be clear, there's nothing wrong with being reliant on green screen and computer generated effects. I'm not criticizing it on that basis, it's just they spent so much money and it still didn't look up to par. I was kind of in disbelief about it, there were times when it looked okay but considering the budget ($140 million) it should have been a lot better.Sometimes when the material isn't the best, the actors and actresses can find away to elevate it, this wasn't one of those cases. The material largely dragged the cast down. I wouldn't say anyone looked bored or uninterested, it seemed like everyone was trying, it's just the material was so corny, they couldn't salvage it. This movie took good actors like Chadwick Boseman, Geoffrey Rush and even Gerard Butler and just made them look awful. How they decided to deal with the actors' accents I didn't understand at all. Why is Gerard Butler still speaking with a Scottish accent? I don't like to single people out for criticism but I thought Brenton Thwaites was really flat. His character isn't interesting so he has to overcome that baggage but instead of shining besides that, he didn't help things at all.The other disappointment is the material itself. Something cool could have been done with this story. Most of the small things I liked in this movie were things like the character designs, the setup of the environments, how the gods would transform and fight each other and how they mixed in the lore surrounding the gods in Egypt and worked it in to the story. But instead of capitalizing on that, the dialogue was pretty terrible (the jokes are groan worthy) and parts of the story didn't make sense (When Osiris is murdered, the rest of the gods are present, why not just team up and attack? Also why is it when Horus is at full strength earlier does he lose to Set and then when he's still recovering and Set has gathered the skills from some of the other gods does he win?). It just didn't come together and I think if they had spent a little more time ironing out the kinks, they might have had a better finished product.I was warned ahead of time that this movie was bad. A friend of mine had seen it and warned me it wasn't worth it. I decided to see it anyway and I wish I hadn't. I've seen worse but this movie was a mess. I'm glad it's found an audience as the Blu-Ray sales have been big but I won't be picking up a copy. If you read about the behind-the-scenes when it comes to Gods of Egypt, you understand why it was so polarizing and why it ended up a mess. I would like to point out what I said in the summary one more time, I'm not against this movie because it may or may not be racist, I'm against it because it sucks.",Gods of Egypt

I appreciate the effort of spending 140 million on a fantasy film as I love fantasy but here it is money wasted. The dialogue isn't great, the battles aren't great, the scenery feels fake. It's a so-so blockbuster essentially. Greek mythology can be a little silly but they took it to the extreme here and it doesn't have to be.

Even so, there needs to be a clear presentation of story, scenes that move the story forward, faithfulness to the myths of old, a relatable premise, and identifiable characters, this film accomplishes all those things. It's not oscar material, but it successfully comes together in a way that tells a complete story, with timeless themes including love, life, death, the afterlife, betrayal, honor, and friendship.

One the story was too convoluted to be desired, and the fact that Geoffrey rush was playing rah himself offered no comfort to his character. All I could see was a pirate from his last movie. Brendan Thwaites was not in my vocabulary a very good actor. His talent lies in watching others, to how they react rather than immersing himself into the character role. It was almost as if he was being cued to speak for his part. Gods of Egypt in my view is not the best filler for any kind of weather or season it just isn't a believable film. Alex too needed to go over most if not all of the films content. The choppy reactionary framing, and some abstract takes made it very confusing in some ways. All in all... just one among many from summit that has to clean out their closets.",Gods of Egypt
71,socrates99,This is so wildly imaginative that it is sometimes hard to understand,8,25 November 2016,"I saw this for the second time after Thanksgiving and it was just right for the holiday. A fun movie that's best seen more than once, I suspect, as we don't know these characters in the West and it's a little hard keeping them straight the first time. (My wife had no trouble.) This is an ambitious, very dense and fast moving fantasy. Some of the women are a little mind-boggling, but they don't seem to know it. The CGI is often annoying but if you just think about the idea they're expressing and forget the shortcomings of its manifestation, it's easy to let it have its say.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Horus is in the central role. He's next to be crowned the King of Egypt, but he's a bit of a wastrel and loses the crown even before he's crowned. He's loved by Hathor, played by the bewitching Elodie Yung. They're two of the many gods inhabiting Egypt along with its many mortals. They're taller than the mortals and can turn into powerful beasts at will. The story revolves around Set, played by Gerard Butler, who wants to rule Egypt, Horus and a human, Bek, played by Brenton Thwaites who shows these gods that we humans can be clever and brave too.I particularly liked how it's so divorced from the Judeo-Christian mythology, that it's refreshing and a relief. It's no masterpiece, but it's hardly the dud IMDb seems to think it is.",Gods of Egypt
72,p-jonsson,Don't believe the haters of this movie!,9,23 July 2018,"When the credits rolled after having watched this movie with my kids I was perplexed. I knew this movie had not received very great ratings and I had heard rumors that some people had even labelled it the worst movie of the year. However, I had liked watching the movie...a lot!Sure, the script is predictable and certainly wont win any prices for best script anywhere. The acting is adequate but no more. But it is a fun fantasy adventure movie, a simple adventure / action fantasy roller-coaster. Plenty of fairly cool special effects. Some humor, some romance. It is also fairly devoid of politically correct preaching, whining, mentally unstable and self destructive ""heroes"" and all that crap. In short it is the kind of movie I like.I actually looked up the movies page on Wikipedia and it was pretty much full of nonsense and whining about how the movie was not ""ethnically correct"". What the f...? It is a bloody fantasy adventure movie for Christ sake! It is meant to entertain! Who the hell cares about whether the actors are native Egyptians or something else? Well, I guess Eskimos would look a bit funny in those roles but otherwise...Yes it does take quite a few liberties with Egyptian mythology but again, it is a fantasy movie guys! And Egyptian mythology, like any other mythology, goods etc, is nothing but fantasy and story telling from the start so just live with it. To me they stayed true enough to the core of the mythology and I would actually give the director and script writers bonus points for actually depicting the earth as flat as was the predominant belief in those times. Those scenes with Ra dragging the sun and the flat Earth was quite beautiful actually.The rating on IMDb is also on the low side but of those that took the effort to write a review most seems to be quite positive. The mostly negative ones are, of course, the so called ""critics"". No surprise there.It is sad to see how a, in my opinion a quite entertaining, movie can be so sabotaged by a bunch of, again in my opinion, loud mouthed, ignorant, intolerant, fanatical SJWs who seems to believe that a movie cannot be allowed to just entertain but has to carry a political message, their political message.I would recommend anyone into fantasy and adventure movies to check this one out if you should stumble upon it. I certainly do not regret adding it to my collection.",Gods of Egypt
73,Magow-Intermean,Gods Of Egypt Review,6,13 April 2019,"In ancient Egypt, where deities living among mortals, the exiled god Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) attempts to reclaim his throne and his people from the wicked Set, and only a mortal peasant can help him.
In the past, Alex Proyas has created seductive gothic worlds, notably in The Crow and Dark City. He stumbles into the garish sun for this catastrophe, shining unkind light on a story both misconceived and badly executed. It is hard to sweep away everything that's terrible to see any tiny kernel of what may have at some point seemed like a good idea.
This is the Dolly Parton of movies, without any of the wit.
In a fantasy Egypt where gods rule and most Egyptians are white with English accents, evil god Set (Gerard Butler, separating himself from the crowd by being Scottish) kills his brother Osiris, blinds Osiris' son Horus (Coster-Waldau) and steals his throne. With the help of a peasant thief (Brenton Thwaites), Horus attempts to reclaim the crown and set his people free. Thwaites is saddled with a sodden lump of a role, trying to give charming cockiness to a character written as simply arrogant. Every time he evades death is a disappointment.
It's a film that reeks of money, big swooping shots stretching on for digitally created miles and golden costumes glinting, but it's money badly spent. All the effects look like they missed a final pass, shiny with that glossy mid-'90s artificiality. It brings to mind the Dolly Parton line, ""It costs me a lot of money to look this cheap"". This is the Dolly Parton of movies, without any of the knowing wit.
The plot is lurid and camp, which could have been quite fun if Proyas had embraced it, but he tries to give it a weight it can't support, forcing needlessly dense mythology that confuses convolution with depth. With all the toys at his disposal here Proyas might have been expected to at least throw in some exciting action, but there's an afterthought, samey quality to the set pieces, the majority finding our heroes jumping off a ledge and hoping for the best. It's not even spirited enough to be enjoyably awful.
Summer 2016 has had a high number of shonky blockbusters, but Gods Of Egypt is the worst of them.",Gods of Egypt
74,coreyjdenford,Praying for mercy,2,17 June 2016,"This is my review of Gods of Egypt (spoiler free) * (1/5) Cast: Brenton Thwaites, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Gerard Butler, Courtney Easton, Geoffrey Rush.Plot: Mortal hero Bek (Thwaites) teams with the god Horus (Coaster-Waldau) in an alliance against Set (Butler), the merciless god of darkness, who has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict.I just want to start off by saying this film is abysmal in fact it is worse than abysmal. As far as summer blockbusters go this is by far the worst. Gods of Egypt is one of those rare films were the mortal is the hero. Director Alex Proyas concentrates on making this film action packed and look really pretty rather than focusing on an actual plot. This film is completely packed with CGI and it does look astonishing it's that that the story makes it a worthless experience.This film packs in a lot of action mainly caused by Set (Butler) whose character looks very bad-ass but that is all that is working for him. This movie could have been a lot better if not for the idiotic story kind of like Clash of the Titans. This is probably going to be the biggest flop this year which is a shame because the hype was so high, and made on a budget of $140 million that money just made the movie look pretty and the actors in this were just cannon fodder.Another thing is that this movie contains some of the biggest stars in Hollywood for example Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau whose known for playing Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. Although Gerard Butler hasn't done anything good since 300 (2006) just a matter of an opinion. The one person that has gone down in standards is Australian actress Courtney Eaton previously known from last years action masterpiece Mad Max: Fury Road.Here are some points as to why this is the worst summer blockbuster:Plot: As said before the plot is just non existent see normally films that have the main character as a mortal and he becomes a hero are well paced and a delight, but this is far from that with this your brain will just melt because of the stupidity. Essentially the plot of this movie should say witness my action and my pretty because that's all it's good for, just a poignant mess.Acting: Now the acting is very complex sometimes it's good and sometimes it is not but most of the time it is just, just an added feature. While choosing the casting they just picked who thought would make this movie good they were picked at random, sometimes a good thing but in this case it is to be avoided. Some of the actors in this film are prestigious legends like Geoffrey Rush who is known for The Kings Speech (2010), the Australian actor made that film good and watchable, but for this even with his performance I was begging for it to end.Other than that this film is exceptionally gorgeous but this summer could been without it.Verdict: Very good looking, stupid and quite frankly doesn't even feel like it should even fall into the so bad it's good. It is eternally bad and should be forgotten.2/10 dreadful and an absolute mess.",Gods of Egypt
75,dvc5159,Gods Gone Wild,5,24 February 2016,"Alex Proyas' ""Gods of Egypt"" is a film that is boldly and unabashedly silly and preposterous. Few other words can describe it. It has the pratfalls that beset typical Hollywood fare. It is already the subject of controversy due to its preeminently Caucasian cast. It has both critics and audiences sharpening their knives, a film supposedly destined for failure.Oh, but it works because the film truly bonkers. Truly insane. Truly out of its mind.Proyas, a gifted and visionary filmmaker, is renowned for having thought-provoking and striking imagery in all of his films, and this film is without exception. Where in any other film do you get to see goddesses horse-riding giant fire-breathing serpents? Or wagons carrying infinite amounts of gold dumping their load in a funnel-like tube ala dump trucks? Or for that matter, gods bleeding gold? Or Gerard butler riding gold- chromed giant beetles into battle? Or gods that have body parts that, when disfigured, instantly become detachable jewelry? Or...Admittedlly the plot is indeed silly even by blockbuster Hollywood standards, however a lesser Proyas film is still more visually inventive than the usual Hollywood movie factory output, and that is always a plus. Whereas a film like ""Pan"" bludgeons us over the head with its disgusting cynicism and disrespect for the source material by portraying its titular hero as a clichéd messiah figure, Proyas directs with the exuberance of a kid in Disneyland - with Disneyland replaced with an Egyptian museum exhibit – eager at the chance to create his own action packed tale while still respecting the gods as, well, gods.What is there to say about the plot, except that it has gods and it has Egypt? You get exactly what's on the tin. You get a chiseled hero in the form of Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), his athletic and quippy comic sidekick (Brenton Thwaites) and beautiful love (Courtney Eaton), who set out to defeat Horus' evil uncle Set (Gerard Butler, simultaneously parodying his ""300"" persona while being supremely sinister).The whole thing sounds very Greek. But rather than eschewing the silly tone and making it ""Gladiator""-style dark and dreary ala the recent ""Clash of the Titans"" movies, Proyas and the actors let loose and have a ball with the material, never being too self aware while being silly enough to make for compelling viewing. Even rising star Chadwick Boseman (terrific in both ""42"" and ""Get on Up""), as Thoth the god of knowledge, relishes in chewing the scenery with every moment, never afraid of being campy. Not bad.Look, it's clear that the film is a B-grade Saturday night matinée film straight from the 1950s. Ever heard your grandparents told you about those? The ones where there's usually a double feature showcasing silly low budget sci-fi/horror/fantasy plots with handsome men and gorgeous gals, supremely cheesy one liners and having no purpose other than to put a goofy smile on your face from start to finish, almost guaranteeing a good time out? Well, this is one such movie, but with a blockbuster budget and the added pleasure of having Proyas wrapping the fun around with his wonderful thought-provoking visuals and production design, and going wild with this thing. Two set pieces involving a gigantic worm-like demon and the Egyptian afterlife are visual marvels, triumphs of set design and visual effects, evoking senses of awe and wonder like films from yesteryear and other gifted visionaries. For mainstream filmmakers, CGI is the cheat sheet. For Proyas, it's his toy box. This is eye candy on a spectacular scale, and audiences won't get short-changed.Bear with me here, but if you were to replace the cast with genuine Egyptian actors, I think the film would be mired in even bigger controversies because it will definitely look more inaccurate and seemingly insulting than it supposedly already is. It's stupid, yes, but it's gloriously stupid and never succumbs to taking itself ever so seriously. Proyas sort of knew what he was doing here, and he didn't give a damn about what others thought. And that's the kind of filmmaker I admire the most.",Gods of Egypt

77,DuskShadow,"A film about African Gods, but where few of the Gods looked African",6,25 June 2016,"May contain some spoilers... but the movie was so so enough , that it wouldn't have kept anything, let alone itself, without spoiling ones evening. So here I am again, remarking upon yet another subject I already had pegged, fore I fooled myself into watching, hoping for the best. Apparently, de-nile really ain't just a river in Egypt, also evident by the ratings and fanfare over this pile when it released.The funniest thing about this film was the correlation between Game of Thrones and the Wrath of The Titans film.There was an impetuous prince whom liked to be a libertine; He got it on when he wanted, even with his sister a lot.(Since they are gods of the same pantheon, their lineage can be traced back to the very same progenitor, in this case, RA is the head Lannister, too busy even to shame his kids for incest. In fact most sounded too colonial for my liking.) The prince is occasionally advised by a smart mouthed, though highly knowledgeable British sounding person (ANOTHER ONE?!). Oh but don't worry because he is more vain than even the bad guy, so its okay...=_=. The prince had lost a part of his body that made him feel sorry for himself and utterly useless to everyone whom still had the ability to see. So he traveled around with a normy to try and pick himself up, whilst being told what an turd he is. Still only one black god in Egypt of note so far, while the princes sister is with the new king . ENTER the WoTTs film stuff: There is an obviously more nefarious than the average gods...god, and he is not pleased being anything but numero uno. Like the titan Prometheus , there is a plot device in the form of an obscenely large space ringworm, that would make H.P. Lovecraft blush. So there is a race to get back some other plot device so as not the make viewers remember themselves by having too much to recall, by making way to a large edifice with many moving parts, just like in WoTTs, that shifts and turns, like a shifty turney thing. Thus the normy just runs up to it and pew, pew pew takes it down in a heartbeat. There's giant animals that hunt the heroes, a few scenes obviously meant to be seen only in 3-D, and nonstop MELODRAMA. When suddenly, DEMONS, from out of nowhere, then POOF! gone with the bloody wind of the desert.Enter my wish for alcohol. Like Set and his thirst for power, I had to imagine I was intoxicated to enjoy this movie ( its hardly a film ). And even when I thought I had found praiseworthy content , a diamond in the roughness of it all, up pops a scene where a blow from Set does not even connect with his foe. WHERE WAS THE CG THEN? After all the rest?!Set storms the gates all by himself, taking his ex wife's palace, though there are what seem like mortal soldiers behind him that are called HOUNDS ( Game of Thrones reference again? Meh, too easy but I had to).A recognizable actor here, still too few black people in ancient Africa there, and all the while ONE SINGLE GOD is taking over from a vast amount of others, fore the Egyptians pantheon was fairly impressive, yet he was unstoppable.The only thing I was shocked not to see was if Set's power came from the desert, which was purported to once be lush, the quenching of the flames from which Set's power derived would have explained the barren wasteland that covers much of Africa today. BUT NEIN! DUKE IT OUT INSTEAD! ACTION ACTION VIOLENCE lol...ffs.HOWEVER! A trap is sprung, and this time its the sad prince god whom is ensnared, but the normy human thief, whom could have probably escaped anyways, because he just can, no formal training in acrobatics needed apparently, just does whatever. If the thief had been the same size as the pathetic gods in the movie, he would have had about the same amount of muscle as Horus's actor from Lame of Thrones. Go back and look at the kids biceps and then look at Prince Lannister's, there's some funny casting there, hiding the lads biceps under leather upper arm straps to make him seem meek. YET ALL THE NONSTOP THIEVERY AND danger DODGING!The film was not a total loss. Ahem: It at least KINDA tries to enlighten the miseries overflowing our world today to be aware of something older than the last piece of cellular nonsense or whose breasts and butt are ample enough to actually be worthy of being called a Love Goddess in the media, as opposed to the thin woman playing the veritable Venus in this movies plot. IF you have nothing better to do, watch it while multitasking or imbibing, though truly would have been grand if I had slammed a can, or two or more of something mind bending before the all too obvious ending, ending that was pretending, pretending to be so much much more. Quoth the flying golden Lannister: "" NEVERMORE"". So shall more stringently I screen such errors, of Hollywood bingingly, making me cringingly suffer to stories based on myths of days of yore. I shall be surprised never...more. R.I.P. Ancient Egyptian Culture.",Gods of Egypt

Thing is, how are blacks, browns, Asians, etc, suppose to get a ""name"" themselves if they aren't given the opportunity in the first place? I definitely can see the outrage over this movie's casting.The movie itself, you can't take seriously. It's campy action adventure fantasy. Think The Mummy movies and The Scorpion King. It's that kind of story, with similar type lines, dialogue, action-adventure scenarios, and comedy. It was actually fun and entertaining in that same type of way. Gerard Butler hammed it up. Bek(Brenton Thwaites) and Horus(Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) had great camaraderie.

It's a story of Gods fighting Gods, the role of mortals in the grand scheme of the Lands of Egypt and ultimately a love story. The screenplay is gargantuan in its delivery, the soundtrack is almost overwhelming, This is the tale of a family of Gods, Set (Gerard Butler) kills his brother and steals the eyes of Horus forcing him to live in the desert sightless and without power. Set plans to become King and rule the lands with misplaced power and fear. However we are introduced to Bek, a mortal who does not take no for an answer and will go to the ends of this world and into the next to save the girl he loves. In the days before CGI this film would still be awesome, right up there with Ben Hur, Spartacus and all those other biblical epics told over the years with a cast of thousands and stars aplenty. However we can now go further, bigger, badder, louder, and much more grand and the cast of thousands is created with a screen and a mouse. It does not lessen the impact of this film in any way and I enjoyed the delivery from start to finish. It gives the viewer a glimpse into the opulence of ancient Egypt and the costume designer must have been given a complete free rein with absolutely stunning results.

84,shobanchittuprolu,Gods of Egypt is a typical fantasy based on Egyptian mythology with good VFX but poor writing and clichéd dialogues,6,23 October 2016,"Gods of Egypt (2016): Once in a while,Hollywood always have a movie on Egyptian mythology which fail miserably(most of the times). Gods of Egypt is such a movie which repeated the same fate this year too.With huge casting and budget,Gods of Egypt has lot of features which has disaster all over it.Plot: In the ancient Egypt, the god Ra (Geoffrey Rush) has split Egypt in two: the fertile part with the Nile would be ruled by his son Osiris ( Bryan Brown) and the desert by his son Set (Gerald Butler) . During the coronation of Horus ( Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) by his father Osiris, Set betrays his brother and kills him. Then he withdraws the eyes of Horus that are his source of power and exiles him in the desert. The mortal thief Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and his beloved wife Zaya(Courtney Eaton) that worships Horus become slaves of Set. Zaya, who is working for Set's architect Urshu (Rufus Sewell), convinces Bek to steal the eyes of Horus from a well-protected pyramid designed by Urshu to give them back to Horus, the only one capable to defeat Set. Bek succeeds but retrieves only one of the eyes; however Urshu discovers the theft and Bek and Zaya need to flee. Urshu kills Zaya with an arrow and when Bek reaches Horus' shelter, he proposes to help the god to retrieve his other eye. In return, he demands that Horus bring his beloved Zaya back from the underworld. They team up and soon Horus' lover Hathor (Élodie Yung) , the goddess of love, leaves Set and joins them in their quest to defeat the evil Set. Did Bek help Horus in defeating Set and did he get Zaya back???Plus Points:1)VFX: God of Egypt has good visual effects.Even though there are less 3D effects,others are eye feast.Egypt locations and sets are well made.2)Performances: Everyone gave decent performances.Brenton as Bek,Nikolaj as Horus and Courtney as Zaya gave good performances.Gerald Butler as Villain is weird but good.Minus Points:1)Story: Gods of Egypt has typical plot where fight against evil brother by an abandoned family member:( Used since ages2)Duration: This movie has duration of 2hr 08min which may not seem long but felt so long.3)Dialogues: They are so clichéd that I got confused to watch it as either an adventure or a comedy...So,Gods of Egypt is a typical fantasy based on Egyptian mythology with good VFX but poor writing and clichéd dialoguesMy rating 5.5/10",Gods of Egypt

86,Quebec_Dragon,Entertaining and spectacular despite the whitewash casting,7,24 February 2016,"Let's get this out of the way first: most Egyptian gods and the main character should not have been played by Caucasian (white) actors. I tried my very best to get beyond that, but it was jarring throughout and hurt suspension of disbelief. Most of the actors were fine though, especially Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister from Game of Thrones) playing Horus with sincerity and gravitas, but they simply didn't fit the place and the mythology (especially Osiris and Ra). Gerard Butler (Leonidas from 300) was playing the kind of role he's a natural for, warrior-leader in ancient times, but evil this time. As for the main hero couple - Bek, a blond human thief, and Zaya of the ample cleavage - I'd just say they were mediocre and could have been easily played by many other young actors. I did particularly like the role of the ambiguous goddess Hathor who, as a bonus, also looked more Egyptian than the rest of her pantheon.So enough with the casting controversy. Story-wise, it made the mistake of having an older main character narrate, which basically removed any suspense regarding his fate. In an ancient time before history, the Egyptian gods live among humans and rule. The benevolent king Osiris is about to hand over reign of the kingdom to his son Horus. Set, another god, arrives at the coronation, bad stuff happens, and everything is thrown into disarray. Bek, the previously mentioned thief, tries to steal something important (neat traps), loses something precious to him that he wants to regain, and eventually journeys with an exiled god or two. Unfortunately, plot-wise, I felt as if focus groups or someone somewhere ruined parts that could have been more memorable, especially the ending.The gods were shown a bit bigger and taller than mortals, and could transform into humanoid animals. It might seem a silly thing, but I liked the size differences, which made them instantly recognizable and more impressive. As for the creature forms, those of Horus and Set looked CGI, but I liked their design anyway. As for the other creatures, be they giant snakes or Anubis, they looked and moved great (with the exception of the scorpions). This movie reminded me of a throwback to the big and good adventure/fantasy movies of the 80s and 90s. It wasn't too complicated, it kept you entertained and looking forward to the next incident or encounter. Weirdly, even though ""Gods of Egypt"" sometimes had the nostalgic appeal of a film made in another decade (with modern special effects though) and went through familiar tropes, it also sometimes felt fresh (like the sand magic or the afterlife). It had a few clever touches (like the assistants of the god of wisdom) but also a few dumb elements (""good"" idea to leave your companion alone with a bad guy on a platform elevator going up while you decide to climb the side of the pyramid instead).Most locations looked very good (for example the ""ship"" in the sky) and were quite varied. Visually, I found it marvellous, and I didn't mind or notice too much the computer roots . I loved the costumes and armors, certainly not historically-accurate, and the gods looked more than mortal without going over the top (despite the terrible casting). With a couple of exceptions (the chariot escape), I found the action scenes above average, even exciting. The fights were well choreographed, but I liked more when the fights involved the human actors somewhat, instead of just the metallic creature forms that kinda took you out of the setting.In that kind of movie, I want to vicariously travel to a different land, experience some wonder, and forget the real modern world for a little while. I also want to meet interesting, unconventional characters and be kept involved in the adventures even if they're not the most original. It especially needs some heart and sincerity to make the proceedings relatable, even if it's awkwardly done. For me, Gods of Egypt mostly succeeded in doing those things making it a decent entry in the maligned fantasy-adventure genre. It shouldn't be judged as a pure comedy, drama, action or romance film. I quite expect this movie to be savaged by the critics for casting (mostly), camp, lack of originality, CGI and what have you, but you know what? Overall, I had fun watching it and I would watch it again at home some time in the future. Not a lot of competition, but one of the better recent mythology-inspired films.Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",Gods of Egypt
87,dk77dk,Gods of Egypt (3D),7,10 February 2021,"A fun movie that doesn't try to be anything more than that.
The cast is good, the characters are fun and the directing is decent.
Gerard Butler is hilarious as Set but the other characters are
fun too, especially Geoffrey Rush as Ra.
An entertaining film work that does not take itself seriously and
thus gives us an escape from reality, and that is the
primary purpose of the film.
The effects are good, and it's especially fun to see Ra fighting Apophis.
The 3D effects are also not bad and make the movie more fun to watch.
In short, decent entertainment with good visuals and interesting
and fun characters.",Gods of Egypt

90,digdog-785-717538,Everything wrong with Hollywood in one film,4,24 May 2016,"OK, lets not mice words - Gods Of Egypt is garbage. It's cringe after cringe of the worst sins a film can commit, to the point where one wonders if they have tried on purpose to make the worst film they could.The Good:The costumes are gorgeous. If these costumes had been used in any other setting, they would really have helped in making a great film.More Leonidas than before. We can't get enough of that one character Gerald Butler played in 300, so we get a second helping here. The Bad:Massive CGI overload. It's not ""bad CGI"", but there is just so much of it, the eye notices more. Also, there's just more detail on screen than there is in the same objects in real life, making it super obvious.Horrible acting; the actors don't even attempt to fit the characters, aside form Butler, they just read their lines, which results in half the cast sounding like they just got out of Jersey Shore, and half trying to ham it up (FORGIVE ME FATHER, I HAVE OVERACTED !!).Despite what the title implies, AND the multiple mentions of Egypt, Gods Of Egypt is not set in Egypt, nor is it set in the past, but rather, this is a completely fictional film set into some parallel world with a limited resemblance of Egypt. The director seems influenced by small screen film, such as music videos; i find it hard to believe it's the same guy who directed the excellent Dark City.The script, worst guilty party in this film, tries to cram as much garbage on the screen as it possibly can .. i haven't seen something this bad since Episode I.The plot isn't as horrible as the rest of the film, but it is however overshadowed by the rest of the garbage piling up on top of it, such as, for example, the dialogue. One scene can have comedy, tragedy, action and violence, sadness, amazement, all crammed into the same 3 minutes.I suppose that, after all, Gods Of Egypt does have a few things going for it, some scenes are visually impressive, mostly due to the sh*tton of money they have thrown at the screen, but i can't count one which isn't spoiled by something, be it greenscreen, some actor chewing the scenery, horrible dialogue, or simply the constant, relentless abuse of CGI.So, Gods Of Egypt is garbage. If you are no older than 15, and you want to see a 2-hour video game cutscene (and also have very low standards for acting), then this film is for you; if you are older, or simply want to watch an actual film, properly made, then i suggest you skip this monstrosity.My vote: 4/10 - revolting.",Gods of Egypt

92,kevinxirau,Not-so high fantasy.,3,6 February 2018,"2016 has been a crazy year for movies for better or for worse. We've had a stunning continuation of both Kung Fu Panda and Star Trek, an onslaught of superhero movies (two of which had the heroes fighting each other), film adaptations of several video games like Warcraft, Disney remakes getting critical praise, and a terrifying return to Japanese cinema by Godzilla. Amongst this plethora of treasured entertainment is one stinking turd under the name ""Gods of Egypt"". Whenever Egypt is brought into American movies or even TV, the focus is usually on just mummies, pyramids, and booby traps and that's about it. This is why I appreciate the filmmakers for doing something different by delving into the actual mythology of this ancient civilization and much of it is quite fascinating. It's just a shame that none of that can make this movie any good. When god of the desert Set (Gerard Butler) murders his brother Osiris and steals the eyes of his nephew, sky god Horus, he begins his ruthless rule of the world with an iron fist, killing anyone who defies him be it man or god. A thief named Bek takes it upon himself to help Horus reclaim his eyes in exchange for resurrecting the woman he loves on an ""epic"" quest to save the world from Set's arrogance and cruel rule. On paper, this seems like a fun adventure, but its execution is lackluster. Very few of the characters are the least bit interesting with the exception of the likes of Ra (Geoffrey Rush), the god of light whose whole character and concept is pretty interesting, and Anubis not only has a cool design but is thankfully NOT portrayed as a villain so much as a guy who is simply doing his job managing the afterlife. I can't give the same credit to the rest of the cast as they are all just flat out boring. Seriously, I care for nobody here, especially Set, whose accent is not only distracting here, but the actor seems like he's got nothing invested in his role and the evil plan is clichéd and full of holes. There's also the issue of ""White-washing"" in an Egyptian setting. I can see why people would be upset by this and I agree with them with the humans, though it's established that the gods can take on any form which is passable at most (still, they could be more ethnically accurate too).Many of the visuals have some cool designs, but it's all generic CGI. Almost nothing is physically present in front of the camera, not even the water the characters waddle in in one scene. THE FREAKIN' WATER! While not inherently bad itself, CGI is already overused these days and I found myself easily bored by the same illusionary trick within the first quarter of the film. The story is a tad needlessly complicated and too damn long. Somewhere in the middle, I was thinking to myself ""Is this mess gonna end anytime soon?"" The music also sucks as I don't remember a single musical note, which really says something. The action is okay with a couple of nice twists, but nothing truly spectacular. Batman and Superman fighting each other for just eight minutes is much more engaging than all the action ""Gods of Egypt"" had to offer. The best way to describe ""Gods of Egypt"" is a waste of time and money. To paraphrase ""The Mummy"": Compared to this, the Ten Plagues were a joy.",Gods of Egypt
93,PetarNeo,Movie disaster,3,30 August 2016,"You would think it is going to be a great movie with that cast and director Proyas but you will be disappointed. All you can see in the movie is young love couple and a couple of Gods that depend on them. Movie focuses on fight between good and bad and that's it. Characters are simply there just to create some effect what is good and what is bad. They are so badly developed and without Gerard and Nikolaj movie would be so lame that it never was supposed to be made. What is to be said about giant two snakes, Sphinx and Apophis, they are just bad very bad. Two snakes created some action but Nikolaj is way too good for them. Was Sphinx supposed to be scary or? Apophis is something that we all wondered about but he just keeps his job as devastator of everything and is stopped within blink of an eye, while two Gods are trying to prove which one needs to be a leader. When you put all that together you get a big blockbuster disaster. 1/4",Gods of Egypt
94,Spideyfan-963-246215,Gods of Egypt (2016) Review,2,27 November 2016,"Gods of Egypt (2016) Starring: Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau, Brenton Thwaites, Chadwick Boseman, Elodie Yung, Geoffrey Rush, Courtney Eaton, Rufus Sewell, Abbey Lee Kershaw, Bryan Brown, Emma Booth, Goran D. Kleut, and Emily Wheaton Directed By: Alex Proyas Review The battle for eternity begins When the film came out earlier this year I knew very little about it, just that it had to do with Gods, mortals and had Gerard Butler. I have been looking into sword and sorcery films as of late and am going to have a marathon for those types of films next once I own all the films I need but while I searching up the sub-genre on facebook I saw that Gods of Egypt was one so I decided to review it now because I'm mostly going to cover the 80s fantasy ones for my marathon. An opening voice-over states that according to a legend, Egypt was the birthplace of civilization. The gods co-existed among the mortals and created the flourishing land for them to share. The son of Ra, Osiris, ruled over the land, while his brother Set was relegated to the desert, to his anger. The time has come for Horus, the son of Osiris, to take his place as king.A mortal young man named Bek (Brenton Thwaites) steals a dress from a vendor in the market to give to his beloved Zaya (Courtney Eaton). They are preparing to go to the coronation event later that day.Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is passed out from a wild event of drinking with the gods the previous night. His beloved woman is Hathor (Elodie Yung), the goddess of love.The time comes for the coronation to take place. Bek and Zaya, along with nearly the whole city, is in attendance. Osiris (Bryan Brown) and his wife Isis (Rachael Blake) bring their son forward and are prepared to pass leadership to him, when Set (Gerard Butler) arrives at the last minute with a gift for Horus, a battle horn. Horus blows into it, summoning Set's army to the front. Turns out Set is staging a coup against his brother and nephew. He demands Osiris to battle him, but he refuses. Set stabs Osiris in the abdomen, leaving him to bleed gold and die. Enraged, Horus transforms into his winged god form, while Set morphs into his dog-like form. They battle in front of everyone, but Set gains the upper hand and is ready to kill Horus until Hathor kneels before him so that Horus may be spared. Set orders all the gods and mortals to kneel before him, and he plucks out both of Horus's all-seeing eyes.A year passes, and all of Egypt is under Set's rule. Those who do not follow him are either left dead or thrown into slavery, like Zaya. Bek frequently visits her in secrecy while her cruel master Urshu (Rufus Sewell) tends to his business with Set, which is building monuments in his honor. Zaya says that only Horus can save them, but he needs his eyes, which are kept in Set's vaults.The plot is interesting and the cast is pretty good but when you get to the CG I mean it is just a mess It is a big giant computer your looking at when the Gods transform I mean you can feel the pixels coming off the screen. The adventure is grand in scale which is great. This looks like a great new sword/sorcery epic but with the lousy effects that's just one huge thing that brings it down. Along with a stupid decision or rather pointless made by Hathor. You'll get it if you some reason plan to see this mess. It didn't click with me because of how much it just looked like one big video game cut scene and I didn't or rather much couldn't get into the characters. Director Alex Proyas has made some pretty decent films in the past, I really enjoy I. Robot with Will Smith and I've good things about Dark City. But with this and Knowing he's become much worse. I'm going to be giving Gods of Egypt a two out of five its just terrible.",Gods of Egypt
95,foxtografo,"Quite uneven in quality, but a fun adventure",6,23 September 2019,"This movie it's a fantasy adventure with a lot of action and a lighthearted story, almost Disney-like.
I mainly loved the scenery designs, they were amazing and some character designs were good too, but I really disliked how the Gods look, at moments the CGI was really bad, and the green screen was too noticeable. Most of the fighting scenes were absolutely abusing rotating cameras, to the point it was annoying.
Also the diealogues were quite cheesy and the story quite predictable and full of cliches.
As a balance of the movie, I've got very beautiful landscapes and designs in general, kind of likeable characters and a lot of action, but it's definitely not to be taken too seriously, besides the fantasy, it's quite silly.",Gods of Egypt

But some are awful, and stupid (the hero kid is a typical nobody who cannot act his way out of a paper bag, and it drags down everything). Every effect shot looks like it's a 10 year old made-for-TV movie. And every shot is an FX shot. Every set seems to be mostly digital.And if that's not enough, they just lost the thread. It's a mess. So oddly edited together, so much focus on the action which are such bad FX they don't really feel perilous or as cool as they could be.Too bad.

Never once do the gods inspire awe or amazement in me, which is very wrong, considering they're ANCIENT GODS OF LEGEND.The other big problem this had was casting. No one really suited their roles very well here, nor did anyone look the part.Overall, a pretty big disappointment. A shame there's still no good retelling of mythology out there.",Gods of Egypt
98,n-kefala,Like a bad video game,4,26 February 2016,"An action-adventure movie inspired by the classic mythology of Egypt, that is enjoyable and fun at times, but not very good in general. The extraordinarily silly effects that look expensive, yet so fake, and the boring and also confusing narrative, make ""Gods of Egypt"" a movie that you will forget very soon. In all this, also add the uninteresting performances and characters. Gerard Butler (who I really like by the way), in this film, is flexing his muscles and growling like he did in ""300"". He is nothing but boring, but he is still the only reason for someone to watch the movie. Alex Proyas ""Gods of Egypt"" feels like a bad video game that I don't want to play again.",Gods of Egypt
99,RogerBorg,An unholy mess in nearly every way,3,11 August 2021,"This feels like a film from an much earlier era, with an infantile script and dialog, some slapstick cringe, and uniformly stilted and wooden performances from the entire cast, some of whom, like Geoffrey Rush, are much better than the material.This must have been deliberate direction, I can only assume in an attempt to introduce a mythic feel, but it's just grinding and irritating. Our spunky young mortal hero is particularly tiresome, and you'll quickly be rooting against him.Most of the cast is strictly White European, but that's fair enough if we can have Africans in Asgard.What's to like here? Well, it rattles along at a decent pace, and isn't over-burdened with long dialog scenes, a particular kindness given the awful script and performances. The scaling of the gods and mortals is kept generally (but not always) consistent. Sets are pretty good, although under-dressed.Against that, much of the CGI and green-screening is awful, comically bad for a film of its era. The score is jarring and becomes increasingly overblown, and the plot is a series of (poor) CGI actions scenes stitched together with the minimum of narrative. In one astonishing gaffe a character jumps onto what seems to be an undisguised modern airbagThe very best thing that I can say about it is that there's plenty of toned and well formed flesh on display, but you can find that on adult video sites, and the scripts and acting are of about the same standard.",Gods of Egypt
100,SpoilerAlertReviews,"Better expected, shinier, more colourful Clash of Titans",6,19 June 2016,"Alex Proyas first feature since Knowing seven years ago, which is a long time for most directors, especially having a relative small catalogue since his first main feature of The Crow back in '94. We see him tackle the conflicting Egyptian mythology of warring God/Kings Set and Horus, whilst mortals suffer the consequences. Game of Thrones Jaime Lannister, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau plays Horus, the 'good' God or the better choice out of the two, who has his new crown and eyes stripped from him by his oppressing Uncle, Set, played by Gerald Butler. Tyranny befalls upon the Egyptian people whilst under new management with Set literally Hellbent on taking over everything, including the underworld, killing all those who stand against him, including his God siblings, acquiring their abilities along the way. Fate would have it, a young, cunning thief by the name of Bek, who doesn't have faith in the Gods unlike his beautiful love Zaya, embarks on freeing her from slavery, which isn't exactly the slavery you might expect, but she's practical a clerk for the Master Builder of the new Egypt. The Giver and Maleficent star Brenton Thwaites plays Bek who reminds me of a live action Aladdin. Sarcastic, slightly arrogant but charming and sly with it. Things go from bad to worse, and slightly complicated leading to Bek inadvertently restore balance to the world and it's all because of a girl. It's always about the girl, right? By seeking the help of the blind God they make a deal and form an unlikely partnership to both get what they want ensuring adventures. So much happens, with plot twists, it is refreshingly unpredictable with a dot to dot storyline. I didn't find it boring however it does feel a lot longer than 126 minutes and towards the end you feel like it's be going for hours. It's CGI heavy with some very imaginative imagery going on. Ra, Geoffrey Rush's stellar sail barge for example and Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman, Thoth are quite impressive to look at however spectacularly so, it loses credibility. Ra's looks like he's constantly night fishing and the dead King from Lord Of The Rings seems to make an appearance, played by Mad Max's Bruce Spence. In fact, there's quite a few heads from Mad Max. Zaya's Countney Eaton being one of Immortal Joe's Virgins. It actually loses its Egyptian flavour along the way and starts to feel more like a fighting fantasy film, even with Marco Beltrami's Aladdin strong score. Quite like the recent Clash of Titans movies only more colourful and shiny. Some of the sets remind me of earlier Star Trek stages, the fight scenes are quite good and there's plenty of bosom to look at but majority of the cast speaking with some form of British accent is actually quite off putting. It has quite a cast and on top of who I have already mentioned, TV Dare Devil's Elodie Yung plays Hathor, goddess of love, superbly well and will definitely keeping an eye out for her (pun intended) regular bad guy Rufus Sewell (A Knight's Tale) plays the Master Builder and Bryan Brown (Cocktail, F/X) briefly plays Osiris. It's actually brainless entertainment with a clichéd but witty script. Going in with low expectations actually resulted in me enjoying this more than expected. It's not amazing, nor ground breaking in any way but entertaining nonetheless. Coaster/ Waldau and Butler play their parts well enough and having watched this, I reckon Nikolaj would make a great Solid Snake.

101,Tehmeh,"Want some good, old-fashioned schlock? Are you 12? You're in luck!",7,6 February 2018,"First things first: this movie is silly, ridiculous and totally immune to any kind of criticism based on history, cultures, religions or ethnic backgrounds. Nothing about this movie even pretends to be serious.Gods of Egypt is a throwback. If you're older, you remember those weird movies Hollywood used to push back in the day when everything was supposedly possible, even in black&white. You'd see amazing things, ambitious and grand settings, horrible special effects and cheesy acting. You were entertained in a way that's hard to describe. It was ridiculous, but yet charming. Gods of Egypt has a lot of those elements.At its heart this is an adventure movie. There is young love, everyman characters among/against the gods, all kinds of fantastical scenery, quick pacing, plenty of back-and-forth dialogue to keep us entertained, tons of action and the ""hero's journey"" (two, in fact). Many characters have real character arcs, and the movie is never boring. It's simple, it's effective and it's quaint. It's what many movies used to be before we - the audience - decided that there is no more room for silly fantastical movies and everything must be dour, dark, believable and serious (not to mention the sensitive political climate). Movies now have rules restraining them, but I'm glad Gods of Egypt has no idea what ""restraint"" means. I'll get the bad things out of the way. This movie is so fast, so full of action, settings and dots to connect that sometimes it feels like many ""important"" plot points or moments are just quickly breezed by, and the impact was often lost. Many of the effects look bad (but I count that as a plus, more about that soon), and some of the fight scenes aren't shot or edited well. Whenever there's fantastical action, you're not even sure what's happening. There are times when this movie becomes a blur. Some of the acting is cheesy, but remember: most of the actors know exactly what kind of a movie they're in.More about the effects and the acting. Often the special effects are bad - and just bad enough that you're enjoying it as a modern version of an old movie where the effects were just as noticeable, only this time it's CGI instead of some elaborate trickery. They're also interesting enough to watch so you don't get bored. It's so fitting, and I can't hold it against the film - on the contrary, the mood was set early on. This is cheese, this is schlock. The actors knew it too, almost every one of them, and it's fun in a surreal way to see a bunch really respected actors in a movie like this. Only Nikolaj Coster-Waldau seemed to be unsure of how to play his character, but his natural charisma (which is ample) is enough. Gerard Butler is clearly having fun, and Elodie Yung along with Chadwick Boseman brings tons of energy to the cast. And if you don't at least smile when you see a very respected actor, Geoffrey Rush, hovering in the air and shooting magic lasers at some huge demonic worm beast while the Kingslayer is flying around in what looks like a weird Iron Man suit with wings, then I don't know what to tell you. Perhaps this isn't your movie.I cannot emphasize the amount of silly action enough. I'm not even sure if I knew what was happening in the last 30 minutes, but I was giggling nonetheless. It was so weird. This is entirely different than getting a sensory overload from a Transformers movie or something like that, so no fear. This movie isn't out to assault your senses, it's just hyperactive and a little clueless in an innocent way.I thoroughly enjoyed Gods of Egypt. It's bad in all the right ways, but it's also sincere and genuinely quaint at times. It even tries to tug at your heartstrings once or twice, and it can't quite get there, but even when it fails at something it still feels more honest than whatever pretentious blockbuster of the week, because there is simply no cynicism in this film. It will never be anything else than a ""fun movie"" but I'm glad I watched it. I have no ill feelings towards it. Yes, it's silly, insane and almost a B-movie in many ways, but it does so like a child. I can't get mad at it, and I hope none of the people involved are ashamed of it because movies like this bring real joy to many people. If I was 12 years old, this movie would be my personal treasure.",Gods of Egypt
102,iantrader,A good movie but it tries too hard,5,19 January 2018,"Yes, it's epic in every way, with a sterling cast, stirring music and more CGI than you can shake a stick at.And that just might be part of the problem 'cause there's more CGI than actors and, well, heck, don't you just get sick and tired of scene after scene after scene which you know isn't anywhere near real. When you can do absolutely anything, the anything you you do must be truly original and outstanding and that's a far harder trick to pull off.Not singling out this movie - many blockbusters that rely on CGI hit the same problem. Oh well...The often-dim lighting, yellow (sand/Egypt - geddit) cast and fast edits don't help with clarity, either.But it's not a bad movie, sadly it's just a bit of an average one. If you like mythological themes and epic action, go for it. You'll enjoy it.",Gods of Egypt
103,metalrage666,Quite enjoyable,7,27 February 2016,"I'm not sure why this movie is being blasted by critics, but I found this to be a great movie. Much better than recent fare such as the remake of Clash of the Titans, Conan the Barbarian or Hercules. The sets are amazing as are the effects. Critics are again all over the fact that predominantly white actors are playing Egyptians, but unlike another recent movie, Exodus, where I'd expect at least some attempt at ethnic accuracy, Gods of Egypt is not trying to be a serious period movie or a telling of real life events. This is more of an overblown showy spectacle featuring horrendously unrealistic events and more inaccuracy than you'll find in a government endorsed history book. In a nutshell, the God Horus is due to be crowned king of all he surveys, however the ceremony is interrupted by his uncle, Set. After Set kills his own brother, Osiris, he defeats Horus in battle and removes his eyes. Set then enslaves humanity by creating a massive city for himself with a mammoth monolith taking centre stage. Horus has gone into hiding and a young mortal called Bek embarks on a journey to retrieve Horus' eyes and return them so Horus can reclaim his right as king. Bek manages to locate one eye inside Set's treasury and after evading several elaborate Indiana Jones- esque style traps, he secures the eye and returns it to Horus. He reluctantly teams up with Bek to locate the other eye and journey to see Thoth, God of knowledge, so he can answer the riddle of the Sphinx that resides in a constantly shifting pyramid and put an end to Set's plan to unleash chaos on Egypt. It's a simple story but what makes this interesting is the journey. The Gods are able to change into the deities that we come to recognise on the ancient temples in hieroglyphs and frescoes. The gods use these transformations for battle as this is when they're at their strongest. In addition to that we have 2 Goddesses riding giant cobras, Ra fighting Apophis the serpent of chaos, the giant riddle making Sphinx and travelling through the underworld with Anubis. Gods of Egypt isn't a history lesson; you won't learn anything about ancient Egyptian culture by watching this or any other movie remotely like it. What this is, is fun. Pure escapism on a grand and flashy scale. The effects are great and the action is relentless. Forget what critics are saying about this and just go to be entertained for 2 hours.",Gods of Egypt

As the film went on the alleged 'banter' between the Protagonist and Horus became more and more cringe worthy and oh so obvious. This tried desperately hard to have a certain whimsical humour to it and it failed miserably. The script was embarrassing, some of the performances equally so, the CGI was pathetic and in scenes where the characters were 'running' it was sadly all too obvious they were not in fact running but merely hitting a treadmill while the geniuses worked the CGI behind and around them. An overly expensive piece of Film making which really shouldn't have even been given clearance from the Studio.

Maybe it is a director's way to see the agent Egypt, but to me it felt almost like B-movie set. Story is quite predictable and not even script satisfy me. Movie rely on too much for digital effects and scenery. As it is a digital rumble effect movie it is not too bad, but I myself like too much of agent Egypt mythology to enjoy this movie story. If you enjoy CGI-effects and don't bother so much of the story you may find this movie entertaining. It remind me of Clash of Titans movies. Lot of action but not much content. You can watch this quite easily, but it wont offer you much of it's story line. It is one of those ""don't bring your brains with"" like movie. And of course it is a must to see from big screen. From television it has nothing to offer.",Gods of Egypt
110,kelly-gaudreau,Extremely Offensive,1,29 April 2019,I am never going to get those moments back in my life. A complete waste of my time. The original idea was to make a franchise out of this movie. Thank god that did not happen.,Gods of Egypt
111,chi_town_fed,Racist (Hollywood's biggest problem) and imaginative.,4,11 August 2018,"If Denzel Washington were cast as the emperor of Rome, that decision would be rightfully assaulted on every platform of social media. Yet this, and every other film about ancient Egypt casts a white actor as the ruler of Egypt.""Europeans"" of Egypt is yet another demonstration of ""liberal"" ""inclusive"" ""progressive"" Hollywood's propagation of white supremacy. They even included the typical token black character as they often do to ease their hypocritical, liberal conscience. Now that I know (according to Hollywood) Europeans ruled Egypt as Kings, Queens, and Gods; and they created the universe, my indoctrination is complete.It is extremely unfortunate that due to their inherit racism, Hollywood glorifies all things historically white such as Greece, Rome, and England. I can't count the amount of movies based on these three sick and depraved civilizations. The extremely rare occasion Hollywood puts money into a period-based, non-white civilization, they cannot resist themselves and must use even those civilizations to glorify White Supremacy by inserting Europeans into the roles of leadership, royalty, and Gods.I am sorry if this reality stings a few toes, which is not my intent. I am just sick to my teeth of Hollywood liberals preaching inclusiveness and diversity, when their films are anything but inclusive beyond the typical token-black character. When it comes to rubber meeting the road, and non-white actors getting lead roles, their White Supremacy propaganda films are anything but inclusive. This film, Europeans of Egypt, is additional proof of their ""progressive"" hypocrisy.As to the story, the overall imaginary premise gave this film potential. Unfortunately the dull writing, clumsy plot, and cartoony CGI fails to meet any mark. Europeans of Egypt writing and imaginary effects reminds me of the writing and effects of the 1930's sci-fi series, Flash Gordon.If you just want to see a movie with special effects and cartoon-like CGI, you will love this movie.""Liberal"" Hollywood is still one of the most powerful racist institutions in America. They introduce one new African American talent for every three-hundred new white up-and-comers. They voice the need for diversity and inclusiveness, but appear to be referring to diverse height and hair color among the majority European cast. Hollywood has become slightly more subtle with their overly-blatant racism compared to the days of their greatest creation, the late actor ""Stepin Fetchit"" (look him up) as well as the TV show called ""Beulah"" (look this up on YouTube).Europeans of Egypt had a lot of potential and could have even evolved into a franchise, but Hollywood could not overcome their century-old nature of exalting members of the European culture over the historical culture of the region. They attempt to shove a racially inaccurate round peg into a square hole every time. Ever notice how they never exalt black rulers over Greece, Rome or England? Blacks in the movies are always slaves, servants, or a supporting role (aka token).",Gods of Egypt
112,jaredpahl,"An Original Work of Mad, Wacky Brilliance. Gods Yes!",8,9 June 2021,"There's simply no justice in this world. This world where safe, sanitary entertainment is king. This world where audacity is roundly mocked and true vision garners sneers of contempt. Alex Proyas has made something ridiculous with his ancient Egyptian VFX extravaganza, Gods of Egypt. He's also made a visionary piece of summer blockbustasia. Weighed against the sterile ephemera slipping into and out of theaters today, Gods of Egypt proves its worth.It is not Egypt-the geographic region in Northern Africa-that is represented in Gods of Egypt. Maybe this is an important point to consider for those puritanical air wasters who successfully raised a fuss over this film's racial demographics. It is a mythical Egypt where ten-foot-tall humanoid gods live among their creations. The fuss is moot. One of these gods is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Horus, the heir to Egypt. Another is Set (Gerard Butler) the jealous uncle who wants what any jealous movie uncle wants; power over the kingdom. The very basic adventure outline even makes room for a thieving street rat and his puppy dog romance. This story isn't going to surprise, move, or enlighten anybody. But you know what? Neither will Captain America 5.Coster-Waldau is a serviceable hero; Brenton Thwaites is a serviceable sidekick. But Gerard Butler is the most entertaining of the cast. Butler has softened into one of our most lovable movie rogues in recent years, but we forget that his break out role was as 300's King Leonidas; a hyper-masculine icon. With Set, Butler gets another go at straight savagery, and he's as committed to the character as any he's played. There are other fine actors present; all of whom get a chance to look or sound patently preposterous. To give you an idea, Geoffrey Rush shows up with a white ponytail and a flaming headdress to shoot sun bombs at a cloud with teeth. But who cares about the actors? This ain't 12 Angry Men.A movie like this, without imagination, is Avengers: Infinity War. Bland, weightless, flat, grey, tepid, digital runoff. It's true that Gods of Egypt is stuffed with computer generated effects, digital backgrounds, lots of action, and wall to wall green screen. But there is a vision behind all the effects, and that is an all-important distinction. Alex Proyas has a passion for image-making. It's a through line in his career. In Gods of Egypt, he uses special effects not to expedite or enhance, but to create. There is a tendency to think of all CGI, all action, as the same. That's not true. Gods of Egypt uses CGI to CGI's best cinematic potential; to create worlds, wonders, images that spring right from the imagination of the filmmaker. You can see in the crowds of thousands, in the surrealist landscapes, and in the striking ancient-Egypt-on-LSD architecture, that there is a real filmmaker at work here. There is creativity on display. Wild unhinged visions of a world that only exists within Gods of Egypt's two hours.I don't want to be carried away by hyperbole. Just because Gods of Egypt is visionary, doesn't mean it's great. In the end, this is still a modern VFX blockbuster, complete with many of the smaller problems that entails. There is ample room for bathroom breaks when the action stops and the dutiful business of humor, exposition, and ""true love"" is addressed. But it is hard not to go to the mat for a VFX blockbuster that actually amazed and delighted me. Gods of Egypt debunks the theory that huge CGI summer spectaculars are inherently stale. With a director that doesn't care about looking silly, blockbusters can still be astonishing. Gods of Egypt is a great blockbuster. I had genuine fun. Not a manufactured, conglomerate approved good time, but an actual imagination high you can only get by experiencing a work of passion and artistry.79/100.",Gods of Egypt

The world created does its job of whisking one into this fanciful world of gods and such.I was looking at the credits for an entire army of CGI-people, but I didn't find them. OK, I think I found them now -- it's just that they have sooo many categories now! Perhaps they are getting smarter, and can do it with fewer people too. What a fabulous job-market for those with skills in art looking for work!!!!!!The only problem I had was the sound mixing. At times, I could not hear the dialog because of the music volume! Ding one or two stars for this!Gerard Butler is great as usual; and the other actors played well, but are unknowns to me.All-in-all, a very adept and fanciful world to immerse yourself in for the duration of the film!",Gods of Egypt
115,stermix501,Egypt Jam,5,29 February 2016,"First of all, this movie is not correctly categorized by IMDb, as it is an animation movie. Most of it looks like a Space Jam or Mary Poppins kind of movie but without the acting. Live actors play on animated (not even cgi! to me) backgrounds and wear animated armors. What annoyed me most was that all backgrounds were vague, something like bad photoshoped skies or desert sands.It's a pity they made it like that. It could have been a better movie if they had used more solid backgrounds, real scenery and more slow pace. The casting (although more Nordic than Egyptian) had great names that could have taken the film to satisfactory levels, if there was any dialogue that is! I think the 1st time the actors actually acted was somewhere in the middle of the movie and then words faded away again, leaving their place to foggy cgi. There was however some good material, like some traits of production design, a couple of action scenes and a couple of Courtney Eaton's assets, but other than that, the movie is as alive as the 2 pita-soulvakis I ate watching it.",Gods of Egypt

(i was already very tired and sleepy when i started this on Roku free movies + ads at around 01:30a last night and was about to fall asleep involuntarily a couple of times near the end but did manage to keep awake trying not to miss a moment ...)i'll probably watch it again if i do get the time later ... preferably on a larger screen (mine's a 40"" old TOSHIBA flat screen placed about 12' from where i was sitting) and i may as well even buy a copy for keeps as it is truly worth it ...again, forgive the not so realistic mythical storyline plus its somewhat mundane wrappings (as we ought to do in most similar cases anyway!) and just enjoy the VFX and SFX and lovely music in addition to some beautiful characters ... and you'll most probably like it just like i did! :-)",Gods of Egypt

Egyptian mythology brought to life o the big screen with Gerard Butler as a bad guy.The trailer makes it look like Transformers mixed with Clash of the Titans. However, I was pleasantly surprised since it had more fantastically elements than sci-fi. Butler is great as a villain and chews every scene he is in. The dynamic between Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's Horus and Brenton Thwaites's Bek helps the plot roll along nicely; though nothing deep develops (but come on, this is not your typical bromance; it's a god and a mortal). And surprise for Cambodian fans, Hathor is played by a half French, half Cambodian, and she is captivating on screen tool. It helps that Thwaites' character's love interest is lovely too. In short, the movie is not short on visuals. It also has plenty of action and 2 hours run time does not feel long at all. Also, where else can you see gods bleeding gold, and their body parts turn to diamonds. Cool fantasy stuff.",Gods of Egypt

What can I say, forget about Lenin's useful morons and their thought police whining about the cast. Nobody freaking cares, besides real Egyptians have way more to worry about lately than getting their movie careers off the ground. The plot takes a bit of a back seat to the incredible effects and visual treats but its pretty decent. At least the characters aren't running around chasing some idiot ring that only destroys them...This actually is a film about mythology with plenty of dazzling action and the good old tried and true absolute evil vs the power of love. In a weird kind of way it reminded me a bit of The Risen (another great film by the way) There are similar themes woven through both movies surprisingly.The movie is rated low here cause Bernie's politically correct wanna be tyrants come on here in hordes and slam films that don't have a communist slant.

I love a good adventure movie and fantasy to boot. Here we had a slightly promising cast promising lush CGI and action. It was a fine enough mindless diversion with most attempts at humour falling flat, a few hitting. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau channeling his Game of Thrones Jamie character to a minor extent is hard not to approve of. Butler gives a normal day at the office enthusiasm with his Character, he's alright. Rufus Sewell, underused is a silly role. Chadwick (the new Black Panther) given little time for a curious character. Anyway the whole movie was curious and the extensive CGI used simply detracted from the movie. Some of it looked simply bad and not 2016 and equivalent to its budget.

I went into the movie not having read any of the critics reviews, and when I came home afterwards, I was surprised to see so many critics have bashed the movie. The only problem that they can cite is that this movie had too many white actors in it! This was never a problem in the past, The Clash of the Titans and the Immortals were similar mythological movies from just a few years ago, also with a mainly white cast and it was never even mentioned for them. Since this movie came out so soon after the 2016 Oscar awards ceremony, which was criticized heavily for not having any black actors or black-based films nominated, maybe this movie got unfairly caught up in the fad of the times? Anyways, there's a lot to love about this film. Watch the depiction of the flat Earth, with a Sun being dragged around by Ra's chariot. They could've gone with a modern scientific depiction of the round Earth and the Sun, but this is mythology, they wanted to stay true to the mythological depiction, and so they did depict it like mythology has it.

126,antoniokowatsch,Transformers: Egyptian Style,5,2 December 2017,"I have heard a lot people complaining about this movie, claiming that it's one of the worst movies ever made. With all that hoopla I thought I might give the movie a watch.The first thing that I noticed was the overwhelmingly white cast. I don't know why Hollywood continues to paint a wrong picture of historical events as they pertain to Egypt but this is done deliberately. I'm normally not much of a social justice warrior but this is something that's just disrespectful. I mean, have you ever seen a movie about the history of China that was cast almost entirely with white people? I don't think so. Then why the exception with Egypt? I digress.The movie starts out with a fair share of CGI effects which kind of gave me an idea as to what should be expected. The CGI wasn't very convincing so it seemed a little cheap at times. Especially the ""transformations"", they were quite goofy in my humble opinion. Nowhere in the hieroglyphs does it say that Egyptian gods are Transformers so I really don't get why they decided to go this route.Storytelling-wise the movie doesn't have much to offer. It's so one- dimensional that even a child could predict most of the occurrences beforehand. The deaths that occur during the movie are what I'd call ""premature death scenes"". Instead of waiting until some sort of emotional bond can be established with the viewer the characters just die way too early. So early indeed that no one really cares. Even the other characters in the movie seemed totally apathetic towards the deaths of their ""loved ones"". I call that bad storytelling.Towards the end the movie gets actually interesting. But unfortunately that's not enough. The negative points clearly outweigh the positive ones (of which there are few to begin with), I'm afraid.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen but I wouldn't recommend it either. The movie has a strong cast, weak story, and mediocre VFX.",Gods of Egypt
127,DogFilmCritic,I've seen worst,5,6 July 2016,"Before I start this review I want to get out of the way the white washing in this movie, it's impossible to finance 140 million dollar epic movie without casting a main Caucasian cast, the predominating blockbuster actors are mainly white people with big names that the everyone would recognize. We have to remember in the end it's an American film, such was the case in Memoirs of a geisha were they used Chinese actresses to portrait Japanese ,would we call that "" yellow washing"". When you see other countries make remakes of American properties no one cares( the Turkish knockoffs mostly) or when there are remakes of foreign cinema made in the U.S. and it take place in the states with American characters cast in the roles, no one cares. My theory is that this movie looked so silly and rushed that the casting got under the skin of the viewers as soon as the trailer was out. Now that's that out of the way here is what I thought of the film. It was a very generic action adventure film, this could work in the early 2000 like in the case of the mummy and the mummy returns but now we look for more complex and story telling in a movie rather than a joyride, the acting was OK the effects were very painful, Alex Proyas is a great director but he was out of his element, he did the crow, dark city, I robot and you combine that with the writer of Dracula untold and you have a genuine flop, Proyas works with dark and dystonia settings not a happy go lucky action film.

Then you have Gerard Butler so I knew it wouldn't be a waste of my time. The film was even better than I could have hoped. I think it's more to do with the times we're living in whereby film makers can no longer get away with having two dimensional characters (and still expect a high IMDb rating) or women who just stand there looking pretty, or have an all-white cast with a few token darker-skinned people who get thrown one or two lines...erm...well, there's always going to be 'some' of that (society hasn't progressed that much) but this film at least 'tries' to avoid those clichés. The two main women have real personalities and Hathor, a.k.a. the Goddess of Love (Elodie Yung), portrays her sexuality in a refreshingly modern way (no crying about feeling taken advantage of for her own decisions etc.) The action is spectacular, there's a lot of originality in most of the fight scenes, and I liked the storyline. It was predictable but again, they at least explored other possibilities before returning to the road more travelled.Gods of Egypt was a very nice surprise and it deserves a much higher IMDb rating.

Also there were some cracking one liners, this movie, is smarter than most. The movie is all about spectacle and, rarely for modern movies, it has a love interest story that is charming and adds to the movie, rather than subtracts. This movie is not taking itself too seriously and it is all about good old fashioned fun. I really recommend it. It's safe to ignore the sniffy critics in this case.

It had a negative controversy/reaction due to the casting choices. Especially since it takes place in Egypt. The CGI didn't look all that impressive, and overall I believe it didn't receive a fair chance. I decided to give it a fair chance, and I wasn't all that impressed.Obviously, this isn't a representation of the real Egypt. This story is pure fantasy. What you have here are The Gods of Egypt getting together. Things don't go according to plan, that a$$hole Set, played by Gerard Butler (300, Olympus Has Fallen) has to have complete control over Egypt, and take over everything. Set kills, and even takes out his own nephew Horus. If Set weren't bad enough, he has to dig into Horus' face and pull out his eyeballs too. One day Horus meets Bek, played by Brenton Thwaites (Maleficent, The Giver). Bek and Horus work together to stop Set. Will Horus overcome Set's cruel rule over Egypt? Will the land of the pharaohs regain peace once again? Only time will tell.No out of all the controversy this film has gotten, Hollywood can keep this silly ass Egypt for all I care, because I sure as Hell don't want it. This movie is not good; it's Egypt on acid. The plot is loose, the history is to fantasized, and the characters are just white yogurt and plain as you can get. Call me crazy, but I think Jupiter Ascending is more scientifically correct and accurate than Gods of Egypt. They emphasis the CGI over story, which I will never understand why they do this. CGI should be used to enhance the story. The actors really do try, but the source material isn't there for them to work to the best of their abilities. Also, why is Gerard Butler the only man in Ancient Egypt with a mixture of a British and Scottish accent? (TONIGHT WE DINE IN KEMET!)I know it sounds like I'm over writing about the CGI, but I've seen video games that look more realistic than this. I've read children's books with more character development than this. 140 million dollars went into this film, and I've seen movies that go straight to the Chiller and Sci-fi channel that look far superior than this. This film is directed by Alex Proyas (director of The Crow and I 'Robot). I personally enjoy those films, and yes they are also visually stunning. But they had a compelling story around it unlike this film.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the movie Gods of Egypt. I know it sounds like I'm ranting, but if you haven't seen this film, you can skip it. It's way too much CGI, the Gods are weak, it's sexist, characters are boring, the story is loose, the characters are paper thin. The actors do try; sadly they are the only ones I believe put some effort into this project. I believe it's bland, and made for a quick dollar.

136,Wirxaw,Fantasy at its finest.,6,23 May 2016,"Gods of Egypt is one of the movies that are true to their name. Its one sole purpose... is to show Egyptian myths and gods in as much fantasy detail as possible. This is one of the movies I'd call ""honest"". It's not an over-hyped blockbuster trying to milk its fans, it's just a piece of art.Unfortunately, despite all the shining gold, it's...too dull. Almost everything you see - you have seen before. From Thor to Superman to Clash of Titans to even Asura's Wrath - the ""inspirations"" are obvious. And the whole ""love story"" is just a few steps away from Transformers.When actors are silly, racks are on display and the plot makes little sense - how could a movie possibly have 6\10?Because I saw what I came to see. Gods of Egypt. As many of them as an average movie could get in. I saw mythical detail, I saw things I'd care for as a fan of the subject since Age of Mythologies. Even if it was a bit Thor\Asura's Wrath-ized. That's also a minus, though an arguable one.If you are a fan of the subject, then this movie will not impress you, but it at least will be a fair enough watch, things can be worse. But if you aren't, I'll be straight and say that this movie will feel pretty stupid and pointless. But nowadays the definitions of ""stupid"" are judged by the franchise, marketing and critics' salary.That's why, surprisingly, this movie is not as stupid as it gets. So, to summarize.Pros: honest mythology, some semblance of moral, decent acting. Matter of taste: racks, transforming metal suits. Cons: weak plot, weak action scenes, lack of credibility.",Gods of Egypt

Seem to be drinking it from a Dart Vader picture mug (yeah – 1977) whilst listening to the soothing tones of Danny Elfman. Okay, so this author is frustrated again, otherwise sleeping in on Sunday-morning would have been the better alternative. There are no words available in the known Universe that can describe the disaster that the ""movie"" Gods of Egypt represents (it doesn't even deserve the label movie). How can anything this bad be made on a budget of $140,000,000? The script is terrible, the sets are terrible, the acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, and worse, even the special effects are terrible. It's an utter disgrace to mythology, the culture of Egypt, the people of Egypt, and even the Gods themselves are turning in their graves (or should it be tombs). What a load of absolute $#@%^ - would love to start swearing right now. Yeah, the movie comes straight from Nickelodeon (the bad part, those on the soon-to-be-sacked list) and has a target audience either aged between 5 and 10, or with an intelligence quotient close to that of being _____. You can fill in the blank spot yourself. Deep sigh this is the 3rd movie in a row that received the lowest possible score. Where is this all going?

139,lord-blade,This is what a movie should be.,10,6 October 2018,"Just downright great entertainment from start to finish. Gods of Egypt is a fun fantasy film that takes the idea of the Egyptian gods and comes up with a whole new story that's full of action, adventure, comedy and romance. Truly an epic movie.I see a lot of complaints about this movie and I honestly can't understand them. People complaining that the story isn't authentic. Well, that is sort of the point. They're not retelling the myths and legends of Egypt, they're taking the characters out of those stories and making something entirely new out of them. Something fun and original, instead of yet another remake of the same trash we've seen copy and pasted into a thousand different films. Originality, especially when it's so wonderfully presented, should NEVER be stifled.As for those complaining that the movie ""looks bad"" or has ""cheesy CGI"", it's clear that they've not been watching the same movie as everyone else. Because this movie is beautiful. The special effects are stunning, the cinematography is beautiful and they just put so much effort into every last detail. I've seen movies with 100 times the budget not look anywhere near this polished.Gods of Egypt is what we need to see Hollywood do more of. A beautiful, entertaining, and most importantly ORIGINAL concept. Something that's just incredibly fun to watch from start to finish. I would love to see more movies of this quality instead of the carbon copy remakes we keep getting.",Gods of Egypt

Some of the other Gods look and act like they've come from the set of Vikings. I mean they could have attempted a slight bit of realism in the casting process, especially when they went to so much effort in the costumes and scenery, which were really cool.

But I also knew from past experience not to trust some reviews.The movie was a lot of fun with action all the way. The effects were excellent and the story was compelling and made me want to watch until the end to see the outcome. I find in a movie if I am either rooting for a good guy or against a bad guy then the movie is doing something right and in this I was certainly doing the latter.I think maybe to improve the movie I would have started and finished in modern day Egypt with some reference to past legends or something - maybe finding some ancient artefact or similar.But on the whole a good fun movie that is worth watching",Gods of Egypt

Horus must then get revenge with the help of some mere humans. This is a world with huge gods, magic at every turn and giant monsters. Fine, I accept the world. Now, if you cannot accept the world, if you say, ""hey, Egyptian gods were not like ____, and Horus was ____."" Then this movie is not for you.What this movie is about is beautiful women, fun fight scenes and lots of action/humour. Think Indian Jones meets Egypt.One thing this movie did get flack for was that none of the cast was Egyptian - and this is a very fair criticism, but one for which many more movies than this should feel the heat for. Countless movies with Greek/Middle Eastern cast almost entirely British cast for some reason, yet escape. Why is Butler an Egyptian god? Well, why is he a Greek king? If this movie is taken at all seriously then it falls apart. Sit back, turn the brain off and enjoy a family friendly action adventure.",Gods of Egypt
146,NicolasCostoglou,"Gods shouldn't be ashamed, but at least try harder to convince us of their existence...",6,31 December 2016,"Gods of Egypt is a fine, entertaining movie, but not much more, but it's very complex for me personally to wrap my head around this film. I watched this film nearly a month ago, and it took me till now to be sure that i'm ready to talk about it...First of all, it's not as bad as most people make it out to be, and even better than i expected after watching the god awful looking trailers (sorry for the pun...).The problem for me is, that i'm a big fan of Alex Proyas work, and after hearing about how weird and bad this movie's supposed to be, i didn't wanted to see it, because i thought of all the other great directors who made fantasy/historical-effect-bombarded-movies and failed miserably. (Timur Bekmabetov with Ben-Hur; Duncan Jones with Warcraft; Bryan Singer with all his X-Men sequels; Zack Snyder with Batman v. Superman, and hell even Man of Steel; Francis Lawrence with the Hunger Games sequels...just to name a few directors i really like, but this ain't their best work.)But my father (who had the same reaction) wanted to see the film as it was free on Amazon Prime, and he told me that it was way better than expected, so we watched it together, and i think he's right...but when we say better, we don't mean amazing.But let's dig into it, shall we?The Design is amazing, it looks like ancient Egypt and the imposing camera-work let us see all the little details of this world, which is the strongest part of the film, the world-building and thought that was given to all this mythological aspects. But the special effects, which show us most of this world, are pretty hit and miss. The best effects in the movie are the different heights of the actors, the gods are much bigger as the humans, and you get a great feeling that the mortal men are nothing more but ants for these great creatures, and the interaction is (technically) even more seamless as in the Lord of the Rings. The introduction scene and the first shot that flies over the landscape look amazing and you are exited to experience this world, but there are different environments in the movie which look more like from a video game, it's hip- hopping from scene to scene, but you can look pass some of this flaws, because it's a big fantasy world.And this works fairly well, because they tell you (quiet literally) from the start that you don't have to take this movie seriously, it 's actually pretty funny at times and the actors seem all to wink into the camera every once in a while, to remind you that it's supposed to be fun.That's also a big plus of the movie, it's supposed to be more like ""Flash Gordon"", or ""Big trouble in little China"", then ""Lord of the Rings"", it just looks different because of the time we live in, but it has to have the same effect as these movies had back in the day (which got their cult-followings much, much later).BUT i don't think it's as good as any of these, for a few reasons: The movie has a pretty fast pacing, which works in a way that it never get'ßs boring at all, but it also works in exchange against the characterization of our protagonists. We know about their motivations, which is something even better movies often forget, but the fast pace almost never allows them to take their time and let a moment breath. But when there are moments of silence, they work pretty well and help to flesh out the characters, even if it's not that often. Also some of the action-adventure moments have the same issue, every problem is resolved immediately, so that it never get's really tense, which isn't to good in your action-adventure flick, but it's okay, nothing sticks out as really bad in THAT regard.The reason for this restlessness are the many action sequences, which are solid and mostly entertaining (It's great when the amazingly strong gods fight against each other, UNTIL they turn into cartoon creatures, then it's like a boring, and unearned, version of the final fight from Van Helsing, another movie which is quiet similar to this one, but also better), but as a fan of Proyas other movies, i'm a little disappointed, because he can do much better than ""solid"".It's hard to talk about Cinematography when most of the movie was clearly made in front of a blue-/green-screen, because you can't tell what's real camera-work and what's animated, but it looks good overall, you're never confused of where you are for example...so that's good...The music is also solid, it works with the movie, but it's not that memorable, which is also a shame, because all of Proyas previous movies had amazing soundtracks... i mean, all of them...The Actors do their best and (like i said) seem to have fun, so that this movie never comes near the boring lifelessness of the Star Wars-Prequels for example.It's all in all a pretty decent flick, better than i expected, and better than most people say, but still just solid entertainment.Here a few movies that are (in my opinion) better, but similar to this kind of story: ""Prince of Persia"", ""Clash of the Titans (2010)"", ""The Mummy (just the first)"".",Gods of Egypt

Seeing a movie like Gods of Egypt evokes the same feelings of awe and wonder from my childhood, but now with modern Hollywood quality CGI, looking better than anything from the fantasy films I watched as a kid.This is a visually impressive, imaginative, fun fantasy adventure with likable characters, in a classic story of good vs evil, in a unique setting, a fantastic version of ancient Egypt that's like nothing ever seen in real Earth history. What's not to like?Highlights: - An action scene with two gigantic fire-breathing snakes. This is why we watch action fantasy, for cool scenes like this.A giant world-eating space worm.

It's full of visual effects and a good amount of action, with a very simple plot. The movie has more humor in it than I thought it would. However, it does run a bit long and at times I just wanted the plot to move forward a bit faster. I try to keep my reviews short and to the point.

They are savagely mauling this movie but it is better than both of the recent Clash of the Titans movies combined. They have forgotten what it is like to have fun at the movies. There is utterly astonishing world building here. Rich elegant costumes and set designs that remind me of Liz Taylor's Cleopatra. Breathtaking stunts. The unknown cast contains Marvel's Black Panther Chadwick Boseman and Daredevil's Elektra Elodie Young. Both of these two rising stars give great performances and each of their roles seems to be a preview of what they will bring the MCU.

153,yourfavoritecritic,Filmmakers of Messiness,3,24 April 2021,"Gods of Egypt is directed by Alex Proyas, written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless, and stars Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Chadwick Boseman among others. The film tells the story of a mortal named, Bek and the god Horus coming together to thwart the plans of Set, a merciless god who usurped the throne of Egypt turning the once peaceful empire into one of chaos and destruction. Released in February of 2016, Gods of Egypt was met with negative reception from both audiences and critics, leading the film to struggle at the box office which barely turned a profit during its theatrical run.Going into Gods of Egypt I was expecting the worst, given the reputation of the film, however, while the movie is certainly bad I didn't hate the experience while watching it. That may be due in part to the adventure the film takes the viewer on, although it strikes every trope in the book and feels like a culmination of every fantasy adventure story ever, there were moments along the way in which I felt entertained. Some of the visuals the filmmakers tried going for were nice and almost felt atmospheric, however much was held back due to how poor the special effects were. Gods of Egypt relies very heavily on CGI, with almost every scene packed full of effects that do not look too impressive. This overabundance of poor CGI severely hurts the quality of the film, while the effects are not the worst ever, the film's dependence on them really brings it to the forefront and it's noticeable that Gods of Egypt could've spent more time in the oven better developing the effects as to not hurt the quality of the movie and more severely date the film; as this is a movie that will negatively show its age in ten years similar to that of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace a movie that was over-reliant on CGI, however that's only if people even remember Gods of Egypt.As I stated earlier, although aspects of the journey can be entertaining, much of the story comes across as a greatest hits in terms of the fantasy adventure genre, resulting in a film that is quite forgettable, at least to me. This left me questioning why this film was even made, it's certainly not the first feature-length to be about Egyptian gods and the whole aesthetic felt like a PG Immortals with worse special effects. It's certainly not going to be a film that will stick with audiences after seeing it nor will it be as entertaining while watching as the filmmakers probably hoped it would be.Gods of Egypt is more or less a messy film, although it was something that I didn't hate as much as I thought I was going to, it undeniably has issues. From the reliance on poor CGI, cliché ridden story and long-winded run time make for a film that surely isn't great. Gods of Egypt has its moments of tolerability, however, it definitely isn't a film that I can recommend and for that reason, I am giving Gods of Egypt a 3/10.",Gods of Egypt

156,ryanmark-57919,What a Disappointment,5,29 February 2016,"I didn't really have any faith in this film being decent when I saw the trailers but I figured it would at least be a bit of silly fun at the theater. Well, I've seen the movie and I can certainly confirm that it's not very good and it's nowhere near as fun as I was hoping it would be. To be fair, there are entertaining aspects to the story and some of the action (keyword being 'some') is cool to look at but overall the film just goes on for way too long and nothing really comes off as spectacular or very well done. I've enjoyed some of Alex Proyas's movies in the past but this one just left me disappointed and I found myself wishing that it would hurry up and end.The story focuses on an alternative world and Egypt where the Gods from Egyptian Mythology live with and rule over humanity. Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is being made the new king of Egypt by his father, Osiris (Bryan Brown), when a bit of family drama throws the succession plans out the window. Set (Gerard Butler), Horus's uncle, murders Osiris and tears out Horus's eyes after a short battle. Afterwards, Set rules over humanity and goes to war with the rest of Egypt's Gods. In all this confusion, a young human named Bek (Brenton Thwaites) is convinced by his wife, Zaya (Courtney Eaton), to steal Horus's eyes away from Set so that Horus can regain his sight and the power to save all of humanity. An overbearing adventure awaits everyone.The cast is actually composed of some talented people but it still feels like the acting comes off as sub par here. Coaster-Waldau does a decent enough job as Horus but I never really cared very much for him despite all of the hardships he went through. I believe they were going for a likable rogue type of character but he really just came off as a prick. Brenton Thwaites seemed alright as Bek but once again it just felt dull watching him say his lines and interact with the other characters. I have a feeling the fault for this lies more with the direction and lackluster script than it does the actors. The most disappointing one to me was Gerard Butler. This very much just seems like a lackluster performance in order to get a quick paycheck. Even then, I enjoyed watching Butler but his portrayal easily stood out to me more than anyone else in the story, and not in a good way. It's strange to say, I think Butler's accent had a lot to do with it. No one in this movie even attempts to emulate an Egyptian accent but Butler's brogue just snatched me right out of the film every time he spoke. I'm not sure why his voice did it and no else though.There are a few cool looking things in this movie that keep it from being completely forgettable. The environments are interesting and the weird bizarre scenes that take place on a ship sailing through space (stay with me) look kind of cool. There are also a few action scenes that I thought were done pretty well. Unfortunately, there's not enough of this to make up for the plodding pace of the film and laughable cgi. Like I said, I enjoyed the scenes that took place on Ra's ship until I saw Geoffrey Rush supposedly surrounded by ethereal flames while fighting off some giant demon. The demon looked alright but Rush just came off as goofy looking. It feels like the creatures in general looked a lot better than the Gods and the effects associated with them. As far as the pace goes, this film would have been a lot better if they cut out some of the fluff. When I say some of I actually mean about a quarter of the movie. This story really drags and I found myself peeking at my watch on a few scenes. A tight ninety minutes instead of two hours would have done wonders for this film.I don't want to go so far as to say that I didn't have any fun whatsoever with the movie, but for everything they did well there were two things that felt off. It kind of reminded me of the way I felt about that Pan film that came out last year. I enjoyed some aspects but overall it didn't really do a whole for me. I can't really give this one a recommendation unless there's absolutely nothing else out there that catches your attention. Just go for the one or two worthwhile action scenes and take a nap during the second act.",Gods of Egypt
157,bartonj2410,"Well, I guess I'm a diseased vulture then...",2,19 June 2016,"There are films that are so bad they're good and then there are films that are so bad they're just bad. Gods of Egypt very much falls into the latter because it really is just an awful film. Weirdly, I'd been anticipating this film for a while and it's finally arrived in the UK, a whole four months after its release across the pond.Although I'd heard nothing but bad things about Gods of Egypt, I was always keen to see for myself whether it was actually that bad. Alex Proyas, the director of this film, came out in defence of his work and described modern day critics as 'diseased vultures pecking at the bones of a dying carcass' back when the film was originally slated by critics who got to see this total mess four months ago.Here I would normally give a brief rundown of the plot however, due to the scattershot nature of this film's plot, I will try my best to keep it as brief as possible. Betrayed and exiled by his uncle Set (Gerard Butler), Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is a god who was to be crowned the new King of Egypt. Under Set's reign, Egypt descends into chaos and human Bek (Brenton Thwaites) takes it upon himself to find Horus and persuade him to return and defeat Set to regain his rightful place as the King of Egypt.I can't stress enough just how embarrassing every aspect of this film is. For starters, there is not one actor who gives anything resembling a good performance, whether it be Gerard Butler as Set or Geoffrey Rush, yes Geoffrey Rush, as Ra. I've never really been majorly impressed with Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau in Game of Thrones and he does nothing that could possibly change my mind in Gods of Egypt.Elodie Young is in the same boat in the way that she never impressed me too much in Daredevil and she's not very good here either. The worst of the bunch though has got to be Brenton Thwaites as Bek, who has more or less the same delivery for every emotion; utterly emotionless.Then comes the writing...Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless are a writing duo who haven't written a well received film yet in their three attempts. This is the only film of theirs I've seen and if this is anything to go by, I will be avoiding Dracula Untold and The Last Witch Hunter. The dialogue is so laughably bad throughout the entire film and the story jumps from scene to scene with no cohesion whatsoever. I don't think I've seen a film where I've laughed at nearly every single line before.Alex Proyas, judging from his comments about critics, is not a man who can take any criticism lightly. I would be able to describe Proyas as a style over substance director if the visuals were any good but they just aren't. For a film with a $140 million budget, you'd think they'd at least be able to make it look good. It makes me wonder whether they just blew all of the budget on the cast. Gods of Egypt feels like you're watching someone play a shoddy video game rather erratically, particularly during the fight scenes where Peter Menzies Jr.'s cinematography will leave you dizzy and wanting the sick bucket.Are there any positives I can take from Gods of Egypt? Marco Beltrami's score was probably the best thing about this film and oh, the film did finish eventually which was a bonus. I felt exhausted as I left the cinema because the film is far too long at just over two hours, it becomes a chore to watch, especially when going in to the cinema thinking it was going to be just an hour and a half long.As of now, Gods of Egypt has surprisingly made a profit on its budget. Not a profit the studio would be hoping for though, coming in at a measly $2 million. Sounds stupid to say that's a measly amount however, in today's market, that's an amount that could well see careers end.",Gods of Egypt

I was bored and decided to give this a chance, even with all the negative reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. I actually had a pretty good time with this movie, despite the lack of appreciation from the other filmgoers in the theater. All of the action scenes will satisfy the 11 year-old audience because of the ridiculousness, and the adults will be instantly entertained. As for the CGI, it's not too bad actually, most of it looks really cool, but the green-screen is used way too much, which is my one downside that I had while watching it. The Sun God and the villain stole the show for me, they were just too awesome in those epic action sequences. Before you watch this movie, which you should, it's a really good time, see the 3D version, this is the only movie released so far this year that uses it correctly, and it helps the action look slicker and shinier and makes the green-screen look better and make the actors standing in front of it pop out more fluidly.

I thought the opening sequence was great; I thought some of the imagery was beautiful (mostly the beautiful colors); and I thought both Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau and Geoffry Rush were pretty good. Actually they were the only good source of acting in this movie, in my opinion. I also thought that Anubis was very well portrayed, and looked very good. On that thought, the entire after life setting was pretty great. Even though the imagery look good, the CGI was way to over the top at points, and downright laughable at others. When a chase scene reminds you of a chase scene from a movie from the 20's (moving picture background), it's pretty bad. Other scenes just looked choppy, almost like they were rushing through and instead of cleaning up the shots they just went with it. Also, I totally understand the ratio of gods to humans; however, it only managed to look really ridiculous. The acting was bad, like really, really, bad; overacting at it's prime. The dialogue is even worse than the acting, and the ""humor"" in the movie is incredibly unfunny. As I mentioned earlier only two actors really kept me somewhat interested in what was going on, and even after a while they got a little hard to bare. I do love the story they were trying to tell, I just don't think they pulled it off well at all.",Gods of Egypt
163,benjaminwg,Increasingly entertaining and surprisingly moving,8,6 March 2016,"I think there is an unfair ethnocentrism being exhibited by critics of this film's casting. I never heard people complaining that movies about Christian mythology, Greek mythology, or Roman mythology lacked the ethnic casting of their respective regions. Did Wrath of the Titans get demeaned because there weren't enough Greeks cast as Greek gods or demigods? Or how about not enough Italians cast in the Thor movies? There are actually a substantial number of Arab and African actors cast in Gods of Egypt, not to mention the scores of extras about. The two young actors playing mortal characters ran away together, from where we know not. And of course the gods are from wherever and are not even as homogeneous as the critics are claiming. The principal leads are either from Europe or Australia, because the director is English-speaking and is from Australia. Me thinks perhaps some of the protests are feigned outrage over this film's diversity so as to prevent people from watching it and having anything to do with their region's pagan past. After all, there has been one particular religion's more literal followers' 1400 years of ethnic cleansing and attempts to erase it. This is humanity's myths and you do not own them.

How this movie is terrible or how the crew making it just kept arguing over story problems and slammed everything together to ultimately make it terrible.Gods of Egypt is one of the worst fantasy movies ever made and a complete waste of time for everyone making it. It unfortunately is brought down by terrible writing that delivers a boring and unengaging story, ugly-looking visuals that often seem unfinished, poorly-crafted action scenes, a cast of boring and generic characters, unexpectedly offensive stereotypes, and TERRIBLE acting from celebrities involved where it's easily noticeable that they JUST DIDN'T CARE about this movie.In the case of the recommendation, just don't bother. This is one of the best examples there is of a movie that's not worth your time. I wouldn't recommend this to action junkies, since they'll be both bored and disgusted.

Whilst not as bad as the wastage on wars and religion, it is firmly high up there on the simply horrid scale.

167,Z21708,A guilty pleasure of mine.,7,25 August 2019,"Is this movie bad? Yes. But is it still fun to watch? Hell yes.Honestly, if this movie was comparable to a ""Star Wars"" movie, it'd be one of the prequels. The use of so much CGI and ultimately wooden acting is very reminiscent of how I feel about those films. Some effects actually don't look that bad, whereas others look horrible. For example, the scene with the giant snakes didn't look terrible in terms of CGI. But the scene with the minotaurs looked horrendous. The action is at times laughable, but there are other times where it actually looks pretty damn great. And the soundtrack is amazing.Not a great movie at all, but it's still kind of a guilty pleasure of mine. If you haven't seen ""Gods of Egypt"", you're not missing a whole lot. Definitely check it out if you're interested, though.",Gods of Egypt
168,AdrianOlonan,"""Gods of Egypt"" is Above the February Movie Line! But Because of Casting Choices and Over-reliance on CGI, I Give it Stars of Nine.",9,24 February 2016,"I discovered ""Gods of Egypt"" when it was suggested by ""The Divergent Series: Allegiant"" trailer. It's very attractive for a fantasy action adventure movie. A story in the ancient Egypt is very refreshing to me, especially featuring gods instead of mummies. February feels like a passive month for movies, where usually romance and drama films dominate. Thankfully, this awesome movie is released.Set, the god of the desert, has taken over Egypt. Mortal hero Bek joins forces with Horus, god of the sky, to restore peace and order.It's a visually stunning movie from start to finish. For a 140 million USD film, this is impressive. Fight scenes are well- choreographed. Music is great. Set pieces and props are intricately detailed. I like the scenes featuring the giant serpents, the goddess of love Hathor, the god of wisdom Thoth, the Sphinx, and the booby traps. There's also a memorable scene where the afterlife is featured, where the dead will offer gold heavier than the white feather to enter the next life. The movie also immerses you into the Egyptian environment.However, I just don't like how the main cast is mostly white. Ancient Egypt is composed of Blacks and Arabs. I understand that the studios are betting on Gerard Butler for his ""300"" and ""Olympus Has Fallen"" movie successes. He's prominently shown in trailers and TV spots, even though he's a villain. Also, some scenes heavily rely on CGI instead of practical effects. The armors of the winged creatures, who are Set and Horus, feel like taken from a video game. A scene where Set is riding a chariot feels CG-dependent. I guess they should have used CG to be the icing and not the cake base.On a lighter note, I appreciate Lionsgate and Alex Proyas's separate apologies for the casting choice. Probably Australia's rules for tax incentives and relying on well-known actors are primary factors. They're humble enough to admit their shortcomings. I love the film. I'm actually delighted that this comes out on Feb. 24, just three days after my 21st birthday! It's a gift! If they include a racially diverse cast for a sequel, I'll see it with greater excitement.",Gods of Egypt

170,makka-00955,White Egyptians and perfect annunciation ruin the illusion,7,22 May 2016,"I thought this was quite a good movie in the end, however, there were certain things which you had to get past and, for many, that was probably impossible. Firstly and most ludicrously, 99% of the cast is white and just didn't work, on any level, for a movie set in Egypt. Secondly, everyone has a ridiculously overdone generic English accent. What Americans don't seem to grasp is that (a) less than 0.1% of English folks just don't talk like that (b) English is not about pronouncing every single letter in every single word, perfectly. Even the poshest of folks don't speak like that - I think THAT is the movies biggest problem. The actors seem so preoccupied about perfect annunciation that they forget to act naturally. The black fella, Chadwick Boseman, who played 'Thoth', is especially guilty of this and his dreadful attempt at being English ruins his character's credibility; if he'd spoken with an American accent, no one would have noticed as much. The CGI is fabulous and the story isn't a bad one. The casting was a bit off and it did come across a bit like they'd spent so much on cgi that there wasn't enough for some more proper actors. I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong at first and then it dawned on me. It was as ludicrous as casting white folks in 'Roots' and asking them to do African accents. Once I forgave the actors for this I really started to enjoy the movie. Please, please, whoever made this movie; if you are thinking of doing a sequel, fix these major issues! Because there were no indigenous Egyptians and no attempt was made to even disguise the actors to look like any, you just never buy into the movie 100%. It doesn't feel like ancient Egypt and you have to work really hard to get your head around that. We have among others, Danish, American and Australian actors - who's idea was it to make them all speak in this ridiculous fashion?? Anyway - try to ignore this and it's quite a good film.",Gods of Egypt

Gods Of Egypt has very hot guys and gals so no matter what your sexual preference is there's somebody who will get you excited. The acting is excellent. There is real chemistry between the actors. I identified with many of the story's characters. That made me feel good. You don't need to know anything about the Egyptian Gods to understand what is going on. The story is well balanced, it has a solid beginning, middle and end. The Gods of Egypt keeps your interest from beginning to end. There's a lot of variety. So much is going on and that's one of the reasons I love adventure movies. The cinematography and the CGI are fantastic. You really enter another world without hesitation. This Is Pagan Friendly Film About the Egyptian Gods! There's no camp here. The Egyptian Gods are respected and feel quite real. This is a story about love, hormones, real courage and dare I SAY SELF-SACRIFICE! Yes! There is a really positive spiritual message in the Gods of Egypt.Wow!",Gods of Egypt
172,pendenquejohn,Interesting movie,4,27 December 2016,"Great movies on ancient Egypt are always very interesting and quite captivating. I've always paid some kind of interest in mythology for whatever reason because whether you like it or not they are in a similar way to soap operas with a little bit more action. There was almost everything in terms of ingredients in regards to what one should expect from such a movie. A hot spice of betrayal, romance, adventure, some humour and action. In other words, something you would very certainly enjoy in couple or in family.First, I have to say that Elodie Yung for instance is the real incarnation of perfection. She is unlimited with her beauty and I'm not sure of another type of profile that could embody this role. She is graceful and suits the role of a princess/goddess in a variety of ways and to perfection. She has a certain sense of humor, of entitlement, class and elitism that I really did appreciate.On the scenario itself, it was interesting and actually did make sense till the end. However, the romance around Courtney Eaton became annoying after a certain time and I did feel that it could have been tempered a little bit. I understand that they love themselves and I also understand that in Greek mythology there has always been these kinds love struggles but I found that was a certain form of obsession for her. I know they love themselves, but that was becoming a little bit overbearing.The action scenes were sometimes quite impressive to say the least though one could see that they were entirely manufactured through digital process but this was not enough to disrupt the overall good quality.While there was some visible scenes of humour, I think this aspect could have probably been explored a little bit more with the characters. I think there was attempts but that trait was underused quite a bit. For example, the whole scene when they were on their way to meet Chadwick Boseman including the one where they were actually with him had some interesting sequences of humour which were not entirely pushed to their advantage. Knowingly, this was not a comedy but I did think that it brought a different perspective.Globally, the main negative point is related to the animations of the gods when they transformed themselves. Like I had previously said, on some aspects you could see the computer at work. Some of them lacked fluidity and natural feel compared to the rest.Finally, to continue on the environment, some of the landscapes did also lack a certain feel of reality for the same reasons. That scene with the horses for instance with Courtney Eaton, you could easily see the green background.Despite these small technical detail, from an overall standpoint they were quite beautiful and there was a lot of variety into which the characters were placed. Generally, this is one aspect that I appreciate in movies related to mythology. You get a wide array of characters and unexpected elements that make them fascinating. This generally makes the movie extremely dynamic and interesting for the spectator.I would say in general, this was a good movie that I would recommend.",Gods of Egypt

174,dimbost,A Visual piece of no story,4,2 March 2016,"At first i was actually excited for this film, saw an interview with Gerard Butler, where he was trying to say this was going to be his ""Gladiator"" and then i saw the trailer. The trailer shows what you are expecting, and that is a visual spectacular of the mythological gods and cities of ancient Egypt. It also alludes that there film is based on some story. That is a lie.I don't usually do negative reviews. Unless the film is really terrible, and even so i like to talk about the positive aspects of that film too. So I will start with the positives. The film has some pretty cool visuals for most parts, and I do mean for most part, there are moments where it looks like you are watching cinematic clip from a game that is equivalent to PS3 graphics. The rest of the film is filled with colorful and what i'm hoping for is expensive CGI to make the film stand out on its own and bring people into the cinema to get their money back. Because honestly neither the story or the acting would do that.Story: now i'm not really sure who wrote the script, and where was the script supervisor during production. The story was all over the place, and just to give you an idea of what i mean. Why is that gods can die? why are they bigger then humans? and if only gods are bigger then humans to showcase that they are gods, then what about their big guards? are they demi gods? why do they bleed gold? why do they not get stronger from the prayers of mortals. Why is one mortal has the speed of a god, and the strength to withhold a gods mighty punch??.. So, there are a lot of questions and plot holes to ask and cover. That's why i choose to skip over it. its simpler like that.Acting: I really have to say that acting was pretty terrible. Not just from new comers, but even from A-list'rs like Butler,Rush and Waldau. But it wasn't as bad as the new faces that played the love couple or the actress that played the love interest of Horus.Overall this film fails, not for it's lack of originality, but for trying to be too original and skipping over a lot of important information and key turns in the film, for allowing the film to have scenes which looked out of place and felt like they were made on Windows 97, and for really bad use of Green screen. The ride through town on the chariot is a perfect example.",Gods of Egypt
175,modernmonstersdotnet,Keeping Up With The Kardashians,3,21 September 2016,"In movies there are the good, the bad and the ugly. This one takes the cake of the latter, eats it, digests it, evacuates it and proudly shows off the result on screen. In other words, it's crap.Not only pilfering the Egyptian pantheon but unable to make anything of it, Gods of Egypt pictures its titular characters like temperamental imbeciles, almighty beings only able to settle their quarrels by way of bad one-liners and fisticuffs. They are helpless fools, a bit like the Windsors, but working out, and very tall. They also are modular and bleed gold.In order of appearance, please meet Osiris (Bryan Brown) who's about to crown his son Horus (Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau) king, because that's what immortal gods do, in front of a large crowd of which we'll follow only two humans, Thief of Baghdad Bek and his girlfriend Zaya, ""beauty of the Nile"", according to the poster. Argh. Osiris' brother Set (not Seth, since Gerard Butler can't spell), until then relegated to the desert, crashes the party, kills his brother and enucleates Horus, whose all-seeing eyes do not prove very effective on that instance. Horus is not killed thanks to Hathor, the Goddess of Love.We are treated to other divine cameos, like Ra, the God of Sun (poor Geoffrey Rush, slumming) driving a celestial pedalo in hot pursuit of Apophis, the Night Snake, or like Thoth, the God of Knowledge (Chadwick Boseman), who's black, gay and a comic relief as he lives amidst clones of himself. Oh, and he's God of Wisdom, since the writers have no knowledge whatsoever of their subject matter: the thief will save the day while Gods bicker at each other. He's the audience, see, the one we can identify with.CGI is constant, allowing pyramids to grow like mushrooms. Egyptians can't build robust architecture but they are a very innovative people, inventing things like the umbrella or the elevator. Godly traps prove childishly easy to avoid. The Afterlife is crowded like a peak hour subway. It is, all in all, super easy to kill a God.Dialogue is abysmal, from the Sphinx saying anything but ""Bummer!"" when his riddle is solved to anything regarding Hathor. ""Ah, you are not so good, Goddess of Love"" deserves to join another pantheon, the one of worst movie lines ever. She answers in kind ""I am the Goddess of too much!"".

WHAT?,7,29 July 2017,"How often do I have to watch horrible films propped up to be greatest thing since the sliced bread only because they follow the trend our little globe is obsessed with at the time? How many times do I have to pass on a film because it made some people mad because it did not adhere to the trend of the week? The answer to both questions is infinite amount of times.Gods of Egypt as its title implies is a historical flick about the people living on Venus's moon number 12436 named Egypt... Wait what? it is actually a fantasy movie? About Mythological beings? Its cast is also actually diverse with a cast of people with different ethnicity? What is the problem then? I mean you do realise that there were no gods flying around Egypt some thousands of years ago right?Here is the thing, as a ""POC"" I am sick and tired of people talking for me all the time about how I should feel about stuff. This movie too is one of those cases. It was bashed to hell because its cast included white people and not black people (false since it does have black people, I mean come on, one of the gods is even black) which is a very bad argument for deciding how good a film is not to mention the fact that biological and historical evidence does not support this argument. Because of this reaction a very good fantasy adventure movie with a nice plot line, good acting, diverse cast (actually far more diverse than the upcoming BLACK PANTHER (which I don't mind the way it is anyway)) and interesting visuals bombed badly in the box office and the so called ""progressive"" media celebrated its demise.Well that is sad.Now lets get to the movie. The king of Egypt which happens to be the God Osiris is about to celebrate his Son Jamie Lannister's coronation day(wait what?) when King Leonidas comes along (Didn't see that happen!) and says something about being Set God of darkness and Kills Osiris and makes Jamie blind by removing his eyes (Jamie is the tree that keeps on giving, His hands, his eyes, what is next? his gold member? Get it? eh? eh? ugh, what am I doing with my life?) With Osiris dead and Egypt under the rule of cruel Spartan King and King slayer blind our film really starts. Our hero Bek is a faithless infidel even though he is seeing the gods basically everyday not like a certain some other God who shall not be named that is never around but yet commands worship... where was I? Oh yes, Bek has a wife named Zaya, Zaya unlike her faithless husband believes in Gods and that they can do good specially Horus (and for some reason everybody keeps calling Jamie Horus even though he clearly is Jamie. I wonder if this is a prank by Cersi played on Jamie) and believes that he will return to save the people of the land from Set's (King Leonidas, come on people!) tyranny. In an attempt to bring back Horus Zaya persuades her husband Bek that happens to be the Aladdin of the Egypt to steal the eyes of Horus back and bring them to him so that he can rise up and take back his throne. Needless to say Zaya dies and is sent to the land of the dead to face Lord Anubis. Bek in hope of saving Zaya takes her to Horus and makes a deal to help him get back his power and in return he would bring Zaya back. Oh while we are at it, Captain Barbaossa is sailing on his brand new space ship with his sun beam laser staff in earth's Exosphere and fights a giant space kraken, I hope it doesn't end up being a vital plot point down the line.So yeah, as you can see the story is packed with plot points that all connect together well. The movie uses CGI heavily and it is not done bad, it is a nice mix and does not put you off, all the gods have a transformed form that is completely cgi which could have been done better, but it is still very much watchable.The acting in this film is not anything that is Oscar level but is very pleasant and does not make you wonder why in hell you are watching this movie (ehm Ghost Busters 2k16 ehm) and the actors are endearing. There has been a lack of really good fantasy action adventure movie lately and God's of Egypt really delivers on that, it is just such a shame that it was not received well in the theaters.

It stars Gerard Butler, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Courtney Eaton, and Brenton ThwaitesMortal hero Bek teams with the god Horus in an alliance against Set, the merciless god of darkness who has usurped Egypt's throne, plunging the once peaceful and prosperous empire into chaos and conflict.Mythological stories were often told to teach a concept that was too elusive to be understood otherwise. For example, the story of Echo and Narcissus, was meant to define what narcissism entails and explain what reflections were. Like all mythological stories, Gods of Egypt, teaches all aspiring writers and directors, how not to make a fantasy movie.There's little to nothing good about the monstrosity movie seems. With that said I did reap some enjoyment out of this senses- assaulting trip to Egypt. This is a film that I can definitely say will become a cult film one day as it is a true train wreck in every which way. But, like in all train wrecks, it horrible, tragic, yet irresistible viewing. Perhaps the most entertaining part of this circus freak show, was the script. Everything but coherent, Gods of Egypt's two writers seemed to have truly thrown in the towel in this endeavor as each line progressively sounds like it was ripped out of a poorly made X- rated movie. This 'style,' if I may call it that, is complimented by the overly convoluted story that fails to engage the audience past its first few scenes. Rather I found myself focusing on how many times Gerard Butler tries to imitate Nicolas Cage. Moving past the laughable dialogue, Gerard Butler delivers a villainous turn as a man who wants to freeze Gotham city, Mr. Freeze. Wait a second.I think I got the wrong movie. Though Butler's over-the-top performance was far from good, he stands out as the rest of the cast seem to be completely blasé towards this 'epic' fantasy movie.To add insult to a mortal injury, the direction in this movie feels overly stilted and scattershot. This is particularly annoying since I used to be a fan of some Alex Proyas' early works like Dark City and The Crow. In this movie he has fully demonstrated that he cares little about the craft of filmmaking as he opts to film eye- wateringly ghastly CGI beasts duke it out.Gods of Egypt is an unwatchable mess that will one day be appreciated for its laughable content and execution.

Thank God, I am not a sheep, meaning I do take into consideration reviews from some critics, IMDb and Rotten T., but still I do take my own decision always regarding movies or TV Series I am about to watch, or I watched. That means that I consider my own rating as alpha and omega. After all it is my personal taste and not of some critic or casual viewer. Enough of philosophy, this movie attracted me no matter low reviews and ratings. So I started to watch and instantly magic happened. I was simply drawn into this world of ancient magic of gods and mortals and right from first minute of movie I was totally immersed into this masterpiece (my humble opinion). I watched movie online so I well used advantage of being able to watch scenes again and again ! This is no soap opera, everything what happens is both ordinary and very deep (depend on how subtle is your perception), action is nothing shallow but merged with strong emotions, powerful energy, very good fighting skills and good effects. Yes effects are really good in this movie and it simply got hold of your attention as everything look so real and authentic that you feel being part of it. Story is very good and not even one second boring, there is no wasting of time here, each and every second of movie is used 100% and truly there is no dull moment, absolutely no soap opera-things are very serious here, no shallow emotions life and death are constantly present like shadow and light, darkness and sun. Yes we even get chance to see personal boat and fighting skills of Sun God Ra Himself ! And that part as all other parts of movie are, is simply magnificent ! I don't know whether I will fire up someone attention to see this movie and hopefully watch it with open mind and not damaged by bad reviews and ratings,thus allow himself to fully experience beauty and greatness of this movie. I am very glad that I did, and I have to tell you that now several days already I am watching again and again scenes from this movie and feel powerful emotions and awe again and again. Allow yourself to watch this movie and forget ratings, if you do it and watch it with your 100% attention I guarantee to you that you will enjoy at least some parts of this movie very much even if is not movie merged with your personal taste. You will still enjoy some parts cause movie is truly well made from beginning till end. PS What is really amazing is that I really wanted to know which animal did represent Seth's main god warrior. I thought it was bull, but after watching one fighting scene he was involved I realized that he was goat ! Quite huge goat but still goat :-) Sorry for my grammar mistakes, I am obviously not UK or USA native, but still - I tried ;-)",Gods of Egypt

There is virtually no character development and the plot is so full of holes you could drive a chariot through it.The attractive the cast - and the female lead is stunning if you like your women all soft and dewy, inspire zero empathy and after a few minutes you find yourself paying more attention to the pizza topping if you are lucky enough to have that distraction.Gerard Butler is wafer thin as the bad God, and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau has a more interesting name than his performance as the hero God with the funky eyes in this.Maybe all the money went, or more accurately was wasted, on CGI instead of on the script, editing, cinematography, direction, and in fact everything else.The only way to get any enjoyment is to turn the sound off and pretend its a visual effects demo",Gods of Egypt

The visuals look phony and I can't shake the thought of picturing the actors surrounded by a green screen.Setting aside its flaws, this bold and unapologetic fantasy film still manages to deliver a swashbuckling tale of adventure and romance. You can't deny that this film does not delight you from start to finish.I sat there actually enjoying some of the movie: its grand-scale CGI, production and costumes, corny one-liners, razzle-dazzle action sequences, ""love that transcends death itself"" concept, etc. This is your generic ""Hollywood popcorn movie"", a movie that you can take your family to and that kids are bound to enjoy–pure escapism imprinted with pure gloss.Full review here: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/gods-of-Egypt",Gods of Egypt
189,michaeltong-29180,Fun With The Pharaohs,5,19 May 2016,"To put it simply, it's an entertaining movie if you have a little time to waste.Yes, many elements are bad. The CGI is over the top and varies in quality. The acting is uneven, but that's mostly a result of poor writing. However, it still manages to be fun.Gerard Butler steals the show with his depiction of the evil Set. He's just having so much fun, and he's invested in the role. Every time he's on screen you can't help but feel a little testosterone pumping.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is an adequate Horus. It's a typical fallen hero's journey where he has to discover himself, but in the mythical Egyptian setting it works and doesn't feel overly cliché.Brenton Thwaites, who I really liked in The Signal, did a great job with the material he was provided. He was also quite invested in the role which helps add credibility to a world that is mostly comprised of CGI backdrops.The action is mostly computer generated set pieces, but it's fairly well done. I was never straining my eyes to figure out was going on like Jupiter Ascending where they just throw CGI at the screen and expect you to figure it out.I really like the idea of taking mythological stories and turning them into super hero films. After all, Gods are the original super heroes. I would really like to see more films like this rather than ""the true story behind the myth"" kind of thing. However, they might have to take things just a bit more seriously if they're going to attract a bigger audience and get a better rating.",Gods of Egypt

I loved the twists and turns about the gods and the way they acted and when the Sphinx got the correct answer and he just went ""Bother"" which I thought was brilliant. The love story that ran through the film was good as well. I also loved the touches of Indiana Jones. All in all a really enjoyable film.

This looks cheap and tacky and I ended up half reading and watching this movie This is a real ""Alan Smithee"" movie if ever I saw one. I know that I have to write more and to be honest I'm struggling. The special effects are dire the acting is worse. Having all white cast where blatantly they wouldn't/couldn't be.

The CGI was bad... My 11 o'clock news' weatherman does more convincing green-screen work. The acting was meh. The Egyptians all looked British and/or American (this was more distracting than it sounds). The tall gods were distracting and Lord of the Rings did a better job with creating the illusion of one 5'9 man being a drastically different size than another 5'9 man, and they did it FIFTEEN years earlier. This was a bad movie, plain and simple.",Gods of Egypt
193,Venom_81,Suitable for teenagers and children's,6,14 November 2016,"Gods of Egypt is an ambitious movie that failed in some part to become a great movie. The story is set in an ancient Egypt where humans and gods lives together in peace, gods are venerated and have to do nothing than enjoy their lives because humans provide everything they need. Obviously it start a civil war between gods to gain the total power and use the humans as slave. I don't want to spoiler to much also because the story itself isn't so strong. Let's say that for the story they drew a lot to the Greek and roman myth. In what the movie failed to became a great movie? Well let's say that compared to others movies as 300 or Immortals it doesn't have a proper narrative style, it doesn't have ether a visual style. You can appreciate or not 300 and Immortals but in this movie I can see an effort from the director to give a proper version a proper style to the movie. Gods of Egypt is simply standard..no particular narrative or visual attempt to produce something new and proper. The cast works but also in this case the character are a bit flat the bad guys aren't so bad and the good one doesn't struggle to much during their journey. There is a massive use of visual effects that works well and sometimes they looks really really great . but in a couple of shot (when 2 of the main characters are trying to escape on a chariot) looks very poorly done(worst than a TV drama of the 90's) . So you can see clearly the different attention to the detail and the beauty of the works of the different visual effects vendors.Butler is the bad guy and works well also if in most of the case he look like a school bully, Coaster-Waldau could add more drama and irony to his character, make is performance more deep, for Brenton Thwaites...well for his role they can choose directly another actor. There isn't a deep watch or an historical attention to the Egyptian society and costumes, for the movie they used only the real name of the Egyptian goods and these names more or less fit the shoes of the real tradition.. But no more than that. So in the end it's a movie you can enjoy if you are a teenager ( also for the story and the two teenage actors) for an adult there are too many lacks .. it's too easy. The classic Hollywood film with budget and visual effects that doesn't leave anything..like the second or the third films of Narnia.. So teenager and children will love it while the adults will get a little bored",Gods of Egypt

There are some poc, but their roles are limited enough that I feel safe calling this ""white washed."" I know this is from 2016, but that's still new enough to be embarrassing.Other obvious issues: the plot is like every other blockbuster, which wouldn't be so bad if the characters were likeable in any way (spoilers: they're not. Even Jaime Lannister can't make me like this movie.)The worst character though is the main dude. Bek I think his name is? He has the emotional depth of a dry kiddie pool. He talks about how in love he is but when she predictably got shot his reaction was... Nothing. Within moments he was back to his unearned sass and sarcasm. Also side note: how did he get out of Set's trap with the eye? Guess that's not important. Whatever. I would've liked to see a regular guy pal around with a washed up God and then become the key to saving the world, but this guy was awful and had 0 chemistry with a washed up God that I could've done without. A better story would've seen Hathor bring the mortals together to defeat Set and send all the gods away because they really need to stop meddling.I dunno this movie is dumb guys.

197,rachaelblakeegypt,loved it,10,2 March 2016,"I just saw Gods of Egypt with my 5th and 7th grade boys on 3D Imax, and  we loved it! An original movie for a change, not a sequel, or prequel,  or reboot, or franchise, or comic book adaptation, or spin-off film.  This movie had very striking visuals, sweeping music, fun acting and  action sequences, and engaging characters. It moved along very briskly,  despite its slightly long run time. We had no difficulty following the  plot (which is certainly no less plausible or linear than Episode VII!)  or understanding who the somewhat unfamiliar Egyptian mythological  characters were as some reviews suggested we might. There was a nice  character arc for Horus, and even a thoughtful message from the gods to  humankind at the end. Ethnically inaccurate casting choices--yeah, it  would have been nice to see a more authentic cast, but these actors got  the job done, and that is no reason to skip the movie if you like this  sort of film, in my opinion.

Some of them we only see for one two minute long scene. Both Horus and Set were cool and I enjoyed seeing them kick butt. It would have been nice to see A'Nubis in action(other than the one scene where he stops the beast from devouring the afterlife bridge) I don't mind CGI, and encourage it in 2017+ but we also need a good story that delivers. If they would have made a clear divide of forces and had war between the Gods WHILE Horus & Friends continued their quest; the movie would have been much better.

Though Chadwick Boseman, and Geoffrey Rush are in my opinion the better actors of this film.

Everyone else at least fell into the fantasy hair style, costume look the audience is used to.

I guess people thought this movie to be something it was not. This movie is in the same theme as Clash of Titans or many other Greek God themed action/ Sc-Fi movies. This however is based on the Egyptian Gods and is packed full of thrills, action with great special effects. The cast has some very big banes in it and as much as all the cast played their roles exceptional the main characters are a stand out with people like Ge3offery Rush, Brenton Thwaites, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Elodie Yung and Gerard Butler to name just a few.This is a classic good Vs evil scenario with the Gods of Egypt under siege by the evil Set, but without the help of the mortals, then only can Egypt be taken out of the throes of the evil God Set.The screen jumps with magic, it is a movie with no slow parts, no gaps where you are not visually entertained. I think this movie is so go that if the writers, actors, directors etc where to do a prequel or a sequel, it would be also worth watching. This movie is worth watching if you like Sc-Fi.

204,sarine_voltage,LOVED THIS MOVIE!,10,10 September 2020,"""Don't believe everything you read,"" is how the saying goes, and I say any negativity written about this movie must have been by the hand of negative people.Granted, I do love all that is Egyptian. That being said, I just re-watched this flick (again!) and was telling a friend I thought it was maybe one of the best movies ever made... I had to look it up online becuz I couldn't for the life of me remember the director's name, tho I knew he'd done Garage Days as well--another really cool flick, btw--and I was horrified by what I saw written about GoE. I had to actually double-check that it was the same movie. I have no idea where these people could be coming from.Everything about GoE was good, if not great. I'm not an action- or special fx-driven viewer, but what was presented in that respect was well done too. The attire of the cast was so outstandingly striking that I spent a long time trying to find out who the designer was. So okay, I guess there was one thing lacking in that after reading the credits over and over, the titles given to the wardrobe people still left me with no clue as to who actually designed the clothing (so if anyone reading this can decipher it down to a name for me, I'd really like to know who it was that did such a good job). And that's about all the ""negativity"" you'll get here. Maybe the ""bombing at the box office"" has more to do with cool people opting to watch at home instead of paying $20 to not be able to pause to go to the bathroom or not be able to have a smoke or drink than it has to do with the movie itself, that's the only thing I can figure.Go watch it if you haven't already, it's such a cool flick.",Gods of Egypt

Every movie has minor mistakes, this movie has BLUNDERS and it seems they didn't care about it because they are too obvious to notice. The acting is particularly bad, but it's not their fault, they knew the movie wasn't worth the effort. Gods of Egypt is so bad that it becomes comical and you laugh and enjoy yourself.

207,mother_of_popcorn,"Big Screen Popcorn Movie, Not Cinematic Gold",4,27 February 2016,"Amidst the current climate of unrest regarding the issue of racism in Hollywood, Gods Of Egypt hasn't escaped scot-free. Similar to the film Exodus: Gods And Kings, which was also set in Egypt, there has been much talk about the fact that there are non- Egyptians playing Egyptian characters. To me, I don't think this was necessarily a conscious decision by the casting agents to directly exclude Egyptians out of sheer racism. I genuinely believe this was just a case of hiring the right people for the job. I don't think it'd be right for a studio to deliberately seek out actors of a certain racial background and ignore others who might actually be a better fit. I could be wrong – there could have been a multitude of tremendous Egyptian actors and actresses who auditioned and subsequently weren't hired. Either way, I don't think this should affect the success of a film and the level with which we enjoy it.Okay! Now that the serious stuff is over and done with, let me get to the fun stuff this movie was shot in my hometown of Sydney (yay!). It's great to witness the generation of local jobs in the film industry, so this is something I'm super proud of. We were able to showcase our range of extremely talented Aussies, both in front of and behind the camera, including the likes of Hollywood heavyweight Geoffrey Rush, legend Bryan Brown and starring up-and-comer Brenton Thwaites who already has several big films under his belt, such as Maleficent, The Giver and Son Of A Gun. He had his first big break in Home And Away, which has been the stepping stone for many a successful actor (ahem, did someone say Chris Hemsworth?). Also starring in this epic feature are international talents Gerard Butler (looking great in a skirt and why wouldn't he, he's Scottish) and everyone's favourite incest Lannister twin, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. The film was also directed by Egyptian-born Aussie Alex Proyas who has directed a range of hugely popular movies, including I, Robot, Knowing, and the cult-hit – and one of my all-time faves – The Crow.From the opening scene until the end credits, the set design was phenomenal. Everything was on such a large scale, with intricate costumes to boot. This, along with the great cast, was unfortunately the only highlights for me. The dialogue was often stilted and unnatural and the visual effects were hit and miss. There were many similarities between this title and the 2010 remake of Clash Of The Titans, which won't bode well for some. In saying that, when they got it right, it was amazing to see on the big screen and I believe this is definitely a big-scale film made to be seen in theatres if you're willing to pay the inflated cinema ticket price, that is.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com",Gods of Egypt

Don't get me wrong the movie isn't Oscar material or breath taking but surely not 5...The movie was enjoyable with some good fighting action and nice scenes.Its all about love and that being kind matters(good point if u ask me)My complaints are that the story is rushed at the beginning and doesn't give time for the audience to like the lead mortal actor ""bek"" his beloved one zaya.It would make a big difference if the film gave us 10-15 minutes more on just their story of how their love began and where it lead them.So we have 1 enjoyable movie that makes 2 hours pass lightly.

209,AlainAKoningverdraag,Could've Been So Much Better,6,6 March 2016,"This movie could have been so much better. The ideas were there, the entertainment value was there, the visuals, the cast... but yet somehow the script looked like it had been written by someone who had no idea of how to finish on the same high note as the ideas on which the movie was based. And a number of moments in the movie, where simply waiting a few seconds longer, before delivering a line or switching to the next scene would have made all the difference between epic moments or stupidly rushed parts with resulting lost effect. And this last bit, they did a number of times during the movie. It was pitiful to see such potential go to waste. Alas...So, should you see the movie? Yes. Even though they missed and or simply messed up various opportunities for greatness, such as cobras as scary as and about the size of Godzilla dying way too easily; the movie has entertainment value.

210,hennyxu,Missing the good old times.,5,19 May 2016,"I'm truly divided when it comes to reviewing this movie. First of all it's not a good movie, the acting was cheesy, the characters are beyond annoying, 80% is CGI/green screen, the story/script is half baked and the tone of the movie jumps from comedy to action to drama. But damn what did I have a good time watching this. Now LET ME EXPLAIN!!Most of you all know that I'm a man of nostalgia. I love things that can pull my nostalgia strings  and boy did this movie do that and in spades. Why you may ask? Well let me tell you. Movies these days, good or bad, have become too serious and gritty, which isn't a bad thing. However, because of this I've noticed that a specific genre of movies have been dying out. Namely, fun adventure movies, or fun action flicks or just fun movies. How long has it been since you've seen an action movie in the vein of demolition man, commando, or (to stay in the theme of the movie) the mummy. Movies that can take you on an adventure and not take itself too seriously without emphasizing the humor.DAMN Henny you're OLD!! That may be the case, but let me ask you (everyone older than 25 :P ) don't you miss fun movies? Movies with one liners, adventures with ridiculous plots, a basic message like ""be good"", and just have a good time watching it? NO? Hmmm . Well I do miss it and this movie brought me back to that time when these movies were the standard and not the exception.Gods of Egypt hearkens back to a time of simpler movie making. A homage to the times of old. However, the question remains if this was the intention of the director. If it is I find it surprising that Alex Proyas, one of the founders of gritty and serious movies like The Crow and Dark City would make something like this.Now let me sum it all up and quickly end this review (since everyone thinks that my reviews are too long).The story: The movie is about the Egyptian gods of old and during a coronation of the god Horus (aka the protagonist) his uncle staged a coup d'etat and took the kingdom and his eyes away from him. After that we follow a mortal boy named Beck (sidekick) whom steals the eyes back. And together they go on an adventure to take revenge.The bad: I've already summed up most of the bad in the introduction. What I do want to add is that the movie is too long: 2 hours. It was hard to keep my attention. I would cut 30 minutes from it. The movie also wasn't balanced, switching from a slow pace to a fast face. They should have cut some of the action and spend more time on character development and MYTHOLOGY building.The good: It was fun for the most part but it is a shame that they didn't make the script more compact. I truly liked the cinematography (even though it was mostly cgi). But I especially liked the design of the movie. I thought it was original how they have given the mythological creatures form. And I truly liked the cheesy performance of every character (except the sidekick).Three-Act-Structure: The movie has a fun interesting beginning, lazy middle, and an acceptable ending.So should I recommend this movie? Absolutely NOT. If you truly want to visit the good old times just re-watch the old movies. This was fun for me since I had nothing better to do but it isn't worth your time.I'm feeling generous today and I'll give this movie a: 5.5",Gods of Egypt
211,cobo-3,Much better than expected,8,20 May 2016,"After watching the trailer, I didn't have any good expectations for this movie. I watched it more for a morbid curiosity to see how bad it really was. And I must say, I was thoroughly entertained. The story flows from setting the stakes at the beginning, through many battles and twists it reaches a moving conclusion. And the imaginative way of presenting Egypt's mythology was very refreshing. Watching the trailer I thought they had only used the original mythology as a design guide, but they really use much of the myths accurately or well justified.Much better than Clash of the Titans, or Percy Jackson in my opinion.The obvious problem are the visuals, which vary from bad to mediocre, but many scenes were very nice indeed (like the Sphynx, I loved that one).Overall I would recommend it to any fan of Egyptian Mythology and popcorn movies.",Gods of Egypt

I occasionally read reviews before I see or rent a movie. I'm glad I didn't here. I would've missed out on a truly fun picture. The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has heart. Which is not easy to do in an action, fantasy film. I totally enjoyed the two plots, love interests and the actors that played them.

My grading system may definitely be according to what I prefer in a movie, but it's my grading system and not someone else's. Gods of Egypt was a pleasant movie to watch. Fast-paced, good character development, and a few surprises along the way. I was very happy with it. Score: 9.9/10 Stars: 4/5 Grade: A+Plot: 10/10 Overall, the story for Gods of Egypt was good, if basic, but at least they didn't try to do more with it than they did. Sometimes, simple is far better than complex (glaring at you, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice). Horus is made the new ruler of Egypt but Set wants the job, so he steals Horus' eyes and story ensues. Straight, simple, to the point, and it works on all levels. Of course, there's more to the story than just that, involving a thief and his dead girlfriend, but it all comes together nicely in the end.Character Development: 10/10 Having such a simple story, character development can sometimes get lost, but in Gods of Egypt, everyone was given enough screen time, enough motivation, and everything you were hoping for in the beginning payed off in dividends in the end (unlike some movies (again, glaring at you, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice)). I was just waiting to be disappointed by the ending, but I wasn't, and that more than anything made me happy and glad I watched this movie.Directing: 10/10 Alex Proyas may not be the world's greatest director, but he doesn't try to give his audience more than he's capable of. For this type of movie, he's a perfect director. That doesn't mean I'd like to see him take on something like Shawshank Redemption, however. But for Gods of Egypt, he directed brilliantly.Casting: 10/10 Again, for this type of movie, I thought the casting was perfect. You needed good looking men, hot looking women, and their acting didn't really matter for the most part. Again, I would not want to see any of these people take on an Oscar-worth film, but for Gods of Egypt, they did what they needed to do and pulled it off well.Acting: 10/10 For Gods of Egypt, the actors pulled off their parts well, giving the audience what they needed to make the movie good. Again, none of them are going for Oscars here, but that's fine because this isn't an Oscar-winning movie.Cinematography: 10/10 I love movies that look good, and everything about this movie was GORGEOUS. From the look of the main city to the various sets and places all the characters went, everything looked great. Yes, it was all CGI, but at least it gave the movie the proper feel. And the way the gods looked in their non-mortal forms was brilliant.Music: 10/10 No, it's not as great as John Williams in Star Wars or Indiana Jones; it's not as good as Howard Shore in the Middle Earth movies; but for this type of movie, at least it wasn't pop culture music set in ancient times. The composer did a great job, giving the proper ambiance to the movie.Pacing: 10/10 The movie didn't have any part to it that dragged. Even the one part that I thought would drag (when Horus talked to Ra) was saved by a rather cool fight scene that showed how awesome Geoffrey Rush is as an actor. From start to finish, the movie barely stopped to let the audience catch their breath.Sets and Costumes: 10/10 Again, gorgeous. The costumer knew how to clothe the actors for best effect, making the women beautiful and the men tough. Good job all around.Re-Watchability: 9/10 I consider this movie an excellent watch, but it's not perfect. I will want to watch it again soon, but it's not really something I think I could watch over and over. I may change my mind after another viewing, however. We'll see.Gods of Egypt. If you haven't seen it, give the movie a shot. You might be surprised.",Gods of Egypt

This is a movie where there are some huge stars and they couldnt even make the backgrounds look believable? Avatar did it so I think this movie could have too. Also a scene where Gerard was about a FOOT away from hitting his enemy? AND THEY LEFT THAT IN? COME ON! Obviously money was the only think on everyones mind. Awful. Completely awful. I know NO ONE who liked this movie in the least. I have NO idea how someone could give this movie a 10. That should be reserved for gems like the godfather and the like. I dont think people understand how reviewing a movie should work.",Gods of Egypt

216,fmperiset,Godless Egypt,2,9 August 2020,"If you google 'Gods of Egypt' and click on the reviews available on Rotten Tomatoes you will find an amusing paraphrase of PB. Shelley's great sonnet 'Ozymandias' which reads: ""Look on Gods of Egypt, ye filmgoers, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay of this colossal wreck, boundless and bare. The lone and level sands stretch far away."" I have quoted these lines because to me they are an accurate description of this brainless, soulless, insipid film. Despite featuring a solid cast, 'Gods of Egypt' is a massive failure which follows the standard formula of a conventional and boring action film with uninteresting characters and careless dialogue and stupid fantasy sequences. It is a fatally flawed and creatively inept effort. I will never understand why this film has got at least a 5.4 / 10 in this platform, it really doesn't deserve to pass. It takes away the fun of the sophisticated and fascinating Egyptian pantheon of deities. Overall it feels like a video game, not like a film. Come one, just look at the poster, it is telling you: 'This is going to be a bad film'. The elaborate visual effects and its cast are the only merits I can see in this deeply flawed adventure movie. You can watch it if there's nothing else in TV, and you'll probably be entertained by its lifeless fun. But on the whole this is a godless vision of Egypt.Grade: 2.3 / 10",Gods of Egypt
217,skyisthelimit925,"Entertaining and a visual feast, but the storyline is not that good",5,6 March 2016,"I personally watched this movie's trailer first and pretty impressed by it so i decided to go and watch it in theater. Generally speaking, i didn't get bored. The visual effects, visual of mythological legends and familiar faces in leading roles makes this movie at least fun to watch. But i really think that it could be better, at least story-wise. The movie has such a great idea in itself and in my opinion they didn't use it so well. If they would, there could even be a series of great films. Storyline was so simple and we've seen so many films like this before. You wouldn't regret watching it, but don't get so hyped. 5/10",Gods of Egypt
218,aubuchon,Felt like I was swimming in gold.,10,29 February 2016,"I read the mixed reviews on this board and came close to not seeing this one. I checked all my expectations at the door and just decided to allow my brain to soak it in with a blank slate and pretended that I hadn't read any reviews. One of the opening scenes has the camera sweeping in from a distance to a bustling and thriving Egypt during the early times of the Pyramids. I thought okay, that was cool but I purposefully kept my expectations low for the time being. To my surprise the visually stunning cinematography didn't stop there. The movie presents each and every scene up on a golden platter with an eye for opulence and bejeweled detail. The storyline, while not bad takes a back seat to the non-stop sensory overload of what you're seeing. It imagines the unimaginable and takes you there in a good way. The unearthly spectral realm is treated with due respect and given a realistic authenticity. This movie dresses you up in gold from head to toe then dangles you out over a ledge. The story and acting didn't really affect my opinion either way. This movie is an experience to be enjoyed like a roller coaster ride. If you try to reason with any aspect of it then you'll probably miss the boat.",Gods of Egypt
219,train1077,Miserable computer effects combined with bad cast and non-godly gods.,1,25 June 2016,"I love stories about myths, history and fables. I was disappointed.An antagonist looking like a Caucasian pretty boy that has not yet hit puberty (think boy-bands) supposed to be Egyptian. He is for some reason able to outsmart the Gods.... Talking about the Gods, the Gods are puny, especially in their behavior and powers. A blind God that can't even kill a human boy.The worst part of the film was the CGI. The fight between Horus and Set looked horrible. Some would argue that it is fantasy, not real. But it looks really bad. I happened to notice the mass of people in the background of the fight, supposed to be humans but they moved too animated.This is like a badly made superhero movie with effects from the 80's.",Gods of Egypt
220,malthenielsen,Good old fashoned fun!,8,28 November 2018,"Saw it without knowing anything about it whatsoever, and really liked it. Liked all the visuals, especially the temples and other buildings, and the sun-wagon. Liked the premised of 10 feet tall gods, it worked pretty much like a super-hero movie. Especially liked the characters, with everybody except being fairly immoral and cynical, and then some of them gradually realizing, maybe cynicism is not a good thing when a madman is destroying the world. I liked the humor a lot, and the interplay between Horus and Bek. Zaya was absurdly beautiful. It was a surprising turn of events for me she got killed so fast in the movie, only to return later on. It doesn't happen often that the death of an important character catches you completely off guard!I was very surprised it got so many many negative reriews. I suspect the reason is that it drew a crowd of genuinely historically-mythologically interested people, expecting to see a more serious sort of movie, with historically correct details and being dialogue-heavy with mythology. explanations. And then no you're not going to like it - same as if you try to watch a Marvel Thor movie for Viking mythology.So I hope it doesn't go forgotten like some of Proyas other movies. It's top notch popcorn entertainment.",Gods of Egypt
221,jaxx-68100,Very Attractive,8,15 November 2016,"I found this movie to be a feast for the eyes. It was visually very attractive in both the production and the casting. It surprises me that it did not do better in the theaters. I had to watch it several times just to get my fill of the visuals. The story was entertaining, but I would not call it spectacular or worthy of special recognition. But the story does an adequate job of supporting the visuals and their transition from one to the next. The complaints about the ethnicity of the actors was noise in the wind for me. All of the actors were attractive in their roles. This was so much the case I feel obliged to give my compliments to the person responsible for the casting. And while I am doing that allow me to give my compliments to the director. I enjoy watching movies that hold my attention and cause me to marvel at what I am seeing.",Gods of Egypt

224,rehabdoc,So bad that it's fun,7,27 October 2016,"It starts out where you're just constantly asking yourself ""Good god, did a child write this?"" It's got this silly, gravelly voice-over filling us in on mythology, which is a very arbitrary, hilariously specific variation of Egyptian mythology using the original names. Music is straight up bad Version of Stargate/Mummy ripoff. All the gods are just like 30%-40% bigger than the humans, which means almost every shot in the movie has to be digitally composited for no particularly good reason. The Gods have Gold for blood for no reason (not a spoiler. It's like the 3rd line of the voice-over). Tons and tons of overacting going on left and right. Effect are really bad. Like eye rollingly bad. The CGI is quite shiny, but they way they cut back and Forth from CGI to enhanced live footage that doesn't quite match is so jarring. Movie is worth seeing for Jeff Rush (who is weirdly reminding me of James woods here) just blasting through embarrassingly bad dialog. There is just... so... much... shiny CGI here, even for stuff that is unnecessary like the guy who storyboarded and directed didn't give a s*** what it costs, just put what's in my head on he screen. And SO uneven in quality. The fights are the worst kind of badly cut, like it was made in the 50s. Truly terrible fights, where they cut back and forth between CGI version of character lunging back to closeup of actor from different angle over and over. . But yeah good natured, naive, earnestness of the whole thing won me over. I don't think it was just low expectations lifting the movie up. It was like watching some weird foreign film take on clash of the Titans in Egypt by people who just completely lacked certain literary skills but really loved what they were doing. Make no mistake, this is a bad movie but it's exceptionally bad enough to be entertaining just for that. Watching great actors speak such terrible lines alone is worth the price of admission",Gods of Egypt

A solid spectacular adventure roller coaster from start to finish set in an extremely stylish ancient Egyptian atmosphere with a great cast is what we got!! I really don't get the cynics any more they seem to expect an Oscar winner even in the fun adventure Genre!! Was Indiana Jones ever going to win an Oscar?!! I expect these movies to be reviewed fairly in comparison with others in the same genre and in that regards this movie scores a straight 9/10 for a solid engaging story telling well acted and directed with excellent visual effects and some great costumes that glorifies this period and does justice!! Personally I am an avid move watcher and take great pride in my movie opinion and analysis and this one is certainly a must watch adventure movie if you ask my humble opinion and one of the very best adventure movies ever made about ancient Egypt it is surely miles better than the Mummy series!!The movie does a great job bringing the fantasy to life in style and sequence of events that surely will captivate the audience attention throughout. My honest opinion and advise don't listen to critics on this one actually don't listen to them when it comes to these type of movies period as they seem to have a thing or two against them for some strange reason and for that they seem to turn a blind eye towards all the glamour, style and story telling. Go watch it folks and see for yourselves one of the best blockbusters in the last couple of years an extremely amazing and memorable saga that surely will watch it over many times to come.",Gods of Egypt
228,kees_cornelisse477,It's so bad I had fun laughing at it,1,28 February 2016,"I seriously have a hard time understanding how this movie got made. There is hardly anything good about it. I really don't get why I saw what I saw, nothing in the movie made sense. I didn't give it a 1/10 because I liked some things: The girl Zaya is so beautiful, every time she's on screen I can enjoy her. The guy who plays Jamie Lannister in Game of Thrones was likable. That's pretty much everything what is good in this movie. I don't even know where to start with listing the bad things. I will start with one thing that bothered me straight away: the showing of the title. When they showed the title after the opening logos they threw a really loud music bit at it and I knew that was going to be an issue (I saw it in IMAX so everything was enhanced). Throughout the entire movie it tries to be so loud that I thought I was going deaf. Some sound effects and music bits are so incredibly loud that you can't understand what is going on. I also thought I was going blind at some points, the light switches on and off so much at points that it really is blinding. Also I was getting a headache, the camera-work is so dumb that it made me dizzy.Of course the entire movie is made in the computer, the title of the movie should be CGI of Egypt because none of it looked like Egypt. You can clearly see that everything is shot in a green screen studio because the lights on the actors never match any lights in the background. Also every background looks fake and 2-dimensional. Even the CGI on the gods is so noticeably bad, I laughed every time they changed. I laughed so hard at the changes because it looked absolutely terrible it was really funny.If you look at more basic movie terms like pacing, tone, cinematography, writing, directing, it fails at every single thing. The writing was so bad, you can tell that nobody thought there was actual ""clever writing"". The directing is hardly there, nobody delivers a good line and nothing made sense. The tone changes so drastically throughout the movie, every scene is vastly different from the previous one that you can't focus on what actually is going on. I think I tuned out completely after 15-20 minutes. The pacing also shifts drastically, I never had a clue how much time actually passed because it switches so much it's hard to understand. And the cinematographer was either drunk or high, the look of the movie even changes every 5 minutes that it's really hard to get what they were going for.So with all that said, I can say this is absolutely terrible but when you can rent the DVD you should see it because it's so bad, you'll laugh a lot. I had a great time watching the movie because my critical brain switched on and laughed at every incredibly bad thing. 2/10 because I had fun watching it and it had very few redeeming bits in there.",Gods of Egypt
229,cesar_augusto,I've played video games with better plot,5,29 February 2016,"First of all, for all the morons whining about the cast being too white, just Google ""Egyptian actors"" and send me a call if you find ANYONE who is NOT white in the first 2 pages, because I had a hell of a hard time myself! But I won't have any argument for the British actors in the middle as well, but, to be fair, Gerard Butler as the arrogant, egomaniac, evil overlord of chaos and wastelands was the most perfect choice I could've though of. But casting issues aside....Visually, it was amazing. The special effects and designs were stunning, representing the Egyptian gods in new, yet very adequate ways, except maybe for Horus who looked like a golden Iron Man, the rest of the characters looked gorgeous. And the monsters were also amazing. The backgrounds made me wish I could jump inside the screen and live there, just so surrel and marvelous they were designed.But the plot....was that a gameplay I was watching? Seriously, I could pretty much tell what was a bossfight, a sidequest, a NPC talking, a RESPAW, an upgrade, even that moment of Set and the pieces of other gods felt like an RPG character and his inventory! Brain of Tot, wisdow +5, wings of Nemphis, agility 10+, eye of horus, Accuracy +20. WHich also made this movie completely TRAMPLE the Egyptian mythology. Oh yea, the gods of Egypt do have their OWN story and it's much better than this movie's. Whoever wrote the script really had a lot of ideas, but simply wasn't fit for a movie. If they adapt this movie into a video game, it will be better than the movie.",Gods of Egypt
230,DannyDnB,Poorly executed garbage.,2,15 October 2016,"I really didn't enjoy this movie all that much. I thought that there were some parts that worked out, but there were way more that didn't, and unfortunately those weak points completely detract from the overall quality of the film.First of all, the CGI in this movie is shockingly bad. I don't know why the film makers didn't try to polish the effects up a tad, I mean they had 140 million to work with, but for some reason, they chose to keep them as they are presented here. For a movie that quite significantly focuses on the CGI aspect of movie making, this is embarrassing.The writing that went into the production is just as poor. It fell short on so many levels that I both laughed and cringed on multiple occasions. The acting from most of the cast (which is mostly British, weirdly enough) is sub par, and doesn't do much to add some humanity to the very lazy script.The only things I can say I enjoyed about this movie are Nikolaj Coaster-Waldaus performance - which is the only performance that did so much as intrigue me slightly - as well as the depiction of the Ancient Egyptian setting.This movie is mostly a complete miss, and I would not recommend it to anybody.

It's a dmn movie.Also people complaining aboit characters not being Egyptian, try to get an entire Egyptian cast that speaks English to portray all the people and characters in this movie.

He loves playing the villain. Unfortunately, no one else seemed to have a good time making the movie. The movie is only really worth it to see the first 10 minutes and the last 10 minutes. Otherwise you are better off skipping the rest. Those 20 minutes of the movie though have some pretty imaginative battles with the Gods being shape-shifters. The VFX are composited well sometimes and other time they simply drop the ball. There are some very awkward shots with the giant gods and tiny humans side by side, it just looks terrible compared to something like Lord of the Rings which was made long before this film.",Gods of Egypt

234,mlaimlai2,More like a dog than a god!,3,26 February 2016,"The main news about this movie prior to its release was how no Egyptians were cast even though the story is about Egypt and its inhabitants. Now that it has finally been released the major talk should be about how silly it is. 140 million dollars was spent to make this? The poor and homeless in Egypt should have been given this money instead. Australian backers played a pivotal role in the funding of this production. It now seems like the stellar year of Aussie films in 2015 has been diminished by this so-called God hovering over its success. 'Gods' in name only, definitely not through merit.Set (Gerard Butler) is a God of Egypt who has ambitions to reign supreme. He kills his brother Osiris (Bryan Brown) in order to ascend the throne. His nephew, Horus (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) seeks revenge for his father's death but cannot possibly do so without his eyes, which have been taken away by his uncle. Mortal hero Bek (Brenton Thwaites) finds one of Horus' eyes that has special powers, locates his whereabouts and teams up with him. Their mission: kill Set and restore order to the once peaceful and prosperous empire.The acting is simply atrocious. There's Gerard Butler's Scottish accent which seems so out of this place in this movie. There's Chadwick Boseman who camps it up as Thoth, the god of writing and knowledge. There's Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau who delivers a wooden performance. There's Geoffrey Rush as Ra, the father of Horus and Set. He must have been in it for the money for this is one of his worst ever performances. At least Brenton Thwaites provides a hero that the audience can cheer for with his energetic and kinetic portrayal of the mortal who wins the trust of Horus. Even if the movie is aimed at generating escapism qualities, it doesn't excuse the awful dialogue. Here is an example of the dialogue that will make you wince: While Set is battling Bek, he asks him where Horus' eye is. Bek replies with, ""Up your arse along with the goats!"" There should have been some script editing in the development process.There are several exciting action scenes which try to cover up the deficiencies in script and acting. It's only when the actors start talking again that you realise you have to endure further pain. The action sequences keep you awake, unfortunately the acting and dialogue do not. Where has the 140 million dollars gone? Most of it has probably gone to the visual effects which is predominantly CGI. It's not even state of the art CGI with some scenes looking decidedly fake. There is one scene involving a waterfall which is obvious to everyone that it has been generated by computer. Alex Proyas is the director and he has made a few decent films like ""I Robot"", ""Dark City"" and ""The Crow"". ""Gods of Egypt"" isn't one of them. He has gone out of control with trying to make this a visual spectacle by bombarding his audience with as many CGI effects as possible.

Or some religious crap forced fed down our throats. Just another dull action movie about testosterone.But they really are gods! This is a fantasy movie!!! And it was fun!!!SPOILERS Gods end up afraid, vulnerable, disabled, dead... Humans show courage against all odds. Showing that the classes stereotypes aren't set in stone, they don't define someone, actions does. It's inspiring.The hero is forced on a journey for revenge and discover humility and respect for people who seem less than he his but can still accomplish what he can't and help him... He learns what is truly important... and what gives true worth to someone. The ending was awesome.It's also about the journey of a simple mortal, a mere thief who aspires to better things... He seems to be a criminal but has his heart at the right place... and he fights the impossible for respect, dignity and for the woman he loves.It was a really beautiful story. There's more to it too... I liked the Grandfather Ra explaining to Seth why he seemed less fortunate when in fact he was more favored.Sure the 3D animations is corny... it's too shiny and isn't well integrated to the real life scenery and people... But transforming into a full gold robot like creature fits well with arrogant gods...The gods look human but they are much taller, being clearly a different race and not just a human lying to scare people into slavery. The effect looked off sometimes, but it helped show that they are truly different beings, and it explained why they felt superior and looked down (literally) on people.Fun fact: Gods don't have blood in their veins, they have gold. So when they demand gold offerings... what they actually want is god blood! So their gaudy gold transformation actually makes sense.Was it perfect? Nope.""Are you not entertained!!!?""

It's visually stunning and very well made for 3D viewing.The costume design is gorgeous, and the special effects are spectacular. Also, the fight scenes are well choreographed. I am not a fan of what I refer to as 'shaky cam'; the fast moving erratic camera motion which seems to be used more frequently for fight scenes or running these days. I'm pleased to say you can see exactly what is happening during the action scenes. I was in awe from the opening scene, and my interest didn't waver.

The CGI is good, if not outstanding, along with the plot and the acting. The actors and actresses look the part and often look gorgeous. Part of the depth of criticism, I believe, comes from looking at this film from a very adult view point, set your mind to ""teen"" mode and enjoy it without the critical cynical viewpoint of a jaded OAP. Break out the popcorn, beer, wine, and enjoy a film.

241,darrenmurray84,Not as bad as people say,7,7 March 2016,"A lot has been said of this movie. Even before the release there seemed to be problems regarding the whitewashing of the cast, as there are isn't one Egyptian actor involved in the production.The trailers also did not inspire confidence, with some decidedly ropey CGI used. I was hoping that this was just because of the trailers early release. Unfortunately, although a lot of the CGI is excellent, there are still parts of the film that look like a game. This is a minor nit pick though, as it is a fantasy and you can't really expect realism with this type of film.Of the leads, Gerard Butler seems to be having the most fun as the villain Set. From his scenery chewing intro, where he rips out his nephew's eyes, he doesn't let up. He also uses his own accent in this. Unfortunately he cant seem to decide what his accent is anymore. Still, he is still great in the role.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, as the hero of the story Horus, is in great shape and plays the hero well, although the character can be a bit bland compared to Butler.Brenton Thwaites is decent enough but cant live up to the two leads. The supporting cast is filled with greats like Bryan Brown, Geoffrey Rush and Rufus Sewell (re-teaming with Proyas for the first time since 1998's Dark City), but are pretty much wasted in minor roles. Elodie Yung gets a bit more to do than the other cast members and Chadwick Boseman doesn't embarrass himself too much.As mentioned earlier, some of the CGI looks more like a video game, but kind off adds to the overall look of the film. I like the fact that Director Proyas seems to do his own thing here, and doesn't give his fantasy film the expected drab, dark look that so many fantasy's these days have. I like it when a Director doesn't go with the expected. Perhaps that is why the film is failing so much at the box office.",Gods of Egypt
242,garrimagee,The Lion King...wait.. wrong movie,6,26 March 2016,"Does this plot look familiar? Yes? Oh... that's right... that movie from 1994... what was it called... oh yes, the Lion King... nothing significant. The special effects of this movie are mostly great (with exception to whatever the heck they were thinking when they tried to portray the sun god known as Ra). The cast was surprisingly well suited to their roles (once again with the exception of Ra) and the acting was fairly well done despite the hint of cheese throughout the film. Egyptian mythology buffs will appreciate the interesting take on the myth about Osiris. While certain inaccuracies were inexcusable, many of them were just liberties taken out of uncertainty and that is what made this movie unique. If I had to compare this to another movie aside from the obvious plot steal, I would compare this to Immortals (feat Henry Cavil). Like that movie, the special effects were great, but there were things that just weren't right. Overall, it gets a 6 out of 10. 4 of these points are just for Gerard Butler as he was by far the best part about this movie.",Gods of Egypt

It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet it manages to provide some kind of 'wow' factor.The story is pretty straightforward: a god is jealous of king brother and decides to end matters when the king doesn't consider him to be the next heir. Things never get too complicated, but it is interesting to see a 'new' take on such characters. This is probably where the movie is so good. The fascination of how things are shown gives one even more to look forward to as the movie goes on. The CGI looks great most of the times, but sometimes it just looks OK.Where the movie does lack is the acting department: the characters don't show enough emotion when they're supposed to, and the jokes aren't too original.

So almost all the negative reviews are based in great part on this issue. An unbiased analysis: CGI is excellent, as the gods are 50% larger than normal humans, can change form, and it all looks as natural as it could for this mythical view. Ancient Egypt - it's gods, cities, monsters, and landscape are brilliantly depicted. The Action is mostly good, although the hero does hop thru a few too many scenes and mazes such that the last was definitely too much. Acting is very good, with top flight performances by all the major parts. Chadwick Boseman, Elodie Yung, Gerard Butler were all at their best. I found the Love Story & interplay between the goddess of love and her 2 suitors to be quite unique and interesting, with Yung as much more than a pretty face. It isn't supposed to be a History Lesson, but a Fantasy and Proyas showed intimate understanding of Egypt and her gods. It is a fun movie to watch, and I have done so over 20 times already.",Gods of Egypt

Defeated good guy mourns in self-pity, until an unexpected nobody comes cheering the defeated good guy back on his feet. Together they fight against the bad king and defeat him, and everyone lives happily ever after.

There were many new and unfamiliar faces, and I understand why (they were not remarkable). Some of the better ones (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Game of Thrones) and Gerard Butler (300, P.s.

Okay, if you get past this, you could expect at least a decent and fun action, right?Well, that didn't go so good either, as the fights were in fact most cases fun to watch, if it wasn't for the, occasionally even horrible, CGI. Most of the movie and fight scenes looked more like a video game, than a movie. Although the choreography could have included some surprises, it'll pass.Okay, it wasn't probably as bad as I made it sound there, but overall is was okay, and watchable - have seen worse movies.

Discount the historical inaccuracies, it is an enjoyable movie that will have you doing research on Egyptian mythology. I will say this, the humor and one liners will have you thinking, yet it is the eye candy and fights that will keep you anticipating the next scene.

Yes the acting coulds have been better, but there is so much CGI included everywhere to develop the 'gods' side of this world, that it must have been hard to keep in character all the time when you're talking to the air.
This will be the single little flaw I saw in this movie. I don't care about Egyptian Gods don't looking Egyptian, after all who knows how they looked like? It's a fantasy setting, and it's obvious that the production staff had a lot of fun adding references to other mythologies and other views of how a world with Gods living among us,would have looked like.Because yes, it didn't have to be a perfect carbon copy of what we know about Egyptian mythology.

It is however a good back drop to tell tales and spin stories about a time and place that people know little about.This movie had a good special effects not only in the amazing sets and visual effects in general but I also found that the background sounds as well that really helped to sell the story line.Speaking of the story line I thought they did well with how it unfolded and how it showed the growth of the characters both mortal and immortal alike.

Most other negative reviews point out the rampant CGI and ""silly"" story.For my own part, yes, I do think more authentic casting would have benefited the movie. I am not politically upset by whitewashing. I just think it damages the quality of the film. Even though the setting is heavily stylized and barely historical, the single element of the movie not reliant upon Egyptian motifs is the ethnicity of the leads, and it just feels like a cynical movie executive choice that is difficult to ignore. Just imagine a movie about Norse mythology where almost all of the actors are black or Asian. It wouldn't be politically significant. It just wouldn't feel right, and that's the weird out-of-place feeling we get while watching Gods of Egypt. As for the CGI and story, I thought both were perfectly adequate. The movie reminds me of Stephen Sommers' Mummy and Van Helsing series, and it's just the kind of fantasy/sci-fi movie we haven't seen very often since Marvel and DC have pretty much taken over that niche with comic movies. Gods of Egypt is old fashioned adventure movie, and that simply does not appeal to everyone these days. I gave it a 7 because I found it to be entertaining and interesting (I love mythology), but I deducted 1.5 points for the inauthentic casting, and I deducted another 1.5 points because I prefer my historical / fantasy media to be R-rated in the tradition of 300 and Spartacus, and Gods of Egypt definitely plays it too safe in the sex and violence department.",Gods of Egypt

I can't count how many Odisseus and Troy films have been made to these days, Clash of the Titans and so on. Being faithful to a mythological story is sometimes tricky when you want to make a good movie without being ridiculous but, nowadays, audience is more used to fantasy movies and fantastic stories so producer, writers and directors can be more bold. Maybe that's the fault, maybe a story based on a mythology (which means old funny religion) is a good ground for a stunning, eye candy, nonsense movie. The many discrepancies and anachronisms are often too much to allow this film to be called Gods of Egypt. The gods hierarchy is messed, the earth is depicted as flat (really??) while we know perfectly that Egyptians were perfectly aware of the roundness of our planet. and (once again after Stargate) gods (RAH) looks more like aliens (not that crap again) than deities.

(for instance Geoffry rush looks more like he's dressing up as a Chinese person with a long kong fu braid than an Egyptian- but he does a really good job, so you kind of chuckle/ roll your eyes the first second you see him, but 2 seconds later his acting kicks in and you like him.)So to sum it all- if you're looking for a cute light film with great effects- go see this one.",Gods of Egypt

Do anything other than see this movie.,2,5 March 2016,"I'm going to keep this short because I don't want this movie to waste any more of your life than it has to.Garrish, oversaturated, blindingly horrendous CGI effects. It's so bad a cartoon would seem more realistic.Much of the acting is less than stellar with wooden delivery at times. The story is tired, cliché, boring and predictable. It never feels as though there is anything at stake. The characters were poorly developed. Not only did I not feel any connection with them, I didn't WANT to have any connection with them.I loved some of Proyas' other films (Dark City, The Crow) and really wanted him to succeed. It was only out of support for him I went to go see this film and had extremely low expectations given the negative reviews. Unfortunately, after seeing it, many of these negative reviews gave him way too much credit. It's obviously not the worst movie ever made, but it's so difficult to sit through I don't care about the difference.",Gods of Egypt

I mean forget about the unknown cast but the story is so uninteresting that i fell asleep during the anti-climatic battle and had to rewind to see what happened. Gerard butler the biggest star in the movie couldn't even salvage it as he was hardly in the movie and though he is supposed to be an Egyptian god and he could hardly let go of his Scottish accent. The acting was bad, the script was poor, the action kinda sucked and it was really uninspiring.

The script sounds as if it was written for a high school drama class (by one of the students), and some of the actors (Thoth) appear equally qualified.You can tell the producers are big believers in effects, as you could probably count on one hand the number of scenes that weren't green screen or cgi. As is usually the case with this type of production, the effects became the story rather than serving to help tell a story.George Clooney keeps a poster of his Batman movie up in his house as a cautionary tale to what can happen when you pick bad scripts. I can only imagine the leads in this film, all accomplished and capable actors, have a ""Gods of Egypt"" poster similarly hanging in their home offices.If you never watch this movie, you've missed nothing.",Gods of Egypt

Do you think Egypt really looked like that in those days? This is a fairy tale. Not real life. Just like the tales of the bible. Sit down and enjoy a movie once in a while.

Well no don't bother they all are the same!!! Well mythology is not but movies are its similar to Clash of the titans but i am not going to comment that and compare with this! OK so how should i describe this movie? There is a sentence:,,Overly confident and CGI''. Yes, so there's that but i don't want to spoil it because some people want to watch it! Good but movie doesn't have some point and its pretty linear as movie can get! Well in some movies you would probably wonder what would happen if... Here?! NO! Don't even bother! See this movie follows ,,mythology'' but you just may go back in time to your history class in fifth grade! After this movie you will scratch you head and ask yourself how much this movie costs... But don't ask yourself that because human spirit is so so strong! Like when you want to accomplish something and you are doing well to make masterpiece, sorry i don't want to waste your time... Well you really need to be concentrated for this if you lose track you will begging movie to be over even at the half time! You will begging anyhow! If you like this kind of movies that is fine with you... One thing to mention where movie fails so hard! Movie doesn't know what it wants to be!!!(pleas understand this, it isn't like i don't know what to say, here its true) You should read books rather than watching this! What could improve this move! Less CGI sure and unnecessary characters(mercenaries) overly sensitive characters and overly confident and script(God please)! Well since there are problems like this we are stuck with move as it is now! Feels like Jupiter ascending(i can't say which one is worst than the other) when that movie came out everybody were like:,,Cool, it will be awesome and best thing ever'' but what came from that is bucked full of tears and salt water and what ever do you want... I watched this movie today with my friends and teacher(probably the awesome-st guy that i know) and they were like: ,,movie is awesome'' And i was like people get really what is good about this movie that pumped you so much and they were like brain washed!!! I watched obviously more movies then them and they are brain washed that is all! So here it is watch if you like this kind of movies!

As opposed to other ""epics"". It's silly, and totally not worth the budget it was made with (meaning it would have been cheaper but probably retain the same spectator value). Perhaps make the dialogue even funnier, that would have worked too. The acting was pretty OK, same with CGI. The ways they tried to keep the difference in size is just laughable, but what can you do. I'd say it shows the mythology in a way that some people might actually retain at least a bit from. As opposed to what they teach in school - does anyone even remember that?

But watch able The landscape (both real and GCI) are beautiful and the gold is done very well. The characters could have done with a little fleshing out but not that bad. The writing does fall down flat mind - Isis committing suicide off screen is a bit much. It just smacks of lazy writing ( that no one has read about Isis and that no one had any idea of how she could be used) As well as missing out the Egyptian war gods (ok goddess : Neith and Menhit) yes Set does fall under that title but still it is a film about gods at war.On the positive this is one the best interpretation of Anubis and the afterlife ever done in film.Enjoy it for what it is Finally if you have any knowledge of the Egyptian myth then please try to leave it outside,Gods of Egypt

Actors with British accents adding more insult to injury of the already pathetic American acting. Nothing works in it, attempted jokes are falling dead on the ground, in Pirates o / t Car. you can do this but not in a movie about Egyptian myths and religion, unless you want to make a Leslie Nielsen spoof (G_D have your soul sir Nielsen , I love you ) I don't know much about Egyptian ancient religion and myths but this movie only adds more idiotic roles on G_D's.

Nothing about this movie is particularly good, but nothing is particularly bad either. The plot is easy enough for a 7-8 year old to understand, and the casting appears to be done to please the eyes of teen. The movie is honest in the way that it doesn't try to be anything more than a children's movie - which it is - and should therefore be watched as one.With that in mind it does a fairly good job of entertaining.

I believe this film has more of it than the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy combined. Not joking. I bet there's CGI in every single freaking scene of the movie! It really started to feel like my eyes were going to burn out of my sockets after almost an hour of watching it...and then getting a headache knowing I still had an hour more to sit through.The main character is an idiot and is also terribly bland. I think the only *kind of tolerable* character was Horus...even then I knew this movie was doomed. I just sat there tapping my fingers on my seat as the credits rolled by slowly.

After a while, we got pulled in the movie somehow and enjoyed watching it except some cliché love dialogues here and there.It's got what it takes for a movie, good acting, coherent scenario, no surprises with a good guys win ending.I am sure action lovers will definitely love this movie and others would enjoy it.

A movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and takes ample liberty with classic mythology; I'm not sure how much of a story would be there without the CGI effects, though. It's light fare, just there for entertainment. Don't expect a ""docu-drama"" or serious acting, and you'll enjoy it. I agree with the PG-13 rating; some of the violence and other imagery could scare young children. The sexual scenes are more implied than graphic, so no surprises there. The lack of diversity has been noted in other reviews; it brings to mind the old saying, ""Mighty white of you...!""And, in the end (spoiler alert!), Good triumphs over Evil; the world avoids Chaos; and True Love finds a way.

Butler is by far the stand out performance in this tale of Gods, Mortals and Chaos. He is his charismatic self and although it feels as though the rest of the cast struggle in delivering the lines, Butler adds some 'Earth' to the film. There is not a lot to say about the film itself. Very predictable, yet entertaining. Would I advise anyone to see it, yes I would.

314,krokoschilla,Don't watch it,1,10 May 2017,"I didn't like this movie. First off, this is a movie about Egyptian Gods. Notice the 'Egyptian'. I'm honestly not sure if there is any Egyptian actor except for an extra in this movie. Horus was played by a guy that could not look whiter if he tried, same with Bek.Then there's the matter with the story itself: Horus is sought out by Bek, who brings him one of his eyes back. On the way his girlfriend dies. He bargains with Horus to bring his girlfriend back and in return Horus gets his eye and he helps him find the other one. They then go on an 'epic' quest, with Horus belittling Bek at every turn. Their adventures are boring at best, laughable at worst. The only bright side is when we cut to Hathor (I think, the characters were kinda forgettable). She provides a few interesting moments. Once she meets up with our 'heroes' she joins them after saving their asses. Once they stop somewhere, she tells Bek that she can help him talk to his girlfriend and we see Bek's girlfriend. This plot line is equally as forgettable and boring as the primary one. THe girlfriend is just kinda there, not really doing anything, providing some motivation for Bek. After that we find out that Horus cannot actually bring the girlfriend back. This also kills any friendship between Horus and Bek. They were starting to like or at least respect each other. Hathor tells Bek that Horus lied and offers to give him her bracelet (apparently worth quite a lot) to give to his girlfriend so she can enter the Afterlife. THe bad guy, Seth (I think) decreed that only those with 'riches' can enter the Afterlife. Hathor's bracelet is more than a mere trinket since the bracelet is what keeps her safe from the demons she consorted with before Horus helped her (they were lovers). She takes it off and is taken by demons. Hathor's storyline is the only interesting thing about this entire movie, which is just sad. I would've liked to see it more developed, but what can you expect from a movie where Jaime Lannister plays Horus.Bek goes to visit his girlfriend and give her that bracelet. Then Seth or something is attacking the Afterlife. Again, the girlfriend fails to provide anything to the plot. I honestly don't remember another character as dull as her. Bek reenters the mortal world and they continue their 'epic' quest on the search for the eye. On the way they have to beat a sphinx (I forgot what for) and so they meet up with the god of wisdom. Horus 'manipulates' him so unsubtly I wanted to throw my phone at the TV. I know, the god of wisdom was supposed to be vain, but he does not deserve his title if he fell for that. They go to the Sphinx and the god of wisdom answers wrong. They nearly get killed. I was rooting for the sphinx. He answers the riddle right and they continue. Seth is currently meeting up with his wife/former wife. Then he cuts of her 'godly attributes' (wings). He does this with the other gods as well and melts their 'attributes' to himself. Then he goes to visit his father and kills him but he doesn't really kill him and it's all really confusing. Tbh, I was not rooting for Seth/his father/Horus/Bek, I was rooting for that demon slug his father (Horus' grandfather) had to fight every night. I was hoping it would demolish everything and no one would get out unscathed. They somehow manage to come back to the city and hatch some plan. They get help/threaten some wealthy guy into helping and while Horus climbs up the tower/(I think it's an obelisk?) Bek drives up the tower (inside) with the wealthy guy. The wealthy guy (surprise!) turns out to be a bad guy and tries to kill Bek. Bek survives and the wealthy guy doesn't (surprise.). Horus fights Seth and we discover he was actually capable of transforming into his godly form the whole time since his grandfather 'showed him how' but decided not to because he didn't believe his almighty grandfather. He defeats Seth and finds his other eye. Meanwhile, Bek has been injured and is dying. They try to make it seem like Horus and Bek have this ... 'epic bro-hood' and friendship, but it's flat and is not believable at all. Horus brings his fallen 'brother' to the pyramid where his girlfriend's already rotting and his grandfather visits him and the two corpses. He revives the two corpses. Happy End.The characters: Horus: Nothing Horus did seemed genuine. Horus looked constantly wasted or like he was coming down from a drug trip. Horus was not likable, he was an asshole even though he 'redeemed' himself, he was not likable. He had no charm, no interesting traits, nothing.Bek: Bek was made a lot worse by the actor. He seemed naive, forgave Horus for lying to him about his girlfriend and just generally being a asshole.The girlfriend: She was so forgettable that, I didn't remember her name. She added nothing to the story, had no real character. I don't think the movie would've lost anything if she hadn't been mentioned again after dying.Hathor: I think Hathor had the most well-developed character. You knew her motivations (staying alive, Horus) and she was badass in her own right without having to do actually fight.Seth: I'm not sure why he killed Horus' father. His motives didn't seem believable.The characters were not well developed, every character trait seemed exaggerated and sometimes they were too stupid to be taken seriously. Conclusion: I could've ignored the casting but the Characters kinda killed that attempt before it really started. I actually wanted to watch that movie in cinema and I'm so glad I didn't.",Gods of Egypt

Stop reading any reviews. See the trailer and go see the movie so you can judge it for yourself.

Effects are pretty good and suited the Egyptian vibe.There was a bit of cheese here and there and it is not a film with great depth, but the acting was pretty good.Not sure why it got such bad reviews, I can only suspect it was the political correct media who did not like the fact it had white actors playing all the main Gods (which some believe the ancient Egyptian elites were in fact Caucasian anyway, which is a debate) And also it may not pamper to the growing and irritating Femiwood thing, as it was strong men leading the roles, and with effeminate women, a little traditional in that sense. So it would not surprise me if all this was the true motivation behind its poor media reaction, which is a shame.

Spoiler alert: There is a scene where the young chap's girlfriend gets whisked away in a chariot and she's standing there in what is obviously a fake chariot with a green screen behind her, and she is standing there like she is at a cocktail gathering.

I enjoyed the whole adventure from beginning to the end, without any boredom. The movie's plot and story is light, but Fun, like watching a Disney's fairy tale cartoon. It is a family friendly fairy tale (mythology) movie.

I'm sad, this genre is usually my favourite ... you know something to lose yourself in of an evening. An event where you leave the theatre ""glamoured"" by the sheer spectacle of seeing such wondrous sets and excitement. Alas not for me, it was a joy to watch but would have been so much better with the sound off and radio four on instead. Honestly, the script is so tragic with all the subtle nuances of Dora the Explorer. Imagine Thor with a screenplay written by Enid Blyton ... getting the idea? It'seems the script, it is truly insulting.See it at your peril, remember, you can give your time easily but you won't get your 2hrs 7mins back.

All that I knew about Ancient Egypt and its gods was from a TV animated series called ""Adventures of Papyrus"". I loved that show as a kid and that's why I decided to give this take on Egyptian mythology a go.I'm glad I did.As mention earlier, I was concerned that I want get much of why this guy looks like that or who is this god again? But the movie, being targeted at the general public that has no idea who these guys are, and knowing it, took it's time to introduce as to the workings of that universe and all the characters and did it flawlessly without taking us away from the story.The things I liked- the visuals and landscapes. Some people here say the cgi sucks. Don't listen to them! It's done right. The acting was superb, especially Gerald Buttler's performance as the movie's baddie. The other actors did not disappoint as well. The story itself was pretty decent, too. Going in to watch a fantasy movie/hero's quest is what I can describe it as.What I sort of disliked- as I point out in the title- it started off slow. You really need to be patient with this movie. The first half an hour or so, as not as strong as the rest of the movie. I was really doubting if I will like it at all, but I decided to continue watching. Well, it kept getting better and better as time went by.So to recap, if you like fairy tales, fantasy movies with sword fights, heroes on a quest/journey to fulfill their destiny and these kind of stories- you will enjoy this movie no doubt!",Gods of Egypt

Guess what, they're not speaking Coptic either! Gasp! (yes, I had to google what the closest live language to ancient Egyptian was >_<).I do believe it is understood that this story is an adaptation of ancient Egyptian beliefs and characters (gods and goddesses, afterlife, etc). So yes, they pick and choose what parts they want in a (very) westernized tale... And I did think that they did a good job. For the ancient Egyptians, the gods did walk amongst the living. The king was supposed to be the living embodiment of the god Horus. So the storyline is not really that far-fetched. As for the acting, most of the cast is pretty good. Horus was a slight let down. It's as if they wanted Aaron Eckhart, but had to make do with this guy. (Gerard Butler and Aaron Eckhart are in London Has Fallen). And the girl playing Zaya. I guess that was her character? to be ""sweet"" and steadfast in loyalty, both to her husband and to her God. Still, every time she came on screen, I thought the ancient Egyptians had great push-up technology. Seth and Hathor were great (Gerard Butler and Elodie Yung). Geoffrey Rush does justice to his role (as always). Brenton Thwaite (the mortal/the thief) wasn't so bad either.It's a sweet story overall. And entertaining! Lovely CGI on top of it. I enjoyed it :). I wouldn't recommend it to scholars of ancient Egypt. But even they would appreciate the nod to mythological characters in this fiction piece :D.Disclaimer: I left pretty much the exact same review on rottentomatoes.

331,cthulufunk,Deserves at least a 7 for its boldness.,9,15 August 2021,"I enjoyed Gods of Egypt.Was the CGI bad? Sometimes. Did I care? Not really.I'm not enough of an expert to say if it does Egyptian mythology entirely right, but I know they got many things right, like Ra dragging the Sun in his chariot, the scales for weighing hearts in the afterlife, Set's murder of Osiris, etc. Things like this it got right, the plot is what deviates from Egyptian mythology.The usual ""woke"" social justice warriors whined a lot about the mostly white cast (you'll see some in reviews here) but there are some POC actors in the movie, like Chadwick Boseman as Thoth (best thing in the movie, he was flamboyant & refined R. I. P.) Yaya Deng as Astarte & Elodie Young as Hathor. There were production limitations that prevented Egyptian actors being cast, such as a lack of English speaking Egyptian actors, studio pressure for box office draws that'd been in fantasy blockbusters (Gerard Butler from 300, Coster-Waldau from GoT) & Australian Film Board requirements that most the cast & crew be Aussies. So shut up, it's a fantasy movie about gods, not a documentary.The production design is awesome. Great creature designs, awesome costumes reminiscent of Stargate, gold gold GOLD everywhere, it's a beautiful unique movie with lots of flair & originality, fantastical set pieces. And a solid cast that sells the story even though they're likely usually on a green-screen set.I would give it a 7 because sometimes it looks like a videogame & there's some narrative issues. But I'm giving it a 9 to offset all the unfair reviews. It's something you rarely see nowadays, a big budget movie that's daring & takes chances. I'd compare it to another maligned movie I liked that also took a myth & did something daring by upping the fantasy elements, Darren Aranofsky's 'Noah'. Gods of Egypt however is more of a colorful romp than the much darker Noah. Both are larger than life films & worth a viewing.",Gods of Egypt
332,chrisproggram,The legend of Zep Tepi,7,14 May 2018,"I've just watched recently on Blu Ray Gods Of Egypt, it was a very enjoyable ride.
If the production were using more sets construct it could it been an epic, but that i leave it to the filmmakers.
The story is part accurate part fable.It is the time of Zep Tepi (The Fist Time) when the Ancient Gods ruled over men, and how they found them self's in troubles,and struggle by learning their mistake they have learned their lessen through the human beings.
The story folows based on the true myth of the Ancient Egyptian Gods, how Osiris was appointed ruler of Ancent Khemet with his sister Isis. It is the truth myth of the Pre-History of the Antediluvian world. aprox 10,000 - 12,000 BC when Atlantis was swallowe beneath the waves in the Atlantic Ocean.This is the missing pages of our forgotten history mind you.Is it hidden or a myths?
Set kills Osiris then cuts his body into pieces, and spreads them across Ancient Khemet Empire, Only one piece survives and that is the phallus of Osiris.Hiis loyal subject finds it and hands over to Isis the Queen of the Gods, She uses it and gets impregnated and she bores Horus, that set to be the ruler of the throne of Khemet. Horus grows and become mighty warrior that go into battle with Vimanas against Set and fight in a mighty battle he is hit with a laser bear from the ship of set and dropes down. He is badly injured he heals then he goes on a journey to the hidding place of Set and kills him at Mount Sinai. At the same time Isis is set on the quest to find every piece and to resurrect her beloved husband Osiris. It is the Quest of Immortality.This is the true myth.The move should be made that way but because of sexual contents depraved from the story Alex Proyas uses the corner stone of the myth and changes the elements of the story to develop that led to a different interpretation of the Zep Tepi.
A lot of people don't understand the concept of myths that is the history of bygone age of the real quest to immortality and their struggle with their ruling over men. That is the true history of the Gods.
I like one particular element that is straight from Zacharia Sitchin pages, The Gods were angry at all times and thirst for vengeance, they didn't have emotions. and that is their fall. Only humans have those emotions that make us different and better then the Gods.
In fact the Truth myth is Amon-Ra is not the father of Osiris and Set instead is Atlas the last king of Atlantis. Ancent Khemet is in fact the Osirian Empire that stretches through out the whole Mediterranean Basin, Lybia and Egypt it was a colony of the Atlantian Empire.The madeteranin Basin at hat time bas a valley tith lakes and rivers that is now submurged. King Atlas and the Queen Mu gave authority to Osiris to rule Ancent Khemet, but his brother Set been subjugated by the dark side fell short and become a jealous Prince that wanted to kill his elder brother Osiris. He wanted to be the ruler of Egyptian/Lybian Empire that was in parallels of the Atlantian Empire.In Ancent Khemet they used Vimanas that were fighting in mid air like the movie John Carter on Mars. Those elements should be incorporated into the story to make it an epic production it needed to be a cross between Thor and Lord of the Rings.
The move its self is better then Scorpion King in production and story and better interpenetration of the Gods as 9 foot giants then in the movie Immortals, that was lacking.
The Gods were 12 - 15 feet but that could it been outstanding or impossible to be made in comparison to the humans for the big picture.
The Ancient Gods from Egypt were in fact the Sumerian Gods Anunnakies that were 33 feet, then as they lived on out planet and of the gravitation force their life span dropped same as the height.
When you look at their family chart Osiris and Set fits with their third generation ruling Gods on our planet. the second been Amun and Amaunet .
Lot of critics complain about using to much white actor to interpret the Gods, they wrong, because the Ancent Gods were fair hair and white skin, the Anunnkies.
The Creation of their second class humans were the Dark skin or Bronze skin in Africa and those were the the mining class They used the proto-typed Proncozul the original earthly beings. Their first race was the Titans been the dark skin Giants, their second creation were the Cyclops and Spinx, Gryphons and other Monsters, then comes the Apes, right after their six generation they have had created the Humo-Humo Sapians the Adamites, been the same as their likenesses.
Lets created men in our image to be the same as our likeness.
The move it is fun to watch if you don't take it seriously. The SGI were cheaply made but some scenery were gorgeous. They showed the Earth or Shan been a Flat Star Ship not a sphere.probably that is how they've interpreted in those times, It might it been true. Everything that we know now is not new i fits the legacy of the Gods that we call it magic in fact it is their science and advance technology that we use a fragment in our society nowdays.Itas been lost or hidden in the course of time, ready to be discovered.
Only time will tell how we will interpret those myths or been our lost history that is stored in our subconsciousness in every humans, that needs to be revealed.The movie is very good It could it been an epic if they used more real sets construction and incorporated those elements above.
They have spend a lot of money on their costumes that were breathtaking and on the wizardly, not so much on the production sets.

As someone who reads folklore and mythology, I appreciated the unique approach to some of the concepts. The forced humor was misplaced but you can see that the film was paying homage to old-school sword and sandals like Hercules and Jason and the Argonauts. I adored 70s and 80s movies of that type.Elodie Yung shined here and Nikolai was clearly game for the odd role. I was surprised at how Brenton was somewhat wooden in his delivery and came off worst here than his turn in Pirates.

I've actually read all of these stories, and they are beautiful. What? The antithesis of what Hollywood is cranking out. I'm sure the cast had a roaring good time making this tripe, so good for them! Beaucoup bucks too, awesome! However, as I became almost instantly bored by the bad script, then the laughable representation of Horus, I knew I had a choice to make: 1) Continue watching and laugh my way through (like I did with the above mentioned movies, or; 2) turn it off lest watching more make my I.Q. drop 50 points, which no one can afford. Since I was watching it alone, I knew the latter would be my fate. The other two movies I saw with friends so they turned into raucously good times.

I'm 49 years old and still remember the old cowboy movies which cast Caucasian actors (painted down in makeup to make them 'appear' darker complected) in roles portraying Native Americans. Apparently some of those involved in the creative process have acknowledged how incredibly thoughtless it was to create a story, albeit a fantasy/adventure, centered around Egyptian people and the Egyptian gods cast almost entirely by white actors. I found the film and action exciting, honestly... There are some good actors involved in this project without a doubt. However, the way the movie was cast to pretty much entirely ignore the fact that Egypt is a country in Africa and that its peoples are African, ruined what could have been a good entertainment experience for me. I totally understand that movie-making is about entertainment and it doesn't necessarily have to be 100% 'accurate'... I mean look at the various 'historical' movies that are made, almost all of them take huge artistic license in accuracy to make 'a more exciting story'...

This movie looks and sounds great. The visuals are lovely, some of the music is great and acting is... alright... for the most part.The biggest issue i had with this movie was the romance between the main character Bek and his girlfriend Zaya. Zaya gets killed in the beginning of the movie and i didn't really care. Their romance had about 3-4 minutes of screen time beforehand so i didn't feel any connection to her. She was bland and uninteresting and didn't really have any character aside from ""Bek's girlfriend."" This makes it really hard to care about the story as a whole since most of it revolves around Bek trying to get her back from the dead, with the help of a couple gods.The acting is ranges from believable to reading lines without much emotion. I wasn't a fan of Set's acting at all. He was really underwhelming especially considering he was king Leonidas from 300. Zaya and Bek were largely generic and nothing special. The only characters i remember fondly are Horus, Thoth and that CGI goat, cow, thing.In short, a big disappointment. Looks and sounds lovely but with bland characters and a story only a mother would love this isn't something i'd recommend to anyone.

This is the type of movie that even a 15 year old could not stand to see. It is awful, full of CGI and no dialogue at all. I think the writers were drunk or something when they composed this ''masterpiece''. So you thing that the big stars would 'save' some of the movie but NO. In the whole movie their acting is below the average + their useless ''humor'' adds nothing to the childish scenario. I really hope that you didn't spend any money to the theaters to see it.

Long story short, I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The storyline was very well put together. A lot of thought went into this movie and that includes the 3D and special effects. I remember reading about the Gods when I was very young. My parents brought home books that told stories of Gods and Goddesses. So naturally, I was all hyped up about this movie. I can say with this is one of those guilty pleasures of a movie and I plan on watching again and again. I really enjoyed this movie. I am in hopes that this movie will have a sequel with the same level of intelligence, stamina, 3D and special effects to bring the characters to life on the big screen. I gave it an 8 because there were a few places where the story sort of got off track, but not a deal breaker in my book.

You can't require a popcorn movie to have any depth or inspire any deep thoughts. A popcorn movie is for people to have fun and enjoy themselves. I did not get all the white bashing thing. Egyptian are more like people in Middle East than African. Rami Malek is Egyptian descent. Does he look like African? Besides the god of Wisdom is a black actor.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is a great actor. He is fun to watch in this movie. The mistress of the west is great character too.

That said, this movie was good for me but I realize this movie may be an acquired taste and therefore, not up everyone's alley.If you keep the thought of Nephillim (google it) in the back of your head while watching, this movie is entertaining. I will agree with everyone else -- it's not at all historically accurate. It's a fantasy movie, it's not supposed to be realistic. So, if you're looking for an accurate representation, this movie isn't it. If you want to watch some creative plays on ancient themes, give this movie a chance. It's certainly different which is always a crap shoot in terms of guessing whether someone else will like it or not. I did but I'm into off the beaten path productions. If you like the occasional out there movie and don't walk into it with great expectations, this movie may be a good watch for you. I thought the characters and the bantering between them made this movie worth the watch. Contrary to many other reviews, I thought the height difference (you'll see) was perfect based on the historical assumption that they were 15 to 30 feet tall.

355,kevinl-23765,"Good potential, bad cast",6,27 February 2016,"I personally thought the movie was pretty good and has a lot of potential. It contains wild & thrilling actions that keeps audiences excited. It also has a pretty good ending and story structure. What led to so many critics? There are several reasons to that. 1. It is silly. Not all actors did a great job on their role. Many characters don't seem to be emotionally affected during intense scenes. For example, at a scene were the main character's girl friend died. He seemed sad at first, and seemed to fully recover 30 seconds later... It is just too dramatic for an action movie like this. There were some scenes, where they are trying to be funny; however, it backfires by making it more silly2. Bad scripts. The wording and the things said in this movie are weird. It just seems weird that in Egypt there is a silly man talking with British accent. The way they talk are too modern. It shows no Egypt culture at all. For example, in one scene; they used the term ""pirates"" & ""ions"". Those things didn't even exist back then. There are many more modern term used such as lettuce. It seems to that the characters are 21st century people with costumes on. 3. Bad character/costume choosing. Many actors did not fit well in the movie. Almost 90% of the gods in this movie are white people. No racism here! But they are suppose to be Egyptians; NOT Americans/British! The costume was also do not fit. Set, the fire god was dressed up like a Spartan in 300. Beck's girl friend was dressed up in a typical modern 21 century dress. The sun god Ra, was dressed up like a Pope. The god of knowledge was dressed in a Chinese style silk clothing. Silk didn't even exist back then! That just makes the movie even more silly!4. Plot with some flaws. There were some scenes or mircales that just happened without any previous explanations.5. Bad Special Effects. The special effect wasn't as bad as the movie ""Kingsmen"", but it isn't close to realistic. The special effects did show the 3D background. However, the lighting just seems weird and unreal. To me, it almost seemed like the stones were reflecting light. The only actor that did a great job was Gerard Butler. He was like the only serious character. I already expected that, since he did a great job on the movie 300 too. This film had a lot of potential, but was ruined by bad casting. Don't blame the director, he did a great job. If it wasn't for the bad casting, I thought it would have earned at least an 8/10 on IMDb.",Gods of Egypt

Did the writers even bother to open a book about Egyptian mythology, throwing in some random Egyptian gods' names does not make it about Egypt and completely undermines the rich vibrant Egyptian myths. Moreover, the set, the costumes and the actors do not give any kind of Egyptian characteristics to the movie, how is it any different from any Roman setting or any other ancient setting, it might as well have been called Gods of Mars. They did not even try to make the actors look remotely Egyptian-ish, it reminded me of the time John Wayne played Jenkis Khan.

359,claudebucher,Egypt?,2,21 May 2016,this has nothing to do with Egypt - just because a few (God) names are borrowed from Egypt doesn't make this an Egyptian story. The clothing may be remotely Roman but certainly not Egyptian. And the only way a son became Pharaoh was after his father's death. The behaviour of people (towards the Pharaoh) is maybe Hollywoodian but again has nothing to do with Egypt. The story in itself is a amalgam of unbelievable and unrealistic scenes whose sole purpose seems to be distraction rather then meaningful entertainment.

I wasn't as focused on whether or not the actors were white or not.I thought this film was good- although it missed the mark somewhere. I would not call it great.I am certainly no professor of English, so excuse my ignorance in attempting this review. I miss alot trying to interpret films or books.But I did notice that of the hundreds of reviews below, only one tried to mention what this film was about (The myth of Tep Zepi fused with Osiris/Isis myth). I found zero reviews mentioning metaphor. Maybe its a mistake to even try as nobody else seems to be.Anyway, to me it seemed like one of the key messages was that Horus, God of Air, is noted for keen vision. And if Horus is blind, watch out- because chaos and entropy and all sorts of demons lurk just beyond the realm of the known.I feel you could go deeper in analyzing, but not with my limited skill. So for me, it is a reasonable action film (that sometimes feels too video gamey), with some deep underlying messages, that we would do well to remember even today.An action flick, with a moral? How can you rate that as 5/10!?!",Gods of Egypt

The earth is shown flat as a pancake - Ra goes over the edge to go the ""flip side"". Thus this is not the Egypt we know in real life, but a fantasy one. Therefore all the hubbub about incorrect ethnic casting can be ignored.This fantasy world is consistently imagined. Sure the plots are nothing special and some of the action seemed to have been lifted from other films or even video games. And the CGI was glitchy sometimes (edge of wings). But it is overall visually satisfying and I found myself caring for some of the characters (e.g. Hathor).But I wished that they had shown that the body parts of the other gods survived the death of Set, and that the Architect found that his jewels were for nothing at the final gate since Horus changed the rules.",Gods of Egypt

It's completely not that. In all ways, this is a remarkably well-executed 'dumb' movie, in that it's a simple fantasy action epic that focuses on fun and escapism as its core. The critique of whitewashing would be a good critique of the film if it weren't so obviously a fantasy that has no concern with mimesis. Scottish accents? Fine, I don't care. Does he glower and seem like a bad guy in the classic bad guy sense? Sure does, so it works.Judging this film to see if it's historically or mythologically accurate is the wrong way to go about it because that's not what the film is trying to do. It's trying to be fun, give you a classic Hollywood fantasy story arc, and give you reasonably good effects and performances and let you just enjoy something for two hours. On that level, it works.Moreover, what it's really trying to is represent not Egypt as it was, but a version of how Egypt understood itself: not as a country on a globe or continent, but a narrow stripe of the 'world' with the life-giving Nile at core and the endless desert around it. Although this isn't true (the Egyptians clearly know about Greece and other areas), it's somewhat close to the vision they had (just as the Greeks thought they were the center of the world). If you approach the film generous to that idea, then you'll enjoy it as long as you enjoy the spectacle of the thing. If you approach it wanting reality and social justice in casting, you're critiquing via the wrong criteria.",Gods of Egypt

For those of us who are into cultural films, action, empowered women, and deities of ancient religion this movie is legit. I've watched it 4 times in the past 2 weeks. Hathor is definitely my favorite and I learned a lot about Egyptian folklore. The entire movie is nonstop and all of the characters are engaging and keep your attention. After the film I started reading up on Egyptian Gods/Goddesses and this particular tale is derived from actual Egyptian myth. Definitely worth a watch, a rent, or a buy because it doesn't look like it did well enough to stay long in theaters to at least hit par with its $150mill budget; however, come on guys n gals we all dig lookin' at Gerard Butler: muscles, leather garb, Scottish accent, and such since the movie The 300.

I digress. Regarding the movie...The special effects were neat enough to keep my kids (ages < 7) attention. However I found myself disinterested. I walked out the room to multitask during the apex battle of the movie; which should tell you something. They could've stop trying to remotely pull this poorly written plot together and cut 30 mins off the movie. It felt like someone read a couple paragraphs regarding Egyptian history on Wikipedia, then just took off with their own interpretation.

The shop keep notices, the thief runs, guards chase after... immediate cut he's talking to a girl now.Yep, no fun chase scene, even if that's screen writing, like, 85, remedial screen writing for a 9 year old.

None of the actors give a sh*t about anything they're doing, and since they only did one take each time why should they! The editor did the whole movie in a single pass while blindfolded.

Before I realize, I'll be zapping between tv stations, do something else on my pc or turn off the dvd. (I don't go to cinema's much.)This movie held me in my seat watching.
It a has a modern day make-over to a classic old epic movie from back in the day.
I loved all the color representing good times, while the bad times are mostly less bathed in bright colors.
As for the gods being bigger than mortals, nice touch!, but I do feel that these ancient and almighty gods could have had some more godly powers, I mean what god would walk the desert if he is able to ""think"" himself to his destination...., after all they created everything.The story was quite entertaining, the plot was somewhat predictable but it did have some unexpected and pleasant twists.
CGI wasn't mindblowing but it fitted in nicely enough to not be annoyingly present. (Meaning bad)My conclusion, not a masterpiece but not as bad as critics claim it to be.
Despite my ADD I watched it a couple of times now and not once did ai feel bored or felt the need to turn it off.

So I did, and I was pleasantly surprised. First of all: YES THE EGYPTIANS IN THIS MOVIE ARE MOSTLY WHITE. Some of them are also about 12 feet tall and can transform into flying robots. If historical accuracy is what you're looking for, this is not the movie for you, but I don't feel that this detracts from the story or the characters or the amazing visuals and had no effect on my overall enjoyment of the film. I've heard people complain about how its not original or the plot sucks or the script sucks, and maybe this is only because I went in with such low expectations, but I actually found the story pleasant and enjoyable (albeit not very complicated, but that's not necessarily bad), and some of the lines were legitimately funny. Not to mention this is one of those rare movies that isn't based off a book or is a sequel/remake (not that those are necessarily bad either), so the originality argument doesn't make that much sense either. Now, obviously it wasn't a fantastic movie - it was pretty heavy with clichés, some of the dialogue did fall flat, a few deus ex machina moments, and the CGI didn't always hold up - but for what it Set out to do (be a fun, action packed, cool-looking movie to not think very hard about) it did a good job. Better than it needed to in fact, because I usually can't stand the main characters in those types of movies but Horus and that mortal guy were actually pretty likable.

That wasn't entertained for me. I didn't expect this unrealistic fight to happen like that, they would have made it better than what they did.Overall, the movie is entertained and you won't get bored while watching it, the actions happen fast which is good for a fantasy movie like this.I think they will release God of Egypt II to continue the story with other Gods of Egypt after ""Horus"", that would be great.",Gods of Egypt

Set was an intimidating and ruthless villain murdering his way across the world to impose his will upon it, and only Horus has the power to stop him.

The mediocre CGI transformations. However the setting of the movie is beautiful and visually impressive. The story is very straight forward Good Vs Evil which is throwback to years when movie plots were less complicated. The movie held my undivided attention throughout the run time and the acting was surprisingly well done. All in all I absolutely love this movie.

I will not go into details.. it's pointless. If I could choose again, I would not go again although I am a fan of comics-like, CGI rich movies..

393,i_s_a_89,With a bit more effort it could have been decent,3,7 June 2016,"As the opening scenes began, I could not help but sneer at the prospect of the calamity I assumed this film would be from what the trailer left to interpretation. And indeed with the musical score, I could not help but wonder if Gods of Egypt was meant to be an epic disaster of biblical proportions meant to amuse the greats of cinema in the afterlife...But at the end of it, I could not help pondering if this could have not been done better with a bit more effort. No, not money - enough was thrown at it - probably a lot to have Gerald Butler to do his usual business of grunting and flexing his biceps and swinging some weapon, no doubt; certainly a substantial part of the budget must have gone to Victoria's Secret to scantily, but tastefully, clad the goddesses on the screen and of course the most impressive chunk (and here we can see a job well done) on the beautification and the glitz that at the end of the movie is meant to seductively lure us under the impression that it was worth spending our budget on the movie ticket rather than on a bigger flower bouquet for mum. Certainly, a humble amount of the film's budget must have been handed over to a poor conservatory student, probably in a back alley transaction, who at the last minute presumably copy-pasted together music from proper epics. Honestly, the score was so severely mismatched at times with the events going on, one had to be left wondering if this film was not meant as a parody. And no expense must have been spared for the poor script.Alas, the only impressive element of the film remain its visuals. Every single scene, the viewers can expect to feast their eyes on the glittering images of a mythical Egypt, they can maybe feel themselves transposed to those beautifully rendered astral plains and to the vast bleakness of the underworld. The visuals helped convey the mood of a place or of a scene far better than the clearly placid effort of all the eye candy on set. Not meant to be disrespectful, but either for lack of better judgment, or sheer laziness, none of the actors seemed to do more than recite their lines as if in a school play written by the 2nd graders. Maybe they were hoping the CGI would mask their shortcomings? No, the greatest problem was not the acting - nobody would expect Shakespeare to pour into our ear from such a film, but the dialogue was simply atrociously puerile - hence my comparison to a school play. There were clear attempts at humor and grandeur alike - none of which can impress the adult audience Gods of Egypt was meant for. I mean, a few more polysyllabic words could not have hurt.It was somewhat captivating, but this was not owed to good storytelling, as much as to seductive visuals. With a proper script, I am certain it would not have been slashed by critics. Had it been made into an animation and intended for a young audience, the producers could have even gotten away with the dialogue and the dull tale. The premise of the film was intriguing enough and there was obviously some didactic purpose to it, but there was not much to go on and the execution was lacking in several aspects. As an animation, it might have even been good and very welcome. But since this is not the case, this film has succeeded only in following along the line of numerous other blockbusters which give the critics pen fodder, which entertain us and remove us for their two hours from our dreary existence and once the experience is over, it's time to move on with business as usual. Gods of Egypt will leave no durable impression on viewers or on cinema in general and it will be forgotten along with all films of its kind.All in all, it took itself too seriously when it was supposed to laugh at itself and was too self- deprecating when it should have been serious. Not recommended for cinephiles, for those looking for depth in films or simply for fans of good acting. But if you enjoy escapism or just take a kick out of seeing Gerard Butler grunt and flex, go ahead, you will not be (that) sorry. Oh, and there was a love story in there somewhere... it probably meant to be a star-crossed lovers type of deal, but it was just as uninspired as the rest. Have a nice viewing!",Gods of Egypt

The screenplay must have been written by a 12 year old kid.The battle scenes were extremely disappointing. These allegedly redoubtable ""Gods"" are supposed to have awe inspiring powers, yet they seem to die very easily, and hardly put up a fight... What's more, there's next to zero creativity in the fight sequences. This movie will be as quickly forgotten as all those names of your friend's friends at a party.There was potential!

395,oyugik,Lavish Visual Effects Salvage this Film,8,21 April 2016,"The Alex Proyas fantasy film 'Gods of Egypt', which for the first time in a while vilifies the Award-winning actor Gerard Butler as the Egyptian god of War, Set, also elevates seasoned actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (you may recognize him for his role as Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones).Set in the mythological world of a bountiful Egypt, a place christened as 'heaven on Earth' where the gods have decided to settle among the human race and rule over it, Osiris is handing over his crown and throne to his son Horus (played by Nikolaj), at a profligate ceremony that sees Egyptians from all over the realm come to pay homage and celebrate the millennium of peace they have graciously enjoyed under the incumbent.The god of War, Set, who happens to be Osiris' brother, comes to spoil the party for his nephew however, as he forcefully takes over the reigns in what would soon prove to become a blood-thirsty selfish onslaught for power and dominance. We swiftly discover that while the gods may live far longer than humans, there is some mortality to their existence, as they bleed gold amidst their shape- shifting capabilities. Known as 'beast mode', Set and Horus transform in a cataclysmic duel that leaves Set victorious and Horus banished sightless.The true champions of the epic fantasy however, amidst all the majesty of a surfeit of powerful beings, happen to be the couple Bek and Zaya (played by Brenton Thwaites and Courtney Eaton respectively). Their love, which literally knows no boundaries, pushes men and gods alike to jettison all fear and restraint, in a battle to save the realms of both beings from total chaos.An unlikely pair of Horus (light) and Bek end up journeying through the fantastic world of Egypt, and the realm of the 'creator', the god Ra, as they seek to get back Horus' abilities, as well as his self-worth and belief, in order to mount up a challenge against the increasingly insurmountable Set, who usurps the powers of other gods in his quest for supremacy.While the film may have, and continue to, receive a lot of flak for its lack of casting diversity, which pundits have declared is partly the source of its globally lackluster performance at the Box Office, one cannot take away from it the epic yet sternly successful proportions to which the producers and directors have gone to further the obsession with Egypt and its archaeological and mythological history to produce a stunning film.'Gods of Egypt' may be laden with a weak script, but it will take you on a pleasurable journey into the majesty envisioned of Egyptian deities, breathtaking landscapes and a plunge into how high (Set's tower not withstanding) the stakes are in the age-old battle of light versus darkness.",Gods of Egypt

397,DragonPharao,another stupidity and offense,1,22 May 2016,"well how many times have we Egyptians have to suffer the stupidity and idiotic handling of our history by Hollywood. Firstly: the cast itself is a disaster: blonde blue eyes gods of the country that is not just a part of Africa, but racially speaking was also populated by Africans (some Theories even suggest Egyptians are the ancestors of all Africans). moreover the horrible costumes and acting of the small characters: seriously do the idiots who made this movie thought Egyptians since the dawn of time used to wear these absurd clothes? the decor is horrible and the camera is trying to hide it sometimes and some other times that stupid director thinks his computer generated decorations are worth it so he shows it in details. the plot is so stupid and ridiculous it almost is annoying. it is mostly so boring that you would regret watching the movie, with all the irrational twists, the scenes which emerge with no introduction and characters coming and going with no actual purpose but cheap action. i could go on and on with the cheesy lines, the stupid acting by every main character but again i must assert the main point: this movie is so offensive to me as an Egyptian that i was really furious when it ended. it is one thing to use our history stupidly but it is totally another level of insult to maim and tarnish it. the scene that insulted me the most is the one coming after one hour and 28 minutes: where the dead are stepping to be judged by disfigured and horrendous mommies: the scene shows that you offer something in a scale which is the measure upon which you are evaluated,if your offering is rich and valuable your you pass to eternal life in what seems to be heaven,while poor people with poor offerings are sucked into hell literally. well. here is why this so insulting: one of the very dear and honorable things we Egyptians remember of our ancestors is the moral and highly sophisticated way they dealt with life and afterlife. Old Egyptians thought Auzir - the God of Life awaits the dead in the afterlife with a scale of two parts: in one lies the Feather of Justices - the true measure of Honor and truth, and the other scale is for the heart of dead man or woman - the heart holds your deeds and thoughts. and the measure is easy: if your heart is filled with good deeds and intentions you have tipped the scale in your favor and you pass to live in the paradise of afterlife with no worries or burdens. if not, your hear t is thrown to a beast that awaits near the scale to eat it and you literally Die Forever in hell. the Director and the two writers did not just make a horrible movie but a very insulting one as well. shortly: the movie is below Zero, if IMDb would allow it the movie should be labelled culturally insulting and Racially offensive.",Gods of Egypt

This film already stole 2 hours of my life that I'm never getting back, therefore this review is not going to be particularly long.First- The CGI us atrocious. So many special effects are laughably bad. My favorite is when Bek is trying to get where the gold is stored and swing from a rope into the bin that has all the gold. (You'll know it when you see it) Also the fact that Gerard Butler and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau turn into mecha gods that battle each other. This literally good be a prequel to the transformer films. There's also the god of wrath who pumps himself up to gigantic size. Speaking of size it's jarring that the gods are larger than humans. It worked for films like Lord of the Rings, but here it is just awkward. The action goes from frantic jump cuts to over use of slowmo in seconds.Second- The script is weak and riddled with clichés. Any problem the characters get in is easily fixed by movie magic. There are no rules for the characters in this world. They can go anywhere and do anything that gets them to the end of the movie. Also the amount of cheese is strong in the dialogue. Not a single joke landed for me.Lastly- The only character that is slightly entertaining is Chadwick Boseman. He's in the movie just a little bit shorter than Gerard Butler. Whoever is Gerard Butler's agent needs to be fired. Every other character in this film is just going through the motions. That's not even mention the fact that the cast is predominately white in a film set in Egypt.Please don't waste your precious time on this awful movie.

399,ggtillery-181-746945,Less would definitely be more,5,5 March 2016,"Some day the people who finance movies like this will learn that more-more-more is not necessarily the best philosophy--even for spectacles. Eight or ten fight scenes or harrowing escapes would be plenty. After that, the viewer's mind begins to numb.The first 20-30 minutes were fine, to me, although the characters could have used more development. You can almost imagine the director saying, ""We need to get through this stuff so the CGI guys can take over. That's what they want to see!"" Even after the story is launched, the interludes where we get to learn more about the characters were too brief. Bek was an entertaining, Ulysses-like character with some great lines, and Zaya was endearing and a feast for the eyes. They might have saved the film with more time on-screen. But no, they disappeared in a headlong rush of CGI-driven scenes where there's no real feeling of peril, just raging gods and goddesses, collapsing buildings, strange creatures slithering around, and Geoffrey Rush imagining what he's going to do to his agent after he gets off work.Don't get me wrong. I know it's a fantasy movie, and it is imaginary gods we're talking about.

405,korcsmarosandras,It's an entertaining FANTASY film!,8,25 February 2016,"Sadly, I knew people would dislike the movie, ever since the first trailer popped in, and it got all the negative comments. First of all, about this ""white washing"": ancient Egyptians were not black. Not white either, but not black. And does it really a problem? Did the performance of Laurence Olivier as Othello (a character who IS black) bothers anyone? No. The director of Gods of Egypt is Alex Proyas, who was born in Egypt. I guess he was well aware of his country's history when he made the casting choices. And he has the right to choose anyone he wants. He is the director. Not the director of a documentary or a drama that's based on a true story. He is the director of a fantasy movie. Yes, the mythology has been around for thousands of years, but it's still a fantasy movie where Horus and other gods exist. None of this happened, so no one should look for historic accuracy. Let's move on. I felt this movie is like Clash of Titans or Prince of Persia. It's not flawless. It's absolutely forgettable. It's 15 minutes longer than it should be. The CGI (when Horus and Seth transformed) is cartoonish. BUT: It's entertaining! The production design and the cinematography is great! I've always loved the Egyptian myth, and I was glad to see this movie's world was creative and visually great to look at. The music is solid. I liked the actors and their characters. For me, Chadwick Boseman had the best part in the movie. Minor role, but I loved every second of it. And I liked that neither of the main heroes is a comic relief. Yes, the script was not the best, but I've seen some blockbusters in the past one year (like Mad Max: Fury Road, Furious 7, etc.) that were loved by critics and viewers but had no superior script.Once again, GODS OF Egypt is not for everyone, but it is for some.

410,rubenbeugelink,Not just Awful. It's God Awful!,2,1 March 2016,"Gods of Egypt is awful in almost every way! This movie is directed by Alex Proyas who made movies such as Dark City and the Crow. Crazy right? But what's really weird is that this guy is from Egypt. Yet he thought i'd be a good idea to make a movie set in Egypt without any Egypt people in it... But I'm not gonna talk about the race issue because that's like beating a dead horse.Performances: The acting was God awful. Bek (played by Brenton Thawaites) feels like a sitcom character. He makes a lot of jokes and they all feel so forced and unrealistic. His character is incredibly annoying and would be better of dead. Horus (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) was fine. Just like all the other characters in this movie, his jokes feel forced and unrealistic. But his performance was just okay. And Set (Gerard Butler) is here just to do some 300 impressions. Nothing special. There is this one guy Thoth (played by Chadwick Boseman) who also gave a terrible performance. I really hope this is because of the director because he'll be playing Black Panther! i really hope that won't flop.Plot: Yeah. What is the plot? I don't even know anymore. Something involving a guy whose girlfriend died, then he met a god. gods fight each other. Some useless big monsters (giant snakes and stupid space snake). After a CG filled journey they got trapped by Set. Set gets killed because for some reason ''love'' is the secret to become a god. Movie ends.CG: Oh my god. It was awful. The first fight scene look pretty cool, 2 flying objects fighting each other. But after that it went to sh**. There are some slow motion fight scenes but it's really hard to look at. The green screen is off. The jungle the walk in looks incredibly fake. The different scales between human and god look laughable. The old guy in flames looks like a 2000's movie. Normally I wouldn't be so harsh on bad CG but this movie has a 140.000.000 budget. Come on guys!In the end I think this is one of the worst,m most painful movie I've every watched. The only reason it gets a 3 instead of a 1 is because the first fight scene wasn't that bad. And the CG of the flying gods isn't the worst thing ever. Just. Don't see this movie!Ps.

411,kurtatran,Definitely a watch for real fans of action fantasy,10,28 February 2016,"So there were apparently a ton of critics looking for a home-run in terms of plot and character development. That's a lot to expect from a 2 hour action movie seeking to tell an entire story. Though I sound like I'm saying it's bad in these aspects, I thought they did a great job of explaining the characters and creating a clearly understandable story. It's not as there is a narrator walking you through the events. If you pay attention to the actual depiction of the story rather than something ridiculous such as an actor's accent in a story where gods roam the Earth, all the events will be clear to you. Somehow, critics have the magical power to ignore what an author portrays by trying to nit-pick all the clichés and tiny inconsistencies. If you become immersed within this movie and accept what might be normally odd in the modern world, the story will transcend being simply a cgi thriller. The cgi is in fact extraordinarily well-done, but the purpose is to make this impossible world come to life. The characters portrayed their roles excellently. There were only 2 parts which were rather silly, but after each of these events was a scene that was rather reconciling. The fight scenes also don't look like mindless exchanges of punches, stabs, and pointless movement, but was rather well choreographed and you could trace each action. Both the beginning and ending were great, and I left feeling thoroughly satisfied. Even my mother who normally despises action movies felt that it was terrific.",Gods of Egypt

When Horus grew up he struggled for his throne, he killed his uncle, lost one eye , and won the throne. This Americana version of the story is very poor. 2- Cinematography was truly funny, gods height was ridiculous. this variance of height between gods and humans affected much on the scenes joining both specially drama scenes. 3- There are many ridiculous visualizations of ancient Egypt, and the worst visualization prize goes to Set's high tower.

The flat earth part in the movie, is indeed very accurate and true. Also the ''Gods'' or aliens at the time, might have been white. Either way, there were multiple races in that period, and this movie portrays them very well. The battles and costumes are not exaggerated, many legends speak of several battles between alien races, their outfit and armament fit the description as well.

The plot gives the viewer the gist of the Horus vs. Set myth, while still differing enough to offer surprises to people who are familiar with Egyptian mythology. To some degree, the path that one of the main characters follows (to avoid spoilers the character will remain nameless) is a bit predictable, but that doesn't make it bad!Now, of course, we come to the racial controversy. I need to take a point off for some questionable casting roles. The reasons I don't take off more points are a) we don't know what color Ancient Egyptians were, and b) there was diversity, even if there should have been more. Ancient Egyptian art depicts people with varying skin tones, some light, so it would be difficult to narrow down one particular skin tone and say that this is what the actors should be. The main cast is composed of Scottish, Danish, Australian, Cambodian/French, and African American actors. Overall, there should have been more diversity though, because the bulk of actors are Australian. Which, in no way is bad, it's just that Australians tend to have light skin and, while some Ancient Egyptians may have had lighter skin than people think, the hieroglyphics depict it darker than most of the actors. Even though we can't be sure what skin tone Ancient Egyptians had, the cast should have at least included more people with African descent, given that Egypt is in Africa. If we can't narrow down a skin tone, we can at least be sure of country of origin.All of the actors did a decent job playing his/her respective character, but I have to say that some choices seemed odd. Geoffery Rush is an amazing actor and he will forever be the one of the best pirates I've ever seen on screen. He wasn't as memorable as the sun god, though. For Ra (and maybe I'm a bit biased, being a fan of classic lit.), I'd expect someone to ooze majesticness. Rush's performance seems a bit more surly. I mean, hey given what he has to do every day, I could see a bit battle-worn. But I never get the feeling of awe I'd expect from the head honcho of the gods. Gerard Butler makes a very attractive and powerful Set and I feel bad about discounting him on something he can't control. However, his Scottishness made the choice of him as Set seem a bit odd. Hearing a Scottish accent in the voice of an Egyptian god causes a bit of confusion. Honestly, I would have chosen different actors to play them. I can't narrow down one for Ra, but Peter Mensah would have made a great Set. Anyway, I loved the movie and was extremely entertained even if I disagreed with some of the casting choices.",Gods of Egypt
416,James_Johnson79,A vibrant fantasy movie with a bold style that was misunderstood,7,28 July 2016,"Before I watched this movie, I heard about the negative reviews about it. I read that the CGI was awful and that acting was terrible.I must say people are too quick to criticize. This movie has a unique style and that is what made a lot of people to judge very quickly.This movie is not a realistic or historical representation of Egypt and it never tries to be. It is more of a picture of how gods would look like and with a taste of magic and dream. The fact that gods are portrayed twice the size of humans should be the first sign of this style.The color palette chosen for the movie is beautiful focusing on yellow of gold and brown of sand. This coupled with the vibrant and warm colors of the environments and set pieces create a delightful picture to watch.The story is interesting to follow as it unfolds right from the beginning of the movie with a clash between two brothers. As it is common in these kind of stories, the bad and the good characters are easy to see from the beginning.The CGI is mostly good and not as bad as it is called out by some people. The creatures are nicely created and the effects are mostly good with the exception of fire/explosion effects. There were times they felt a bit cheap considering the big budget of 140 million dollars of the movie.I really like the humorous conversations between Bek (Brenton Thwaites) and Horus(Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the god of sky. Brenton's character really added a much appreciated tone of fun to the movie and made me feel that familiar sense of feeling of similar movies like Prince of Persia(2010). Actually this movie has some resemblance even to the video game of Prince of Persia for example with the design of creature/guardians. Anyway Brenton Thwaites really puts a good performance and I am curious to see what he will be able to do in the upcoming Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.Gerard Butler fulfills his familiar role of war leader very well as expected, of course he is no stranger to these roles. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau does a great job portraying his character Horus as well. Although it would be nicer to see a bit more of his character's background.Overall this movie offers a fun, humorous, entertaining story in a fantasy world filled with magical powers of gods and hatred and love. This movie is bold, vibrant and fast, it's a shame some people couldn't see beyond the distinct choice of style, which I personally found interesting.",Gods of Egypt

419,jeneega,There was potential...,5,28 June 2016,"Set aside the ""whitewashed"" cast, and you still have an underwhelming film. I've always been a fan of Egyptian mythology, so I was excited when I saw the trailer for this film. After watching it, I was disappointed.Something that bothered me throughout ""Gods of Egypt"" was the fact that Set was the only one with a Scottish accent. (I know Gerard Butler is Scottish, okay?) The characters are obviously not supposed to have a Scottish accent. Though it's a minor detail, it's inconsistent, and just plain dumb.There were multiple cheesy scenes within the film--Bek and Zaya kissing whilst Bek holds up one of Horus' eyes when escaping the master builder and his guards, and Ra fighting off the ""space worms"" or what have you--to name a few. Even the slow motion during certain fight scenes was more so mediocre rather than impressive.Not to mention, the movie seemed to be very fast paced with a lot of skipping ahead. It was as if everyone in the film would come up with a plan, and in a mere matter of minutes, they would follow through with it. There was no thinking it over, or arguing-- everyone was so easily persuaded. It felt like everyone working on the film had a million of ideas and liked the sound of all of them, so decided to incorporate everything.Ultimately, I think the film had a lot of potential, but fell short.",Gods of Egypt

The setting of the film is created to take your breath and take you on a journey across the desolated deserts, going into the deepest jungles and then through the most populated parts of ancient towns. The beautiful relationship between Bek and Zaya will make you rethink what you know about the limits of love. Set's desire for power and his attitude towards his own nephew Horus will show you that times change as well as people's standards. The movie is definitely a must-watch even for viewers that are not into action or fantasy, because they will be left speechless by the personalities that they would meet during their 3D visit to Egypt.",Gods of Egypt

Just plain dumb! Not an Arabic looking actor in the film, the Egyptian God was , I don't know, Scotish? The only redeeming quality the movie had were some very pretty actresses, none of which were or looked Arabic. The plot was inane, Geoffrey Rush was so out of place it was laughable, almost, but not quite as laughable as the set-up for the sequel at the end...don't worry folks, there won't be a sequel. The CGI was over the top, as was the premise. I don't know what the director was trying to achieve other than launch a franchise, in that he failed and failed miserably.

Isn't that what going to the movies is all about with this genre of film?I did not expect a documentary, or academic deep dive into who, what and why ancient Egyptians (whoever they were, Nubian, black, white, rainbow) believe in their gods. I did however enjoy myself and had a laugh, and squirm on the way.Effects are pretty spectacular to say the least, and the story is told in a way that that mandates you chill and switch off from the everyday. After reading some of the trash reports, I suspect people are too full-on about everything these days, too ego centric... Lighten up people, it's a blockbuster, it's a bit of this and a bit of that, and a bit of something new and old.Damn fun if you can unplug from the politically correct madness of Hollywoood at the moment.

425,hairypodder,Definitely underrated.,7,23 May 2016,"I am - as quite a few other people - quite a bit surprised by the low rating many gave/give. This is a rather decent entertainment movie, not much more, but also not less.After I am growing somewhat tired of endless sequel/prequel Starwars, X-men and all the Marvel-stuff (...-men and alike), the turn to Egypt and it's mythology provides quite some freshness, some humour included, and surely a setting we did not see that often in recent years. So, if I may advise: general rating on IMDb are often rather misleading and you should give this movie sooner or later a chance - it is clearly nice to look at... ;)",Gods of Egypt
426,thegiant_potato,Underrated Fantasy/epic,8,21 August 2016,"The reviews around Gods of Egypt are outstandingly negative, however I myself viewed this movie prior to reading any reviews and actually quite enjoyed it. As one who knows and has studied Egyptian mythology I could not resist nitpicking some minor issues but these are simple ones at best. Simple issue I took was the use of the swords, as in Egypt the weapons were designed for slicing, not stabbing and thus the khopeshes were used wrongly, however the mere fact that they were featured was appreciated. Another nitpick I had was the failure that the actors had in pronouncing the name of my personal favourite goddess, Nephthys (pronounced Nef-tease), and her being depicted as the Goddess of Protection with wings when that was her sister Isis (the Goddess of kindness and healing). However, the portrayal of Nephthys as the former wife of Set was appreciated. Speaking of Isis, it would have been better if the filmmakers had taken the chance offered to them to reclaim the name of the Goddess of Kindness and Healing and named Isis by name as the wife to the god Osiris and sister to Nephthys. They're hesitation is understandable but still lamentable. Lastly, casting could have been done better with Egyptian actors in the mix. Understandably that is a short list, and so I feel the filmmakers could have mixed races somewhat better. I won't nitpick to extreme amounts and call white actors as bad as technically one could also say there were no blacks in Egypt as those were Nubians, however in this modern world a more mixed race of actors from various ethnicities such as white, black, and Mediterranean would have been appreciated. Yet, Lionsgate did own to this shortcoming and for that I score them points.I was most impressed with the portrayal of Anubis as a benevolent God of Death, something Hollywood is almost scared of doing. The relationship of the Gods to the mortals was also done accurately to that of the original mythologies, as Gods that walked with humans and ruled over them kindly. However, I digress. This move is not intended to be a history lesson, and it never pretends to be. I wanted to see the mythology I love to much that is so regularly ignored and replaced by watered down Greek mythologies portrayed on the big screen, and that is what I got. The story was well paced and brought some interesting questions on what death is and how it affects one as a transition from one life to the next. The epic elements needed in a fantasy of fast paced action, magic, were all present along with the clear person vs. deity aspect. Egypt, while clearly a CGI creation, was depicted very beautifully with stunning colours at the beginning and end, along with stunning displays of the God brilliance as they would transform to do epic battle with one another.In terms of story, as a character Bek did not evolve too much beyond ""I hate the Gods"" to ""I tolerate the Gods"" to ""I trust the Gods"". Perhaps this was a subtle spiritual journey for the viewer to attend to a question of what it means to find a personal faith than a grander faith. Bek and Zaya's relationship was standard, but it was not the primary focus of the film and seemed more obligatory. The relationship to focus on was not even that of Hathor (which considering she was actually Horus' adoptive mother this came off as creepy, not cute) and Horus, but actually Horus and Bek. Their journey progresses from that of a disinterested lord and lad to that of a journey of friends. Although the friends are not equal, they each have a piece to contribute to the overall whole, making Bek not the useless tag along for the movie, but an actual part of the plot. Actually, none of the characters appeared to serve no purpose. Even characters who had little screen time, such as Nephthys, advanced the plot in some way, which is something that many modern movies tend to forget. A rule of if a character does not continue story in some way, they are useless.Some aspects of the movie contradicted itself. Such were Hathor claiming she could control Gods, but not trying to control Set. Or Ra claiming to be unable to control death but resurrecting the mortals at the end without explanation. However, these errors were not worthy of calling the movie a failure. Clearly the writers were building for a sequel. Sadly critics have panned it, and it seems this is a movie to have a critical failure but a love of average audience ignoring internet websites that claim to speak for others. While a profit margin of only $5 million is unlikely to warrant a sequel, if Lionsgate were to create a second movie, and I imagine if they did they would strive to fix any errors from this film, I would be willing to pay the money to view it. I advise not reading mythology before watching this movie, but I would recommend it as a watch to scratch a need for an epic fantasy mired in the great Egyptian mythological story of the battle against Set. The story is a story loosely pulled from Egyptian belief where Set kills Osiris for the crown, and thus I would recommend exploring that story after watching this movie (as a mythological story can't possibly fully cross into a film, changes of course are necessary). Hopefully this movie, in some way starts a want in the world to learn more about this fascinating culture and seek to further explore stories around Egyptian beliefs, if not from the same series maybe another depiction using new viewpoints.",Gods of Egypt
427,rtdautel,Like it but.....,7,21 September 2016,"The movie was good, but the title didn't make that much sense, I would prefer Deicide as it is about a god that killed others to get more power.The gods, they don't have many abilities and instead represent something like love/air/life, I wouldn't recommend making another movie,it wouldn't make sense, Horus has learned to be a god,what is there else to know. It is exotic,too dramatic, there wasn't that much gold in a palace,and that was only one part,and why would Ra act like he cares about what happens when in reality he does nothing to prove his love for his own creation. It just needs to blend in with the real Egypt and yes I will choose 7 or 8 because some parts don't make sense and/or aren't part of the real Egypt.",Gods of Egypt

The story is very loosely based on Egyptian mythology. Cute love interests which lead to a predictable end do not ruin what is pure escapism fun. The main characters follow up on the characters they have portrayed in other films or series mainly Game of Thrones and 300. CGI although not cutting edge was OK. The ""brainy"" god was played with good humour and the sphinx was a bit ""Monty Python"" not that that's a complaint. Its not Shakespeare or Gladiator..its not even 300 but it was ""take your brain out, open a bottle of wine and enjoy!""

The premise of gods fighting in Egypt instead of Atlantis or Greece which we usually get, is clever. Too bad the creators forgot they were in Ancient Egypt. Yes, Egypt was occupied by the French and the Greeks at one point, but the movie takes place prior to that, and hmmm, it has 1 black character in it? Egypt has always been and is still on the continent of Africa, which means you need to have Africans in the movie. Every culture depicts their gods in their image, and neither of the gods were African nor did either of them have any of the 200+ African accents. In this day and age when the average 6th grader knows the story of Egypt; the mysterious pyramids, hieroglyphs, supernatural and spiritual rituals, the sphinx, pharaohs and cunning queens, it is grossly negligent to disregard major historical cultural aspects when producing something this wide reaching. Too bad, it could have been the start of a new trend in blockbuster action films of the ancient eras.",Gods of Egypt
431,amoledboy,A nice way to pass the time,7,2 January 2017,"I watched this on a tiny LCD screen on an interstate flight between Perth and Brisbane - probably not the best way to enjoy it. There weren't any other inflight films that interested me and I saw the director was Alex Proyas, so that even if it was a terrible film, it would at least have stunning visuals.The story is more Hollywood than Egyptian, one we've seen countless times before in films like The Karate Kid and Rocky III. The hero, the god Horus, gets his ass kicked and family slain by villain Set. He must then go on a quest to get his mojo back (assisted by a plucky sidekick), defeat the villain and get the girl back. Nothing wrong with that, it's a winning formula.The cast is certainly interesting. There is a generous helping of Australian talent including Bryan Brown and Geoffrey Rush, both playing Egyptian Gods! I didn't have a problem with most of the Egyptian characters being white and speaking in English accents. This is quite normal in Hollywood sword and sandal epics. I thought Brenton Thwaites was too pretty to play the part of Horus's human sidekick, he is almost godlike in appearance. They needed to cast someone with a scruffy street urchin look for the role. Elodie Yung is a standout as the goddess Hathor. She oozes languid sensuality and is able to be both slutty seductress and faithful partner without any contradiction.This film has copped a bit of flak for its CGI. I think it actually uses it well. CGI is best used to conjure supernatural worlds and fantastic beasts, not for explosions and car chases. I thought it was also clever how the gods had gold flowing through their veins instead of blood. This allowed the film makers to depict all sorts of stabbings, decapitations and eye gougings without showing any blood. Certainly, a good way to keep the all important PG rating.All in all, Gods of Egypt turned out to be a nice way to pass the time on my flight. I can't ask for more than that.",Gods of Egypt

It is a fantasy movie - and actually compared to some of the other takes on belief systems which have turned up recently (think Thor and Loki here) it is actually not that far out. Trying to explain the exact details of how the Egyptian pantheon worked would be beyond the scope of any movie, particularly as it changed over time and would not be entertaining to anyone who wasn't a scholar on the subject anyway. As to the subject of white actors - if you are going to have 10 feet tall gods, boats sailing through space and giant fire breathing worms I think you can give up on that kind of accuracy.

450,Rivermonsters,Much better than you have been told,8,2 March 2016,"So, this is a big budget action and special effects movie about Egyptian gods battling each other to rule the world, right? When you go to a movie like this, you have certain expectations--its not likely to be on the Best Picture short list next Oscar season, and everyone involved with making this movie knew this. But from the very first breathtaking camera shot, you can tell The Gods of Egypt was crafted with enthusiasm and a spirit of fun and unrelenting inhibition. For what this movie was striving for, it is absolutely on target. I saw it on IMax 3-D with my 5th and 7th grade sons, and we loved every minute! Visually dazzling, a soaring musical score, satisfying play-to-the-back-row acting, interesting and somewhat unfamiliar mythological characters, amazing costumes and set pieces--I think this film delivered on all fronts. In a way, Gods of Egypt is more original than many similar films of this genre in that it is not a prequel or sequel or reboot of a franchise, or a comic book adaptation. For instance, while it shares its episodic and implausible plot and style, it is a far more original film than the beloved Episode VII (but without decades of nostalgia and anticipation to paper over its weaknesses). It introduces and creates characters completely new to us in a fascinating and beautiful imaginary world. You will not forget the striking image of the stern but grandfatherly sun god Ra (Geoffrey Rush plays it large here!) circling the disk of the world with his space craft/chariot, sun in tow, as he daily battles a hideous chaos monster in defense of all humanity! The judgment of souls in the underworld is another well-presented scene. Horus has a nice character arc. It ends with a worthwhile message from the gods to humanity. More importantly, it literally offers a thrill or two every 5 minutes for its entire duration. And unexpectedly, this film has no mummies whatsoever! I feel the culturally inaccurate casting issue, while perhaps regrettable, brought an undeserved sense of negativity about this film. In any event, these actors appeared to be 100% invested in making this film work, and they got the job done, in my opinion. We recommend that you set this concern aside and enjoy the many pleasures The Gods of Egypt offers--a no-expenses-spared B movie that presents striking and immersive visuals, appealing characters, and a clear understanding of its limitations and aspirations. I seriously don't understand the horrible reviews, and suppose that people who hated this film probably brought a preconceived negative expectation in with their popcorn. Give it a chance, there is much to enjoy in The Gods of Egypt!",Gods of Egypt
451,emetr4,Great entertainment,10,1 January 2021,This was so entertaining and amazing. I loved it so much and went to the movie theater twice to see it. I kind of miss and want to see it again. Great fantasy movie.,Gods of Egypt
452,villemestari,Beautiful traditional fantasy adventure.,8,17 January 2017,"The Gods of Egypt is a beautifully told traditional fantasy story about love, hate, pride, envy, commitment, betrayal, sacrifice and many other essential themes of humanity wrapped in the cosmic struggle of light and darkness. It's by no means perfect, and some times the acting comes off as cringe-worthy, but the overall movie is well worth watching, and might just bring a tear or two to your eyes if you're not careful.This is the kind of film that can be safely enjoyed in any company, although the angstiest of teenagers might get uncomfortable with all the emotions, both joyful and sad, this movie takes you through. For adults and those young children whose innocence hasn't yet been spoiled by the act-tough teenager culture, this is a journey well worth taking.",Gods of Egypt
453,rai-915-997360,Loved it,9,27 August 2016,"Fun movie and the actors obviously loved making it. Humour and good acting. Lots of CGI which could have been better but it doesn't matter because the action and story keep you entertained. Preferred this to any of those super hero blockbusters because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Some of these reviewers just didn't get it and were expecting another USA fan boy comic movie. It works on the comic level too though just made in Sydney Australia with Canadian backing and lacks the USA flag waving. Another of those films that did a lot better internationally than in the US market. Australia's Brenton Thwaites was great as the young mortal and Game of Throne's Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as Horus was as good as always. It also included Scotland's Gerard Butler and Australia's Geoffrey Rush, Brian Brown and others. This is nothing like the Exodus of last year even though it seems to be similar in theme. A great movie for all ages that just rolls along with plenty to entertain and amuse you.",Gods of Egypt

MY KIDS LOVED IT MORE THAN ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" TO MY SURPRISE!!!",8,4 March 2016,"MY KIDS LOVE IT AND SO WILL YOURS!!! Magnificent (visually)!!! Why, because it's truly better than ""Clash of the Titans"" through the kids eyes!!! Gosh, adults are so spoiled today!!! Remember the kind of movies you used to see when you were a KID??? I wished there were movies like this in my childhood that are so visually stunning, plus thrilling with all those amazing unique characters!!! Didn't you loathe watching the same old movies on TV or in the theater as a kid and you had no choice? I grew up watching over and over, every single year, movies like ""The Thief of Bagdad"", ""Clash of the Titans"", ""Sinbad of the Seven Seas"", ""Moses"", ""Spartacus"", and various versions of Gladiator movies, too. I LOVE TO TAKE MY KIDS TO THE MOVIES ALL THE TIME, AND THEY HAVE SEEN LOTS OF SUMMER MOVIES EVERY SINGLE YEAR. SHOCKING TO ME AS A MOTHER, THAT MY 16 YEARS OLD, 12 YEARS OLD, AND 9 YEARS OLD SONS CLAPPED LOUDLY AT THE END OF THE MOVIE AND SAID THEY LOVED EVERY BIT OF IT. WHY, BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY WERE THE INDIANA JONES IN AN Egypt STORY, A THRILLING JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY ALL THROUGH THIS MOVIE, PLUS FIGHTING UNIQUE VILLAINS, CREATURES, AND GODS, AND THEY LOVED IT MORE THAN THE NEW STAR WARS MOVIE. I love Star Wars, but I grew up with it as a child, while my kids watch too much Star Wars cartoons on cable and seen all the past Star Wars movie. THIS IS AN ULTRA FANTASY MOVIE, SO DIFFERENT FOR MY KIDS EYES THAN TYPICAL STAR TREK, STAR WARS, AND A BUNCH OF OTHERS. MY KIDS GOT TO BECOME VARIOUS DIFFERENT AND THRILLING CHARACTERS ALL THROUGH THIS MOVIE, SO WILL YOURS TOO. I enjoyed this so much more than Clash of the Titans. In this movie, there's hot muscular men for the ladies and drop dead gorgeous model-like ladies for the men. So everybody wins!!! LOL! The only reason it didn't do well is that it should have come out in the summer, NOT after Deadpool, which ROCKS or after Valentine's Day. It's worth the RPX expensive tickets I spent. We had a blast!!! Hope for more positive reviews!!! Definitely, worth watching in the theater, NOT in a few month on your TV. I have a 80"" TV and the theater is still fantastic for these types of action pack movies!!!",Gods of Egypt
455,zerosky,Read the Reviews not the Rating,7,26 September 2018,"At the time of writing the rating is 5.4. which I think is far to low. I agree with the positive reviews. Yes it has all the cliches and inconsistencies you would expect from such a CGI festival of ancient myths, but above all it is an enjoyable movie.
I don't generally watch the marvel/star wars type movies so I was tempted to give this a wide berth however I have an interest in Egyptian mythology fully expecting to turn it off after ten minutes or so. The special effects are spectacular and the humour is unexpected. 
I can understand the critics rating of a measly 25 I wouldn't have expected anything else from them, but this film is also better than the current 5.4",Gods of Egypt
456,szilvahusika,Enjoyed it very much!,9,5 March 2016,"It's pure fun! I don't get the negativity,this movie is very enjoyable. Solid story, good music, very good 3D. Loved the costumes! There was a bunch of interesting ideas.Action-packed,and it teaches us a lesson about judging a person's worth.Critics are morons.So in my humble opinion,this was a wonderful sci-fi fantasy movie with gorgeous costumes, rich artistic design and a fun story. Quit taking yourself so seriously and go and have fun at the movies for a change!!!!I'm talking to the professional critics,You got it way wrong on this film!!!

457,hanie_nautica,Mediocre,4,28 February 2016,"Where to begin.Nice graphics, nice effects, but the idea was probably better than the result. I didn't expect much, since as soon as I saw the trailer and saw Butler stars in it, I kinda expected it will not be good. Not saying I don't like Butler, but he was such a BAD BAAAAD terrible choice for this role, it could be worse only if it was Adam Sandler.Bek and Zaya relationship and characters were too cheesy and the whole thing didn't work out too well. All the stuff with him going to steal eyes for Horus happened too fast, the storytelling had huge holes in it. Then there are the way over-the-top parts like the whole Ra character and Seth attaching parts of other gods to his body...etc. Overall watchable, but nothing that would stand out or would blow you away.After The Crow and I, Robot, Proyas made a very mediocre piece. Fit for carefree popcorn night for people that just want to kill time and don't look for a decent cinematography.",Gods of Egypt
458,valkyriaza,Underrated good fun movie,9,18 July 2016,"Having heard the tremendous amount of negative reviews I was somewhat hesitant to see the movie. I'm glad to have watched it. It's not likely to win any Oscars, but for once it's not a reboot or a sequel.This is pure escapism with good CGI, an enjoyable story and some decent acting. True, the story isn't very complicated, but it depicts a hero's journey very well. Two heroes, a sceptical thief and a defeated god. The fact that they made Gods as separate race of beings, easily over 10 feet tall with golden blood was an added bonus to emphasise that despite their human features, they are anything but. Elodie Young as Hathor was probably one of my favourites. The story resisted the trope portraying her as Egyptian Venus, instead using another one of her roles as the ""Mistress of the West"", welcoming people into the next life. Another very pleasant surprise was the architect played by Rufus Sewell. A minor role, but performed extremely well.I do wish they spent more time explaining about the afterlife and the role of Apophis. All in all, good fun.",Gods of Egypt
459,nelson_paul,Not good,2,27 August 2021,"A decent cast but that's about it. The acting was awful and dialogue even worse. Bek doesn't speak like he's ever had a conversation in his life, whether that's the actor's ability or the way he was written.CGI at times wasn't good at all.A barely watchable movie.",Gods of Egypt
460,sharonhuxley,Puerile Rubbish,1,1 July 2016,"The high marks for this movie are obviously bogus. It looks to have been written by a twelve-year old. There are no redeeming features, unfortunately. Sadly it is utter childish rubbish. This movie was so awful I could not leave this site without remarking on it's utter lack of plot or credibility. The information states that it cost $140,000,000 to produce.

I watched this on a pirated 480p dvdrip on my iphone 4s. The CGI was stunning! The scenery was so authentic I really felt i was in the ancient Egypt. (by the way, did you know Egypt is located in Asia?) The main role is played by the handsome Jaime Lannister, and King Leonidas. (How did he get all the way from Sparta to Asia?) I personally believe the actors used method acting, because you could really see the raw emotions portrayed in this masterpiece of a movie. TMZ also reported that Jaime Lannister walked around with a blindfold for a whole year preparing for this movie. Thats what I call dedication! This movie made Egypt great again. This movie brings forth so many emotions, and i can personally promise you that when Bek smiles, you will smile too. 10/10 will watch again, instant classic!",Gods of Egypt

The CGI was also in some places like Play-Doh stop motion. It was such a mess this movie that it ended up being somewhat entertaining. Watch it just so you can have a giggle that they spent 140 million making it and have just this to show for it.",Gods of Egypt
467,lil-shakespeare,I absolutely love this movie,10,14 December 2016,"I liked the movie very much. Not every movie needs to be dark and Nolan-ish and we need more movies like this. I believe most negative reviews come from the not so convincing performance of Bek who needs more experience but did fairly well, the overly funny God of wisdom who could have been written better, more serious and with a more mystical allure and last but not least with the overly villainous part played by G. Butler who went a little over the edge with his acting here. Still, even so. A love story played on multiple fronts with great characters and a good plot.

This 2 hour torture session will make you leave your sit and hope you were just having a bad dream. The entire Egypt population has been whitewashed and turned into blue eyed blondies. It's OK, if you put history aside and just enjoy the ride, the problem is, this isn't even the biggest issue that makes Gods of Egypt such a flop. The CGI were just UNBEARABLE and it makes me wonder how any human being (or even gods) could think that this was OK to be released to public. If the visual effect supervisor ever get another job, it would be nothing less than a miracle.It was impossible to like any of the characters, also. I couldn't care less about those guys with such a bad acting on screen. The comic approach they've tried - maybe taking a hike in Marvel's successful action-comedy-light movies - didn't work here at all.In the end, established names as Gerard Butller and even a decent actor as Chadwick Boseman (Black Panther) will eventually look back and think, ""why did i ever do this?""Do your brain a favor and run away from this.",Gods of Egypt

The whole point of making a film is make the audience forget they are watching a film. With its bad casting and the none existence of black people was a ignorant decisions. I guess that's a Hollywood thing. The statues where also not correct in the introduction. I found it to be just a lazy production. I also felt the screening was wrong. At times it felt like the camera shots where framed to far at times. East Enders in Africa is how I would describe this for friends. The narration should have stopped but it drones on seeking to save more money on actual screen play. you may find a few miss matches in sets due to mixing scenes like a day time TV feel show then back again.,Gods of Egypt

Another patron must have purchased a small size, because she left before I did. And, as there were only four of us in the theater, in a small town in the afternoon, that was half of the viewers! Nothing was engaging. I'm not normally a sci-fi, mythological, special effects, solid action type of movie-goer. I went to see ""Thor"" because it was all that was playing and LOVED it, because it was a good and very entertaining movie, snappy dialogue, etc.This movie was just plain awful. I couldn't believe the crappy special effects, especially in light of some of the amazing movies out lately (like Thor). The dialogue sucked. The big-God/little-mortal thing was creepy.I believe I've only walked out of two movies in my whole life: The Leopard with Burt Lancaster (yes, back when dinosaurs roamed the earth) and Wild Hogs (but I rented that, so I it doesn't really count).

473,ausland-james,Enjoyable Entertainment for the Family,7,25 May 2016,"Personally while I feel there were a great many flaws in the movie. I still found much enjoyment in watching it. Yes the CGI was fairly poor. But it was not so horrendous as to render it unwatchable. I also like Gerald Butler and the guy who played Horus. I would like to see a sequel where Horus goes after the Goddess of Love Hathor. It is in my opinion a worthy buy when it comes out on Blu-Ray. I hope that if they do ever get a green light they fix a few things but in general keep the same flow as they had in this film. I wouldn't mind seeing some of those characters return. Anyways I love Egyptian Mythology and even though this was not something you'd want to base your term paper on. It was still something to eat some popcorn invite a chick over and have a nice evening while watching a action/love story. I may seem to be all over the place but that is because I just finished watching it myself. I wasn't disappointed in the film. Nor did I care that most of the main actors were ""White"". Personally if you look back in the history of acting it really didn't matter the color or sex as most actors who even played women were men dressed up. So I don't hop on this senseless PC race train. I just watch for the story or the plain entertainment of the film. So I say bring on another one. Or write some cheap novels based off the screen play I'd read it.",Gods of Egypt

A task that outshines the level of effort put into the making of this joke of a movie.It failed to hold my interest for more than 30 minutes by which time I felt I wanted to pour bleach on my eyes. A colossal failure of a movie adding insult to injury by associating itself with a great ancient civilization. The Pharoahs are puking in their dead mouths as we speak. This movie could exterminate rats who would die from boredom and frantically claw out each other's eyes. It helped me appreciate other movies I thought were bad.

When reading some of the negative or poor reviews, it bring me to the truth that I know that there are some people that are just too up tight, or just like to put other people's work down. To each their own.If you enjoy a good, clean (I don't recall any bad language in this move), action and adventure move, go see this movie on the big screen and enjoy it.

Bland.,4,25 February 2016,"Yet another mixture of all the famous tropes that you've already seen in a hundred different movies, veiled in a somewhat interesting setting that just doesn't work.It was an interesting concept, that fell completely flat due to lack of originality in every thing the movie tries to do. Action scenes couldn't convey any emotions, dialogues and plot felt completely bland with a number of low-effort comedy scenes and a cast that simply didn't fit. But what about the visuals? Well, the movie tried to put special effects in every second of the movie. That resulted in half of them being noticeably terrible and unconvincing. Some of these could be called more or less spectacular, yet certainly hard to appreciate considering how most of it was gibberish.In case you're still considering going to the cinema: my only advice is to watch the trailer carefully to see if you don't get put off by some of the special effects.

487,moalchemist,"Stunning Visuals, Boundless Potential, yet Wretched Pathetic Scripting",3,7 March 2016,"I for one was extremely enthusiastic towards the idea of a movie revolving around Egyptian mythology - especially in light of all the Greek-centric movies out there. I cannot stress how beautiful and stunning the imagery was throughout the entirety of the film. Although the look of the transformed Horus came off as entirely overdone and banal in reference to the myriad of other protagonists in shows and movies in the last few years appearing with similarly angel-esque wings, the vast majority of the visuals were outstanding.Several enthralling concepts were also presented that added a very distinct flavor to the movie - concepts rarely if ever dealt with or portrayed, especially in this genre. The breath-taking view of the flat-earth, the idea of Ra fighting off a giant alien-esque behemoth as it came from the void to devour the earth - both elements fairly unique to the film. But the script and the plot in general were just appalling. To preface, if any of my specific complaints are due to not personally being that familiar with Egyptian mythology than the movie could be argued to have failed in educating its viewers to the point where things made enough sense.Firstly, I am a strong proponent for the concept that any notion, no matter how seemingly far-fetched can be made believable if enough energy is put into justifying or explaining how such a thing happened. So Set is warring across the lands and taking out kingdoms of other gods... Wait, explain to me why the Gods haven't teamed up to take this pretentious prick out? No explanation is given so we are left to assume that either the other gods are all insufferably obtuse or the film-makers didn't care to enlighten us or just flat- out didn't have a reason. But why not??? It would be so easy to implement and would add so much value! It would be as easy as making up some kind of deity-level contract/oath/bloodoath/whatever that prevented the gods from banding together in some interesting and intriguing way. Oh noes! Set is attacking us one by one and we are all under oath so we can't intervene; all we can do is wait until it's our turn! But again, no attempt at an explanation was given.And if Set is so secluded, god of the barren deserts, how does he have the backing and the manpower to take out every single other god? Does he actually rule his own city? Is his army magically conjured? Did he steal another god's army? And if he has his own city, why is he acting so incredibly petulant and butt-hurt? Wait, so Set is super lonely and forlorn and boo-hoo poor baby but he has how many other gods working for him? Minotaur gods (that obviously don't deserve god-hod given their pitiful fight scene) and two random snake-affiliated gods? Were they always working together? Were they aligned with the rest of the gods then turned on them? Why even portray random NPC minotaur 1, 2, and 3 as gods at all? Why not portray them as beasts instead of diluting the semblance of potency of the gods?And the scene with the hall of traps... So let me get this straight: not only is their an easy-to-access blueprint showing most of the traps but the floor is covered with scorpions - and you just dump tons of gold onto the floor. There was infinitely more thought put into the revolving clockwork-esque mechanism through which the gold was dumped then the actual vault/trap-room. To top it all off, the character Beck (sp?) rides an avalanche of gold ornaments, tools, possibly blades and then jumps a good 50 or more feet down onto a pile of the same stuff and escapes without a scratch. Then he somehow escapes the vault because in all that time, no magical alarms went off, the scorpions are allergic to shiny eyeballs, and apparently the vault is really easy to get out of - easy enough to not warrant showing it on scene.Beck's lover is shot with an arrow that drives deep into her boob. He quickly rips out the barbed, wide-headed arrow with little to no reaction from the girl and leaving only a tiny hole from which she barely oozes a drop of blood yet somehow dies seconds (or was it minutes? Hours? Days?) later. I certainly hope it wasn't as quick of a chariot ride as it appeared because that would mean Horus was living in exposed squalor within a huge hard-to-miss landmark just a quick jog from Set. Which provokes the question: If Set knows where Horus is, why is he still alive?Beck in general is way too cheesy - everything he says just drips cheesiness... He is the abomination birthed of the stereotypical fantasy- themed rogue-type and Aladdin - a combination ill-fitting the epic potential of the movie.I could go on for days but the point is the visuals and concepts were amazing but they were overshadowed with an ill-conceived atrocious plot and script.9/10 on visuals 6/10 on innovative themes/concepts 1/10 on plot 2/10 on acting 1/10 on script",Gods of Egypt

I don't have a problem with how inaccurate the movie is, but poor acting cannot be forgiven. The storyline isn't great either. They could have done a better job at making the story more compelling. The shoddy acting just adds to the already shoddy storyline, and the CGI is the final nail in the coffin.",Gods of Egypt
489,cygarcia-17815,Best action movie seen so far,10,25 February 2016,"I enjoyed this over the top extravagant adventure set in Ancient Egypt. The script cleverly uses the legends of the Egyptian gods. It's fun to see the god brought to life and transform into various birds and beasts. Now everyone can visualize the gods instead of imagining them from a 2 dimensional painting on a wall. The tale of Horus avenging the murder of his father Osiris by fighting Set is brought to life. The visuals are spectacular dizzying and fantastical. You get some pretty impressive cities temples caves tombs pyramids and the underworld. This movie was so far the best action this year. I don't know why people are hating. This movie was fun, entertaining, funny, loved the action scenes. Loved how the movie was viewed just like the stories we all loved in school. You won't be disappointed. Got to see this movie at a prescreening. Loved it. Would watch again.",Gods of Egypt
490,blvds,God-Awful Casting,2,28 February 2016,"Of note, I adore this type of silly romp and Gerard Butler is one of my absolute favorites. With that said, could they possible have done a worse job of casting the leads in this movie (It was as if he reprized One Two from, Rocknrolla, but wearing ""godly"" armor)? There are many excellent actors out there that would have been able to pull off the leads: take Oded Fehr for example; while not from Egypt, he's at least from the same continent and has the look, talent and comedic timing, sorely missing in this movie, to make an excellent Horus (Amr Waked would have made an wicked Set). Pretty much any decent actor would have filled the role of the young hero better than the insipid portrayal by Brenton Thawaites.Visually this was enjoyable and I wanted to like it. The $17.00 for the (3D) ticket was the only thing that kept me from walking out.",Gods of Egypt

The gods had beautiful and epic costumes. I can see some scenes at time being unrealistic, yes, but this is mythology! If you want a down to earth movie, then this is not for you. As for the actual characters, I was surprised at how some gods were so weak. The actors matched the characters they portrayed aside from the fact that some looked so old when as a god, I don't think they needed to look that way. Battle music could have been an addition they could have done. The transformations were super cool. I would highly recommend this movie. It is one of my favourites and will probably be wanting to see it again in theatres.",Gods of Egypt
492,dacmqc,Awesome Clean Movie,10,1 March 2016,"I thought the movie was creative with an actual story and plot that was easy to follow. The graphics were good. And the best part, it was clean like the old Hollywood movies that required wit, true acting, and not just zeroing in on the eyes and expressions for fake dramatics. If you don't like mythology or science fiction, then no you probably won't like it, but if you like mythology, then it's good. It adds a twist to that old traditional take on mythology. Just need an open mind.It was weird seeing Gerard Butler as the antagonist, but he did a good job of playing the part. It was a nice change to see real acting for a change instead of the played up camera zooming.",Gods of Egypt

Can't believe there's even 5 star ratings for this film. lions gate needs to get it together and so do the reviewers . The fact this movie was even created makes me want to vomit .

I knew that it would be great on the big screen and regardless what the ""professional critics"" said, I could not wait to see it. I agree that it won't win best picture of the year but if you are open to seeing an amazing cinematic imagery then you will love it. The base story has it's positive and negative but it made sense. Yes there was lots of CGI but it was perfect if you compare it to the 'Mummy' series of movies with Brendan Fraser. I can't wait to what it when it comes out on Blue-ray.

A bit of a farce and some of the animation could have been better. However still an excellent movie. These actors appeared to be 100% invested in making this film work, and they got the job done, in my opinion. I'm extremely impressed to see this excellent movie based on ancient Egypt that is certainly for me this movie has done justice for the money invested.Critics are again all over the fact that predominantly white actors are playing Egyptians, oh come on!

496,mathgrl-10673,I Really Enjoyed this Movie!,9,7 March 2016,"Gods of Egypt wasn't the movie I set out to watch, last Saturday, but, boy, am I glad that my first choice was unavailable. Otherwise, I would have missed this striking, action-packed, energetic and flashy movie. I had a blast, and plan to see it again. There was something for everyone; great special effects, romance, action, danger and humor.While it did not adhere particularly closely to Egyptian mythology, that's probably for the best. Some of those myths can get pretty disturbing. What it did do was deliver lots of fun and eye-candy. I did not leave my seat, glance at my phone messages or remember my popcorn, once the movie began. When you stop chewing and forget where you are, you know you're having fun at the movies.The characters were enjoyable (especially Horus, who came across as grumpy and hung-over, at first, but eventually got himself sorted). Set was genuinely villainous, and Ra's flat Earth, Sun-towing scene a real treat. I found myself really liking Hathor, as well. The two kids, Bek and Zaya, were cute, reminding me just a little of Aladin and Jasmine. Yu genuinely cared about Zaya, on her journey through the frighteningly bleak Egyptian underworld. About Hathor, too, actually, but I won't spoil things and say why.Personally, I rate this movie on par with Avengers: Age of Ultron, and above the last Star Wars movie, which I saw just once. Go see Gods of Egypt. You'll be glad that you did.",Gods of Egypt

Reviewers compared this to Clash of the Titans. This is a far better movie.Maybe people just don't like Egypt. All the negativity associated with mid east turn people off. Thus the low rating.

The CGI was great. The action scenes were full on. Time passed quickly, so the editing was spot on. Go and see it, especially if you are Australian! Support our film industry.

499,lemonadenomore,Ironic resemblance to reality,9,31 August 2016,Wow.. I won't go through technical evaluation but what really struck me with that movie is the Ironic resemblance to reality ... the dialogue between Raah and Horus when he was debating that Set was a bad ruler for Egypt and his answer that Apophis (god of chaos) is the worst fate that can strike Egypt and that he is worse than Set !! As an Egyptian I can say that this is so true even now .. chaos is the worst fate that already struck the middle east and we managed to escape it so far .. well I won't dwell on other aspects of resemblance ..The movie is worth seeing and is inspiring ..acting of Gerard Butler is as usual great although he offered nothing new in this role . Graphics are amazing and in general this movie is quite entertaining and greatly underrated . I am half way through the movie so far but had to write this comment before I forgot it as I usually enjoy movies with subtle substance. maybe would come back for more :),Gods of Egypt
500,eddiepryor,Don't listen to reviews and critics they are miss-leading,10,16 June 2016,"OK this is the first time I am leaving a review and I just couldn't stand these bad reviews that are like for nothing. The movie is ABSOLUTELY great and you will not lose interest not even for 2 minutes since it's a major action-adventure movie with great actors and cast choice, following very awesome and interesting story line that will make you wonder throughout the movie how will things turn out to be. It wasn't very predictable even tho it wasn't complex AT ALL. Some of these reviews make me wonder if people enjoy any movie without finding or creating the slightest reason to be dramatic and annoying, just like the reason most reviews I read here saying the actor choice is TOO white? Are you kidding me this is a Hollywood made, fiction movie about the Egypt and gods and powers and that's what bothered them really? Anyways the movie is awesome and like I said don't bother reading reviews. thanks",Gods of Egypt
501,ns-34985,Thrilling and Exciting Movie that Still Got it ALL WRONG,6,13 May 2016,"Oh God, yet ANOTHER movie about a WHITEWASHED version of Egypt. Based on ancient Egyptian mythology, Gods of Egypt features the epic journey of a mortal named Bek to save his true love from death and rescue Egypt. Along the way, he is assisted by the god of the air, Horus, who is fighting against Set, the god of darkness who has proclaimed himself the rightful ruler of Egypt. This film has everything an eager movie goer could want: an out-of-this world plot, special effects, an epic setting (who doesn't like Ancient Egypt??), romance, thrill, humor, and sweeping music. YET...it is about as accurate as watching an ALL BLACK version of 300 (Spartan movie) or Gladiator. Hollywood would be in an uproar. I'm sorry but as much as I liked the movie, I couldn't feel at ease sitting and watching a BOLD-FACED LIE. The whole time I felt like I was in some sort of DELUDED Caucasian/Asian FANTASY of an Egypt without African roots. There were just too many subtly insulting scenes in the movie to mention, but the overall feeling I got from the film was a sense of European ego-centrism. The only significant black character is Thoth, the god of wisdom; couldn't even make one goddess a Black woman even though they were often the rulers of ancient Egypt. No, the actress playing Hathor, the goddess of love, only serves to propagate racist, mainstream standards of beauty (non-black beauty), even if she's NOT blond haired and blue eyed. The idiot producers in Hollywood haven't figured it out yet (or they have and just don't want to ADMIT it)! The ORIGINAL ancient Egyptians were NUBIANS, Africans and people of color. It wasn't until the Hittites and other Caucasian peoples completely invaded Egypt that it became the diluted Egypt of today (Read The Destruction of Black Civilization by Chancellor Williams). That's why there are these delusions with some Arabs/Asians having the audacity and arrogance to somehow assume they ONLY are the true Egyptians (or denying Africans are). Look at movies like The Mummy, etc. Some may dismiss this as an Afrocentric rant and say that color doesn't matter and all that BS. But as a person of African descent, it's a little annoying to constantly have OUR history INACCURATELY portrayed by people who don't really wish to acknowledge us in the first place. STOP hijacking our history and projecting yourself into EVERY area of history you think you can do so!!! Hey Hollywood and SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT, get a clue from DREAMWORKS and have some historical accuracy. Look The Prince of Egypt, Joseph King of Dreams, and even La Reine Soleil (produced by Cinemon Studios). They got it right, and those are ANIMATED movies. Oh but why wouldn't they want to use an all- black cast? Because most whites would never want to see it, as they LACK empathy for brown/black people, as proved in scientific studies. I wouldn't be surprised if half the people watching this movie wouldn't entertain the idea of a Black Egypt. No, not just one anomaly black pharaoh but a lineage of African rulers who spanned many dynasties. All- in-all, maybe the movie would be 10 stars if they got the BASICS right.",Gods of Egypt
502,hannahjfloto,So far from the Stories of the Egyptian Gods,5,31 May 2016,"I had such high hopes at the beginning even when I watched the trailer, and yet I quickly became disappointed. It strayed so far from the actual stories of the Egptian Gods that I couldn't enjoy the movie. You can't kill a God so the entire idea of half of the movie makes no sense. It felt like they were taking the titles of the Gods and just making a whole new story line out of it. The CGI was good, and some of the humor, but I just found myself getting mad at the story and feeling exasperated all the way to the end. There are many loopholes in my opinion. And merging the parts of Gods together? Really? The architecture wasn't Egyptian, the clothing wasn't Egyptian, Ra looks nothing like the paintings. The Mythology was just absolutely destroyed in my opinion.",Gods of Egypt

Great actors who decided to read and memorize this script.. i guess they needed the money really bad.My other issue with this movie is the same as with most movies like this, the accents.The CG for me wasn't as bad as some said for me it's the story and the way it's being told from beginning to end, and i get that it's an action adventure but get the history right at least. It plays more like Aladdin the animated version i mean writers try harder next time the public is a lot smarter than the stuff you guys are putting out.

504,garygouge-24339,A Disappointing CG Fest,3,9 June 2016,"I am a fan of actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, that is why I felt empathy for him being associated with such a bad film. The amount of CG used in the movie was staggering, even taking into consideration that the world was mostly make believe. No effort was taken to use any tangible locations. I do have to give a little credit to all the actors, considering they most likely spent day after day filming in front of a green screen. The amount of CG was one thing and the poor CG quality was another. Coaster-Waldau, although solid, could not carry the entire film. The rest of the actors were indistinguishable and generally poor. The plot was uncomplicated, predictable, and bland. The premise of the movie was sound, it just wasn't executed competently.",Gods of Egypt

After watching it and expecting it to be horrible, I was surprised to find it was way better then all the people complaining about it claimed. The story did not follow the Egyptian mythology completely and you could see many changes in the movie. Despite all of that it still made for very good entertainment. This is a movie I can enjoy watching multiple times. I loved the CGI and the way the actors portrayed their characters. I hope they make other movies like this in the future because I will definitely watch. I have come to the conclusion that I should watch more movies that get negative reviews because it seems more often then not, most of these reviewers get it wrong and the movies turn out way better than they say.",Gods of Egypt
506,phionix,"Excellent visuals and great actors, that's it",3,12 June 2016,"This movie kinda of sucked. I would have given it two stars, were it not for the visuals and the actors Butler and Waldau. Forget about the whole mostly-white-actors-in-a-movie-set-in-Egypt, forget about that. Something that irked me, almost more than what I am to talk about later, were the lame, ""witty"" jokes- the comments down the road, the whole trying to take a break from action by pausing a few seconds just to say something ""funny"", even though it was in the midst of the heat of all of it. And the thing is, it was darn corny and stupid! I couldn't even laugh, it was just really distracting!Now for the main part, I HATED how they progressed so easily, so quickly- NO effort. The problem solving was so straight forward, no struggle at all. This took away the excitement, the thrill- no blood pumping here, just my neck aching from having to drag myself through this movie. The lines the poor actors had to say in this movie, I mean- who wrote this? Seriously? I cringed whenever something dramatic was happening, I would rather hear them do the boring ""journey talk"" they did during some points in the movie. Actually, I cringed over how casually they said anything in the movie, except for epic Gerard Butler, as he was mostly like he was in all his badass movies.And bad fights, like wow, bad. Only visuals saved them from me just shutting off.Enough ranting now, for short:Good:Great visualsGreat actors (Fan of Gerard Butler, hehe)BAD:Witty, not-so-witty comments throughoutCringy manuscript, couldn't even move the most sensitive person in the whole world. (Bad acting, seemed like the actors struggled to make it flow because of how the lines were set up)Boring problem solving all the way, it was made too easily, too sudden and with no struggle at all (plus the annoying ""jokes"" [?] in the midst of it.)Bad fights, and they were the best part because of the visuals.By the way, I kind of don't like how people give more stars to off- set the bad reviews from other reviewers, JUST because they want to defend it from critique with mostly white actors for characters from Egypt. People can say it had a bad impact on their experience of the movie, since after all- the setting was Egypt and Egyptian gods, hence they can rate it from that point on. But to give it MORE stars to off-set the bad reviews on the non-logical casting of the movie is plain moronic, you ruin the whole rating system because you do not review based on the movie, but on what others have rated it as- and no, I do not care about the white actors at all. Actors are actors, as long as they do great, I don't care!",Gods of Egypt
507,ZeroReviews,Gods of Egypt is so laughably bad that it's for sure entertaining,3,13 July 2016,"Gods of Egypt is definitely an entertaining movie, but in all the wrong ways. Almost everything about it is hysterically awful. You will laugh your ass off throughout the movie, not because of the ""jokes"" in the film, but because of the dialogue, the CGI, the acting, etc.The setting for the movie was to be it's strongest asset. When was the last time we got to see a movie set in Egyptian mythology? However, the movie does not do it's setting justice and people who like the mythology would be ashamed by how the movie interprets it.The dialogue for the movie is horrendous. Every single line is either an exposition line or a horribly unnatural and forced line. The characters are are all so one-dimensional, each seemingly having only one personality trait, and only a very small amount of characters undergo the tiniest bit of development. Because of this, we're given no reason to care about anyone. A good portion of the lines are so hilarious, not because they were funny, but because they're entertaining in the sense that people actually came up with this dialogue and others approved of it.Being a huge, high-budget, blockbuster action movie, you would think that it would be at least cool to look at. To be honest, the CGI and special effects are a mixed bag. Most of the time, everything looks awful. There is not a single shot in the movie which looks real and everything is so obviously green-screen. However, there are still a few CGI moments that don't look terrible. However, it doesn't make a movie good, it just means that there are some decent-looking effects in an otherwise garbage movie.I can't believe the talent behind the movie created such a piece of garbage. I would give it a 1, but the movie is so entertaining because of how bad it is, it gets a 3 purely because it's entertaining. Watch the movie if you're drunk at a party with friends but don't watch the movie because you want to watch an awesome, action-packed movie.",Gods of Egypt
508,andresaren,Why ruin a great story?,4,17 August 2016,"This is a movie of ancient gods, their flaws, greed and motives. A story for the ages where Egyptian gods, flawed by their humane desires, walk side by side with native mortals. A true Cinderella story where all is normal, then turned into chaos, climaxing with dreadful end of the world type happenings summoning unlikely heroes and ending in a rather ceremonious great resurrection of life and peace. Even with all of the supernatural beings and gods ruling over humans, or mortals as this film says, the story remained within the humane lines of moral dilemmas and relations between admiration and resent, love and hate, greed and generosity and trusting or doubting others. Really, this motion picture is a visually beautiful, often quite remarkable, piece of cinema, sadly, eternally ruined by poorly edited and rushed content. This potential diamond was honestly neglected enough so that it was reprocessed into mere coal. This was noticeable from pretty much the first scenes already. The actors dialogues felt very forced up to the point where I could imagine the director, Alex Proyas, shouting for actors to be quicker and less savoring with their lines. The scenes were too hastily run through and as this progressed throughout the film, the quality of a golden story was turned into a, at most, B-class film. I expected more and thought it could've been a bit slower with the progression of things, instead of rushing into events and lines like some kind of a speed trial. If I could I would choose not to watch it, just to save the thought of a great, action filled, story with gods and mortals. I'm sorry for the actors and the teams behind this movie.

Never seen anything like this so massive congrats to the makers for pushing the boundaries. The humour was funny and worked well throughout. The casting is spot on - every actor played their part fantastically well. Character development is awesome - I ended up really liking all lead characters. Good job. The special effects are top notch and the pacing is fast - never a dull moment with this movie. If you like the fantasy genre you'll love this - everything you could ask for - believable monsters, exciting fight scenes, epic scale, beautiful backdrops (Egypt is amazing), a bit of magic and some extra stuff that you'll have to watch to find out but works really well and really adds another dimension to the film. I really hope that they make a sequel. The romance is believable and moving - and I'm not usually a big fan of romance in fantasy films. This production really carries you away to another world to enjoy - and that's what I look for in a good flick. There's so many twists, turns, unexpected stunts and unusual story elements - it really is a great story.

For all you that do not understand what the big deal is, the equivalent would be watching a Thor movie Oden played by James Earl Jones, Fyorgyn - Alfre Woodard, Thor- Michael B Jordan, and the only Caucasian god (a sub level one at that) in the movie was Mr. Bean.
