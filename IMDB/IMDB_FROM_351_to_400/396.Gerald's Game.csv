0,Leofwine_draca,Bad adaptation of a bad book,2,14 October 2017,"GERALD'S GAME stands out as the worst Stephen King novel I've ever encountered, a near-plot less journey through various concepts all based around a single-location thriller, which I typically love. I found it dragged out endlessly and entirely dull, and guess what? This unappetising film follows suit.As in the novel, the premise is a workable one. The attractive Carla Gugino is handcuff to a bed in a remote cabin and must figure out a way to escape. However, as with the book, the whole film is chock full of irrelevant sub-plots, unpleasant flashbacks about child abuse, and a ridiculous 'bogeyman' storyline that destroys all credibility. The actual present-day/non-hallucination material is very limited.What's worst about this is the endless inane back-and-forth dialogue with the imaginary characters, which truly takes the biscuit. There are flashes of strong material, including a very nasty gore scene, but they come few and far between.",Gerald's Game
1,SnoopyStyle,more than the simple initial premise,7,1 March 2018,"Jessie (Carla Gugino) and Gerald Burlingame (Bruce Greenwood) are having marital problems. They go to an isolated lake front house for a weekend retreat. He surprises her as he handcuffs her to the bed for some sex games. She is reluctant and then he collapses. A stray dog walks thru the open front door and Jessie is alone.The premise is simple enough based on a Stephen King story. I'm not entranced by the imaginary conversations and in the end, she's talking to herself. It's not until the flashbacks that this becomes more than a survival thriller. The survival thriller half is fine and the backstory adds the emotional impact. Gugino is a solid veteran actress doing a superb job. It becomes more than the initial simplistic concept.",Gerald's Game
2,kosmasp,Cuckoo,7,26 March 2019,"Loco is also something one may say. Now the movie starts off pretty normal, but gets dark quite quickly. And when I say dark, you may feel a cringe/chill sneaking up on you. The way the couple works, the mechanics of their relationship is quite something. And by something I mean crazy. But just because they ... act like that, doesn't mean there is not more going on.Actually the more the movie goes on, the more crazy everything gets. Which makes sense if you think about it. But then sense might not be the right word. Especially considering one major thing going on ... something that ... well it's hard to describe without spoiling, but it is so far out you will understand what I mean once you see it. Chilling would be an understatement - might leave a mark that ... depending on how much the movie gripped you",Gerald's Game
3,Sleepin_Dragon,"Imaginative, but a bit too slow.",5,17 October 2018,"I really fancied this having watches a trailer, but as is so often the case, the best bits were shown in the trailer, and the film itself was ultimately a disappointment. The writing is clever, the story is best, but as the story is literally handcuffed (no pun intended) it does limit the scope. It's well acted, it's certainly different, I just found it too hard to get into. 5/10",Gerald's Game
4,classicsoncall,""" 'cause everybody's got a little corner in there somewhere.""",7,26 November 2017,"Having recently read ""Gerald's Game"" I still have a pretty good recollection of the book and found this screen adaptation to be very close to the original source. A couple minor points that don't jive would be Gerald's physical health; in the novel he's slightly overweight and not in very good shape, thereby making him a better candidate for a heart attack than a guy like Bruce Greenwood in the role. The other thing had to do with the location of the story. In the book, the house was more like a summer cabin secluded in the woods, whereas this looked like more of a neighborhood type setting. At least that's my recollection, probably more nit-picks than any problem with the screenplay.The movie here is every bit as tense and riveting as the written word, as most of the fear and horror involves a wife, Jessie Burlingame (Carla Gugino), left for helpless after she's been chained to a bed right before her husband (Greenwood) keels over from a massive heart attack. What was intended as a sexual role play turns into a battle for survival and control of one's imagination over all the potential bad things that could happen if someone doesn't come by to offer aid real soon. Director Mike Flanagan takes the approach of allowing the captive Jessie interact with Gerald, her father (Henry Thomas), and her younger self (Chiara Aurelia) in various imaginary scenarios which ultimately resurrect the trauma of an early child abuse episode.I have to admit, even though I've overcome a lot of squeamishness regarding physical injury over time, the scene of Jessie freeing herself from the bed had me squirming, to the point I had to get up and grab some apple juice to help the old blood sugar situation. That was just nasty. And lest I forget, that demonic looking German Shepherd looked like he could have gone berserk any minute. He looked more 'Cujo' than Cujo, if you know what I mean.And then, just as with the Stephen King novel, I thought the ending with the history of The Moonlight Man (Carel Struycken) came across as superfluous and unnecessary to the story. It does make sense in the grand scheme of things, especially with Jessie's nightmarish visions, because you didn't know at the time when she was trapped whether he was real or not. It's just that his revelation seems awkward, like it belonged to a different story altogether.But anyway, this is a very good adaptation of a Stephen King story, so if you're a fan, there's something here that won't make you dread an unfaithful treatment of the source material. I can't imagine Mr. King himself being displeased with the film at all.",Gerald's Game
5,BA_Harrison,Carla in cuffs.,6,31 October 2017,"Carla Gugino. In a sexy negligee. Handcuffed to a bed. Consider my interest officially piqued. And while I think that the minimalist plot is a little too slight for a 100+ minute movie, the lovely Ms. Gugino makes it a more than reasonable way to pass the time, not just because she looks great, but also because she puts in one hell of a performance.Based on a novel by Stephen King, the film sees a married couple, Jessie and Gerald Burlingame (Gugino and Bruce Greenwood), travel to a remote woodland house for the weekend, where they hope to spice up their love life with a little bondage. Unfortunately for Jessie, no sooner has Gerald fastened her to the bedstead with handcuffs (real ones, not those fluffy ones they sell in Ann Summers—allegedly!), than he drops dead of a heart attack. With no-one around for miles, and the key to the cuffs out of reach, Jessie struggles with her sanity while trying to figure a way out of her predicament.Meanwhile, a stray dog has made its way into the house and starts to eat Gerald, a strange, malevolent figure pays a visit in the night, and Jessie recalls a disturbing childhood incident during a solar eclipse that helps explain why she might be a little flaky.Gugino's bravura performance carries the whole film, her suffering culminating in an eye-watering scene where she is forced to resort to self mutilation in order to escape her shackles. I've seen a lot of gory horror in my time, but this part of the film was genuinely gut-churning and makes me wince just thinking about it.I'm not sure what to make of the film's finale, in which the strange creature that appears to Jessie during the night is revealed to be a serial killer with acromegaly, but it was certainly different.6/10.",Gerald's Game
6,michaelRokeefe,In the name of love,8,3 January 2021,"Based on a Stephen King novel, who wouldn't give this one a chance? After all, Mr. King is not totally a horror writer; he just happens to write about human situations that sometimes travel through some weird, horrible and even paranormal circumstances. Jessie (Carla Gugino) and her husband Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) travel to their remote lake house thinking they can spice up their stagnant marriage. Gerald suffers a heart attack while his wife is handcuffed to the bed. Jessie must fight hopelessly to survive, while being forced to face some of her traumatic past. Creepy, frightful and in-your-face horror. One of the better King adaptations to film and Miss Gugino near perfection.",Gerald's Game
7,grantss,"Okay, but not great",6,20 April 2019,"After an attempt to reignite the passion in their marriage goes awry, Jessie is left handcuffed to a bed in a secluded house with her husband, Gerald, dead. Not only must she break free from her shackles but she must avoid being killed by a wild dog that figures that Jessie is on the menu. Then she starts to hallucinate and reminisce.Based on a Stephen King, the movie contains many horror elements as well as human drama and survival drama elements. The survival drama is reasonably interesting, and is the best part of the film. However, it is not substantial enough to be able to make up the entire movie, hence the need for the human drama side, and the horror side, to a lesser degree.The human drama feels overwrought and often like padding, which, from my previous comment, it is. The horror elements are a bit confusing as they are often products of Jessie's mind, but one part then isn't. This also makes the conclusion quite odd, as it seems to come out of nowhere.Overall: watchable, but only just, and only for the survival-based intrigue.",Gerald's Game
8,neil-476,Effective adaptation,8,5 June 2018,"Jessie and Gerald go to their lakehouse for a little end-of-season R&R which, hopefully, might help out their ailing marriage. Gerald interprets this as offering the opportunity to try out a little experimental bondage, and handcuffs Jessie to the bedhead. This is not to Jessie's liking but before Gerald can uncuff her, he suffers a fatal heart attack. Jessie is cuffed to the bed in a deserted cabin. Deserted, that is, apart from the dog who is eating her husband's corpse. Oh, and the serial killer on the loose.The book, like Misery, takes part largely within the protagonist's head. This presents some problems in terms of adaptation: internal monologues are inherently uncinematic. But Gerald - or, rather, Jessie's personification of him - is given a solid role to play here, because Jessie is not just trapped by her cuffs. We learn that her past, including Gerald, but going back to her childhood also, have trapped her just as effectively as the ill-judged bondage game.And kudos to this film for including the eclipse sequence including the very detailed reference to events in King's linked novel Dolores Claiborne. This sequence is atmospheric, evocative, and necessary: the manipulative emotional blackmail of Jessie's father was, for me, the most horrifying element of a story which otherwise traded on Jessie's claustrophobic powerlessness.There is a little gore and some extremely offensive language, all of which is entirely appropriate. And for a story which is essentially a two-hander, but Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood are first rate.This is one of the better King adaptations.",Gerald's Game
9,morrison-dylan-fan,"""Women alone in the dark are like open doors.""",9,9 March 2018,"Since getting left breathless from seeing Oculas at the cinema in 2013,I've become a big fan of auteur film maker Mike Flanagan,who has had an extraordinary run since sketching out his themes in the 2011 indie chiller Absentia. Pleased to see his take on Ouija surpass the (low) expectations the (non-Flanagan) first one had given it,I was excited to see him play a game with the King of horror.View on the film:Adapting for the first time,the screenplay by co-writer/(with Jeff Howard)editor/ director Mike Flanagan cleverly crosses the horrors of Stephen King,with the themes Flanagan had built in Hush and Before I Go To Sleep.Referencing their past films and King's books in funny asides, (from The Dark Tower nods,to a book that Jessie takes with her being one that a character in Hush was writing) the writers open the remote house to the loss/decay of the suburban family that first became prominent in Oculas, as chilling flashbacks bring to light the childhood horrors that haunt Jessie.Cuffing Jessie to isolated hell,Flanagan takes the abrasive isolating shocks in Hush to a psychological direction, where ""ghosts"" of Gerald and Jessie herself (!) causes the chained to the bed Jessie to question what her real reality is.Unlocking Fantasy for the first time since Before I Wake,King's creation of the slithering "" The Moonlight Man"" (who comes with King's ""Carrie"" newspaper-style clippings) give Flanagan's return to the genre a fittingly macabre edge,via the optimism Jessie feels getting undermined by the stuck in her memory face of The Moonlight Man.Reuniting with composers The Newton Brothers,director Mike Flanagan wisely keeps their score for the final page,to instead work closely again with cinematographer Michael Fimognari in listening to the absolute silence that began in Hush,with the noise of rattling handcuffs against the headboard (made of the mirror from Oculas!), chirping birds and opening doors scoring the nightmare Jessie is locked in.Bringing Jessie's real childhood nightmare to light with an eclipse,Flanagan & Fimognari scramble her brain with simmering,ultra-stylised tracking shots,that surf on burning shots of deep red in Jessie's memories,and calmly span the bedroom for all the ghostly howls holding Jessie on the bed.Joined by James Flanagan and Mike's wife Kate Siegel making their regular cameos, Henry Thomas returns from Ouija 2 to give a horrifically mundane performance as Jessie's dad Tom,which gives Tom's attempt to Jessie feel guilty for his sexual assault on her,an unsettling believably. The other man in her life, Bruce Greenwood gives a wonderfully brash performance as Gerald, whose playful manner Greenwood smoothly turns to aggressively sinister.Left with her own voice being the only company she has, Carla Gugino gives an incredibly expressive performance as Jessie. Allowing the loud screams of hope to fade out,Gugino grips onto the fragmented state Jessie goes into finding the will to face the ghosts of the past and the present,with Jessie becoming determined to beat Gerald's game.",Gerald's Game
10,phd_travel,Sickening,1,21 September 2019,"Not all Stephen King novels are good. This is not fun horror like they used to be. This one is just sickening gruesome stuff. A dog eating a dead body and cutting her own wrist? Just sick.

11,trashgang,weird,7,29 July 2020,"This is not one that is gonna be for everyone. It's a weird flick that plays with you and your mind and that's what it's all about, mindtricking.The story is very simple. Marriage isn't okay anymore so the couple goes to another place to have some sexual fantasy. Handcuffed to the bed. But things go wrong and it's from there that this flick becomes a dark story with a lot to tell from the past.Maybe it's a bit exaggerated towards the end with the grave digger but still worth seeing if you like weird and dark stories. And to end it, there's a bit of gore here and there.Gore 1/5

12,sddavis63,"Superb Stephen King Adaptation, But An Ending I Found Silly Detracted From It",7,10 July 2018,"I will confess that I have never read the Stephen King novel on which this movie is based. Maybe the end is a bit clearer in the novel, but the ending of the movie really kind of left me a bit empty. I was really enjoying this movie up to that last ten minutes or so. I can't say that I had been particularly familiar with Carla Gugino, who played Jessie in this, but I thought her performance was fabulous. The story begins with Jessie and her husband Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) taking a vacation in a remote place in the hopes of resparking their marriage, which had gone dry romantically and sexually. To do that, Gerald had brought handcuffs and handcuffed Jessie to the bed. To that point this really had something of a ""dark comedy"" feel to it; it was humourous in a warped sort of way. But it doesn't stay that way for very long. Jessie wasn't enthusiastic about Gerald's handcuff game, or the rape scenario that he wanted to play out with them, and she eventually objected, leading to a fight between them - during which Gerald dropped dead of a heart attack with Jessie still chained to the bed. Alone, with no one to help her, no food, a hungry dog that had found its way into the house and was feeding on Gerald's body and only a single glass of water, she has to find a way to survive. The movie eventually becomes a journey of self-discovery for Jessie as she finds herself exploring the demons in her own past back to her childhood and her relationship with her father and how they connect with the present.This is really well done, and it includes a few scenes that are absolutely cringe-worthy. I actually had to turn away from the screen a couple of times. But personally I just thought this fell apart a bit with the ending. I didn't like the ""Moonlight Man."" I didn't think the ""Moonlight Man"" was really necessary to the story. The dog and just the situation seemed quite sufficient to make this a thoroughly superb horror movie and, to me at least, the ""Moonlight Man"" took a horror movie and turned it into something silly - although that was only in the last ten minutes or so of the movie. I will say that this definitely has a Stephen King feel to it, and up to that last ten minutes I would have said this was superb. But when an ending leaves me dry I end up having to mark it down just a little bit. (7/10)",Gerald's Game
13,Hellmant,"Does a great job of stretching it's seemingly simple story, into a feature length horror movie.",8,3 November 2017,"'GERALD'S GAME': Four Stars (Out of Five) Another Netflix horror flick based on a Stephen King novel (of the same name). This one's about a woman who becomes trapped in an isolated lake house, after her husband handcuffs her to a bed and then has a heart attack and dies. The movie was directed by Mike Flanagan, and it was written by Flanagan and Jeff Howard (the duo also previously performed the same duties on the horror flicks 'OCULUS' and 'OIJA: ORIGIN OF EVIL'). The film stars Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood. It's received almost unanimously positive reviews from critics, and it was released by Netflix through their streaming site. I agree it's a very effective, and thought provoking horror movie.Gerald (Greenwood) and Jessie Burlingame (Gugino) travel to an isolated lake house; in order to have a private getaway, in an attempt to revive their sex life and save their marriage. Gerald takes two Viagra tablets and handcuffs Jessie to a bed, in order to play out an extreme sexual fantasy of his. Jessie at first reluctantly plays along, but then she becomes highly disturbed by her husband's rapist alter ego. After the two argue about it, Gerald has a heart attack and dies. Jessie then has to battle her own psychological demons, a hungry stray dog, and her troubling past, in order to last days alone (locked up) and survive.The film does a great job of stretching it's seemingly simple story, and very isolated premise, into a feature length horror movie. It's also a really insightful character study; about someone who's had to deal with a lot of abuse, and then is forced to face their inner demons alone. Gugino is fantastic in the lead, and Flanagan once again shows how he has a great talent for directing scary horror movies. The film is yet another win for Netflix!",Gerald's Game
14,FeastMode,my notes,1,26 July 2019,"Super duper boring and useless. not poorly made, but i just didn't care. finished it reluctantly. very symbolism-y and metaphorical. and some very questionable decisions. netflix needs to stop making movies (1 viewing)",Gerald's Game
15,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Impressive adaptation of King novel released 25 years ago,9,22 October 2017,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) and Jessie Burlingame (Carla Gugino) are a married couple who decide to make a weekend getaway to connect with each other on a more intimate and physical level. To further ensure this, Gerald brings along two pairs of handcuffs, which he intends to and does use on Jessie on the bed. Initially comfortable going along with it, Jessie becomes despondent just as Gerald gets aroused. But when he suffers a fatal heart attack, Jessie finds herself stranded, tied to the bed with seemingly no way out, at the mercy of external forces, including the sinister 'Moonlight Man' (Carel Struycker), that threaten to tear her apart.A Stephen King adaptation is always more likely to appeal to me if I've read the book, or the short story excerpt, before hand. Although it's almost certain to be nowhere near as good, there's just something more intriguing and compelling to want to see someone else's interpretation of the novel you have read and had your own conjuring of, to see how closely it matches the presentation that has made it to the screen. Gerald's Game was written by King twenty five years ago in 1992. I read it in about 2001, over fifteen years ago, and at the time would have been dying to see a film version of it. But all the same, in the present day, this has emerged and I still was excited to see it. And, thankfully, writer/director Mike Flanagan's film is no disappointment.The perversely inspired and intriguing concept, that really could only have come from King's twistedly brilliant mind, has as much effect on screen as it does in the novel, and Flanagan creates a wonderfully isolated, eerie atmosphere that suits the mood perfectly. In Jessie's predicament, loud, brash jump scares that permeate so much of what passes for modern horror, are redundant, and so wisely the emphasis is on the psychological, as Jessie lies helpless and goes insane, driven mad by hallucinations of Gerald speaking from beyond the grave, and of herself, as her repressed childhood traumas come to the surface and take effect. Inspired casting also does a great job of keeping things on the level, and all the main cast (who are pretty much all of it!) fit their roles fine and perform perfectly.It's a pleasingly faithful version of King's novel, which I can still remember all these years later, and while I wasn't as excited to see it as I was then, it's no bad thing to wait for something so masterful. ****",Gerald's Game

I read the book years ago, and it was not bad, but far from best of the author, which i really love.

18,Platypuschow,Gerald's Game: A heartbreaking let down,6,24 March 2018,"Gerald's Game is one of my favorite Stephen King books, it's so unlike anything else he's done and I find it an outstanding piece of literature. Upon finding out it was to be a live action film I was excited as I figured it would translate to the screen so well.Well cast with the always excellent Carla Gugino (Who perhaps is at her career best here) it certainly captures the feel of the book, looks great and is a well crafted film so why the low rating?Honestly I find it hard to pinpoint, though the film is solid I found myself underwhelmed. Was it the pacing? Was it too short? What went wrong?Gerald's Game is not a bad film by any means, maybe it was my high expectations that killed it.For those unaware, Gerald's Game tells the story of a middle aged couple who decide to spice up their marriage by taking some time out to get a cabin in the woods. Miles from civilisation the husband decides to handcuff his wife to the bed, only to have a heart attack and die.Now his wife is trapped, handcuffed to the bed and alone. No chance of a rescue, and because of this her thoughts begins to wander. She battles her own mind, the side that tells her to fight and the side that wants her to fail. She must survive a hungry dog that has found itself into the house and another ominous unseen force.Geralds Game is perfectly watchable and may really impress those who haven't read the book.

19,Reno-Rangan,The game that opened the doors from the past to the future.,8,24 February 2018,"From the director known for horror and thriller films. So reading the synopsis I realised it is another thriller. Most likely '127 Hours', 'Buried' et cetera kind. That's where I misunderstood it. It opened in a similar fashion. A middle aged couple decided to sexually exploit on one weekend in an isolated place to restore faith in their marriage. But soon something goes wrong, and the woman ends got trapped in the bed for days. Her fight against the time and other psychological effects, particularly memories of the haunting past breaks loose. It just does not end by revealing, can she makes out of there, but it goes even ahead to detail out, bringing a perfect conclusion to the tale. Of course with full of surprises in the final quarter.Initially, I anticipated it could end up as a decent film. But that exceeded when it reached the end. I really enjoyed. Especially the last few minutes, how beautifully patched all the holes. You know, in most of the thrillers, it simply ends without giving out the exact result. It sometime the viewers have to assume whatever way they want. I don't like that. Occasionally, okay, but not in every film. This is really a great writing. It was originally based on the book of the same name by Stephen King. If you are a literature fan, you surely thinking to check it out and I say go for it.The reception was not overwhelming. They say it was just an above average, but for me, it was fantastic. Not because how it had started out, but how it had all ended up. The actors were great, and that is Carla Gugino solely did that. Almost 90 per cent of the film had just two characters. And then there's a flashback, which I think was a fine addition. Following that final five minutes. I think it is a must see if you like thrillers. But my greatest surprise was, it had a few scary sequences. It was truly better than most of the horror films. The film is one of the best of the year in this genre you could find.8/10",Gerald's Game

21,zkonedog,Tremendously Captures Exactly What The Book Intended To Convey,10,7 October 2017,"There are very few works of art (film, music, literature, etc.) that truly scare me or leave me feeling unsettled. Reading Stephen King's novel ""Gerald's Game"" was one of those rare experiences. This adaptation, directed by Mike Flanagan, expertly captures the essence of that creepy novel and puts it on the small screen. Earlier this fall, I proclaimed ""It"" to be perhaps the best book-to-film adaptation I have ever seen. With respect to that wonderful film in its own way, this one is perhaps even better.""Gerald's Game"" tells the story of Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) & Jessie (Carla Gugino) Burlingame, a middle-aged couple headed up to the lake cabin for a romantic weekend. Right from the get-go, it is clear this is a marriage on the rocks. To spice things up in the bedroom, Gerald brings along some handcuffs that Jessie reluctantly allows to be put on her as she is shackled to the bedposts. But then, the unthinkable happens...Gerald gets a bit too rough, Jessie strenuously objects, and Gerald suddenly clutches his chest and falls off the bed after having a heart attack. This puts Jessie in quite a predicament: alone in a secluded cabin, no one around for days, her husband dying on the floor, and her chained to the bed at the mercy of the elements, her bodily needs, and a meat-hungry stray dog that senses her ebbing strength. The clincher: The Moonlight Moon shows up at night (he is real...or a figment of her imagination?).What makes this such a compelling film is how it is able to to be legitimately creepy while also telling a very smart and relevant story. Jessie's predicament is terrifying in and of itself, but then things become more layered as the film flashes back to her childhood in order to better understand how she came to be in this marriage in the first place. It's such a spot-on glimpse at how past traumas can manifest themselves throughout one's life...until they have to be faced head on (e.g. the situation Jessie finds herself in on that bed). There is not a single wasted scene here, as everything has meaning either to the plot or character development.In all honest, I think ""Gerald's Game"" could be a big stepping stone for Netflix, as this is a movie that could have easily premiered in theaters across the country and made millions. It is not just ""good for a Netflix show"", but rather one of the top films I have seen in quite some time. The fact that Netflix was able to produce something of this utmost quality makes me trust them even more going forward.Thus, even with my high expectations (I loved the book, obviously), this adaptation has quickly cemented itself as one of the top movies I have ever seen. It tells a great story, has wonderful character development supported by terrific acting, and is legitimately unsettling at times even to seasoned cinema fans. If you have a Netflix subscription, this 100% needs to be in your queue.",Gerald's Game
22,TheMovieDiorama,"Gerald's Game behaves much like a prostitute, heavily focused to begin with but then fails to shut up towards the climax.",7,23 August 2018,"That may not be the most appropriate simile, yet it accurately illustrates the well-intentioned promiscuity and rapid downfall of this psychological thriller. Surprisingly, another decent Stephen King adaptation following on from last year's 'It' remake. A couple stay in a remote house for a weekend to rekindle their marriage. What initially seemed to be an innocent sex game rapidly turns into an exercise for survival. A psychologically stimulating thriller that explores the theme of sexual trauma and how suppressing bad memories can slowly degrade your mind into madness. A plot that remains dark, twisted and visceral til the third act, utilising an intelligent narrative structure that seamlessly blends backstory with the main scenario to create character development. Howard and Flanagan's screenplay feels very much like a visualisation of the novel, with extensive one take dialogue sequences that are just as descriptive as the book. Flanagan's astute direction manages to conjure up a few scares along the way, particularly with the ominous ""Moonlight Man"", whilst embedding a few gory scenes for good measure (urgh, that hand scene...). Cugino deserves this film. For me, she is an underrated actress and required an engaging story that would allow her to show off her acting talent. Incredible performance, also wonderfully supported by Greenwood. Unfortunately all good things must come to an end, and the third act creeps on in and whispers ""I'm going to ruin this film for you"". What a mess! Endless narration to nearly tie up any and all gaps that the plot may have conceded to, leaving little to no imagination for the viewers. The scares, suspense and tension were instantly diminished, leaving a bland aftertaste. Shame, as the film that preceded this uninspired conclusion was stupendously exciting accompanied by talents both on and off screen. If anything, it's made me realise to never use handcuffs during sexual shenanigans...or atleast bring pink fluffy ones!",Gerald's Game
23,Fella_shibby,Gugino's acting was terrific. The creepiness of isolation and immobilization perfectly captured.,7,5 November 2017,"Saw this recently on a DVD. Having enjoyed Flanagans Occulus n Hush, (yet to c the sequel of Ouija) i was excited to see this. The film which is based on Kings novel is about a couple trying to save their marriage by spending time at a remote house. Thru trailer itself, v come to know that after handcuffing the wife on the bed, the husband suffers a heart attack leaving the wife tied up with no help near at all. 127 hours scenario? To make matters worse, there is a hungry dog on the prowl. The wife later starts hallucinating n she goes thru the mental trauma remembering her dark past.The film succeeded in capturing the creepiness of isolation and immobilization n the growing dread. The good thing about Flanagan is that he can manage to build up tension n suspense in spite of minimum characters n action. Hush was the best example.

25,southdavid,Total Eclipse Of The Heart,7,25 November 2019,"I meant to watch this adaptation of the Stephen King novel closer to the time that it was released on Netflix, as I had read the novel not long before. But for whatever reason I didn't get around to it at the time, but now, watched through a prism of ""The Haunting Of Hill House"" and ""Doctor Sleep"" the film works like a calling card for Mike Flanaghan's recent Horror characteristics.Trying to resuscitate their dying marriage, Jessie (Carla Gugino) and her husband Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) head to their remote holiday home for a weekend away. Looking to spice up their sex life, Jessie reluctantly agrees to be handcuffed to the bed, at which point Gerald suffers a heart attack. Trapped in place, and unable to get help, Jessie battles threats both real, and emotional, as she tries to escape her predicament.I love Carla Gugino and she's brilliant again in this. Such a vulnerable performance, but also such variation offered by her playing part of her own psyche talking to her. Also, though I accept that it's a showy concept, having her interact with physical embodiments of other characters does help bring to life the inner monologues of the book. I haven't read any other reviews of the film yet, but I imagine that a criticism that shows up is that the film is not scary, which is legitimate. That said, it's not really trying to be, it's better classified as a psychological thriller, rather than a straight horror film. Like ""Hill House"" it's more much interested in horror as an explanation of trauma rather than specifically trying to make you jump, or being creepy.It does have one (I assume practical, though I may be wrong) visual effect that is truly disgusting. The rest of the film is nicely shot, stylishly edited and the dialogue is excellent. So why is the review just positive rather than glowing? The plot is perhaps a little lacking for the runtime and the ending in particular feels a little rushed and too convenient. Definitely give it a chance if you haven't already, but I don't think I'll need to see it again.",Gerald's Game

27,jtindahouse,Made with infinite class,8,30 September 2017,"I've only read a handful of Stephen King novels, but 'Gerald's Game' just so happens to be one of them. I liked the novel without overly loving it. It had a memorable ending, but the story was a little bland for my liking. I've heard people say it's one of their favourite King novels and also heard people say it's one of their least favourite, so it's clearly quite a polarising novel. I was excited when I heard it was going to be made into a movie though. I almost always enjoy King movie adaptions and was very interesting to see how they went about the ending I spoke of earlier. It is very rare that I enjoy a movie more than the book version (almost to the point that I can't think of a single example before now), but this is almost certainly a case of that.When you think of a movie where the plot involves a woman tied to a bed for almost the entire run time, you would think they would scraping the barrel to reach 90 minutes. Instead they comfortable cruise to 103 minutes and it never really feels that stretched out.All the classic traits of King's work are featured. The well, the eclipse etc. Even the vibe just inexplicably feels like it's directly from his work. Director Mike Flanagan has once again done a fantastic job. He really is becoming a sure sign of a quality film.The whole cast was admittedly excellent, but it would have to be said that Carla Gugino carried the film. I wasn't too sure with her casting whether she was right for the role, but she proved me wrong to have any doubts. It would not have been an easy role, you're effectively being asked to carry the film on your shoulders, but she nailed it.I'm really glad this turned out so well. It's a smart, thought-provoking and moving story of survival that actually works better in film form than it did in book form. It's a great time to be a King fan right now, that's for sure.",Gerald's Game

A woman and her husband have a little getaway to try to rekindle their failing marriage and the man handcuffs his better half to the bed. He pops a blue pill and promptly drops dead. Pfizer may have a lawsuit on its' hands here. The following hour and a half are a drag as the woman has long and tedious conversations with her dead husband and with a version of herself.

Jesse struggles with her sanity and her painful past, has she tries to make it out alive, but the question is will she?Carla Gugino really gives it her all has Jesse, I think it was her best performance, when she is handcuffed to the bed and is isolated, we the audience are going through it with her, and also the image of her trying help her is also great. Bruce Greenwood really knocks it out of the park has Gerald and the image of Gerald. He looks like he is having the most fun and you can really see it in his performance. Henry Thomas is great in a small role in flashback scenes has Jesse's creepy father. A great human study of a film, you really great inside Jesse's head, and do it very well.",Gerald's Game

Based on the novel by Stephen King, Gerald's Game was directed by Mike Flanagan.I did not much care for one of the heavier sexual child hood theme's told ; In the flashback segments to Jessie's prey childhood, Henry Thomas is indelibly creepy as Jessie's lecherous father who gerrymanders her paterfamilias fetish when they're watching a solar eclipse. Creep me out in not a good way whatsoever there's absolutely nothing pleasant about this viewing experience. I caution my recommendation of this movie as a whole. Albeit This is actually quite an impressive piece of storytelling. While this dark and twisted story will leave many probably not wishing to finish the movie, there's no denying that director Mike Flanagan has crafted another tense film.Nothing about Gerald's Game would have worked if they hadn't gotten the right actress, and Carla Gugino is spot on. Carla Gugino carries Gerald's Game's small-scale suspense with a career-defining performance. When it works, it's because of Gugino, the rare performer who can suggest victimized despair and empowered triumph. Carla Gugino makes Gerald's Game's palatable.

We now have the filmed version of Gerald's Game whereby a loveless married couple trying to rekindle their union w/a pair of handcuffs soon open the floodgates of calamity & terrifying claustrophobia. Sparsely acted & directed, the film works in fits & starts w/the bedroom scenes near soundless except for the seemingly unending dialogue which paints things a little much the obvious.

40,begob,Extreme therapy,10,22 October 2021,"When a sex game goes wrong, a woman finds herself locked into a deadly fate.If horror has a point, this is it. Stephen King movies often leave me dissatisfied, with the exception of The Shining and Misery - and it's the latter that this story channels, but with greater psychological depth, down to a complete resolution.Even so, I wouldn't have watched this without a recommendation, because the scenario seems limited - she's tied up and helpless, there's going to be lots of screaming and grunting and stretching, with handy implements slipping just out of reach, etc etc. Instead, after a breezy intro the story hits the ground running with good conflict between the husband and wife, and then ... a series of dramatic techniques break the story up and keep us guessing even as the editing accelerates the pace.You can gauge the strength of the storytelling by the logline above, which fits both aspects of the woman's experience, allowing them to resonate into a nicely understated climax. And it's not just a matter of recognizing what happened: in one exchange between the woman and her younger self, she speaks rationally, responsibly only to be cut off - what matters is not so much understanding as paying attention, heeding. The resolution has a touch of the King cheese, but doesn't miss the point of scarred survival after an ordeal that treads the line between ugly reality and a menacing innerworld.Performances are excellent, and although there's nothing unusual or innovative in the production it's all good quality - score, direction, cinematography, editing, effects.Overall: A horror to leave a satisfied smile on your ghastly face.Ps. A youtube review adds another dimension I didn't think of, which relates touchingly to the scene where the younger self looks back to the mother and siblings at the dinner table, their eye contact receding and fading to black. The woman's undiscussed decision not to have children is an act of protection that her mother never carried out - to protect her unborn from the threat she sensed in her husband all along. Again, past and present resonating.",Gerald's Game
41,bkrauser-81-311064,A Fun Little Potboiler,7,4 October 2017,"Gerald's Game stars Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood who play married couple Jessie and Gerald Burlingame. The two hope to rekindle their love life with an exciting weekend getaway, but after a foray into sexual experimentation goes horribly wrong, Gerald is left dead on the floor and Jessie is left festooned to the bed frame by two pairs of handcuffs. Left alone and running out of options, Jessie tries all she can to survive while constantly being tormented by her inner demons.The plot thickens with other complications, but the body of this sweaty soup is provided by themes of past transgressions and sexual violence. Jessie is poked and prodded by the ghost of Gerald who assumes the role of almost every terrible man in her life. This along with elaborate red tinted flashbacks may be the most pointedly epicurean parts of the film but they're also the most interesting as they provide solid characterization.Both Greenwood and Gugino are excellent playing what are essentially different facets of the same character. Gugino's slowly rising desperation is so frightfully real that by the time her mind wonders towards the unthinkable we as an audience are simply enraptured. Greenwood; for the short time he's on screen as the real, human Gerald is great as the quintessentially imposing alpha-male. As a ghost/hallucination, we see a side of the normally formal actor we've always suspected but have just never seen.But of course being a Stephen King adaptation, Gerald's Game can't be complete without the usual clutter. A desperate situation and riveting psychological torture melts into mythological world- building and existential horror complete with overstated ghost, ghouls and deeply nested forces lying in the collective unconscious. The sloppiness and embedded symbolism of these things are forced into the narrative, upping the mystery but never the suspense.I can understand these things being in the book. I've never read it but given King's writing style, the rich elaborations and thick mythologies of his oeuvre channel a unique atmosphere of cosmic horror. The kind perfectly calibrated for sitting anxiously on the bed with only the reading light and the sound of rustling leaves to keep you company.In film however, this kind of atmosphere needs more than the specter of the ""moonlight man"" to really translate. Granted Director Mike Flanagan does a fine job incorporating the fantastical elements by linking them to Jessie's arc, but their mere presence guarantees that the last ten minutes or so land with a big dauntless thud. It's a shame too because everything leading up to those final moments is as gripping as it is biting.Overall, Gerald's Game is a solid entry into the spotty history of Stephen King adaptations. Its story is largely kept taut and suspenseful by Gugino's commanding and visceral performance as well as further bolstered by Greenwood's menace. Granted it may not be as nervy as it could have been but for those looking for something to watch in-between It (2017) movies, Gerald's Game definitely won't disappoint.",Gerald's Game
42,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Gerald's Game""- A fascinating and gripping tale of suspense that takes hold and never lets go despite a shaky and questionable finale...",8,6 October 2017,"From the mind of Stephen King and director Mike Flanagan comes ""Gerald's Game"", a Netflix original movie based upon King's novel that takes a simple and elegant premise and successfully uses it weave a tale of suspense that is among the year's most impressive of surprise treats. And though it might not quite reach the great heights attained by the best adaptations of King's work, Flanagan's fierce and stunning portrayal of a woman pushed to the brink of insanity in a desperate bid for survival is a slick and very satisfying adaptation. And it stands tall and proud among the catalog of films and franchises that Netflix has launched over the past five years.Jessie (Carla Gugino) and Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) are a well-off couple whose marriage has taken a decidedly bad turn, and who are seeking a way to spice-up their life and reconnect a bit. At the suggestion of Gerald, the couple decide to try something new in the bedroom to add some flair to their love-life... bondage and role- playing. Though initially open and allowing herself to be handcuffed to their bed, Jessie soon becomes agitated by her husband's increasingly violent kink, resulting in an argument and Gerald's accidental death from a heart-attack. Now trapped with her dead husband's body and a hungry neighborhood dog who wandered in through an open door, Jessie realizes that she won't be able to get any help, and must do whatever she can to try and escape from her imprisonment. All the while, her mental state increasingly deteriorates from stress and she begins to have flashbacks to her troubled past...At its core, ""Gerald's Game"" is a deceptively complex story that was for many years considered ""unfilmable"" due to its shockingly minimalist plot and lack of characters or settings, and yet, here we are. And it is indeed surprising how director Flanagan is able to make the movie not only work, but thoroughly excel with clever structuring and top-notch performances. It's a film that takes place almost entirely within a single room outside of a few key sequences and flashbacks, and yet it never feels dull nor does it fall into tedium. Flanagan wisely allows us to really get into Jessie's mind, and also adds plenty of entertainment value in seeing her work out potential solutions to her problem. The film also cleverly allows dialog and character development to occur thanks to a rather brilliant device- having Jessie ""talk"" to hallucinations of different characters and people from her life including her deceased husband and abusive father (Henry Thomas), who all represent various pieces of her memory and her mental state. Its an invaluable storytelling tactic that pays off wonderfully, and feels like an organic piece of the puzzle.Gugino absolutely steals the film with a career-defining performance as Jessie, and I would not be surprised in the slightest to see her getting some serious nods in the upcoming awards season. Though I've been a fan of hers for some time, I've never seen Gugino in anything quite like this. She carries the entire film, and covers a range of virtually every emotion possible with an ease and sense of realism that was frankly awe-inspiring. Greenwood is also quite a bit of fun in his role as Gerald, as he is allowed to play the character in several different lights, especially after his death when he begins to re-emerge as a vision seen by his wife. He's both slimy but charming. Sympathetic but unlikable. It's a unique balancing act, and Greenwood nails it. I also really enjoyed the small turn by former child actor Henry Thomas as the deeply troubled and abusive father. He's everything you could ever love to hate, and he does a wonderful job with the role.Unfortunately, there are two issues I take with the film that I feel need to be discussed. And while they don't ruin it for me, I do think they bring the film down a few pegs and are the reasons why I cannot give this a perfect ten despite desperately wanting to. Throughout her ordeal, Jessie begins to see cryptic visions of a figure known as the ""Moonlight Man"" (Carel Struycken), who Jessie perceives to be a personification of her potential impending death and frankly... it's a fascinating idea, but it comes off as just a tad-but silly. Even in a film containing elements like hallucinations, visions and flashbacks, the ""Moonlight Man"" just seems out of place and contrived. And I'm sorry... he looks goofy. He just does. Compounding this is the other key issue- the film's denouement. While I will not spoil this, I can say with some certainty that the final ten minutes could have easily been removed entirely, and frankly, the film would have been better for it. It's tacked on and superfluous, only serving as padding that demystifies the tale somewhat instead of enhancing it.Still, these issues cannot detract from an otherwise entirely stellar and enthralling experience. ""Gerald's Game"" might suffer a few missteps along the way, but I would still give it my highest of recommendations. With remarkable performances, an intriguing story, wonderful characters and top-notch visual direction, you really couldn't ask for more. It's one of the better Stephen King adaptations of the past decade and just a darned-fine thriller in its own right. And so, I give it a very good 8 out of 10. Definitely one to check out this Halloween season!",Gerald's Game
43,fntstcplnt,Gerald's Game (2017),6,24 December 2019,"Directed by Mike Flanagan. Starring Carla Gugino, Bruce Greenwood, Henry Thomas, Chiara Aurelia. (TV-MA)Gugino and Greenwood travel to a remote lake house to try and reignite the spark in their marriage, which Greenwood uses as an opportunity to get kinky with the handcuffs and roleplay; next thing you know, he's keeled over dead and she's chained to the bedposts, trapped, and with no one likely to discover them for several days. Stephen King's novel of the same name hardly cried out for a film adaptation--the lion's share of the book takes place in the protagonist's head--but director/co-writer Flanagan manages to find a way to tell the story in cinematic terms and sheds most of the more outlandish elements of the original text. Still, even at only around 100 minutes, the core concept is stretched thin and the suspense ebbs far more than it builds. The supernatural elements aren't smoothly incorporated either, making the revelation at the end more clumsy (and implausible) than intriguing. Greenwood is good as expected; Gugino is even more impressive, tackling a challenging role and excelling at being the victim and victor both.63/100",Gerald's Game
44,arungeorge13,"Don't know about the novel, but I found Flanagan's crafting to be excellent! [+69%]",7,1 October 2017,"Gerald's Game made me ponder over a lot of things - cases of incest and abusive husbands that fill up our newspapers every day, the event of the solar eclipse, the presence of something sinister (in the dark of the night), and introspection during arduous situations - Mike Flanagan (directing from a screenplay by himself and Jeff Howard, based on a Stephen Kind novel) connects these dots magnificently in a crisp psychological horror-thriller than runs for 105 minutes. Right from the opening shot (of handcuffs being loaded onto a satchel), we sense the oddness. And it doesn't really surprise when the husband (Gerald, played by Bruce Greenwood) dies of cardiac arrest just when a quarrel ensues before the couple proceed to have BDSMic sex (in an attempt to revive their sexual lives) at their remote lake-house, because Flanagan has already mastered the skill of putting his lead character/(s) in uncomfortable situations (Absentia, Oculus, Hush & Ouija sequel). So, I guess the novel was tailor-made for him to direct. However, I should also mention that this movie veers away from the usual ""trapped-person"" conventionalities.Here's a woman (Jess, played by the brilliant Carla Gugino) who's left handcuffed to her bed (yes both hands), unable to even move about. But the movie *actually begins* a little later: a stray dog (whom Jess had fed earlier) walks into the room and bites off a piece of flesh from Gerald's corpse. Then, the hallucinations commence - Jess sees a version of herself, her husband and at times, the story intermittently dives into flashback mode, to the time when she was a little girl, and was vacationing with her parents during the occurrence of a rare kind of solar eclipse.Spoilers should end right about here. One'd wonder by reading the synopsis given on the IMDb page that this one will be another survival thriller on the lines of 'Hush' or 'Buried', but that's not all it is. The mystery around Jess' survival is indeed the spine of the film though there's plenty more to chew on. She discusses with the hallucinatory version of her (dead) husband on what had transpired in the couples' lives, and how they'd slowly drifted apart from each other - the conversation she should've had with him when he was alive and well. Every time the dramatic element kicks in, Flanagan reminds us that this film is as real as it is fictional. Jess will have to stretch herself to keep the blood circulation going, drink water to sustain, and shoo away the dog when it tries to chomp on her.The 'Moonlight Man' was a well conceived addition to the goings-on: a sense of gloom prevails, apparently personifying Death itself. The flashbacks provide extensive character development (in a situation where Jess can do nothing but examine her own thoughts and feelings). The final act is on a different plateau altogether: gorehounds should be pleased, but it somehow didn't strike a chord with me. The narration that followed (revealing a plot-twist) also felt out-of-place for a film that had almost stuck to its old-school storytelling roots. I'd say the movie peaks during those stretches where lines between fantasy and reality begin to blur.Flanagan sees to it that some of the ghastly images that unfold on screen remain with the viewer for a very long time: the Moonlight Man's smile, the color of the surroundings during solar eclipse, ripping a palm open using a piece of glass, the pervasive glances of the dad and the apathetic gestures of the husband..everything leaves a dubious impression.Verdict: Well-executed psychological thriller with a befuddled finale!",Gerald's Game
45,Screen_Blitz,"An engrossing Stephen King tale with cutting-edge twists and shivering thrills, this movie hits the score of an edge-of-your-seat experience",7,26 November 2017,"Stephen King's work has been subject to both ups and downs in the celluloid, some such as 'Green Mile', 'The Shawshank Redemption', and 'The Mist' have been powerfully triumphant, some have been swarmed with the ""meh"" factor, then others such as 'Dreamcatcher', 'Cell', and 'The Longliers' have been severely loathed. Now we have Mike Flanagan, director of 'Oculus', 'Hush', and 'Ouija: Origins of Evil', coming into to bring another adaptation of Stephen King's novel of the same name Gerald's Game. Premiering on Netflix, this film straps audiences in another ride of King's twisted horror methodology with hair-raising twists and thrills to ignite of shivering atmosphere that challenges viewers' expectations nearly every step of the way. When it comes to providing solid scares and nightmare-inducing aesthetics, the results are moderately satisfying with a few attempts that fall flat and an questionable ending. But with Flanagan working behind the wheel, it is safe to say his effort do justice to King's work. So the film is about Jessie (played by Carla Gugino) who takes some time off an spend a weekend with her husband Gerald (played by Bruce Greenwood) at a lake house in attempt to mend their fractured relationship. Upon arriving, Gerald treats Jessie to a kinky sex game involving him handcuffing her to the bed. When he suddenly suffers a fatal heart attack, Jessie is left handcuffed in the bed with no food, water, or anyone in contact to help free her. As the sun goes down, Jessie experiences some supernatural events that lead her into some dark secrets from her past about her father (played by Henry Thomas). The film does not pine as your average survival tale, it is a supernatural one that takes a hostage situation and spins it with a Twilight Zone-esque twist. Mike Flanagan holds a solid patent for splashing viewers with cutting-edge thrills and wringing out surprises from supernatural concepts. His efforts pay off to the events that sketch out how a woman fights for survival when her husband's kinky antics are disrupted by an unforeseen tragedy. The execution in which Flanagan operates not only give both Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood the task of taking on challenging roles, but pay satisfying results to a hair-raising experience that dares to leave questioning every step. When Greenwood bites the bullet, Gugino is pulled into a deeply unsettling world where reality and imagination begin to merge, and the haunting horrors of her past are brought to light. That is when the story explores her past relationship with her father who had a morally despicable conduct, and the scares and thrills tautly dominate the atmosphere before taking horrifically gruesome turn that demands the squeamish to turn their heads. Not all the scares land well and some of the thrills fall short of effectiveness. But one major aspect that never fall short of such is the performance by Carla Gugino who packs pure grit for a role that requires her to carry nearly the entire portion of screen time while left stationary to a confined setting. Henry Thomas does a fair job at gripping us with discomfort as does Bruce Greenwood in his oddly dubious role. Every scene with these two present is bound to tie viewers up for one hell of a chilling position. If you are leaning at the edge of your seat with your hands squeezing the sides, you know each of them are getting the job done. Gerald's Game is an engrossing experience lodged with sheer cutting- edge twists and chilling scares to keep things in rolling in spectacular fashion. It is a film worth indulging in when craving for chilling Stephen King-style scares, but don't expect anything groundbreaking. Going in with a heavy wish list will likely lead to some disappointment if not more.",Gerald's Game
46,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Gerald's Game... is a shame that it's on Netflix.,5,16 July 2018,"Just like Death Note, Gerald's Game is a film that couldn't be released in theaters because it takes a story that just doesn't fit a one-off feature film format. Gerald's Game does have good moments, but the ending is where the film becomes an exposition-ridden slog that becomes the archetypal cliche-ridden Stephen King fest (the IT-mini-series, Children of the Corn, The Lawnmower Man and so on) we've seen again and again.Child abuse? Check. Questionable husband? Check. Tormented woman whose backstory and revelation is shoehorned into the ending of the story? Check. Ominous monster whom we don't know anything about (basically a psychological IT)? Double-check.Bottom-line, I don't think this comes even close to 2017's other Stephen King adaptation: IT. Gerald's Game squanders its potential and the ending's dependence on easily resolving childhood trauma with some ominous being just seemed... unbelievably hokey to me.

48,blumdeluxe,A horror coming true,8,7 November 2017,"""Gerald's Game"" tells the story of a long married couple that goes on a vacation trip to spice up their sex-life. When Gerald, the husband, dies of a stroke after handcuffing his wife to the bedpost, things become dangerous and she has to fight for her life while facing her own psyche.What I appreciate about this movie is that it sticks to realistic scenarios throughout most of its playtime, something that is not necessarily inherent to Stephen King's novels. The scenario makes you think how easy you can find yourself in a desperate situation when unexpected events let you down. Skillfully, the producers let you guess which part of the story is real and what are just mirages. Still, I can understand when some people dislike the end, where very many points come together and create a plot that is, again, a bit beyond what is plausible to happen.All in all this is a good movie that is at some points hard to bear. It is, in my eyes, one of the better adaptions of Stephen King and delivers an interesting experience without being breathtaking.",Gerald's Game
49,gianmarcoronconi,Good,7,20 July 2021,Film all in all beautiful even if not at the level I expected from the very promising beginning. But it's still nice and with a pretty meaningless ending for the purpose of the plote.,Gerald's Game
50,gedikreverdi,A very good SK adaptation,8,25 January 2021,"They are in their house by the lake for a weekend trip by themselves. Gerald took his blue pill and chained Jessie to the bed and had a heart attack and drop dead on her and she pushed her down the bed. The dog she saw while it's eating a roadkill and later served Kobe later on on the front yard started eating his dead husband. The feeling of a Stephen king book was so miraculously captured with the flashbacks to the young Jessie's life. By the lake at the very house her father and she sat at the swing by the lake while the rest of the family went on a boat trip. The father wanted her to take on his lap like they'd do when she was a little girl. She accepted it while watching the sun eclipsed by the moon fully with that home made shade, her father masturbated and she noticed. Then at the bedroom it was so enraging to see the father manipulating his daughter to think it might be her fault as well and if it's supposed to be a secret, it's meant to be forever. Her pregnant mother was oblivious even when her daughter broke the glass in her hand at the dinner table at that night. She fell victim to a man very similar to her father later on. The atmosphere during the eclipse was so mystical. Then at night the moonlight man came over. He was holding a bag full of small bones and some souvenirs and jewels. She didn't believe it was real although there was a huge bloody footprint on the floor. At some point I thought Cujo would eat her too but didn't happen it just licked her foot. The shelf above over which her glass was and with the tag of her slip she made a drinking straw. Then she decided to cut her wrist with the glass shard so that with blood being slippery she could take her hand off the handcuff. It was a very gore scene when she literally ripped open her wrist till her palm and pulled her hand and her skin came off as if she's taking off her glove. She passed out again after drinking some water from the tap and attended to her hand. the dog woke her up and the moon light man was standing at the other end of the corridor. She gave her wedding ring to him and took off. She passed out while driving and had an accident crashing a tree. The people from the house nearby came to the wrecked car. She survived and it turned out that the moonlight man was real and he was arrested because he was a grave burglar, mutilator, desecrator and a killer of several people and raped man which is the good luck for Jessie. The man had a genetic disorder which distorts the way he looks. She attended to the court of the man whose family was also eaten and mutilated by him. And she said to him he looked smaller than he'd look and helped those with similar traumas by telling his story with her father. The feeling when you read a Stephen King novel is perfectly captured with this adaptation although the book had more disgusting details about the backstory of the young Jessie but in the film they just omitted them apparently and Gugini's performance was excellent too.",Gerald's Game
51,aciessi,Bound up.,5,21 September 2019,"Take it or leave it. Gerald's Game is part psychological thriller, part ghost story, and at times it seems better of left in paperback than onscreen. Three scenes in particular, however, are extraordinary. Gerald's heart attack is unexpected and perfectly timed. Young Jessie's interactions with her dad are as tense as any I've ever seen, and are immensely uncomfortable. Finally, the bloody climax of Jessie escaping the handcuffs. So excruciating to watch it almost rivals 127 Hours. The rest is just.. meh. As boring and silly as many of Stephen King's weaker novels. As an adaptation, it does what it has to do.",Gerald's Game
52,rps-2,Disturbing and dreadful,2,15 October 2017,"Gerald's Game offers kinky sex, incest, gore and a liberal sprinkling of the F Word. All the ingredients of good box office! I stuck with it only to see if it could get much worse. (It did!) My vote of 2 is generous, based mainly on some good effects and effective cinematography. But the story is confusing and the characters improbable. This is a tense and disturbing film which is difficult to watch and impossible to enjoy. Horror films can be fun. This one, the product of a dissolute Hollywood and an amoral society is not!",Gerald's Game

56,redrobin62-321-207311,Unconvincing Snoozefest.,5,25 September 2018,"Netflix pretty much had all the right elements in place - beautiful setting, gorgeous cinematography, strong acting from the man who played Gerald, but weak acting from his wife. Unfortunately, the entirety of the film rests on her shoulders, and that's where the flick failed.I'm sure she's a a fine actress, but she didn't portray her angst, her anger, her complete disgust about being chained to a bed while a stray dog ate her husband. She was just non-believable, like she could care less what happened to her. Unfortunately, this translates into the audience not caring a toss what happens to her, either. At one point I didn't care if the stray mutt leaped onto the bed and tore her apart at the jugular veins. They should've tried to get more energy or feeling from the actress. They failed, and this lethargic film failed because of it.",Gerald's Game
57,Patient444,Beautiful film!,8,1 October 2017,"This is a step up from your usual horror NetFlix productions and especially from other Stephen King translations. I mean it was a bomb! And in the good way.So the movie itself has that 127 Hours touch, but far, far better than expected. And without spoiling it to you, I have to say Gerald's Game makes the most of everything. Not one detail is left untouched, the usage of the entire environment, memories makes for a terrific viewing experience. You'll be fed tension, scares, confusion, hope and denial, a beautiful game indeed that you just have to be part of. And let me say one more thing, the ending, that was just brilliant. The cherry on the cake. The cold beer after a long hard day. Simply put: RECOMMENDED!Cheers!",Gerald's Game
58,kjproulx,An Extremely Unsettling Experience,6,23 October 2017,"Quite honestly, it's very rare that a film unsettles me, so this is big of me to say, but I actually had to turn my head throughout my viewing of this film. Now streaming on Netflix, Gerald's Game is the latest Stephen King novel to receive a feature film adaptation, and while I probably won't find myself ever revisiting this movie, it's worth a watch if you can stomach it. Movies like the Saw sequels that have mindless and senseless gore will audience members in laugher, but when a film really brings you into its atmosphere and makes you care about what's happening, the gore can feel very realistic, which is why I caution my recommendation of this movie as a whole. Here is why Gerald's Game is impressively hard to watch. Although it may seem impossible to spoil a movie like this, the over-arching story is actually a spoiler itself. To put it simply, Gerald's Game is about a wife and her husband as they travel to a lake house in order to juice up their marriage. After handcuffing his wife to the bed in hopes of pleasuring her, a series of events lead to her being trapped on the bed, alone. Exploring her tragic backstory, while simultaneously showing her struggles throughout her current situation, there's absolutely nothing pleasant about this viewing experience. This is actually quite an impressive piece of storytelling.While this dark and twisted story will leave many probably not wishing to finish the movie, there's no denying that director Mike Flanagan has crafted another tense film. Helming solid horror flicks like Hush and Ouija: Origin of Evil, I knew that this film was in good hands, even though I truthfully didn't know much about it when going in. Flanagan does a wonderful job in sucking you into this premise, and I believe this easily could've been a very boring idea, even though my experience of this overall film did drag a bit. Although that should be a minor complaint, this aspect is precisely what will keep me from watching it a second time. I'm all for a movie taking its time to tell a worthwhile story, but I found myself bored quite often throughout the majority of the film. By the time the third act had hit, I was still very intrigued with what was going to happen next, but I wasn't as invested. Yes, the conclusion is satisfying, but even for a mere 100 minute runtime, I think it could've been shaved to about 80. From it's near silent score, to great direction, everything about this movie is atmospheric and well-done, but I wasn't sucked into this premise like I wanted to be. In the end, this is a hard movie to recommend, because even though the premise itself is interesting, it's very slow and it has some pretty brutal imagery that I even have issues with, and that never happens to me. Gerald's Game is a nice little thriller that's meant to unnerve its audience, and while it does just that, it's also a tedious experience in my opinion. There isn't much I can say without ruining the movie, but I'll warn you by stating that my description of it is unsettling at times won't even begin to cover it for some people. Overall, this is a well-made film with a solid ending, but I just wasn't invested enough to ever feel the need to watch it again. It's worthy of the praise that it's receiving, but it just wasn't for me.",Gerald's Game
59,Darkside-Reviewer,Another disappointing ending to a Stephen King movie adaptation,5,4 November 2020,"Gerald's Game is a nightmare come true for a lot of people the idea of being handcuffed to the bed by a trusted partner then the unthinkable happens they have a fatal heart attack leaving you trapped alone and afraid with no-one around to hear your desperate cries for help. In Gerald's Game that nightmare becomes a reality for one unlucky wife who finds herself handcuffed to a bed with no food and water with no-one around for miles while being trapped in a room with the body of her dead husband. Time slowly passes bye as she begins her slow decent into madness alone and afraid she retreats inside herself where she discovers repressed memories of abuse and it's not long before her mind begins playing tricks on her as she's forced to confront her past emotional conflicts aswell as the very real ones in front of her.Gerald's Game is the movie adaptation of the 1992 book of the same name written by famous horror writer Stephen King. I originally read Gerald's Game back in 2002 I enjoyed the book a great deal and have read the book several times over the years. My only criticism of the book is that it sadly suffers from the same issue as many of Stephen King's other books, the ending is a huge letdown. I was looking forward to seeing this classic King story in a modern day movie adaptation with the hope that maybe King would rewrite the ending although sadly that wasn't the case.There is a fair amount of blood, gore and injury detail in this movie just a heads up for people who are squeamish about blood and realistic injury detail.I would have given the movie a higher rating but again the ending was a big disappointment I thought but in a positive way I suppose the movie remains pretty faithful to original book.",Gerald's Game

I've never been so bored In my life, it's just a film of some woman tied to a bed. Why didn't she just turn on her side and kick the pole with the bottom of her foot. It should've shown someone accidentally leaving the door open or something because how the hell did the dog magically get in the house. Was the grey guy actually real or not would've loved to have actually know that because there's no way he was actually real but it played off like he was.In conclusion please for the love of god don't watch this painful pile of crap it's a complete waste of time and don't wish it upon my worse enemy.",Gerald's Game
63,Alexander_Blanchett,One of the scariest films in years,7,4 October 2017,"One scary son of a b!tch. Seriously, it takes a lot for a movie to scare me or give me goosebumps but this one managed it. The first film in at least a decade to have such an effect on me. Thumbs up for that pitch perfect scary execution. Sadly the direction by Mike Flanagan was not flawless. I for example wasn't too fond about the scenes when leading character Jessie had the discussions with her conscious. I thought those scenes were sometimes poorly put together. The scary scenes came mostly from the fantastic editing. Acting wise it was good enough. Carla Gugino really played the role well enough and I also liked Bruce Greenwood who really pulls out a terrifying performance that works on many levels. Henry Thomas was okay but can do better and I thought a different actor might have nailed that role better. The film had besides the great editing a very memorable cinematography and fine sound. Flanagan succeeded in creating an undeniable scary and uncomfortable atmosphere which made it easy to identify with Jessie and her hopeless situation. Definitely worth to see for the frights and also for the story that does have many meaningful aspects. Disturbing ride.",Gerald's Game
64,CANpatbuck3664,Gugino and Greenwood Shine in a Tight and Interesting Film,8,24 February 2018,"The book Gerald's Game wasn't one of my favourites from Stephen King and it took a friend's recommendation to get me to watch the movie. To their credit, Mike Flanagan and his team did an excellent job smoothing out the rougher edges of the story. The first thing I want to congratulate them for is that the pace of Jessie's story is sped up dramatically. The book is very introspective, it features a lot of recall of Jessie's terrible past and it drags horribly. This movie picks up the tempo without you losing any of the horror of the situation. You still get the same feeling of terror and sympathy for Jessie without the movie dragging and it improved things dramatically for me.The next thing the movie retools is how much they dip their toes into the trauma Jessie suffered. The book spends an uncomfortable amount of time on the abuse Jessie was subject to from members of her family. Again, I thought the decisions they made around this tense subject helped things drastically. We get what happened and the gravity of it without being extremely graphic about it. You also add in some inventive visual style with the eclipse and it really underscores the drama and the shame Jessie felt.The most faithful part of the movie is the character of Jessie and how Carla Gugino chooses to portray her. Gugino is excellent in this movie, I haven't seen such strong work from her in a while. I don't mean that she's been performing in a sub par way, but she hasn't been given this kind of chance to show what she can do for some time. I also want to pat Bruce Greenwood on the back. One of the big departures from the book is that in the original Gerald's Game, she imagines talking to a couple of different people (her college roommate, her former self, the good wife, her therapist etc.). They re imagine it as her talking largely to Gerald and her former self. Greenwood plays Gerald for both his good and bad side capably and both him and Carla are great together and apart. Chiara Aurelia is good as the younger version of Jessie and Henry Thomas does a suitable job as the villainous Tom.Getting to what I didn't like about the movie (which is very little), I wasn't crazy about the ending. This is a shared criticism with the book, The Moonlight Man is an inherently scary character but how King describes him is bizarre. It was never going to translate to film well and through no fault of Carel Struycken, he comes off as a little goofy in the end. This is a great example of taking the good and cleaving out the bad. Flanagan, Gugino, Greenwood and the creative team improved upon this story and created a memorable thriller. I expected little from this and came away from it pleasantly surprised. I agree with the other user reviews here that this is one of the better Stephen King adaptations we've gotten lately, and I'd recommend Gerald's Game to horror fans enthusiastically.",Gerald's Game

67,ridi-arahan,What doesn't kill you make you stronger.,8,15 July 2020,"What worked:
the plot and the theme of the movie is anxiety provoking. It's kind of slow and uninteresting at parts especially at the middle part of the movie, gets better as it hits the end and the conclusion of the movie. The movie on the deeper level is a psychological thriller, dealing with the childhood trauma and abuse. What I loved, as a mental health professional is the use of defense mechanisms; repression, and the ways these issues are dealt in the movie. It's a metaphorical and symbolic movie .What did not work:
screen time; the length of the movie could have been cut by slicing some parts of the middle half of the conversations. Or maybe the conversations would have been made more appealing. Either way, length could have been cut.Final verdict: recommended, but it's more of a psychological thriller",Gerald's Game
68,danielmanson,Should never have been adapted,3,28 March 2019,"There is no way this book should have been made into a film... it felt dragged out and in all honesty could have been done within 20 minutes.Why didn't she try and escape? Not being funny but them bed poles weren't exactly strong, she literally made no effort to try and get out.I like the premise and the message the film was trying to deliver, but i just felt that it was way too long winded and I just got bored. I wanted her to escape and she's there having a mental breakdown after being trapped for about 10 minutes.The acting was the only saving grace, both roles were done fantastically. But could not save it!
Ps: don't watch it you are expecting a horror (I know it's down as horror genre on Netflix) it's more of a drama/thriller. No scary scenes whatsoever!",Gerald's Game

70,ofumalow,Lifetime movie invades horror movie,5,30 June 2021,"OK, I didn't realize until just now (after I'd seen the film) that this is based on a Stephen King novel. Well, no doubt in 400 pages or whatever he was able to manage enough psychological depth to pull off what ends up seeming pretty heavy-handed and contrived here. ""Game"" has a good premise, and I've liked this director's other movies, but once the central jeopardy kicks in, there's barely any time given to developing its elemental suspense before they start piling on the imaginary figures from her subconscious who advise and/or taunt the heroine during her extreme travail--a lazy fantasy plot device I've always hated. Then it turns out that the story isn't really ""How will she free herself from literal chains"" but ""How will she use this time to free herself from the mental chains of childhood sexual abuse,"" as related in flashbacks. So what you start out thinking will be a thriller instead becomes a confronting-the-past tale of self-empowerment. Themes like incest are trivialized by a context like ""I'm remembering my abuse cuz I'm stuck handcuffed to the bed by my husband who just died of a heart attack."" So while well-acted and directed, this just felt like a case where the earnest dramatic elements canceled out the horror elements, and vice versa. Not a personal best for Mike Flanagan.",Gerald's Game
71,nitzanhavoc,"A truly horrific story, which means all complements to Stephen King",6,1 July 2018,"Let me start off by saying that I intend to keep this pretty short. I have never read the original text by Stephen King, but I know that the excellent and horrific story is his and should therefore not be accredited to the production. It's pretty difficult for me to review a Horror film without focusing mainly on the story, let along films from my favorite Horror genre which in my opinion are successful or unsuccessful based mostly on their plot, i.e. the story. But, let's try.The acting is absolutely excellent by all members of the cast, excellent acting and excellent casting for every character. However, it appears production has really pinched its pennies when it comes to art. Everything fake simply appears fake. The injured hand looks like plastic, the criminal's glowing eyes look amateur and cheap, stuff that without such great and compelling story, characters and acting would have really destroyed suspense of disbelief.Besides that? This is a Stephen King text brought to life, and people who have read it tell me the book is much better. As a film separated from its plot for objectivity's sake - I can only say it's slightly above average. Stephen King fans would probably love or hate it, but I simply feel grateful for having experienced the chilling story (besides the final twist which I find to be redundant and unnecessary), while being very much aware that it's the author who deserves the credit,.",Gerald's Game

This should have been a short movie rather than unnecessarily over-stretched 1hr 30min long movie which at one time starts testing your patience.The acting and cinematography are above average. However, the story and dialogue were dragged horribly. At starting, you might find movie intresting but after some time you may get bored to death. I mean what's the fun of hearing two people talking about their failed marriage for 1 hr 30min? I kept waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen only to find that there was no pay-off.Overall, I will not suggest this movie if you are a horror fan looking for something scary or exciting.

77,jackmeat,Very well done trip into the brink of insanity,7,24 August 2018,"My quick rating - 6,9/10. Certain stories are just not going to work if you can't believe the acting. This would be one of them. I also have to say, at times our lead (Carla Gugino) loses focus, meaning she doesn't come off as believable. While this is a minor gripe, the only real thing that threatens this movie from being great is a seemingly rushed ending. The story centers around a sex game gone wrong, you know, where you handcuff your wife to the bed, in hopes of rekindling that old passion in your marriage, only to be the guy that has a heart attack and dies on your wife. That isn't a spoiler, it is the point of the movie. She must figure out how to get out, or survive being shackled to the bed. To say she doesn't lose her mind is an understatement, and it happens really fast. A bit too fast, but I suppose I can live with that. In her travels through insanity she must confront her own dark secrets from her past and ultimately chose what to do with them, leave them tucked away or confront them. The movie itself is far more psychological thriller than horror and does quite well, albeit rushed, in demonstrating the way she processes the whole situation, in reality, and within her mind. I will not give any spoilers to what thrown in part of the end bothered me so much. I'll leave that part for you. Overall this is a good flick that may have been great with just a little more TLC. As usual, Stephen King comes up with some great material (if you haven't noticed, his stories are being done all over the place, as I am weekly glued to Castle Rock for one example) and although I haven't read this story (which is good so I can't make a comparison) I am sure readers will still appreciate this movie along with non King readers as well.",Gerald's Game
78,themadmovieman,"Exceptionally intense, and an absolute masterpiece of a thriller",9,23 October 2017,"This is a remarkably intense film, managing to create hypnotic thrills and harrowing drama in such a small environment, thanks to incredibly atmospheric directing from Mike Flanagan, a powerhouse performance from Carla Gugino, and an absolutely enthralling story that almost never puts a foot wrong, all of which comes together to make a spellbindingly terrifying but utterly unforgettable watch.There's so much to praise about Gerald's Game, but I think what first deserves praising is Mike Flanagan's directing. Survival thrillers are notoriously difficult to get exactly right, but Flanagan does as good a job as I've seen in any of the genre's most notable movies.Almost the entire film plays out watching Carla Gugino handcuffed to the bed, but in that tiny physical environment, it's exceptional what the film manages to achieve. Flanagan paces the story perfectly throughout, allowing it to be an intense and physically exhausting thriller as we see Gugino attempt to escape her predicament through an achingly slow and frustrating process of trial and error and sheer psychological exhaustion, and yet still keeps you on the edge of your seat with every excruciating twist and turn that the story takes.What's more is that the film has a powerfully eerie feel to it that really adds to its emotional impact. The film's setting at times feels comparable to Hush, a home invasion thriller set in the woods (and also directed by Flanagan), but what Gerald's Game does even better is reinforce that sense of isolation through its deliberate lack of a musical score, as well as the use of a pitch-perfect setting.The lack of music throughout is unnerving enough, particularly in the film's early phase in which Bruce Greenwood and Carla Gugino have a series of incredibly intimidating conversations, but the way that the room in which the story plays out is set up is the icing on the cake. Stuck in the middle of a big double bed, Gugino already appears even smaller and less powerful, but it's the fact that the room feels so barren and lifeless at times, with its secluded positioning in the country house between the forest and the seafront, as well as the ghostly flutter of the curtains by the open window over the course of the whole story.All of that makes Gerald's Game a truly atmospheric watch, and plays a significant role in the incredible emotional power of its story, which is where the film manages to step up to the next level.This isn't just a survival thriller, nor is it just an eerie horror movie, but it's a film with a really deep emotional and psychological pulse, and one that will captivate you entirely from the word go.It's a very difficult film to talk about without any major spoilers, as the main action gets going as quickly as 15 minutes in, however it suffices to say that Stephen King's story features some truly thrilling and unpredictable twists and turns, all of which allow the film to keep breathing new life into itself despite the fact that it's physically sitting still from start to finish.There are times when the film hearkens back to the intense horrors of Misery, but to me there seems to be even more to it than that, often delving into some incredibly deep and emotionally harrowing and traumatic themes that will make you want to cover your eyes at times. However, it's all written sublimely, and you definitely won't be able to take your eyes off the screen, no matter how hard you try.Finally, we come to the real stand-out of the entire movie: Carla Gugino. Her performance is as physically impressive as it is emotionally exhilarating, as she excels in showing her character's extreme exhaustion from being stuck completely alone in this awful situation (something that's also helped by some really excellent make- up work as well), but she also makes sure that the emotional drama remains the central focus of the film by putting in a very distressed and on-edge performance throughout.It's easy at times to get swept up in some of the more gruesome details of the plot, but thanks to Gugino's captivating performance, the main character's emotions relating to both her current predicament and her past emotional trauma, both of which play vital roles in the story, is at the very centre of your focus, and allows you to fall ever deeper into the some of the horrors at play in this spellbinding story.On the whole, I was absolutely blown away by Gerald's Game. If I were to have one complaint, I'd say that the very last ten minutes or so aren't quite the ending that the film deserves, but regardless, it's still an exceptional film, featuring some of the most intense and nail-biting thrills you'll ever see come out of just one room, as well as powerfully atmospheric directing and an incredible lead performance. It's not an easy watch by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a film that will grab you immediately and not let you go until the very end.",Gerald's Game
79,CountJonnie,"Effective, and loyal to the book",7,1 April 2018,"Stephen King proves again he is about more than horror alone. And the movie reflects King's skills and message. Gerald's Game (GG) is about a couple trying to breathe more fire into their life that is without passion. But it is just a new chapter in a story about a woman who is not just oppressed, but allows herself to be oppressed. It is not until she faces her greatest challenge when her husband dies and accidentally leaves her tied on the bed with no chance of escape, that she decides to face her current, past and future fears.Gugino and Greenwood carry this movie that has no action, quite a lot of dialogue, and 100% chemistry. Great acting, great direction and a superb story with an ending that will leave you shaking and asking for more.",Gerald's Game
80,dallasryan,Stephen King's Game: A Great Adaptation,7,3 October 2017,"Gerald's Game is a very good film and it's pretty true to the novel for the most part. Jessie had a lot of thoughts in the novel, and the film found an intelligent way to bring out her thoughts without it being contrived, it was smart. Gerald's Game is a disturbing film (and the novel is even more detailed and graphic, being that much more disturbing, one of King's more disturbing novels), and it's not for everyone. It's a heavy movie dealing with multiple disgusting and heartbreaking issues. I wasn't crazy about the ending in the film, I felt the filmmakers should have done the ending which was in the novel as it was more effective and spoke volumes without really having to say anything. But other than the film's ending it was very well done. Carla Gugino is a fantastic actress, and this is probably one of her best roles to date in playing Jessie. Bruce Greenwood is always good, he's always the actor you know you've seen, but you don't remember him, he's a terrific character actor. And Henry Thomas is terrific as the detested Tom. And I was always curious what Andrew Joubert might look like if he ever came to film, and I would say give casting credit for casting Carel Struycken as Joubert, he was very creepy and true to the character of the novel. A fine film, but not for everyone. Well done to the production and actors. One of the better Stephen King adaptation's you will see.",Gerald's Game
81,patriciogl10,Solid effort.,7,4 December 2018,"I really find it interesting when certain films decide to defy the boundaries and present the viewer with a challenging proposal. Such as a film that occurs in a single location in its entirety, for example Buried (2010) or Phone Booth (2004) to name a few. It is worth mentioning that this film is based on a Stephen King novel; this married couple decide to spice things up, so they go to their lake house in order to reignite the flame. The husband (Bruce Greenwood) has one role playing game in mind, which involves handcuffs. You can tell that there isn't trust between them, as the wife (Carla Gugino) doesn't really look comfortable during the entire film. He handcuffs her to the bed and starts playing a little rough, which she completely dislikes and turns her off. In a key moment, he suffers from a heart attack and lands on the floor, leaving her attached to the bed, with no way of escaping.It is definitely an interesting plot. I liked the way it was carried out; although some aspects felt off to me. Some elements didn't quite fit the whole psychological turmoil. The flashback scenes were done very well, and plus they had a very visually fitting style that represented what Carla Gugino's character was going through emotionally in her state of despair and vulnerability.Overall, I think this is a solid effort. Its moments of tension kept me at the edge of my seat and I really felt I was alone in that room with Carla Gugino, she gave a wonderful performance.",Gerald's Game

Every scene tries to show or explain something, very little time was wasted and it kept the movie flowing quite well. There was a pretty good feel of desperation and the escalation towards the end worked really well.

The film definitely surprised me. I was looking for horror, I got one deep psychological drama with elements of horror. The premise of the film draws on some boredom, however it was far from it. The life of an individual is shown through confrontation with one's own demons. The weights of the painful past and overcoming fears are placed in the main plan of the film, the horror is only there to enhance the impression. And it really boosts it! The tension is present throughout the film and then intersects with some scary scene. I have to admit that I was really scared a couple of times, and I can't remember when a movie really scared me. It is certainly important to single out Carla Gugino who is not only the main heroine but is the heart and soul of this film. She put the whole film on her back in one role, which was by no means easy, I can say that this is her best acting release in her career. Because of the horror and some scenes that weren't easy for me to watch I probably won't be watching this movie again, at least not any time soon.",Gerald's Game

Now,Mike Flanagan has directed Gerald's Game,the film based on Kings famous novel and when I heard this,I was so not happy,I might of mentioned this in my review of Hush but anyway,I was so disappointed,what about ehhhhh? James Wan?! Or something and after pretty much having no choice,due to loving Stephen King,I watched it just there on Netflix. At the start,I thought ""SEEN IT!!!!!!"" Until,the film began to dig deeper and that's when I realized,this and IT are the best King adaptions ever. This film is a brilliant example of the book,it's not like a actress playing her that has no resemblance to the character Jess like say,Lindsay Lohan playing her,this woman fitted the role like peanut butter blends brilliantly with jam and the dude who played Gerald was amazing,he was so intense and for some reason,very nerving. Considering Flanagan,who drags on his films,directed this,it didn't leave me bored out of my mind,I was so excited every minute and every time,this guy would talk about the past,I was just jumping in excitement to see the next flashback from her life.

Even though we are stuck with Jessie in her bedroom, the suspense is so strong that you are paying attention into the most subtle of things.As expected, you won't get as many details in a movie than from a book.

The problem here is the first 20 minutes already tell the story, leaving you to sit through boring memories/drama of the handcuffed woman's life.People are saying the Stephen King book on this was great and i can not doubt it as i have not read it, but what i see is people being incredibly biased to Stephen King novel movie adaptations, the fans still give great ratings to this film, even though it is absolute crap, i hate to see that. The movie feels boring for most of the screen time as you simply can not get excited about what is going to happen next, because we kind of know that nothing is about to happen, because of the setting. But if the movie itself felt boring and stupid to you, wait till the ending, i am absolutely shocked about the way this film ended. This has got to be one of the stupidest and worst ideas in the history of film making, the ending is absolutely horrible beyond belief.Definitely something we all will forget, absolutely nothing clever, funny or extra ordinary about this film. They tried making the woman absolutely delusional to pass the time obviously, if she was just sitting there the whole time it would not even last 20 minutes, would it? But that was also a massive flop, since the delusions were simply not engaging enough for you to care about the plot or the outcome of this film.

89,RhapsodyReviews,"Great Movie, Mediocre Ending.",8,23 September 2019,"Review:
'Gerald's Game' is an American psychological-thriller film directed and edited by Mike Flanagan. It is based on Stephen King's 1992 novel of the same name. One of my favorite horror directors is Mike Flanagan. This movie is very entertaining, tense, well acted, but also a little difficult to watch at times. It's a shining example of what Netflix-backed movies can achieve. A constantly evolving thriller that doubles as the one of the best Stephen King adaptions I have seen in recent years.
The film stars Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood as husband and wife staying in an isolated house during a holiday. When the husband dies of a sudden heart attack, his wife, left handcuffed to the bed during an erotic role play, must find a way to survive, all while battling her inner demons.
All performances were fantastic, but Carla Gugino took it to a whole other level. She was basically in one spot throughout the entire film, but still managed to keep us engaged. You felt sympathetic towards her, even when no worlds were spoken. You could see from her face she is a woman with secrets, regrets and trauma.
After a movie that relied on terrific performances, the ending fell short. It would have been much more impactful if the story was left more opened ended instead of attempting to wrap it up in a short amount of time.
Overall, this movie is still a good film that tells more of the story using imagery and shocking themes rather than outright jump scares. 'Gerald's Game' is a good film that is unfortunately a few steps away from being greatest thriller I have seen in ages.

92,keelhaul-80856,"Cool Concept, but should have just been an episode of Twilight Zone...",3,1 October 2017,"First of all, what is Stephen King's obsession with girls being raped and such? I heard this is in the book version of ""It"", and was featured in the film. 2) I have actually thought about what would happen in an incident such as this, and thought it might make an interesting movie. However, it would have been way more intriguing and horrific if she was found in a vulnerable spot by a neighbor or burglar, or in some other situation. The flashbacks and talking to different spirits or versions of herself were just too lame to fill the entire run time of the film.3) Why didn't she just grind the bed posts down and pull the cuffs off of it, or better yet, push the mattress and springs off the bed and drag the frame out somewhere else. It would be annoying, but surely a better idea than slitting your wrists and waiting around for hours, etc.4) Stephen King is talented, but my God! Many of his ideas are just crap. Contrary to others, comparing this nonsense to epics like ""Shawshank"" and ""Green Mile"" and Darabont-level work, is just an insult to those films. They are light years beyond this cheap, claustrophobic mess. 5) The dog is already eating people after a few hrs? Seems strange to me.6) WTF does the eclipse and the crypt-keeper killer reject from ""The Hills Have Eyes"" have to do with any of this??? Admittedly, I fast- forwarded this crap for a minute or two in a couple places, but watched nearly the whole thing. What in the hell did this dude have to do with anything that happened in the movie and the eclipse? I missed something major somewhere. Yet, if I watched basically the whole thing and still have no clue, I feel that the movie was edited and written poorly. I am still trying to figure out WTF this had to do with anything, and it felt like it was just thrown in at the last minute for no reason. I am still researching to figure out what the hell this all has to do with her molestation and ordeal, other than the fact that he represents all her fears(a tired motif at this point in King's and many other books/films). 7) Decent idea, but executed very poorly. Hot milf as the main character, but felt like I was watching a day time soap at times. I hate movies that are filmed nearly all in one room, with like 3 characters, unless the material is absolutely incredible and the flashbacks take you to more interesting worlds. This fails tragically to do any of that for longer than 45 mins. The whole thing could have been condensed to an episode of Twilight Zone, as it is clearly not a great stand-alone story as a film of this length.",Gerald's Game

94,AnishMisra,Gerald's Game Review,8,12 October 2017,"Gerald's game is a film co-written and directed by Mike Flanagan. The trailer of the film excited me a lot since its a film from a director who has given us some great horror films and also its off a Stephen King book. Stephen King has influenced many of the contemporary filmmakers today.In the end, I was much satisfied with the final product.Plot: Jessie and Gerald go to a secluded home to spice up their romance.Story and direction: Many people have termed this film as a horror one. But I don;t see it in that way. I see this film as more of a psychological drama one. Unless, you have a ghost in the film it isn't a horror one for me, at least. Minutes into the film, I was engrossed. The dog the appears on the road terrified me a lot. Then the scenes where Jessie gets paranoid and starts talking to her dead husband and herself got me hooked to. The possibilities of her getting out and just surviving are talked about in these conversations. I was always feeling the tension for Jess. Then we get to Jess' childhood and the kind of abuse she had during that phase. Another thing to mention is about the continuity. It never felt that there were some 2-3 takes. The whole film felt like it was shot in a single take. This credit is for the editing (Flanagan too was the editor). I was touched by those parts. Then during the final phase of the film, I was engrossed. But some things just happen at the ending which was just awkward. I felt like ""Really"". That was the biggest flaw of this film I would say. It started out on a very high note but the end was not so satisfactory.Performances: Carla Gugino was great as Jess. I was feeling for her in each of the tensed moments on the screen. Bruce Greenwood was also good as Gerald. The different shades of his character were pulled off effortlessly by him. The rest of the supporting cast was good too.Favorite Scene: It would be that scene where Jess' father convinces Jess not to tell a single sole of the abuse. The fear, sadness, tension, etc.. can be seen in Jess' eyes. And then we get a dialogue from the present Jess that he could face her with the lies, but not the truth. That dialogue was just the icing on the cake. We also got to learn more about Jess in this scene.Verdict: Given the budget of the film, I would say I was impressed. Although a few hiccups in the final scenes, but yes it's a decent watch. Mike Flanagan has again proved that he is one of the finest directors out there.I am going with an 8/10.",Gerald's Game

Plot is good, a girl who was abused in childhood and always over powered by her husband gets stuck to a bed in alone place and needs to come out. Metaphor comparing her handcuffs to her actual horrors in life is good.
What horribly went wrong is over dramatism of a good story! The girl has clashes in her head - her and her husband's thoughts out of which her husband is constantly pushing her down and she's pulling herself up. Why and how? 
In adverse situations, people always try to escape and then go manic. Here, it seemed the lady was supposed to enter maniac mode right from the start. 
The father daughter scenes are really bad. I mean they are really low and for no reason she is thinking about them instead of trying to get out.

107,marydm-43470,The power of metaphor,10,8 November 2021,"Carla Gugino puts in an absolutely stunning turn here. And Flanagan as director creates quiet magic fully utilising the power of metaphor to communicate his themes.I don't read Stephen King, and to evaluate the movie that's not really necessary. Novels are one medium and movies are another.And this is a movie's movie. Because it practises the Kurosawa principle that a film as a multimodal medium is best when it balances all the media at its disposal.And Flanagan has managed to do just that. But just to illustrate: The central imagery of the solar eclipse occurring on the screen at crucial points in the central character's development, until her final liberation from the abuse by the males in her life coincides with the end of the eclipse and return to normal light, is brilliantly used to provide narrative, dramatic and psychological cohesion. I hate flashbacks, but the eclipse metaphor makes the ones used here flow so seamlessly, they don't feel like flashbacks.The visuals with the darkness of the house, the eerie red glow of eclipse totality and the final daylight that prevails create hugely appropriate atmospherics and mood, which perfectly match the central character's journey.Many other elements work just as well, but suffice it to say that the device of characters coming out of themselves and addressing themselves is another brilliant technique as the central character explores and questions her existence and essence as a woman.For this is not a movie about marriage and its woes, it's about the fate of women in their relationships to all the men in their lives: fathers, husbands and scary gargoyles of the imagination, all of whom turn out to be real and to have done real damage to the heroine.But only as long as she lets them. Her strength and persistence triumph in the end, and the said males recede into the background impotent and unable to scare her any more. She truly cuts them down to size.There's more authentic ""feminism"" in this movie than all of the ""me too"" and women's liberation movements combined. The power of art when it's not pretentious.Carla Gugino could teach the Streeps of this world what acting can be. She is just a powerhouse, given she's in every frame and carries the entire movie.Don't we just love to be so beautifully surprised by some Netflix productions? The end of big Hollywood studio productions? Good riddance and RIP. There's a new paradigm in town with streaming companies and some of the goodies they deliver are so fabulous, they make old Hollywood with its male tyrant directors sound like amateur hour.An absolutely mesmerising flick, Bravo Miss Gugino, Bravo Mr Flanagan, and twice Bravo Netflix.",Gerald's Game

The rest of the movie concerns her trying to get free from the handcuffs, and thinking about an episode of paternal abuse she had when she was twelve. No, I'm not making this up. That's what this piece of crud is about. Netflix really can't seem to come up with anything decent on its own.

111,alanhowden-86367,Great acting boring story,4,13 September 2021,I watched this because it was billed as a horror movie and it had high reviews. I was also curious about how a movie about a woman handcuffed to a bed could be spun out to 103 mins without feeling unnecessarily padded. I still don't know because this film didn't come close to managing it. The plot was just a mish-mash of her unrelated hallucinations none of which could carry the movie. The only reason I watched this till the end was because the acting from the 2 leads was superb.,Gerald's Game
112,stebird,Sick chick psycho chiller thriller,6,10 January 2018,"For the first ten-fifteen minutes I thought ""Gerald's Game"" was actually going to be some sick porno film, and in a weird way I wasn't far wrong..., well maybe a bit but I was barking up the right tree anyhow. It's one of those films that makes your skin crawl, not many films have the ability to do that to me these days, but ""Gerald's Game"" really did. In a remote cabin in the middle of nowhere, husband and wife played by the semi-famous Bruce Greenwood and Carla Gugino shack up for a weekend of romantic passion, trying to rekindle their dwindling marriage, but all goes wrong in a heartbeat, or should that be heart attack? Yes poor Jessie (Gugino) ends up handcuffed to the bed when husband Gerald (Greenwood) has a fatal heart attack and is unable to free herself, over the course of the weekend Jessie's mental state vastly deteriorates, so much so some seriously strange happenings ensue..., visions of her late husband and visions of herself plague her, so does a stray dog that cannot help himself to fresh meat from Gerald's recently deceased carcass and what can only be described as 'Death' paying her nightly visits. It's a perfect psychological thriller that will freak your mind out whether you want it to or not, claustrophobic and at times cringes you..., I've seen better films but this one may leave you with a queasy stomach. The acting could've been better especially from Gugino, but this doesn't take away from the spectacular premise the film sets out to achieve, and yes it does indeed achieve it; a film best viewed alone and at night for maximum effect, not the best overall but certainly addictive.",Gerald's Game
113,shannen-l-c,Gripping thriller that far exceeds expectations,7,17 February 2018,"The second I saw the trailer for this movie it grabbed my attention purely because I wondered how the hell a 1 hour 43 minute movie could built upon the premise of a woman being handcuffed to a bed. But Gerald's Game proved me wrong. There are so many hidden aspects of this movie that you just don't expect. Carla Gugino's performance as the main character, Jessie, is fantastic and she manages to carry the movie practically all by herself. Jessie's character is slowly dissected throughout and it's living through her struggles - past and present - that keeps you hooked and wanting to watch more. The relationship between Jessie and her husband Gerald is authentic and believable. Even the character of Gerald (played by Bruce Greenwood), who was in the movie for a very short period of time, brought an element of fear and tension to the movie, when his sexual preferences suggest there may be a more sinister side to him. Admittedly, it is slow in parts and there are areas where it starts to drag, but ultimately it's an engaging movie throughout. By delving into Jessie's psyche it has you doubt her mental state and what is real and what isn't, but also allows viewers to form a connection with her and sympathise with her as a character. The ending has a twist that I didn't see coming, which I'm still unsure about. Was it genius or was it silly? I'll let you be the judge of that. Personally, I found it interesting although it didn't necessarily fit right with the rest of the movie. The only reason this gets 7 stars is because of the slow pacing in places, lack of build-up and slightly unsatisfying ending.",Gerald's Game
114,azeemnavarro,Much better than the book,7,2 November 2019,"Mike Flanagan did the unexpected with this film: he managed to take the basis of one SK worst novels and addapt it into something great.
The novel itself has only one good thing going: the premise; wich itself is great but only for a short story, not a 300 page book. Also, the main character sucks hard; and the ramblings on her mind are boring, stupid and drag on for too long.
Somehow, this film manages to cut most of the crap of the book, mantaining the same premise but not that much else.
Carla Gugino gives a passionate career-defining performance, carrying the whole movie by herself... both Bruce Greenwood and Henry Thomas also do a fantastic job, being some of the stronger support characters of a recent horror film.
My favorite aspect has to be the screenplay. It gives the movie a great flow, jumping from present to past much more smoothly than the novel did. The dialogue is fantastic, loved the scenes with the 'dual-characters', being that a very big change from the novel (in the book the aparitions are like 5 crazy woman).
Unfortunately the film is not perfect. As every other Mike Flanagan movie, the cinematography is great, but some scenes look pretty awful and some of them are even out of focus. And also the CGI is pretty awful, would've been better if everything was practical, because the makeup is good.
But the major complaint from everyone is the ending. The last 15 minutes are honestly bad, they feel rushed and don't connect with the style of the movie at all, and don't give the closure the viewer wants.
Still, Gerald's Game manages to break the rule of ""source material>adaptation"" and is one of the best horror movies of 2017. A high 7 for this one, well done Mike Flanagan, well done.",Gerald's Game

So, I was with two friends and we watched the movie on Netflix and I got to say talk about making a film that doesn't do a lot yet captivates you. The graphic content is squeamish and can make you nauseous and the scares are somewhat effective, however my absolute favorite part of the story is the main characters thought process and past. I really enjoyed learning about her even if it is the dark stuff. It builds a character that must do the hard things in order to ecsape. I have two problems and that's the fact that the end gets a little cringey. Her talking to herself was awesome because she was in a state of danger. However at the end when she survives, she speaking to herself while reading and proofreading a letter. Not fun and interesting at all. Aside from that, I really enjoyed this movie. The wrist scene was scary and I actually clenched my wrist whenever I think about it. Again, great movie, and if you're a Stephen King fan you'll love it. 9/10.",Gerald's Game

Between high ratings on my guide and the beginning, the film looked promising.Then everything fell flat fast.What could be more tedious than the angry dissection of a marriage we had zero invested in-after one spouse dies? Or (no matter how good the actress), a glut of whining and helplessness from a character chained to a bed?In Jessie's situation, I would've gone into overdrive trying to free myself from minute one, instead of wasting the first 6 hours just laying there.As in, why didn't she start systematically sawing @ a bedpost w/the handcuff on her stronger hand???Given metal is stronger than wood, maybe she could've weakened it enough over time to snap it.The emotional chains of Jessie's backstory were compelling (esp. her childhood). Did it seem realistic, though, that trapped in a life or death ordeal, she's be further draining herself by plumbing her life's emotional traumas?A mediocre film overall, long before the side plot was neatly wrapped w/a bow.",Gerald's Game

The reason I watched this, and I knew nothing of it beforehand, was because of the occasional nod that came across my social media feed. It's sometimes gets featured in ""hidden gems on Netflix"" or such like.So at a loss of what to watch next, and not really looking forward to a film which had a blurb alluding to sex games (really it makes it sound salacious), I put it on. Give it half an hour I said to myself.It's all very icky to begin with and then the central premise kicks in. From there on in, the film becomes something else. It deals quite a lot with sex (more tipping it's hat to it than actually showing it in any detail) in a number of ways and considers the position the woman finds herself in.Dealing with escape and reconciliation, it uses the precarious nature of her position as a metaphor.I didn't realise it was based on a Stephen King book but I guess, having watched it, you can see it.There are some very squirmy and squeamish moments in this. Times when you have to look away. Some people may find it upsetting and that really is not to do with the blurb of ""sex games"" that attracts people to this film. Something else.I will not say anything more on the plot. Suffice it to say, I am glad I watched this over a number of sittings as at times you need a break. It can get hard going.The ending is conclusive but I'm not sure it needed that neatness. Everything wrapped up.By the end, though, I thought ok I'm glad I watched it.Nowhere near on par with say Shawshank but much much better than the recent Dark Tower.It's a film I would recommend watching but with the caveat that it will deal with some really upsetting things and has moments you have to turn away but, overall, you'll at least feel you watched a decent film.",Gerald's Game
122,salonsoab,Deep and Haunting,9,11 July 2020,"This was such an entertaining film in a way I was not expecting. The imagery is creepy and grotesque, the camera work builds on the suspense, and the acting from Carla is outstanding. However, what stands out the most out of this film is the amount of depth that is hidden under its superficial captive horror plot. The character of Jessie is explained through many different layers, and this situation allows for the audience to experience her constant fight with her own demons and insecurities, and how she has to deal with some trauma she experienced in the past.I was never bored by this, which proves once again there is no need for jumpscares or extreme gore for a horror film to be entertaining.A",Gerald's Game
123,richard-fieldhouse,Creepy and disturbing - but not really in a good way,5,14 December 2017,"Carla Gugino spends most of the film handcuffed to a bed after a sex game goes sour. What she sees, or imagines she sees while she's there is pretty creepy - and there is a little of the gore that you might expect from a Stephen King adaptation, but it's not as extreme as some.In its favour it is true that the film does show well how the situation turns her mind in upon her past traumas. While the hours pass, though, with her still on the bed, practical opportunities and problems seem to be overlooked and we have time enough to consider them because in places the pace is a little slow.A plot twist toward the end felt rather contrived. Perhaps it was meant to revive our interest but it left me feeling a little cheated. So probably worth watching for dedicated Stephen King fans, but otherwise, maybe give it a miss.And a last point that has concerned me regarding a number of films like this one is how the child actors involved are really meant to portray their characters' traumas without being affected themselves by the shadows of those acts. Are we asking a little more than we should?",Gerald's Game

Then out of nowhere a slender man type of person appears and takes her ring! What the heck?

While I acknowledge that everyone has a fundamental right to their reservations, their discontent towards a piece of work are too unjustified to warrant a ridiculous 1 star rating for a very well-made film. The film's premise is very simple which is what makes the rabbit-hole of visual horrors and flashbacks through the eyes of the protagonist so brutal. We are taxed with the discomforting emotion of empathy while we watch this poor woman chained to the bed. It's a drama turned psychological thriller turned bone chilling horror. I mean c'mon people, let's drop the misogynistic nonsense; just because a horror movie centers around a woman overcoming adversity doesn't mean it ""should have been a Lifetime movie"".. grow up!

129,cjs6547,Successfully captures the feel of a Stephen King,7,30 September 2017,"Stephen King is at times a brilliant writer, and most of his novels give a home-bred 70's vibe. There's the presence of raw indecency and rotten attachments right beside the gore, and this movie is very good at portraying that.I started watching this movie expecting to get bored at some point, because Gerald's Game is an odd pick of a novel to make into a film. A lot of the story revolves around the heroine spending hours alone and restricted. In a book, the writer has the freedom to play around with memories and weave them into the present, but was the director going to be able to do that?The answer is, yes, he is, and he does that very well. Kudos to a thoroughly entertaining experience, whether it was the 80's gore effects, the commendable acting of Mr. and Mrs. Gerald, or the shifts from almost comedic to certainly nauseating scenes. The only thing that bothered me was that the cinematography was a bit dated, and nothing creative.

The moment when Gerald's spirit appeared made me lose all the interest. I could not believe that this was going to be a spirits movie, or something like that. It was soooo boring....endless crap with zero tension and zero action and zero anything! Nothing happened. I passed it forward at times, only to watch the ending! But it was even more painfully...the speaker tries to bound all the crap together, but it was total nonsense. Blherk! Thought I was going to have a good time. None of that.

What really kills it though is the major plot device - the main lead character talking to imaginary figures - the narrative is unconvincing and dragged out to the point of painful tedium. This is mixed with flashback scenes which are shallow and unconvincing. Plus a contrived horror cliche character, which is weirdly incongruous. The whole thing is stitched together in a tacky way. The conversations and scenes really don't tell much of a story or develop the characters, or one's empathy with the main character, in any way. There is really not much of a story here at all.

To me it appears that Stephen King was not entirely done with his story on Misery, just that this time around he wanted to view certain angles from a different perspective. While in the 1990 film there was always that glimpse of hope that Annie Wilkes would change her mind. Not this time. The husband lies dead on the floor and there is nobody to interact with. Handcuffed to the bed with very little possibility to move at all, Jessie (Carla Gugino) has a lot of time to face her inner self and one could say that her inner voices are leading her through different stages of consciousness. A very interesting take on mind games and the sheer threat of death. Be it dehydration or influences from outside. Unfortunately this movie is so slow paced, that the entire first hour almost puts you asleep and I found myself not even caring for Jessie's character. For sure it was nowhere near back then when Paul Sheldon was trapped in the bedroom. Artfully speaking this movie has a lot of weight. But is it entertaining from a cinematic viewpoint? Not really.

The last 10 minutes may turn some people off, but those who don't care will enjoy every second of them, as I did. 81/100 (B+)I waited for this film for so long, I'm glad it did not disappoint me. I haven't read the book but I had an idea of what the movie was about and I know Mike Flanagan really well. I really like the way he directs horror movies, Hush was awesome, Oculus is in my all time favorites and Ouija: Origin of Evil was fun. So I was very pumped for this.I was surprised for how fast the first act went. It may seem a small scale movie but Flanagan managed to make this movie entertaining. The first 40 minutes went really fast. So moving on, the performances were really good, Carla Gugino as Jessie carried the entire film, she was perfect from beginning to end.The film has many flashbacks and dreams sequences that I really loved. I was confused at first with the pessimist dead guy ""Gerald"" and the optimist Jessie, talking to the real Jessie. I felt the cringe during those scenes, but then I understood how traumatized and desperate she was in this situation that she started to see this hallucinations.I love Mike Flanagan, he makes us care about the characters and their backstory. The entire eclipse sequence was so beautifully shot, and also disturbing in not a conventional way, I'm also happy to see Flanagan's wife Kate Siegel back in another movie from him even if she had very few minutes of screen time.This movie had an awesome scene in which me and my sister screamed our lungs out (I'm serious). It's one of the most gruesome moments I've seen in a horror movie since Bone Tomahawk (2015). I do not know why so many people complain about the last minutes of the film, I thought the ending was fine and it did not ruin the whole experience, at least for me.So in conclusion, I think this is a pretty good choice if you are a Stephen King or a Mike Flanagan fan. It's a small-scale, well- directed movie. I would have loved to see this movie in theaters. I hope Flanagan continues directing and writing more awesome horror movies. I can't even decide which one is my favorite now! (B+)",Gerald's Game

It's more than that.The movie shows how our deepest fears never leave us - we merely choose not to think about them. But they're there, deep beneath the layers of distraction in us. And when Jessie finds herself trapped to the corners of her bed, death looming around, those fears find their way to the top.Her mind communicates with her in two forms - one being herself in the form of her psyche and the other in the form of her husband- symbolising that part of her thinking which was shaped by her husband's influence on her.They both take her back on a journey that includes the times when she faced incidents that scarred her for life. We realise her disdain for rough sex involves her father. And her mind goes back and forth on she looks at everything that happened. It's like she is finally being forced to think about it. And one such incident from the past gives her a hint to release herself from the handcuffs.

I mean if you want us to believe there's no way she can get out at least make the bedpost metal.I get that the movie is meant to be about her inner struggles, but a lot of the dialogue is just kind of odd (you're made of moonlight? Lol what?). Also, despite making a big deal about the importance of water for her survival, when she finally frees herself she just runs straight for the car grabbing neither water nor food from a fridge we already know is fully stocked.

Yes, there is a Stephen-King-esque twist in the last 3 or 4 minutes that might, possibly, be creepy enough to qualify as horror, but 98% of this movie is about a woman coming to terms with her childhood sexual abuse.

Surreal scenes blur-out into stringent sharp cuts getting you from the dream like reflections to the realistic what-to-do environment. Except the beginning and the ending, up and down it goes - from nightmarish reality to dreamy life-fading state. Or vice versa, I wouldn't know! Brilliantly depicted poetic moments with heavy psychological weight (call it trauma).Maybe to some it will be slow paced at moments. But, I believe those are very much needed to make a viewer reflect upon the main character caught in that hard core situation. Great directing job and script made after a great writing. As put above in a way: to the point where you just don't recognize the transition in between real and imagination. First person narration is as good as it gets and guides one through this great movie. The unraveling ending was cherry on the top. Enjoy!",Gerald's Game

Like many of Kings novels the monsters are always much closer to home and human looking than you would expect as director Mike Flanagan brings together a loveless marriage, child abuse and a serial killer to the tv screen.
I hadn't read the novel so my initial thoughts of an hour and half of staring at Carla Gugino struggling to escape her hand cuffed predicament didn't fill me with anticipation however the interwoven story of her internal thoughts manifested as the bickering couple, a history and coming to terms with child abuse actually allowed me to get through the movie without turning off.

157,jordansteel,How many movies did i just watch?,5,19 December 2018,"The primary element of any movie is the plot and thats where many many makers lose out by small errors which effectively ruins something with good potential and a good cast.
How many movies did i watch here? Its begins with a survival story, then goes to issues from a troubled past and goes a different path in the climax, a total misfit here. The makers may argue that dealing with the demons from her past made her strong enough to figure out the escape. But c'mon guys....this is the last place on earth to sit down and ponder on past demons. Anyone would push and push to find a way out. So maybe she was weak, gave up then developed the strength........nope, doesnt work for me. With hours lost in that position, you only grow weaker and not stronger. There was no other way out. Either go Jigsaw or die.
Overcoming the demons would have worked in some other setting (maybe a hostage situation, where waiting is an alternative) but not here. And the end was a completely different movie altogether.
Good performance by the female lead though. Jut couldnt build up to anything solid. A unique premise, just took the wrong path. The positive reviews imply it worked for some.

It gets worse. Also this may come as a surprise, because the first 10 minutes of the film are actually quite promising, I was thinking it was going to be great. But it is after the first 10 minutes (not long) where you will understand why this story has been deemed one that would be impossible to translate to film.

It gave the audience a more compelling dialogue than someone thinking or talking alone.I found the Moonlight Man extraneous at first but I suppose he represents her personal victory.There are moments of visual horror and a realization that the real horror is a life minimized by trauma, unable to break free from a cycle of negative life choices until resolved, in this case by a greater, more present trauma.",Gerald's Game

What works really well is Carla Gugino in the lead. She was instantly recognisable, but I had to look up her name, as she rarely gets a chance like this. She grabs it with both hands and it terrific in the main role.Overall however, I found the hallucinatory conversations somewhat irritating and it actually wasn't really that suspenseful, which ultimately bought down and an otherwise well-made film.

This was a good watch, actually. But it's one of those movies that you watch once and then don't watch it again. I might watch select parts, but I find it highly unlikely I'll ever sit down and watch it all the way through. I haven't read the Stephen King story it's based off of; I'm not a huge Stephen King fan, although I can't deny his eye for horror. Very rarely do I find myself rooting for the main characters in horror movies (is this counted as a horror movie? I'm counting it), but this film was special. After everything Jessie went through, I was hoping she'd get the ending she deserved. I disliked the inclusion of the grave robber dude. His role in the movie felt stupid and pointless. The fact that they focused so much time at the end on him frustrates me because he was nothing more than a side presence throughout the movie. I'm sure it would make more sense if I read the book, but it's too late for that now. The movie was about Jessie and her problems and her relationships regarding her father and her husband. It wasn't about some deformed, shadow man stealing jewellery. But anyways, I wanted to give Jessie a hug and tell her that everything would be okay, because she went through a lot of stuff. Not killing her, and giving her an ending where she got to walk away and finally give herself the chance to heal, was the only valid ending that could have been chosen, and I appreciate that they went with that.",Gerald's Game

So, so good.The only thing about Gerald's Game that I really didn't like was the inclusion of the moonlight man. It felt unnecessary and it really didn't add any shock factor to the plot either. I just could't get behind the character and I think the movie would've been just as effective without him.",Gerald's Game
171,Skaigear,The climax is quite possibly one of the single greatest scene in cinematic history,7,14 October 2017,"Gerald's Game is psychological horror film written and directed by Mike Flanagan based on the novel written by Stephen King. The movie tells the story of Jessie Burlingame and her husband Gerald and their aim to rekindle their troubled marriage by taking a vacation to an isolated lake house. Once there, Gerald immediately attempts bondage sexual intercourse with Jessie by handcuffing her to the bedframes, but before he can free her, he untimely dies of a heart attack. Now we have an isolated thriller where our heroine must find a way to liberate herself from the bed before she dies of hunger, thirst or insanity. I wondered to myself after watching the trailer, how does a movie about a woman in one location be spread to two hours? I then remembered structurally similar films like Buried and 127 Hours did it by a combination of focusing on the protagonists' struggles to stay alive and flashbacks. I really enjoyed Mike Flanagan previous horror films as I think he has an eye for creepy images and a sense of dread. I believe Gerald's Game might be his best film yet.The movie is not your typical slasher film or ghost movie, but a character study about sexual abuse and overcoming trauma. The meat of the story is Jessie tied to the bed, talking to herself while trying to recall her suppressed memories of a horrible childhood event. A movie like this lives or dies by the performance of the actors and Carla Gugino as Jessie gives one of the best performances of the year. With 90% of the screen time, she needed to carry the movie on her back and she did just that. A lesser actress could have turned the movie from very good to not so good, but Gugino owned the screen at every millisecond. Bruce Greenwood as the titular character also gave a grade-A performance.Technically, the film while reclusive, is excellent. The cinematography made the atmosphere and feeling of being tied up in your room with the house door wide open absolutely frightful. It also uses darkness very well and produced some very disturbing and harrowing images from it, akin to Flanagan's previous films Oculus and Ouija: Origin of Evil. The climax of the film is quite possibly one of the single greatest scene in cinematic history. I almost never turn away from violence in movies, but I had to pause this because it was making me feel so uncomfortable. The way the scene was built up, filmed, acted and of course the amazingly gruesome special effects cemented the clip as a YouTube rewatch favorite.One thing I would point to as a negative is the second act did drag and relied heavily on dialogue exposition. While I find the mystery of Jessie's past to be interesting, the way it was filmed was a bit slow. Not really fault to the filmmakers since that was how it happened in King's novel, but it still could have taken a few more cinematic liberties. The film does employ flashbacks to help the audience escape confinement, but I would have liked to see it used more to give details on other aspect of Jessie's life. Also, it is a shame the movie felt the need to follow the novel to the T with the ending, because if would have been perfect if it ended with the climax and left all unresolved up to interpretation, instead of it being spoon-fed to us with boring narration and a series of never- ending endings.Overall I think Gerald's Game is a very good entry to the psychological horror genre. It was suspenseful and intense, with a fantastic performance from Carla Gugino and a cinematic masterpiece of a climax. There are some problems with the draggy second act and ending(s), but I think the movie still shines through. Those who are fans of horror, survival and stories about overcoming childhood trauma should no doubt watch this movie. I will just dare you to watch it with eyes wide opened.",Gerald's Game

The dialog, the atmosphere and some of the plot points definitely have a Stephen King feel to them (which I mean as a positive). Also, during the second act we learn about an event that happened to our female protagonist when she was a child, which adds a whole new emotional layer to the movie, and gives us another reason to care about her and root for her. In the last 15-20 minutes there is a reveal that I thought was unnecessary, and I can imagine that for some people it might even ruin the movie, but I personally was able to reconcile with it, because I accepted that it was Stephen King's story, and that it was important to him. Also, at the end of the day it didn't change the main message of the movie.All in all, this is a great film, I definitely recommend it to horror fans (especially to fans of Stephen King).

I expected a story where the protagonist is chained to a bed for almost the entirety of it to be even more drawn out, but it's ended up being my favourite movie I've reviewed so far. It's very graphic, but uses that skill well to tell a twisted tale of abuse and trauma, paired with the phenomenal acting from all parties involved, especially the main character.

181,kobrakai-1,IT may not be the only good Stephen King adaptation we get this year after all...,8,2 October 2017,"Gerald's Game was not a movie I had on my radar. I've read some of Stephen King's books, but the story which this film is based on was not one of them. Furthermore, what I had read of the film's synopsis didn't seem to be up my alley. With the positive word of mouth I had been hearing about the film, however, coupled with the involvement of director Mike Flanagan, a man whose previous work (Oculus, Hush) I enjoyed, I thought I would give the movie a chance. I'm glad I did.The movie starts off with a simple enough premise: Jessie and Gerald Burlingame (played masterfully by Carla Gugino and Bruce Greenwood) decide to spend a weekend at their lake house in what seems to be a last ditch attempt at reinvigorating their marriage. Of course, this lake house is quite secluded and if something were to go awry-- as is typically the case in these kinds of movies-- there is nary a soul in sight to lend their aid. So when Gerald's failed attempt at acting out his sexual fantasy leaves his wife in handcuffs, Jessie has only her own wits to fall back on when Gerald suddenly suffers from a fatal heart attack before her eyes.Without giving too much away, what follows is a deeply character driven tale not unlike something along the lines of films such as Buried and 127 Hours, where a great deal of the film is confined to one location while our heroine tries to battle her inner demons along with the very deadly situation she has found herself in. Jessie must use every last resource she can come into contact with, and Carla Gugino must do some rather heavy lifting as this film largely revolves around Jessie and the interactions between herself and the inner workings of her mind played out in front of her. As is the case in this sort of film, Gerald's Game hinges entirely on the strength of its cast, and fortunately Gugino is more than up to the task. As is Bruce Greenwood, who gets his fair share of snappy dialogue and is responsible for some appropriately amusing moments. Though this is a small cast, the few other actors who make appearances in the film are all given enough moments to make a lasting impression as well. Like Andy Muschietti's adaptation of Stephen King's IT, this is a movie that is successful not because it throws buckets of blood and gore at the screen, but because it has heart and characters you quickly find yourself invested in. That said, there is still plenty of haunting imagery here; the worst of it simply relies less on gore and more so on the depravity of man. Gerald's Game rewards those who are willing to allow themselves to enjoy the slow build up of dread and unsettling visuals, as opposed to sudden and cheap jump scares.Any complaints I have with Gerald's Game largely have to do with the epilogue. Being vague, I can only say that the final few minutes felt a little tacked on and didn't really gel with the tone set up by the rest of the movie. It's certainly nowhere near enough to deter me from recommending the film and though I cannot speak to how faithful the movie is to its source material, I must say that this movie now has me quite eager to pick up the book and find that out for myself.",Gerald's Game

184,recklesscow,Occasionally effective but hampered by its sub-genre.,3,19 April 2018,"There have been a litany of films that have, whether for budgetary concerns or artistic liberty, had to make do with mostly one location for the duration of their running time, and they've run the gamut from entertaining (""Devil"") to plodding (""ATM"", ""Phone Booth""). I have an instinctive distrust for films in this sub-genre, as I know it's hard to pull off a script that contains enough moments of inspiration to make the use of mostly one location seem inspired and less of a narrative convention imposed by budget or (less rare these days) novelty. Rare is the film in this sub-genre that offers anything of re-watch value, but ""Gerald's Game"" comes close to surmounting the inevitable trappings of this trope. Unfortunately, close is still...close. It's not a win.I don't imagine myself ever going back to view ""Gerald's Game"" again, despite the fact it does have several positive things going for it: the main actress gives an incredible performance and the ""is he real or is he just a figment of her imagination"" subplot of the Moonlight Man is deliciously creepy in the few brief moments he is utilized. I say I probably won't return to it because, while it was entertaining enough on its first run-through, a re-watch would simply be exposing myself to the same dialogue and psychological analyzation that would undoubtedly get old having to sit through again. Because unless there's constant action or tension most of the way through, that's pretty much all films of this nature CAN rely on to get to feature running time: dialogue. And usually lots of it.Much has been made about a particularly gruesome scene that comes in the film's last third. Yes, it is gruesome, and a word to the wise would be to not watch or show the film to anyone who is in the least bit squeamish when it comes to gore or human anatomy. Personally, I prepared myself for an uncomfortable experience by telling myself doctors see much worse, which made the ensuing assault on the senses somewhat more bearable, although I doubt anyone would truly enjoy such a scene unless they're somewhat depraved (or just a really, really big fan of practical effects).""Gerald's Game"" is often draining and uncomfortable, offering just enough creep factor and psychological tension to make the first go-round worth it...almost.",Gerald's Game

187,pencritical,A Very Rare Movie for me - Here's why,7,9 September 2018,"I don't really know what kind of detail counts as a spoiler so be warned this might have one - but just a vague one. I adore Stephen King. I adore his writing, his sense of humor, his politics, his wit, I even like his dog, the thing of evil. But I didn't like Gerald's Game or the Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon -- terribly boring books. Hey, you can't be perfect, Stephen. You're scary enough already and that is a compliment. So, I watched this anyway and a very strange thing happened. I liked it. I liked it much better than I did the book, which is something that almost never happens. In fact, I can only think of one other time that has happened: The Handmaid's Tale - which is a depressing drivel of a tale that I despise - and yet, I love, love, love the TV show. Usually it's the other way round and I'm sure it is for most people. However this movie brings what I think the book was trying to do into focus and what I missed in the book makes sense now. I'm going to go back and read it again when I have a minute and I'm guessing I'll find more to like this time around. Still not sure about the Tom Gordon book though. Weird stuff that. Baseball and bears, nah. Anyway, give the movie a go, but don't expect your typical Stephen King horror and gunk fest. This one is more internal horror and very much about the terrors of the soul and mind. It's good, but for adrenaline junkies it will move too slowly and it has literally no gore, unless you count a pool of blood and a very hungry dog doing what hungry dogs do. In closing I wanted to give a nod to the great performances by Carla Gugino (amazing) and Bruce Greenwood (he's not only great, but still drool worthy at his age).",Gerald's Game
188,crystalline-46579,Good till the end.,5,20 February 2019,I haven't read the novel but I assume some parts are more fleshed out like the whole moonlight man subplot. I mostly enjoyed this movie but that subplot felt like it was thrown in as an afterthought. If you completely removed it you'd still have a good movie and it wouldn't feel like anything was missing. My only other real complaint is there was a lot of missed opportunities for showing instead they chose to tell which wasnt always as effective. The actress was great at carrying the film. That isnt easy so kudos to her.,Gerald's Game
189,veerleameyaw,Boring,3,22 May 2019,"I love most of the Stephen king movies, but this one is really bad. Basically Gerald's game was filmed in 1 same room during the entire film. It was boring beacause there was no variation during the whole movie.I saw a couple discussing during the whole movie. And a bit of their past. But where was the story and the depth? I watched it for only 10 min. The older movies Stephen king made are way better.",Gerald's Game
190,El_Ingeniero,Probably the best *adaptation* of a Stephen King's novel,8,7 November 2017,"Translating a good book onto the screen is not easy and it is not necessary either. 'The Shining' veers away from the book and it's an excellent movie on its own.However I have to take my hat off before the skill that it takes to make a good movie AND capture the feel of book at the same time.This film does it. I've seen every single one of King's adaptations, including the last ""It"", and my award for 'best adaptation' goes to this one. Cujo is not far off, though - film which is, funnily enough, referenced directly in Gerald's Game.Whether you have read the book or not, you won't be disappointed; but if you have, you'll appreciate the craft put into it... and that includes the delightful little winks at other King's novels.",Gerald's Game

I've known this movie since forever but got to watch it a few days ago. I thought it would be mediocre, and yet I was wrong. The story is beautifully written. I think what it is trying to say is our tragic past maybe wasn't that bad as it seems. They are who we are now. They made us. We overcame them and get stronger. As you know, Jessie's tragic past helped her to break free. Maybe this time you are complaining about life and how messed up it is. But who knows perhaps down the road, you'll thank them.",Gerald's Game
195,frances_farmer0,Interesting.,6,8 November 2021,"I'm not really sure how to rate this movie. The acting was very good. Actually, most aspects were very good. The ending however... I don't know. It seemed to go in a VERY strange direction in the last 10 minutes or so, and I feel you'll either love it or hate it. I didn't care for it myself, which took my rating down a solid notch or two. It's DEFINITELY original, which I can always appreciate.",Gerald's Game
196,ericobnn,People saying this is boring are tools,10,28 March 2020,"Reading some of the reviews, they complain the movie bored them to tears, should only have lasted half an hour, nothing is going on etc. But I couldn't disagree more. These people just have low attention spans. Of course, she's stuck in a bed for almost the whole time, but that's not the point. It's the wonderful script (the dialogue between her and the hallucinations she has of her husband and even herself) that perfectly convey the emotional aspects of being in her situation. I don't like movies with slow pacing where nothing really happens (just read some of my other reviews), but plenty happens in this movie; just in the psychological and character-development arenas rather than the external world. Every scene has a purpose. I did not feel bored once during the entire 1h30m runtime.I think the people complaining are just too used to what ""terror"", sadly, has become nowadays: a jumpscare every couple minutes. This film has none of that, but I was gripped nonetheless by the amazing acting and fantastic storytelling abilities of the script. Give me raw psychological dread over jumpscares any day of the week.I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, and really cannot find a significant fault with it, thus my unusual 10 rating.",Gerald's Game
197,invisibleman-1,Supposedly unfilmable story gets an incredible adaptation,10,29 September 2017,"There are not many Stephen King novels left haven't got a movie adaption yet. Surfing on the wave of the mega successful new ""It"" movie comes such a first timer in the form of Netflix' ""Gerald's Game"".I thought that I would never see a movie out of this story. While similar to ""Misery"" with a desperate character bound to a bed this one is tougher: after fifteen minutes you have only one living character left for almost the rest of the movie (as we see at the end, there are actually two). Now, how can you make an interesting movie out of that? The answer: Carla Gugino, Bruce Greenwood and a terrific script. Jesse begins to talk to an imagined Gerald (Greenwood) and an imagined twin of her who I would call Super-Jesse. The devilish Gerald tries to lure her into sleep, tries to convince her to give up and just wait for death. On the other hand Super-Jesse keeps her focused on surviving.The movie shifts gears when dark secrets from Jesse's troubled childhood are shown in flashbacks. The scenes with the eclipse strongly reminded me of another genius King adaptation ""Dolores"" with Kathy Bates. Henry Thomas plays the father in the same luring and deceiving way as Gerald. Jesse is cursed with this pattern of male dominators, but in the end her past is the key to her future.Finally a real monster appears in the form of the Moonlight Man. I think in the book King called this entity the ""Space Cowboy"", the ""Gangster of Love"" (based on Steve Miller's ""The Joker""). It's the classic monster of our childhood: it hides in the shadows or under the bed and it comes at you at night. For sure it's just imagination, isn't it?The final climax is something that is hard to watch, be prepared ""it's gonna f*cking hurt"".Carla Gugino plays all of this physical and psychological torture absolutely convincingly. Bruce Greenwood is awesome, especially in imagined form. His ongoing monologue about how his and Jesse's dead bodies will be found is fantastic. Chiara Aurelia does a great job as young Jesse.Last but not least I bow to Mike Flanagan. The script, co-written by him, stays very true to the book. There is some gore, yes, but the psychological interplay is much more frightening. The direction and camera work is great, I would say this is Darabont-Level. Hooray, Flanagan will also do ""The Haunting of Hill House"" for Netflix!",Gerald's Game
198,HAPPYMEGHA,Gerald's Game brings us a new form of thriller.,7,22 July 2020,I loved Haunting of Hill House but Gerald's Game was the movie that made me want to see more of Mike Flanagan's work.

We explore her psychological strength and ability to overcome life-threatening captivity and isolation at the hand of her (very) recent deceased husband, Gerald.Jessie's predicament is sudden, immediately horrifying, helpless, and deeply creative. The premise is explored perfectly, taking us deeper and deeper within the main character as her isolation continues. We feel the burden of her secrets and experience her creativity.Clara Gugino is engrossing as Jessie. She's able to convey a wide array of emotions that are fully believable and fit the situation.It's a film about feminity, the impact of trauma, and perseverance with twists and turns you won't anticipate.",Gerald's Game

It lived up to my expectations although at certain points the random conversations did get draggy despite majority of the conversations were required to make the scenes solid and how the MC spiraling down the madness of her own thoughts and dreams. I would suggest watching this with the mindset of being in the MC's shoes and it will really makes you grasp how real and unreal everything our mind conjures up to be, which made up the intensity of the movie. There was no frill and all that matter is how strong your survival instinct is and your ability to stay sane in such situation. Although I must say in a way like the MC, there really was not any comprehension on how certain things fell into place that led to the ending (can't explain much without spoiling) but in reality, real life, it is happening too so why not in movie.",Gerald's Game

With its slightly undermining premise and laughable direction what could have been a suspenseful thriller and look into deep characterization was overplayed and had lack of depth and dimension.There's one scene in this film that stands out, while the rest of it cries out for attention desperately. The end of the film has a weird reveal that does nothing for the story but make you laugh.

211,LWSheffield,Just out of reach...,6,11 October 2017,"**includes spoilers** This is a film about reaching for things which are hard to get, both physically and emotionally. On both counts you find that these ends are reach, but perhaps not by the most desirable means. Jessie's struggle to free herself is quite nicely propelled forwards by ideas arriving through the conversations with her imagined self, Gerald or the flashbacks, and the final means of escape is a teeth-gritting watch that does hark back nicely to the days of more visceral, physical effects. The bump in the road with this film comes with the true narrative behind the 'freedom' Jessie finds not only from the handcuffs, but also from the imposing males that have emotionally stifled her in life. Although this subject is not handled terribly, it doesn't carry enough weight in the relatively short runtime of this film for you to buy in to her new found empowered nature. This is also at odds with the reveal that 'the moonlight man' is actually real - a twist that might not have felt so averse to the tone of the movie if I wasn't presented with the suggestion that he was there to have sex with Gerald's corpse. Gerald however, may take solace in the fact that the dirty weekend he planned was not a total washout.",Gerald's Game

I really had to push myself through the first 40 minutes of the movie. It was very long and drawn out and at the closing scene you can't help but think ""well this whole thing could have been done in an hour"".The story of Gerald's Game is quite interesting, I was intrigued to watch the film just based on the trailer. The acting between Carla Gugino (playing Jessie as well as a hallucinated version of Jessie) and Bruce Greenwood (Gerald) was on point and I believed their story as a couple. The back-and-forth between past (eclipse) and present was done really well. Actor Carel Struycken was superb at being the Moonlight Man, but lost me at the end with the final scene in the courtroom. Also, shout out to the dog in the film - I believed you every second of the movie!All-in-all, a good movie to watch...on a day where you are really focused (get a coffee), and have nothing else more exciting to watch.",Gerald's Game
214,poli-chronis,Good for a low budget film,7,11 April 2020,"The movie is ok. Not breathtaking.

215,tranclix,Tries to be many things at once but fails at being either one of them,4,9 July 2019,"This movie has a good cast and without a doubt, the acting is spot on and definitely praise-worthy. But where this movie movie fails is its trial of being many things at once. I know it is based on a Stephen King novel, but just because a novel carries the name of a world-wide best selling author doesn't means it is a guaranteed super-hit story. This movie tries to fit in a multitude of movie genres. It's got psychological horror. Then it's got supernatural horror. Then it's got crime involved. Then it tries to explore domestic abuse themes. Even then, it wants to come out as a movie with much deeper meaning. (I understand that all three main characters in the movie are suppose to be the personifications of the main character's anxiety, inner voice and fears/phobias.) But last of all - this movie is plain dumb and bad with a terrible terrible ending.Although the plot and idea of the movie is indeed very unique and intriguing, but the story is a mis-match of lots of themes, while completely failing to be a ""master"" of any one of them. On top of that, there are just way too many plot holes and lame things in the movie to ignore.This movie might appeal to people who seldom watch movies and decide to go for one on a weekend or once a month. But for people like me, who take their entertainment very seriously and who watch a movie almost everyday (have watched more than 3000 titles by now), this one fails to deliver and connect. It just goes straight to the ""mediocre, forgetful and trashy"" list.",Gerald's Game
216,DebtotheC,ABSOLUTELY! the best Stephen King book of 3 that I've ever seen made into a film!,9,30 September 2017,"I have read many of King's books; particularly at the beginning of his writing career-long before they started translating his books into film adaptations. When they started doing that, my love for his writing sort of faded because no-one seemed to be able to do what I can do (in my own head) when I read a particularly frightening book. I remember the winter of 1976-7 when I was expecting my 2nd and final child and concurrently reading ""Salem's Lot""--living with only my daughter and ended staying up the entire night to finish it. I recall repeatedly getting up that night and checking the locks on my door and my windows it scared me so much! My infamous and also stupid (only in my middle brother's mind!) saying after reading this book and others has always been ""I can make a better movie in my mind while reading a great and frightening book than I have ever seen actually portrayed in a film"". What can I say other than I was very fortunate in that God blessed me with an exceptionally GREAT imagination! This was particularly true after having seen ""The Shining"", which was an enormous disappointment film-wise to me. I had read the book some period of time before the film was released (of course) and had done exactly what I mentioned earlier (making a film in my mind) while reading it and of course was expecting great things from the film adaptation because of the director Brian DePalma (mostly because of what a great job he had done with King's previous masterwork ""Carrie"" and was SO! entirely disillusioned by the result because I saw none of the best parts of the book portrayed in a TRUE and believable manner. (OF COURSE! and yes, I am totally aware that it can't be true because we are dealing entirely with fantasy here, right?!). Nevertheless, I was so disappointed by this, that I took a LONG off and on break from my devouring of Stephen King books. It just so happened that this film, ""Gerald's Game"" popped up entirely by chance today on my TV screen. I have not even read the book, but rest assured, I will make it a point to do so now. This grabbed me (not literally, but figuratively, of course) by the throat within the first 10 minutes and held me transfixed throughout the entirety of the film. It had me shouting (literally, and much more than once) at the television screen while watching this GEM of a film. The only other film rendering of a King book that I found to hold its own, as well as this one manages to do, was ""Delores Claiborne"" and of course ""Misery"". Having been a child abuse victim myself, you can certainly understand why I might find this example and D.C. as riveting as I do. I even have to wonder why it is that King manages to *GET* the entire female child abuse perspective as well as he does--maybe a close relative or friend suffered in the same manner and was able to find a wonderful listener and confidante in him? Just musing here. At any rate, this was a great rendering of very sensitive film subject matter and I truly loved it. I never knew what a great actress Carla Gugino was and of course, Bruce Greenwood, as always, delivers his ultra-snarky and snaky best as a disgusting excuse for a man. He seems to have that particular ""role"" down to a science. HIGHLY recommend, but def not for the faint of heart!",Gerald's Game

Greenwood was good but I actually thought Carla Gugino was even better. This is a good psychological thriller that provides plenty of suspense and a few chills along the way. At first, at the start of the movie, I thought I was going to disappointed not having more of a backstory. But this movie does a great job providing plenty of details as the movie plays on.

222,salesdavew,True to the book (not necessarily a good thing),6,1 January 2018,"When I read Gerald's Game I was still suffering from the extremely contagious syndrome known as Kingitis. This was ""93"" I believe, and Stephen King still ruled the shelves at Barnes and Noble. So when Gerald's Game came out I, like millions of others, rushed off for my copy. I don't remember if it was the first of his books that left me wanting, but it's second half certainly did. Sort of like the Chicago Cubs in 1969. Things just petered out (there's actually a pun there, for which I apologise) on the back end. 
And so the film goes. If a great novelist cannot figure out how to keep things exciting with just a single character, then a director is in trouble. This would have made a great 30 minute YouTube short horror film.",Gerald's Game

229,JimmyTheFilmCritic,Gerald's Game,10,10 October 2017,"I'm not going to lie, I'm not the biggest Stephen King fan you will ever meet. I've read about eight of his books and only really found three of them to be quite entertaining. Those would be Salem's Lot, The Stand, and IT if anyone is interested and I hadn't read Gerald's Game going into this film. So I wasn't too sure about watching it, but so many people were raving about this film on Netflix, I just had to give it a watch and I'm glad that I did.The film is about a couple trying to reignite their marriage by going away for a kinky weekend. But things take a turn for the worst when her husband Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) has a heart attack and dies. Jessie (Carla Gugino) is chained to the bed with no apparent way to escape and no help for miles around.What makes this film so compelling for me is how it's able to tell a legitimately creepy story, but still be incredibly smart and relevant at the same time. When you think about it Jessie's situation is terrifying in itself, but when you look deeper and discover the trauma she suffered as a child it gives you an understanding as to how she ended up married to Gerald in the first place and it's heartbreaking. It's a glimpse at how past traumas can manifest themselves throughout one's life and how you will always be a servant to them until you're ready to face them head on.Mike Flanagan's did an amazing job with this film with directing and co-writing the screenplay with Jeff Howard. But the film biggest asset is Carla Gugino. Oh man her performance in this film was nothing but breathtaking and amazing. If she doesn't get a Best Actress Nomination at next years Oscars, then The Academy is out of touch with reality. Because she deserves it after that performance, she give in this film. I cannot recommend this film an enough. It's on Netflix go watch it!",Gerald's Game

Neither did their imaginary counterparts. Though certainly an interesting take on storytelling, the concept was not explored enough. The presence of these characters did not add much. Instead, it felt like a gimmick.
I would certainly have liked to see more of the psychological side of the story. The flashbacks woven into her delirious states were in fact the best part. However instead the movie tries to weave in horror as well but fails to make it all come together.Let's talk about the demonic figure. I understand that, without spoiling to much, it very well might resemble an embodiment of her traumatic child memories. But than why did this thing have to turn out as real. The final confrontation felt completely unrelated to the personal journey she made that night. So again. The demon did not add any value to the story. The dog might also have been some kind of symbolic embodiment of death, waiting for her, but it fails to use these ideas to develop a rich horror film.Based on some decent acting, the vage but interesting idea of using traumatic memories to craft this mental, and some beautiful cinematography, I keep it at a 4 out of 10. There's a lot of unfulfilled potential here. Perhaps readers of the book will agree.",Gerald's Game

The film is garbage. That's how it is. Its script is so dumb and doesn't know what it wants to be. It starts as a drama and then turns into a thriller and adventure. The husband handcuffs his wife to the bed to have hardcore sex with her. They get in argument and he dies. Now it's up to the woman to survive while she is tied to the bed while the dog eats his husband's corpse on the floor. After this point the movie is full of fillers. Pacing issues, pointless background stories, hilarious hallucinations and boring dialogues are everywhere. The film has some good moments which prevented me from giving it 1/10 but other than that it's a complete mess. And don't even get me started on dumb ending. As I stated earlier. The film begins as drama then turns into a thriller and adventure. In the end it becomes a horror film. Turns out she was not hallucinating and Ghoul was real all along. Then once she gets out of the bed, as a narrator she explains ghoul's character for several minutes as it the film was all about ghoul. And in the end it turns out that the ghoul was actually a human with some disease that made him look like a ghoul. What is the point of this film? 3/10.",Gerald's Game

253,jordanrossreviews,Gerald's Game was surprisingly more introspective and less gruesome than I imagined.,8,6 October 2017,"Gerald's Game was surprisingly more introspective and less gruesome than I imagined (except one particularly cringe-worthy scene). From a viewer who didn't read the Stephen King novel the film was based upon, I went into the Netflix original prepared to be disturbed. The film doesn't waste time getting you to the meat of the story. From the start Carla Gugino gives an emotionally powerful performance as Jessie – a mentally abused victim struggling to repair a failing marriage - that sets the tone for the rest of the film. The reluctance she shows toward her husband Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) forces you to never sit comfortably as the plot begins to be painted. One of the great strengths of this movie was answering the questions you were going to ask before you asked them. Understanding from the beginning that Jessie was to end up handcuffed to a bed throughout the entirety of the film already had me questioning her inability to escape. As soon as you see her situation play out and begin to think of her options, the writers provided answers as to why that isn't possible in a unique and believable fashion. With the multitude of challenges she has to overcome she is forced to relive her disturbing past, which in-turn must help her overcome her shackled state if she is to even have a chance of surviving.The use of symbolism in this film is constant, but so much so that at times it seems to spell it out for you, or literally tell you. I felt the comparisons between her current situation and her past was a bit too blunt. I would've called for a little less hand-holding and a bit more mystery surrounding the connections that were made between the men in her life. Yet one of the most obvious symbols - the blood- red eclipse – was one that surprised me the most as its representation transforms into a powerful message of strength. The anchor for this film was Carla Gugino and her amazingly powerful performance with a great showing from co-star Bruce Greenwood. The dialogue and thought process that unfolded from the two kept me emotionally entwined in the story and eager to find out what would happen next. Along with fantastic performers, Gerald's Game was made better with the subtlety of the soundtrack and cinematography. I was more impressed at the times where there was no music playing at all, which seemed often and was appropriate. It built suspense and kept focus on the current scene when all the viewers were left with was the disturbing sounds of her struggle. The eclipse as mentioned was a favorite of mine. The deep red ring emphasized the horror of events unfolding, yet transformed with the character and began something greater. Even after the movie was finished I found myself thinking over the message that was left for the viewers to contemplate. It was one that I didn't expect and was glad to see at the same time. Gerald's Game was a fantastic physiological thriller that never had me shaking my head in un-believability. I enjoyed the restraint of music in key moments, and was enthralled by the situation presented. This makes two Stephen King adaptations that have nailed the difficult process of transforming a story from a book to film. JordanRoss gives Gerald's Game:8.1/10",Gerald's Game

None of the plots line up with each other making it so random. The woman could easily have gotten out by grabbing on to the bed post and snapping it, putting her feet on the ground and dragging the bed to the sink (which was apparently in her bedroom??) or trying harder to reach the phone. But instead she spent hours talking to a second version of herself and her dead husband. But why is she hallucinating? Because she went 5 hours without water, oh the tragedy. The beginning of this movie is so cheesy and cringe worthy from the packing scene, to the scene where she literally LEFT HER FRONT DOOR OPEN. And was this an accident? NO! She saw it open and just looked at it. And I still don't understand why there was no one around this whole lake when it seemed like there were many houses. Maybe a mailman? But no. Because that would make the movie end and we couldn't be that lucky could we? And the scene at the end where she literally walks up to the serial killer.

The premise, the reviews and the beginning of the movie all gave me high hopes that unfortunately deflated the longer the movie went on. By the end, it felt like a complete dumpster fire. The ending was the worst ending I've seen in a movie in a long time, and it destroyed a lot of what was enjoyable in the film. I know everyone is praising the actors performances, especially the main actress, but it did nothing for me. That being said, I do still enjoy what this movie was trying to be and I felt like like it had so much potential, which is what makes it even all the more disappointing.

262,tflwerchild,"Unnerving, unexpected and not to be missed!",9,3 November 2017,"Considering how bad I think the official poster looks, I didn't have high expectations. Boy, was I wrong!I was on the edge of my seat, cussing and yelling every five minutes, I even cried, but above all I was unnerved. A feeling I thought I would never experience again from a horror film (not since The exorcist, at least). I believe that that is how a horror film should affect you. And guess what? Not a single jump scare!I do enjoy horror movies, maybe a bit too much, but the thing I've grown to expect from the so called ""best"" is to be entertaining to some degree. I have completely forgotten that they were trying to genuinely scare you. With a few exceptions here and there, horror movies today are cash-grabs taking form in sequels, prequels and adaptations. Now, even though this film is an adaptation, it was masterfully executed. One of the best things was the trailer itself. It underlined the main plot, but it was vague enough to gain my interest and let the film surprise me, unlike most trailers these days.In addition, the acting was phenomenal. I have seen Carla Gugino in a few other films before, but always as a side character. After this, I truly think she should be given the opportunity to be a leading role in an abundance of upcoming films. The psychological aspect was so intriguing, her character developing at the right moments in the right way, as we, the viewers, uncover more and more about her past and about the danger lurking in the present. The only problem I have with this film is the ending. Not so much with how it ended, but with the ambient of it. It didn't quite fit the whole flow of the previous scenes. The character's growth, as (Spoiler!) seen by her note written by and to herself, however, was a nice touch.All in all, I really recommend you watch this movie.",Gerald's Game

269,editionsnl,6.8/10,7,7 December 2017,"*Note: I haven't read the book this is based off, so my impressions are based on the movie only.Plot: 5/10. Promising horror plot. A woman's husband dies suddenly during a sex game, leaving her chained to the bed in their cottage in the middle of nowhere. She must figure out how to survive, and quickly starts having creepy hallucinations. This is a truly scary scenario, and so the movie could have been a lot scarier than it was in my opinion. Overall, I found it creepy at best, and dull in parts at worst. There were definitely some creepy elements – Jessie getting out of the handcuffs, the dog, etc. – but these pretty much exclusively relied on gore. I found the ending extremely weird and out of place, and felt that it could have been better weaved throughout the movie to make it seem less like it came out of nowhere in the end. Characters: 7/10. Jessie was an interesting and well-rounded character, and the flashbacks to her (kind of cliché and predictable) backstory were well-done, as was the symbolism in the plot to reflect her story (eg the handcuffs representing her being trapped in the past, the eclipse). The other characters were very minor, but managed to still be intriguing for the most part. Points off because I found the minor characters to be detrimental to the atmosphere of the story in parts – this would have been significantly creepier with more focus on Jessie being alone with her predicament. Cinematography: 7/10. All right, but nothing particularly creative or that impressed me. I enjoyed that it was shot in kind of a ""vintage"" way. Atmosphere: 9/10. Stayed very true to Stephen King.Music: 6/10. Okay, but not particularly memorable. Overall score: 6.8/10",Gerald's Game

274,tr_zeeon,Feels like there is a layer too many to be fulfilling,5,12 August 2019,"First off, I haven't read the book, so this is about the movie only and please do note that everything after this will contain spoilers.Initially I was very sceptic about the movie but I thought the premise was interesting, so I gave it a shot. It definitely had its moments if you're into metaphors and subtle comparisons that form a red line. Be it dog eat dog world or the fact that the power dynamic between the main character and the dog is again the same as between her and her father or her husband after him. Up until the escape that creates this neat little exploration space where the female role in society is ultimately becoming a woman's personal hell, symbolized by the blood red eclipse and the girl and a woman separated by a well, which is also described in such a way it would fit the assumption that it does in fact resemble the time a girl becomes a woman, getting her first period.Ultimately you could say that the second a girl becomes a woman she is subjected to the male hunting instinct on a very primal level, and like all heroines she again needs to pay the toll in blood to not mature in terms of body but this time in terms of mind to free herself from the shackles that she never really took off, which is of course true for a lot of women.If that had been the movie, the somewhat eerie music together with the nice imagery of the eclipse would have worked in my mind. Had it ended with her crashing the car, I think I would even go as far as to say that it is a decent take on the subject which makes for a somewhat pleasing watch.Unfortunately, the movie didn't stop there. Instead, we are introduced to this weird fella who also looks more than ridiculous in the later scenes who apparently really is a necrophiliac and a complete maniac. At that point I felt like Marketing called and asked to introduce some sort of character you can make an action figure of and that was the best way they could pull that off. In my mind, this character adds simply nothing to the entire movie. Instead, it's even detrimental to that world building I mentioned earlier. We suddenly see this bad guy who does so many twisted and wrong things, which somehow manages to detract from the importance of the bad male behavior explored early in the movie and that managed to make a good point. And not only that, it also works completely different to the ubiquitous power dynamic - the visitor never really takes advantage of her. What was the point in including him then? He really didn't do anything of note. The end is then, as it is often the case, the cherry on top. A completely needless moment of being sassy to show how tough our main character has grown through overcomimg the obstacles against all odds, which then doesn't even line up with the aforementioned power dynamic properly.I think it was a palatable watch but simply due to the ending I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",Gerald's Game

The fact that Jess was already a broken woman but uses that brokenness to her advantage is amazing. If there is one negative thing I have to say about this movie it's that it is a lot more ""drama"" than I expected, because I expected a nail biter and this movie isn't really like that, but it is sickeningly brutal though and that is awesome!It's a MUST WATCH from me.",Gerald's Game

280,emathers-1,Gaping Plot Holes & Kobe Beef,6,28 November 2017,"I hate it when logic is thrown out the window for the sake of a story line. Sci-fi is perhaps my favorite genre and occasionally you find some genuinely solid fare - not this time.Starting from the end, the story leaks water like a sieve - 1) she's driving away from the house in a late model Jaguar - she is blacking out and hits a tree. Does the airbag go off? Of course not, she has to get a broken face and amnesia to make the ending work. 2) Cujo - I mean the dog. Early in the film we see her show sympathy for the stray dog who is munching on some opossum roadkill in the middle of the road - who ran over the opossum? Never mind. Then she feeds the mangy critter some Kobe beef steaks in the driveway, cost of the steaks $200 per steak. Really?OK. Then as she and studly walk into the house we see them not close the door behind them after leaving a questionable dog in the driveway. Would you do that? Oh, and just to be sure we get the message, the director has inserted a quick shot of the door frame and lock to make sure we know the door is still open. Well, if they hadn't left the door open then Cujo wouldn't have been able to get in the house and munch on studly's delicti, or any of the related scenarios involving said canine. 3) In the bed we see her wither away as doctor death looks on from the shadows with his jewelry box. But before that, while she is strong and showing us her muscular shoulders and arms, do we see her try to stand up and get the cuffs towards the top of the bedposts and try to pull the posts together so as to break them? Of course not. Do we see her doing any acrobatics with her legs to try to break the posts? Of course not. 4) We watch as she wedges a shard of glass into the bookshelf and proceeds to slit her wrist and lower hand, and somehow magically because she sliced her wrist, her wrist and hand get smaller and are then able to slide through the cuffs. Really?5) Couldn't she just die in the bed, without Cujo munching on her, while we watch the slow disintegration of her mind in a more realistic way? That is terrifying.But hell, who needs logic when you have a strong story line . . .",Gerald's Game

285,bartloboy,"An amazing adaptation, but not flawless",8,2 September 2020,"Gerald's game is an adaptation of the famous Stephen King book with the same name. This Netflix original film is directed by Mike Flanagan and stars a very familiar cast in terms of Flanagan's other work.Gerald's Game is a story about a couple who look to regain a lost romance by going on a trip together and want to spend the weekend in a house by a lake. After an idea gone wrong, Jessie (Carla Gugino) finds herself handcuffed to a bed with no way to escape. The story then unfolds into Jessie losing her mind and hallucinating, also having paranormal events take place in front of her.There are many pros to Gerald's Game, because overall enjoyed this movie a lot. But that doesn't mean it was flawless. First the pros, this movie is so well directed by Mike Flanagan and it really shows what horror is all about. This movie is scary, creepy and leaves you on edge without ever having a jump scare. There are plentiful moments of horror genius throughout the film that show the genius of Mike Flanagan. The story was fairly great, it was amazing how they manage to make a movie basically set in one room, into some movie that felt like so much more. I never once felt bored this whole movie. The characters were also brilliant, although there are 2 main characters in this movie, the writers do a brilliant job of making you invested into the story and I found myself rooting for Jessie by the end of it.And now the cons. There is only 1 or 2 cons in the entire film. The first one being the ending, the ending wasn't terrible by any means, I just felt it didn't really connect to what the rest of the film was setting up. I actually liked what they did with a certain character at the end, but I felt the whole movie portrayed something else than what that end gave us. I didn't find it bad at all, I quite liked the idea, however I felt it didn't work amazingly to what they were trying to achieve. The only other con was I felt the scenes dragged on a little much in the middle of this movie, but it was rare and not mood changing.Overall the story the Mike Flanagan has managed to tell in a very difficult setting is extremely impressive and the pros of this movie are quite extraordinary. The horror and suspense was amazing and everything involved worth the story was also incredible. Overall I give Gerald's Game 8.5/10",Gerald's Game

288,ModlerDK,Great adaption,7,29 October 2017,"I read Gerald's Game earlier this year. While reading, I found myself being genuinely scared, and not only was it scary, there were also scenes which were so uncomfortable, they were hard to get through. Stephen King creates amazing literature, and this might not be his best work, but it's a very good and frightening book. When I heard they were going to make this into a movie, naturally I was excited but also a bit skeptical. It wasn't going to be an easy book to adapt. But Mike Flanagan does an amazing job with this movie. I love Hush and Oculus, and here he succeeds once again. There is no doubt that this man has a passion for horror. This movie was really good, and the feelings I had while reading the book, I also found myself having while watching the movie. This is a story about a woman forced to deal with her past, a woman who has been put in a horrible situation, and the way you get under her skin in the book, also worked very well in the movie. Not only due to great direction, but also due to great acting. If you expect a horror movie with lots of action from start to finish, this might not be the movie for you. This is a chilling psychological thriller which focuses on the main character and her development. The only minor problem I have is the ending – it feels a bit rushed. But all in all, this is a great psychological horror movie and I really enjoyed watching it",Gerald's Game
289,brucegxbg,so good and more,8,10 October 2017,"Pretty hardcore, by which i really mean beautifully bloody(when it comes to surviving) and worth watching, for more than once i believe.Besides, acting by two is superior, even the dog....(in the movie the notion of ""life support""does sound familiar with something in the Handmaid's tale)",Gerald's Game
290,muhammad-shafiq-siraj,Wasn't as expected but still you can watch it!,5,30 September 2017,"Adaptation of a novel into movie is always difficult and the director has to see lot of things before making such an attempt. From a movie standpoint, the best option for Jessie was to remove the mattress using her feet and then either lift the bed-frame or break it with her feet depending on the strength and lifting options. After doing that, it was all simple - just stand with your feet on the floor and move the bed in either direction - so no need to slit the wrists :). On the other hand, the dog never seemed full and was either eating or trying to eat, in just a span of few hours, or sitting aimlessly in the room. Looks like the addition was just to create more thrill. And, after getting free, the first thing a person is expected to do in Jessie's situation and condition is to call 911 rather drive. Similarly, the inclusion of moonlight man and then doing nothing to Jessie did not match his history which was later revealed in the court.",Gerald's Game
291,her_273,One of the worst movies ever,2,21 January 2021,"The only reason I didn't give this movie the lowest rating, 1, is because I like Carla Gugino, but this movie was sooo bad.
It is about effed up people who were psycho to begin with and only get more psycho as the movie progresses. There are gruesome scenes and traumatic events and that's about it.
I do NOT recommend this movie to anyone. Use your time in a wiser way tgan I have by watching it.",Gerald's Game
292,in-between-the-lines,The first Stephen King adaptation that had me considering picking up the novel.,7,30 September 2017,"Jessie (Carla Gugino) and Gerald (Bruce Greenwood) are a married couple hoping to spice up their sex life by indulging in a salacious weekend away to the countryside. Gerald has the idea to handcuff Jessie to the bed, in an attempt to role play. But things get too rough for Jessie and in the confrontation Gerald has a heart attack while Jessie remains cuffed to the bed. She must now find her way out of an impossible situation, while struggling with her own demons and crumbling psyche.This one-location drama is intermixed with hallucinations; increasingly unhinged conversations with mental manifestations of oppression and fear, flashbacks, memories and nightmares from a difficult past, a husband dead on the floor and...a hungry dog. The film doesn't lose it's pace or feel sluggish, director Flanagan navigates the different elements of the plot with skill and uses almost every visual aspect to create suspension and a constant feeling of unpredictability. A door left open, a wooden shelf, a glass of water, a book, a paper tag, a leather bag and a mangy dog. The skillful execution of an intense third act, both from Gugino and Flanagan, stumbles into the final stretch and falls a bit short in the end, feeling strained and convoluted. And I'm left feeling that the film got lost in the page to screen translation, and wondering if it worked better on paper.I have to admit that the main reason for this flick ending up in my Netflix watch-list was Carla Gugino. Unsurprisingly she delivers a fantastic performance, and tackles the difficult and physically restrictive role dynamically. She gives a stirring and impactful execution of a narrative that has more humanity than most horror films at the moment. And even though the film feels a bit clunky towards the end; Gugino's performance, here as well as the rest of the feature, is a big part of what makes it worth watching. (Minor plot point reveal ahead!) As stumbling as the features final steps may be, Flanagan and Gugino work hard to sell it, and Gugino especially; stays on point as she skillfully acts out the unfortunately muddled yet essential message about a woman fighting back against toxic masculinity.",Gerald's Game

This, like all of Stephen King's books, is deeper than it seems.",10,14 October 2017,"The tale uses ordinary circumstances about a horribly common life, to show the brutal, manipulative nature of human beings. Small lines about the incident isolated her for nearly her entire life, and each line her abuser says ""maybe it was the eclipse"" - disavowing responsibility, ""you can't tell anyone next week or 10 years from now"" securing her silence for short and long term. Beautifully and brutally made to show the violence that abuse survivors endure. The fact that she didn't feel like family anymore, that her job was no longer to be a kid but to be a guardian. And finally, that the people who are supposed to protect you from the monsters, can be monsters themselves. Magnificent and terrifying, for real and imaginary villains.

299,nivesh666,"A tense, terrifying thriller anchored by a career-best performance from its lead",8,14 November 2018,"We meet Gerald and Jessie at a time of crisis in their marriage. We watch Gerald pack for a make-or-break trip to their holiday home in the sticks. Handcuffs are the final item he throws in his bag, hoping that a sex game will spice things up, and rekindle the flame that has long gone out.What follows is lots of set-up, involving a stray dog, some fresh meat, a door mistakenly being left open - that kind of thing. We're told that Gerald has prepared everything in advance, so there will be no maid, gardener or visiting friends to interrupt their fun. Oh, and those hand-cuffs are particularly strong, and soon tethered to bed-posts that are re-enforced.But the sex game almost immediately goes wrong, with an argument breaking out that turns violent. Gerald has a heart attack and drops dead with Jessie still tied to the bed. And all those set-ups start to pay off, the horrors that Jessie experiences physical as her body breaks down and that dog pays her a visit. And mental as she starts to lose her mind via dreams, nightmares and terrifying hallucinations. Gerald who comes back from the dead, both help and taunt her. It's a smart dramatic device, allowing the film to fully explore the misery that has engulfed their marriage via heated conversations and revealing flashbacks.Flashbacks also allow the film to leave the bedroom whenever claustrophobia sets in. Though when Jessie's visions take her back to childhood, and a terrible incident during a solar eclipse, it's so horrific that you'll be wanting to return to that bed in the present. Flanagan rings every drop of suspense out of the situation, turning a glass of water traversing across a shelf into a tense action scene, and shooting an incredibly gory sequence late in proceedings that will live long in the memory. And also have audiences reaching for the sick bag.As well as being creative visually, the success of Gerald's Game is just as dependent on its cast. And mercifully, the film strikes gold on both fronts. Bruce Greenwood - sporting some SERIOUS abs - makes the most of Gerald's expanded role. He's charm personified early on so you can see why Jessie first fell for him. Then layer after layer is peeled away to reveal his true self, and you can see why their marriage is dead. In Jessie's mind, at least.
And Carla Gugino is quite simply magnificent as Jessie. It's a complex role, the character talking to herself for much of the film; tough and ruthless one minute, terrified and confused the next. But Gugino pulls it off, her brave efforts turning Jessie into a horror heroine for the ages.",Gerald's Game

302,jordojsb,Brilliance,10,4 October 2017,"With the two Stephen King adaptations recently released to screen, big and small, i have to say the latter dances all over 'It' without a shadow of a doubt. This deeply psychological and undeniably clever thriller gets into the nitty gritty from the get go and doesn't leave a moment without awesome tension in the air. I watched expecting only a psychological scare, and not a horror aspect, but the presence of the 'Moonlight Man' added a brilliant unexpected dash of classic horror, with an almost vintage Frankenstein look to him. The scares from this character alone were pulled off beautifully and uniquely by Flanagan and certainly miles above any of the cheap jump scares in films nowadays, and still leave me looking over my shoulder in the dark. The simultaneous flashback sequence was hauntingly dark and directed to perfection, and added a wonderful depth to the story-line and the character (played superbly by Gugino, who offered a brilliant insight into her trauma, and proved she is far from past her prime in her career). Overall the cinematography in this film was enchanting and beautiful and distinguished it from many other movies in its genre today, I found myself hanging in the balance along with Jessie during the beautiful elongated shot of the stretching country road. Another distinctive element, which was the complete lack of a musical score, proved that sometimes less really is more. Upon her intensely grotesque and jaw dropping escape, I wondered how they would maintain this standard with another 15 minutes to go, but I was very satisfied with the story-line that ensued. However the only thing that left a bitter taste in my mouth was the very final shot of the film, which I thought could've had a grittier ending compared to the relentless emotionally traumatic roller-coaster the rest of the film had been (take note I haven't read the novel and if its the same ending as that, then fair enough). I just feel if the movie had have ended a frame earlier it would have been the perfect ending, so this takes my rating from a 9 or even 10 down to an 8 (harsh I know). Overall still an amazingly executed and thrilling film, and would recommend to anyone to give it a watch, just maybe not alone!",Gerald's Game

I felt pretty misled by the rating which was 6.9 at the time of watching.The premise of the movie stoked my curiosity. I wondered how a woman being handcuffed to a bed could play out in a movie-length production since there didn't seem to be much to go on. Well, it's even more boring than you would expect.Don't get me wrong, the acting is not bad and the cinematography was a bit above-average as well. However, the story and dialogue dragged on horribly.At first, watching the interaction between the older couple feels incredibly awkward--and this is good because I think the film is intended to provoke this feeling. It's as if you are invited over to an older couple's house and they break out into an hour-long passive-aggressive fight in your presence. But it just doesn't stop. The characters make obviously stupid mistakes both in their relationship and in their kink-play. Since they make such stupid mistakes it is incredibly hard to relate to them or care about them.I kept waiting and waiting for something interesting to happen only to find that there was no pay-off. Avoid this movie if you are a horror fan looking for something scary or exciting. This movie is entirely a drama with some dark elements so maybe watch it if you are more geared towards that genre.",Gerald's Game
306,dudditslucky7,Contains all the pain and heart of the novel,10,29 September 2017,"Ten out of ten. Other viewers can complain all they want about this film being 'tedious' or 'bland', or slightly missing the mark or opportunity, but I strongly disagree. Makes me wonder if they got the true point of the novel, even. Stephen King is NOT a horror writer, so much as he is a writer of characters and extraordinary events that they go through, and most importantly, he writes about the deep emotional experiences that people endure in their lifetimes here on this earth. He tends to throw in dark elements, to be certain, and some of those are downright creepy, frightening, or straight-up horrific; this does not make him a horror writer. And anyone expecting a horror film here will subsequently be disappointed and, I guess, apparently bored. I was not bored, I was riveted the entire time. It's not easy to do what Mike Flanagan does with this adaptation. He nails the mental struggles and fractured psyche of the main character, Jessie, under the strain of what she faces. He also delivers on the heart of King's story, which isn't the present situation she finds herself in as an adult, but rather, dealing with secrets and ghosts from her past that have haunted her all her life, without her truly even knowing 'til her current situation arises. It's a beautiful novel of pain, suffering, secrets, abuse (on multiple levels, by multiple people), and the struggle to not just survive, but also heal and thrive, if possible. Flanagan's film captures the heart of King's story, and it is beautifully rendered, and many scenes are equally visually stunning. I cried at the end of the movie. Bruce Greenwood and Carla Gugino turn in excellent performances, among the best I've seen from both of them. Henry Thomas is equally and fittingly gross. Very well done. Even younger Jessie, played by Chiara Aurelia, was exacted with nuanced grace and heartbreak. This is just a terrific movie. And I find every scene featuring Carel Struycken to be extremely creepy, so I'm not certain how other reviewers find this movie lacking in creep value. I just can't disagree more. I love this movie, it's instantly and already in my top fifteen, maybe even my top ten favorite films of all time. Well done. I'll be watching this one more than once.",Gerald's Game

318,paollawanglon,A glad surprise,8,25 October 2017,"Gerald's Game made a big impact on me as a teenager venturing into the world of adult horror novels for the first time. It was as interesting as it was uneventful - it's told from the perspective of a woman who finds herself handcuffed to a bed after her husband suddenly perishes as a result of a heart-attack during sex play - and that same uneventful quality made me doubt Mike Flanagan when his film adaptation was announced. Gladly, I was wrong. Mike Flanagan's retelling of the story is especially successful in two points: conveying inner dialogue and making the story current. Instead of relying on flashbacks alone or unnatural monologues, as many directors have been known to do, Flanagan decided to trust his actors' skills and delivered a swift well-paced narrative built around the coming and going of pieces of Jessie's mind, embodied by Carla Cugino herself (who does a great job at performing from multiple points of view) and her fellow cast members. The inclusion of modern technologies such as smartphones in the film is only the most obvious effort made to bring the 1992 narrative closer to a 2017 audience (don't you always ask yourself where their phones are?), but the changes made to the ending really take the cake here (don't worry. no spoilers!). A lazy option would have been to keep the setting in the early 90's (the costume and ambiance are made sure to give a nod to that era); instead, Flanagan gave the story a whole new dimension, by handling Jessie's ordeal in a more delicate way than King did in the original. As far as adaptations go, it is truly a faithful one. Apart from the details I mentioned before, it does not differ from King's original. If you enjoyed the book, you will certainly like the film. However, if you only know King by his reputation - or the gorier adaptations of his work, like Christine and Carrie - you might be expecting blood, violence and monsters; in that case, you will be disappointed. What we have here is the story of a woman in a world of men - it touches on abusive relationships, child and sexual abuse, self-love and social expectations (keep that in mind when choosing someone to watch it with, as not everyone reacts well to those subjects) - certainly more to the likes of The Shawshank Redemption than The Shining. So much so that some ill-advised individuals who see horror only in (non-metaphorical) spilled guts have described the adaptation as a Lifetime ""chick flick"", due to the lack of gore. To those, I say, as all King fans know: horror is in the mind. It is there, sure, but it is built upon the insecurity and instability of Jessie's psyche and how the events in her life led her to that situation. It is an absolute must-watch.",Gerald's Game

320,stephy122,What a disappointment!,5,3 October 2017,"I read Stephen King's novel several years ago so was really excited to see the film had finally been released.My husband hadn't read the book but I told him it was the best book Stephen King has ever written and to not talk but watch all the way through, getting into the mood of the film.What spoilt it for me was the apparitions of the 2 lead characters, Gerald himself and the very much alive wife Jessie, talking to the her inner self, I suppose. It made us laugh rather than worried about what they were saying. The dog pulling off parts of Gerald's limbs was played down so didn't really shock or surprise as I expected and 'Mr Moonlight' wasn't as frightening as the book at all.Maybe it goes to show that the imagination, well mine at least, far outweighs what can be done on screen.Disappointing :-(",Gerald's Game

If, however, you're a lover of cinema you're probably better off steering clear from this one because even though the acting and cinematography are fairly good, the message is so utterly transparent and politicized that you'll likely be bored with it after 30 minutes.",Gerald's Game

This is definitely a psychological thriller that invokes fear, panic, and a touch of nausea just for what this poor woman is going through. The story is so much bigger than you imagine.?It's not necessarily gory but there are a few seconds that are look away scenes...The acting was superb and the storyline is new and fresh...I was a huge Stephen King fan growing up but fell off the Castle Rock wagon a while ago and didn't even know he was behind this madness until I read the reviews after watching this movie. Maybe it's because I usually like his books better and didn't know this was his going in since I never read it. Definitely two thumbs up",Gerald's Game

A shame really, since there is a weird 15 minute epilogue that seems forced and tacked on, not to mention completely random.Still worth a look if only out of morbid curiosity.",Gerald's Game

Spoiler
The main character is the wife, we're supposed to follow her story and perhaps sympathy with her. But I couldn't. I don't know it's the acting or the type of character, I hated her from the beginning of the movie. She felt pity for the stray dog, but didn't do anything right then and there, later she tried to feed it beef, on a plate. Was the plate supposed to make it taste better?! Then they both went inside and left the door open, she noticed but didn't react, was she stupid? She was tied up to the bed, but it was just a couple of hours, not days so why the hell was she having hallucinations? Did she have some kind of mental illness?Then the story unfold and revealed her childhood, showed us the reason why she became so docile, but it was too late then. I didn't have any reason to care for her anymore. Next the stupid scene ""I'm writing this letter with my right hand"", the hand that was broken so she could escape the cuffs, were we supposed to feel something from this scene? Because what century was it? Ever hear of typing?",Gerald's Game

My issue, which again almost transcends the ability of one to review the other elements of the film with any seriousness given this regrettable aberration; is the appearance of the serial killing ""thing"" and the subsequent encounter therewith in the court room. I mean, really? The film stood on its own without this final fling. Yet, not only did the said aberration fail to add but instead it removed - decimated in fact. It took what was a respectable narrative and punched It - repeatedly - until the serious issue of a tormented woman who overcame her demons was totally subverted by the folly of giving the starring role, on the villain stakes, to this half baked, after thought of a serial killer. Serial killers don't typically work as after thoughts in my experience. What a shame.",Gerald's Game
358,tarahtnt,Far surpassed expectations,9,26 February 2018,"I have never reviewed a film before, but had to create an account just for this one. This film really makes you question just how sane Stephen King is for him to think of some of the aspects of this film. Not a single jump scare and I was petrified the whole time.

The movie as a stand-alone is great. The premise is simple, a woman gets trapped handcuffed to her bed post and must find a way to survive. There are many eerie elements that make this movie stand out in comparison to other ""survival"" movies. This one is a little more of a ""mental"" survival as well. It can be a little slow paced at times, but overall it was entertaining and had some very chilling scenes.",Gerald's Game

It wasn't even the kind of comical bad movie that you can laugh at with your friends; it was just boring. There is absolutely nothing scary about it apart from a creepy looking man who shows up a couple of times in the movie. However, what could've been a great scary character in him was let down by the complete lack of tension and atmosphere building up any sense of fear in the film. The characters are unlikeable so I can't even bring myself to care what happens to them in the first place and the hallucinations of herself and her husband seem completely disjointed from the moonlight man and it feels like two film concepts have been awkwardly pushed together into a nonsensical, dull waste of two hours of my life.",Gerald's Game

I got very nauseous when she cut her wrist to slide her hand out, but once the skin peeled up with the handcuff I was out. That was one of the grossest images I have ever seen in my entire life.

I see a lot of people found this movie boring which shocked me. This movie had me on the edge. I placed myself in her shoes or.. handcuffs.. and I was an anxious mess. Will the dog eat her? Will the moonlight man? Very stressful. I thought the ending was a necessary and beautifully done addition. We go through the main characters story in this movie as she hallucinates and I felt the ending really tied it off. Plus, it was a relief to hear background on the moonlight man. I might be able to sleep tomight.",Gerald's Game

366,brainmeal,"If you want a pure, easy horror flick, this is not the film for you.",8,1 April 2020,"OK, so I would like to start this by saying that I am a huge Stephen King fan, I have read a lot of his books and seen a good amount of the film adaptations. What makes King such an interesting writer is his books defy genres, they are equal parts creepy, scary, tense and often verging on fantasy, they take big hits and expect your imagination to catch up. This makes his books fantastic, however the films often struggle to convey this weird mix, and I feel that this is the reason this film has such mixed and poor reviews.
Now, the film is fantastically made, in my opinion. The acting is excellent, the cinematography, the interweaving of timelines and the pace all make it a film which where, essentially everything happens in one room, far from stale or dull. It really excels in presenting the characters interestingly, they are complex and flawed but not unbelievable. The central character goes through an almost spiritual journey of self discovery, as she is forced to confront her inner trauma. Through her pain, she understands and accepts herself and ultimately survives because of it.
And that is really what this film is about, a woman's journey through pain. About her finding her inner strength in a world that sought to ""minimise and objectify"" her, with a good amount of King's creepiness and tense atmosphere thrown in.
So in conclusion, if you like dramas and have a strong stomach, watch this film. If you are looking for an easy scare, then this is not the film for you.",Gerald's Game

But, in the last ten seconds, Flanagan saves it, and it all culminates in the most satisfying way it could've. If you watched this movie and hated the ending, try again...SPOILERS
Yes, it's borderline comical that the Moonlight Man is, in fact, NOT a figment of Jessie's dying mind. But that's okay. Because it's not about her literally confronting the Moonlight Man. It's about her confronting those who'd kept her captive; those who'd kept her fearful; those who'd made her weak. It's about Jessie confronting those who she never had the courage to confront before. The Moonlight Man is real because he has to be. He has to be real so that Jessie can finally stand up to her abusers in person. A perfect ending.",Gerald's Game
