0,MartinHafer,The BEST example of what is wrong with many Hollywood pictures today.,2,5 June 2008,"This is probably the very best example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. When people around the world complain that Hollywood is churning out over-budgeted, special effects-laden films with brainless plots, this is the first film that comes to mind. It was as if the studio execs knowingly produced a bad film because they simply knew that marketing and stupid effects would draw the undiscerning teens like flies to a corpse. And, I hate to admit it, but if the bottom line is money, then this film was a success. The fact that it made millions is depressing and further supports the notion that crap sells and quality is irrelevant in a bottom-line world. I found it so offensively dumb that I wanted my money back after seeing it--and it was in a dollar theater!! My teenage daughter felt equally appalled and said ""that's an hour and a half of my life down the drain!"". I am so proud of my girl!So let's talk about why I totally hated this film. Despite tons of money being spent on sets and all, it sounded like the dialog was written by a middle schooler. The worst example was the wretched and cliché-ridden scene where Van Helsing first meets his lady love. He walks into town as countless flying vampire maidens are soaring about--destroying the town and attacking the clichéd ""tough as nails"" heroine. Now, at this point, the annoying heroine is getting the crap knocked out of her by these vampires and Van Helsing literally saves her from certain death. So what does she do in the world of dumb dialog--she snaps out that she is doing just fine and she doesn't want his help! This is taking the spunky and petulant babe role to such a stupid extreme that I literally groaned out loud in the theater. And, did I mention is this 100% anachronistic film that Van Helsing helps her with the aid of a machine gun that shoots wooden stakes! Heck, such a gun would be next to impossible to make NOW--let alone back in the 19th century!!! The dialog and action is pretty consistent with this scene throughout the film--one petulant scene after another and one great special effects scene after another. While I appreciate the beauty of the special effects, without a plot and dialog, they are pretty much worthless.Since seeing this wretched film, I have talked to dozens of my high school students and adults about this. With only a few exceptions, the kids liked it with such comments like ""I loved the action"" and ""the flying vampire babes were cool""--and no mention of the story or characters. Those who hated it (mostly, but not exclusively adults) described it as ""brainless"" or ""just plain dumb"". Just because impressionable kids LIKE this sort of tripe, should we, as responsible parents, let them feed on a constant diet of this brain-rot?! God help us, as these kids are our future!",Van Helsing
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Nice images, but the film on the whole is entirely uninvolving.",4,23 June 2009,"Van Helsing does have some excellent sets and costumes, giving a dark macabre feel and some dark cinematography that was quite possibly the best thing of the film. I also liked the haunting music, and was on the whole impressed with Hugh Jackman in the title role, very brooding at times. Richard Roxburgh, despite some very cheesy material was good as the count.Unfortunately, these were the only redeeming qualities, to a film that is overall disappointingly uninvolving. What I mean by that, is that there isn't much of a story, which was too many times clumsy and unfocused. The dialogue was eye-rollingly cheesy, I think the count's lines were the worst. I wish I could give some examples, but I can't remember any of the dialogue. The performances were okay, Hugh Jackman certainly acquits himself well, and perhaps the only actor to rise above the challenge. However, Kate Beckinsale seemed to do nothing but act pretty, therefore a rather uninvolving character, and consequently there was little chemistry between her and Jackman.Overall, some good moments save a rather bland and uninvolving film, that also suffers from being overlong, that could have been much more with some better dialogue and a better story. 4/10 for trying. Bethany Cox.",Van Helsing
2,Leofwine_draca,"Less a tribute to Universal horror, more a mindless CGI mess",4,26 November 2016,"Stephen Sommers goes for broke with this big-budget monster mash, filmed in exactly the same vein as his MUMMY remake and just as disappointing. Things begin quite promisingly with a homage to the Universal classics of the 1930s but rapidly descend into inanity, as one hurried action sequence follows another with no logic, reason or plot to be seen at any point. The film is noisy, special effect-filled and totally lacking in characterisation or story, as superhero Van Helsing (renamed Gabriel – did they not have the rights to the character or something?) battles not only Dracula but werewolves and Frankenstein's Monster too (incorrectly called Frankenstein in one scene).The movie lasts for an astonishing two hours without offering anything new at all – you really will have seen everything that's on offer here. There are blatant rip-offs throughout and a lack of common sense on the part of the director that is really annoying – you can just picture him saying ""let's have that woman fall off the roof and jump down a tree! cool!"" Hugh Jackman is pretty wooden as the hero, but who can blame him given the material, whilst Kate Beckinsale does ridiculous rather well. Richard Roxburgh, an actor who I really liked in MOULIN ROUGE, is similarly awful as camp goth-vamp Dracula, whilst David Wenham, gives the best performance as the comic relief. The special effects are wicked, as you would expect given the budget – those werewolf transformations are particularly good – although the flying female vampires look a little too CGI for my liking. Sadly, the said effects don't save what is essentially a dog of a film.",Van Helsing
3,SnoopyStyle,I laughed... I cried... but I don't think I'm supposed to.,3,7 May 2004,"Doctor Victor Frankenstein creates his monster. The village mob is at the gates. Count Dracula and his three brides arrive to take Frankenstein's scientific conquest over God. He kills Frankenstein and leaves the windmill in fiery ruins. Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan are hunting a werewolf when Velkan is thrown off a cliff. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) kills Mr. Hyde and has become the most wanted killer in Europe. His next assignment from a secret Catholic order is to hunt down Dracula. In a battle with Dracula's brides, he is joined by Anna.This is one of those movies that are SO over the top, that it is difficult to criticize. Although, I certainly will try. The action is non-stop, the acting is atrocious, and the story is completely convoluted. The accents by the actors are so bad that it was laughable. At times, I actually did laugh. The brides are wild. They seem to be channeling old style acting from the silent era horrors.I do have to give the movie credit. It doesn't care. As the movie gets more silly, the action piles on. It gets crazier and it's a mess. The CGI is non-stop. I watched this in the theater with a group of friends and nobody liked it. We were left shaking our heads in exasperation.",Van Helsing
4,Hitchcoc,Endless and Pointless,3,21 March 2006,"We are constantly being reminded that we can't understand movies if we are not into cgi (computer generated images). Well, that doesn't work for me. That's like saying a black light Elvis picture is true art because I don't appreciate black felt. Movies are good because they have a story to tell, not because they are endless eye candy. The convoluted nature of this film, taking every random horror element possible, just doesn't work. This is too bad. I think Hugh Jackman is a really charismatic actor. It's just that they throw so much against the wall to see what sticks. Maybe if, like video games, the movie came with a manual, explaining the rules that each character can play by, it would be helpful. Some can die; oops, I guess they can't. Some can fly; oops, I guess not. How do you kill those already dead? I am a big fan of the classic horror genre. When I saw the trailer to this at another film, I was really excited. I thought maybe a young Van Helsing would be a little more cerebral. He is just kind of a supernatural bounty hunter who goes on and on and on. Where does he find the energy. Personally I like the guy with the thick glasses who is not afraid to look into the eyes of Lugosi's Dracula and tell him off. ""There are things worse than death, Mr. Van Helsing!"" Dracula says. Maybe this movie is one of them.",Van Helsing
5,claudio_carvalho,"Spectacular Adventure With Frankenstein, Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Werewolves... and Van Helsing - A Must-See Movie",10,9 May 2004,"In 1887, Van Helsing is in Paris chasing Mr. Hyde. After eliminating him, Van Helsing goes to Rome, where he receives a new assignment from the Vatican: to help Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp), the last members of a catholic family, to fight against Dracula. With the company of the monk Carl (David Wenham), they go to Transilvania, where they fight, together with Anna and Frankenstein, against Dracula, his three brides and a werewolf. This movie is a spectacular adventure. I participated of a promotion in a Brazilian cable television (Telecine) and I won the tickets for the `avant-premiere' of this film on 05 May 2004, in one of the last movie theaters in Rio de Janeiro not located in malls, but on the street (Cine Palácio). With a huge screen, excellent sound system and high headroom, these factors highlighted the wonderful gothic photography of this film, which in some parts recalls the German expressionism. The beginning of the story in black and white is very impressive, and I dare to say that it is a great homage to the monsters of Universal studio. The state-of-art special effects are amazing. I have not recognized Kate Beckinsale in her role of Anna: she is strong, wearing curled long hair and believe me, more beautiful than usual. The story is funny, full of action, therefore it is a must-see film.  When I watch, for example, an Ingmar Bergman's movie or an art film, I expect a message of life, something to think about. When I see movies like `Pirates of the Caribbean', `Kill Bill', `Indiana Jones', `The Mummy', `The Lord of the Ring', `Harry Potter', `Spider Man' etc., I expect a great adventure. And what is Van Helsing's proposal? A breathless action movie, having lots of humor (the gay style of Dracula, most of the scenes with Carl, the English accent of Dracula and his three brides, Mr. Hyde looking like Hulk etc.), a romance between Van Helsing and Anna, special effects where sometimes we are not able to identify what is real or not, a great homage to famous monsters, therefore, it is excellent for its proposal of entertainment. I still bet that it will be included in the IMDB Top 250 list pretty soon. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): `Van Helsing, O Caçador de Monstros' (`Van Helsing, The Hunter of Monsters')",Van Helsing
6,claudio_carvalho,Excellent Adventure,10,30 November 2004,"In May, 2004, I watched the opening screening of Van Helsing in Rio de Janeiro. It was a very joyful event, with the promoters team dressed with the costumes of the film and distributing crucifixes and worm shaped candies. In that occasion, I loved this movie. Last week, Van Helsing was released on DVD and last Friday I saw this movie again. My opinion is exactly the same: Van Helsing is a spectacular adventure, full of special effects, having very funny moments, and with very unfair reviews. I am very curious with these contradictory point of views, since practically all my friends and colleagues who saw 'Van Helsing' love this movie and share my opinion; the DVD is full of extras and is one of the top ten in the lists of the most sold DVDs in Brazil; therefore, I do not understand why the high number of bad reviews. My vote is again ten.Title (Brazil): 'Van Helsing, O Caçador de Monstros' ('Van Helsing, The Hunter of Monsters')",Van Helsing
7,mark.waltz,Films like this are the reason why movie theaters need to provide free pain killers.,4,26 October 2021,"Okay, so it's enjoyable. But does that make it a good movie? Certainly not. If he comes basically a rip-off movie, especially a sequence when Hugh Jackman as the title character end up meeting a character straight out of the inventor of murderous contraptions from James Bond films. I'm going to Yes it gets last from its familiarity, but it's a cheap shot and after a while, the film becomes overloaded with a lot of these. In 2 hours and 15 minutes, the film becomes so over-the-top in noise and effects and obvious fake sets that it's a film that you feel guilty about liking and take pleasure in hating.Does every moment in a film I need to be a big moment? That's the question that is asked about half an hour into the film when you realize that there has not been a moment to breathe since I feel really bad. The opening sequence, in black and white, is an excellent homage to classic Universal horror films, combining Frankenstein and his monster and Dracula, played so ridiculously over the top by Richard Roxburgh with no subtlety, reminding me of child catcher from ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" rather than Lugosi, Lee, Langella or Oldman. Once again, Frankenstein's monster is played as a misunderstood creature brought back to life against his will, extremely vulnetable, that it just becomes rather ridiculous by the time the sequence is over.The film becomes very bizarre during a scene involving mr. Hyde, an idiotic giant whom Van Helsing quickly wounds by cutting off its arm. Then there's a sequence with Dracula's brides, annoyingly loud and dizzying and totally annoying. This is where you meet the tough woman played by Kate Beckinsale, an overly confident character who won't accept help from anybody let alone on man whose only intentions are to prevent her from becoming the next appetizer for the three lousy actresses going over the top as the Spice Girls variation of the three Mrs. Toothy's. Kevin J. O'Connor, as Igor, gives a wretched Lugosi impression, something that Roxborough thankfully does not.You may think of breaking into Monty Python's variation of always look on the bright side of life when Beckinsale quotes always look on the bright side of death, adding more eye-rolling comedy into the cartoonist characterizations and set up. In spite of how ridiculously juvenile it all is, like an over-extended Scooby-Doo meets the Universal horror monsters, it's difficult to look away because what there are as far as sets (which is difficult to tell in today's overly computer-generated world) are opulent and grand, even though the script feels like it was written in either crayon or ketchup or some other red liquid, and never seriously given any consideration to character.When a man Beckinsale comes in contact with turns into the werewolf, it's basically Dracula with fur because the special effects and the presentations of the teeth aren't any different. Had this been about half an hour shorter, I could have given it a slightly higher rating because it would have been faster moving and not as pondering. But it becomes a bit too much as it surpasses 2 hours, and it really does become far too juvenile with nothing to really grab the viewer's imagination other than how to creatively find ways enjoy it other than just a guilty pleasure.",Van Helsing
8,classicsoncall,"""For you, my good son, this is all a test of faith.""",6,30 August 2020,"This is almost too silly for words, but I did like the idea of bringing back Frankenstein, Count Dracula, Dr. Jekyll and the Wolf Man together, all in one picture. Well, not really the Wolf Man, but close enough. It was almost like Van Helsing's (Hugh Jackman) sidekick Carl (David Wenham) was challenging the script writers with one of his own lines - ""How many commandments can we break in one day?"" Yet the production design is pretty good, and the principal players are easy enough on the eyes. The action scenes are pretty frantic, even if some of the CGI employed is a bit dodgy. I don't know about the flying vampire brides though, they could have been a bit sexier. The story reaches it's epic conclusion when the Werewolf Gabriel puts the bite on the Satanic Dracula. You want to know who they were, you'll have to watch the picture. I can't give everything away here.",Van Helsing
9,gavin6942,"A Guilty Pleasure, But Still a Bad Film",5,1 April 2007,"Gabriel VanHelsing (an immortal, younger, less educated Abraham VanHelsing) and Kate Beckinsale must fight vampires, werewolves, Mr. Hyde, and some weird little creatures that are like Jawas with gas masks... can Hugh Jackman still kick butt when he's not Wolverine? I liked this film, but hate myself for liking it. The plot was cheesy, the CGI was overwhelmingly bad, the characters all exhibited some sort of infinite gymnastic skill and luck on landing (apparently they always roll a 20 on their balance checks) and the target audience was clearly rather young. Especially because of the CGI, this was a film I should have hated. My friend Jason says he read a review that claimed Troma could make a better film... and it was probably true.What I liked was the fact it was so over-the-top. Once or twice and I would have been ""yeah right"" but doing things to the extreme fifty times made it one of those ""so bad it's good"" films for me. Also, I think this is by far Kate Beckinsale's most alluring role. (I think she plays a similar character in ""Underworld"", which I haven't seen, and I imagine that's comparable.) The use of the Frankenstein story was well done. The Dracula story I think was more of a stretch, and why VanHelsing had to be completely re-written from the Stoker version I don't know and don't support. So many aspects of this film reminded me of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" with the combination of old characters and the futuristic weaponry. But, I think this film might have sucked less. Maybe.Would I watch it again? It's possible, if only to get a better second opinion now that I know what's to be expected. But it frankly was not a good film, and there's no way to convince me that it was. We have received much better from Hugh Jackman... let's do hi ma favor and pretend this one never happened.",Van Helsing
10,jboothmillard,Van Helsing,4,14 February 2008,"I admit I did want to see this when it was at the cinemas, but seeing I'm glad I didn't, but it is okay film from director Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns), who I suppose is trying to capture some of the other memorable Universal monsters in one film. The film opens with Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West) creating his monster, but with Count Vladislaus Dracula (Moulin Rouge's Richard Roxburgh), you understand why they were working together later, but of course Frankenstein and his monster (Shuler Hensley) are burned by the outside mob, while Dracula escapes. Years later (stil the 19th Century by the way) we go to the great Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), a famed monster hunter trying to catch Dr. Jekyll, or rather Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane), and failing. But anyway, the real story comes about when he is given a mission to protect the last two members of the Valerious family in Transylvania. When he and his friar sidekick Carl (The Lord of the Rings' David Wenham) gets there, Van Helsing at first is questionable, especially by Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale, putting on quite a sexy Transylvanian accent), but he proves his worth when some vampires start attacking. As the plot develops we find out that Dracula is planning a mass attack on the town for all the blood they lust, by hatching some eggs full of deadly bat-type creatures. To do this though, the need an electrical charge that can only come from either lightning, or with the help of Frankenstein's monster, who is still living. As it continues, Anna's brother Velkan (Will Kemp) is turned into a werewolf, Dracula is defeated almost really easily, Van Helsing's werewolf is stopped, but he failed to complete his mission, i.e. Anna dies. Also starring Elena Anaya as Aleera, The Mummy's Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor, The Mummy Returns' Alun Armstrong as Cardinal Jinette, Silvia Colloca as Verona, Josie Maran as Marishka and Tom Fisher as Top Hat. The special effects are good, the dialogue is really cheesy, the acting isn't much better, it is just lame, and only worth watching at least once. Okay!",Van Helsing
11,ccthemovieman-1,"Yes, Fun For An Hour, But Then Overkill",5,9 September 2006,"This may be the classic case of overkill, literally and on the subject of violence being the appeal of the movie. It's the old, if 10 killings were successful before in a film, lets try 100! This is movie almost literally non-stop action for just over two hours. Oddly enough I liked this movie the first time I saw it. Maybe that was so because my expectations were very low. All I had read what criticism of this film, so I expected an awful film. About a year later, on my second look, now with raised expectations, I found it so ludicrous I canned it halfway through and this time agreed with the critics.After one hour of the movie, your senses have been so bombarded with action that you are almost numb. The longest lull in the movie was probably two minutes. It's ridiculous. Plus, the dialog is incredibly stupid.I wish Kate Bekinsale would can these tough-girl roles. They don't suit her. The only good character in the movie was Dracula, played by Richard Roxburgh and the best special-effects monster was the Wolf Man. Otherwise, this is two hours of the same people going after the same monsters with so much action that it actually gets boring.",Van Helsing
12,Tweekums,Van Helsing fights Dracula with a little help from Frankenstein's monster!,7,2 August 2015,"As this film opens Dr. Frankenstein has just finished his famous creation when a hoard of torch carrying villagers attack his castle. His patron, one Count Dracula, isn't too concerned; he just wants the creature for his own nefarious purposes and has no further need of the doctor. On the other side of Europe monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing has been summoned to the Vatican; here he is told to head to Transylvania and help the last remaining members of the Valerious in their generations old battle against Dracula. Upon arrival he quickly finds himself helping protect a village from an attack by Dracula's three brides. After this battle he teams up with Anna Valerious (and later Frankenstein's monster) for a battle that will see them fighting werewolves, vampires assorted monsters before a final confrontation with Dracula himself!If you are looking for a scary horror movie you are likely to be rather disappointed; I can't see this really scaring anybody has reached their teens. However if you are looking for an action packed adventure that tries to pack in elements from every classic Gothic horror as well as quite a few laughs then you should enjoy this. The action barely lets up from start to finish as our heroes battle the forces of evil. Hugh Jackman is great in the title role as he uses an array of weapons such as an automatic crossbow to fight the Brides of Dracula. These brides are suitably seductive without being overly so. Other notable performances come from Kate Beckinsale as Anna and Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. With all the action it may seem surprising that there is time for humour but there are quite a few laughs; many provided by Friar Carl; the Vatican's answer to James Bond's Q, and Igor, Dr Frankenstein's former assistant. The CGI effects are good especially during the many scenes where various creatures transform from their human appearance to a more monstrous one. There is little here to offend and the violence is fairly fantastical so this film can be enjoyed by people of most ages the BBFC '12' certificate is probably about right as children younger than that might find it too scary. Overall a fairly fun film that passes a couple of hours without requiring too much thought.",Van Helsing

14,BA_Harrison,"Fangs for nothing, Mr. Sommers.",4,24 June 2009,"At one point during Stephen Sommers' comic book horror/adventure Van Helsing, Count Dracula states that he ""has no heart, he is unable to feel joy or sorrow, he is hollow"". I know exactly what he means because that's how I felt whilst watching Sommers' film: completely unmoved by the whole experience.Sure, there's a ton of in your face special effects and spectacular set-pieces galore, but none of it connects. It's not scary, it's not funny (despite trying), and it's not exciting; it's just there on the screen, flashy, slick, and irritatingly loud, for over two very long hours. For today's gaming generation, I guess this might be enough, but I found the whole affair lacking.Hugh Jackman's titular character is a Vatican-approved vampire slayer who is given the task of hunting down and destroying Dracula before he is able to bring to life his multitude of spawn (the result of having 400 years to kill with three very hot brides). Along with trusty sidekick Carl (who is responsible for an array of technologically advanced weaponry) and beautiful Transylvanian princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale in a tightly laced corset—yum!), Van Helsing faces a series of monstrous creatures and perilous pitfalls as he battles to save the world from the evil count and his offspring.After a fairly promising opening scene—a classy monochromatic homage to the Universal monster movies of the 30s and 40s—Sommers says 'to hell with logic and pacing', slams his movie into top gear, and unleashes a barrage of outrageous action scenes and lavish computer effects that lend the film a sense of realism that is comparable to your average Looney Tunes cartoon.The result is audacious to say the least, but the director pushes his luck too far, overstepping the mark on many an occasion: against convention, his Dracula is only vulnerable to werewolves (?!?!); his plot reveals a cure for lycanthropy, a contrivance that proves very convenient for our hero; Van Helsing and Anna possess unnatural agility and superhuman resilience, performing Olympic standard gymnastic moves with ease and surviving numerous high falls without suffering so much as a scratch; Van Helsing leaps over a chasm in a horse drawn carriage; and Frankenstein's monster swings through a window on a power cable to rescue Anna from a vampire.To be fair, Sommers' mish-mash of monsters and mythical mayhem isn't completely devoid of worth—the sultry brides of Dracula are great, the set design is fantastic, and Greg Cannom's make-up is impressive, particularly for Frankenstein's monster—but the film's 'positives' are overwhelmed by the effects and the sheer unrelenting silliness of the action which stretches plausibility to breaking point.",Van Helsing
15,blanche-2,"you can't kill it, it's already dead",6,2 January 2005,"I'm an enormous fan of Hugh Jackman's so I watched this movie. I'm a bit distressed that, besides X-Men, Hugh can't get a blockbuster film deserving of his talent and charisma - which I witnessed first-hand watching him on stage in ""Boy From Oz."" I have to say up front I'm not a particular fan of the horror film genre and Hugh was my only reason to watch this. Having said that, I think this movie didn't know whether to be funny or serious so it didn't make it as either. It probably would have worked better had it been camped up a lot more.The movie looks gorgeous and it certainly had some interesting things in it, but I was bored by it.

17,Coventry,"This must be a joke... A very irritating, BAD joke!",1,16 May 2004,"Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr. and all the other classic horror actors are turning in their graves right nowThe powerful, atmospheric tales they once made immortal are totally being messed up by a bunch of boisterous computer-effects freaks here! Biggest t**t of them all is 'director' Stephen Sommers, who seems to make a career out of destroying horror milestones. But at least his ugly 'The Mummy'-version had a bit of a story and followed some sort of structure. This film has absolutely NOTHING in it! Nothing, nada!! With horror, this hasn't got anything to doThe film is a whole playground for (awful) special effects and the latest computer gimmicks. In an incredibly clumsy way, the story lines of Dracula, Frankenstein, The Wolf Man and even Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde are being mixed here. Key-figure in it all is Van Helsing, played by Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman. In the legendary original, Prof. Van Helsing was named Abraham and he had amazing literature knowledge. Now, he's called Gabriel, he works for the Vatican and I don't think he ever read a book. He has a James Bond collection of gadgets and  on top of it all  an irritating and unfunny monk following him around everywhere. Dracula is played by a meaningless fool, Frankenstein's monster all of a sudden seems to have an IQ of 150 and the Wolf Man couldn't look more fake. Sommers is constantly making up new horror-`rules' and he seems to think he can get away with everything. Kate Beckinsdale also walks around in this film. I'll be the very first to admit she's one good looking lady, but she can by no means act! Her character Anna constantly smashes with her head against walls, but she doesn't lose one drop of blood. I'm not going to waste further words to this film: It's terrible! Downright awful and the biggest insult to anyone who ever respected the horror genre. Before it's release already, we knew this wouldn't be a very intellectual approach of the genre, but Van Helsing even goes beneath your lowest expectations. It's irritating from start to finish and you'll more than once feel the need to get up and walk out on it. Death to Stephen Sommers and his entire computer entourage!",Van Helsing
18,michaelRokeefe,More than one man can handle.,5,5 April 2005,"Overblown and a bit silly, but more than enough rousing CGI action to hold your interest. Scripted chaos with elementary cheesy dialogue. Let your eyes overrule your brain and VAN HELSING is a never-ending battle against the forces of evil. Fabled monster hunter Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman)is summoned to take on Frankenstein's Monster(Shuler Hensley)and a somewhat redefined Count Dracula(Richard Roxburgh). First he has to deal with Mr. Hyde(Robbie Coltrane)in a bell tower. Upon arriving in Transylvania he enters a love/hate relationship with Anna Valerious(Kate Beckinsale)and together they battle lovely swift-winged female vampires and deal with Anna's brother who has become a werewolf.My favorite scene is of the horse drawn carriage winding and navigating snow covered Transylvania and jumping the destroyed bridge. I also liked watching Van Helsing blow holes in the voluptuous vampires with his gas powered spear gun. Also in the cast are: David Wenham, Elena Anaya, Kevin J. O'Connor and Will Kemp.

It stars Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh, David Wenham, Shuler Hensley, Elena Anaya, Will Kemp, Kevin J. O'Connor and Alun Armstrong. Music is by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Allen Daviau.Famed monster hunter Van Helsing (Jackman) is sent to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula's (Roxburgh) fiendish plan involving the Frankenstein Monster and the Wolf Man.Well it was universally savaged by the pro critics and is considered a flop. Yet whilst understanding those things, it does for a reason hold above average ratings on the big internet movie sites. It did find a market (and continues to do so), it's like one big long MTV video, a sort of chaotic monster fun frolic in rock opera style.It's effects laden, which is no great thing since they are shoddy, and the dialogue is often as cringe worthy as some of the accents are. Yet it's still a thrilling ride, a strap yourself in and run with it job, to be in the company of sexy lead actors in Gothic garb and devilish period surrounds.Loud and boisterous for sure, and tacky at times, but exhilarating all the same for those after some pure escapist carnage. 5/10",Van Helsing

He's helped by feisty Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale).This has been trashed by critics everywhere. No it isn't good at all...but I've seen worse. It starts off great with a black & white prologue dealing with Dr. Frankenstein creating the Monster for Dracula. The doctor is killed and so is his creation (supposedly). Then it cuts to a year later with Van Helsing being sent to battle Dracula and his three wives who are attacking a nearby village for blood. There he finds a werewolf roaming about also and the Monster is alive. But Dracula wants the monster to....FORGET IT! The plot just gets more vague and sillier as it goes on. Anyways plot is not the reason this movie exists--it's done to push CGI down our throats.There's LOTS of action in this film, incredible special effects (all are CGI) and tons of explosions and such---but I was bored. The plot is WAY too vague and the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book. There's no characterizations or depth to ANY of the characters--how was I supposed to care for these people when I didn't know who they were? Also this film has way too much going on it in--the opening has Van Helsing killing Mr. Hyde (and Dr. Jekyll too)! And pitting him against THREE monsters was just overkill. Jackman was very good (considering he had nothing to do). Beckinsale was terrible but it's not her fault. Wenham unfortunately plays the ""comic"" relief (and is hating every second of it). Kemp has little screen time but he is good (and VERY handsome). Hensley is good as Frankenstein's monster. The makeup on the vampires and werewolves was VERY impressive too. And there was a great fight between two monsters at the end. But it's all money and CGI and no plot or characters. It's also frustrating that the violence was really toned down for the PG-13--there's next to no blood or gore in this film. And it's TOO LONG--an elaborate masquerade party could have been left out completely (and is a total ripoff of Roman Polanski's ""The Fearless Vampire Killers""). This was a bomb at the box office so we're (thankfully) not going to get any sequels. I can't recommend it--but kids will like it.",Van Helsing

23,poolandrews,Top quality big budget monster bashing action packed entertainment.,8,25 December 2006,"Van Helsing starts in 'Transylvania 1887' where Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West) succeeds in bring his creation (Shuler Hensley) to life, however the evil Count Vladislaus Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) wants it & the secret of Frankenstein's experiments to help him give life to his young... Jump forward 'One Year Later' to 'Vatican City Rome' where Cardinal Jinette (Alun Armstrong) orders monster killer Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) to Transylvania to destroy Count Dracula, Van Helsing has little choice. Once there Van Helsing meets up with Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) who is also trying to kill Count Dracula, they team up together to achieve this goal but they quickly discover it's not as easy as they had hoped...This American Czech Republic co-production was written, co-produced & directed by Stephen Sommers & I have to say I have now seen Van Helsing twice & enjoyed it immensely both times. The script is set in a fictional Victorian world which lots of familiar monsters & character's inhabit & it has them all meet up, in this sense it's very similar to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) although I think Van Helsing is a better film. Anyway, the film moves along like an absolute rocket, you can't take your eyes off it for a second or you'll miss a fight, a monster, a great set, a ridiculously extravagant set-piece or just Kate Beckinsale in that super sexy outfit complete with ultra tight corset & thigh boots. The entire film is littered with references to other classic horror/action films, in fact I'd say maybe it relies too much on paying homage & not quite enough time on being original but when a films this much fun I'll cut it some slack. The character's are not that well developed but since most will already be familiar with them who cares? On a negative side perhaps the pace is too fast, no-one ever seems to stop to catch a breathe & as a result as I've mentioned the character's & plot are given little to develop & suffer plus there is some truly awful dialogue that at times is quite embarrassing & then there's the fact it lasts for over 2 hours, on a personal level I dislike films which are too long & I'd have preferred Van Helsing to be a bit shorter although I can't think of anything I'd like to see less of. Overall though I thought it was a cracker & provides terrific non-stop entertainment as long as your not after something serious or deep, which I'm not because for me films are ALL about entertainment, it's as simple & straight forward as that.Director Sommers does OK, having said that he seems intent on bombarding us with non stop CGI special effects, fights, action set-pieces & monsters, while for the most part they're spectacular it does get a bit repetitive after a solid two hours of the stuff. To be honest in a weird way I feel like I'm criticising a Lottery win because I won too much money, strange eh? With so much overblown CGI on show there's no subtlety in Van Helsing at all, forget about much suspense or any of the scares which the original films Van Helsing was based on were all about. To keep the rating down the violence in Van Helsing isn't explicit & forget about any blood as it's not that sort of horror film.With a mind boggling supposed budget of about $160,000,000 (!) Van Helsing looks brilliant, everything is so extravagant, the special effects are top-notch, the set-pieces are as big as they come & the whole thing looks fabulous with some cool sets from the Transylvanian village to the interior (& exterior for that matter) of Count Dracula's Gothic castle to Dr. Frankenstein's lab & I love the story in the IMDb's 'Trivia' section for Van Helsing which claims that the lab was equipped with antique medical equipment purchased on eBay! The acting isn't up to much but then did you expect it to be? You know I really do think it was a great decision to cast Beckinsale who is a real hot looking bird & have her kicking the hell out of people in that outfit, good work all round I reckon. Roxburgh complete with earrings makes for a slightly campy but still quite cool Dracula.Van Helsing isn't for everyone that's for sure, the purists & those looking for something a little quieter & a bit more serious should avoid it. Those looking for top big budget mindless entertainment to pass a couple of hours, don't mind the odd lapse in logic & like hot women in tight corsets & thigh boots then Van Helsing could very well be the film for you. I loved pretty much every overblown, over-the-top second of it & if you have a problem with that sue me...",Van Helsing

Kate Beckinsale sort-of recreates her ""Underworld"" role as she becomes his kick-ass sidekick.

25,dbborroughs,Its not a vampire its a turkey,3,8 May 2004,"This movie is painful to watch. Why didn't some one stop director Stephen Sommers and his directorial excess is beyond me. I like The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, I even like Deep Rising, which this resembles in its desire to top itself at every turn.Van Helsing, a thousands year old man who works with the Vatican is sent off to fight Dracula, his brides, werewolves and the Frankenstein monster. Its everything to excess as the filmmakers rub your nose in everything that they've stolen by referring to every damned film they've ever seen.
Its awful.The opening sequence in black and white is meant to be a throw back to the Universal horror films of the 1930's and 40's, it comes off as if a bad jokey TV commercial. The next sequence of Van Helsing in Paris with Mr Hyde is clever and works, except that its a rip off of the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen in the design of Hyde. At this point, with Van Helsing returning to the Vatican the film falls into an abyss of rip off mania, the worst being the Q like monk. You know Q from James Bond?From here its off to Dracula and its over blown over done sequence after sequence as more and more and more crap is thrown into the mix.Sommers has said that this is a film that he would have made when he was nine. Well did he have to regress himself and allow that nine year old to actually do so? Then again I can't see any nine year old actually liking this...Don't get me wrong, except for Igor's make up (which would have been bad twenty years ago) the effects and the technical film making and some of the script (not all) are okay, granted the effects can  shift from good to laughable but mostly they are okay. The problem is that the film doesn't have any sense holding it together. There is no sense of anything other than more is less.More is less is also true of the acting. With the sole exception of Hugh Jackman everyone over plays it.I spent most of this movie physically pained, batter by the over done nature of it and the fact that all I could help but think was ""this should have been better"" over and over again.You don't need to give your money to the producers on this one. Only doing so will think we want a sequel and that would be a very bad thing. Stay home and begin a stamp collection, its a much more rewarding way to spend two hours.",Van Helsing
26,lastliberal,Rings of garlic... holy water... silver stake... crucifix...,6,2 March 2008,"The opening to this movie was classic. I really liked seeing the villagers storming the castle to kill Dr. Frankenstein and his creation. But, what was Dracula doing there? We quickly switch to a really strange Jekyll/Hyde that looks something out of Jack and the Beanstalk, and a secret order of the Catholic Church that employs Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) to fulfill their mission of stamping out evil in the world (minus the priests that prey on boys, of course). There is even a James Bond type Q Branch with new weapons. It is obvious that this is not going to be your father's Dracula/Van Helsing movie.The action is fast, the costuming, sound, CGI, and makeup are first rate. Dracula is brought into the 21st Century with a bang. But, is that bang worth the time? Well, the fire works were amazing and the flying creatures were stunningly beautiful.

27,zardoz-13,Outrageously preposterous but thoroughly entertaining!,10,6 February 2008,"Writer & director Stephen Sommers reinvents the nemesis of ""Dracula"" in ""Van Helsing"" starring Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Sommers brings the same larger-than-life swashbuckling bravado to ""Van Helsing"" that he brought to his macabre but campy reboot of ""The Mummy"" (1932) in the blockbuster Brendan Fraser flicks ""The Mummy"" (1999) and ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001). Even more outrageously preposterous but thoroughly entertaining than Sommers' adrenalin-driven ""Mummy"" remakes, ""Van Helsing"" alters more than Dracula's archenemy. Sommers performs makeovers on the Frankenstein monster and Dracula's brides, too. Now, the Frankenstein monster fights for the good guys, while the airborne vampire brides swoop down like harpies on their victims and haul them away in their talons. Even Dracula himself undergoes changes. Stakes through the heart, garlic, crucifixes, holy water and sunlight have no effect. However, nothing is as radical as the transformation of Van Helsing. In the original 1931 ""Dracula,"" Professor Abraham Van Helsing was a much older man with close-cropped hair and thick glasses who practiced medicine. In other words, 60-year old vampire slayer Edward Van Sloan looked nothing like buffed up ""X-Men"" star Hugh Jackman. Neither does Jackman resemble the venerable Peter Cushing, who portrayed Van Helsing as an older but more energetic professor type during the 1950s-60s in five Hammer ""Dracula"" movies. An unkempt Anthony Hopkins hammed up the role in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992). The closest anybody has come to Hugh Jackson's Gabriel Van Helsing is Christopher Plummer in ""Dracula 2000."" Nonetheless, even Plummer played Van Helsing as an older man armed with a deadly cross-bow. Not only does Jackman arm himself with a gas-operated, semi-automatic cross-bow, but also he totes two six-guns and a hand-held, kung-fu flying guillotine. For martial arts illiterates, a hand-held, kung-fu flying guillotine looks like a Frisbee with jagged metal edges. Young, virile, and fast on the draw, Jackman's Van Helsing dresses like an Italian western gunslinger with a black, floor-length coat and a broad-brimmed hat. His uncanny resemblance to Clint Eastwood enhances that impression.""Van Helsing"" hits you with back-to-back prologues that identify the chief characters. An enraged Transylvanian mob storms Dracula's castle in the late 1880s. Evidently, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"") has given Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West of ""Notting Hill"") refuge in his castle, so the scientist can complete his experiments with reanimating dead tissue. Of course, Dracula isn't generous for nothing. He has a stake in giving life to the dead offspring of him and his brides. Thousands of icky-looking embryos that dangle lifelessly from the ceiling like wasp nests clutter up Dracula's castle. Meanwhile, the Vatican dispatches Van Helsing as their troubleshooter to destroy monsters. In his opening prologue, Van Helsing appears in Paris with the Eiffel Tower under construction and battles the only non-Universal Studios monster, the Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane's voice), half of Dr. Jekyll. Afterward, our stalwart hero rides back on horse to the Vatican for new orders. Director John Carpenter first linked the Vatican with destroying vampires in his own movie ""Vampires"" (1998) with James Woods as a cross-bow wielding vampire killer. Although he wears old west duds, Van Helsing acts more like James Bond. At the Vatican, the equivalent of 007's Q in the guise of Friar Carl (scene-stealing David Wenham, Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) devises a variety of gadgets for Van Helsing. Cardinal Jinette (Alun Armstrong of ""Patriot Games"") dispatches Van Helsing to save the last two members of a vampire slaying clan. They are gypsy princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale of ""Pearl Harbor"") and her brother Veklan (Will Kemp of ""Mindhunters"")who gets bitten by a werewolf early on in the action. Unfortunately, Veklan falls under Dracula's power and becomes his werewolf slave. Initially, neither Van Helsing nor Anna likes each other, but they join forces reluctantly to put Dracula on ice. In the middle of all this mayhem, we find the Frankenstein monster (Shuler Hensley of ""Someone Like You"") serving as the key to Dracula's efforts to give his dead offspring life.Sommers pulls out all stops in this slam-bang, high-octane, over-the-top, roller-coaster of an adventure that has vampires and werewolves battling each other. Twists follow turns in the contrived but imaginative plot, and surprises alternate with shocks. Although he has revamped those classic horror characters, Sommers' ""Van Helsing"" consists more of atmospheric, computer-generated locales and harrowing jolts that occur when monsters appear suddenly behind characters for maximum shock effect. No, anybody over age 12 shouldn't suffer nightmares from this formulaic action epic, because ""Van Helsing"" is basically a horror comedy. Imagine a monster mash cross-between of ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" and ""The Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me But Your Teeth Are In My Neck"" (1967), and you'll know what to expect of ""Van Helsing."" Nothing about ""Van Helsing"" is remotely credible, but the breathlessly paced story throws so many curves that you cannot predict what is going to happen from one set-piece to the next. When Hugh Jackman isn't performing testosterone-fueled stunts, Kate Beckinsale indulges in her own estrogen-based acrobatics that make her werewolf slayer in ""Underworld"" seem tame by comparison. Neither character has enough time to romance the other, because they find themselves constantly jumping through metaphorical flaming hoops in an unceasing battle with evil. If ""Van Helsing"" has a flaw, it is casting Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. He looks like Dudley Moore and he lacks menace. You have to wonder why Universal couldn't have attracted a bigger star to off-set the combined star power of Beckinsale and Jackman. Ultimately, while ""Van Helsing"" is never boring, the changes in these legendary horror characters probably won't bother younger audiences as much as older ones weaned on inflexible rules governing the behavior of vampires and werewolves. You'll get your money's worth out of ""Van Helsing.""",Van Helsing

29,Boba_Fett1138,Too much!,7,23 October 2004,"Man, this movie was way too intense. Normally I like fast paced Hollywood movies with lot's of action and special effects but this movie has just too much action. All of the things are happening too fast after another, the movie doesn't give you time to think or even breath! However does that mean it didn't liked this movie? No that was not the case, I thought the movie was very enjoyable and I find it still recommendable.Even though there is a special effects overkill, they are impressive to watch nevertheless and probably that alone makes this movie worth to watch. The movie doesn't really have more to offer than that, it feels like the story is just of minor importance and even though Hugh Jackman is good in his role, his character just doesn't really become interesting, which is not his fault. The makers should have probably spend more time on the story and character instead of just the special effects. Maybe if this was the case they also wouldn't had changed Van Helsing's name in Gabriel Van Helsing instead of Abraham which is the original name. Director Stephen Sommers however thought that the name Abraham was just too old fashioned and not cool enough, he didn't want to make a movie in which his main character is named Abraham or so he claimed in a TV interview I saw a long time ago before the movie release. From that moment on I feared the worst for this movie. Yes, a different director would have been more appropriate probably, someone who did had some more respect for all the old horror characters and their names. Van Helsing will always stay the old professor to me and not the action hero like he is portrayed in this movie.Poor Richard Roxburgh. It's not like his Dracula performance is bad but it's just that there have been so many better Dracula's like Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee and Gary Oldman, compared to them his performance turns pale which can also be blamed on the script.But like I said I still thought this movie was enjoyable. The movie is especially recommendable if you like old horror classics from Universal. The first few minutes are a great tribute to the classics however after that the classic horror characters are only used to impress the viewer with fancy special effects. There are some good action sequences but simply too much. After one hour I already had seen enough action and was surprised to see that I wasn't even halve way trough with watching the movie.Great special effects, great soundtrack and nice atmosphere but the story doesn't do much justice to the classic characters or the actors in this movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Van Helsing

31,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Definitely not great, but surely not as bad as some claim",5,26 May 2004,"This is a movie about the well-known famed monsters of the 1800's, mainly Dracula, The Wolfman and The Frankenstein Monster. While the original movies, and pretty much every movie about one of these creatures is a horror movie; this is, however, just a comic book movie that features them, and Dracula's nemesis, Van Helsing. It has no horror in it at all; several of the creatures in the film are ridiculed more than they're feared(well, mainly Igor, but at times Frankenstein's Monster too). The movie does do something to pay respect to the source material, but, alas, most of it is lost in special effects. Nearly every scene features some form of special effects; there are more effects in the film than there are action sequences. I don't know any other films by Stephen Sommers, but in this, the action consists of far too much CGI, thereby giving us something to look at, rather than something to be excited about; granted, the CGI does look pretty good, but some ""all-live action"" action sequences would really have helped. I also found the action scenes to be fairly repetitive. Half of them either start or end with someone being swung by a wire/rope/whatever. That's an OK idea for one or two action scenes, but in this movie, it happens no less than five times. Then it just gets tedious and bland. You start to wonder if the director has too few ideas for how to put together action scenes. It also made me wonder if he had seen too much Tarzan as a child, and wanted to copy him swinging from tree to tree. Most of the action scenes also involve far too much talking, and far too little action. There was a scene were the vampires kept talking on and on for five minutes or so, before finally attacking the victim, whom they had cornered from the beginning of the scene; of course, this only happens to the main characters, anyone else is killed instantly. Which just makes it all the more predictable; quite unfortunate, seeing as how it was seemingly made to create tension and intensity. The action scenes are fairly intense, but the director hardly ever gives us time to breath between them, thereby just annoying the viewer, rather than giving an intense feel to the film. The action, whilst being intense, fails to excite or entertain, which leaves the viewer feeling bored. The talking in the action scenes also usually kill any form of excitement, rather than intensify it. In fact, the film seems to prefer special effects over action; there were several scenes that could have become great action sequences, instead something ""unexpected"" happens, and we are ""treated"" with more CGI. They also seemed to love the things they could do with the special effects far too much, resulting in them overusing it to the extreme(main examples being Dracula's walking on walls and werewolves & Mr. Hyde jumping constantly from one place to another, which just annoys and distracts the viewer). The plot is OK, but very far-fetched and only barely makes sense. I got the feeling that the script was written more or less around which plot twists the director wanted(in fact, if I'm not mistaken, Sommers also wrote the script, as well as directing it), and which action/special effects sequences he wanted in the film. The acting is not particularly good, but not bad, either(well, some of it, but most of it is OK). The Monster has the delivery of an opera singer... I wasn't sure if I should laugh at the poor acting, or clap at the notes he hit. The characters seemed too much like clichés; the bad-ass hero who cracks jokes and saves the day, the strong female who can fight for herself, except for when she needs to be rescued by the hero, the slow, goofy sidekick who's only in the film(at all) to provide comic relief, etc. The humor in the film is decent, however there is a little too much of it for a dark film based on horror movies. A few of the jokes did make me laugh, however, the goofy nature of several scenes made me laugh harder. All in all, a decent comic book movie that lacks any of the serious nature of its source material. I recommend this movie to fans of comic book movies, but fans of any/all of the source material should be advised, that this does not pay very much respect to the original stories. Just remember; you were warned. 5/10",Van Helsing
32,view_and_review,"Van Helsing, CGI Hunter",6,6 March 2021,"""Van Helsing"" is an updated version of the Dracula fable. This version is a 19th century ""Lethal Weapon"" or just about any action movie from the 80's and 90's. There were explosions, gunfire, and even horse carriage chases in lieu of car chases. But the biggest problem was the heavy CGI.Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, the monster hunter. He works for an obscure order of the Catholic Church in charge of ridding the world of phantasmic evildoers. In its bowels there's an operation that rivals the gadget makers for 007. In this hidden lair you can see people busily working on new fangled doodads to help their field agents dispatch of the latest supernatural nuisance. Van Helsing's current mission is to go to Transylvania to kill Dracula before he eliminates the Valerious bloodline; a family who'd been hunting Dracula for centuries. By the time Van Helsing gets to Transylvania the only Valerious left is Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) as her brother had been converted to a werewolf.This movie goes for style over substance. It's clear they threw a lot of money into effects hoping they could dazzle enough moviegoers to make a killing. The CGI was good for '04, though it hasn't aged well.

From the opening sequence, which joyously and wittily, references the Universal horrors of the 30s and 40s, through to the final riding into the sunset, the movie is simply an adventurous romp.It makes great use of CGI and has enjoyable performances from all the principals (though Richard Roxburgh is perhaps miscast as Dracula).

Here you have another fine actor, underrated Hugh Jackman, playing Van Helsing, but you'd never get that by what goes on here.So Universal drags out every legendary horror character in their catalog - not just Dracula, who actually IS a vampire. They manage to incorporate the Frankenstein monster and The Werewolf too. Bring in the mummy, the invisible man, and the creature from the black lagoon and the gang would all be here. There really is no plot to speak of, just lots of flying female vamps so you can get some gratuitous nudity in, and then there is a plot line installed to lampoon Jackman's role as Wolverine over at Marvel.The bottom line - there must be something better you can do with your time.

Van Helsing is seen as a murderer because he hunts vampires, werewolves, Mr. Hyde, Barney, etc. He is joined by a woman whose brother was bitten by a werewolf. Director Stephen Sommers previously brought us The Mummy so handling action and big overwhelming special effects are to his advantage. Screenplays are not his strong point as The Mummy proves as does this film. Hugh Jackman plays Helsing as a reminder of his Wolverine role. He is given the background but not the followup and rapidly descends into action and combat scenes. The same thing with Kate Beckinsale who basically replays her Underworld role. Again, the background is there but the familiarity decreases chances of the role being unique. Only Richard Roxburgh as Dracula is remotely interesting along with Kevin J. O'Connor as the loyal Igor. Samuel West plays Dr. Victor Frankenstein who is only featured briefly. Only hard core comic book fans will truly appreciate this combination of monsters with special effects that pay off better than anything else in the film. With that said, it becomes one long geek show. Score: 6 / 10",Van Helsing
36,FlashCallahan,I'm staring at him....,6,7 February 2010,"Van Helsing finds a land still mired in past, where legendary creatures of darkness come to life. A place ruled over by the evil, seductive and unbeatable vampire, Count Dracula.It is Dracula that Van Helsing has been sent to terminate. Anna Valerious is one of the last of a powerful royal family, now nearly annihilated by Dracula.A fearless hunter in her own right, Anna is bent on avenging her ancestors and ending an ancient curse by killing the vampire. Joined by a common foe, Van Helsing and Anna set out to destroy Dracula along with his empire of fear.But in challenging an enemy who never dies, Van Helsing uncovers a secret he never imagined and comes face-to-face with the unresolved mysteries of his own enshrouded past....Van Helsing, or how to shoot dead a potential franchise, promised so so much, and delivered so very little. With all that is going on and some reasonable special effects, it boggles the mind to discover that the film is quite boring.Only Jackman puts in a worthy performance as the titular character, Beckinsale is just eye candy, and the less said about Roxburgh, the better (since when did Dracula become a new romantic?).This film suffers from the same syndrome Spiderman 3 and Schumachers Batmans suffered from, too many villains, and too much going on. There is a story going on somewhere, But Sommers goes down the CGI route too often, and relies on Jackman to put in a semi Wolverine part every now and again.But it has it's moments, The first twenty minutes are amazing, and really get the film going, but it all goes downhill rapidly from there. If the film didn't take itself so seriously, and was more tongue in cheek (there is humour, but not enough) it would have been an amazing film.but instead of amazing, it just happens, and then it's over.",Van Helsing
37,Aaron1375,A very good action movie...just not much of a plot.,8,11 May 2004,"I enjoyed this movie for the most part, it went by quick and was almost entirely action.  However, the plot could have used a lot of work.  Not the best put together movie I have ever seen and I would not think it would be that hard to put these horror legends together and have a credible plot, but I just did not care for Dracula's big plan.  James Bond villains have better plans than the one we were presented with here.  Still though the action was great and Hugh Jackman was good in the title role, though I would take Peter Cushing over him as my personal favorite.  I wish they had cast someone bigger in the Dracula role though, the guy they got was okay, but Oldman was better in the role than the one we get here.  Sure I know you can not use Christopher Lee anymore, but someone a touch more big in Hollywood would have been better.  But then there are not really all that many big stars for horror movies like there were back in the day.  My best advice is that if you liked the Mummy movies then you are more likely to like this one because they are similar.  If you did not like them then I know you will not like this one so skip it.  It is also best just to turn your brain off and just enjoy the action.",Van Helsing
38,Wuchakk,Big Dumb Blockbuster Monster Fun,6,26 November 2012,"Although writer/director Stephen Sommers had an unexpected hit with 1999's ""The Mummy,"" he went overKILL with the 2001 sequel ""The Mummy Returns,"" a prime example of modern blockbuster dreck that's full of explosions and ""exciting"" things going on, but somehow is strangely boring. That's the problem with 2004's ""Van Helsing,"" although not as bad.THE PLOT: In 1887 Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) teams up with Anna (Kate Beckinsale) in Transylvania to fight Dracula, his three lovely but vicious brides, the Frankenstein monster, werewolves, vampire babies, etc.It won't take long for the viewer to perceive that ""Van Helsing"" shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a partial parody/homage of the classic Universal monster movies and part serious, just barely. Imagine ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992) with the over-the-top thrills of Indiana Jones and the flair of classic monster parodies like ""The Vampire Happening"" (1971) or ""Young Frankenstein"" (1974) and you'd have a good approximation.The film looks good, but there's too much CGI and some of the monsters look really cartoony, like Mr. Hyde and the werewolves. Others look quite good, like the flying vampire brides and Frankenstein's monster. As was the case with ""The Mummy Returns"" the film is strangely tedious despite all the manic happenings. Thankfully, there are worthy hints of depth, e.g. the Frankenstein monster and Anna. I wish there was more.Speaking of Anna, Kate Beckinsale is definitely one of the highlights here as she looks stunning throughout in an amazing form-fitting costume and thigh-high boots seemingly appropriate for the late 1800s (speaking as someone who's not even a Beckinsale fan). Josie Maran and Elena Anaya are also striking as two of Dracula's wives, Marishka and Aleera. Needless to say, excellent job on the female front. On the other side of the spectrum, Jackman is a great, masculine leading man, perfect for the role. Richard Roxburgh (Dracula), David Wenham (Carl), Kevin J. O'Connor (Igor) and Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein's monster) are all entertaining or effective.At the end of the day, though, ""Van Helsing"" barely rises above the limitations of what it is: a big, dumb modern blockbuster with all its over-the-top trappings. Considering the $160 million thrown into it, it shoulda/coulda been better. The story needed time to breathe and less constant mania. The movie's also over-long at 2 hours and 11 minutes. Still, it's better than ""The Mummy Returns"" and there's enough here to make it worthwhile, if you're in the mood for this type of fare.THE FILM WAS SHOT in the Czech Republic, Rome and Paris with studio work done in Southern Cal and Orlando, Florida.GRADE: B-/C+",Van Helsing
39,The_Void,"Classic horror writers, actors and directors turn in their graves",3,12 January 2005,"The idea behind this film comes off the back of this recent trend of blending together different stories to make one lesser story; the stories in question being, principally; those of Dracula, Frankenstein and The Wolf Man. From this premise, you can't expect 'greatness', but you can expect a fun romp and, suffice to say, this film doesn't even deliver on that front; as it's action-fuelled monster antics get tiresome very quickly indeed. Stephen Sommers has basically done what he did with The Mummy, in that he's taken an existing story and added CGI effects, only this time the result is a miserable mess of a film with absolutely terrible CGI and a complete lack of intrigue from the characters and the plot line. The muddled plot basically follows Count Dracula, who has decided to enlist the help of Baron Frankenstein, along with a werewolf to help him in his plot to do...something. Enter Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman); the intelligent (or not, in this case) monster hunter that goes on Dracula's tail along with an irritating priest and a Princess (played by the beautiful Kate Beckinsale) and what follows is what should be an entertaining monster mash, but what is actually a dull, cliché ridden, action film with little or nothing of what made it's influences great.Dracula has been turned from a malevolent conglomeration of evil into a comic book villain. Frankenstein's Monster has taken way too much of the emotional side that Karloff portrayed so brilliantly in 'Bride of Frankenstein' and is little more than a pathetic mess of a character. The way that the werewolves are integrated into the story is actually quite good, but that's shot down in flames by the fact that the wolves themselves look ridiculous. Whoever decided that CGI was the best way to do effects wants shooting; it looks rubbish, and the only reason I can think of why it's used is to save valuable time that would have been used creating real effects. If you want evidence of how NOT to do special effects, see the Mr Hyde sequence towards the start. Absolutely awful. The title character is nothing like the character that Bram Stoker wrote for him. I don't even know why they chose to use the name 'Van Helsing' anyway, most of the target audience will have never have heard of him and since he's nothing like the character that the likes of Peter Cushing and Anthony Hopkins portrayed so well, they might as well have simply made a new monster hunter for the film. Then I wouldn't have been bothered about him being called 'Gabriel' instead of 'Abraham'. Kate Beckinsale could have been the film's saving grace, but even Mrs sweetness herself isn't herself in this awful film. I don't know if it's the terrible accent, the rubbish haircut or the daft outfits; but she's nothing like the ultra sexy character she played in the surprisingly good 'Underworld'.Basically, what we have here is a film that was made by a man that thought he had an idea that was good enough to carry a film on it's own. The complete lack of ideas and reliance on changes to the original characters shows that, and this is a very sad motion picture indeed. You may have gone into this expecting something of a tribute to the great horror classics, but this film features little in the way of horror at all. If you ever wanted to see a film that showed beyond doubt that CGI isn't the way to create good effects, this is the film to see. But since you don't want to see a film like that, you have no reason to see 'Van Helsing'. My advice is to avoid this trash at all costs.",Van Helsing
40,mm-39,Just Ok,6,14 May 2004,"A bit too fantasy, but a few good tributes.  There is some homage to a couple of Frankenstien movies, and Christopher Lee vampier movies.  I did not mind some of this film, and some of the story, but this movie gets dorkey like Harry Ptter, The Matrix, and Lord of the Rings.  I like the pace of this film, very fast like the Dawn of the Dead remake. When I compare Van Helsing to the Dawn remake the story becomes fantasy/dork and lose a bit of the grit or realism that scares me from the Dawn of the Dead or Chainsaw remake.  This is a good rental, but a little too over explained story line. Should of keep one guessing, and a little more nastier, instead of shocking. Remind me of the Batman movie, I mean Batman one from 89.  The effects were ok.  Too many by the number type film out like this, but better than others 6 out of 10",Van Helsing
41,HumanoidOfFlesh,Typical brainless so-called 'horror film' for mainstream audience.,2,18 August 2005,"""Van Helsing"" is easily one of the worst so-called 'horror films' of 2004.Why people compare this CGI-laden piece of crap to Universal classics or Hammer vampire movies is beyond me.Instead of focusing on suspense the film is loaded with tons of unimpressive CGI-imagery.The script is painfully weak and the characters are totally one-dimensional.Admittedly,the opening scene is pretty good as it follows a mob of angry villagers as they storm Dr.Frankenstein's castle.It's shot in black and white andfor a little while,anywaycaptures the eerie,fog-ridden atmosphere of such horror staples as ""Frankenstein"" and ""The Wolf Man"".After this short prologue we meet Van Helsing and the film quickly becomes stupefying mess.The dialogue is particularly atrocious and there is no suspense or gore,just lots of loud noises and computer animated vampires and werewolves.The film may be entertaining for popcorn eaters,but everyone who calls himself or herself a true horror fan will hate it.2 out of 10.Avoid this travesty like the plague.",Van Helsing

The Action Set-Pieces, as well as The Graphics, are excellent. Stephen Sommers's Screenplay, however, is not full-proof. Luckily, the fun quotient & the thrill remains in-tact.

44,Smells_Like_Cheese,An undecided vote,5,11 May 2004,"OK, after reading and hearing 50/50 of votes for and against ""Van Helsing"", I still wanted to see it. I took my mom to see it yesterday after it making a killing at the box office. I am still in a tose. I'm not sure whether I liked it or not. It's kind of like ""Signs"", I just don't know if it was good or bad. There was things I liked, Frankenstein's character, Igor, the special effects, and the interesting story. But there were some things I didn't like, Kate Beckingsale's character, they tried to make some of the side kick's funny when they couldn't, and the lame and predictable plots of the story. Over all, you should judge for yourself. I can't really say whether this is a movie ultimatley worth seeing. But it's based on what you enjoy: computer effects or a story. If you want the computer effects, this is the movie for you. If you want a full story, it may not work for you.

45,Rainey-Dawn,Action Please!,8,25 June 2014,I don't care what the critics say I LOVE THE FILM! Van Helsing is a good fantasy horror film - an action-packed adventure! The action in the film is worth watching even if you are not keen on the plot of this movie. I for one thought the story was very nice and a great Gothic atmosphere! I thoroughly enjoyed this version of the vampire-hunter Van Helsing - he was cool. Hugh Jackman is well suited for this role! And he picked the perfect romantic interest Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale)! One of the highlights of the film is the romance between Anna and Van Helsing.This film is great to watch on an day when you are in the mood for the classic movie monsters and a lot of action! 8.5/10,Van Helsing

47,Buddy-51,so-so action film,5,22 July 2005,"""Van Helsing"" is a campy, tongue-in-cheek homage to the three key figures of classic movie horror - Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man - and those who do them battle. Hugh Jackman is the mysterious Van Helsing, a centuries-old monster-slayer who works sub rosa for the Catholic Church in its ongoing battle with the forces of evil. In this tale, Van Helsing is sent off to Transylvania to destroy the famed Count Dracula, a vampire who's been rampaging through the countryside for more than four hundred years now, making life miserable for the inhabitants therein.Written and directed by Stephen Sommers, ""Van Helsing"" is a sometimes entertaining, sometimes half-baked adventure tale, beautiful to look at but largely devoid of any real suspense or excitement. The action scenes are overwrought and redundant, filled with computer-generated special effects that are surprisingly second-rate in nature. However, the art direction and set design do an outstanding job creating a Transylvania that plays upon our memories of those Universal classics from the 1930's. Moreover, David Wenham serves as an effective cowardly/comic Sancho Panza-type sidekick for the more staid and conventionally heroic Van Helsing, who suffers pangs of remorse when he is forced to destroy the monsters.The final battle scene between Van Helsing and Dracula does drag on for a minor eternity, but the movie, overall, should satisfy rabid fans of the action film genre. The rest of us can find intermittent entertainment gawking at the scene.",Van Helsing
48,thesar-2,Wild Wild East,5,23 May 2018,"Fun fact: the basic telephone was invented before the events in this film. This led us all to believe Hugh Jackman could have easily phoned his performance in, in-between Wolverine performances. Annnd he did.Please ignore the terrible CGI. And yeah, it's probably the worst you'll ever see. (Why oh why didn't they make this animated????!) The movie, unlike many films, actually gets progressively better.I grew up on ""monster movies."" In my household, it had to be as G-rated as possible, like the 1930's Universal monsters to the 50s-70s Godzilla films. So, it was kinda nice to rekindle with many of the bigger name Universal monsters here. With the help of a comedic-sidekick, I could make it through to the end.The Film's Title has a past he can't remember and believably, it doesn't really matter. He's just out to rid the Earth of baddies. Apparently, he's never been sent up against the original horror villain, Dracula, so let's make this movie. Oh, and he'll need Underworld, the horror version of Q and Young Frankenstein's clone to take on Bram Stoker's sorta creation of destruction. Honestly, this is good for kids. Really, really young ones. Older ones would scoff at the terrible graphics. It's not a bad movie, per se, it's just so horribly drawn due to the fifty cents spent on the special effects. Too bad...because they're laughably bad and distracting. The movie's harmless, really. It's not superior, but everyone's, well, HEART is in the right place. ***Final thoughts: A friend recommended this to me. I instantly complained on how bad the CGI was on the Werewolves. Literally, I have not seen this movie since theatres 14 years ago and that's all l I could recount. Well, that and that I thought it was just okay. Watching it for only the second time in nearly a decade and a half, I realized, it's not THAT bad of a film and there were FAR WORSE CGI shots than just the werewolf scenes.

49,cherold,equal parts exciting and absurd,7,16 April 2005,"I love director Stephen Sommers because of his apparent love for 40s B-movie thrillers, and perhaps that's why other people don't like him. It seems that a bad action movie with a modern sensibility like Spider-Man is always better received than a fun, distinctly old-fashioned picture like The Mummy. I don't know what to make of it.Like The Mummy, Van Helsing got more bad reviews than it deserved, although admittedly it does have problems. The movie is best at the very beginning in a black and white sequence evoking the old Frankenstein/Dracula movies of the 40s while tossing in 21st century special effects. This is classic Sommers. It then changes to color, for no discernible reason except you can't make a whole movie in black and white in 2004.Action scenes are incredibly exciting. The movie is big and fast and monster transformations happen with a tremendous speed that makes them at times startling. Hugh Jackman is great and Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous.But while Van Helsing is exciting, it fails miserably at being scary. This is the movie's weak point. The vampire's hover between scary and camp, not quite landing at either point. So what should be eerie or terrifying just comes across as silly. It feels as though Sommers realized he couldn't get scary and so played some scenes for laughs, but he couldn't give up the idea of making things scary so he kept trying, basically fighting against himself.One also has pretty much no feeling for the characters. This is perhaps the main difference between Van Helsing and those old horror movies, which mixed a sense of tragedy and loss into the thrills. But for all its flaws, the movie has that roller-coaster thrill ride sensibility that keeps a smile on your face.",Van Helsing
50,bensonmum2,I can't believe some people actually like this stuff,2,30 August 2005,"Renowned monster hunter Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to deal with Dracula and his vampire minions. The Catholic Church is worried about protecting its Eastern flank from the spread of evil. But Van Helsing has never faced a creature quite like Dracula. And Dracula proves to be only one of his worries. Van Helsing must also take care of Dracula's vampire brides, a werewolf, and Frankenstein's monster.What Works: Kate Beckinsale. Is there any need to explain why? What Doesn't Work: The Monsters. I'm sure that James Whale is spinning in his grave.Hugh Jackman. Can anyone be more dull and lifeless? I really wish the movie hadn't been called Van Helsing because then there might have been a chance his character would die.Everything Else. There are so many things wrong with the movie that I really don't know where to begin. I suppose I'll start with the incredible overuse of CGI. Nothing in this movie looks real. As a result, people, animals, and objects all behave in a manner that seems completely inconsistent with any known laws of physics (or at least my very rudimentary understanding of physics). For example, a person simply cannot fall from the heights that the people in Van Helsing do without either becoming severely injured or dying. It's not possible. Yet Van Helsing would have the viewer believe that a person can drop from the height of a two-story building over and over without so much as a scratch. I don't even remember anyone getting their hair messed up  unlike much of this movie.I want to take this opportunity to apologize to the people who made Freddy vs. Jason. I recently criticized it for being without any redeeming value. Van Helsing is exponentially more ridiculous than Freddy vs. Jason. Why do I keep subjecting myself to this stuff?",Van Helsing

53,bowmanblue,"Good, but somehow not as great as it should be",7,2 September 2014,"'Van Helsing' has always been a bit of an enigma to me. I own it and have watched it every so often and I can never quite put my finger on what exactly is wrong with it. Obviously, I quite like it, but it always leaves me with the feeling that it should have - somehow - been so much better.The film was practically made for me - I love Hugh Jackman and he makes a great 'monster hunter.' Kate Beckinsale is naturally sexy as his kick-a$$ love interest. David Wenham adds some comic relief as Van Helsing and Richard Roxborough is brilliantly campy as Count Dracula. Then there are more monsters crammed into this film than Jabba the Hutt's palace. What more could I want? Um, I don't exactly know, but I'm not alone in my confusion. Van Helsing was supposed to be the start of some sort of action/horror franchise. It was certainly given the budget and star-power to launch such a venture. However, it was - almost - a financial flop. It was sort of successful, but not enough to get a proper sequel (there is a lower budget animated one, but that wasn't the original intention).Perhaps it's the overuse of CGI? Sometimes everything on screen starts to blur into one mass of animation. Perhaps it's that the characters are a little too indestructible to be believable. Seriously... these (supposedly totally human) characters get dropped from great heights again and again and just get up like nothing has happened - a minor gripe, but it always bugged me.If you're a fan of 'old school' horror, i.e. you know about the Dracula/Frankenstein myths then you might like this, because it certainly pays homage to the classics. It has a lot of charm (kudos to Frankenstein's monster and Drac himself), but somehow falls slightly short of being the modern day classic it was meant to be.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Van Helsing
54,dromasca,a computer graphics Gothic film,7,28 November 2004,"'Van Helsing' is a remarkable film from a technical point of view. Computer graphics in films became a major trend lately, and the borders between classic animation, computer animation and acting become more and more blurred. If you doubt, just see the four animation films in the US top ten this week, and computer effects playing a visible role in at least another two. As I said, I liked, actually was captivated by the endless imagination in the computer work in this film, and this kept me interested despite the length of the film. Sure, there is not too much originality in 'Van Helsing'. We get a very strong mix of many of the horror stories of the 19th century. The only original idea was re-defining the Vatican as the host of the bigger spy agency of the epoch. The film even has a Mister Q as an important supporting character. Acting is not too bad, but the quality of the film lies mostly in the Gothic atmosphere, the infinite number of monsters, and the landscape created by computer means. Certainly, it is just comics-level geography and history. Do not expect any historic or geographic truth here. Transylvania for example for whoever is interested is 500 kilometers away from any sea. But who cares. I enjoyed 'Van Helsing' more than I expected. However, I dislike the idea of a second film, and the producers would make a big mistake to try to create a sequel. It can't be better than the original in its genre. I am however sure that they did not wait for my advice, and are already doing it to capitalize on the momentum :-) 'Van Helsing' gets 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",Van Helsing
55,MLDinTN,no wonder it was such a box office flop,3,16 April 2005,"There's not a lot I can say that is positive about this movie. The only thing I liked were some of the werewolf scenes because they didn't look totally like a video game unlike Mr. Jeckyl, who looked ridiculous. Hugh Jackman must have signed to do this movie solely for the paycheck since he's usually in good to descent films. Kate Beckinsale chose to do this even after the stupid Underworld. And as most people have already said, her accent was horrible. Dracula was way-over acted. It was one of the worst Dracula's that's been on film. It's like the director couldn't decide if he wanted his Dracula to be comical or taken seriously.Part of the plot involves Dracula needing Frankenstein to use as a power source to bring his flying ""children"" to life. Those were some of the stupidest monsters I've seen. And his brides were terrible CGI when they were shown flying also.As for the action/fighting scenes: they were terrible. Most of them were beyond unrealistic. Many of the scenes involving Anna, showed her jumping around almost like Ang Lee's Hulk. And she does all this amazing kung fu and falls 10 stories but never gets hurt.FINAL VERDICT: Terrible action, abysmal story, mostly stupid special effects. Basically a waste of a large sum of money.",Van Helsing
56,Cineanalyst,Dracula Meets the Wolverine,7,10 July 2018,"Despite being thinly scripted in parts, overly plotted in others, and CGI bloated, ""Van Helsing"" might be the best monster-rally movie since the original Universal series, from its initial crossover feature, ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" (1943), to its turn into self-parody beginning with ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"" (1948)--although my favorite may be Columbia's ""The Return of the Vampire (1943), which, akin to ""Van Helsing,"" is a Dracula Meets Wolf Man monster rally in all but name. Albeit, being the best monster-rally fare since the 1940s or so, which has included the kiddie ""The Monster Squad"" (1987), the prior-year's summer blockbuster, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (2003), and a host of B-to-Z-grade pictures, is not a high bar to surpass. In retrospect, ""Van Helsing"" also plays a bit like a warm up to Universal's subsequent attempts to launch a new Dark Universe, that being ""Dracula Untold"" (2014) and ""The Mummy"" (2017), except that the warm up is actually better than the latter results.À la ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" Dracula has an evil plan for Frankenstein's monster, but, once again, werewolves (and, it could be argued, some other dimwits) are trying to thwart him. In an homage to the classic Universal horror films, the opening sequence of ""Van Helsing"" is in black and white and rehashes Dr. Frankenstein's creation of the monster, complete with a pitchfork mob chasing them to a fiery climax in a windmill. For a while, ""Van Helsing"" seems rather haphazard in its touching upon other classic monsters, including scenes of Van Helsing fighting Mr. Hyde (who is more like a mix of The Hunchback of Notre Dame--literally that's his location--and, as in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" a weak version of Marvel's the Hulk rather than the character from Stevenson's novella), of some werewolf hunters and of a small village being terrorized by vampires. There's also some stuff with Igor, a gravedigger, vampire brides and baby vampire bats. Probably the biggest problem with the movie is that it spends time with too much clutter while not delving too deep into the characters and storylines that really count.Van Helsing merely retains the name of Stoker's character. Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing is no Dutch doctor, but rather an 1880s James Bond type working for Vatican as a hitman of monsters. The friar Carl stands in for the ""Q"" character from the Bond films, as he shows Van Helsing the latest in fictional-Victorian-era weapons technology. Strangely, Carl is also more like Stoker's Van Helsing than the actual character by that name in this movie, as he's the one with all of the answers and knowledge related to vampire hunting. Jackman's Van Helsing, on the other hand, at first, wonders why he can't just shoot the Count with his guns. Like Jackman's Wolverine from the X-Men movie series, his Van Helsing is a semi-immortal with memory loss who recklessly rushes into a fight, relies upon the intelligence of others, whether it be a Carl or Charles Xavier, struggles with the risks between heroism and evil capable from his rage-infused superpowers and with the tragic possibilities of his romantic relationship with a female sidekick, whether it be Anna Valerious or Jean Grey.As for this movie's Dracula, I'm fairly satisfied with it. I've been watching a bunch of Dracula-related films since reading the novel, and I'm tired of all of the weak or otherwise lovesick bastardizations of Stoker's titular villain. Stoker's Dracula was pure evil. In the 1931 Universal version, Bela Lugosi added camp to the role. At least, Richard Roxburgh's Dracula evokes some of Stoker and Lugosi's traditions, and he's an especially strong vampire. Whereas Van Helsing is a rehash of Wolverine, I can see a bit of the absurdity of Roxburgh's Duke from ""Moulin Rouge!""--which along with the absinthe in the windmill and the visual excess, ""Moulin Rouge!"" seems to have especially influenced this movie. Mixed with the goofiness throughout from director Stephen Sommers, who had already done likewise in rebooting ""The Mummy"" series, this one can be fun. The Frankenstein monster, on the other hand, was somewhat of a sympathetic character even in Shelley's book, but he's overly such here. No explanation is given for his eloquent speech, either; even the classic Universal movies, for as much as they departed from the source material, addressed his acquisition of language.The visual effects are well integrated with the the framing and its movement--what is traditionally done with the camera, but which is increasingly being done by computers. Only a few years later than ""Van Helsing,"" five movies that relied heavily upon computers for their imagery, ""camera"" movement and lighting were seemingly-oxymoronically awarded Oscars for Best Cinematography: ""Avatar"" (2009), ""Inception"" (2010), ""Hugo"" (2011), ""Life of Pi"" (2012) and ""Gravity"" (2013). ""Van Helsing"" is part of a prior generation of combining live action and CGI and camera and digital photography, but at least the ""camera"" moves some, including following Dracula as he walks up walls (much more casually than the wall crawler of Stoker, by the way) or keeping abreast of the vampires flying in their humanoid-bat forms. Such a sense of the role of the camera in the mix of live action and CGI was lacking from the prior year's monster rally, ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,"" so ""Van Helsing"" was certainly an improvement upon that, delivering an action movie that's actually visually enthralling.(Mirror Note: Dracula displays his and other vampires' lack of reflections to Anna as he dances with her before a mirror in a vampire ball sequence that somewhat recalls a similar scene in Roman Polanski's ""Dance of the Vampires,"" a.k.a. ""The Fearless Vampire Hunters"" (1967). A mirror is also used in another scene as a gateway.)",Van Helsing
57,g-bodyl,Interesting Movie!,8,31 December 2011,"Through the first half hour of the film, I could not tell if I was going to like or hate this film. It has such a great premise but the execution for the first part was horrid. Not to mention that the guy who played Dracula was horrible. Then for the final hour and a half, I enjoyed the movie.If you like the old horror movies from the 1930's, you will certainly like this. It's about Van Helsing, the vampire hunter whose mission is to kill Dracula.Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were the highlights of the film. They are both talented actors. However, I though Richard Roxburgh was miscast as Dracula. He played a pretty bad Dracula.Overall, this is a pretty good special-effects laden film. Is it worthy of an 8? I don't think so but I gave it one to bring the overall IMDb rating up.",Van Helsing
58,lesleyharris30,"Had so Much More Potential,",5,14 July 2014,"Van Helsing is a mediocre movie with a decent storyline and a good cast.The movie is certainly a disappointed,a Van Helsing movie with Hugh Jackman in the title role immediately sounds like a great new franchise,but unfortunately so many aspects of this movie were done wrong.I felt like the writers just tried to throw in any famous horror characters they could think of,from Dracula,Mr. Hyde and Frankenstein,it would have been so much better if it just focused on Dracula,and certainly would have been better without that ridiculous werewolf side story.The CGI in this film is very unrealistic,you could tell these characters were animated and it didn't feel like they were communicating with the real actors at all.Also the humour isn't very subtle in this movie,I also appreciate a bit of comedy in an action movie but it was too common in this and was rarely genuinely funny,the character of Carl was definitely only there for comic relief,but I didn't laugh at a single thing he said.Van Helsing has its moments,but is overall not a very good movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone.

60,inkblot11,"Part horror, part hoot....stunning visual effects and a slyly comic performance by Jackman",6,21 December 2006,"Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a monster hunter who achieves results, through luck and weaponry. When he is sent to take down, once and for all, the evil Count Dracula, it is an all out war with the denizens of the count's castle, including Frankenstein, werewolves, and vampires by the dozens. Only Anna (Kate Beckingsale), a young noblewoman whose brother was changed into a vampire by Dracula, is on Helsing's side. How in the world will the two of the them win out? Part horror, part hoot, this movie is a fun watch for an evening. Jackman is just right as the monster hunter with the sardonic wit of a stand-up comic. Beckinsale is a more serious but worthy supporting cast member. The film is visually stunning, even in an age of computer generating effects. Just watch a lady vampire swoop down and scoop up prey or a werewolf change in the moonlight. Younger children should probably not watch the film, for it has scary images. But, teens and adults will hardly be afraid for long, as Jackman cuts everyone down to size with his words.

They have been sent to this land to stop the powerful Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) Whilst there they join forces with Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) who is determined to end an ancient curse on her family by destroying the vampire. Based on the opening ten minutes I thought this was going to be an FX overload like ""The League Of Extraordinary Gentleman"" but in the end I I thoroughly enjoyed myself and most of that is down to Hugh Jackman. He has a natural charm, that few movie stars have. He is a good looking man with charisma in spades . Oh and he happens to be one hell of an actor. David Wenham gets a lot of the laughs as the sidekick, and Kate Beckinsale indeed looks great. I'm surprised this didn't lead to at least one sequel.",Van Helsing

Van Helsing is an incredible film!,10,25 October 2004,"Van Helsing, one of My most anticipated movies and it was everything that I thought it would be and more! I think the film is a great one! Everyone one who is in this movie acted very good. Hugh Jackman was great as Van Helsing. He was very believable! Kate Beckinsale also was good and her accent was cool. Richard Roxburgh was excellent and he arguably had the best performance and his look as Dracula was neat. Shuler Hensley was great as Frankenstein's Monster! Samuel West was also great as Dr. Frankenstein and it was outstanding how much he looked like Colin Clive! Kevin J. O'Connor was also great as Igor. Will Kemp was good as the Werewolf. The three Brides played by Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca, and Josie Maran were excellent and they have a lot of screen time. It is amazing how they look in their vampire forms! Robbie Coltrane was good as Mr. Hyde! Also in good performances are Alun Armstrong and David Wenham. I just couldn't believe how great this movie is. The beginning of it is incredible! The sound is spectacular and I can't recall a film with sound like this! The musical score by Alan Silvestri is phenomenal! Arguably the greatest score he has ever written and in My opinion one of the greatest scores ever! The special effects are awesome and in My opinion everything looks real! The directing by Stephen Sommers is great! I think Van Helsing is one of the best movies and truly one of the most exciting films. If you like the cast mentioned above, love Sommer's The Mummy films, and want to see some incredible action involving Van Helsing, Dracula, Werewolves, Frankenstein's Monster, Mr. Hyde, Dracula's Brides, and more then I strongly recommend that you do what I did and buy this excellent movie today!",Van Helsing
64,Dr_Coulardeau,Surprisingly FUNNY BUT SHALLOW,8,20 January 2008,"When you want to make one more film on Dracula who counts several hundred films already, both as assets and as drawbacks, you have to be original. No problem ! Let's patchwork together dozens of allusions to other films and create the first ever vampiristic salad. So Dr Frankenstein and his creature will be there. The use of the lightning to get electricity like in Back to the Future 1. The use of strange weapons halfway between Back to the Future 3 and The Lord of the Rings. The costume, dress, apparel of Van Helsing looks like Clint Eastwood's in a spaghetti western, and at times like the main hero's in the Matrix trilogy. The cows in the village are similar to those in Salem's Lot 2. Even the dance scene with the vampire reflected in a half empty mirror is borrowed from Dance of the Vampires. I would need a volume to quote them all. So what's left after all that composing of tidbits? A superhero Van Helsing who kills Dracula's three fiancées, the thousands of baby vampires that look like upside down Aliens in their suspended pods, and Dracula himself. And all that on the order from the Vatican, the Pope and the good old godly Catholic church. That's a counter-allusion to the Da Vinci Code. The film then is more dictated in its plot by the brand new topnotch state of the art digitalized image processing of the modern world than the reverse. So the plot is a vast ballet between mountains and from abysses to cosmic skies. It is thus an amusing entertainment as shallow as the Thames River twenty kilometers before its spring. Or is it the Mississippi river? Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Van Helsing
65,poe426,SOLOMON KANE rip-off...,3,2 February 2005,"Anyone familiar with Robert E. Howard's SOLOMON KANE will recognize VAN HELSING for what it is: a rip-off, plain and simple (with emphasis on the ""simple""). The prologue, which promised much, fizzled miserably much too soon and proved, unfortunately, a portent of things to come. While I must confess I thought Jackman was great in the two X-MEN movies, he seems miscast here: the director might just as well have stood a mannequin before the camera; it would've been cheaper, I'm sure-and the overall effect would've been about the same. And the awful cgi only make matters worse: the movie virtually(!) turns into a video game whenever anything remotely interesting starts to happen, with fx so cheesy that one wonders why the producers didn't simply render the entire feature thus. Why bother with live action at all if you're that gung-ho for computer graphics? TOY STORY and SHREK (among others) have confirmed the viability of cgi features. Anyone out there familiar with anime...? Or, say, Richard Corben's DEN- a series of stories that would lend themselves readily to this particular form? There's a veritable plethora of untapped material floating around that would make good cgi fodder. Dispense with the flesh-and-blood folks and get busy with some real animation, if that's what you're interested in doing...",Van Helsing
66,johnnyboyz,Universal Horror for Dummies.,5,30 September 2007,"It would seem that when Kate Beckinsale is taking time out from fighting vampires and werewolves in an Underworld film, she's...........fighting vampires and werewolves in a Van Helsing film. In fact, that pretty much sums up not only four years of Kate's career but also the film of Van Helsing as a whole  a film that makes numerous mistakes yet makes up for it in the form of feel good, guilty action; a film that is loud and brave yet is incidental and one tracked. Director Stephen Sommers successfully re-invented another Karloff classic in 1999 by name of The Mummy; this was followed by a fun but not as good sequel called The Mummy Returns and then by a real piece of entertainment/trash called The Scorpion King. Right at the very beginning though, Sommers himself played a directorial version of Dr. Frankenstein and meshed together two 1970s action films called Alien and The Poseidon Adventure to create Deep Rising  another one of his failures. This final example is rather relevant to Van Helsing since it's a re-invention of Universal's classical era monsters.A lot of the content in Van Helsing just feels copied, either from an older horror film or something else. The opening scene is rather insulting to the 1930s Frankenstein films, the scene in which Van Helsing (Jackman) is introduced to the gadgets and his overall mission is reminiscent of a James Bond 'Q' and 'M' scene and the whole film in general just feels like a cross between 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen' and 'Shrek'. I feel sorry for the people who hadn't seen any Universal horror films before they saw this. I really enjoyed Frankenstein and The Bride of Frankenstein from the 1930s  even Branagh's 1994 version was outgoing and experimental (although it just 'felt' poorly made in the end) but Van Helsing as a film is just a dumbed down version of a would be franchise waiting to be re-injected at a time of big budget, CGI fun-fests. Yes, I 'got' the references to previous films: when The Monster states 'Friend!' and when the 'It's Alive' quote is muttered at the very beginning but the film is so dumbed down, we need to be 'reminded' that Vampires don't like sunlight; that Werewolves need to be killed with silver bullets and that the full moon transforms them  no doubt newcomers to these villains will be in awe: ""Wow! That's a really cool  they thought of everything."" True, only these are 70 year old concepts you're gushing at.The film also suffers from within in the form of blatant mistakes and a poorly structured narrative. First, the character of The Monster is more reminiscent to that of an opera singer given the way he is almost singing his lines like a tenor rather than mumbling through the film in true 'body parts made form dead men and the mind of a murderer' fashion. Also, during one scene Anna (Beckinsale) jumps off a walkway onto a rope above a boiling pot of chemicals when two enemies are coming for her: why the hell does she do this? The two foot soldiers are small and beatable yet she does the tricky thing and jumps onto a rope. She ends up defeating them on the rope anyway but it seemed a pointless excuse for an action scene of some sort. Secondly; after a carriage chase through the woods at night, the very next scene is daylight as one character consoles another on the ground yet the flying woman/vampire bat is exposed to it on the cliff-edge. The fact the film switches from night to day so quickly AND has the vampire in the daylight is laughable. Again, a poor excuse for an action scene of some sort and the scene where the sidekick solves everything towards the end in about a minute was ridiculous.Van Helsing is really just a film for the people who missed the first Universal horror franchise and if they do decide to track down the 1930s and beyond films then they'll probably be disappointed with them which in a way is sad and unfortunate. The effects are good and the fight scenes entertaining in a way but it's nothing more than a Deep Rising of Universal Horror.",Van Helsing
67,filipemanuelneto,"A bad script and bad direction, a film that could have been better but that's not all bad.",4,28 April 2016,"This film portrays Van Helsing's efforts to fight Dracula, which is now trying to give life to his children through the research of the late Doctor Frankenstein. Directed and written by Stephen Sommers, this adventure film has the participation of Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh and Shuler Hensley in the lead roles.There are certain adventure films, inspired by horror movies, that makes a jumble of elements and characters that have nothing to do with each other. This is one of those films, mixing Dracula to Frankenstein's monster. Even Dr. Jekyll (and his alter-ego, Mr. Hyde) enters the movie! This is not new, has been done in other films and works well when it's done carefully, but definitely wasn't the case here. The script is confusing and makes an attempt to transform Van Helsing, originally a Dutch professor with taste for the occult, in a kind of good supernatural entity destined to hunt down and kill evil monsters. Sorry, but the way this character ended up being ""deconstructed"" was wrong. The director/writer could have made other more interesting options like keeping Van Helsing more faithful to Stoker's novel and try to frame him in a story in the current time, perhaps. The truth is that this film is a clear script error, resulting of flying imagination of its director/screenwriter.The actors were good in their roles, without surprises or special highlights, except perhaps Shuler Hensley, who played a character far from the usual monster, in constant psychological conflict because of his horrid appearance and inner humanity and goodness. The accent of some characters wasn't well done and if the idea was to make them closer to the Romanian universe (when is usually located Dracula's Castle), it failed and became them more humorous than they can be at certain supposedly dramatic moments. The setting, costumes, makeup and sound, visual and special effects are too imaginative, like coming out of a Marvell comic or a graphic novel. The soundtrack, despite the good performance, also didn't stand out particularly.This film is well seeing and entertaining, but doesn't bring big surprises or positively impresses the audience. Far from being a good movie, is ordinary and we see it without big pleasure or expectation.",Van Helsing
68,Rectangular_businessman,A truly bad movie,2,5 March 2012,"I don't think this movie was underrated or under-appreciated in any way...In fact, I think that this movie deserves way more criticism and more bad reviews. Personally, I don't think that were anything remotely funny or interesting about this movie: It is true that the plot seem like something borrowed from a cheap, ""B"" movie, but, unlike those cheap flicks, ""Van Helsing"" feels terribly forced, dull, and, the worst of it is that is incredibly boring.Yes, it is boring. The plot is filled with all the elements from summer blockbusters and also it is so incredibly over the top that somebody could expect this to be entertaining, at least. Sadly, instead of that, ""Van Helsing"" feels just idiotic and endless, with unfunny jokes, unmotivated action scenes, a plot that goes nowhere, flat characters that are very hard to relate. Honestly, I don't what Stephen Sommers was trying to do with this movie: If this was supposed to be an homage to all the classic monster histories, it just fails, mostly because of the immense amount of ""liberties"" that he took about the whole mythology that exists around all the characters that appear in this movie. Most of those change seem gratuitous, or just made in order to make everything ""cooler"" for the modern audience. (I think that could be done without reaching this level of ridiculousness, that put this on the same level of other cinematic disasters, such as ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" from Stephen Norrington, or ""The Brothers Grimm"" from Terry Gilliam) Avoid it.I think that ""Van Helsing"" was the first vampire movie to be this bad.

In my opinion, it's a perfect pop-corn movie to watch at midnight cable when there is nothing else to watch. The movie has plenty of action that will keep the audience interested in what will happen next. I know, the plot is somehow dedicated for a younger audience but still uses elements from Horror movies from the 50's or 60's. The abuse of CGI use is not welcomed because it takes away the essence of classic Horror movies but still helps to create a candy for the eye movie.I watched this on the theater and I cay say I spent 90 minutes of mindless entertainment. I left my brain at home and enjoyed mediocre entertainment. I won't probably watch it ever again but I will keep in mind that it's not as terrible as many others say. It does not try to be a Horror movie. I think that the best thing about the movie is the performance of the actor who portrayed Dracula. The man was likable. The f/x were over the top but still had some cool features. This movie reminded me of the Castlevania video games mostly because of it's visuals and action sequences.

73,FiendishDramaturgy,VanHelsing; a Universal pleaser,9,9 January 2005,"VanHelsing is a lovely, dark, atmospheric, action-packed, well written, brilliantly conceived, effects-tacular homage to Universal's classic Monsters of the 30's and the 40's.Now, this was definitely NOT high art, that's for sure. And it strayed from what I had expected, considering it was Universal. You would expect the characters to be based on the older Universal monsters; or at least...I did. The one thing which made me like this work so much was the treatment of the vampyres in flight. That was magnificent. I was so excited to see that on the big screen ... and I liked the treatment of Frankenstein's monster. He was much more like Shelly wrote him than Universal's first reincarnation of him. He was insightful, intelligent, and quoting Paradise Lost. He was brilliantly done. Popcorn flicks are seriously underrated, though. I love the big effects and the big, epic feeling of those blockbuster-y KABOOM pics. I'm an Eye Candy whore, yes, but that's not all I look for. I thought there WAS a nice story here. It was really rather sweet. Dracula wanted his children to live. Okay, yes, he also wanted to use them to dominate the world and destroy (or enslave) mankind, but other than that, it was quite sentimental. I was a bit disappointed, however, that we were not given the Gabriel/Abraham back-story. That is aggravating. Gabriel is called the ""right hand of God"" in the movie. Does that mean that Gabriel VanHelsing is somehow the archangel Gabriel? I dunno. It left a lot of questions for me. The homagic sequences at the beginning, those filmed in an almost film noir style in the opening, did let me know right there at the door of this thing, that Sommers had tampered with the Universal formula. But even with the changes to the feel and the base story lines, I found this endeavor highly enjoyable. They cannot explain it away by saying that THIS Frankenstein's monster was another one, and not the first, because they have Frankenstein there, screaming, ""It's alive!"" and not something else like, ""It's alive, again!"" or ""GO ME!"" Dracula clearly was not there in the original Universal installments to which this was supposed to be a continuation. However, as was pointed out by My mate, Dracula could have been there in the originals, but ""dimly present,"" or downright invisible. He IS a master Vampyre, after all. But in this version, he was neither dim, invisible, nor absent. So...that leads us back to the beginning. Sommers tampered with the formula very deeply; I feel that's why this work struck such an errant note with most viewers. It just didn't feel quite right to the purists. But for me, Van Helsing was a very different experience from that.From time to time, there comes along a cinematic work which fills you with a sense of wonder and awe. For me, Van Helsing was the first one since the LotR trilogy to touch that place in my mind's eye. For open-minded fans of the old Universal classics, the use of black and white at the beginning gave a feeling of connection with the movie from the onset. Familiar characters, familiar settings, familiar stories; all with a fresh, new spin while maintaining the old familiarities. The audience is treated to the best eye candy while making the attempt to maintain the integrity of the classics. You get to see vampyres in flight, the caring (and loving) conceptual makeup of Frankenstein's Monster, and a delightfully fresh treatment of VanHelsing combined with stellar performances, painstaking direction, and brilliant post-production work make this one of my new absolute favorites. The werewolves were quite good. Of course, this work was also a Universal production, so they were able to use the Wolf Man words, ""Even a man who is good at heart and says his prayers by night..."" We were in the theater and my love said to me (quietly of course), ""They can't use that!"" ""Ah, but they can,"" I answered. ""This is Universal, too."" ""No wonder it's so good,"" was my love's only response.I really enjoyed the dialog. It was cleverly witty and delightfully fresh. As was the take on the whole enterprise. It was beautiful and dark, yet full of hope. I thoroughly enjoyed this attempt and hope they are amply successful with this work to warrant a sequel.On a final note: while I thoroughly enjoyed the theatrical DVD release (""making of"" featurette, director's commentary and tons of extras for a theatrical version), I strongly suggest you get the Ultimate Edition available at amazon.com.It rates just beneath Underworld at a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Van Helsing

Nearly every conceivable horror creature created for the silver screen is resurrected for this masterpiece. Mary Shelley's Frankenstine born in 1818, Bram Stoker's Dracula penned in 1897, the fable Lycanthrope, Wolfman and even Robert Louis Stevenson's duel identities of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde are part of this magnificent and horrifying menagerie. The story also includes Dracula's Black Transylvanian castle, the pathetic hunchback assistant Igor and an army of throat-ripping, flying children of the night. But just to round-out the story the famed vampire hunter Gabriel Van Helsing takes center stage to this nightmarish saga. The film is called "" Van Helsing "" and is a living tribute to all the horror stories of the 1930's 40 and 50's. What this movie offers is a collection of those dark tales and nightmares we thought we'd forgotten in our youth. Not so, with the incredible special effects this film uses, those black dreams return and are more terrifying than ever. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, with Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula. Kevin J. O'Connor is Igor and surprisingly Alun Armstrong plays Cardinal Jinette. Samuel West is Dr. Victor Frankenstein with Robbie Coltrane and Stephen Fisher both playing Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde. For those seeking eye candy there is Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran as Marishka. From start to finish, there is so much action, drama and savage physical confrontation it's nearly impossible to turn away. What puzzles me is the main characters' constantly fall from dizzying heights to crash against everything from thick wooden beams to concrete and stone barriers of all kinds and yet few bones are ever broken.

76,dee.reid,"""Van Helsing""",7,24 October 2004,"""Van Helsing"" is a movie that boasts some incredible special effects, but suffers a lot from awfully strenuous pacing that mars what is an otherwise fun experience.Out on home video just in time for the Halloween season, the famous (or should I say infamous?) vampire slayer Van Helsing (Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman) is the most wanted man in Europe, for accusations that he is a murderer rather than a hero. His quarry has expanded from vampires to any number of ghoulish nasties, including Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.Aided by the bumbling friar Carl (David Wenham) and with the help of the Transylvanian beauty Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), he proceeds to track down his arch-nemesis Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), who has recruited the Wolf Man and seeks to use Frankenstein - both in some notorious plot.From the opening credits, which homages to the Universal monster classics of yore, ""Van Helsing"" sucks you in. Certainly more comic book than fright film, it's still impressive entertainment. It has a fairly slow build-up, but gets interesting once the special effects kick in.Unfortunately, while the special effects are the best part of ""Van Helsing,"" they quickly become ""Van Helsing,"" abandoning any plot elements and reducing the characters to special effects as well.Aside from that minor quibble, ""Van Helsing"" is still a fun and fast ride from Stephen Sommers, the director of the first two ""Mummy"" films and the 1998 horror movie ""Deep Rising.""7/10",Van Helsing

Universal must have decided to give Sommers the green light to handle ALL of the Universal monsters, and rather than doing it in several films, he wraps them all up in one great, complete package.Sure these Universal stories could have been made each into singular films of their own, but only Sommers could have brought Van Helsing face to face with The Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, and even Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde.People expecting something else, totally forgot who directed this piece: Stephen Sommers, whose earlier treatment of The Mummy blew our minds- WHAT did they expect? Of course Sommers had to reach for the sky. It is not this film that was done badly, it was the public reaction to it, and if you reach back, Bush had just won a second term, so the public was in no good mood- Whereas the first Mummy was released during the height of an economy boom, and the second, just before housing balloon popped, in 2004, it was simply not the right time to release a film as light as this.This film is not just over the top, it is WAY over the top... And because of that it is rather funny, perhaps there was too much humour in the film, The Mummies had several serious moments, this had few. I believe that because this film was dine as a period piece, people expected Sommers to stay within the realm of the technologies we knew existed in those times... But Sommers instead, transposed several modern ideas into the story, and uses them... Maybe people thought this was too unbelievable... But I think Sommer's idea was, since this was a secret society of evil vanquishers sponsored by the highly secretive Vatican, Van Helsing had access to things like Rapid Fire Arrows and the little ""Volcano in a Bottle"" gag. Since the Vatican are huge secret-hoarders, it is not too much of a limb to make yourself believe that Van Jackman had access to these things.Jackman is what makes the film so enjoyable, Between Jackman and David Wenham, they had me in stitches for most of the film. Kate Beckinsale is absolutely beautiful, I have not seen her in any films for some time, but she is absolutely fabulous in this. And of course we have ""Benny"" from The Mummy, Kevin O'Conner, as Igor, and a great face, Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's Monster.The first time I saw this was mid 2005, now six years later, I can laugh at it, and enjoy it like Sommers wanted us all to do in the first place. Since this film, Sommers has produced a 3rd Mummy film, directed by Rob Cohen, but even with a different director, that film is flush with Sommer style gags.If anything, this film was too ambitious, but even so, I hated it, but now I like it a lot.",Van Helsing
78,CubsandCulture,Time has been kind to the film,8,24 May 2019,"When I saw this in the theater back in 2004 it struck me as a singularly awful cinematic experience. The story was filled with far too many plotlines and a jumbled mess of characters. The film's visuals were overwrought and filled with some shockingly bad CGI work. The acting was pitched, hammy and annoying. The film made weird allusions to the bible and the references to the Universal Horror films of the 30's and 40's felt more forced than loving. Simply put I hated the film.Anyway, I re-watched the film the other day for the first time in *years.* A lot of that is still true. No one will confuse this film for great cinema. It isn't even, necessarily, great popcorn fun. But time has really helped the film a lot. The CGI looks, technically, far worse today than it did in 2004; given the sheer amount of CGI present the film ends up with theatrical aura of artifice. This works to the film's advantage as it shifts the tone into camp. This immediately makes a lot of the overstuffed story and pitched acting *enjoyable* as loving cheesy homage to the original set of Universal films. Moreover, the fake looking CGI feels appropriately dated the way the black and white and pseudo-German expressionism feels dated in, for example, Frankenstein (1931). Time has made the film feel far more like an extension of, say, The House of Frankenstein than a cynical cash grab banking on the success of the Mummy movies.The opening sequence still stands out as the best in the film. It is *exactly* what a homage to the big 3 monsters should be. I am glad that Summers had the wisdom (or backbone) to at least film that in black and white. (The film would be far better if it embraced being camp). If only the rest of the film was as well thought out I wouldn't had to wait 15 years to get a fairly fun movie.",Van Helsing
79,MaxBorg89,Occasionally good horror homage,6,29 September 2005,"The idea of making a homage to the classic Universal horror films of the '30s wasn't bad.Unfortunately,the result is hardly a masterpiece.The movie is about Gabriel Van Helsing,a monster slayer who works for the Vatican(John Carpenter's Vampires,anyone?)and is sent to Transylvania to kill Count Dracula(Richard Roxburg)with the help of his assistant Carl(David Wenham)and local beauty Anna Valerious(Kate Beckinsale).The script is interesting,but looks most like an excuse to put Frankenstein's Monster(Shuler Hensley)and the Wolfman(Will Kemp)in the movie,and this is proved by their limited screen time.But what are we supposed to expect,since Van Helsing is Dracula's nemesis? As for the acting,Kate Beckinsale has done much better films;Jakcman isn't that bad,but his character lacks something of what made Wolverine so loved by everyone;Roxburg's Dracula is amusing,although it seems he's parodying Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee.The only actors really worth watching between the endless CG battles are Hensley,Wenham and Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor.Partially enjoyable,it's good if you want to spend two hours watching a 100% blockbuster whose only goal is to entertain you without providing any emotion.",Van Helsing

The length of the movie is also a problem as it looks that the movie is been stretched unnecessarily.Acting is decent and Hugh Jackman had done a fantastic job, Richard Roxburgh was equally impressive, Kate Beckinsale and David Wenham were average but effective.Screenplay of the movie is average and as mentioned the movie looks stretched. The movie could've been great with an effective and crisper screenplay. There comes a point where the movie starts loosing it's grip on the viewers and couldn't get connected with the viewers easily. The climax of the movie is also average and doesn't interests much.This is a above average action horror movie which could've been little more good with some decent execution.

82,noralee,Good Looking But Tired Retread of Monster Legends,4,19 December 2005,"""Van Helsing"" has excellent production design, music, sound editing, and special effects that should rattle the pre-teens it is aimed at and would probably have given me nightmares at that age but these days it's just rated PG-13.Both Kate Beckinsale and Hugh Jackman manage to do blue-screen acting within clunky costumes, but it's Richard Roxburgh's Count Dracula who really stands out as sexily sinister. One could certainly imagine his prolific fertility with his three model-pretty brides. Australia just keeps putting out these hunks who can do any accent.The sidekick is the silliest yet for such movies; even the ones in ""Lara Croft"" are more interesting.What a shame that Stephen Sommers wrote and directed as I just kept thinking what Joss Whedon would have done with the material instead of this literal and visual recycling of the old Frankenstein and Wolfman movies, etc., that were tired by the time Abbott and Costello satirized them.What was that about Van Helsing having been at Masada? That must have been in the days when his name was Abraham, before this movie for no particular reason changed it to Gabriel. (originally written 5/28/2004)",Van Helsing
83,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Just can't help but love this one:),8,24 March 2016,"I've got a soft spot for Stephen Sommer's Van Helsing. Yeah its basically a theme park ride put on film, and Hugh Jackman is about as appropriate and qualified for the role as a stick, but there's something shamelessly fun about the way it sheepishly tosses just about every golden age monster movie character it can think of into the mix, resulting in quite the chaotic two hours of CGI, perplexing plotting and trannsylvanian accents worthy of Count Chocula. It's so ambitious it even throws in an extended Alien reference near the end, and one has to admire that. Jackman plays a youthful, athletic version of the crusty old vampire hunter, introduced to us in a London opener in which he's pursuing a rambunctious Dr. Jekyll/M. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane). Soon he's whisked off to darkest eastern Europe with his monk sidekick """" (David Wenham is a hoot) to investigate vamps, werewolves, monsters and all kinds of ooey gooey stuff. There he meets Anna (Kate Beckinsale), the shapely leader of a clan of monster hunters, whose brother is the leader of a pack of werewolves causing trouble in the area. This all leads to eventual confrontations with Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) and Dracula himself played with hammy rock star glory by Richard Roxburgh. It's all topsy turvy stuff and Director Sommers clearly struggles with making it a cohesive result, but where he falters he makes up for it by making it knowingly schlocky fun with just enough camp to elicit a twinge of nostalgia for the monster flicks of yore.",Van Helsing
84,davispittman,Very fun!,7,18 November 2016,"Van Helsing (2004) is fun and pretty well made in different aspects. It has good acting throughout by all the actors, especially by Beckinsale and Jackman. Kate Beckinsale really is a great choice for the role she fulfills, she has the correct physical look/appearance, and she fits in all the other ways as well, good cast call. Hugh Jackman is obviously playing the main character here, Van helsing. Hugh also gives a fine performance, and he also physically fits the role, he's very stoic at times but then heartfelt at times when he needs to be, and he's strong/muscular, which of course is necessary with all the action scenes and maneuvers he must perform. Speaking of action scenes, the special effects and the actual fighting in this movie is all very well done, and I don't mean to say that it's the best thing in any action movie you'll see, but it suffices. I also really like the way they did Dracula's wives, seductive and menacing at the same time, which of course is the way Dracula's wives are supposed to be. I thought the plot was entertaining and I thought it was executed well. So all in all Van Helsing receives a seven out of 10 as far as quality goes.",Van Helsing
85,hu675,"An goofy, adventure, horror/thriller with an nice sense of humour.",8,8 September 2007,"Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is an infamous monster hunter, Who works for the Vatican. Helsing and his sidekick Karl (David Wenham) are sent to Transylvania on a mission to destroy Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and his three brides (Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran). But Count Dracula isn't working alone, since he has the Wolf Man (Will Kemp) on his side and his loyal assistant Igor (Kevin J.

Which Anna tries to save her brother, which her brother has become an Wolf Man. Van Helsing and his sidekick finds themselves in the most difficult mission of their career. Especially they are the only ones, who could destroy Count Dracula and his three evil brides with the help of Anna.Written and Directed by Stephen Sommers (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Deep Rising) made an enjoyable if especially dumb action-packed ride. Jackson is solid as usual as the title lead character in the film. This movie has good supporting performances and some fine visual effects. Although Sommers' script is some ways could have been much more and less jokey in tone. Which it worked much better in his previous pictures. The movie's best moments are in the first half of the movie. It does offers something different in some key sequences. It will also probably disappointed some of the die-hard fans of the Universal's monster films. But this movie is aimed more at kids and fans of Sommers' movies than the general audiences.DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two enjoyable commentaries tracks. One is by the writer/producer/director:Sommers and editor/producer:Bob Ducsay. Second commentary is by the actors:Roxburgh, Kemp and Hensley. DVD also has featurettes, Outtakes and more. But the best thing about ""Van Helsing"" is the funny, campy performance of Roxburgh is certainly an Hoot as Count Dracula. The actresses, who plays his three brides have their moments as well. Beckinsale is somewhat in familiar territory after seeing her in the ""Underworld"" movies. Sommers' movies is always been style over substance with heavy CGI effects, good looking cinematography and strong music score are always important in his films. Probably the most memorable thing in the movie as well is in the Black & White opening sequence is terrific as well. I thought ""Van Helsing"" would have looked great if the whole movie stayed in Black & White. Since this film was even an bigger hit on DVD than it was in theaters. Fred Dekker's ""The Monster Squad"" was done much better and it was ahead of it's time as well. Overall ""Van Helsing"" is entertaining, Sommers' best film is still ""The Mummy"" and he should lay off the monsters movies for a while. (*** ½/*****).",Van Helsing
86,Enchorde,Tries to do too much...,6,23 August 2004,"** HERE BE SPOILERS **Van Helsing, this is the story of a man fighting evil monsters around the world. A man that doesn't remember his past well (oh he remember that he is at least 1800 years old), a servant of the catholic church secret agency, is sent to Transylvania to aid and save a noble family's Valerious) right to enter heaven and kill the evil Dracula. Because an ancestor to the family has sworn no member of the family will enter heaven until Dracula is vanquished. Now only two siblings of the family remain, and the church don't want to fail this ally. Van Helsing arrives in Transylvania to find Draculas minions attacking the villagers and hunting the Valerious heirs.So this is an homage to the monster movies of the old. Unfortunately this is not a very good movie. I think this movie tries to do so much that it fails it all. First and foremost, the central plot is not coherent. Well it is perfectly understandable why the Valerious hunt Dracula, but Dracula has no apparent reason to specifically hunt the Valerious. Sure, they might have been a bit annoying but no prophecy or anything will be fulfilled for Dracula by doing this. Furthermore the plot is extremely shallow. Now, this might be acceptable in an action movie that don't aspire to be more, but this movie keep hinting of a historical vendetta or some sort of coupling between Dracula and Van Helsing. This I find to be very interesting, and to find out the entire story is one of the main reasons to keep watching. Well, the main history, even if the movie tries in vain to keep it a secret, is ridiculously easy to figure out almost at the beginning. The disappointment comes when the movie tries to reveal this exciting piece of information and it is nothing more than what anyone that is barely conscious already knows. I think that you'll unfortunately discover this as well if you ever watch the movie.Other things that annoyed me was why did Van Helsing use an automatic X-bow, when he can use shotguns, guns or Gatling guns, surely Q, oh did I say Q, I meant Carl, can and did give him some of those. Furthermore the movie confuses how to vanquish vampires and werewolves. As I understand it, werewolves can't stand silver and vampires kind of dislike wooden stakes through their hearts. Why Van Helsing has a silver stake is kind of questionable, to me at least. Additionally for me a totally new aspect of vampires was introduced. They lay eggs. I always thought that new vampires came from people being bitten by other vampires. Oh, finally concerning the story, the addition of Hyde and Franskenstein into the movie is completely unnecessary. They bring nothing to the story and could, should, have been completely cut. Must be that homage-thing.The acting and editing is not awful but not very good either. I don't know if this is due to lack of interest from the actors or due to inferior material to work with. There are a lot of over-acting, especially Dracula has a long, completely pointless scene, where his over-acting his horrific.What is good about the movie then. Four things come to mind. The scenery, with the village and woods, is nice. I did find the music good and the special effects in themselves is very good and finally the action parts is entertaining. But when other parts fail, this doesn't help much.4/10",Van Helsing
87,questl-18592,Ban Helsing,3,18 October 2020,"Bad acting, bad story, awful, awful CGI. The only thing that redeemed this movie at all is that it kinda falls into the ""so bad it's good"" category.If you can laugh at how awful this is then there might be some enjoyment but that doesn't absolve out of its shortcomings.

88,adamjohns-42575,Ghoulies,7,3 August 2021,"It starts off at the end of the 19th century and there's a reference to Wellington at Waterloo, but it feels like it comes from a much older period. Apart from that it's a really enjoyable film. It incorporates all of the ghouls and monsters of traditional Hammer Horror in a tongue in cheek 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' way.The cast are very good. David Wenham is a very underrated and diverse actor and he really proves that here. I was also quite surprised by the fantastic performance by Richard Roxborough as Dracula. Hugh is as always superb and so God damned handsome.It's corny and cheesey, but done in a comic book style that makes it easily accessible and in some ways suitable for kids. There is after all a lot of culture here as well as the horror elements, besides a few nightmares will build character.The CGI is a few levels above 'Neville Longbottom on the broom' but still not what we are now used to in these more recent years.It's a shame that they canned the idea of making sequels as I really think that it had legs.

89,truemythmedia,Bleghhh...,3,21 June 2019,"Hugh Jackman spends his time running around, dodging sword slashes and vampire bites in slow motion, jumping over broken bridges and jumping from death-defying heights with his trench cloak rippling in the wind behind him. They turned Van Helsing into a character that fights like Neo from ""The Matrix"", but has no personality whatsoever. They reduce great literary villains and characters to poorly choreographed fifteen-minute action set pieces that take place in horribly busy, overcrowded frames. The characters never do anything remarkably interesting as far as how they fight either. Van Helsing is pretty much the Vatican's monster hunter version of James Bond; he's got ridiculous gadgets and weapons, but he never does anything cool with them. Instead, Jackman hits a monster and the monster hits back, over and over again until one of them dies. There's no tension, there are rarely any stakes established- the dialogue in between the action scene is heavily expositional and often incredibly stilted. Every scene just feels like an excuse to move us to the next action sequence; there's no thought into why things look the way they do, other than if something looks cool.

91,davidmvining,A Guilty Pleasure,5,7 July 2020,"This is not what I would call a good movie. It's characters are too thin, the romance too contrived, the structure too loose, and the theme too scattershot, but what it lacks in some of the basic building blocks of storytelling it partially makes up for in charm and a deep seeded desire to entertain no matter what. Those two aspects make Stephen Sommers' Van Helsing something of a guilty pleasure for me. No, it's not good, but I enjoy it every time I watch it.Delving into the story is an exercise not really worth the effort because it's too manically told with the passion of an adolescent hopped upon Red Bull and Mountain Dew, throwing his toys together with a shocking amount of energy at two in the morning. Essentially, Gabriel (not Abraham) Van Helsing is a monster hunter working for Rome, and he carries the burden of being called a murderer because everyone sees the results of his work but not the efforts. It's a question that the movie brings up from time to time but has little to not ability to expand upon beyond the initial ask. It's not concerned with Van Helsing as a man but as a vehicle through which to drive the audience through the plot and hang a couple of mysterious questions about his past that area supposed to add to the overall mystery.He gets sent to Transylvania along with Carl, a friar who ends up acting as Q to the James Bond that is Van Helsing, supplying him with weapons along the way. Carl is one of the biggest sources of fun in the film. He's the fish out of water, not a field man, and he's played really wittily by David Wenham. When he doesn't seem to be having a blast, he's amusingly out of his element with a creaky voice that barley conceals pure terror.In Transylvania, Van Helsing meets up with Anna Valerious, a Romanian princess descended from a long line of hunters out to kill Dracula. Her brother gets turned into a werewolf and she helps Van Helsing fight off an attack of three flying Brides of Dracula. The basic plot is that Dracula is trying to use the technology that brought Frankenstein's monster to life in order to bring his large cadre of dead-born children to life. There are chases, fights, explosions, and all manner of chaos.The movie's best sequence comes late at a masquerade ball where Dracula has captured Anna and is trying to trade her for Frankenstein's monster that Van Helsing has found. It's a visual delight with acrobatics, dancing, singing, and special effects. The movie's ultimate climax in Dracula's castle makes the mistake of having both the hero and the villain transform into CGI monsters, robbing the audience of investment in the conflict by hiding the faces of those we've spent time with, but since there's no real investment to be had, it's not as bad as it could have been.Really, it's not good. I went back and found Roger Ebert's three star review of the film, and I agree with everything he said. However, I just can't quite say that even though I have a good time with the film that it's actually good. That's all I need, right? To have a good time? Well, it's thin entertainment that doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, the sort of thing I couldn't watch too frequently because the sloppy construction would get to me.It's a guilty pleasure, and I have no real problem admitting that.",Van Helsing

93,onepotato2,a seriously dopey movie,1,10 March 2005,"Taking a very, very dumb page from Sleepy Hollow (in which a famous textual schoolteacher was somehow changed into a cop), van Helsing the occasional vampire killer is now the full-time enforcement arm of the living against all things dead and evil, James Bond c.1889 if you will... If you stir in some of the moribund over-dramatics of Interview with a Vampire you get this frantic, loud, stupid movie.Things are off to bad start with two unnecessary introductory sequences which eat up twenty minutes at the beginning that serve no purpose except to confirm for viewers that, yes this is the dumb fx movie you have been waiting for. The second of the two involves an absurd Shrek-like Mr Hyde. whom would scarcely fit into Edwardian London as a ten foot tall giant with acromegaly. If a sequel is made, presumably van Helsing will kill a nine-foot tall Lizzie Borden or Jack the Ripper with 4 arms.The plot is one long bad joke. The beautiful princess Dexatrim (Kate Beckinsale) gets her brother killed and mayhem follows with all the Universal monsters except the Mummy. The euro-trash Dracula is grating and unsexy in everyway. He looks like a slightly uglier, more feminine k.d. Lang and unless you're a goth-nerd, his ponytail is about fifteen years late to offer even an ounce of hipness. The Frankenstein monster is excruciating. It's like he reimagined as a nerd/accountant. The ""romance-novel"" grade script requires that all the men have long hair. This is best suited for sugar-impelled viewers for whom the current scene needs to be an overstimulating distraction because the last twenty weren't enough.The last time this extravaganza was filmed it was called Hudson Hawk. This time it's more excessive. It's too long, too boring, too annoying, way too stupid and simply not enough fun. I know it's just escapism, but I have no need for any movie that makes my brain hurt as much as this.Note: This decades film-work is being marred (and will be recalled historically as marred) by the tendency of fx film directors to ruin movies by shooting even simple no-fx-required shots with green-screen, because it's cheaper, easier, and they're lazy. Another film revolution will occur when Hollywood realizes when filming a simple shot of a guy with a torch in a field looks really amazing when you just shoot the damn guy in a field.If you want to smirk while watching a piece of silly, campy crap, rent the grade-Z movie Frankenstein Unbound. ""Camp"" is when you have ten thousand bucks to make a movie and you let the movie have some fun by acknowleging that. It isn't spending millions on a loud, stupid movie because you lack taste. This movie is an exhausting drag.",Van Helsing
94,aimless-46,"An Updated ""Fearless Vampire Killers""",7,26 March 2005,"Of great entertainment value are the ""Van Helsing"" comments and message board postings from people who apparently just don't get it. Parody/satire of horror films has a long tradition and ranges from the obvious (see Abbott & Costello, Mel Brooks, and ""Redneck Zombies"") to the subtle (see ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"" and ""Evil Dead""). Before reading many of the comments I would have grouped ""Van Helsing"" closer to the obvious, after all the film depicts a Vatican Department modeled on James Bond's Special Weapons ""Q"" Section. But apparently even something so obvious is not registering with many people, if the true measure of a 'subtle' satire is how many people just don't get it, then ""Van Helsing"" certainly qualifies.They went into this project saying something like: ""let's use digital effects and a large budget to create the most interesting sets in horror movie history, and then use these as a backdrop for a parody of the ""horror genre"". When concerns were raised about the expense for just a comedy, they pitched it as a sophisticated parody that would not get in the way of the average viewer's desire to see a traditional vampire movie. Such a dichotomy allows the movie to generate big bucks at the box office while still providing its makers with an outlet for their creativity. But such a dichotomy means there will be a third group of viewers who cannot suspend belief enough to enjoy it as a horror film and yet will totally miss the parody angle (the only question is whether they too humorless to find enjoyment in such frivolity or are just a little too dim to appreciate it). We see a lot of negative comments from this third group but 'f them if they can take a joke'-or don't get a joke.The movie opens with a visually awesome scene of the villagers storming a huge castle and burning a windmill; the sets and the music are great. Except for the overacting and the presence of an assistant named 'Egor' or ""Igor"" (see Mel Brooks reference), you would not suspect that this is anything but a serious horror film. Actually at first I thought it might be a high budget commercial and kept thinking Dracula would say he had gotten a great deal on his car insurance. Although this was the best scene in the movie there were several almost as good and each one had a similar restrained level of satire.The film plays homage to the Karloff/Chaney films, to Abbott and Costello, Mel Brooks, James Bond and The Wild, Wild West. There is a little Phantom of the Opera and even Eli Wallach's best line from 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' (if you're going to shoot, shoot don't talk). In fact they even lift the vampire ballroom scene from ""The Fearless Vampire Killers"".The individual performances are from the William Shatner School of Over-Acting with Dracula's brides totally stealing each scene in which they are featured. I particularly liked Josie Maran (who had that great scene as the cigarette girl in ""The Aviator"") as Marishka. The costumes are almost as good as the sets. The computer-generated action sequences illustrate all the problems with digital effects, but work fine as satirical devices.So if you want to see a fun film with unparalleled visuals this is the one. Others who can suspend belief and ignore a few campy elements will enjoy it as a straight vampire picture. But if you are can't suspend belief, are humorless, or don't know the horror genre you should stay away. Because there are really two movies here, the first viewing withholds most of the viewing pleasure; once you understand what is happening repeated viewings are even more fun.",Van Helsing
95,rosscinema,"Outlandish, to say the least",4,16 May 2004,"I grew up watching the Universal horror films and when I heard that they were making this I had the suspicion that I was going to be disappointed. I guess I'm from the old school where I prefer original make-up over CGI effects and many times during my viewing of this I thought I was watching a Warner Bros. cartoon. Story is about monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who works for the Vatican and he is told that Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) is in Transylvania causing trouble but first though he goes to the Notre Dame cathedral and kills Mr. Hyde. Van Helsing takes an inventive Friar named Carl (David Wenham) along with him and when they arrive in Transylvania they are almost attacked by the local villagers but some flying vampiresses swoop down and he manages to kill one. He meets Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) who has been fighting Dracula and his brides as well and later Van Helsing learns that her brother Velkan (Will Kemp) is actually the Wolf Man. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Dracula has been searching for Frankenstein's Monster (Shuler Hensley) so that he can learn the secrets of creation and bring his own offspring to life. Along with the Wolf Man and his brides Dracula has Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) to help him and after Van Helsing and Anna find The Monster they set out to get him. Van Helsing gets bit by the Wolf Man and in two days the moon will be full so now they must hurry to stop Dracula's plans.This film is directed by Stephen Sommers who did the ""Mummy"" films and while he genuinely brings tons of energy to his films there are just too many CGI effects for my taste. The whole film is so cartoonish and silly that it goes way over the top and there isn't a scary moment in the film. Jackman looks like he rummage through the wardrobe department from ""Indiana Jones"" and found the right getup to wear and Beckinsale looks like a Victoria Secret model with her corset. Also, Beckinsale demonstrates so many flips that she would be a cinch to win a gold medal at the Olympics. Wenham as Carl is the comic relief and he has the best lines in the film like after the Wolf Man jumps out of a window he asks ""Why does it smell like wet dog""? And why do the werewolves in this film have the ability to crawl up walls like a lizard and be able to jump like a grasshopper? Dracula wants to bring his offspring to life but they are in cocoons. Why are they in cocoons and how does the living dead mate? Roxburgh as Dracula is especially hammy and along with Beckinsale you have to chuckle at the attempts at a Romanian accent. The part of the film about the Monster I found a little more interesting but he's so chatty! Frankenstein's Monster speaks better than most people today and he seems equipped to be an English teacher. The last 20 minutes of this film is so silly and drenched in CGI effects that it ceases to be a film and instead is more animated. The Monster and Beckinsale spend most of the last 20 minutes swinging on cables like Spiderman and Beckinsale's character is thrown and tossed like a rag doll and there is no way she could keep getting up. As old as the original films are they still have more impressive special effects and are genuinely scarier but if someone told me they liked this as just escapism and entertainment I wouldn't argue. But for me it's just utter nonsense and completely outlandish and over the top and I still recommend the old Universal horror films over this.",Van Helsing
96,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Just too much happening here,5,15 January 2016,"Hugh Jackman has had his fair share of films people always enjoy. The Prestige (2006) and Prisoners (2013) are of a couple that Jackman is well respected for. With this, Jackman has had a steady career of being cast in various films. By far the one everyone will remember him for though is his portrayal of Logan AKA Wolverine from X-Men (2000) and the numerous sequels and spin-offs that came after. There have only been a handful of features that Jackman probably thinks people shouldn't bother seeing. By now one of his highest choices would probably be Movie 43 (2013), which received extremely negative reviews. Before this though, Jackman was in another film that isn't exactly high end either. For that case it belongs to this film, an action fantasy movie that is cluttered with several things that make it a bore to sit through. It isn't the absolute worst but it gets very tiresome over time. There just needed to be less of what was present and perhaps it might've felt smoother.Picking up where the animated prequel left off after chasing Mr. Hyde, Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is assigned to go after Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) who's after an ancient family bloodline lead by Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). Turns out Drac wants the secret of life created in Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley). After the financial success of The Mummy Returns (2001), Stephen Sommers came back for this project as the writer/director. This is probably where most of the problem lies. After the waves he made with his mummy franchise, Sommers just went on auto pilot, making action fantasy spectacles that became less and less engaging. Looking back I know my review to G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (2009) needs a re-adjustment because after watching this, the same tropes are fairly much the same in there too. All the plots to the writing (whether main or sub) contain numerous genre clichés that are tired and simply uninteresting.Before the leads even physically meet it is foreshadowed that Van Helsing will fall for Anna. That's no spoiler, it's plainly obvious. Even the plot itself is overused. Why must every movie that involves Frankenstein's monster have it be ""the key"" to whatever the villain is planning? There's also unexplained mythology about several parts to the plot. Dracula's weakness and Van Helsing's backstory largely are just hinted at. Other than that there's no in-depth look; so why even bother? Another problem is pacing. This movie is over 2 hours long and felt painfully slow, as if there wasn't even a script to begin with. Plus, the plot dealing with Frankenstein's monster isn't introduced until around the halfway point. I, Frankenstein (2014) had the same overall plot, was a half an hour shorter and managed to make the viewing experience feel somewhat more enjoyable because of its trimmed running time. Here it just feels like a slow treck through action scene after action scene.The last issue to this creature feature is the cast. Jackman and Beckinsale are probably the only two who play it straight. Jackman was the better half more because he has better quips for certain situations. Other than these two people, every other actor is hammy beyond belief. It's one thing if a single actor hams it up more than everyone else, but when the whole cast is being over the top, it just feels overly dramatic and in the most silliest of ways. Carl (David Wenham), Van Helsing's assistant is nothing more than a sidekick. Will Kemp is useless as Anna's brother. Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor (who looks like he has John Hurt's makeup from The Elephant Man (1980)) is wasted because it's shown he has opinions,...but that's ignored. Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's monster is cool looking but does a lot of screaming. The same goes for Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. He by far chews the most scenery; MORE than Richard Grant from Rocky V (1990). It's ridiculous.These are the positives to the film and they do make the viewing better but still not decent enough. Robbe Coltrane voicing Mr. Hyde was nice hearing again. The action, although too abundant, was mostly entertaining. Even though by today's standards compared to 2004, even the CGI looked fairly good. This goes for the action sequences or the slower moving shots. The cinematography shot by Allen Daviau looks adequate too. Daviau was also the DP for E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983) and Empire of the Sun (1987). Composing the film score to this action fantasy movie was Alan Silvestri. Turns out for this score, Silvestri does not stick to his usual sound. Here he incorporates some synth into his motifs. He also arranged multiple themes for various characters and scene locations. Now if only his full score would be released, that'd be nice. If you can ignore all the bad things mentioned before you might enjoy this movie.Action junkies and Hugh Jackman fans would probably get the most benefit from this film. It isn't terrible but it has enough issues, with its painful pacing, overzealous actors and foggy writing. The action, music and visuals are good but that's what most Stephen Sommers' films have in them. It's rather boring at times.",Van Helsing
97,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Van B@rfbag,1,14 October 2020,"Can't imagine anyone older than the video-game generation enjoying this furiously loud mess.It's basically a Greatest Hits of Monsters. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. Like a K-Tel record from the 70s.There isn't a single human-scale scene in the entire movie. I felt bad for Richard Roxburgh, whose Hollywood agent seems to have got him cast in some of the all-time stinkeroos. No wonder he went back to Australia.I feel less bad for Hugh Jackman, who can't act to save his life. Same with Kate Beckinsale. How either of them manage to remain employed is a mystery to me.I enjoyed the way Frankensteain's monster walked like he'd p00ped his pants, though. That was a nice touch.",Van Helsing
98,lemon_magic,It's not so much that it's a bad movie...there's just too bloody much of it.,6,1 February 2006,"I looked up the entry for ""Too much of a good thing"" in Wikipedia, and there was a promotional poster for ""Van Helsing"" in the second tag.OK, not really. But after seeing the hammering this movie took from the critics, I had to ""see this marvel with mine own eyes!"" (to quote Earthworm Jim) in order to see what could spark such enmity. And after sitting through 2 1/2 hours or more of roller-coaster plotting, thundering sound design, apocalyptic orchestral riffs and zillions of dollars worth of special effects and CGI, I had to say...that it's not so much that the movie is bad, as that exhausts the viewers' patience after an hour or so.The best metaphor I can come up with is to compare the movie to eating 3 boxes of ""Captain Crunch"" at one sitting. Now, ""Captain Crunch"" was one of my favorite breakfast cereals as a callow youth, and in fact I still like it immensely as an occasional treat. It is the very essence of the ""frosted sugar bomb"" that kids love. And ""Van Helsing"" is both vivid and crisp and shallow and delicious and cloying the way that a good 99% sugar breakfast food should be. But ""Captain Crunch"" gets old fast if you have to eat it past your normal satiation point...and so does ""Van Helsing."" I loved the costumes and the character designs, and I thought the cast did a great job with the overwrought, overheated, overstuffed screenplay and I thought that maybe 70% of the CGI effects were reasonably convincing, and there were some very nice touches here and there that added a lot of punch to the movie (Sommers has been good at this kind of stuff ever since his remake of ""The Mummy"")...but after about 90 minutes, I just wanted it to be over, while the movie still had an hour to go.The solution, of course, is to stop the DVD player every 30 minutes or so and get up, walk around, run an errand or two, then get back to the movie after 5-10 minutes and have at it again. THEN ""Van Helsing"" becomes something you can enjoy. (This is similar to my experience with the first ""Star Trek"" movie and ""Barry Lyndon"" and ""Altered States"".) So yes, if you are a big fan of the old Universal monsters and you have some patience and you enjoy an approach that throws EVERYTHING Sommers can think of into the mix with a plot that jumps around like a bag full of angry ferrets, you'll probably get a bang out of ""Van Helsing"". Otherwise, just avoid it...it will probably irritate and exasperate you.",Van Helsing
99,Rob_Taylor,Van Helstink,7,16 May 2004,"Let me start this review by saying that I was predisposed to like this movie right from the start. I like horror movies and the meeting of three great movie legends - Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein's Monster - seemed to me to be an interesting and entertaining combination. Plus, the movie was by Stephen Sommers, director of The Mummy, which is one of my favourites. Then there was the cast - Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and David Wenham. All these factors combined to bring a great sense of anticipation in me that this would be a great movie.Sadly, I was disappointed.It's not bad, by any means, but the things which make a movie great just aren't there. In trying to understand why this film didn't do anything for me, I can point to several factors, one of which, ironically, is one of the reasons I thought I would enjoy the film - the meeting of three screen legends. But let's go through it point by point.Firstly there's Richard Roxborough. Now, he looks like a good Dracula, I'll give him that, but unfortunately, from the moment he opened his mouth to deliver his characters first line, I found myself struggling not to laugh. His accent isn't terrible, but it's just the wrong side of a Realistic/Carry On movie accent to be anything but humorous. Any menace his character had was ruined by that.Secondly, there's altogether too much swinging from ropes, cables and chains in this film. It's entirely pointless, for the most part, and speaks of a lack of imagination when writing the scenes. The opening scene at Notre Dame cathedral, for instance, involves a scene with ropes. There's countless others throughout the film until you're left with the feeling that you're watching a Tarzan movie.Thirdly, and perhaps the most annoying. The CGI. It's just plain cack. None of the creatures look particularly realistic, in fact, they look like exactly what they are....CGI. Now, you'd think that a director whose movie The Mummy Returns was so slammed for the awful CGI Scorpion King at the end would have learnt from that mistake, but apparently not. Don't get me wrong, the CGI in VH is not anywhere near as bad as in TMR. But at no point in any of the scenes involving living (or unliving) entities do you not know that they are CGI. Although not awful, at some points it does begin to make you sigh sadly. Likewise the cuts between real actors and CGI are not done as well as might be expected. And what was the deal with the CGI Dracula? Talk about overweight! That just looked ridiculous.Fourthly, the combo of all the legendary monsters. I had thought this would be a good thing, but in fact none of the creatures got the development they deserved, instead being relegated to ""also-ran"" status. I think if they had picked one monster and written a story around that - a la The Mummy - it would have made a better film, and provided for sequels. As it is, Stephen Sommers has shot his load by using all three staples (and never mind Dr Jekyll at the start!) and hasn't anywhere to go after this. At least, nowhere that makes any sense, anyhow.Finally, the physics. No, I'm not going to go all ""undead-can't-exist-because..."" on ya. It's just that a lot of the CGI scenes involving falling, or swinging from ropes just don't look right. The eye perceives something that doesn't gel with your experiences of reality. And, as a result, the whole scene is ruined. It seemed to me that most of the swinging arcs in the film were actually parabolas, not arcs. In fact, the whole film has a ""watching someone else play a video game"" feel.There are some bright moments to the movie, though. Well...OK. One. David Wenham gives a truly hilarious performance as Van Helsing's side-kick. Along with Kevin O'Connors Igor, these two improve the film no end. I've noticed this before in some movies - when you care about minor characters more than the main ones - it's usually an indication that the film isn't that good.In summary then, the movie fails to deliver it's promise, though I doubt that'll stop it from becoming a hit this summer. At no point do you really feel either frightened or amazed. Nor does it really make you care about any of the characters. At no point do you feel that VH will fail in his mission to destroy the Count. In short, there are no surprises, except the execrable CGI.In other words, another movie that has failed to live up to the hype surrounding it, much like Kill Bill 2, although not that awful. I can only hope The Day After Tomorrow and Troy don't go the same way. Watch it once, then forget it.",Van Helsing
100,screenman,Hammer Never Did It Like This,8,2 November 2008,"Not to be compared with the under-funded, frequently pretentious, but still enjoyable Peter Cushing sorties, 'Van Helsing' is a rip-snorting out-and-out swashbuckling, tribute to the whole Hammer horror genre.The stuffy vampire-fighter of yore has been upstaged by an Indiana Jones character. Bookish, educated, but fundamentally a man of action.And what action! The movie begins with him taking-down an extremely ogreish Quasimodo type (Mr Hyde) in a bell-tower. Later he is transferred to field-duty in vampire country, where he teams-up with a demented power-girl who has her own vengeful agenda against the powers of darkness.Dracula has got a plan so cunning it would boil Baldrick's brain. And for this he requires a werewolf and Frankenstien's monster. So; with Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde we more or less have the lot. Special-effects and CGI are absolutely mesmerising. The latter are, without any doubt, the best that I have seen, and go largely unsung in the movie as a whole. Likewise there are some wonderful set-pieces that give a whole new definition to 'gothic'. Van Helsing also has some wacky, James Bond-like gadgets such as a machine crossbow that shoots silver bolts.Camera-work is excellent. Some of what appear to be micro-camera panning sequences merge with the astonishing CGI effects more seamlessly than those of the 'Rings' trilogy. It is, as they say, a roller-coaster ride.Hugh Jackman is not a particularly commanding screen presence, but here he fills his boots at least adequately. Kate Beckinsale is likewise rather a lukewarm heroine tricked-up like an extra from the 'Rocky Horror Show'. They both have the rather blandly handsome looks of cyberspace avatars, as if they themselves were computer generated. Together they make the most of an exceedingly cheesy script.Shuker Hensley gives the Frankenstien's monster genuine humanity (no irony intended), Mr Hyde lets Robbie Coltrane join the fun, whilst all are upstaged by Richard Roxburgh as the campily expansive Dracula.This isn't serious stuff. It's not a corny morality tale. It's a joyously tongue-in-cheek romp through the whole horror genre that put wine and cheese on the tables at Hammer studios over so many years. But it's done with flair, style and just the right touches of shock and sentiment. If you can stay with the ride; for 2 hours it will absolutely enthral you.",Van Helsing
101,brando647,A Disappointing Monster Mash,5,5 June 2012,"Writer/director Stephen Sommers rides the line between popcorn fun and mindless crap, and his 2004 ""homage"" to the classic Universal monsters of early cinema leans a little too close to the later. The premise of the movie is a sound one, and an idea I wouldn't have minded seeing land in the hands of a more capable director. Instead, VAN HELSING was one of the most regrettable summer films released that year and a waste of a potentially interesting new franchise. How this movie went on the gross $300 million boggles my mind, as it's nothing but throwaway entertainment in my opinion. There is no depth, no decent characters, and I don't think it does the classic Universal monsters any sort of justice. As over-the-top as it all is, I'd consider it closer to a parody. The movie follows Gabriel Van Helsing (a relation to the original Abraham, I suppose), a monster-hunter with a mysterious past that follows orders for the Vatican in disposing of the world's most evil creatures. He is sent on a mission to Transylvania with the aid of a cowardly friar to rid the land of its vampire menace, Count Vladislaus Dracula and his three brides. The princess daughter of an ancient gypsy lineage must destroy the creature if her family is to escape an eternity in Purgatory, but Dracula has his own plans. He hopes to use the life-giving technology of Dr. Frankenstein to bring his hundreds of offspring to life andthat's it, I guess.There is a lot of wasted potential here, and it's a shame. Everything about this movie is below average, from the CG to the performances. This movie only really has one thing working in its favor: beautiful women. Unfortunately, eye candy isn't enough to build a good movie. It helps, sure, but you need more: excitement, a gripping story, strong characterssomething! Instead, VAN HELSING is forgettable at best. I watch the movie again every couple years because I see it sitting on the shelf and wonder if it's really as lame as I remember and the answer is always a resounding ""YES"". The CG effects are only slightly better than your average direct-to-cable SyFy movie. It stands out like a sore thumb and rips you out of the action, especially the cartoon vampire spawn. The dialogue in the movie is horrendous, with one of Dracula's brides (I don't remember which one, none of them were fleshed out enough to be distinguishable) even busting out with ""Too bad. So sad."" Seriously. That's the level of genius we're watching here. The story is lame and makes little to no sense. Since when do vampires procreate like living beings? And how effective is it from an evolutionary standpoint if Dracula needs Frankenstein's technology to bring them to life? Did anyone think this storyline through? The action in the movie is your usual tame PG-13 fare: bloodless violence and loads of rope-swinging. Nothing fantastic. Enough to distract you but hollow enough not to leave a lasting impression.No one in this movie seems to care. Hugh Jackman, fresh off his initial successes with the X- MEN franchise, is phoning it in. He spouts his one-liners and gives a half-hearted attempt at appearing mysterious, but you can tell he's not giving this role any effort. Kate Beckinsale is Anna, the last surviving member of the cursed gypsy family. She's hot and she's tough, and at least she seems like she's trying. The characters in the movie that get the short end of the stick in this movie are, again, the Universal monsters. Richard Roxburgh chews the scenery with over-acting that rivals Jeremy Irons in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. He is easily the worst depiction of Dracula I've ever seen, but not to be outdone as Shuler Hensley gives him a run for his money as Frankenstein's monster. I'm cool with Frankenstein's monster having the power of speech and an exceptional vocabulary (I've never read Shelley's original novel, but I believe it was an intelligent creature), but I'm not sure why he felt the need to literally yell the majority of his lines. No joke, he delivers most of his dialogue at the top of his lungs. And the Wolfman, well, he was underused as Dracula's unwilling henchman and a poorly realized CGI creation. The movie has a few redeeming qualities in its production design and the hope it inspires that it can't possibly be bad with such an awesome premise. Alas, if you're in the mood for a monster mash-up you're probably better off turning to the classics HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN or HOUSE OF Dracula.",Van Helsing
102,moviewizguy,"""You Can Only Kill it with the Silver Bullet!""",6,19 June 2006,"--I love that line from the movie, said by Kate Beckinsale. Now back to the point: This movie is about a notorious monster hunter, Van Helsing, who is sent to Transylvania to protect the two siblings Anna and Velkan Valerious before Count Dracula kills them before they do. Why? If Count Dracula kills the both of them before they do, they will condemn the whole family to eternal damnation. Van Helsing is also sent there to stop Count Dracula who is using Dr. Frankenstein's research and a werewolf to make his and his wives children born.I wouldn't call this a CGI overload. I would call this a piece of entertainment! This is a great popcorn film with many great special effects with great action sequences! The movie is entertaining to the beginning through the end, although it's over two hours long. This movie takes all of the old monster movies into one whole movie. I would compare this movie to The Brothers Grimm, which takes all of the fairy tales into one movie.The beginning of the film might be off to a great start like any other Frakenstein movie when the famous line is called out: ""It's Alive!"" The beginning is black and white, like the old movies, for about 7 minutes and it's over from there. As you can see, the monsters being featured in this film are the Wolfman, Frakenstein, and Dracula and maybe including some other tid bits. The way a human who turns into a wolf is unique. The human actually tears its own skin off revealing fur and it does the same thin when they turn back into a human.One problem in the movie is that this movie is too long. It's over two hours long but I still enjoyed it like any other popcorn movie. This is a great action adventure that will be great for all ages and I highly recommend this film. This film will make you feel like a kid again! Actually, this is my first film comment that is this long!",Van Helsing
103,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"Silly, Fun Adventure",10,26 June 2005,"Many, many people have seen ""Van Helsing"" and said it is trash, a waste of time, etc, etc. But what they don't understand is that sometimes, with so much happening in the world, people need to let it all go so they can get some thrills from movies.The plot of Van Helsing is somewhere between simple and complex. The back story is that Count Dracula and his three brides have given birth to countless offspring throughout the hundreds of years they've been living as vampires. They themselves were created from the living, but their children were not. They were born of the undead, and have never had the chance to come to life... or the afterlife vampires live. They simply are dead.Then, Dracula comes upon a mad scientist named Dr. Frankenstein, whom wants to discover the secret of creating life. He helps the doctor in his sort-of admirable task of creating life, hoping to use his creation to bring life to his children. But it is not to be. As the film opens, Dr. Frankenstein is killed by Dracula, who no longer needs him, and his monster, whom Dracula needs to give the essence of life to his children, appears to perish in a fire.A year later, Gabriel Van Helsing, a tortured man without a past is sent to Transylvania by the ""Holy Order""... An organization of all of the religions of the world. With the assistance of a trusty sidekick, the still living monster of Frankenstein and a beautiful young woman, he must hunt down and destroy Dracula before he can give life to his thousands of children.The reason I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 is that is never seems to get the recognition it deserves. It has great action, great actors, and a great story. (At least for a summer film) It's not the type of movie to be taken seriously, it's the type to sit down with some friends, have some popcorn, and get ready for a silly, scary, fun ride. I love it!. 9/10",Van Helsing
104,Terryfan,Now that I have your attention,10,3 June 2015,"Van Helsing remains one of my personal favorite movies for the fact it had everything I want in a movie like this and then some. A movie that features Count Dracula, The Brides of Dracula, The Wolf-Man and Frankenstein's Monster all together now if that is not enough to see this movie than I don't know what is.I also like the cast with Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxburgh and others. The main plot of the movie is centered around Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) along with his helper Carl (David Wenham) are send to Transylvania to help Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) to defeat Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) along with his brides Aleera (Elena Anaya), Verona (Silvia Colloca), Marishka (Josie Maran) as he seeks the Frankenstein's Monster (Shuler Hensley) with the help of Wolf- Man (Will Kemp).Having all that in one film is not something you find all the time so that's part of the reason I enjoy this movie and I also saw it in theaters opening night I set in the front row no less but I did see it in theaters.The opening pay tribute to the classic films as it was shown in Black and white like they did for movies in those days and it is a clever way to start off a wild run as the film begins to put you on edge. What makes this take of Van Helsing so cool is his weapons Hand-held Buzz Saws, Crossbow, Grappling Hook Gun, Two Revolvers, Short barreled pump action shotgun and each of his weapons are awesome in their own right and bring a lot to the character for combat against these monsters also Mr.Hyde (Voiced by Robbie Coltrane) makes a appearance as well as the first monster Van Helsing takes on in the film.The special effects for this film are well done and the transformation scenes of The Brides who can turn into vampire bats are very impressive as they used both the Actresses and C.G.I. to create the effects and it just well balance also the Wolf-Man transformation is very original instead of the old way of just growing hair to look like a wolf they took it to a new level. The action and stunt scenes are awesome as well as there is no limit but imagination from the cast and crew of this film who created stunt scenes that have never been try before in a film and they deserve a medal for the action scenes in the film and they are reason enough to watch this film if you haven't already.Hugh does a superb job as Van Helsing as you can tell he took the time to get into character, Kate is very good as Anna and you can sense the emotion from the character Richard take as the legendary vampire Dracula is both evil and chill factor as he brings a whole new level of darkness into Dracula plus when he transform into a bat you can tell this Dracula is dark and evil beyond belief, The three brides that were played by Elena, Silvia, and Josie each bring something different to the characters and let me tell you it's better if you watch the film to understand the character traitsAlso the film feature creative one liners like Van Helsing ""Now that I have your attention"" so yeah the film does feature some clever writingThe plot of the film is what helps drives the film so if you watch this film with a open mind then you might enjoy it because the film is that good it just needs some more credit than it got because I enjoy this film ever seen I saw it in theaters so watch this movie you might be surprise how fun it because it's a wild thrill ride from the startI give Van Helsing an 10 out of 10",Van Helsing
105,Howlin Wolf,How anyone can hate a film with such good humour and a sense of fun is beyond me.,7,7 June 2004,"I can certainly reconcile myself with someone's DISLIKE of the film, and I would expect such people not to view if they have a good idea beforehand that this won't light their fire; but I can't understand those who claim to love this type of genre before watching who then precede to rip the film to shreds.  The good humour mentioned in my summary isn't represented by a particular sharpness of script or a reliance on slapstick, but rather a general attitude pervading the film which smacks of those involved having a darn good time.  In the case of director Sommers this manifests itself often in a threatened overdose of CGI, but when the effects are this good such profligacy where they're concerned is hardly a problem.   The manifesto is clear almost from the start - find a wafer-thin premise with which to allot your ghouls enough screen time and then just let them loose in a suitably gothic arena.  As such, Jackman's Van Helsing often finds himself relegated to the role of a bystander, so perhaps the fact that the film bears his name is a bit of a misnomer; however, like I said, we're pretty much in contrivance territory as far as 'plot development' goes, so it should be seen as just another brand name to hang a silly hat on.  In this regard it may pain Jackman the most, since it leaves him still searching for a leading man role in the style of Crowe's ""Gladiator"" to really leave his print indelibly (""X-Men"" is an ensemble piece.)  His best moment actually comes before the main brawls begin - testing out various items of weaponary Inspector Gadget stylee!   The lack of focus on the main character shouldn't perturb the audience too much though; if they prepare themselves for a monster royal rumble in the grandest tradition then they should find themselves leaving well satisfied.",Van Helsing
106,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Entirely uninvolving early-00s Hollywood trite.,4,10 December 2020,"It's now an almost two-decades old film, but age hasn't been kind to this one. If anything it's been a vicious degrader for Van Helsing. The direction has energy to it and the actors seem to be having fun, it the writing and effects just bring everything down with it. It probably wasn't done by choice, but what's in the film is part of its baggage nonetheless: it tries to play on Universal's past Monster Movies like Dracula and Frankenstein, and fails to respect any of those stories.Van Helsing is... a film that exists. And it feels like a parallel-universe fever dream that was never real.",Van Helsing
107,pyrocitor,This was Somers' fault,6,13 August 2004,"It was obvious from the start that Van Helsing was never going to be Oscar material, but it was Stephen Somers' overconfidence in himself that caused it to tank.Let's face it: Somers is no writer. After the mummy series, he has proved himself to be an inadequate director, (although I was quite disappointed with his attempt at directing Van Helsing) and talented enough at dealing with CGI, but when he tries to put pen to paper he just ends up hurting himself, and all others concerned. The script for Van Helsing was abominable - there were only a few lines in the entire movie that I considered well written, and they were all given to Carl. I wish some directors would just stick to what they're good at, which is directing, as opposed to trying to write as well - there are many skilled screenwriters out there, why try to put them out of a job?Also, the editors seem to have fallen asleep at the wheel of this one, and the result is a head on collision. There is no sense of continuity at all in Van Helsing: it goes from having the mood of a tense action thriller to having the mood of a campy comedy. Nothing really seemed to fit together, as if they tore fragments from three different movies, mashed them together, stamped a title on it and shipped it to the theaters. I would love to know if production was rushed on this film, or if they had to move up the release date, because there are so many things that should have been changed that look like they were left in because there was no time to change them.For example, the character of Frankenstein's monster was ridiculously portrayed, with a leg squirting out steam, and the top half of his head falling off to expose his glowing, sparking blue brain. The creature is barely able to walk, and yet he swings crazily on a rope from building to building. He howls out his lines like an opera singer, which I found quite funny when I looked up Shuler Hensley who played him, and found out that he is, in fact, a singer. Was this an intentional joke? I also found it amusing that Van Helsing, a supposedly serious 'monster hunter' kept referring to Frankenstein's creation as 'Frankenstein'. This character belonged in a comedy, not a movie that was attempting to be a serious thriller.It's true that the plot is a ludicrous attempt to fit virtually every horror movie character into one story, but again, I believe that with a better director and a better script, it could have turned out passable. As it is, the movie is cringe worthy at parts, and unsatisfying for the rest. There's kind of a failed love plot between Valerious and Van Helsing, which is hinted at, but never really takes off, which gets really confusing.As well, the movie relied much too heavily on CGI, which was definitely a downside. I'm fine with characters like the werewolf or the vampires in monster form being computer generated, but it seems most Hollywood producers have forgotten the virtues of makeup. There was absolutely no need for the vampires to form those ridiculously enormous fanged mouths when they bit their victims - a vampire bite is supposed to leave two tiny holes in the neck, not tear someone's head off! And Mr Hyde, one of my favorite Horror characters, was not only completely computer generated, but also turned into a gibbering baboon! WHY CAN'T MODERN Hollywood PRODUCERS DO HYDE JUSTICE?! In League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, he was transformed into an absurdly muscled stupid guy, and in Van Helsing, they've turned him into an ape. What they should have done, is had Robbie Coltrane play the part himself with some makeup on, instead of just providing his voice, and kept Hyde more as a real person rather than a green baboon, jumping off the walls and ceiling. That would have done a lot to keep the film more grounded.The acting wasn't nearly as bad as it could have been in Van Helsing. It was David Wenham as the belligerent friar Carl who really saved the movie, taking every Lord of the Rings fan by surprise by playing a character the polar opposite of his valiant Prince Faramir. The funny voiced, bumbling and ultimately very funny Carl was definitely the highlight of the movie. Hugh Jackman did what he could with the title role, (despite his fluctuating accent: I caught some American, British, Australian, Italian and Transylvanian throughout the film. Where was Van Helsing supposed to be from, and why couldn't he keep his accent steady? This is another thing a good director would have caught) but his part was so badly written that he had to battle to make the character believable. Richard Roxburgh was campy and very over-the-top as Dracula, but good fun nonetheless. If he had toned his seemingly relentless energy down, (and with a competent director, he probably would have) and focused more on being sly and cunning, I think he could have made an excellent Dracula. Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious was all right, but she and Jackman shared very little chemistry, and she was stuck with some of the worst lines in the movie, so it was hard to properly rate her performance. Despite all my criticism, I actually enjoyed this movie. It accomplished what it wanted to be, which was an exciting action film where Van Helsing gets to go blow up a whole bunch of monsters. I just think it could have been done a whole lot better, if Somers had stayed far away from the project, which would have made it a lot more enjoyable. My rating of 6/10 isn't because the movie wasn't entertaining, but because I thought it was badly done, and could have been better.-6/10",Van Helsing
108,Maciste_Brother,Exuberantly moronic and awful,1,16 November 2004,"Leave it to Stephen Sommers do outdo himself in the schlocky film-making department (see my MUMMY II review). I've never seen a movie exuberantly & giddy in its awfulness. This film is so moronic, on so many levels that it creates an all new style of cinema, a style that will never catch on (hopefully...) if one looks at the disappointing box office. The ""filmmaker"" doesn't care for anything but big noisy moments where everyone is screaming, or falling off of this wall or that cliff, all done in a extreme schlocky manner, including an orgy of terrible CGI, bad makeup, stupid characters and a plethora of incongruous elements so disparate that the end product looks like it was truly dreamed up by a 5 year old boy suffering from extreme ADD.Sommers actually tried to make Van Helsing into a medieval James Bond, with the villain, being a campy Dracula (and his three hysterical bimbos) trying to destroy the world with their GREMLIN-like offsprings by having them energized by the ""lifeforce"" from Frankenstein's Monster. If that made any sense to you, you need to see a shrink!The film is filled with soooooooooooooo many mistakes and goofs that it defies total logic, even for a film that belongs in the horror/fantasy genre. If werewolves only change in moonlight, how come Anna's brother was a werewolf during the daytime? Helsing recklessly firing his automatic crossbow in that village, even if there are people all around...I'm surprised no one was accidentally killed. Why did the lightnings strike the centuries-old stone overpass when the goofy Friar tried to cross it? And what happens to Anna at the climax. Moments like these basically show how Sommers was just winging it (and then some...) and had no idea what to do with Universal's classic monsters. The scene when Frankenstein's Monster swings across the overpass, only to crash through a window and tackles the female vampire, accidentally saving Anna, is by far the DUMBEST scene ever conceived in the history of cinema. That scene is filled with so many mistakes (why doesn't Anna just leave the room?) that Ed Wood would have been jealous of Sommers for creating something that actually eclipses everything the legendary bad filmmaker ever tried to make.VAN HELSING is definitely one of the worst films ever made!",Van Helsing
109,BrandtSponseller,"Double-O Van Helsing, Superhero",10,11 March 2005,"First a word of warning. There are a number of people who would be best advised to avoid Van Helsing. If you dislike cgi, if you're a purist, if you're looking for something ""realistic"", or if you're looking for a slower-moving, understated film that's a deep character study, you'll more than likely hate this film.Set around the turn of the 20th Century, Van Helsing features the titular hero (Hugh Jackman) taking a break from his usual ""monster slayer"" activities, which are commissioned by the Catholic Church, to pursue a grand plot initiated by Dracula (Richard Roxburg) involving the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley), the Wolf Man (Will Kemp), and the two last surviving members of a Transylvanian family that has long been battling the vampire.Van Helsing is a fast-paced, computer graphics-laden horror/adventure/fantasy film wherein Universal re-imagines its core stable of classic horror characters. I actually like cgi, I'm not a purist, I love the genres--I'm not looking for realism, and I love fast-paced action-oriented thrill rides as much if not more than I love character studies.As for the character remakes, Van Helsing becomes a slick retro-Matrix-styled macho action hero, part James Bond/007, part Indiana Jones, part Buffy the Vampire Slayer with a secret Catholic Church order filling in for the Watcher's Council and the Bond ""Q Branch"" combined. Dracula becomes a suave, scheming, mad scientist who looks like a romance novel hero. Frankenstein's Monster becomes much closer to Mary Shelley's depiction of an intelligent, loquacious, tormented, slapdash victim of a misguided doctor. And the Wolf Man, when wolf, becomes a cgi generated over-sized, super-agile, hyperactive beast. That should already turn off all of the purists.The look of the film is lush, with lots of unusual point of view shots, exotic locations and computer-generated environments. CGI is used extensively for the human characters in the film as well as the monsters--it's frequently employed to enable physics defying stunts and amazing, far-ranging ""computer camera"" transitions. Van Helsing provides a good argument for such extensive digital assistance, as many of the visuals would be simply impossible to achieve through any other means and substituting some of the creatures with mechanicals, animatronics, special effects makeup and the like would have caused the film to go far over its already outrageous estimated budget of 160 million.The plot, while not deep on characterization, couldn't be more full of events and action. Combined with the extravagant visuals and quickly changing, sprawling locations, the result is epic in scope. Director/writer Stephen Sommers, who was also responsible for remaking the image of another classic Universal character in The Mummy (1999) and The Mummy Returns (2001) (probably the reason the Mummy is not present in here), begins Van Helsing in a black and white scene that wonderfully recreates the feel of the James Whale-lensed Frankenstein films, including referencing a number of shots, scenes and characters from those classics.After the titles, we move into a color-filled world ala The Wizard of Oz while we're treated to a brief character-establishing scene of Van Helsing battling Mr. Hyde in the bell tower of Notre Dame. Sommers then quickly whisks us away to the Vatican, where Van Helsing receives his orders.This whirlwind beginning can be almost overwhelming--it certainly is visually--and it takes a moment to get up to speed and catch our breath, but once we settle into the town square of Transylvania, we're enraptured by the story and the pacing reaches a more sustainable level. Although fantastical at heart, the performances from the principle cast members help anchor the film in ""reality"". Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Roxburgh, Henley and David Wenham all turn in nuanced performances that imply the depth of character that the film does not have the time to fully explore.The intense action throughout the film combined with the cgi and spectacular sweeping camera moves often gives Van Helsing a feel somewhere between a comic book film and a video game. That fact might turn some viewers off, but as innovative, suspenseful, exciting filmic art, this is years ahead of most other recent releases. In fact, the sophisticated technological wizardry and entrancing epic storytelling is somewhat reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings films, which makes me wonder just what other viewers see in those to enable them to consistently sit high on the IMDb Top 250 list while Van Helsing struggles to attain a slightly above average rating. Perhaps Van Helsing deserves a more tempered first or second viewing from those who have summarily dismissed it due to unjustified expectations/preconceptions. This really is an outstanding film that at least deserves to be appreciated on a technical level, and should be easy enough to enjoy for its action-oriented storytelling prowess as well.",Van Helsing
110,Sirus_the_Virus,I liked it.,8,12 September 2009,"I have seen Van Helsing many, many times. I like it a lot more than a lot of other people. I did as a matter of fact find one thing about the film silly. I think the fact that these 3 monsters would be in one film is kind of weird, and Frankenstein is not supposed to be talking, he just walks around moaning. Frankenstein is the worst thing about this film. His dialogue is irritating and I wouldn't be trying to save him. Other than that, I liked the film quite a bit. It's quite a bit of fun. It got so little credit but I give it a ton of credit because of many things. I actually liked this film more than Steven Sommers's last film, The Mummy Returns. I think that Van Helsing is a lot of interesting fun.Hugh Jackman plays the title character himself. If you remember from Dracula, they hired Van Helsing to slay Dracula. Because Van Helsing is a monster hunter. Kate Beckinsale joins along for the ride as Anna Valarious, who's brother was recently turned into The Wolfman. The two of them travel down to Transylvania to stop Dracula, who is using Frankenstein's research for something evil. I think that Van Helsing is a lot of fun so I give it a thumbs up. Perhaps I am being to kind, or perhaps everyone else is retarded.",Van Helsing
111,Spuzzlightyear,A Different kind of Hell,6,25 June 2005,"Although I'm a fan of Hugh Jackman, (and yes, I HAVE seen other films besides the X-Men movies) I was thoroughly disappointed in Van Helsing. Oh, I could have seen the warning signs ahead of time, One of the more famous literary characters of all time transformed into bounty hunter (No, I haven't seen League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) and featuring creatures not seen in any Dracula story, but Hey! I was going to give this one the old college try. And, yes, by gum! I should have stuck to my guns, because this film is just plain awful. Oh sure, it's pretty to look at, and has a lot of neat special effects, but while it maybe dazzling to look at, they forgot to blue screen one important element and that's plausibility. Time after time, there are instances where I was like, how on earth did they know that was going to happen? Like when the Kate Beckensdale first meets Van Helsing, she has'nt a clue who he is, then after he's done his business, she all of a sudden knows who he is. Implausability after implausibility (the dual carriage scene? Hello?) happen, and by the end, I was like, ""Yeah, whatever"".",Van Helsing
112,RNMorton,Great intro,7,5 February 2005,"Wenham: Why is it so important to kill this Dracula? Jackman: Because he's the son of the Devil. Wenham: I mean, besides that... Methinks reports of this movie's lack of quality were overstated. Jackman is a monster-hunter hired in 1880 by the Catholic Church (!!) to travel to Transylvania and take out Count Dracula. Serendipity's Beckinsale is a very attractive and very feisty Transylvanite who's been trying the same on her own without success. Wexham (Lord of the Ring's Faramir) is Jackman's assistant along for some comic relief. If you imagine Jackman as a more talky, continental Clint Eastwood you're pretty close. They have the right concept, the right characters and the right effects (AND the right weapons for Jackman, including an automatic crossbow!), they just didn't seem to have much of a clue on what to do with them after the first 30 minutes. So they just sort of mindlessly recycle confrontations after that point. It's hard to even keep up with things except to become certain that more (often hokey) action isn't always better. You do wonder how many more times Beckinsale can bounce off the walls and still be fine. But I guess it could have been worse and I give them some credit for setting the table so nicely.",Van Helsing
113,lambiepie-2,I liked it!,6,8 May 2004,"Hello everyone..Ya know, I had one of those weeks at my job...the kind where it was 'do or die' and no matter how hard you would try...you knew when the lay-off slip comes along it would be you?Well, it wasn't me and I was over reacting. Like I feel many (not all!)who are writing adversely about this film is doing.  You see, after a week like that, I needed something to take my mind off that world. To relax, to unwind, to enjoy. I got to see Van Helsing and it did the trick. I laughed, I was entertained, I forgot about the seriousness of the world and enjoyed mindless, fun entertainment for a few hours. Does anybody know how rare that is these days? Some folks wish to be a ""shock-jock"" type of critic or seem to want to look for so much in nothing -- and sometimes, you just need to let your mind go, have an imagination and be open. Van Helsing is not a Documentary, it's not an independent film, its not an art house film. This is one of those films that just wants you to have a good time.I liked this film very much, I liked the CGI - to a point (okay, I'm a fan of Lon Chaney and Lon Chaney Jr.) and I liked Hugh. I've enjoyed Kevin O'Connor of late and knew that was him as Igor..well, he had the best line in the film that just cracked me up. The ""brides"" made ALL the guys from 15 to 21 get REALLY interested in the film...as did the character Anna. (Isn't that what it's about these days?!) And the Monk..well..let me just say, bravo to the actor for making a ""departure"" from his last known famous role. He did well. And it was kinda..nice..seeing the old Universal creatures on screen in THIS the new millenium, even though I loved them better in the old films, but WHO is looking at the old films? Well, this is one of those movies that may MAKE newer moviegoers do that. At least, I hope so.Entertaining, fun, visually interesting. Was worth my matinee money.  For those who want more ""seriousness"" in their plots, please go to an art house film. (But it's my guess that those who have something to say against this film, wouldn't be caught dead going into an art house to see a 'serious' film.)So lighten up. Clear your mind, go see Van Helsing just to enjoy yourself in mindless entertainment! Life right now is too short and too serious for real to argue over something so imaginative.",Van Helsing
114,sarastro7,"Yes, it's a mess, but...",6,6 May 2004,"*Here there be spoilers!*Once again, a movie where viewer reactions run the full gamut from ""great!"" to ""terrible!"" - which must mean it's an interesting movie!And so it is. Despite what some people claim, it actually has an interesting and complex story: Dracula and his three brides are desperate for progeny, and have set huge plans in motion to that end; plans which comprise the culmination of the movie. And Gabriel Van Helsing himself... well, let's just say that his first name is no coincidence. Unfortunately, the story is told in fits and starts, parts of it even backwards. The narrative structure is a mess. Which is probably the reason that some of the audience fail to even notice the coherent story. Seriously.What I was feeling during most of this movie was: Rewrites galore. We have here a movie that starts out as comedy, and then gets more and more serious as it progresses, ending up as a tragedy! It seems to me that the script was originally serious and tragic, and then sometime in the production process some Hollywood executives decreed that no-one could take this seriously, so it had to be turned into a tongue-in-cheek comedy.This might have worked if they'd gone comical all the way. But they left in the tragic finale, with the death of the heroine! That was, excuse me for saying so, real stupid. (On the other hand, it occurs to me that the writers may have intended her death as a happy ending for *her*, since it meant she got to be with her dead family - but that's really too esoteric for most viewers, myself included.) Of course, I may be wrong about the rewrites, and this thing was a mess of bad writing from the beginning. Entirely possible. But I like the other theory better.This movie actually does have a lot of things going for it. For a movie buff, its myriad references to other movies, from Aliens to Sherlock Holmes, are very entertaining to spot. For this reason alone, I wouldn't put it past this movie to eventually develop a cult audience. There are also a couple of good lines (""Do unto others, before they do unto you!""), although only a few.The SFX were impressive. Some say they're cheesy, but that's just not true. The effects in *Underworld* were cheesy (and I still liked it!), but the ones in Van Helsing are MUCH better. There's so much good stuff here. Castles, cityscapes, rock bridges, animated paintings... Dracula's brides are very cleverly done, esp. when they change into their human forms. And the final transformation of Gabriel into the Wolf Man is great!
However - when all is said and done, the movie really is a mess. There are lots of situations with which a lot could have been done, but they merely serve as throwaways. There doesn't seem to be any deeper meaning to any of the action (except that it's all God's will or something similarly silly). And in the end the story doesn't satisfy. In the end, this is just another B-movie with only one real reason to watch it: the female lead.Kate Beckinsale is a vision of beauty and coolness. I never liked corsets until this movie. Her dark eyes and shock of dark-brown curls are absolutely delicious. Her character is stylish, spiritted and courageous, with just a hint of vulnerability. If you don't like Kate Beckinsale, you, sir, have no taste.6 out of 10.",Van Helsing
115,suite92,A wonderfully constructed remix of modern fantasy themes.,9,20 September 2016,"The Three Acts:The initial tableau: There is a lot going on in this film. The initial context comes from four vignettes: (1) Doctor Frankenstein has successfully brought life to his cobbled together monster. Dracula, who funded Frankenstein, figures that his investment has borne fruit, and kills the doctor. The monster is enraged by this, and manages to escape Dracula and the mob with their torches. Dracula recruits Igor.(2) Van Helsing confronts Mr. Hyde in Paris at the behest of a secret group operating out of the Vatican. In doing such work, Van Helsing has become a wanted criminal of international renown. He has no public support whatsoever, and is hated by many.(3) At the Vatican, Van Helsing is dressed down by Cardinal Jinette. He gets a new assignment: to protect the Valerian family (Anna and Velkan), and to help them kill Count Dracula in a fulfillment of a family oath. The oath was that the family would not enter Heaven until Dracula was destroyed. Van Helsing meets the friar named Carl, who is both timid and talented.(4) Velkan and Anna attempt to trap the werewolf that has been terrorising the village. Velkan kills the werewolf, but is bitten in the process.Delineation of conflicts: Velkan becomes a rather powerful werewolf. Dracula would use Velkan for his own purposes. Van Helsing and Anna have a chewy first meeting, then agree to oppose Dracula's intentions toward Velkan.Dracula and his trio of mates (Aleera, Verona, and Marishka) want their undead offspring to have life. Van Helsing, Anna, and the Vatican want them to die: Van Helsing, to follow orders; Anna, to save her family from Purgatory; the Vatican, to drive the spawn of Satan from the face of the Earth.Frankenstein's monster would like to live in peace with some degree of freedom. Dracula wants to consume him to transfer life to his offspring. The Vatican wants the monster dead since he's not precisely human, and his life was not given to him by God. Carl would like to comply with the Vatican's wishes, but cannot in good conscience.Dracula wants Van Helsing dead for strong reasons of his own. Van Helsing, Carl, Anna, and the monster are opposed.Resolution: Excellent, difficult, and harmonious.",Van Helsing
116,mentalcritic,A disturbingly bad idea...,1,10 October 2004,"The idea for a sequel to the woefully miscast 1990s production of Dracula had been floating around for some years when the decision was made to make Van Helsing younger and turn him into a mercenary. Anyone who is aware of how religious fanaticism and science were virtually at war in the nineteenth century can see how inane this idea is. Hollywood makes its Christian ownership all the more obvious, however, by failing to recognise this basic fact.That aside, the story started out well, with a raid upon the Frankenstein manor culminating with Dracula and the monster taking off to parts unknown. The problem is, once the titular hero is introduced, it is all downhill. The most profound example of the film's lack of respect for the audience's intelligence lies in the scene when Van Helsing meets Whatshername. As the harpies come out of the woodwork to assault the town, Van Helsing sets about taking them down with an automatic crossbow. So far, so good, but the way in which Van Helsing fires, one would be hard pressed to credit him with being able to hit the sidewalk using a can of paint. Naturally, no villagers are killed by friendly fire despite the fact that hundreds of crossbow bolts are fired in every direction.It gets worse from there. Much, much worse. One of my favourite scenes is the vampire egg-hatching sequence. Seriously, our heroes just wander through this area with no regard for what might happen if they are discovered. The usage the villains get is incredibly uneven, too. The Frankenstein monster is little more than a plot device, and the Werewolf is only there to facilitate how Dracula is brought down. Making this all about Dracula might have worked if Dracula had not been so incredibly non-charismatic.After Underworld, Kate Beckinsale needed to appear in something decent fast before she killed her career. Van Helsing is therefore the definition of a bad career move. If Beckinsale is capable of defining her characters through anything other than costume changes, she'd best prove it in her next appearance. Van Helsing sure hasn't done David Wenham any favours, either. The goofy sidekick routine is now so old and tired that he starts being annoying as soon as his character is introduced, and never really stops.I won't get into the use of special effects here, as while they were quite obviously the focus of the film, they aren't the real problem. Nor is the acting as such, although obviously it didn't work against the limitations of the material. The problem here is that the story was given about as much thought as a pop song, if that. Even after watching the film for a second or third time, one is hard pressed to remember the precise details of the story. The words ""tacked on"" can be used a lot to describe some plot elements, with the final fight between Van Helsing's group and Dracula being convoluted beyond belief. It's almost like time slows down during this part of the film.I gave Van Helsing a one out of ten. After such fun pieces as The Mummy, one would have expected something better out of Stephen Sommers. With this film, he gets dangerously close to the status of one-trick pony. It defies belief that Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are not rising to meet production budgets when they are spending said budgets on dreck like this.",Van Helsing
117,vip_ebriega,"VAN HELSING: Monsters, action, horrible script.",5,12 September 2009,"My Take: A dumb, but visually-stunning adventure with some neat action and some truly terrible dialog. If there's a weakness I have, it's how I keep changing my opinion on the movies I watch. I saw VAN HELSING back then, sort of liked it then forgot much about it. Since I have a vague memory of VAN HELSING since then, I just dismissed it as the CGI effects-laden mess that everyone else called. But upon seeing it again a few weeks ago, it fared much better than I expected. If I wrote about VAN HELSING back then, I would have given it the 3 stars I'm giving it now; It's enjoyable and occasionally exciting, but still pretty silly and quite forgettable.I didn't really grow up with the old Universal monster movies (these movie are even older than my parents are!), but their impact is undeniable. Whether or not you have seen all of those original B&W classics, you are maybe living under a rock or something if you don't even know who Dracula is. These guys are the big leagues! Our generation is grown up on movie serial killers and soulless slashers who have none of these immortals' depth or class; You can actually find something to identify with in these monsters. And here they are, all together in one movie, like a greatest hits collection strewn together like a Frankenstein's Monster. VAN HELSING's great B&W opening alone is a great homage to the classic monster movies and probably the best moment in the entire film.The rest is pretty much standard action-with-CGI fare. Van Helsing, an intelligent old hero in the old Dracula classics, is turned into a comic-book action hero here (played by Hugh Jackman) complete with gadgets, a comic-relief sidekick, a secret organization he works for (a secret Vatican organization with more James Bond 007 references you will ever need in a movie) and the girl. But regardless of his presence, Jackman could have done so much more to the role. The movie was pure intentional camp to be sure, the least Jackman should have done is to add more humor and edge to the character. Worse still is Kate Beckinsale (a fine actress, need I mention) who plays vampire hunter Anna Valerious. She shares very little chemistry with Jackman's Gabriel Van Helsing, while an adventure movie of this kind could have done so much more. Then there's the CGI, superior and all, is just a bit too overcrowded at times. Did the movie really need a CGI Dr Jekyll/Mr. Hyde? And don't get me started on Dracula's screeching overbearing wives who turn into flying bat-like creatures (which makes me wonder if the real actresses who played them weren't CGI characters themselves!).Director Stephen Sommers of THE MUMMY pictures could have made another purely enjoyable blockbuster, but this flawed, silly yet marginally entertaining one lacks the charm of his previous works. One thing I do remember enjoying in VAN HELSING is the action, and they're still pretty gripping this time around. Sometimes though, I wish that Sommers realize that CGI without a lot of fun in them are just lifeless. And that script, bleh! Rating: **1/2 out of 5.",Van Helsing
118,gftbiloxi,I Used The Fast Forward on My Remote A Lot,2,29 March 2005,"In the 1940s Universal Studios attempted to re-energize horror films at the box office by churning out movies that crammed as many famous monsters into the plot line as possible. The result was usually more notable for being silly than effective, and in spite of its highly touted CGI effects VAN HELSING is sillier still.Suggested by the vampire hunter of Bram Stoker's novel Dracula, the film presents a young and sexy Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) who is in the employ of a secret sect of the Roman Catholic Church run along James Bond lines. After a little run in with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvannia along with a trusty Friar as sidekick. There they promptly meet a sexy vampire hunting gypsy princess, and the three promptly encounter the Wolf Man, the Frankestein Monster, Dracula, Dracula's Brides, and even Dracula's Babies. Who would have thunk it? The CGI effects are impressive and the occasional homages to the original Universal Studio horror films of the 1930s and 1940s are occasionally amusing--but the whole thing very quickly collapses into a lot of visual and audio noise, and there isn't much to hold it together. After about half an hour I began to use the fast forward button on my remote a lot. It's a case of the director, actors, and special effects people having more fun than the audience.The film is presently available to the homemarket on DVD. The transfer is quite good, although to my eye CGI effects do not work as well on the home screen as they do on the big screen. There are also a handful of bonuses, none of which are greatly interesting or particularly well done. Final take: this a movie that seems to be made by and for a bunch of hyperactive fourteen year old boys without a whole lot of imagination.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Van Helsing
119,CitizenCaine,Disappointing Summer Action,5,4 September 2004,"One of the most hyped summer movies in recent memory, Van Helsing was supposed to become another franchise. A television series was purportedly in the works, and, with Stephen Sommers writing and directing it, what could go wrong? The film never made back its production costs at the box office. Hugh Jackman stars as Van Helsing, an Indiana Jones-like vampire (and all around monster) slayer. The film opens with a richly-detailed nod to Universal's original Frankenstein from 1931. The similarities end there however. Somehow I had the feeling that this film would rely on some of the original horror tenants of chills, scares, shocks, and pathos. There was little of any of the four. Instead, there was an Indiana Jones vampire slayer flying or hopping from one CGI sequence and one fantastic set decoration to another. Soon, Van Helsing meets up with Anna Valerious, played by British beauty Kate Beckinsale. She and her family have beefs with Dracula, played by Richard Roxburgh, and so she reluctantly joins forces with Van Helsing in order to vanquish Dracula. Dracula has plans to bring his ""children"" to life through some shady method or other. Roxburgh plays Dracula as more modern than the period portrayed with unintentionally funny dialog, and, at times, a poor Bela Lugosi imitation. Beckinsale is very appealing with her corset/goth look, but her character is underdeveloped, as are all the characters, and she seems to do little except be highlighted in isolated battles with the dark forces or be in trouble. David Wenham adds welcome comic relief as Carl the monk, Van Helsing's sidekick. Shuler Hensley is also appealing as a Frankenstein that seems to be more human than ones we've encountered in previous films. Elena Anaya and the other vampire brides add an R rated sensuality, which seems inappropriate at times to this PG-13 movie. The real star of the film is the art direction and set decoration, which was to be preserved in a television series until the idea was later scrapped. The problem with the film is its computer game look and pace, which do little for character and plot development. What was the Dr. Jekyll character doing in the film besides serving as an excuse for a ferocious CGI battle with Van Helsing? During some of the battles, it seemed like characters swung around with relative ease and too much reckless abandon that I thought I was watching stunt doubles instead of characters. The horse coach sequence, although exciting, was hopelessly phony at the key moment. We had Dracula, Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll, and the wolf man. The mummy, also made by Stephen Sommers, was conspicuously absent. The plot tying the monsters together was very unsatisfying. One horror legend would have been enough with a better story and richer characters. Roxburgh would not have been enough to carry the horror side alone, which explains why really none of the actors stood out. The parts were not written well to begin with. The ending also seemed out of place, as there was never much of a romance between Jackson and Beckinsale either. Still the film entertains in a hokey, non-thinking sort of way. The quick pace is necessary both because of the movie's running time and its lack of character/story content. It's a guilty pleasure to be sure. ** of 4 stars.",Van Helsing
120,jon.h.ochiai,So many monsters...,7,10 May 2004,"I really did not know what to expect from Stephen Sommers' ""Van Helsing"" at least from the trailers. Was it going to be a light-hearted adventure, a classic tale of good versus evil, or just plain silly and entertaining? A key draw is Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, who is a great stage and screen actor, and this movie generation's classic leading man. Kate Beckinsale is a talented and versatile actress, who is stunningly beautiful. Well, ""Van Helsing"" is all of that, and possibly has the most monsters per capita, than any movie in recent memory. These are not exactly ""props"". Sommers' movie not only opens in black and white; it also dense packs Dr. Frankenstein, Frankenstein's Monster, and Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). And there are more monsters to come including, the Werewolf, and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Fortunately, Director Sommers ends the movie well in the last 45 minutes or so, melding the story together after a very unfocused and chaotic start. Credit Jackman and Breckensale for keeping our attention amidst the chaos. They are very attractive actors, who also have a natural chemistry. ""Van Helsing"" ends up being a wild fun ride. Perhaps the best thing about Van Helsing is Hugh Jackman. He has a commanding presence, a great voice, and is totally charismatic. It also seems that this younger vampire hunter Van Helsing, the nemesis of Dracula, has been reinvented for Jackman. He is similar to X-Men's Logan, who has a mysterious past and no memory of it. Also it seems that this Van Helsing is much like a James Bond for the Vatican-- James Bond may be the next role in Jackman's near future. Anyway, Van Helsing is off to Transylvania with cool weapons invented by sidekick Carl (the Vatican's ""Q"") to vanquish the evil Count Dracula. There they join forces with the warrior Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). The Valerious family has sworn vengeance on Dracula over the centuries. In an intriguing twist, it turns out that Dracula holds the key to Van Helsing's past. Then the story becomes extremely convoluted. Jekyll and Hyde are thrown in for no reason. Dracula requires Frankenstein's monster to ensure his legacy. Van Helsing must stop Dracula before he himself is turned to a Werewolf. This really would give something away if the story were more coherent, but it is not. The special effects in Van Helsing are state-of-the-art; however, the writing is not. Sommers does recover at the end-- it ends satisfyingly. Apparently, Van Helsing has a presold sequel. Perhaps, that will be more story and character driven, and the role expanded deserving of Jackman's talents. Jackman is good here regardless. He plays Van Helsing as darkly heroic, romantic, and intense. He also displays a sense of humor. Kate Beckinsale is strong and charming as Van Helsing's partner and love interest. They are a great looking couple, and that does not hurt the movie. ""Van Helsing"" is silly fun, though it is frustrating to watch at times. It has enough star power from Jackman and Beckinsale, to engage and entertain for a couple of hours. A few less monsters and a cohesive story may have made a big difference.",Van Helsing
121,phanthinga,After 14 years the movie still hold up,10,21 August 2018,"Stephen Sommers is a guy know how to make movies with a silly premise very entertaining and with his run from The Mummy in 1999 to Van Helsing in 2004 he single handedly create his own cinematic universe of old Universal monsters dub as The Dark Universe today without knowing it.Van Helsing is a comic book style movie set in the Victorian age with a dash of Steampunk technology in to the mix where vampire,werewolf and the Frankenstein monster running amok and the onlyone who can stop them is Van Helsing the legendary monster hunter played by Hugh Jackman along with his sidekick Carl the Monk and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale who also a famous vampire/vampire killer in her Underworld franchise.I first time saw the movie when I was young and love it just like I did with The Mummy and now when I already got some knowledge about these kind of movies to my surprise director Stephen Sommers hasn't done anything since his last movie Odd Thomas in 2013 which is really weird cause although most of his movies never hold anything deep or thought provoking but they are all perfect popcorn entertainment.",Van Helsing
122,jluis1984,An awful and pointless although entertaining movie,4,6 December 2005,"Director Stephen Sommers surprised the world in 1999 with a very fresh take on Universal Studio's classic ""The Mummy"", giving it new life while transforming it from Gothic horror to action-adventure in ""Indiana Jones""' vein.Now, and after an almost-as-good sequel, he tries it again, this time with the other classic monster from Universal's horror movies: Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. Sadly, this time Sommers does a terribly bad job with the script and what could had been his masterpiece ended in one of the most awful movies of 2004: ""Van Helsing"".Using the name and the mystique of the famous vampire hunter of Bram Stoker's novel ""Dracula"", Sommers links the three monsters by turning the old scientist into some kind of Vatican's 007 complete with fantastic artifacts and macho attitude.The idea, at its very core, is very good, after all, who better than Van Helsing to fight the classic monsters of Universal's golden age of horror? Too bad that the idea was developed with bad results.Hugh Jackman stars as Gabriel Van Helsing, an agent of the Vatican whose job is to kill monsters. He is sent to Transilvania to save a gypsy family who has been fighting vampire king Dracula for centuries; their problem: if the family line extinguishes before Dracula's death, the entire clan will go to hell. To make things worse, there are only two survivors: Anna and Velkan Valerious(played by Kate Beckinsale and Will Kemp respectively).The script is weak. That is the main problem here, since it's full of plot holes that the audience may end up wondering what the hell is the point of the movie. While Sommers tries to put mysteries to keep the audience thrilled, the story goes on circles and never fully develops the potential of the many subplots thrown in there.To make things worse, the acting is terribly bad in most cases. While Jackman and David Wenham(as Van Helsing's sidekick) do their best with the bad script, the rest of the cast goes over-the-top in scenes that are so unintentionally funny that one ends up wondering if this is not a farcical comedy(like the brilliant ""Young Frankenstein"") instead of Sommers' recent action blockbuster.Sommers direction still is solid, and the action scenes will keep you on the edge of the seat. The SFX for the most part are very well done and the beautiful locations worth the ticket. It's a shame that the script and the acting ruins what could have been a very good movie.3/10",Van Helsing
123,petra_ste,Van Boring,4,9 October 2008,"I didn't expect Van Helsing to be Citizen Kane. I didn't WANT it to be Citizen Kane. Popcorn movies have a dignity and a reason to exist, and there is place for a cheesy werewolf/vampire feature in cinema.Sadly, Van Helsing is a bloated mess. It bombards the audience with a moronic plot full of arbitrary rules, stupid McGuffins and absurd twists. A convoluted story should not be confused with texture or genuine complexity; for these movies, simplicity is a virtue. Instead we get a lot of mumbo- jumbo about the relationship between werewolves and Dracula, an antidote, Frankenstein being necessary to reanimate the count's spawn, and other preposterous rules.However, what drives a stake through Van Helsing (har har) is the mediocrity of action scenes. With an overuse of awful CGI and a cartoonish ""everything can happen!"" attitude, they are pointless and incompetent. See the vampire attack, with Beckinsale's Anna bumping everywhere like a ping-pong ball in a tornado, without any consequence or sense of danger. And that silly werewolf kept springing out of nowhere like a furry Jack in the Box puppet. One is tempted to say Van Helsing resembles a video game, but the truth is no major modern video game is so badly plotted and devoid of atmosphere. It's more like one of those platform games from the middle Nineties, with lots of jumps and lots of swinging on vines.Jackman as the titular monster-slayer comes across as sedate and moribund. Beckinsale provides the eye-candy, so the camera can PG-13 leer at her tight trousers and cleavage, admittedly quite a sight. Roxbourgh has an original take on Dracula: he portrays the legendary monster as a campy, effete clown. Wenham as the Q-like comic sidekick/inventor is the only mildly likable character in this whole disaster.4/10",Van Helsing
124,juliankennedy23,"Someday the mountain might get 'em, but the law never will",7,13 November 2018,"Van Helsing: 7 out of 10: The titular Van Helsing finds himself sent on a mission to Transylvania to hunt Dracula and prevent a family of Gypsies from being trapped in purgatory.This is a very big film that is at times overstuffed with action cliffhangers and cameos. It has Dragula, Frankenstein's monster, a werewolf, Dracula's brides, Dracula's babies, Dracula's Oompa Loompas, other vampires, other werewolves, gypsies with torches, Victor Frankenstein, Dr. Jeykyll, Mr. Hyde, Van Helsing, Igor, and Kate Beckinsale.Van Helsing is overall a fun time that is appropriate monster mayhem for the whole family. The film suffers from some teensy tiny flaws that take it down a notch from writer/director Stephen Sommers previous Mummy films. But like that very thin mint fed to Mr. Creosote in the Meaning of Life any one of these could cause the entire experience to explode. What follows is a non-comprehensive list of teeny tiny Van Helsing issues.A: Dracula is kind of well... lame. Richard Roxburgh's take on the count does eventually grow on one with his tongue firmly planted in cheek. This is as much his movie as it is Van Helsing's. One wonders what the movie could have done with Gary Oldman or even Tom Cruise in the role. Roxburgh simply doesn't have enough menace and he seems more of a put-upon husband with three wives than an actual bad guy.B: There is a special effects failure from which the movie has trouble recovering. About two-thirds of the way through the movie Van Helsing jumps a chasm with a carriage being pulled by four horses. A very large chasm. You know the bridge is out kind of thing. The kind of chasm that the General Lee would balk at jumping. It is ridiculous on paper and looks even worse on screen.C: In fact, the whole movie seems to have a problem with physics. No one seems to have mass and even allowing that Van Helsing, Dracula, and the werewolves are indestructible it doesn't explain why Kate Beckinsale isn't dead like thirty times from falls alone.D: The movie also has a problem keeping itself grounded. Transylvania seems to have nothing but sheer cliffs and the moon is full every three days. Everything is a cliffhanger and the film never takes a moment to breathe in its over two hours running time lest it not be able to fit in one more set piece, cliffhanger, or character reveal.There is more good than bad overall, however. With various characterizations such as Dracula's brides and Frankenstein being particular standouts. And while one can nitpick for days (Why exactly does Dracula even want children?) a fun time is in store from a live-action cartoon point of view.And now for something completely different. Since this is an overstuffed movie why not an overstuffed review.First of all, I know that Video Game adaptations were box office poison n 2004 (and not much better now) but certainly, the makers of Van Helsing had to realize at some point they were making an almost perfect Castlevania movie. Change Kate Beckinsale's last name from Valerious to Belmont and change nothing else and one does have a scene for scene recreation of Castlevania.
,
The good folks in charge of the Universal Monsters clearly didn't look at the response to this movie before starting their Dark Universe. I mean at least this one had a successful Mummy movie proceeding it... Cough Cough...
Too much FX, not enough characterization, and it never takes a breath. A fun, if exhausting, ride Van Helsing holds its own overall.",Van Helsing
125,gregsrants,Hollywood tries to cheat and pack in the familiar faces,4,9 May 2004,"If there was any truth to the notion that Hollywood has run out of new ideas and even less unique characters, one has to look no further than the recent crop of box office fodder we have been fed over the past few years.In efforts to rip our hard earned dollar from our pockets with once proven yet stale characters, the cinema has tried a new approach of coupling these faded franchises into the same story.  One only needs look at Freddy vs. Jason, Aliens vs. Predator or even the notably bland League of Extraordinary Gentlemen to see the newest trend of familiar characters against a common enemy.The recent attempt at this warfare tactic is the biggest and boldest risk yet in Universal Studio's Van Helsing.  With adds swarming about a one man's crusade against the Wolfman, Dracula and Frankenstein it's a way of almost tricking the audience into thinking they are getting three movies for the price of one.  Add Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde who makes a rather large cameo early on in the film and you have seasons one through four of the X-Files minus any alien abductions.For those of you who may not be aware of this almost a quarter of a billion dollar adventure (this number includes the lucrative advertising budget and sequel rights), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in the X-Men franchise) plays the title character who is commissioned by the church to rid the world of the evil creatures it harbors.  After a memorable chase with Mr. Hyde, Van Helsing is dispatched to Eastern Europe to stop Dracula and his gang of monsters from channeling the efforts of Dr. Frankenstein and bringing to life the dead offspring of the Count and his wives.Conceding that this is not enough to propel a blockbuster film, we also are introduced to the lovely Kate Beckinsale (who no doubt was still wearing the same wire harness she perfected in last years Underworld) as Anna Valerious, the last in a line of hereditary challenges for the Dracula family.  Van Helsing's role is then quite clear, he must save the Valerious family and set them free from purgatory, foil the plans of the count, hide his decision to save the Frankenstein monster from his superiors while trying to race against time and find not only the answers to his own legacy but also to inject himself with a cure for the Wolfman curse to which he has been infected.  Whew!You would think that with all this going on, all these familiar evil characters that we grew up on with Saturday afternoon matinees, that we would be in for a roller coaster ride of the can't fail variety.
If you thought as did I, you are in for a disappointment.As a critic, it is always easier to pick out the bad in films, so let me start there.  Even though writer/director Stephen Sommers has given Universal an incredibly lucrative franchise in The Mummy (followed by The Mummy Returns and The Scorpion King, the three combined for nearly $850 million at the worldwide box office), he has never been one much for character development.  A master of the special effects and CGI action, I would expect that when storyboarded, this film must have looked incredibly fun with the studio licking its chops at the theme park possibilities. However, when put on the big screen, the characters were all bland. Dracula was never frightening, Frankenstein was a wimp (granted if you read the book, it stays true to his good nature), and only the Wolfman offers any kind of real peril.With the supporting cast as backdrops, the hopes would be that the leading crew of Jackman and Beckinsale would rise to the occasion, but together they offer not one ounce of chemistry and although human fighting the supernatural they seem to be able to fall from incredible distances or get thrown into walls without as much as an Advil for back pain.  If these characters don't seem to falter after being manhandled by creatures ten times their strength, then where is the adventures?  Where is the sense of urgency?Granted, I am not blaming the two leads for this mess.  They really didn't have anything to work with.  The whole cast are forced to not show smiles while uttering such as `I don't know if you've looked in the mirror lately, but you kind of stick out in a crowd' (said to Frankenstein) or `Too bad, so sad' as orated to Van Helsing to by one of the Counts evil brides.  Even when they are trying to be funny, they don't seem to hit on any consistent cylinders.  It actually reminded me of The Mummy Returns in 2001 when I witnessed what I still profess today to be the only movie that has over 50 attempts at humour and does not hit one note.  Van Helsing is just as bad. When a friar walks into a room just vacated by the Wolfman, he asks rhetorically, `What smells like wet dog in here?' and when Igor is asked why he tortures the Wolfman he says, `It's what I do' in a very annoying accent. When these and countless other expected catchphrases were thrust upon the audience, I swear, you would hear crickets in the background where the director paused in the action expecting laughter.To give the film its chops, I will say that the production values and the special effects are top rate.  In fact, that is the only reason why the film will be a success and not end up on cable as quick as LXG.  The Wolfman was evolved to a point where watching even An American Werewolf in London might now finally seem dated.  And it was more 21st century to see Dracula turn into a six-foot bat instead of a flying rodent that we were used to in the old Bela Legosi films.This movie is however critic proof.  Fans of the genre have been awaiting it with bated breath and the 2004 summer film fleet is now aligned and firing with this early entry.   It is just too bad that they couldn't have done more or in looked at previous attempts and done less.  If Daredevil and Electra fighting Bullseye and The Kingpin were a benchmark, Universal should have taken a page from this lesson to learn that more sometimes isn't always better.All this said, I am developing a script for Pee Wee Herman vs. the Star Wars Jawa's that I hope you buy into next year.",Van Helsing
126,ja_kitty_71,An awesome Steampunk action/horror film,10,24 October 2008,"This is an awesome steampunk action/horror film about vampire/monster hunter named Gabriel Van Helsing (X-Men's Hugh Jackman). He is based on the character Abraham Van Helsing, created by Bram Stoker; of course he was made younger to appeal to a more modern era, and his name was changed from Abraham to Gabriel. Gabriel works at what-it-looks like a 19th century paranormal secret service in the Vatican.But he oftens complains to the Cardinal Jinette that he is a murderer, killing monsters which were once good, decent people. However, he continues to do his job so that innocent people can no longer be harmed by the monsters who terrorize the world. Gabriel also had lost his memory, and has only clues to his history and true identity.In the film Van Helsing (along with Friar Carl) was sent from Rome to a protect and aid a gypsy princess/monster hunter named Anna and to help in her family's quest in slaying Dracula. Anna, who is very bullheaded, didn't want to accept his help. However, before she had the chance to formally object, the village was viciously attacked by the three brides of Dracula: Aleera, Verona, and Marishka. Anna fled, knowing that the brides had come for her to finish killing off her family. This left Van Helsing fighting Marishka (the blonde bride), whom he shot with arrows with holy water on them and killed her. After that Van Helsing gains Anna's trust and she decides to work with him and Carl.

OK, I guess that was the intention of the producers, and of Sommers himself (The Mummy, The return Of The Mummy, The goddamn mummy strikes back -he's sort an specialist of s***ting on classic terror stuff) ; but still I think you can make such a poor product like this spending 100 times less money than they have.Conclussions: they could've made a nice Playboy Gothic-video using the female cast in Van Helsing, and maybe give the rest of the money to someone with ideas, talent, and something to say. That of course would happen in a perfect world. In this world of us they prefer to let audiences (the real targets of this kind of trash) think that Van Helsing was a shooter, that Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein knew each other and shared some bears and some ""brides"", and that Mr. Hyde was the cigar-smoking punk cousin of The Hulk.

130,FilmOtaku,Unbelievably awful,1,10 May 2004,"-Spoilers-Where do I begin?  Besides currently entertaining a class-action suit to sue for my time back, I'm compelled to paraphrase Homer Simpson and just write `Screw Sommers' for the next twelve lines, but I suppose I need to try to put into words why I think this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire LIFE.  It wasn't the fact that the CGI (with some slight exceptions of the work on Dr. Jekyll  but only slight and fleeting) was terrible.  It wasn't the fact that there was a plethora of plot holes and loose ends (even allowing for a franchise).  Nor could it simply be explained by the fact that the story progressed as quickly as your average daytime soap opera.  (You mean that they are STILL at the same party and I missed six months of the show?)  This movie was horrible because it tried to be something it just absolutely couldn't  a coherent, action-oriented popcorn flick.  I was aghast within the first three or four minutes, and quickly felt like Malcolm McDowell in `A Clockwork Orange' being forced to watch horrible imagery on the screen. I tried my damndest, but I couldn't even take the opportunity for a two hour nap because this film was like a bad accident  you want to look away, every fiber of your being is telling you to look away, but you just can't because you are so astonished at how horrible the display before you is.  I can't remember exactly when, because I think my body went into shock halfway through as a defense mechanism, but I was so appalled by the corniness and sheer awfulness of a particular scene, that I actually turned to a complete stranger next to me who was alone and completely slouched down with a look on his face like he had not only just run over his dog, but was forced to do it again, and said, `Okay, seriously?!' and garnered a sympathetic eye roll in return.  -Definite Spoilers Ahead-I'm not even going to comment on the acting because there WAS no acting, except that Kate Beckinsale had an accent which ranged from Count Chocula to something completely indistinguishable, and made for some pretty hilarious viewing. Oh wait, I wasn't supposed to laugh at that  I was supposed to laugh at Igor walking around muttering under his breath how it's always, `Do THIS Igor, do THAT Igor.'  I also don't think I was supposed to be laughing when Beckinsale was telling people to run inside to protect themselves from Dracula's brides, yet she and everyone else ran circles around the town square for about five minutes  I was supposed to find the fact that the Friar, when asked by a townsperson what she could do to make up for him saving her life, ends up calling in his favor by sleeping with her.  (Not after reminding us for the 100th time that he's not yet a monk he's a FRIAR.)  And I certainly don't think I was supposed to laugh at the Frankenstein Popsicle (why the hell was Frankenstein in the film in the first place, and secondly, why was he frozen in a block of ice?!)  I was supposed to be worried that these jokers were going to get out of Dracula's Castle alive.  Unfortunately the only thing I was worried about was whether or not I could control myself long enough to sit through this piece of garbage without trying to sabotage the film and end the misery.  The fate of Kate Beckinsale was promising for about a tenth of a second, until Sommers apparently not only decided to attempt to channel the 30's monster films, but The Lion King as well.  The touching and tender moment which was probably supposed to illicit emotion definitely created a reaction in me  something akin to a stomach flu or acid reflux.  I've never seen `The Mummy' or `The Mummy Returns', so I can't compare it to his other work, but Van Helsing makes Stephen Sommers look worse than an amateur  he comes across as an amateur who thinks he knows what he's doing. In reality, what he's doing is ruining the promising career of good actors, Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxborough.  Rich.Hugh, seriously  leave this potential franchise and run towards the light.  Based on the ridiculous presentation of this film, the next one will have Van Helsing getting stuck in a cage match between the Easter Bunny and Snoopy  and we'll be encouraged to find it awe-inspiring because it will be from `The Director of The Mummy!' I can see the trailer now:  `Odie.  Peppermint Patty.  The Wicked Witch of the West.  All fear one man.' And hopefully we won't then be seeing Hugh Jackman look up from under his hat this time, but Corey Feldman.  This `film' will do nothing but waste your time.  If there was a grade lower than a `1' on the IMDB voting list, I would classify it as that instead of reluctantly giving it a positive number.  I wouldn't wish this thing on my worst enemy  I can't muster up enough hate to inflict this tripe. It wasn't long before I was jealous of the vampires' victims, because I wanted to be put out of my misery as easily. Van Helsing is nothing but a huge disappointment, and will only drain any strength of will or intelligence from you.  When the film ended, I was left completely defeated and struck dumb.  Drop the popcorn and slowly step away from the movie.--Shelly",Van Helsing
131,Libretio,"A tribute to CGI effects, but not much else",4,27 February 2005,"VAN HELSING Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS(Color & black and white)Under orders from a secret Vatican organization, monster-hunter Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) pursues Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) to his Transylvanian lair, where Jackman uncovers a fiendish plot to harness the electrical energy of Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley) to revive thousands of the vampire's dormant offspring.Having already plundered cinematic history for his recent monster outings (THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS), writer-director Stephen Sommers reassembled the remaining members of Universal's 'golden age' creatures for this bloated concoction, in which a bare-bones narrative is virtually swamped by an over-reliance on CGI effects. It certainly LOOKS spectacular: Allen Daviau's restless camera swoops and dives around Gothic sets which stretch into infinity, while nightmarish computer-generated creatures swirl across the screen with gravity-defying abandon, accompanied by a ceaseless blast of multichannel digital sound. Sommers is clearly respectful of his source material, but his best efforts are compromised by poor scriptwork, unlike Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" series (for example), which marries similar visual techniques to a strong plot line with subversive thematic undercurrents.There are two stand-out set-pieces: Dracula's brides (transformed into flying harpies) pursuing Jackman's carriage through a fog-bound forest along the edge of a yawning chasm; and the climactic duel between two Harryhausen-style monsters in the heart of Dracula's castle. Even better, Sommers breaks new ground in the depiction of CGI werewolves, portrayed here as ferocious, super-charged killing machines in some of the film's most frightening sequences (parents of young children take note). Jackman is as personable as ever, though he's barely stretched by the material, and he's given able support by gorgeous Kate Beckinsale (much better here than in the similarly-styled UNDERWORLD) as the native Transylvanian whose family has been decimated by Dracula's unwanted attentions, David Wenham as Van Helsing's travelling companion, and Hensley (buried under Greg Cannom's vivid makeup design) as Frankenstein's creation. Roxburgh's performance as Dracula alternates between camp affectation and genuine malevolence, and he's upstaged by Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran as his ultra-sexy vampire brides. Dancer-turned-actor Will Kemp plays Beckinsale's handsome werewolf brother, and there's a welcome cameo by Robbie Coltrane (Hagrid in the ""Harry Potter"" series) as the monstrous Mr. Hyde.All in all, VAN HELSING represents a step forward in terms of visual effects technology, but doesn't amount to very much as a movie.

Now, he takes some more of the most beloved suspense tales and turns them into a cheap, comic book like movie. None of them are given any kind of adequate screen time or development, they are simply there for name value. What ensues is one of the more ridiculous summer movies in recent memory, like Hudson Hawk, except not funny. There are even some painful James Bond references, such as a monk who gives Van Helsing state of the art weapons. I pity Richard Roxburgh who had to suffer through both The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and this. It's all pieced together from other franchises like some lumbering monster with obvious stitch work.",Van Helsing
135,jdkraus,Special effects versus storyline...uhm?,8,27 May 2004,"No doubt Stephen Sommers knows his special effects for his films. Usually, his stories don't seem to have a descent storyline. i honestly think The Mummy returns was a lame film, but i respect the effects, the cast, enjoy the action/humor. This film is not a disaster though as some or many may saw. It is three times better than The Alamo, which i rank on the top ten list of worst films of all time. here's the psitives and negatives. Positives: The visual effects the action sequences The idea of a story The actor Hugh Jackman the villain was a well actor too the grunt creatures, very cute the actor who played the goofy side-kick Negatives: the female vampires behavior (totally stupid) Some of the creatures (Frankenstein, total retard) The length of the movie The ending (hated it!)i still give this film a 7 out of 10. Watch out for pouncing werewolves, running grunts, and screeching vampires!",Van Helsing

Sommers almost pulled off the similar style he perfected with The Mummys box office success, but the everything storyline is too much. I saw this on release and my annoyance hasn't changed. It hasn't grown into the cult film I predicted and the Dracula performance is so over the top it borders unwatchable.

Its a ridiculous movie, as much homage as it's camp, but all the time action scenes dominate- Van Helsing is like a James Bond movie where he fights MGM classic monsters. It relies too heavily on CGI although in comparison to any of the Transformer movies, Van Helsing shows restraint. It's a stupid movie, cartoonish in both character development and plot, but as a whole miraculously works. The secret to what makes Van Helsing so watchable- the movie is of no significant moral or social value. I pray they make a sequel, Van Helsing 2 Dracula's Revenge!",Van Helsing
138,DarthVoorhees,Fun in a 'Batman & Robin' kind of way...,7,27 March 2016,"I'll be honest 'Van Helsing' is a hard movie to review. I totally see both ends of the spectrum. It can be a very fun movie when one looks at it's corny audacity and monster set pieces. And yet it's just too much to ask for a whole hearted straight faced recommendation because that dialogue... I kind of hate and love this movie for a lot of different reasons some of which conflict with one another. In the end I can't quite condemn it because it's too much stupid fun.There is no getting around the fact that it has one of the stupidest half-assed written scripts for any huge summer blockbuster. There are moments in this movie where Stephen Sommers writes himself into traps and a vampire will pop literally out of nowhere because he has no idea of anything else to do. My all time personal favorite moment is when he has no idea how to get our heroes to Dracula's castle so a painting suddenly becomes a portal. The characters are so shallow that whenever Sommers tries to squeeze in some personality or motivation it becomes jarring and hilarious. The Transylvanian Princess Anna remarks that she has never been to the sea as they explore Frankenstein's ruins. It's ineptness reaches a climax in the big finale when Hugh Jackman doesn't actually fight Dracula. He turns into appalling CGI werewolf. I felt kind of ripped off. It's bad screen writing 101.And yet as far as stupid movies go this one is kind of entertaining in that it so sincerely believes it's smart. Hugh Jackman is the reason 'Van Helsing' retains just enough serious to laugh with and not at the film. If Sommers had Brendan Fraiser again this movie would have been a disaster. Jackman is perfect here. He is entertaining and adds the right amount and right kind of humor to his performance. I don't know. All my criticism and smiles come down to me being a huge Universal Monster fan. This movie loves the iconography of the monsters. You definitely see where the money went on this thing. The sets and make-up effects are all spectacular. The cobwebs, the Transylvanian villages, the laboratory. I can't help but smile at it. The opening ten minutes alone are worth the price of admission. The movie only truly gets boring when it is loaded with CGI....and yet on the other hand I can't help but be a little angry that Universal thinks this and 'Dracula Untold' is how to honor their monster heritage. Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Lon Chaney Jr never played characters as superficial as these in any of the Universal classics. Everything is at face value here. The iconography? Beautiful. The mythology? They don't have a clue as to what made these characters appeal to monster fans. I understand the hate this movie gets but I think it's far too stupid to devote any passionate loathing to. I loved it as a kid when it first came out and looking back at it I can still sort of see why I did. It's goofy and has fun being goofy. It's a 'Batman & Robin' caliber watch. You'll be entertained I think if you sort of smirk at it.",Van Helsing
139,tomimt,Intentionally campy and ridiculous,6,20 December 2008,"If someone would ask me to define a comic book movie, I'd show them Van Helsing, as that really is how the film plays out: a comic book from from pre-WW2 era.Van Helsing is a silly, emphasis on the word silly here, yarn about vampire hunter named, well, Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), who surprisingly enough has lost his memory. He's aided by the Vatican and its secret stash of monks, who do nothing else than make weapons for killing the forces of dark. Van Helsing is assigned to go after Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and a young monk Carl (David Wenham) is ordered to go with him as a tech support. In Transylvania he gets help from Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), of whom family the Dracula has wowed to kill off, and surprisingly enough the creature (Shuler Hensley) that Frankenstein made.This all leads to sights and action that makes no sense in any level with the exception of entertainment value. And that really is how the film should be seen: nonsensical piece of pulp entertainment. If you start to expect some real values form it, like sense or plot or good dialog, you are certainly watching a wrong film. But it you don't mind a highly illogical film, that causes you to chuckle for its own silliness, well, you just might enjoy this ride.This film, I thought, did far better in its genre than some other films, like Sky Captain. Van Helsing is certainly worth a one look.",Van Helsing
140,Darkside-Reviewer,An under appreciated movie,7,8 March 2019,I watched this film in cinema when it was first released. I enjoyed it but it wasn't until ten years later when I rewatched it that I thought this is a good Vampire Movie for the time it was made and is very action oriented unlike most vampire movies which are usually slow burners. This movie changed the pace for once and gave the action it promised I would recommend watching this movie to anyone who enjoys Monster movies heavy on the action and low on the dialogue. Sometimes it's nice to watch a movie and not think for a while so enjoy.,Van Helsing
141,gigan-92,A Must For Fans of Classic Monsters and Modern Audiences Alike,7,26 June 2009,"Stephen Sommers once again takes a classic horror film refurbishes it into a modern action flick. I find it a very well made film actually. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale star in the lead roles and they both portray their characters excellently. Van Helsing had always been an interesting character to me, seeing as he's been in nearly every film Dracula has (besides ""Blade: Trinity""). I was wondering when they were finally going to make a movie of about him. Finally, the day came. Jackman is perfect for the role. Also starring is David Wenham, who provides a lot of the comic relief in the film. This film too me wouldn't be what it is without his comedic elements, seriously. The visual effects are incredible, especially with the werewolf transformation scenes, astonishingly real. The end fight between the Hugh Jackman Werewolf and Dracula is by far my favorite scene in the film. The CGI, lighting, and brutality of the fight all come together excellently here. The story was incredibly well done by my standards, including elements from several of the classic monster movies, even ""Dr. Jackal and Mr. Hyde"". The only one Sommers did leave out was ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"". At the same time don't expect a true classic like those films, but merely an action movie of Sommers material.The action is adrenaline pumping and impressive, although the carriage scene is at times a bit over the top. The only other things that bug me is one, that ball room scene is never really explained. So were those all of Dracula's victims from over time, as I'm guessing, or what? Plus, how does one of those egg pod thing things even fit out of a bride's V-JJ, or in her womb as apparently, according to Frankenstein, they have several in one birthing. And they constantly hint to how Van Helsing got this amnesia, as if there is to be sequel or something, very distracting at times. Getting off those subjects, the music by Alan Silvestri is very well done and fits the film perfectly. The music at the climactic battle is one of the best pieces he's done in a while, especially as Van Helsing realizes the horror of the things he's done ( if you don't know what I'm talking about, see the film). Excellent SFX and action, but many a plot hole, ""Van Helsing"" is still quite the fun film.",Van Helsing

143,WriterDave,"Jane Austen's ""Destroy All Monsters!""",2,22 October 2005,"This film is a brilliant and psychologically complex treatise on Victorian era social mores as seen through the eyes of Van Helsing, a rapscallion character who overcomes his impoverished beginnings to climb the social ladder and eventually reach the pinnacle of high society. It's his cockeyed optimism that allows him to go from rags to riches with an almost Dickensian charm, but in classic irony normally suited for Shakespearan tragedy it is also that very trait the leads him on a path to danger and horror. There's also brilliant social satire as seen through the colorful characters from Transylvania, who bring both shock and scathing black humor in their representation of the nomadic, exotic outsiders than so many proper Victorians feared would infiltrate and poison their gilded society.Just kidding, of course. ""Van Helsing"" is wall to wall special effects and hammy acting dancing across poorly lit set designs. Classic movie buffs are turned off in the first few minutes with the over-the-top alleged ""homage"" to the black and white Universal horror flicks. The plot is arbitrary and pointless, though with so much going on and Kate Beckinsale in tight corsets, I suppose this does have some entertainment value for ten year-old boys. I watched this one rainy Saturday afternoon and left twice to clean my bathroom and mop my kitchen floor, and I didn't miss a thing.",Van Helsing
144,Mr_Sensitive,It Delivered What It Said To Deliver...A Really Good Action Sequences,7,11 September 2006,"What drawn me to this movie is the idea of the movie, which is so imaginative especially the three story intertwine into one. I also am expecting a good action sequence just like Stephen did with The Mummy. And the outcome is more or less --- satisfying.Brief: Prof. Van Helsing, the vampire hunter was send to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula from his evil plan of taking over the world.Yeah the story is what I like and the style of the movie is just perfect. My problem is that this movie got a really weird dialogs and worst the accent of each characters have, it is so hard to understand specially Count Dracula that sound like an Indian guy. The used of Hugh and Kate is a smart move and it work out really well. What I like most of the movie is the detail they have put into the large Set and CGI and wardrobe and make up. All that has been done brilliantly. Though the acting is nothing special.The best part of the movie is what I was hoping to see  loads and loads of action scene, and they did deliver it and it is extremely fun to watch.Final Words: Excellent action sequences, though do expect an unexpected ending (but not the good one).Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B-)Thanks For Reading",Van Helsing

The movie is exciting and has thrills and chills, as well as eye-catching visual effects.  The classic movie monsters are re-imagined here, but not spoofed.

146,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: Good acting, silly action",4,12 May 2004,"I love action films and I don't need a lot of drama -- Jackie Chan and Arnold Schwartzenegger are fine. But I like the action to be clever, with some plot twists and powerful tension. Not in this film. Van Helsing has some strong acting by Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxburgh, but it's just tremendously silly. Sort of like ""The Mummy"", where someone shouts ""Place the amulet into the magic box and make the secret cross and spinkle some sand over the tomb quick before the pharaoh ghost of the hell people blinks twice before midnight!"" Yadda yadda yadda.A lot of films get caught up in this trap. Rather than making a dramatic impact with a rich personal story (something that Hellboy attempts, but fails)... they try to shock us with a lot of monsters. But there are so many of them and different types and exceptions and silver crosses work on some but not others... it all melts down into so much uninteresting bother. Where's the dramatic tension if the plot is too silly to be believed?There is a touch of bona fide action in the movie but a lot of it is hammed up as well. You know, conveniently placed ropes for swinging. There is a lot of swinging in the film. Apparently if you grab someone at the end of a 10 story fall the instant deceleration doesn't kill them. Huh. What do you know.I did feel the visual flying effects worked better than Spiderman (which just left me dizzy and disoriented). Kate Beckinsale isn't given much of a role, and she does nothing with it. I didn't see any chemistry, romantic or otherwise.Who should see this film:-- Hugh Jackson fans, but only on a rainy day.-- Tall guys whose heads blink but they're really good, not evilI nearly gave Van Helsing a 5 out of 10 but those silly Eastern European accents... argh...

Before introducing all the other ""characters"" conveniently and with the same odorless momentum. The ending is the big ass fight between the 2 big dudes, and they lived happily ever after with money in their pockets, a moment of fame, and a dreadful, shitty film. Yup, that bad ! Two out of ten.

Stephen Sommers, director of ""The Mummy"", brings a new set of rules and updates to his creatures and makes Van Helsing an awesome, well-equipped action hero. So let's spread our wings, charge up, and take a bite into this action-packed creature feature.Plot: Dracula, the Prince of Darkness, had Dr. Frankenstein create his monster for a nefarious purpose, but the vampire lord loses both the good doctor and his creation. A year later, having finished business in Paris (Mr. Hyde), monster hunter Van Helsing, alongside his genius sidekick Carl, is sent by the Knights of the Holy Order to Transylvania to kill Dracula while protecting Princess Anna from him. However, Dracula has three brides, a werewolf, and other creatures under his control. With the help of Carl, Anna, and Frankenstein's monster, Van Helsing sets out to stop this monster madness with an arsenal of crazy weapons and an attitude to match.This is a great tribute to the classic monster movies. Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster have great updates, cool designs, and unique twists to their characters. Van Helsing is tough as nails and Anna is both sexy and strong. Both characters do have soft spots, especially for each other. Carl, along with many other things in this movie, is pretty darn funny. It's great the way all these characters are tied together in this crazy battle for the fate of the world.With a complex story, nice effects, fun music, good comedy, and awesome action scenes, this movie is sure to please.

If it is possible in an action movie (because that is what this is) there is too much action-it is exhausting to watch. The physical feats that the main characters perform are impossible and inventive if a little ridiculous. David Wenham has fun with his part as does Jackman and Beckinsale but I bet they were glad when it was over-though Kate has done similar roles since. CGI is fine, if used economically, but it is all over this and detracts from the visual rather than enhancing it as it is easily spotted.

Blah, you've seen practically everything this movie has to offer in other, better movies and after the LOTR trilogy this one looks pretty cheap. A budget of 160mill wasted on bad, over used and recycled special effects, ""Van Helsing"" thinks that CGI redeems all its other flaws. That theoretically might have been the case had these effects been better and used much much wiser that they actually are-by the gallon! There's so much of this that it gets tedious after the first half hour, and that's 2 hours more to go! Absolutely nothing positive comes to my mind after seeing this crap (apart from the side-kick Carl, some genuinely sarcastic and funny moments and the actor playing Dracula-he looks like he's really enjoying himself and does impressive work with his script) The two main protagonists are not even worth mentioning, Hugh just does his job and Kate plays a stereotypical Romanian-accented woman.Bad bad bad, I would enjoy it immensely bashing it some more but I have better things to doRecommendations: a perfect movie for study breaks.

155,domino1003,For True Universal Monster Buffs Only,6,3 August 2005,"""Van Helsing"" uses a lot of old Universal Monster film bits in the film and the film will appeal more to those who may appreciate the genre. However, the film is mostly a CGI fest, with a plot that can be considered laughable at best.Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman)works for the Vatican to rid the world of monsters. Van Helsing is also considered a murderer as well by outsiders. Van Helsing is also a bit of a mystery: He has been alive and around for hundreds of years, and has no clue to who he really is (or was). The Vatican has a mission for him: To go to Transylvania to stop Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh)from conducting experiments in which a vast amount of his ""children"" would be brought to life (He and his 3 brides are dead, so none of their children can live without some help). To do this, he needs Frankenstein's monster (Shuler Hensley)to achieve his task.Van Helsing, despite his skills, needs some help. He gets this in the form of Carl (David Wenham) a friar who works with the Vatican and provides the weapons, and Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), who comes from a long line of monster hunters who cannot enter heaven unless Dracula is destroyed, and whose brother Velkan (Will Kemp)has become a werewolf.The film has long stretches which can bore you to tears. I'm not saying it's completely bad, it's just that the film has a lot of wasted potential. You see parts of a good old fashion monster mash on the screen and wish that it could have been better.If you grew up with the Universal Horror Classics (Especially when they would put the creatures together in films like ""House of Dracula"" or any of the ""Abbott and Costello"" monster films), then this may remind you of days long gone.

156,SkullScreamerReturns,"Noisy ""tribute"" to Universal classic monster movies",4,25 September 2021,"I saw this movie when it was quite new and somewhat liked it. Now I watched it again after a long time and...was bored and annoyed. I guess the sheer idea of the characters of Van Helsing and Dracula among other monsters being in a movie was enough to get me excited when I was younger, but that didn't work anymore.The good: 1) Hugh Jackman is cool in the title role. 2) The set pieces are well done and the outdoor scenery is beautiful and very gothic.The bad and the rest: First of all the tone of the movie. It's very noisy and somehow comedic, but not enough to be actually funny. Especially Dracula and his vampire brides are over-acted and cheesy. It seems the makers attempted some kind of ironic style to make fun of the usual oh-so-serious gothic clichés but it doesn't work for me. (And in the end I felt like the story fell victim into the same kind of cliche's it tries to laugh at.) I wish the movie was more serious, atmospheric, darker, and the pace a bit slower instead of the non-stop chaotic noisy action. Well, I guess that would be an entirely different movie then! The director Stephen Sommers is also known from his Mummy movies starring Brendan Fraser. There is a bit similar vibe to it here, though the Mummy probably managed a bit better at being funny.The cgi monsters were pretty bad, but that's what you get from early 2000s. I also didn't like Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) at all. He doesn't feel like Dracula at all, more like some cheap rock star vampire from a bad Anne Rice adaptation.There is some coolness in this movie but to me it was a tiresome watch.

I mean, Hugh Jackman in that funky long hat and floppy hat... chucking those nasty boomerang blades at bad guys? And taking on not only Dracula and the Frankenstein monster... but the Wolf Man, too? Shoulda been a winner! Unfortunately the movie went wrong in sooooooooo many ways. I mean, it's not a total drag but it definitely has too many strikes against it. First problem: wayyyyyyyyyyy too much reliance on CGI. When are the techno geeks making these movies going to get it thru their heads... CGI still looks FAKE! If you use it sparingly you can trick audiences into believing that they are seeing something impossible happen... but when its just effect after effect after effect... well, we might as well be watching someone playing a video game. Second problem: bad acting. Jackman is alright as Van Helsing... and that one blond chick with the weird accent was kinda fun... but Kate Beckinsale as the butt-kickin' gypsy wench was just embarrassing. Ditto for the dude playing Dracula. And I really could have done without the characters speaking in modern vernacular. Vampires exclaiming, ""Too bad, so sad""??? Puh-leeeeeeeease! Third problem: this goes back to the CGI thing... there was too much reliance on mindless action for action's sake... the characters needed some more dialogue! Maybe a few scenes to make us care about these characters (so that the small tragedy at the end might have actually *meant* something)? So, do yourself a favor and forget about this bizarre attempt at combining James Bond with Hammer Films... and go see ""Captain Kronos: Vampire Hunter"" which is 10 times the movie this is.",Van Helsing
158,supertom-3,OTT!!!,5,1 November 2004,"Stephan Sommers, responsible for the simplistic, high action, low plot, and mildly diverting Mummy series, continues his love of the B-movie and monster movie with this CGI laden action fest. Van Helsing is about the legendary mythical Vampire Hunter and Sommer's not only pits him against Vampire, but Werewolves, Harpies, Frankenstein's monster and Dr Jekyll and his alter ego, Mr Hyde. Already you can tell that this film is all about the action.This is a mildly diverting and occasionally spectacular movie but at the end of the day it's forgettable and hollow, despite the superb Jackman. Hugh Jackman plays the titular hero and as he was in X Men and Swordfish, he makes an engaging and charismatic action hero, thanks to that extra bit of acting ability that traditional action stars don't usually have. Co-Starring is the sex-tastic Kake Beckinsdale who is ravishingly good as Van Helsings not so damsel in distress, love interest. The problem with this film is that despite being huge in scale, it just doesn't engage the audience. It's almost too big for it's boots and lacks the wit and rollicking enjoyment value of The Mummy. There are too many elements, It's like adding more spices than you need to a perfectly good curry and ruining the flavour. Whereas as The Mummy was a nicely spiced Chicken Jalfrezi, this is a Prawn, Chicken, Lamb and Beef, Tikka-Massalla-Bhoona-Dhansak (I know my curries!). Something full of elements that should work, but in the end don't. Sommers loses grip and in the end seems to be at the computer screen whacking off in delight at all the techno wizardry before him and as such we get over the top action sequences, CGI crane shots and just too much sugar coating for something that was far to sweetened to begin with. It's teeth rotting stuff this and you'll leave with a stomach ache for sure. That's enough of the food analogies, I'm getting hungry but basically this really is an excessive and ultimately wasteful exercise in making a movie purely for the box office receipts. This has its moments but is a waste of a talented cast, with Jackman in particular not given enough to do. **",Van Helsing
159,jetkot,Stylish but Cartoonish . Not deep,7,24 April 2019,This is an action adventure horror thriller. Van Helsing is the stylish vampire hunter. Hugh Jackman has very little to do here apart from looking good and saying one-liners. The movie has too much action and a very loud background score. The background score and the yells from the demonic characters get irritating after the point. It does not scare you and the CGI looked very cartoonish to me. It did not look real at all. It did not convince me to believe in the storyline and I kept watching a CGI led action fest on screen and got bored terribly towards the end. I was waiting for the movie to get over,Van Helsing
160,christian123,An Action Packed Movie,4,25 November 2004,"Hugh Jackman trades his razor sharp claws for razor sharp blades to play the monster-hunter, Gabriel Van Helsing, hired by the church to go to Transylvania to take on Count Dracula {Richard Roxburgh}, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster.The premise sounds very interesting and this film had potential to be a good summer blockbuster. Unfortunately, the film is very uneven. The CGI is great and the movie gets an ""A"" on that part but the rest of the film was handled very poorly. Apparently, Stephen Sommers took some lessons from George Lucas and decided to fill his movie with just CGI. This isn't a bad thing since it is a summer movie. However, the film becomes very dull and the story is kind of weak. Don't get me wrong, I love the concept but the execution just wasn't very good. Sure, the monsters looked great but I was expecting a little more than that.The acting was okay, nothing special. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing well and he does make for a good hero. Kate Beckinsale was weak and very cheesy as Anna. I know the movie is supposed to be cheesy but she was a little too much. Her chemistry with Jackman was also non existent and this hurt the film. Richard Roxburgh gives the best performance out of everyone. He plays Dracula and he is very effective as the villain.A big problem with Van Helsing is the length of the movie. 132 minutes is just too long and it made the film very dull to sit through. The film was also too cheesy for me. Some of it was just so stupid and the story grew more and more ridiculous as the film continued. The first hour is actually pretty good and entertaining. The second hour is dull and not as creative as the first part. The ending was alright, nothing really special. Honestly, the main reason to watch this film is because of the combination of Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein in one movie. The story is weak, the acting is nothing special and the direction is poor. The film is very stylish though so the 160 million went to good use. Besides for these flaws, Van Helsing was still a decent summer blockbuster with some fun moments. In the end, now that it's out on video, Van Helsing is worth a look just don't expect too much from it. Rating 6/10",Van Helsing
161,Prof-Hieronymos-Grost,A horrifying abomination,2,29 September 2008,"Count Dracula is out to steal Dr Frankenstein's formula for reanimating living beings and also to take the key to this work, The Monster himself, his reason is to give life to thousands of Vampire babies he has spawned with his three wives, that are cocooned up in his Transylvaniaian cellar. Meanwhile across town Van Helsing is a masked crusader that fights evil and creatures of the night at the behest of a secret papal organisation. We meet up with him first as he tries to capture a demented Mr Hyde who is hiding out in Notre Dame cathedral, after disposing of his foe, he is sent on a mission to stop this Dracula character from completing his evil plans. Universal has a wonderful colourful history of Horror and creature films, here yet again Sommers, the man responsible for The Mummy films, continues to plunder their archives for the best of their characters and this time throws them all in to a Horror hotch potch of a film and hopes that they all gel..They don't!. Where can one begin? This film is a CGI abomination where nothing looks real, it's a bastardisation of wonderful childhood memories that I treasure, the characters are given new personas, for what reason I don't know? Other than to cash in on an already successful franchise, Sommers could have tried to bring new monsters to the screen, but instead he alters the very facets of the ones we love with an arrogant disregard. Van Helsing is now a James Bond like character, who has his very own team of experts who spend their days, making ridiculous contraptions and gadgets to help him rid the world of evil. Jackman sleepwalks though the film, Beckinsale looks hot but has little else to offer, Roxburgh hams it up aplenty as old Drac, but again fails to capture the character. For 0.99 I thought I had a bargain, despite its much heralded flaws, the fact is I was robbed of not only the paltry financial amount but more importantly 2 hours of my life.",Van Helsing
162,squeezebox,A Spit in the Face to all Classic Monster Fans,2,11 May 2004,"There are three things I liked about VAN HELSING: the first ten minutes, Kate Beckinsale's ass, and... actually, those two are it, unless you count each butt cheek separately.What is with Hollywood? Why are they incapable of making action or horror movies of anything remotely resembling quality? Why do they feel that a couple of ""popular-this-month"" stars and overuse of lousy CGI effects make a movie? The fact that this movie is doing as well as it is just tells me that general American audiences are morons.The director of this abominable piece of crap deserves to be drawn and quartered. I have never seen a movie that set up so many potentially great scenes, then proceeded to do nothing with them. You've got a movie featuring Dracula, The Wolf Man and the Frankenstein monster, and the monsters never fight? Frankenstein's monster gets to beat up a female vampire in an all-too brief scene, Dracula and Van Helsing-turned-werewolf also duke it out in a mind-numbingly dull CGI-laden battle that looks like a video game. And why does Dracula have to turn into a giant bat monster to fight a werewolf. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to juxtapose Dracula in his human form duking it out with a hulking werewolf? Sure it would, which, I guess, is why they didn't do it. They're not interested in pleasing monster movie fans. They're interested in holding the attention of video game-jaded pre-teenagers. ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN had more effective action in it.The beginning of the movie is great. Shot in beautiful black and white (which contemporary audiences are far too stupid to appreciate), it plays like a loving tribute to the classic Universal monster movies. However, it comes off like a mean joke to everyone who actually believed the filmmakers who swore this movie was in the spirit of the Universal and Hammer monster movies, when it suddenly turns into your typical post-MATRIX pseudo-goth action flick.Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are both incredibly dull. Other than Beckinsale's aforementioned buns, which look great in her tight pants (which I'm sure were all the rage in early 1800s Europe), she is as boring a character as I can recall having seen in a movie. The screenplay is so awful, though, it's hard to blame it all on the actors. Van Helsing's sidekick, supposedly there for comic relief, is one of the screen's most hideously obnoxious characters in many years.It's two hours of throwing glitzy hubbub at you to trick you into thinking something is happening, and about five too many scenes of people swinging through the air on wires. This movie sucks. I can remember, in my lifetime, when Hollywood had balls. It wasn't afraid to offend. It wasn't so obsessed with making money as to forsake making a good movie in the process. VAN HELSING is a good example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood. Too much money, too overblown, hokey humor, targeting the general demographic rather than the true fan, sacrificing intelligence in favor of spectacle. The filmmakers' contempt for their audience is worn on their sleeve.And who thought Mr. Hyde should look like Shrek?",Van Helsing

During the late 19th Century Van Helsing heads to the Eastern Europe otherwise known as Transylvania to battle Count Dracula (Roxburgh), Frankenstein and Wolf Man. Van Helsing meets Anna Valerious who happens to be a princess of a royal family and her parents were killed and all there was left was her and her brother. This movie kept shocking me out of my seat every time when there was a scary part coming up and you don't know what is going to strike! I thought some of the weapons the Van Helsing used were pretty cool like this one weapon that is a crossbow but it can shoot arrows like a machine gun!SPOILER WARNING: Van Helsing gets bitten by a werewolf and then he turns into a werewolf while he is fighting Dracula in the final battle!Another thing is that I thought Josie Maran was very sexy as a vampire when she was a vampire bat she didn't look good then but when she was back into a vampire she looked sexy. I also thought Hugh Jackman did a great job at Van Helsing because he plays a lot of good main role characters and I thought he was also good in the X-Men movies doing Wolverine! Also, can you believe that Kate Beckinsale was doing this movie while she was filming Underworld at the same time? I know I can't especially with having to be playing a vampire hunter in one movie and then switching to a human character in the other.BOTTOM LINE: HUGH JACKMAN HAS DONE ANOTHER GREAT ROLE AGAIN!",Van Helsing
164,Trevor-Kerensky,"Not bad, but not the best of the action horror flicks",7,3 July 2018,"I had such anticipation for this film, having heard it was going to be directed by the guy who gave us The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. More of the classic Universal monsters in one film. Frankenstein, the werewolves, and Dracula. And Hugh Jackman as the monster slayer. Plus lots of Eastern European sets. It may not be an Oscar contender but it did its job as a popcorn film that could entertain those who don't want to think hard. It's also good for those of you who didn't care for the Mummy due to the casting of Brendan Fraser as the main character. Even though I did enjoy Van Helsing, I hoped that there'd be a better plot. But it's good as a popcorn film, as previously stated. If you liked the classic Universal monsters and want action, or if you're following Stephen Sommers, give this a go. If you expected something deep or intellectual, no deal.",Van Helsing
165,PeterRoeder,Every horror fan's dream come true!,7,6 May 2004,"Don't believe the bad reviews of this film. It is excellent. It has all the right material and it really does well with it. In the end it all works out. The CGI are probably the best I have seen in any movie. The Van Helsinger character is everything the Batman movie should have been. He is The Dark Knight par excellence. He is the Indiana Jones of the 19th century. This movie is about as good as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and far better than the other Indiana Jones movies. It is really great to see Dracula, Dr.Frankenstein, Frankenstein's monster, the Wolfman and Dr. Jekyll and Mr.Hyde in one movie. It is like an edition of ""Leauge of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" with a special eye for horror. Maybe the action becomes a bit too much sometimes but the young Van Helsing is an action character as opposed to the older who is more scientifically minded. Anyway, the bad reviews are given by people who don't appreciate horror. Don't believe it. This is the dream of every horror fan.",Van Helsing

I'm secure in my masculinity and all, but it's a sad state of affairs when I'm sitting there less than 45 minutes into it, thinking, ""Holy crap, these costumes are AWFUL.""Which, y'know, they ARE... sorry dude, that gigantic hat make you look like a mushroom.  And don't decorate the front of the Hot Female Lead's corset with little red circular designs... they tend to look like something else.It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but for the money they spent on it, the producers will burn even lower in Hell than the people who greenlit ""From Justin to Kelly.""  Stephen Sommers had a good start with ""The Mummy,"" but now just covers his lazy butt with as much CGI as humanly possible. And that is the single laziest thing a filmmaker can do.  Knock it off.",Van Helsing
167,mnpollio,Sounds promising on paper; far less so in execution,4,12 October 2014,"Director Stephen Sommers was fresh off the success of The Mummy films, when he apparently had the inspiration to start a new franchise centering on the legendary Van Helsing character. Fanboys everywhere began imagining what older actor would take the part. The announcement then came that hunky Hugh Jackman would play the role of a younger Van Helsing, who would not just hunt vampires but a variety of monsters from the Universal stable. Enthusiasm was through the roof...then the film came out and the end result was like air being let out of a balloon.Jackman does indeed play Van Helsing, who is an assassin on behalf of the Vatican crossing the globe offing monsters. The film opens with him taking down Mr. Hyde and running afoul of the law. Then he is dispatched to Transylvania to deal with Dracula and his brides that are trying to procreate. This all has something to with Frankenstein's Monster and a werewolf, but if you can figure out how then you are doing better than I am.The film boasts a strong cast who are often not given anything of worth to do, an array of special effects, and a frenetic pace that will hopefully distract from the fact that the story is an overstuffed mess. The film would have been far more better to have focused on one or two monsters instead of the bunch we have here. We get Dracula and his three brides, Frankenstein, the Wolf Man, Mr. Hyde and a villainous Igor (badly played by Kevin O'Connor). Frankenstein is never adequately worked into the plot and the Wolf Man seems an afterthought. Along with these characters, the film also must make room for Kate Beckinsale's sexy tough-as-nails gypsy co-hort and David Wenham as a dorky friar aiding our hero. It is just too much.It also does not help that the film comes across like a wall of noise. There is never much sense or fun or charm to anything we see. The non-stop visual effects are a real mixed bag. The effects involving Dracula and his brides are fine, but Mr Hyde looks like a cross between Gumby and The Hulk and the werewolf effects are embarrassing. Why is it that 30 years ago we were getting state-of-the-art werewolf effects in The Howling and An American Werewolf in London, but these latest CGI werewolf effects look like crap? Also, the plot never makes it clear why the Vatican forces Van Helsing to work on the wrong side of the law when writs from them would instantaneously give him the cache to do whatever need be done.Of the cast, Will Kemp as the werewolf and Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein may as well not be in it for all of the focus they get. Roxburgh does little but snarl as Dracula. Wenham has some amusing moments and Beckinsale has never been sexier.I am a huge Hugh Jackman fan. I have had the privilege to see him in films, on stage and in person, and the man oozes personality and charisma from every pore. In Van Helsing, he is completely underwhelming. He has been handed a role that could have been filled by a stunt man without noticing a difference. Van Helsing as written has no character traits, no humor, no charisma, no history and no presence. He stands unsmiling, with a variety of weapons, and grunts or recites lines in a one-note grizzled tough guy voice. The actor that humanized Wolverine and became a star with X-Men is apparently on vacation here. He does get to do a lot of running, jumping, climbing, falling and swinging. He dons a loincloth in one scene, but alas no nudity to compensate for the absence of anything else.Much could be forgiven if the film was dumb fun (like The Mummy), but it is not. It is loud, annoying, incoherent, squanders a great leading man and promising supporting cast, contains dreadful werewolf effects and ultimately is little more than a big waste of time.",Van Helsing
168,ThrownMuse,a roller-coaster ride in the worst way possible,3,15 December 2004,"Van Helsing enlists a Transylvanian beauty to battle Dracula. Complicating things are the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster. This ""summer blockbuster"" looks more like a prototype for a thrill ride than a movie. It features some of the worst dialogue I have ever had the displeasure of hearing. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale have proved in ""X-Men"" and ""Underworld"" that they can carry action films but they both fail miserably here. I'm not typically against CGI, but I felt like I was watching a cartoon! I did like that Dracula's Brides had a large role in this, and as CGI flying vampires, they were somewhat creepy. This would have been more exciting as a 3-D attraction at Universal Studios or an arcade game. My Rating: 3/10",Van Helsing
169,flicklover,Where's the story?,7,9 May 2004,"When every May comes, we all know that the Summer Blockbuster season starts. This year it begins with this latest action extravaganza. Unfortunately, this film embodies what the summer blockbuster has become. A soulless exercise in high budget frenziness. The movie looks great, the effects are mostly top of the line, but it lacks what I believe is essential to a good adventure movie, characters and a story that the audience cares about. This movie has some impressive action sequenses, but they are not as exhilerating as they should be. The pacing is breakneck, but the movie never stops to even give us 5 minutes to develop any semblance story or character. Hugh Jackman plays Van Helsing, a monster killer, as we all know the arch nemesis of Dracula, in this movie we get wherwolves and Frankenstein's monster for good measure. The story is as cheesy as you get, Dracula wants to use Frankenstein to bring thousands of his offspring to life. Even a cheesy story can be involving;not this time. The action is well done, no expense has been spared to created it, but the movie has no heart.Crade: C",Van Helsing

I generally find myself disagreeing with the professional critics but in this case I couldn't agree more. In the middle of the film it seemed like a torture to continue watching. There was no solid plot, the screenplay is as crampy as possible, the CGI effects were laughable and I don't know, this movie has the most annoying Count Dracula ever portrayed in film. Hugh Jackman portrays the lead character with some kind of ""Helsing... Van Helsing"" style with Bond-like gadgets (wow, he also has a Q). Kate Beckinsale fitted much better into a vampire role (Selena) than this vampire-killer stuff. In all, it was a very very disappointing film.",Van Helsing

Granted the movie runs too long and the ending is not really satisfactory.  The movie does move very fast and Hugh Jackman is great as the title role.  I also like Kate Beckinsale as a princess that helps him. The villains are also quite good.  However, if you have Dracula, The Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's monster in the same movie, what are you going to do for a sequel?  I suppose it doesn't matter.  I suggest you go see this movie and ignore what the critics are saying. I give it a 7/10 with a big grin on my face.  Just see this movie and decide for yourselves.

172,ApolloBoy109,Poorly written Euro Trash by a Bad director,4,26 October 2004,"Directed/Writer Stephen Sommers single-handedly destroys the established myths of the universal monsters.I will never watch another movie by him again.If you can't (as a fan) do justice to the trilogy of horror history, you are pathetic. Stephen Sommers is pathetic.Too much CGI. Too much action. Too loud. Too stupid.The biggest insult: The werewolf doesn't know he could have killed Dracula all along? Wasn't that obvious to everyone in the first five minutes of the film.The worst rendition of Dracula EVER: A sissy Dracula? who dances and struts with a pony tail and a barrette? I don't want my Dracula fey!!What was with Anna? She starts with this preposterous Romanian accent and LOSES it half way through the movie.PLOT? What plot? We're suppose to believe the three brides gave birth to thousands of mutant bats in sacks!!!????And now Sissy Drac needs the Frankenstein monster to animate them?? Loved the American accent on Frankenstein. What the hell!!Soooo -- Van Helsing works for the catholics? In an underground Church, with monks and priests designing James Bond weapons? And he's an angel (which was never fully explained to my satisfaction) an angel who will father Abraham Van Helsing? What??!!If any other studio had produced this -- I would have waved my hand and skipped the movie. Shame on you Universal!How many times did these poor heroes have to get knocked down, thrown around before anyone developed more than a dab of blood on the corner of their mouths. Why turn Van Helsing into a werewolf to kill Dracula when you already had a werewolf character who is related to Dracula? Shouldn't Anna's brother kill the vampire.And what is this crap that no one knows how to kill a VAMPIRE. SINCE WHEN!!Sommer's wasn't paying homage to these great characters, he thinks so high and mighty of himself that he wanted to create his own version, which sucked. DIDN'T ANYONE watch him, didn't anyone CARE for the preservation of HISTORY. Have we raised this generation to buy into what we are told to buy into?

173,anhedonia,"It's all about the special effects, nothing else",5,9 May 2004,"""Van Helsing"" opens with a highly entertaining black-and-white homage to the old Universal horror films. It's gloriously tongue-in-cheek, but, alas, only a tease, because the rest of the film fails to live up to the promise. The joy lasts only about six minutes or so. After that, the film turns into a noisy, boisterous, occasionally fun, special effects extravaganza.This is a monster film where none of the monsters is scary. In fact, there isn't a frightening or suspenseful moment anywhere in this film. Just a couple of standard shocks, that's all. Then again, these monsters - Dracula, The Wolf Man and the Frankenstein Monster - quit being scary long ago. Every time I saw the Frankenstein Monster in ""Van Helsing,"" my mind flashed back to Peter Boyle getting his finger lit on fire by Gene Hackman in ""Young Frankenstein."" If only ""Van Helsing"" had even an ounce of the humor of that classic. Director Sommers keeps things moving at a frenetic pace, from one action sequence to another. But the dialogue is awful and he really cares little about his characters. Instead, he seems captivated by the visual effects and, frankly, they can only take a movie so far. The vampire babies, which look more like gargoyles than bats, seem to be an amalgam of ""Aliens"" and ""Gremlins."" The brides are fun, but they're certainly not as sexy or titillating as the three in Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" Granted, there's a gleefully campy sense to Richard Roxburgh's Dracula,
Sommers treats his story too seriously. This film should be played with tongue firmly planted in cheek. But, unfortunately, due to some truly bad dialogue, I found myself laughing when, I am certain, Sommers did not plan on eliciting laughs. There are some well-placed bits of humor - most of them courtesy of David Wenham. The good: a) Wenham providing delightful comic relief, proving how much better this film could have been had it adopted a lighter touch; b) Kate Beckinsale, her laughable accent notwithstanding, looking terrific in a bodice and knee-high boots; and c) Someone finally coming up with a line of dialogue to take care of the cinematic convention of the talking killer. And there's one funny throw-away line from an extra when Wenham sets off a tiny explosion in his lab.One huge problem is Alan Silvestri's headache-inducing musical score. Sommers cranks up the volume so loud that the score not only becomes a distraction, it's awfully annoying, too. The film runs about 25 minutes too long and Sommers just doesn't know when to end his film.After the film ended, the person I went with said, ""Well, it's better than 'The Matrix Revolutions.'"" That's not saying much, but, I suppose it's something.",Van Helsing
174,TheHande,Almost like Castlevania,8,3 December 2005,"Hugh Jackman is definitely the Clint Eastwood of our generation. On screen he has such a presence that the viewer can't be but fascinated and wonder what is he thinking right now. In this severely under-rated Monster-Fantasy-Adventure Jackman performs the role of vampire-hunter/monster-slayer Van Helsing.The movie appears to have various flares to it. From James Bond to Castlevania which is something I really enjoyed. As far as werewolves go, I thought the CG on most of the creatures was very well done as were the computer-effects in most parts of the movie. The additional comic elements also give the movie extra-life.Even so certain parts of the film were perhaps a bit goofy, but all in all this is a brilliant adventure.

They seem to be too scared from original themes so they just repack, remix and recycle old ideas, spoiling everything in the mix.

The monsters do look cheesy (they seem like demos for old Radeon graphics cards), but there are hundreds of them so it looks COOL. There is no reasonable plot, just non stop action which looks COOL. The action scenes are mostly rendered so they can create COOL shots, camera circles around the action like fly on LSD which is probably COOL too. Everyone knows the story is unimportant, its only function is to bring us to another COOL action scene. Lots of Eastern Europe mythological beings are wasted - the Eastern horror stories are slow, dark and very bloody. There is no blood (to get good ratings, probably) so the whole movie looks like insane battle of little plastic soldiers - Cobra 11 style.

179,rparham,A textbook guilty pleasure,7,23 April 2005,"Many of us have, as children, engaged in the fascination of pitting various different fictional beloved characters against each other in a variety of scenarios. ""What if Superman fought Spider-Man?"" Van Helsing is the big-budget silver screen treatment of one of those scenarios, involving three of the biggest horror icons in film history, Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man. These three legends have been tossed into the blender, along with a mix of special effects, elaborate production design and action, then writer-director Stephen Sommers hit puree resulting in something, which, while not a masterpiece, does have the capability to entertain.Although billed as a modern updating of the Universal horror films of the '30s and '40s, Van Helsing has very little in common with those films. They were low-budget mood pieces, cultivated by a studio which, as a ""major minor"" (i.e. a studio with no theater chain), couldn't afford to make the big event films that competitors such as MGM was churning out in those days. The horror film was also custom built for Universal's talent base, many of whom had a German film background and were steeped in German expressionism, featuring harsh shadows and dark subject matter. Van Helsing, on the other hand, while maintaining some of the look of those old films, is a hyped-up action film, lacking much in the way of any scares, no suspense to speak of, and enough money obviously being spent to fund a small country.The film opens with a sequence filmed in black and white, proving Sommers does have an understanding of where the roots of his film come from. The prologue features Dr. Frankenstein bringing his creature to life, under the watchful eye of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburg). When Dr. Frankenstein isn't happy with the plans Dracula has for his creation, Dracula kills him and the monster flees, only to be trapped in a nearby windmill which is burned to the ground by an angry mob of villagers. The film then introduces us to our hero, hunting down one Mr. Hyde in the towers of Notre Dame Cathedral, a double homage to both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. After dispatching Hyde, Van Helsing, working for a secret organization representing all religions of the world, is ordered to Transylvania to assist the dying Valerious clan, who has sworn a pact to never enter heaven until Dracula is destroyed, and of whom only two are left, sister and brother Anna (Kate Beckinsale) and Velkan. In Transylvania, Van Helsing, accompanied by a medieval version of Q, Friar Carl (David Wenham), discovers that Dracula is planning to use the research of Dr. Frankenstein to bring his undead children to life, not to mention that Velkan has been transformed into a werewolf by Dracula, and that Frankenstein's monster has survived and is being hunted by Dracula.As with The Mummy and The Mummy Returns before it, Van Helsing is a film that has it's tongue firmly planted in it's cheek. You can never really take anything too seriously at any point in the film, it all has a light air to it. Many have been turned off by this aspect of the film, but I didn't find it distracting. Sure, it's not Shakespeare, but it also isn't total camp either. It's absolutely ridiculous, yes, but Sommer's energy and desire to have a good time is infectious, and the film was just fun to watch.Van Helsing is wall-to-wall action from start to finish. Thre is little time to take a breath in between one major set-piece and the next, so those looking for a slow-paced film had best look elsewhere. Van Helsing is all chases, fights, shoot-outs and brawls, and yet, unlike films from uber-action director Michael Bay, the action sequences never really get boring. Perhaps it's because they are all unique in one sense or another, with Sommers never really repeating something after using it once. The action sequences are top notch also, well choreographed and exciting. If you are in search of a good action film, Van Helsing would fit the bill on this level.Van Helsing also features stunning production design. I have always been a fan of Gothic horror film imagery, and this film is bathed in it. From the castles, to the costumes, to the weaponry, it's a feast for the eyes and should be in contention for the art direction award come Oscar season.Acting wise, Van Helsing is a mixed bag. Hugh Jackman equits himself well enough, managing to stay believable while surrounded by strange sights and sounds. Kate Beckinsale, as Anna, doesn't fare quite as well. Her accent and sometimes overblown reactions to what's happening on screen help make her one of the less impressive performers in the film. Richard Roxburg is a bit over the top at times with his accent and mannerisms, but the material pretty much calls for it. The worst example of actors pushing the limits are Dracula's three brides (Elena Anaya, Sylvia Colloca and Josie Maran) who are constantly writhing, hissing, spitting and just generally making a nuisance of themselves. They could have been toned down considerably.Van Helsing is a film that would be filed in the area of ""guilty pleasure."" There is stuff here to criticize, but at the same time, I can't help but enjoy myself while watching it, and in the end, isn't that all that matters.",Van Helsing
180,kevinxirau,"This is, dare I say it, fang-tastic.",8,7 November 2011,"Universal's greatest monsters are back, this time in a monster mash unlike any other. Stephen Sommers, director of ""The Mummy"", brings a new set of rules and updates to his creatures and makes Van Helsing an awesome, well-equipped action hero. So let's spread our wings, charge up, and take a bite into this action-packed creature feature.Plot: Dracula, the Prince of Darkness, had Dr. Frankenstein create his monster for a nefarious purpose, but the vampire lord loses both the good doctor and his creation. A year later, having finished business in Paris (Mr. Hyde), monster hunter Van Helsing, alongside his genius sidekick Carl, is sent by the Knights of the Holy Order to Transylvania to kill Dracula while protecting Princess Anna from him. However, Dracula has three brides, a werewolf, and other creatures under his control. With the help of Carl, Anna, and Frankenstein's monster, Van Helsing sets out to stop this monster madness with an arsenal of crazy weapons and an attitude to match.This is a great tribute to the classic monster movies. Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster have great updates, cool designs, and unique twists to their characters. Van Helsing is tough as nails and Anna is both sexy and strong. Both characters do have soft spots, especially for each other. Carl, along with many other things in this movie, is pretty darn funny. It's great the way all these characters are tied together in this crazy battle for the fate of the world.With a complex story, nice effects, fun music, good comedy, and awesome action scenes, this movie is sure to please. A must-see film. Check it out. Be sure to bring stakes, crosses, silver bullets, and fire.",Van Helsing
181,Mitch-38,"Van Help Me, This Was Not Very Good",3,1 August 2004,"The star of this film, known to many of us, as CGG (Computer Generated Graphics) does well, despite its overuse and obvious animation. This is a rehash of many a horror film, and when one is retooling it for an updated modern version (as they will in the future for this popular genre), the screenwriters and director need to add an essential, original point that will make people stand up and take notice. VH has no such originality, nor zing. Hugh Jackman delivers such a wooden performance, one is terribly tempted to call Geppetto to see if he was missing one of his puppets. The chemistry between his character and Ms. Beckinsale's character is so poor; I was assuming he was gay. Not that there's anything wrong about that, and it would have been a cool and groundbreaking route to go with this venerated character of horror movie lore. Once again, I digress to hint of any originality which could spice up a deadly dull flick like this one. Kate Beckinsale does sparkle in her role, exuding sexuality and vim, which saved this writer from having to rate this whole escapade as a bomb/turkey/junk/pond water, etc. Also, Richard Roxburgh, who literally and figuratively chews upon the scenery like an Atkins diet drop out on a loaf of fresh baked pumpernickel. Richard had a good time with this role, and it shows, as his relish is strong. Aside from these, the film get stodgy, dull and CGC happy for most of its cruel, crushing 132 minutes. The Hyde character, conveniently borrowed from another turkey (League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen...*yawn*) doesn't perk up the production a flip. A lot more backfires than starts, in what should have been a fun romp around the macabre side. Instead, VAN HELSING tries to dazzle us with poor animation and script, as well. As I stopped yawning, pondering this picture, I regain the senses enough to type out the following words: NOT RECOMMENDED.",Van Helsing
182,Alex-372,The X-Men meet Aliens and Frankenstein,7,6 November 2005,"Can you say 'derivative'? Not that that is always bad, sometimes something new and original rolls out. However...Van Helsing is a run of the mill fantasy/horror movie that tries and fails to be a horror/comedy as well.Although this is a very staid genre, here, The X-Men meet Aliens and a host of other Gothic stories and concepts, mainly Frankenstein. The James Bond take on a 19th century vampire hunter was unique, but flowed out of the whole X-Men vibe the movie had. Van Helsing is stuck with his own version of Q, a friar who makes undead killing weaponry.When a secret order of the church, Van Helsing's regular employers, get word that one of their Transsylvanian vampire hunting families is in trouble, Van Helsing is dispatched to that far and strange place of the mind. After making a deal with the devil or the church, centuries ago the family promised that until they killed Dracula, none of their deceased ancestors could enter heaven.Meanwhile, Dracula is busy employing the services of dr. Frankenstein, to create an electric elixir of life that will allow his manifold scions to live. These baby vampires, you see, have a tendency to just blow up in a messy goo whenever they get ready to make their first kill. As this won't do, and I guess Dracula is tired of reproducing by just biting people, he gets dr. Frankenstein to make the Monster of Frankenstein, run huge amounts of electricity through it and, miraculously transfer the proper life force to his Aliens-like brood. The villagers meanwhile are wholly unaware of this new development, as they are more than happy to let Dracula and his three 'brides' suck the life out of one or two of their kin every month. The number of these potential new vampires is enormous, and you have to wonder whether Dracula didn't have the foresight to see that this would lead to a huge vampire overpopulation problem. Who are they going to suck blood out of? They would depopulate all of Rumania. Anyway, I, like the movie, digress...This is not the very worst horror movie ever made. However, the jokes fall flat, and you have to like Hugh Jackman (I don't). Also, Kate Beckinsale seems a little underpowered in her vampire fighting pirate queen outfit. However the worst I guess are the British accents of the Transsylvanian villagers, which, alongside the CGI laden sets, never let you forget that this is a British studio production. An homage to the Hammer days is one thing, making a good movie out of this is another.(I liked Sleepy Hollow with Johnnie Depp and Christina Ricci better. Although it has a lot of the same feel, the story is weirder and actually scary in places.)",Van Helsing
183,Spideyfan-963-246215,Van Helsing (2004),10,1 November 2017,"Van Helsing (2004) Starring: Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, David Wenham, Richard Roxburgh, Shuler Hensley, Elena Anaya, Will Kemp, Kevin J. O'Connor, Alun Armstrong, Silvia Colloca, Josie Maran, Tom Fisher, Samuel West, Robbie Coltrane, and Stephen Fisher Written & Directed By: Stephen Sommers Review ADVENTURE LIVES FOREVER Hello Kiddies your pal the Crypt-Critic here with a tale about a time long ago, a time called the 90s. During this mystical time a group of wonderful folks had the idea of remaking all the classic Universal movie Monsters. This Era brought us gems such as Bram Stokers Dracula directed by Francis Ford Coppola and two I haven't seen like Mary Shelly's Frankenstein and Wolf with Jack Nicholson. Now it was time for The Mummy to return but instead of making it horror, they turned it an action/adventure extravaganza directed by Stephen Sommers who went on to do the sequel. Both of which made money, it was only a matter of time until Universal would give him there monster properties. Stephen Sommers opted to do a franchise with all of the other monsters with the main focus being on the great and legendary monster hunter of them all VAN HELSING! Famed monster slayer Gabriel Van Helsing is dispatched to Transylvania to assist the last of the Valerious bloodline in defeating Count Dracula. Anna Valerious reveals that Dracula has formed an unholy alliance with Dr. Frankenstein's monster and is hell-bent on exacting a centuries- old curse on her family. This movie is a great big fantastical adventure from start to finish. The movie gives us great performances from Hugh Jackman as Gabriel, if they so happen to go with the original Van Helsing Abraham I think Hugh could pull that off as well if they give him the same great make-up from Logan. Kate Beckinsale is always a plus, if a movie's got Vampires, werewolves and Kate Beckinsale I'll see it because that is my biggest guilty pleasure. Richard Roxburgh is a pretty damn good Dracula, he has one scene that I really like where he's like ""No! I have no heart, I feel no love, no fear, no joy, no sorrow, I am hollow and I live forever."" The score for this movie is cool it gives off the movies epic adventure vibe. I'm pretty sure this film is inspiration for a new Van Helsing named Liesel Van Helsing, daughter of the original Abraham Van Helsing. They both have a similar attire. The direction from Stephen is great it's sad to know that isn't directing movies anymore if any he should be in charge of the dark universe. The special effects are terrible though, that I will not defend. But I had to much fun with this experience that it just didn't bother me. The wolf-man and designs of Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster also made it less bothersome , I loved the designs of the monsters. The werewolf transformation is also cool and very different from other werewolf films. Van Helsing is the kind of film you don't take seriously, you just grab some popcorn and go on a fantastical adventure with Hugh Jackaman and the sexy, sexy, sexy, sexy and did I mention sexy Kate Beckinsale. I'm giving Van Helsing a five out of five.",Van Helsing
184,r-c-s,the league of extraordinary monsters: the undertaker's tribute to universal 1930s horror,8,30 December 2008,"This movie clearly follows the cliché of the league of extraordinary gentlemen, with monsters standing in for heroes: the initial scene is no other than a mr. Hyde chase. However, I suppose the main goal of this movie is to pay a close homage to Universal 1930s horrors...many scenes, motifs and settings are literally copied and it's IMPOSSIBLE to appreciate the movie without having first watched EVERY classic universal horror movie. Without the proper frame of reference, it all becomes a garbled hodgepodge that only borrows the worst from the league of extraordinary gentlemen; for example the topic of a ""cure for the werewolf"" has to be understood in the light cast from numerous old horrors. Van Helsing appears as the wrestler UNDERTAKER (check beard, hat, dress ) in his WWF 1980s version. There are elements coming from too many movies to list: Ring of the Nibelungs is one, James Bond (the underground experimental lab). Well, this is a visually stunning SFX extravaganza, not a theater play, so it has to be taken for what is worth: I for one like the 'victorian sci-fi' angle... Acting: there is not much to say, but I found actors did a fine job for this kind of movie. Ah, check the princess doing acrobatic moves on stiletto heels!",Van Helsing

186,David_Frames,Undead on arrival,5,6 May 2004,"*Contains Spoilers*Steven Sommers is dangerous. You may not have been conscious of it until now but the man has abilities that would make many of his more fantastical characters seem redundant. Like a photochemical blue ring octopus, Sommers can paralyze the human body in less than two hours, causing higher brain functions to shut down completely. Gradually secondary functions, such as motor control, breathing and the ability to sit up straight encroach on impossible. Before long you're looking down the business end of misanthropic meltdown, a few frames away from becoming undead yourself. Will Hugh Jackman show up to put you out of your misery? Will he f***.You've seen Van Helsing before. I know you don't think so at the moment but cast your mind back to Sommer's last reworking of classic, better made horror fare, The Mummy and you've got the tone, characters and production methodology reproduced with a painful attention to detail. Evidently people attending the former sent all responsible the wrong message, namely that what the public wanted was more of the same, so you see you've only got yourselves to blame. I'll certainly be punishing myself this evening.
VH was supposed to be Sommer's slightly darker take on Universal's classic monster flicks but Sommers is no James Whale, though based on the evidence presented here he deserves to sample Whale's favourite pastime soon, preferably at the hand(s) of the seven footer playing Frankenstein's monster. Said creature isn't a bad metaphor for this flick, stitched together as it is from Whale's movies and Sommer's previous efforts. A copy of a copy then and with all the generational loss that implies, it's a depressing indictment of the directors big dumb fun' approach but it's too dumb to be any real fun and big in this case simply means the great man's trademark noise, wall to wall (sometimes surprisingly shoddy) computer generated effects and so close to one dimensional they can taste it, characters who constantly talk exposition rather than say anything, `We've got to get this to Van Helsing', `She's DEAD', `we've got 48 hours to save you/the world/our dignity' etc The characters and plot, and I use the term lightly, replicate the Mummy perfectly. Jackman stands in for Fraser, the guy you've never heard of is John Hannah providing the not in any way comic relief and Weisz is brought back from the cine-dead as Beckensale, impersonating her kick ass heroine Schick with care but being careful to have a east European accent so that the Mummy's leading lady can't show up at Universal and claim her pay packet. She even dies for God's sake. It's a poorly cut up corpse, messy in the mid-section with a blaring, ear bleeding soundtrack designed to stun the audience so that they won't notice the plot holes. It starts promisingly enough with a black and white prologue that recalls the original Frankenstein but after that this one heads for the grave with Jackman's Indiana Van Helsing, more a monster killing James Bond than anything conceived of by Bram Stoker, getting his orders from the Vatican(!), stocking up on weapons and sodding off to Transylvania to kill some really very good looking women and saving the world. That's it and you should know that by going to see this movie you're only encouraging Sommer's to make more so don't do it. He can be stopped but only if we all pull together. It's demographically target overproduced bilge from the vat marked franchise' but who are these people exactly? You, me? The teenaged gang sitting behind me in the cinema loved it, laughing in all the right places and evidently lapping up every minute. That they looked like habitual drug users was a matter of some concern. At $135M wouldn't it have been cheaper just to give these kids smack?  I lost two hours of my life today and although I'd only penciled in some light cooking and a screening of Gag Factor'(the biopic of comedian Tommy Cooper), I can't help but feel a little bitter. Cooper's gagging was impressive to say the least, incidentally. Complete cock.",Van Helsing
187,ivko,kind of a mess,5,5 November 2018,"There are some interesting takes on the vampire legend in this movie, but unfortunately they are buried beneath confusing plot twists, problems with tone, and a script that is about 30 minutes too long. The movie features Hugh Jackman as the legendary vampire hunter Van Helsing, but a quasi-immortal version of Helsing that can't remember his past except in flashes of nightmares. Kate Beckinsale plays Anna Valerious, an action hero in her own right whose family has a history with Dracula.Also making appearances in the film are Dr. Jeckle/Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein and his creation, and the Wolf man. The plot revolves around a confusing scheme by Dracula to harvest the science of Frankenstein to become a baby daddy and Van Helsing attempting to release Anna's ancestors into heaven, and also werewolves for whatever reason. There's also a separate plot teased about how Van Helsing was somehow responsible for creating Dracula, although as far as I can tell a few allusions is all the movie delivers, perhaps because they expected to get sequels that never materialized.My biggest problem with the movie is tone. For the first 30 minutes I literally couldn't tell if the movie was supposed to be a horror thriller or a slapstick parody. Dramatic scenes will be suddenly put on hold while characters crack jokes with a wink to the audience before picking right back up with drama. I think this was a conscious choice, kind of like they want to say ""hey we get it, this is silly stuff."" But instead of coming off as hip, it mostly just serves to drain any dramatic tension they were building.The other issue is time. Good lord this is a long film for a horror movie. The extra length is used to add several additional meaningless battles in the middle of the movie that just go nowhere. They could have clipped Anna's brother out completely and just brought Van Helsing to his battle with Dracula sooner and the movie would have flowed so much better.In the end, I felt like there were some interesting moments here, but I was too frustrated waiting for them to get to the movie's climax to appreciate them. Instead I just felt like I must have missed a previous movie that explained all of the backstory the characters referenced in this film but never explained.",Van Helsing

This is a dinamic romp, winking at the best action movies ever made, with a lead character who is a mix of Indiana Jones and James Bond (mostly the latter), and we have a very good looking (can I say gorgeous?) heroine, a classic villain who as usual steal the scene with the better jokes of the movie, and a bunch of other characters, that are as usual thin as paper but normally fun or really beautiful (the vampire brides are as usual very beatiful).

189,Ronin47,Worse than I imagined (1/2*),1,8 June 2004,"""Van Helsing"" could very well be the funniest movie of 2004. The only problem is that the parts that are SUPPOSED to be funny aren't funny at all, and all the parts that AREN'T supposed to be funny are hysterical. This is one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen, and not in a good way.Hugh Jackman plays the famous titular character (who I don't believe was ever envisioned as a swarthy superhero, but oh well), who is sort of like the James Bond of whatever century this is set in (I didn't care enough to notice). He has gadgets, works for the Catholic church, and goes around killing monsters. While the original character of Van Helsing was only after Dracula, this Van Helsing also fights Frankenstein's monster, the Wolf Man, and in the first horribly bad scene in the movie, Mr. Hyde (who is shown here as a sort of ultra fake-looking giant pudgy caveman). There are simply too many idiotic parts in this movie that I couldn't possibly recite them all. There's Kate Beckinsale's ludicrous ""gypsy"" accent (""Ze Frankenstein monsta!""), Richard Roxburgh (who was great in ""Moulin Rouge"") playing one of the worst Draculas in movie history, the terrible ""brides of Dracula"" (one of them taunts Van Helsing with the devastating grade school put-down ""Too bad. So sad!""), the dopey comic relief, the complete over-use of (badly done) CGI... I could go on and on. And I haven't even mentioned Jackman bounding around in a loincloth, or the ""funny sidekick"" played by David Wenham who I was dearly hoping would get killed.On the plus side, there are some pretty nice sights here and there, of mountains and castles and such. All completely fake of course.Some movies can be dumb in a smart way (like the ""Charlie's Angels"" movies), or at least dumb in an entertaining way. ""Van Helsing"", though it certainly has enough unintentional laugh-out-loud moments to make it slightly bearable, is so dumb and so long (almost 2 1/2 hours!) that it ends up draining the energy from you instead of giving you a surreal good time, like the best ""bad"" movies can do. Combining all the classic monsters into one film is a nice idea, but it was already done in 1987, in ""The Monster Squad"", one of my favorite horror movies as a kid. That movie was much scarier than this piece of crap, and was INTENTIONALLY funny. So rent that instead.",Van Helsing
190,CrassActionHero,More Dopey Than Jessica Simpson,2,27 November 2006,"Van Helsing. So Hugh Jackman tries to expand. With Van Helsing, don't push your luck Wolverine.Review: Van Helsing, despite the cool name is far from it. We have a hunter, Helsing, who kills vampires and other creatures of the night. Reasons why are unknown to us. The first thing you will notice is the look of Helsing. Jackman looks cool at least. We also get Kate Beckinsale, so why does this suck? Allow me to tell you. First, The dialog. This movie must have some of the dumbest dialog ever. It will leave you wondering ""What?"" Another is the bad directing. When Helsing is given his mission, they show a picture of two people, one being Beckinsale and after given his mission, the camera looks ONLY at Beckinsale's side of the photo, not the other individual that is just as important. Perhaps Helsing was thinking ""She's hot."" ""If I succeed, perhaps I'll get some."" That's the impression that I got. Another is too much action. Many would not complain about that. So Crass, you would ask, ""Why does that suck?"" Reason: Some of the action is sloppy and with too much action is another way to dodge CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Yes, the ultimate weakness is a tremendous lack of character development. We learn absolutely nothing about anyone. That's why Helsing's reasons to hunt down creatures of the night is unknown to us. He just does. How uninteresting. Also the one who played Faramir in the Lord of the Rings movies is here, However he is a totally annoying monk that sports a hairstyle that would be unappealing to a five year old. His dialog is the worst. Also the acting is quite wooden, with the exception of Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. His performance is quite good. He seemed to be the only one here to try and save this movie, but it's a lost cause. What started out as a attempt at a new franchise is going to crash before takeoff.The Last Word: Disaster. Van Helsing is a poorly executed, inane mess that fails on so many levels. I cannot believe that I managed to stomach any of this mess. The ONLY reason that this gets a two is that I gave Helsing an extra point out of pity. Jackman, stick with Wolverine OK?",Van Helsing

Firstly I'm not a huge fan of CGI and to be honest I was getting rather tired of it but Van Helsing looks absolutely stunning. I loved the design of the whole film, the sets and landscapes were amazing. Also the special effects were fabulous. Hugh Jackman could have done with been given a little depth to his character but he was great as Van Helsing as was his sidekick who was very funny in his role as the Friar. I'm not so sure about Kate Beckinsales acting ability but she looks absolutely beautiful anyway. I did find the actor portraying Count Dracula a little OTT even for this film though!, Frankensteins Monster was better represented in the acting stakes. I'm no expert on the old Universal monster movies being Scottish I was brought up on the Hammer Horror films with the likes of Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee and have always loved a good horror film.

It blends several stories together: Dracula, Frankenstein, and the legends of the werewolf.I won't bother going in to the plot. This is not the kind of movie to see if you're interested in plot. This is also not the kind of movie to see if you're interested in characters. This is not the kind of movie to see if you're interested in using your brain at all.Having said that, it's a fun enough movie. Sure, it takes loads of liberties with famous fictional characters. Yeah, it doesn't tax the acting abilities of Hugh Jackman or Kate Beckinsale (although David Wenham is terrific as the mousy, brainy, and horny Friar Carl).But it is action packed, with lots of stunts and special effects and other early-teen fodder. The make-up and sets (whether CG or real) are very well done. And it's not vulgar, a plus for movies of this genre.A big problem I had with this film was the overuse of CGI effects, especially during the climactic battle scene. It was almost painful to watch.

196,extravaluejotter,More is Less,4,25 December 2006,"Oh dear, Stephen Sommers. Having hit the big time with action adventure ""The Mummy"", Mr Sommers is a living example of the law of diminishing returns. ""The Mummy Returns"" is a distinctly so-so sequel and ""Van Helsing"" barely scrapes over the low standard set by Sommers' wet 1998 disaster movie, ""Deep Rising"".So what's so bad about ""Van Helsing""? After all, Sommers managed to plunder the movie legend of ""The Mummy"" pretty successfully, so he knows how to breathe new life into a stale old genre. He's a pretty good screenplay writer and a good director, and the production design of ""Van Helsing"" screams ""Quality"".Well, er, that may be part of the problem. It looks like a big chunk of the budget went on props, sets and locations, judging by the lack of big name stars in the cast list. Hugh Jackman does well as the eponymous hero but he doesn't get much support from the rest of the cast. Poor old Richard Roxburgh tries so hard to be Dracula but is too subtle to be noticed in anything but the fight scenes. Samuel West is cruelly wasted in the far-too-brief role of Victor Frankenstein. David Wenham twinkles occasionally as Van Helsing's friar sidekick but his mannered performance is drowned out by the movie's excesses. Kate Beckinsale proves that she can act pretty well, but is sidelined by her character's improbable costume and ludicrous stunts. Much like Rachel Weisz in ""The Mummy Returns"" and Carrie Ann Moss in ""The Matrix"", Beckinsale's role in ""Van Helsing"" is merely Eye Candy with Weapons and Martial Arts Moves.Kate Beckinsale's costume demands a special mention. Somewhere between Trinity and Mad Max, she is trussed up in buckled thigh boots and bodice for the whole picture. Despite looking like she's ready for a night at the Torture Garden, she manages to run, jump, leap, fall and fight like a commando. This demands a suspension of disbelief akin to bungee jumping without a bungee.Yup, that's the main problem with this movie. It demands too much from the viewer. The plot is something to do with Dracula using werewolves and evil German dwarfs as henchmen in a plot to use Frankenstein's re-animation process to bring a vampiric horde to life. Having despatched Mr Hyde in Paris, Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to help Anna Valerious, a gypsy princess whose family have been battling Dracula for 400 years. Got all that? There's more besides. The plot is thrown at you by the bucket-load, then you're swept into another action set-piece before you get a chance to work out what the hell is going on. The action sequences start off as adequate but quickly plunge into the realms of disbelief. It's almost as if you can see the CGI budget ebbing and flowing during the course of the picture. Mr Hyde is pretty well rendered, but the flying vampire brides look patently fake. The demonic vampire offspring get too much screen time and their interaction with the human cast members harks back to the Time Before Harryhausen. The coach-and-six jumping over the ravine looks OK but the idea of a horse-drawn vehicle leaping 50-odd feet is preposterous. Mr Sommers needs to take a step back from this movie and work out where it all went wrong. Even more so than with ""The Mummy Returns"", he over-reached himself in terms of plot and special effects and allowed his cast to be swamped in the resulting deluge. As he's due to have a stab at re-inventing ""Flash Gordon"" in the near future, I hope that he gets his ""The Mummy"" mojo back sooner rather than later.",Van Helsing
197,Pavel-8,The summer movie onslaught has begun.,6,13 May 2004,"""Van Helsing"" tells the story of the titular character (Hugh Jackman), who serves the Vatican as a sort of black ops agent whose missions are to eradicate various unrepentant monsters. His primary task here is to destroy the horrific triumvirate of Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster. With his own medieval Agent Q (LOTR's David Wenham), our hero ventures to Transylvania to team up with the stunning Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), the last survivor in a noble family that must kill Dracula or be condemned forever to purgatory.Although I think the makers of ""Van Helsing"" tried to inject a dose of heart their work, they still produced little more than a good summer popcorn movie, and I don't mean that as an insult. Director Stephen Sommers also helmed ""The Mummy"" and its sequels, and while I would rate Van Helsing ahead of those movies, it is cast from the same mold. If you go in with expectations of greatness, you'll no doubt hate it and be utterly disappointed. But if you settle in looking for nothing more than 2+ hours of fun, nearly campy entertainment, you'll be thoroughly satisfied.
A large reason that it falls short of being even a good movie is the derivative nature of the entire flick. Although set in a dark neo-Victorian age (in which it always seems to be raining), ""Van Helsing"" contains countless scenes that bring to mind various classics. Whether it be Van Helsing's Batman-esque tools, his gadget room borrowed from James Bond, shots taken from Looney Tunes, or a scene straight out of ""Get Smart"" (yes, that's right), so much of the movie has been done before. More than any other, Van Helsing imitates The Indiana Jones Trilogy in ways ranging from the hero's attire to how certain characters die to the use of a map to display travel. Even Alan Silvestri's music recalls one of Indy's secondary themes. While this derivative nature prevents ""Van Helsing"" from being a truly good film, it does provide a alternative unique form of entertainment. Half the fun of the movie is pinpointing the pervasive cinematic references.
The other half of the fun comes from the overall appearance and content. While these well-known characters have been portrayed on the screen hundreds of times through the years, rarely are they seen so vividly in an action movie such as this. Jackman possesses a perfect look for the swashbuckling protagonist; Roxburgh not only twirls his mustache well, but does add some humanity to the blood-sucking count. Beckinsale, in a role not all that different from her turn in Underworld, isn't asked to do much but look vengeful and beautiful, and does just that, managing to fight ferociously in tight clothes while still maintaining her gorgeous and pristine appearance. Wenham, in stark contrast to his noble Faramir, fills the thankless comic relief role, and does so rather well, considering what he is given to work with.The rest of the cast consists primarily of minor roles or special effects. Unfortunately while the physical appearance of the movie is excellent, the visual effects aren't always up to par. They're not bad, but also aren't quite seamless with the rest of the flick. Every once in a while something doesn't quite match or feels just a little too fake. With so many effects done by many different effects houses, perhaps this was inevitable, but the minor discrepancies are still occasionally distracting, which is the one thing that visual effects should not be.The effects are not helped by the fact that the movie, at nearly two and a half hours, is twenty minutes too long. As enjoyable as the various people and fights are, one can only take so much of horror characters scurrying around doing battle. Trimming a few minutes out of about every scene would have made the remaining excitement that much more enjoyable, resulting in a more streamlined and bearable picture. As it is, everything drags on too long, permitting what could have been a taut adventure film to unravel into a messier and less cohesive movie.As the movie that kick-starts the summer season, ""Van Helsing"" receives some leeway. Had it been released in August, it probably wouldn't have been nearly as enjoyable, following a summer of similarly action-packed but largely forgettable fare. But with cinematic tastebuds longing for fresh popcorn after a stale spring, Van Helsing survives its shortcomings to provide a satisfying if short-lived treat.Bottom Line: Decent summertainment, at least as the first biggie of the season.  6/10, for fun as much as quality.",Van Helsing
198,sini-200,Decent Dracula Movie,6,27 August 2021,"I've seen this couple times and it proves to be a decent vampire film, nothing special, cheap CGI, cliche plot( though the diverse monster list is a nice touch) with quite predictable ending. The move is quite long and could have been cut shorter cos towards the end it gets too boring. But Hugh Jackman definitely carries the movie however Kate Beckinsale's role as Anna Valerious is well performed too. Watch this with not so serious mind and you will enjoy the movie, and is worth your time.",Van Helsing
199,kergillian,"Better than expected, but hardly an epic...",6,25 March 2005,"From the opening scenes, lifted straight from the classic Karloff Frankenstein, I could see the 'tributes' were beginning. And Sommers didn't disappoint, lifting bits from multiple films, from Star Wars and Indiana Jones to The Wolf Man and John Carpenter's Vampires.That aside, the film itself was, as a friend put it, a great popcorn film. Entertaining and witty, interesting effects and smooth cinematography. On the other hand, if you're expecting to see The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, check your expectations at the door, because this film is not nearly as clever or original as those films were.A couple of PROs: The Frankenstein monster's intelligence was a real plus. The one thing that always bothered me about the Karloff films was that the monster was purely animal and had no apparent non-instinctual intelligence. This monster reflects the book much more purely in character, as he becomes intellectual, and, essentially human.As well, I LOVED David Wenham in this (playing Carl). Those who know him only as Faramir in the LotR trilogy will be pleasantly surprised at his standout performance. Those who've seen some of the other films he's done, like Russian Doll, will be less surprised - though equally amused.CONs: The ending was LAAAAAAAAME!! I won't post spoilers, but the entire end sequence, after the resolution, was absolutely ridiculously awful. I DID like the resolution, though - although the Archangel Gabriel idea was only mildly over-the-top...IN THE END: this film is basically a better Dracula 2000, which was a film with a ton of potential and very poor follow-through. I suspect that most people will enjoy this film, but few will wish to see it a second time. A truly entertaining popcorn film. 6.5/10",Van Helsing
200,Tenchi64589,This sucked!,1,4 July 2004,"I was set out to prove my local radio station wrong... I should have stuck with what they said. I originally thought it would be a halfway decent monster beat-down... however it was nothing more than CGI all around. I went with my dad and one of my friends (Both separately) and I got the same reaction... I had to get out of the theater before I died from boredomThis movie does less for the mind, and more for the sphincter.In closing, I say to you: Stay away from this one! 1/10 By the way, I think you all could learn from me... listen to your radio station when they say a movie's bad.",Van Helsing
201,skymovies,Pantomime doesn't get any better,8,25 May 2004,"Anyone who goes to an arse down/brain off movie like this expecting masterful plotting, sparkling dialogue and characters with depth shouldn't be there in the first place. When you're in Popcorn City, you don't stay long in the museum of high art.The New York Post blusters that Van Helsing `requires considerable suspension of disbelief'. No flies on those guys, eh, what with the streets being chock-full of vampires, werewolves and Frankenstein's monsters these days? Maybe they were referring to Kate Beckinsale's unsmudgeable make-up. Of course it's silly, loud and all over the place  that's the point. Those of a pretentious disposition are advised to stay home and pore over their Ingmar Bergman collections.This is non-stop, tongue-in-cheek fun. Even the exposition is larky. As scene crashes on top of OTT scene, it's amusing just to spot all the films being ripped off/borrowed from/homaged/pastiched: Aliens, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Stagecoach, Desperado, Gremlins, From Dusk Till Dawn, Star Wars, and any James Bond you care to mention. Even Dracula looks like the kiddie-catcher from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.No it's not hugely original and the last five minutes don't do it any favours, but who cares? This is better than any of the big-budget dreck we were subjected to in Summer 2003.",Van Helsing
202,robertofuiano,Good,10,25 January 2008,"Nice, really nice. It has an origin mostly comic but has good special effects. It was inevitable to see negative comments here, is the norm. Cmq a good movie, the environments are good actors suited to the type of film. He certainly part ironic, comic, the environments are very well linked to those of Transylvania and the result can be considered as satisfactory. It is a shame that here there are elements that bring more than 7 film ridiculous as the Army of darkness and films such as Van Helsing a miserable 5. Shame! I disagree with the standards is happening here, I am not convinced. In some cases there are good reviews, in other see that there are some 'too many prejudices against certain films!",Van Helsing
203,scobbah,Too much action - lack of story,6,13 May 2004,"After being served for nearly two hours of constant action, I could finally relax and breath. ""Van Helsing"" is filled with constant action, wicked combats, endless effects loaded together with some quick comments. I do think the whole movie started up well, but the more it developed the bigger the lack of story got, and the more action I was fed with. I think they went to much ""Matrix"" here, and lost the very important balance between having a good (deep) story and having awesome scenes of combat. Anyways, I experienced this piece at the cinema and I think that is a big plus, at least that is my conclusion. With all those visual effects and the astonishing audio experience it must be experienced at the cinema (or perhaps at home with some awesome audio equipment). As my head still feels a little wicked and as I probably haven't really melted the piece yet, I still think that 6 out of 10 is a fair grade for ""Van Helsing"".",Van Helsing
204,1bilbo,"Terrific Sound score, great entefrtainment.",9,30 October 2004,"This is a film that takes a lot of liberties but is great entertainment. I went back to the cinema three times just I could hear the audio score at full volume. The music is fantastic and the film basically does not stop for breath. Dracula is superb and Helsing is played with more than a little tongue in cheek.The church sends Helsing on a mission to wipe out Dracula and gives him a helper who is obviously modeled on Q from James Bond. A film buff will recognize many of the borrowed scenes  a stagecoach chase scene that is reminiscent of John Wayne and cliff edge scenes that reminded me of the many cliff falls that appeared in the roadrunner cartoons.The acting was great and the film tears along at breakneck pace with an ending that has a real twist, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Van Helsing
205,HaddonfieldJason,Kick Ass Summer Popcorn fun!,10,7 May 2004,"Spoilers within...First of all I am a huge fan of the Universal Studios Monsters,and I`ve been waiting for a resurrection of them. Sommers was just the man to do this. The film starts in B&W very clever,and a tribute to the Monsters. The plot Dracula needs the electric forces of the Frankenstein Monster to resurect his offspring,his weapon to protect him,The Wolfman. Yet he has to fear the great monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing,who in this version is a tool of God,and is played by Hugh Jackman,who did last years brilliant X2:X-Men United.He is not a science doctor.He works for a secret agency formed by The Catholic Church sworn to rid evil. His Q like assitant is Frair Carl,played hilariously by Lord of the Ring's David Wenham. They go to Transylvania to stop Dracula,and his brides from resurrecting their offspring.Van Helsing is fun,and action packed. Sommers has brought back life,and fun into the monsters. It is very entertaining,everyone will love it. And cant the bashers,just except that this is a film for popcorn purposes not to be the next Acadmey Award winner for 04!?4/4,But hey its just my opinion!",Van Helsing
206,udeaasykle,"A big disappointment, except the effects",5,19 May 2004,"This movie was so hyped up and the trailers was pretty good so i looked forward to a really cool movie with action, great effects and cool one liners from Hugh Jackman. Well there was action, and the effects was pretty cool but that was about that. The story itself is kind off weird and poorly done and the dialog couldn't carry the mail. I had to high expectations for this movie and that is what ruined it for me. I like Hugh Jackman and his role as Wolverine in the X-men movies is the only reason to watch them in my opinion. The worst scene in the movie is when Anne is hanging in the rope and has just received the antidote from Carl. I mean, look at the expression on her face... It is either hilarious or just stupid.

207,clydestuff,"Frankenstein's Monster, Werewolves, Dracula, Mr. Hyde, the gangs all here.",7,8 May 2004,"I think I've got this film critic business figured out.  After reading many of the reviews for Van Helsing, the great majority of which soundly panned the film, I have come to the following conclusion:  Critics loathe the summer film season.  They especially seem to loathe high budgeted special effects extravaganzas such as Van Helsing, especially when the trailers for it have been bombarding our senses for months, and you can't turn on the TV without hearing about it.  One would have to assume that they when they view a film such as this, there is a certain amount of bias working against it. So in reviewing the $200 million dollar Universal extravaganza, I think my job is supposed to be to blast the film into Hades with another scathing review.  Sorry, I can't do it. As it turns out, I did enjoy the film.What Writer and Director Stephen Sommers does do is to entertain us with a multitude of exciting hair raising sequences, aided by some spectacular CGI effects, and a cast of characters that hearken back to the old black and white films of Frankenstein, The Wolf Man, and Dracula. Even Mr. Hyde is on hand briefly to liven things up.  The film opens with a black and white sequence that is straight out of the original Frankenstein film.  Everything is here just as it should be, including Dr. Frankenstein, his not so loyal servant Igor, the monster himself, and the torch bearing citizens of Transylvania who are intent on having Frankenburgers courtesy of the Doctor and his protégé. What is different however, is that Count Dracula himself is on hand for the unveiling of Dr. Frankenstein's Monster, and has his own personal agenda to attend to.  Unfortunately for Count Dracula, the Monster regards Dr. Frankenstein as Daddy Dr. Frankenstein, and doesn't take too kindly to what the Count has in store for him.  It's a stunning, cleverly written opening to the film, and sets a relentless which barely leaves you time to breathe as it hurdles on fast forward from one action laden episode to the next.From the creation of Frankenstein Monster's we are immediately taken to the Notre Dame Cathedral where Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, is doing battle with Dr. Jekyll's alter ego Mr. Hyde.  By placing Hyde in the cathedral, Sommers manages also to pay a little big of homage to The Hunchback of Notre Dame. His mission, which comes directly from Rome, is to try and bring Hyde back to Rome alive to be studied if possible.  It is here with his own wry perspective on the matter that Jackman reminded me of a late nineteenth century James Bond.  He'll do the job and get it done, but he'll do it his way, orders or no orders.  It's a nice minor touch that immediately gives Jackman's Van Helsing a distinctive touch of personality not seen in any previous film incarnation of the character.Later, Van Helsing is ordered by Rome to travel to Transylvania to aid the lovely Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) in her quest to find and destroy Count Dracula.  It seems Anna and the family from which she is descended from, have been after Dracula for some time.  The only members of the family who are left to continue on with the quest are Anna and her brother Velkan (Will Kemp), and should they die before finishing their mission, their family will be damned to eternity in purgatory.  Along with Van Helsing is a Rome inventor and sidekick, Carl (David Wenham).  (He's a Friar not a Monk, and so is entitled to certain worldly pleasures).  It's a great bit that adds  some welcome humorous touches, lest we begin taking things a bit too serious.Where this film also excels is not just the adrenaline rushing action sequences.  Sommers uses the CGI, not just for a myriad of heart-pounding special effects,  but is smart enough to create an atmosphere where we can easily accept the notion that this is indeed Europe in the late nineteenth century.  In one scene, as the camera traverses the landscape of Paris, we see in the background a half-built Eiffel Tower.  It is this kind of meticulous attention to details that help lift this film a couple of notches above others in the genre by transporting us into a world we can immerse ourselves in completely.If the film has a fault, it is minor.  In the early moments, one is not sure if we are going to be witnessing an action film or a spoof.  Much of this is due to the initial campy over the top portrayal of Dracula by Richard Roxburgh and a few of his female disciples.  After the opening sequence during the creation of Frankenstein's Monster, Roxburgh and everyone else seems to settle down into just the right tone needed for the remainder of the running time.If you go into Van Helsing knowing that your are going to get two hours plus of non-stop sights and sounds to hammer your senses, along with some harmless mindless entertainment, you'll enjoy the film in all aspects.  It is highly imaginative, and very entertaining.  I had fun, and that's all I asked for.  And if I get what I ask for I have no choice but to give you my grade which for Van Helsing is a B+.",Van Helsing
208,cwade22,Where are the black people?,9,17 March 2019,"Zero black people? Lol. I'm half black, but honestly, I don't mind. It's not like it was racist Woody Allen purposefully snubbing black actors in his movies. The acting isn't the best in this movie. Almost every line is cliche and corny, from Dracula and others. But Dracula's brides are HOT! And the only thing that can kill him is a werewolf? I want to be Dracula! Anyway, I hate nbc/Comcast so I try to avoid universal but I like the sentimentality of the film, horror genre, and the opening of the film. I used to put my dvd of van heksing in my Xbox and just play it, and go to sleep. I also did the same with Halloween H20, and Batman animated series Mask of the Phantasm, so, it's not an insult to the films, they just calm me for bed. I want to be DRACULA!",Van Helsing

But the film started like it was a Gene Wilder spoof, and just carried on like it.I wasnt convinced with the Van Helsing choice of actor, but the lass was lovely and good to watch.Rather than go on and on I would summarize by saying that it is a film to watch as it does entertain. Definately not the worst of the year. The Matrix Pt 3 still has that title (DVD Release).Recommended. 6 out of 10

210,themarina1,An interesting foray into Universal's past,7,10 May 2004,"It's been obvious over the past few years that Hollywood is lacking imagination. There have been more sequels, prequels, remakes and recycling of characters and stories in the past 5 years than I care to admit to watching. Though there are always good and bad, this one falls in the grey area, leaning towards the good.Van Helsing has been played by many a character but I like this one the best. The movie is chalk full of great animation, fantastic action sequences and some of the best costumes I've seen in a little while. Though the story is a familiar one, this ""version"" does a good job of introducing a new generation to an old classic. Though I would have liked to see less ""monsters"" in this movie (what will they work with next? Not too many left from Universal's old vault)it still managed to keep me interested through. I do think that this is a little on the long side and at one point I wondered when they were going to get on with the story. The story itself is nothing new though some of the ""new"" details were interesting. An entertaining flick, this may be too much for those of us who watched some of these originals but it is a great intro for a new generation of movie watchers. Surprisingly, I found this very enjoyable and well worth my hard earned money. 7/10",Van Helsing

212,CountVladDracula,Things wrong with this movie...,1,17 August 2012,"1. Abraham Van Helsing, PROFESSOR ABRAHAM Van Helsing was a German man living in Amsterdam and with a Dutch name, who lead the band of heroes in defeating Dracula in the original novel by Bram Stoker. He was a wise, older man, not an action hero, not an angel with amnesia. The fact that he was NOT a youthful action hero was kind of the point. In fact the character most like Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing (the Texan, Quincey Morris) was the one who DIED in the Dracula novel while PROFESSOR Van Helsing survived. It was his cunning and wisdom that defeated Dracula, not a rapid fire cross bow and Dresden Files-esque duster.2. MAMMALS DO NOT LAY EGGS!!! WHY would female vampires, who used to be human, who take the form of bats (a MAMMAL) lay eggs!?? 3. Why would God erase Gabriel's memory to punish him? How is it a punishment if you don't know you're being punished or why? 4. Why give Dracula the name Vladislaus Dracula (what the Historical Vlad The Impaler signed his name as on documents) yet turn him into a gypsy with a birth age and date of death that don't add up. (Seriously, it claims he's in his twenties when you do the math. Richard Roxburough is NO twenty year old), just so that he can incestuously go after a gypsy descendant? 5. Why did Van Helsing show pity toward the Frankenstein creature but not The Wolfman or Jekyll. The reasoning is the creature didn't choose to be what he is but Jekyll never intended to create Hyde and the werewolf never asked to be bitten. It. does. Not. make. Sense.6. Why would the Vatican want to destroy an intelligent and apparently non-violent being? 7. I'm tired of the new cliché of action films (and anime) using The Vatican as some covert group of spies and assassins going after supernatural threats.8. WHY would a werewolf bite kill Dracula? If you read the novel he LIKED wolves, he called them the children of the night and went out of his way to calm and pet the trapped wolves at the London zoo. He can take wolf form himself! He was in the form of a wolf or ""large dog"" when he got off the Demeter in Whitby. Has no one actually read the novel!??",Van Helsing

214,joker-4,Wanting and wacky,5,17 May 2004,"In this age of FREDDY VS. JASON, LEAGUE OF EXTRORDINARY GENTLEMEN and the upcoming ALIENS VS PREDATOR, where team-ups and dream duels are getting attention, siccing one of the original monster hunters onto the phalanx of Universal's monster stable seems like the ultimate idea borrowing from such great premises as FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN and Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN. Unfortunately VAN HELSING is more akin to ABBOTT AND COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN. Perfect in concept, Stephen Sommers sets Man of the Church, Vampire Hunter Van Helsing to confront and destroy the most unholy of monster triumvirates, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Werewolf  and throw in Mr. Hyde to start the adventure off. Beautifully paying homage to FRANKENSTEIN at the film's start, VAN HELSING soon degrades into clichés and the convenience of unoriginality. From the scene in Rome where Friar Carl plays Q to Van Helsing's Bond to Van Helsing and Anna wading through hordes of unborn vampire sacs ala ALIEN's Ripley to the Indiana Jones-style stunts, the overused familiarity of the scenes became tedious. Sommers even had nods to Sam Raimi's ARMY OF DARKNESS and if the Frankenstein Monster broke into song and soft shoe like Peter Boyle in YOUNG FRANKESTEIN, well, that wouldn't have been too surprising.What VAN HELSING does offer is some fun action, cool stunt work and great camera angles taking the viewer along on this magical monster tour. Hugh Jackman proves, once again, that he is indeed a great action hero and holds together a mediocre script on a rather good- looking film with a solid cast. Richard Roxburgh's Dracula will hopefully be remembered and Kevin J. O'Connor's Igor blended both horror and humor. Alan Silvestri's score was perhaps too good for the likes of this movie and is a definite high point.If sequels are to scare up, hopefully Sommers will bring the Van Helsing character back to its more creepy and mysterious origins. One needs look no further than Coppola's 1992 Dracula with Anthony Hopkins in the hunter's role. Adding too much 'super' in the 'supernatural' role made VAN HELSING, like it's final battle scene, both wanting and wacky.",Van Helsing

Starts out somewhat intriguing, broaches the vampire hunter with some style and, well the rest of the movie is simply ruthless, brainless, and frivolous to the extent of disturbance. Generally, a film which boasts fantastic CGI can succeed IF it is reasonable and enjoyable enough for the audience to believe and enjoy its ""popcorn rollercoaster"". Yet, every once in a style, the likes of ""Van Helsing"" arrives, with ample anticipation and, it sincerely disappoints us in its desecrating foolishness, and we are merely lulled to sleep rather than intoxicated by its exhilaration and mindless fun. The creatures conquered by the vampire hunter whose name ""they all know"" are nothing short of ridiculous, silly plot contrivances to excuse the film's lack of innovation for better ideas. And this film could have greatly succeeded, if only handled on the right note, and not on the silliness of vampires, bats, and frankenstein creatures, none of which are either convincing nor exhilarating. Heart pounding music and impressive CGI, yet scarcely in the right places. Even the summer movie season should promise us more than ""Van Helsing"". ** out of ****",Van Helsing
217,Oosterhartbabe,Delightfully cheesy good fun!,2,6 February 2005,"This movie is a hilarious cheese-fest. Whether the director intended it to be this camp is hard to tell, although I personally believe that he deliberately made it tongue in cheek. Not only are there tributes to the old Dracula and Frankenstein movies of the 30's and 40's, there are also scenes practically lifted from other spoof films such as Dracula Dead and Loving It.Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing-a man with no past and no memories, and one of the worst and most incomprehensible German accents it has ever been my pleasure to laugh at. Plus, his hat is extremely stupid, as well. He works for a secret organization run from the Vatican, which dedicates itself to fighting and destroying evil creatures(Micheal Eisner?)After the silly black and white opening sequence, you see Van Helsing in 'London', fighting one of the worst CGI monsters I've ever seen. It's supposed to be Mr.Hyde, I guess. This is the start of many dreadful fight scenes full of bad CGI and lots and lots of stupid wire work.The Vatican's next assignment for Van Helsing(did the slide show self destruct after thirty seconds, I wonder?)is to track down and destroy Count Dracula, with the help of the last members of Dracula's human blood line. Along for the ride is a whiny friar who makes weapons and bombs in a basement. The last family members are a guy who gets bitten and turns into a terrible CGI werewolf who looks like he has porcupine quills instead of fur, and Kate Beckinsale in a long curly wig, high heels, and a corset so tight looking that I wondered how she could breathe, let alone do action sequences. As an added bonus, she sports an accent even worse than Jackman's or Dracula's.The flying 'brides of Dracula' sequences have about the same level of complexity as the flying demon girl in Army of Darkness. There are many bouts of silly dialogue interspersed with shots of Van Helsing firing a crossbow that seemingly has infinite ammunition.One of the brides is killed, and apparently she was made of green silly putty. All of the f/x on the vamps are just as bad.Dracula looks like he was gearing up to re-do the cover on the Beatle's Sargeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band album cover. His secret yearning is to be a Daddy, but the only way he can spawn his many ridiculous looking gargoylish devil children is to find a way to give them life, since he and his 'wives' are dead.He uses Kate Beckinsale's brother, who has become the aforementioned werewolf, to try to give his children life. It doesn't work, much to his chagrin. He wanted Dr. Frankenstein's monster because the good doctor had found a way to overcome death by sewing up his multiple body parts and zapping them with random bolts of electricity. With the loss of the monster, it looks as though his chances of becoming 'Undead Father of the Year' are rapidly fading.Luckily for him, the monster is not dead. Van Helsing and Anna stumble over it after they fall into a hole out of sheer carelessness. This is after they saw Dracula try to bring to life his first batch of cutesy, silly looking children. Unfortunately, this batch wasn't cooked thoroughly so they popped like popcorn. Dracula apparently knows Van Helsing, calling him Gabriel and hinting that he knows far more about his past than amnesia boy does himself. I have to ask-why does Hugh Jackman end up playing so many characters who have suffered a mysterious memory loss? Anyway, Van Helsing tries to smuggle the monster out of Transylvania via coach, but like all coach service this one is pretty crappy. There's a scene where the horses pulling the coach leap a gorge where the bridge is out as though they're Santa's flying reindeer rather than regular horses. Anna's werewolf brother, now thoroughly controlled by Dracula, interferes and is killed by Van Helsing. He bites Van Helsing before he dies, perhaps as a going away present. Then the single bride still left flying makes off with Anna. So the whole plan is botched, since Van Helsing offers to trade the monster to Dracula to get Anna back.Enter a Halloween bash being thrown by Cirque Du Soleil. Here Dracula waits to make the exchange, although really he's planning to have his cake and eat it to. He wants to make Anna a bride to replace his lost wives, and get the monster as well. Van Helsing, wearing a dumb Zorro mask, rescues Anna but loses the monster to Dracula. So now he has to find Dracula's palace, kill Dracula, get a cure for his lycanthropy, and rescue the monster. All before he turns into a raving blood thirsty werewolf for the rest of his life. Not too much to ask, huh? Suffice it to say that he manages all of these tasks. Anna gets killed while giving him the antidote to werewolfism, and there's another ridiculously stupid CGI sequence that's like It's A Wonderful Life as filtered through the Lifetime channel. In other words, pure sentimental schmaltz. Then you see Van Helsing and the friar riding off into the sunset. A CGI sunset, that is. And you see the freed Frankenstein monster sailing a raft to Fiji, apparently under the mistaken belief that he's Thor Heyerdahl. Or maybe Huck Finn, who knows?I laughed harder at this film than I have at some which are labeled as comedies. It's too bad that Mystery Science Theater 3000 went out of business, they'd have loved a film like Van Helsing.",Van Helsing
218,TheGreatMarkukini,Beautifully scary childhood memories,7,14 March 2019,"Vampires, werewolves and other bloodthirsty nocturnal creatures have been on our plate for a long time now but it's not easy for them to become boring as everyone wants to give its own touch to the monsters. So here comes yet another attempt to charm the world with noire adventures of spectacular hunter of supernatural, the owner of the best fells of hair of 2004 - Mr. Van Helsing.Stepping on ice you hope to make a safe but thrilling journey to the other bank, however, within a few steps a cracking sound widens through the silence and you slump under the layer of refreshing and incredible story. The chills are spreading further as Alan Silvestri's score kicks in and expedition to 1887 becomes a sole point of your attention for the next couple of hours.
The tones are dark, cold and bearing a constant brand of terror, which is sustained with amazing attention to the details: you are surrounded with so many tiny as well as enormous XIX century items that sliding glance from the screen raises an out-of-time bewilderment. From time to time you are treated with a ""drive by"" jokes that are fast, make you grin and don't distract you from the taken direction of search for the fear.Concentrating the attention on the characters I cannot forget all those outlandish accents, which didn't put the feeling of Transylvanian welcome. Disregarding this, you get the whole family of monsters and some unexpected appearances with a neat look. I am just obliged to say that here the werewolves blow my mind with their vigor, slimness and those sexy pointy ears: the best portrayal that I've ever seen.Arriving to the conclusion I am really impressed by the journey, wishing the continuation of the feast. Good and bad sides clashed like forces of light and darkness, the battle was fierce but scarred and bleeding positive part stands tall.",Van Helsing

I'm not sure what Jackman and Beckinsale thought they signed up for, but when they sat back and watched the film, after all the ""special defects"" were worked in during post-production, I'm sure they whimpered and felt as cheated as future audiences did. Besides a ho-hum storyline, the tale was plagued by clichés (including a cookie cutter sidekick that was intelligent, yet meek as well as goofy), and extraordinarily weak matte paintings and CGI. Heck, some of the CGI almost mirrored the claymation of old in its unrealistic stiffness.Most scenes, however, were drawn out to the point where they lost any hold on the viewer. Even worse, many of the human characters, no matter how much pain and suffering they endured at the hands of vampires, werewolves and such, brushed themselves off with barely a scratch and moved on.

It's all CGI nonsense with no thrill at all. Jackman is ok but Van Helsing has little to do except point gadgets in the right direction, so comes across as a poor man's Batman. Kate Beckinsale is good in a thankless role. CGI Monsters are pathetic Mr Hyde is a cross between a giant leprechaun and that fat character from Austin Powers. As for Dracula he sounded like Steve Coogans Tony Ferrino character, i would go on record as saying this is the worst Dracula i have ever seen, a pathetic performance. The Werewolf and Frankensteins monster are given nothing to do after a bright beginning that could of done with being in colour. I Loved Deep Rising, I loved The Mummy. I did'nt enjoy The Mummy Returns and this is actually worse. And for it's big budget, it was only a 1.85 ratio movie. Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein had a better plot decent laughs and more scares, watch that instead. If you must watch this wait for the dvd.

Sadly there is nothing special about this movie, but the creative action- scenes. And those are, I admit it, fun to watch.

222,miken-3,Fun and fast paced!,8,24 January 2005,"This movie has amazing special effects and borrows from a lot of the action movie directing that is currently in vogue. Jackman is very likable as a monster hunter hired by the church to eliminate all supernatural creatures and some man-made (Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein's monster).After disposing of a giant Mr. Hyde in London, Jackman is sent to Transylvania to battle the evil Count Dracula. There he meets up with a beautiful vampire slayer who is also after Dracula for turning her brother into a werewolf. However, she is reluctant to go after him because the townspeople are content to keep status quo with Dracula. Dracula and his vampire wives periodically feed on the townsfolk to satisfy their urges as long as the townsfolk don't hunt them. Any actions by the townsfolk against the vampires would result in terrible retribution.Van Helsing battles Dracula's wives who swoop and dart through the air around the town while Van Helsing is shooting a ""machine gun"" type bow and arrow. The special effects of these scenes are amazing.Later, Van Helsing does battle with Dracula with the help of a werewolf and the Frankenstein monster.We later learn that Dracula can only be killed in one way (that way is revealed late in the movie) but that way is super risky. Meanwhile Dracula is unleashing a plan to launch a vampire army to take over the world. It is up to Van Helsing, his beautiful slayer, and Frankenstein to defeat him and time is running out.A fun ride to the end.",Van Helsing
223,Sunsphxsuns,A TRIBUTE TO THE CLASSIC MONSTERS,10,6 October 2021,"I can't understand why this film doesn't receive a 10 star rating like the one I just gave it. I hope that after reading this review some IMDb reviewers may be motivated enough to give this campy film the attention and respect it rightfully deserves.Van Helsing (2004) clearly was conceived as a homage to the Universal Horror films of the 1930s and 1940s, featuring a ""near gothic"" theme that showcased classic horror monsters. With Van Helsing, these classic characters are mostly here; vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein's monster, and even Mr. Hyde.The most clever addition comes from actor Richard Roxburgh's outrageously fun portrayal of Count Dracula. If you close your eyes, Roxburgh's Dracula sounds oddly like the hilarious Ren (from the cartoon series, Ren & Stimpy) yet he retains the murderous focus of all classic vampires. Roxburgh's performance is melodrama to the highest degree. He embraces the iconic role with deep respect. His performance is laced with subtle humor and it shows in every scene.Dr. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) certainly is not the scientifically focused character you'll remember in Dracula (1931). But he is just as interesting in this version. Plus, he's far deadlier.I won't comment on Frankenstein's Monster or the Werewolf other to say you won't be disappointed in either. They have elevated these roles to spectacular heights, both physically in form, and philosophically in intellect. These ""escalated takes"" on the film's classic monster characters is what I found most intriguing. Van Helsing breaks all the rules and conceptions of the previous films quite pleasantly, making you hope there will be a sequel in the future. But alas, it was not to be. The box office results were simply too disappointing.",Van Helsing
224,I_Love_Spielberg,A very underrated Stephen Sommers film,8,23 June 2009,"""Van Helsing"" is about the famous vampire hunter in his earlier years. During this time, he is working for the Vatican, and he doesn't have any memories about his past life. His next mission, in this film, is to travel to Transylvania to kill the infamous vampire Dracula in order to prevent the Valerious family, who have been trying to vanquish Dracula for years, from slipping into purgatory. While in Transylvania, he also faces some other classic movie monsters: Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf Man. I have to say, I liked it back when I first saw it in 2004, and I still like it to this day. It's a fun movie to watch, like the ""Mummy"" movies. Hugh Jackman is really good as Van Helsing, and Kate Beckinsale is good as Anna Valerious. But the person who steals the movie is Richard Roxburgh, who plays Dracula. He really gives an interesting edge to Dracula. He not only makes him romantic, but he also makes him like Dracula is in the Bram Stoker novel...in that his goal is to make more vampires. Now, bear in mind, there are some things in this movie that could have been done better, such as the Van Helsing character himself. Sommers doesn't fully explain how Van Helsing forgets and remembers certain things from his past life. Also, you don't really care for the Van Helsing-Anna relationship that is in the movie. It's sort of one of those things that are like, ""You know...you two don't make a very good couple, so don't even try."" Other than that, it's still a good movie.",Van Helsing

A collection of images that move, look and feel computer generated, the plot, or what there is of it, seems motivated only by the ephemeral thrill of creating pretty grotesquerie. In its widely incomprehensible visualization, it serves up the basest of thrills and it does almost nothing to comment on or even penetrate a subject rife for meta-commentary. Please don't give these people any of your money.",Van Helsing
226,TerminalMadness,What a waste... *There be spoilers ahead*,3,21 October 2004,"How do you ruin four of the most timeless, scariest, and three-dimensional horror characters in history? Well, if you're Stephen Sommers you put them in a special effects-laden piece of trash like this, and then make like a politician and cop -out insisting you're a fan of these monsters, just to cover your bases and prevent criticism for directing and overseeing this chunk of cinematic sacrilege. The best about the opening of ""Van Helsing"" in theaters, you ask? Their releases of Universal's monster classics in boxed sets. Maybe it was sub-conscious guilt on part of Universal for ruining their characters.Van Helsing, my favorite literary hero of all time is resurrected for the hundredth time around ala Bruckheimer motif in this franchise wannabe called ""Van Helsing"". I've read Bram Stoker's ""Dracula"", Robert Louis Stevenson's ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"", and Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein"" in high school, all excellent books in their own level, and all metaphors in their own dimensions, but hardly is the depth and complexity present here, except their concepts, almost as if brought together by a five year old, or in this case Sommers' mentality, and the concepts are the only things on parade here. Normally, bringing together these classic horror characters would be gold for any horror fan such as myself, and I remember many a horror fan excited at the reunion of these characters, but Sommers' has single-handedly ruined the legacies people like James Whale, Tod Browning, George Waggner, and Rouben Mamoulian set forth with their loose but powerful adaptations of these literary characters, and Sommers completely misses the point of these tragic characters with a messy, hackney script.In it's concept alone ""Van Helsing"" manages to pull off the feel of an old time serial with a feeling of adventure and sheer fantasy that will leave you sitting there without having to think about the plot. It's a good time killer with its ridiculous plot line and action. It does achieve entertainment level in certain points of the film including stunning cinematography, and some really nice action sequences including the horse and carriage scene with the wolfman, and the climax where Van Helsing and Dracula throw down, the only real sequence that had me excited. Some will definitely consider it a guilty pleasure, and in many ways it is.Sommers' most heinous crime is ruining these characters with one fell swoop. This is blasphemy at its worst, and a spit in the face of every horror fan that grew up with the Universal horror films. Sommers manages to resort some of the scariest most complex three-dimensional horror figures of all time to modern mindless monsters (ala the wolfman), turns them into campy figures (ala Mr. Hyde who looks like a combination of a Shrek, an ape, and Andre the Giant), and Dracula whom sports a really corny ponytail and often has lovers' spats with his brides; and we're blessed enough to see horrifyingly bad scenes with horrid dialogue from his mates like ""You'll get another bride? Is that all we are to you?"" They also whine incessantly about their losses, including the brides who are really obnoxious, and over the top, all scenes that beg for eye rolls. Who knew Dracula was a cornball who resembled a soap opera star? Richard Roxburgh whom I liked as M in ""LXG"" is dreadful as Dracula. Where's Christopher Lee when you need him? Here Dracula looks like Antonio Banderas combined with the accent of Fernando Lamas. Oh, and in Sommers' reality, vampires don't burn up when staked, they burst into green ooze, it was something I've never seen before, and wish I hadn't.Many characters here are composites of better characters, or retreads of older characters ala Frankenstein whom is a more colorful version of Karloff's Frankenstein. Our hero Van Helsing's costume concept is a composite of The Shadow, Vampire Hunter D, and Batman, has zero personality and has dialogue that is comprised mostly of one-liners. Sommers uses the same reliable story clichés and devices such as the rogue hero under the employ of the church who has a secret organization involved with thwarting evil, and he barks that he's tired of working, they beckon him to go back and fight, blah blah. Our anti-hero is even complete with his very own ""Q"" clone named Carl (David Wenham) who is zany, whacky, a misfit, but brilliant; aren't they all? Van Helsing is a character that I was desperately trying to take a liking to, but his character, and the way he's written is so utterly uneven. One minute he's a warrior, the next a cowboy, then he's a Sherlock Holmes detective, and suddenly he can sense evil, like Spider-Man. Memo to Sommers: Just pick one concept and stick with it.Beckinsale is pretty much a clone of her ""Underworld"" character sans the fangs, charisma, and pure sex appeal, but she does manage to sport a really corny gypsy accent and is a relatively useless character. There's a highly vexing moment where Anna and Van Helsing face off against Dracula's brides in a town square, Anna is rendered helpless, but later on goes through a basic arsenal of weapons in a church... the question I ask is: why couldn't she have used those weapons in the attack? And somehow she always sports a sword but never uses it. The special effects are horrible! The figures are stiff, and grainy, often times the double exposures of the actors' faces in the creatures bodies are rigid and bland, and the morphing, though smooth, is over-used and cartoonish, and boy does Sommers love to use those special effects. Every scene in the film is comprised of eye candy more useful for people with short-attention spans and in that, Sommers manages to insult his audiences intelligence sporting non-stop special effects and never settling down to tell the story, which is completely nonsensical. At the beginning Anna and her gang are more than willing to mercilessly slaughter a werewolf but once her brother turns, she begins making excuses like ""It's not his fault"", and ""he's innocent"", and ""that body hair was already there""--well, that wasn't one of the lines, but you have to hate her for easily being able to kill an innocent stranger who's a werewolf, but pitying her brother who's a werewolf and making excuses.There are also plenty of plot holes that go on and on, I'm afraid. In the end, all Sommers has done is ruined some of my favorite characters of all time dumbing them down, his usual sense of mind-numbing action and special effects, lack of characterization, and the horrible starter to a surely terrible franchise.",Van Helsing
227,divaclv,"Campy, vampy, and entertaining",7,8 May 2004,"""Van Helsing"" is a movie that's loud, flashy, shamelessly over-the-top, and frequently silly.  And so help me, I enjoyed it.Make no mistake, this isn't something I appreciated on the level of, say, ""Lost in Translation,"" or even ""Spider-Man,"" for that matter.  There's always a bit of guilt involved when I go along with this kind of material, born of the lingering knowledge that there are more intelligent and skillful movies out there.  And yet, when Steven Sommers' adrenaline-fueled monster mash threw caution (and logic) to the wind and took off like a vampire bat-woman out of hell, I was smiling faintly, content to accept the movie for the amusement-park ride it is.The Van Helsing of the title is not the scholarly Abraham of Bram Stoker's ""Dracula,"" but adventuresome Gabriel, played by Hugh Jackman.  He's kind of a Victorian MiB agent, taking orders from a secret ecumenical order working underneath St. Peter's Basilica.  ""We have protected mankind since time immemorial,"" a cardinal intones, as he passes through a room where priests, rabbis, imams, Bhuddist monks, and assorted others work side-by-side.  Given the number of innocents who have died (and are still dying) because two or more of the represented faiths refused to get along with each other, one might suggest that they're not doing a very good job-but to borrow a phrase from Ebert, this is supplying logic where it is manifestly not wanted.  Van Helsing's mission, should he choose to accept it: go to Transylvania, hunt down Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and kill him.Riding on this is the salvation of nine generations' worth of souls from the Romany clan Valerious, who in accordance with an ancient pact cannot enter Heaven until Drac is vanquished.  The Valerious family is down to its last two scions: brother Velkan (Will Kemp), who's been bitten by a werewolf, and sister Anna (Kate Beckinsale), on whom the local vampires would like to visit a similar fate.  Dracula, meanwhile, has his own agenda, involving bringing life to his stillborn offspring via the experiments of a certain Dr. Frankenstein.  All this (and more) makes for a very crowded movie, and the story winds up not unlike Frankenstein's ultimate project: the parts don't fit together seamlessly, but as a whole it manages to work-most of the time.With decent F/X and excellent settings (which look like they sprung from the collective imaginations of Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, and Edgar Allan Poe), ""Van Helsing"" is a handsome film visually.  Speaking of handsome, Jackman cuts a fine figure in the lead role and, while the script doesn't always give him a whole lot to work with, he works well with what he's given.  His Van Helsing covers much of the same ground as Wolverine (both characters are lone warriors with large gaps in their memory) but does so with a soberer, more conscientious bent.  David Wenham has fun (and is fun to watch) in the sidekick role, a friar of strong intelligence and questionable spirituality. On the monster side of things, Shuler Hensley does the best work as Frankenstein's creation, a not-so-gentle giant who ends up being an unlikely ally for the heroes.  But while Roxburgh looks good as a seedily aristocratic Dracula, his performance could have done with a bit more menace and a lot less scenery-chewing.  I'm inclined to blame Sommers for this, since Roxburgh is somewhat effective in his more restrained moments-there's a nice bit where he attempts to seduce Anna at a masked ball-and in any case, it's still a step or two up from Gerard Butler's lifeless portrayal in `Dracula 2000.'`Van Helsing' starts off strong, with a gorgeous black-and-white prologue, and has enough good action sequences to keep things moving.  Only towards the end of its two-and-a-quarter hours running time does it begin to lose steam.  But well before then, most audience members will have decided to go along for the ride, or opt out altogether.  I chose the former, and had fun-but others may do as they see fit.",Van Helsing
228,Teknofobe70,Not as bad as they say ...,6,6 April 2005,"Partly because I'd heard in so many reviews that this movie was awful, and party just because it was one of the biggest flops of the year, I didn't have very high expectations of this one. Perhaps that's why I enjoyed it so damn much.This movie follows the story of Doctor Gabriel Van Helsing, who we all know from Bram Stoker's Dracula as an ageing professor who takes on the evil count. Here, however, he is a young and handsome demon hunter / acrobatics expert with an array of cool weapons. In the opening scene of the movie we see Doctor Frankenstein, under the supervision of Dracula, bringing his monster to life while the torch-wielding peasants are already storming his castle. Meanwhile, Van Helsing takes on Mr Hyde in the Notre Dame Cathedral. These scenes pretty much set the tone of the whole thing. The plot has absolutely no internal consistency, but when the film looks this good, how much does it really matter? ... yes, it's stupid, but if you can get in the right frame of mind it can also be a lot of fun.The acting unfortunately isn't that great ... Hugh Jackman isn't really given a whole lot to work with as far as his Van Helsing character is concerned, and for the most part he simply gives his 'Wolverine' performance all over again, especially towards the end. Kate Beckinsale is a fine actress and has the perfect face for Gothic horror, as best shown in Underworld, but here with her silly Transylvanian accent and looking like Catherine Zeta Jones, it just doesn't work. Probably the most memorable performance comes from David 'Faramir' Wenham, who provides most of the comic relief as Van Helsing's bible-bashing sidekick.In terms of special effects it's pretty amazing -- this movie did, after all, have a ludicrous amount of money thrown at it ($160 million), but perhaps relying so heavily on CGI was a mistake. Many directors have said that if an effect can be achieved physically, often that's the best route to take. And here, the computer-generated stuff is at times very distracting as rather than being involved in the plot you're sitting there thinking, ""Oo, doesn't that creature look good?"" The soundtrack is also very cool (even the bits stolen from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"").It's unfortunate that this wasn't the box-office hit it was clearly intended to be, but if you're in the mood for a big, stupid, fun action movie that makes no sense and has absolutely no point to it, this one is as good as any.",Van Helsing
229,Mr_PCM,2 hours of mindless fun,8,15 April 2005,"Van Helsing is one of those films which most people will either really enjoy, or really enjoy ripping to shreds. If you are a person who sees films as something to be taken seriously, then stay away. If however you go to the cinema or rent a DVD simply for entertainment, then this is ideal.Director Stephen Sommers, with the Mummy films already under his belt, has produced a ridiculous but fun homage to early Universal classic horror films Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman. Calling it tongue-in-cheek would be a dramatic under-statement. The story is rather convoluted, but then it would take something original to fit all three of those Hollywood horror icons effectively into one story. But by never taking itself too seriously it largely side-steps any serious criticism of its' plot.Hugh Jackman revels in the Indiana Jones-esquire title role, which is a far cry from the Abraham Van Helsing of Bram Stoker's book (for one thing, he's a lot younger now with a different name!) and something else which is bound to infuriate the killjoys. Oops, sorry, I of course meant purists. Kate Beckinsale vamps it up again (almost literally) effectively reworking her role from Underworld, but her passion for the role seems to become lost under her heavy-handed Romanian accent. David Wenham though is a revelation in the role of Karl, Van Helsing's assistant, showing an impeccable sense of comic timing. Admittedly the lines are frequently horrendously corny, but that is part of the fun. Robbie Coltrane also has an excellent cameo as Mr Hyde early in the film. The only real criticism that can be levelled at the casting is Richard Roxborough's mis-casting as Dracula - the menace simply is not there, and he is more camp than count. Sesame Street's Dracula had more menace!But with excellent special effects (too often going unappreciated in this modern technological age) and a simple but fun story, this film is a perfect popcorn movie for a Saturday night. Just remember not to think too much!",Van Helsing
230,misbegotten,"Curse you, Steven Sommers!",4,26 October 2005,"I can't say, hand on heart, that Van Helsing is a good movie. However, it's not a total disaster either. It's one of those films that exists in the grey area in-between, alongside the not bad, the okay, the passable.Van Helsing finds writer and director Steven Sommers locked into the one-damn-thing-after-another type narrative that he displayed in the dreadful The Mummy Returns, and while Van Helsing never quite stoops to the depths of that movie, you do wish that Sommers would realise that visual spectacle and constant events are insufficient substitutes for a decent story and characterisation.Sommers's script has several major weaknesses. First, despite all the pre-release hype about this movie featuring Dracula, Frankenstein plus his Monster, and the Wolf Man, in actuality the latter creature does not appear. Universal's Wolf Man was Lawrence Talbot, played by Lon Chaney Junior in five movies during the 40s (the character also turned up in a Lovecraftian graphic novel written a few years ago by Neil Gaiman). There are several werewolves in Van Helsing, but none of them are Talbot. Sorry if it seems I'm being a bit nit-picky about this, but it's like going to see a James Bond movie only to find that the hero isn't 007 but a stand-in called Ken Smith. It's just not the same.As for those aforementioned werewolves, there isn't any real reason for either them or Frankenstein's Monster to be in the movie. They do actually turn out to be of vital importance to the story, but only because Sommers's script is so contrived. I get the impression he was hellbent on cramming as many monsters as he could into this film, and came up with any reason he could to explain their presence in the story, no matter how half-baked. The result is that Frankenstein's Creature and the werewolves can't even be considered proper characters in this movie - they're just walking plot devices.In fact, the entire film is full of such plot devices. Time and again, characters display certain abilities, suddenly know important information, or are revealed to be in possession of something vital to the story, and the why, how, or where of any of it is never addressed. We're just supposed to take it as read. Sommers seems to assume that as long as something is pushing the story forward, then it doesn't need explaining.The movie contains almost non-stop CGI (no surprises there), but this isn't quite as annoying as I thought it would be. The Mr. Hyde that Van Helsing battles at the beginning of the film is surprisingly passable, with gorilla-like swinging movements that emphasise Hyde's primeval nature. In fact there's so much swinging from ropes and cables in this movie that Sommers could use it as a show reel to audition for the job of directing future Spider Man sequels or Tarzan flicks. As for the cast, Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale struggle to do much with their extremely underwritten characters. Their roles can be summed up in a single sentence each: Van Helsing (Jackman) is brave, fights monsters, and can't remember his past. Anna Valerious (Beckinsale) is brave, fights monsters, and is the last of her gypsy/warrior bloodline. And that's it.Some reviewers have criticised Robert Roxburgh's performance as Dracula, but personally I thought he was fine. That said, the character was lacking something, but I can't decide if that's due to Roxburgh or the script: both Dracula and his grand scheme never really feel like much of a threat (unlike Roxburgh's Moriarty in the under-rated League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, who seemed quite capable of conquering the world).I've always thought that the Three Brides were one of the most interesting aspects of the Dracula story, sadly overlooked in the majority of movies featuring the Count. Therefore I'm pleased to report that the Brides get more screen time here than in any other Dracula film I can think of (with the notable exception of Dracula 2000). However, having cast three truly stunning, gorgeous & beautiful actresses as the Brides, Sommers inexplicably succumbs to his CGI addiction and has the characters portrayed by computer generated winged harpies most of the time. It's a crime against nature (Just ask Roxburgh: he's gotten engaged to one of the Brides. Now that's method acting.).Amongst the rest of the supporting cast, David Wenham shines as Van Helsing's sidekick, and gets the film's best (only?) catchphrase: ""I'm not a monk. I'm a friar."" Meanwhile, Kevin O'Connor - a regular fixture in Sommers movies - plays Dracula's turncoat henchman Igor, but is hampered by unconvincing latex makeup. Van Helsing contains all the usual flaws that we've come to expect in a Sommers movie - or any modern big budget Hollywood movie, come to that. But it's reasonably entertaining, and these days we tend to take from these kinds of studio movies any crumbs that we can. It's just a shame that we have to satisfy ourselves with such meagre offerings.",Van Helsing

There are a few decent scenes, that is, scenes that show some creativity and actually have something like a plan behind their execution. Mostly, however, it's just one disconnected action scene after another.There's no real story. Or maybe there is a story but it got put aside to focus on displaying the dark, damp and brooding-Gothic sets. It all looks like some teenager's heavy metal fantasy.Overall it lacks any sense of drama. There's no pacing. The script is right out of a soap opera. The acting is pathetic. Beckinsale is about the same as she was in ""Underworld"" - dark clothes, long pauses with meaningful looks, and as much posturing as she can fit in.Early on they walk into Dracula's castle - they see it off in the distance and walk through a woods. For the rest of the movie they work on unraveling a mystery involving a torn scroll, hidden passages, secret doors, passwords, a magic ring, etc. With much effort they unravel the mystery and are able to get into Dracula's castle - the same one they'd walked over to earlier.Most of the characters look and sound alike with heavy middle-European accents. Except Jackman, who delivers his lines with modern sarcasm.David Wenham does a nice job. As does Robbie Coltrane - although it's only his voice. Richard Roxburgh is a fair Dracula.The movie steals from numerous other movies: Jackman has several Batman tools; he works for a secret organization and has a Q designing gadgets for him; refs to earlier Dracula-Werewolf movies are all over.Frankenstein is in it of course. If you remember the original legend: Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker were working on a stage adaptation of ""The King and I"" when William Morris stopped by with a new wallpaper design and suggested a combo creation ""Frankula"".Go see ""Blade"" and ""Dracula 2000"" if you like this kind of thing.",Van Helsing
233,thousandisland,"Proudly in the ""Liked It"" Camp !",7,11 May 2004,"NO SPOILERS. NONE !! Charge forth !! I was pretty sure (nay, *positive*) that I was going to hate this one. Well, it's another CGI Action movie (budget was over $150 mil, so you know what's coming), as has become the trend recently, and I generally hate those. This one would be a flop without Hugh Jackman, but thankfully he's here and looking better than ever, and playing something like a shallow version of Wolverine. The movie is an aggregate of several types: A vampire movie, an action movie, a classic monster movie, and an Eye Candy movie that totally delivers. MOST of the effects are pretty good - only a handful miss the mark, and Jackman, well... He is the Ultimate Eye Candy, especially when clad in Turn of the Century romanticism. The female viewers will surely be satisfied (no complaints here on the detailed leather costumes, glittering weapons, and flowing black cloaks!) and the vampire people and action movie buffs will get their fill, too.Some aspects of it are annoying, like the constant use of computer effects, unfortunately at the expense of dialogue and character development. And that strangling outfit Beckinsale wears is ugly and eventually irritating to look at. Some of the dialogue is a little ""off,"" too, but I guess that's to be expected in this type of flick. Where you'd expect it to crash, 'Van Helsing' does provide a detailed and almost believable plot that gives the monsters credible reason to interact. There were a few times during the screening I attended when you could hear people muttering worried ""Oh no""s at the key points of the story; the thing was pretty darn involving, perhaps disturbingly so.It was obvious that some explanatory scenes had been sharply cut (unfortunately), but the film was coherent and tended to answer its various questions as it went along. It was nice to see the characters and the audience simultaneously confused over certain plot elements, and then learn the reasons together. Most of all, 'Van Helsing' could have been helped by fewer effects and much more dialogue. And as others have mentioned, it goes too far toward making the main characters invincible. Part of a great action movie is a great hero (and a beautiful co-star and a bumbling sidekick, of course), but that relies on his being human enough to fail sometimes and feel pain, or at least lie on the ground for a while after he's taken such a pummeling. Maybe that is the distance between Van Helsing and Wolverine.Overall, this was a terrific, guilty pleasure, even for someone who isn't into monster flicks. Go for the antiquity, the scenery, the incredible costumes and cool weaponry, and an awesome Dracula, too!Score: A solid ""B,"" for doing what it sets out to do.",Van Helsing
234,suessis,Dark and well...Dark,4,14 December 2004,"I learned early on in my enjoyment of Stephen Sommers' work that it is not to be taken seriously, but that you were to sit back and enjoy the ride. I did this with ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" and certainly had a great time (The less said about ""The Scorpion King"" the better).""Van Helsing"", however, is an entirely different story. OK, I went into this not taking it seriously, but this film was beyond ridiculous at times. I am dying to know where the witty and energetic dialog of ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" went. Except on the odd occasion, I can't find it in this script. Also, there are events in the film that seem totally implausible. (Such as - how could Frankenstein's monster have such an adult depth of understanding about the world and about who he is so quickly after his creation)Besides that the actors in this movie sometimes ham it up to the max. Roxburgh in particular in his portrayal of Dracula was so over the top at some points that I wanted to smack him. There was also something about him that did not register quite as the sexy vampire that can lure women to their doom. Maybe it was that strange nose of his that kept drawing my attention in every scene he was in.I would like to tell you that there was some great special effects in this film. There usually are in a Stephen Sommers film, but I couldn't see them given the fact that the screen was so dark half the time. There was very little color or light in this film, and it only added to my general feeling of dislike.Mr. Sommers, I could tell by the ending that you were thinking ""sequel"" in your brain. May I suggest that you try a new idea instead.",Van Helsing
235,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Van Helsing,7,7 May 2004,"Another summer season has come upon us at the box office with many major releases opening within its first few weeks all in an effort to gather as much coinage as they possibly can before Spider-Man 2 steamrolls its way into theaters. Anything after that film better be pretty damn good to compete with it but that is another topic for another day. Prior to 1999 the summer season kicked off around Memorial Day weekend as children began to slowly be released from schools across the country but that was before The Mummy opened to $43 million the weekend of May 7th, 1999, which, in effect, changed the way studios dealt with the summer heat. In the two years that followed, both Gladiator (2000) and The Mummy Returns (2001) opened on the first weekend of May to fantastic numbers but that never became the official kick-off point for the summer until Spider-Man sealed the deal in 2002, opening to $115 million its opening weekend. Universal studios doesn't expect that much with the opening of Van Helsing but they do expect a decent return as it is not often that they shell out $160 million (and then some) for one film especially in the current situation they are in with their new parent company. But considering Stephen Sommers, the same man who directed The Mummy and its sequel, is at that reins, there's a sure bet the cult followers will be out in droves once again.The story follows the adventures a man sent by a secret society to go out into the world to vanquish evil creatures such as the Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster, and Dracula and stop their reins of terror on humanity. Van Helsing is known throughout most of Europe, either as a holy man or as a murderer, but the man behind God's work has no memory of who he is or where he comes from. All he knows is that he is in the service of the Catholic Church sent to different parts of the world to stop evil in the form of monsters and demons. There's nothing in the job description about being well liked by the people he is trying to protect. His latest assignment is to travel to Transylvania to destroy the powerful Count Dracula while at the same time protect Anna Valerious, the last of her family's lineage who had sworn to do anything in their power to destroy Dracula and end his rein of terror. But Dracula has a plan of his own  he devises a course of action in using Frankenstein's monster as well as the Wolfman in his efforts to raise up a force of bat-like children to rule over humanity with fear and terror. There's only one man who stands in his way, who has the force of God on his side: Van Helsing. The story for Van Helsing is hard to really grasp but not in the sense you would think. The film isn't a real puzzler or anything of that nature (Good vs. Evil  not much to figure out here) but one does have to have a tolerance for campy action flicks or else this will be a complete waste of time. Though the film is clichéd at moments, surprisingly it wasn't so much as was to be expected, if that helps at all to those who disliked The Mummy films.No one may actually be going into this film for the sole purpose of seeing any particular star within it, which is probably the reason why there are only two (one if you want to get into specifics) big names in the cast, but none the less the cast of Van Helsing offers some decent performances, nothing Oscar caliber by any means, while at the same presenting several prominent disappointments. Hugh Jackman, who is best known for his performance of Wolverine in the X-Men film series, gives an engaging performance as Abraham Van Helsing, though no where near the one given by Sir Anthony Hopkins in Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was to be expected. The only problem lies with the character itself as the script starts off with many questions and yet answers very few of the them by the end, which could or could not point to a possible sequel in the works. Kate Beckinsale, who hasn't been able to make a name for her self in the sense of truly carrying a film on her name alone just yet, works with what is given to her as best she can but there really isn't much emotional attachment with the character to be really all that concerned for what happens to her within the course of the film. Though it was Sommer's intent on resurrecting (in a sense) interest in Dracula, the vision seems to be lost with Richard Roxburgh's go around as he is way too over-the-top in a way that's laughable at times and, at times, confusing. The same would have to go for Dracula's Brides played Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran, who become so irritating in their performances that the audience will be applauding at their demises, and not for the reasons they should be doing so.Overall, Van Helsing kicks off the 2004 summer box office with more of a whimper then a driving force and only shatters the hopes of those who were awaiting an enthusiastic kick-off as had always been accustomed in the past. As with Hellboy, Van Helsing falls into the category of films that doesn't leave you clamoring to see it again nor is it a feature that you would detest repeating, if it were presented to you again. The first third of the film (dividing the film into three parts) was quite exciting, mysterious, and filled with wall-to-wall action, which makes the other two thirds of the film all the more disappointing. There is nothing as bad as a film that sets you up for quality entertainment only to knock you down with a weak follow-through. The problem lies with the script itself which becomes too bogged down with numerous plot lines and character aspects and quickly deteriorates into a mundane and repetitive camp film. There's nothing wrong with camp films as long as they are done right, which isn't the case with Van Helsing. Another issue that was clearly prominent throughout the film was the blatant over-use of CGI effects, which often looked fake, no more so then in the scene where the Wolfman jumps across the fire on the wagon toward Van Helsing or the transformation of Dracula, which just looked ridiculous. And there was a small problem the musical score, which, every so often, sounded too familiar to the score for The Mummy, but nothing major to complain about. There are three types of people who will be disappointed by this film: fans of the classic novel (and film) Dracula, those who fell for the hype, and all others who aren't just entertained by a few mere explosions and boobs flashed on the screen. Van Helsing will surely go down as one of the bigger disappointments of the summer season.My Rating: *** ½ out of 5 (Grade: C+)",Van Helsing
236,alexfromhorn,"Story is lame, too much effects, ridicules mythology.. maybe nice for children..",4,15 August 2009,"I think this movie was quite miserable because:The story was lame, predictable and sometime really melodramatic. The actor choice for Dracula was bad, Dracula can't look or behave that way. And the big problem I have about this movie that it completely ridicules mythology: I know a lot about mythology and old horror classics and I would study it if it was possible and I can say that this movie had a lot of mistakes. Like that you need silver against Vampires -> no you need wood, silver is against werewolves and Vampires can't transform into harpies or walk on walls or make children, this is just ridiculous to me... and that were just 3 examples out of maaaany... Also what I didn't like was the huge number of special effects... there weren't so much scenes without them ... and these effect weren't done really well ... not for a 2004 movie.The tension was almost on the same level for the whole movie.. lowand also Bram Stoker's idea of the character van Helsing gets completely ridiculed because in the original he was just an old Doctor who found out what Count Dracula was and how to kill him..... And now people will think of van Helsing as some kind of comic-style Vampire Hunter... What was good: Hugh Jackman, though for the first minutes I couldn't stop laughing over his hair.... They brought in a lot of known characters: Werewolves, Vampires, Mr Hyde, Frankenstein ""Igor"".... but this also might count as a minus point cause it's really too much....It could be a movie for children from 9-13... but all other people shouldn't watch this...",Van Helsing
237,FilmFan777,Dissapointing...Not worth the wait,4,7 May 2004,"Some things taste better a bit over cooked. However in this case, Van Helsing 2004 tasted like a burnt bruquette.All the special effects in the world or the best book cover design wont make a good story. It's the content that grabs you at the end of the day and Van Helsing seemed to forget that. No character depth and too many unbelievable holes in the story took this very promising film and turned it into a big turkey. I was so looking forward to if for the idea of the film as well as being a Hugh Jackman fan. However, the director/writer put too much faith in wrapping then he did in content and, what a shame. You might be mildly entertained by 'some' of the decent special effects (or nearly drowned by them)however you'll likely find yourself running out of breath due the pace, or in need of a real meal to fill that empty thing we call, connection and believability.",Van Helsing
238,benjaminwest-242,A decent film at best,4,6 November 2021,"Van Helsing has a thrilling premise, but ultimately fails. The acting is somewhat good, but at times is wholly unconvincing due to odd dialogue and illogical plot points. Emotionally the film does not deliver, with mostly negligible relations between the characters that feel forced. The storyline has interesting characters, but together they do not work well, written together in a jumbled and simply ridiculous plot. The CGI is average. Character development is the highlight, with smart comedic choices and alright action sequences that somewhat counteract the otherwise unfulfilling presentation. The conclusion is particularly unsatisfactory. Overall, a feature barely worth viewing.",Van Helsing

Entertaining from start to finish, and looks spectacular. Amazingly beautiful effects and cinematography. Excellent camera work - I loved the way the camera is not silky smooth, but has very subtle imperfections and roughness which adds to the authenticity of the CGI.Some of the effects are not good, such as when the characters jump around unnaturally like cartoon characters. This is still a problem in 3d character effects - the movement looks too fake.

240,seveb-25179,Van-tastic!,7,5 October 2018,"Hugh Jackman in Wolverine-esque mode pre X-Men. He's the vampire slayer Van Helsing transformed, in lurid modern day comic book style, into a superhero, and by the end of the movie he has become a werewolf to boot!
He warms up by fighting a very Shrek-like ""Mr Hyde"" voiced by Robbie Coltrane, who doesn't have to fake a Scottish accent, before moving on to encounter Dracula, Igor, Frankenstein, a Werewolf and Dracula's three Brides.
Leave any treasured memories of the traditional stories you may have at the door, as they have been cannibalised and rearranged almost beyond recognition.
I find this movie very attractive visually, I think the set design, effects and action sequences were very well conceived and executed. The basic story structure is sound enough for me, and all the actors to a fine job.
However they just try to cram in too much action, which comes at the expense of any meaningful character development, and much of the dialogue is disappointing.
I think this could have been a classic, but instead it ends up being another movie that feels like a video arcade game.",Van Helsing
241,maeander,"It seems hard to believe, but Abbott & Costello did it better.",3,2 January 2005,"It's not funny. It's not a spoof. It's not scary. They tried to make Indiana Jones meets Ghostbusters meets James Bond meets The Hulk. They missed on all counts.Most of the action/set special effects are good. The character special effects, with the exception of Dracula's Brides and the Frankenstien monster, are not. The werewolves and Mr. Hyde are REALLY bad. The characters in Shrek are more believable than these CGI characters. This especially affects the final battle between the werewolf and the vampire. Where is the tension and drama when the biggest stunts are done by animated characters? The scripted is convoluted and silly. With a strong overlay of religion (Van Helsing is an agent of the Pope in Rome), the absurdity just continues.Hugh Jackman is an enjoyable actor. He brings a great deal of likability to his part. Kate Bekinsale and Richard Roxburgh are not very good. Their accents are terrible. They have no screen presence. And why is Ms. Beckinsale wearing her corset outside of her clothing? Lon Chaney Jr. originated the part of the werewolf on film. Bela Lugosi originated the part of Dracula on film. In fact, he only appeared twice on film in the part. The first ""Dracula"" (1931) and the second time in ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein""(1948). After viewing Van Helsing, you come to appreciate the pure honesty of Chaney's and Lugosi's performances.It's hard to believe, but ""Abbott & Costello meets Frankenstein"" did a better job in bringing Universal Picture's main monster together in one film than ""Van Helsing"" did. And A&B even threw in the Invisible man.",Van Helsing
242,moonmonday,"Elements of Good, Execution Completely Lacking",2,4 July 2009,"I am probably different from many in that my first exposure to Van Helsing was in the animation The London Assignment. It was a steal, so I picked it up and gave it a watch, with low expectations. But I found myself interested, so I thought I would finally watch the film that spawned the animated prequel.It is rather astonishing to me, actually, how a 30-minute tie-in prequel could be so many leagues superior to its big-budget Hollywood source material, especially when there is so much rich material to draw from. Then again, that may have been the chiefest problem: whereas The London Assignment focused solely on a single adversary, the film tries to incorporate so many things and so many moments of homage that it never finds a focus.The first and most inexcusable aspect is that none of the protagonists are even remotely sympathetic or enjoyable, and no real effort is made to convince the viewer that their plight is good, just, or correct. When the inevitable betrayal comes later, it is not unexpected, but it also fails to carry any emotional weight whatsoever. There is really no effort put into a setup or premise, which makes the film's narrative extremely weak. If the viewers don't care anything about the supposed heroes, why should they care if they fall into danger? The mindset of 'monsters are evil and should be destroyed' was weak in the 50s, that golden age of monsters and aliens in film, and it certainly has not weathered the half-century after. Just as Van Helsing and his crew are not sufficiently heroic or sympathetic, Dracula and his are not sufficiently villainous or unsympathetic. If anything, because of the willful ignorance and hatefulness of the villagers, the Frankenstein Monster makes a compelling argument against the supposed 'heroes'...which is another moment where the film falls flat when it is supposed to have a more emotional impact.When the heroes meet with hardship, why should we care? They have already caused great torment and sadness for the supposed villains, and for no legitimate or justified reason. It also rather presumptuously sets forth that this bizarre melange of beliefs promoted by the 'holy knights' in the Vatican are entirely true and right, which is a bit much to take for granted, especially with a diverse audience.Honestly, few of the performances are bad in this film. This is a fantastic cast, and Hugh Jackman does the best with his very weakly-written role. It doesn't hurt that he's particularly nice to look at, but good looks and acting talent cannot help a disastrously poor script and questionable direction; it has been mentioned before, and accurately, that Van Helsing is essentially a series of action sequences barely strung together by the faintest hints of plot.The characters should have been more defined, and then we might have a reason to care about them, or at least to be concerned if one will survive the current encounter. With a running time of over two hours total, many superfluous and needless scenes could have been eschewed in favor of some modicum of character development. That this is the same man responsible for the generally enjoyable Mummy revival series is shocking to me, since those films were such a considerable step up from Van Helsing.CG special effects were also, as elsewhere noted, grossly abused in this. While they were quite good, they were overused and made the whole affair look too dependent upon the effects, rather than the proceedings being augmented by them. Any longtime horror aficionado will tell you, it isn't the effects, it's the atmosphere. And even though Van Helsing was not really a horror film -- more an action movie with Gothic horror elements -- it lacked on so many counts, ambiance included.Essentially it was as if someone had thrown a bunch of well-known features of well-known horror or supernatural figures and roughly blended them to create a film. The plot only moved by grace of the script, not through logical progression or narrative development, and it constantly contradicted itself. The characters were bland at best, despicable at worse...and those were the heroes. The villains at least had centuries of literary heritage behind them. But the heroes were unsympathetic automatons, spewing rhetoric that was clear the actors did not share in conviction. Still, the antagonists were not nearly convincing enough in their opposition and managed to make little impression themselves.All in all, this was a work of wasted potential. Too many irons in the fire made this a chaotic mess that rarely made any sense and never managed to be as compelling as it should have been. How is it possible that a 30-minute animated video tie-in got it right, but the 2-hour-plus Hollywood blockbuster fumbled it so badly? If you really want to give this concept a try, watch The London Assignment and give this a skip. It's just not worth losing two hours of your life that you will never get back. There are so many more deserving films out there.",Van Helsing

You seen everything here before done much much better.  The actors seem as if they are mailing in their performances. And that crap with the Friar and tying him into Q from James Bond almost made me want to leave the theater.  I've seen Van Helsing played better by older men with less effect and no modern weapons.  Obvious the blame is squarely on Sommers.  All he did was took his shell from The Mummy and inserted different characters.  He had no idea what to do with his leading lady and his leading man, as the same with the Mummy, is just trying to be a weaker version of Indiana Jones.  You will recognize all sorts of films in this movie: Mask of Zorro, The Mummy, Underworld (with all the blue in the movie), James Bond, Indiana Jones.  It's just a formula film whose formula needs to be retired.  There is absolutely no passion in this film.  No risk taking, nothing that WOWS you.

Yes, they were dumb, but they were a whole lot of fun.I wasn't aware that it was Sommers who directed Van Helsing until the end credits, and I have to say that I just don't get him.You have a semi-homage to the classic Universal horror movies, mainly Frankenstein, Dracula and The Wolf Man, still, it's all jumbled up into something that wants to pass as plot, that I don't fully understand no matter how many times I see it.Abraham Van Helsing, the vampires scholar, is turned into Gabriel Van Helsing, sort of a James Bond/Batman from Transylvania, with all kinds of gadgets and technology that I doubt existed by that time.The movie starts sort of sci-fi with the thinnest and most insulting homage to Frankenstein at the beginning, then has more of an action tone with Van Helsing's fight against Mr. Hyde, and halfway through involves a Gothic (and graphic) horror style that becomes confusing. It has some comic relief mixed with creepy and disturbing CGI morphing sequences, including multiple werewolf transformations, and also spectacular stunts.There is some sort of back story involving a family's quest to kill Dracula, and Gabriel's past, but it sounds too epic to be an action flick.All of this makes me wonder, what the hell is this? Action? Horror? Comedy? Camp? The musical score by Alan Silvestri is quite amusing and exciting (and brief in CD) as it seems to be the only coherent aspect of this troubled production.Overall, the movie is indeed fun and somehow watchable, except for the previously mentioned transformation scenes and too many vampire jaws opening longer than physically possible (something we already saw in lesser extent in ""The Mummy"").

Okay back to my review. This movie was good for what it was. The vampire brides were sexy. HOT!  The action scenes were good. I was glad that didn't go for the whole Matrix special effects thing. It was a good use of wires and explosions in this movie.I give this movie a 6. This is the first time that I have been stumped on reviewing a movie.  Go see it and you tell me what you thought!Ha ha",Van Helsing
252,Juan_from_Bogota,"Beautiful Vampire Brides! Great Action, Great Movie!",9,8 May 2007,"I really liked this film, i was impressed with the special effects, the costumes, the incredibly great story behind Van Helsig character, performed excellent by Hugh Jackman and the great other horror characters: Dracula (incredible), Frankestein is great, but the ones that really i loved were the vampire brides, wow! beautiful, gorgeous charming, just spectacular, and totally terrifying and horrible as vampires, i just wanted to be Dracula in that movie! he was the hero to me!. After this the deploy of the movie kept me amazed, of how an incredible film can manage all these terrifying monsters and still being a great film!: (1) Dr. Jekyll/Mr Hyde, (2) The Wolfman, (3) Frankestein (4) Dracula (5,6 and 7) The Vampire Brides (8) Igor, etc etc. The heroes are just like comic book heroes, but excellent; Van Helsing as the left hand of God and protected by church is just a great new era of the Crusades. Excellent! ABOUT THE FILM: Hugh Jackman plays here Van Helsig, a Vatican detective, not very popular, who served to God finding and destroying the worst evil in the world, he followed instructions from The Vatican, and his skills were afraid by all the monsters. After he fought against Mr. Hyde, he was put on a special mission in order to destroy the evil Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), he then goes with his assistant Carl (David Wenham) to Transilvania and meet the Valerious family, who where trying to kill the monster 400 years ago, the only female survival was Anna Valerious (Kate Backinsale) who joined Van Helsing in his mission. They faced a great threat trying to kill this monster in which get involve also powerful fiery Wolfmen, Frankestein monster, more vampires (including terrible brides of Dracula), huge castles and more.For this incredible ride i give 9 out of 10, great work of Stephen Sommers! !",Van Helsing
253,fritzlang,Under appreciated fun,8,2 June 2004,"Just came back from seeing this film.  What a blast!  I really don't know what all the critics were complaining about.  Stephen Sommers set out to create an action packed, roller coaster big budget fantasy film with all kinds of creatures, 'cool' special effects, funny lines, and a fun popcorn film.  I think he has succeeded.Visually, the film is brilliant.  The sets and photography were always fascinating.  And I was never bored for one minute.Yes, the plot has tons of holes in it - though I found what was there actually entertaining and the few plot twists I thought were actually interesting.  The characters were 2 dimensional.  But who in the world goes to see these kind of films for rich character and plot development?This film is more of a comedy and satire than a horror film.  Those looking to be scared out of their wits will be very disappointed (though there was at least one scene that made me jump). However, I saw this more in the vein of a modernized ""Abbot & Costello meets Frankenstein"" than anything else. Mr. Sommers also does some great toung-in-cheek fun of Indiana Jones, Star Wars (love those Ewoks!), Alien, Batman, Gremlins, with some very funny lines.  I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard.  And yes, I think these laughs were intentional.  Those who think this is MSK3000 material is missing the humor that is inherent in this film.In regards to the creatures themselves..Well, I personally found the CGI Mr. Hyde infinitely better than last years Hulk (and funnier too).  I mean, the film opens up with you seeing Mr. Hyde's drawers falling down and you see his butt!  How can anyone think this film was meant to be serious?The Frankenstein monster was more inspired by Mary Shelly's creature than Karloff's (even the ending was straight out of her book).  And Dracula was an over-the-top satire of Gary Oldman's Dracula from Francis Ford Coppola's version. The Brides were an over the top satire of the Hammer films. The Wolfman was really a nod to the Howling.  So ironically, while this is a Universal film, the creatures pay more homage/satire of other studios.Yet some of the scenes of the film were straight out of the 30's Universal franchises.  The carriages running through the night.  The mob of villagers storming Castle Frankenstein, etc.  At least I appreciated what Mr. Sommers was trying to accomplish.I even found the closing credits to be entertaining! (Don't know the last time I could say that).Yes, one can argue that we have had enough of 'leave your brain at the door' CGI based action films.  And I don't honestly know the replay value of this film.  But if you can go in with the right attitude, you can have a very fun 2 hour ride.",Van Helsing
254,rose-294,Surprisingly enjoyable,8,3 June 2008,"First, when I read an Empire article, I almost cried. Another Underworld? CGI overkill with the photography through the blue, grey or sickly green filter? The positive tone of that sleazy rag did not really help, either. I mean, USUALLY I avoid the filthy perversions of human flies... err, critics and movie magazine journalists like a John Waters movie, but hey, this was an article of a monster mash, so how could I resist not to buy the rag? Anyway, after seeing the movie I found my fears unwarranted - despite the plot less action, all the CGI, awful cooler-than-thou nods to James Bond (movies I hate) and Kate Beckinsale's strrrong woman I found this Universal homage surprisingly enjoyable. The fairy-tale version of ""late 19th century Tränsylveinia"", a place of the aristocratically evil vampires, sinister castles, moonlit forests, the werewolves and Frankenstein's monster, won me over. The gorgeously dressed vampire brides were especially fun, managing to steal the whole show with their looks and fun attitude. The only good Stephen Sommers film.",Van Helsing
255,Juni78ukr,Typical summer blockbuster with colossal budget and numerous flaws,6,7 May 2004,"I have seen Van Helsing today in premiere screening and I have found this movie just okay, but I never expect too much from most of summer blockbusters. If you really want to enjoy this summer flick you should leave your brains at home and don't think about acting, plot holes, logical mistakes and other such things. Visual and sound effects were very good, while fight scenes looked pretty dynamic and well made. Computer-generated creatures were exciting and looked almost real. But leave the technical part and computer-generated visuals alone and let's face the most problem parts: the script and acting. Sometimes I have a terrible feeling that something's going wrong with Hollywood screenwriters. Most of recent movies I have seen had so lame script and Van Helsing don't make an exception. You can find here all typical flaws: bad character development, very weak supporting characters, weak and silly dialogs as well as lack of ordinary logic. You know that acting is the weakest point of such high-budgeted summer movies, so don't expect anything great here. Hugh Jackman, who was very good in X-2, this time showed inability to carry movie alone. Cate Beckinsale was miserable as lead female character. Richard Roxburgh as a main villain was too wooden and unemotional. David Wenham (guy who played Faramir in LoTR) definitely deserved something better than such pitiful and mostly unfunny part of superhero's friend and assistant. It looks like they were trying to create character of some kind of cool but awkward guy (like Jonathan in Mummy and Mummy Returns) but they were also wrong here. But despite all numerous flaws nevertheless it's entertained and even enjoyable movie, mostly because it never pretended to be a serious movie. And because of that reason I think it don't worse than much more successful Spider-man 2 and I, Robot which pretended to be something more solid and easily failed there. Overall, Van Helsing is average summer blockbuster, that is worth for watching once but don't expect anything great and memorable here. For Stephen Sommers this movie is another step down after his much more entertained and pleasant Mummy movies.My grade 5.9 out of 10",Van Helsing
256,rbsjrx,"Not bad, despite what's being said",8,7 May 2004,"The early reviews for this are all over the map, with lots of pans. I frankly don't get it. Let's face it, folks, the progenitors of this film were B movies long before they became ""classics"" of the horror genre. As such, they endured decades of critical scorn before being appreciated. Will this achieve the same fate? Probably not, but it's not the turkey everyone is saying!Disclaimer: I'm a boomer. I grew up with high-concept silly movies and learned how to adopt a mindset to appreciate them. Shoot, I was even able to find fun with ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (LXG) which was, by any measure, a much worse movie than this.The tactic here is relentless action which sweeps you along without giving you too much time to think of what's illogical (other than the mere existence of vampires, werewolves, et al). Is some of the action silly? Sure. But is it entertaining? It can be if you let it. Aside from the obvious derivations, there are, as others have noted, quotes and homages from a variety of other films. Those are fun. There is comic relief, mostly from David Wenham but also from Hugh Jackman himself. Is the heroine totally implausible? Duh, of course! But that's part of her job. Classic horror films have two types of women - crones and bimbos. Since there's no one comparable to Maria Ouspenskaya these days, we have to just settle for the babe.I rated this 8 out of 10. It's good mindless entertainment that pays due respect to its origins. Where it falls down is both at the very beginning and near the end. In the beginning, there's a sequence with Van Helsing and Mr Hyde/Dr. Jekyll where Mr. Hyde is every bit as overdone as in LXG. At the end, the temptation once again becomes too great and the climactic battle is between CGI creatures. Well done, but a bit disappointing. The very end of the movie is its Achilles heel - it's a real downer and probably hurts the word of mouth for the show.Should you see it? If you liked ""The Mummy"", you may well like this. Just don't be too swayed by the critics. Many of them were wrong about the original Universal horror films, as they have been later over other FX-laden films. Especially if you're of boomer age like me, you may find yourself having a pretty good time with it.",Van Helsing
257,ChrisTreborn,Another Hollywood Crap,1,17 July 2004,"You want to get Worst of the Worst from a Movie. Watch Stephen Somers directed Val Helsing. Worst plot, worst story telling, worst side kick, worst villain, worst female lead, worst chemistry, worst costumes, worst CGI, Worst Dracula and above all the worst Spin-off ever happened in the movie history.Van Helsing (Spoilers******)Set in 19th Century London, Rome, Paris and Transylvaniawhere mankind is in constant danger from evil in different forms only one man fights for the human race. He is the Vampire hunter Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman).After an encounter with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde he went for a mission in Transylvania with his side kick Carl (David Wenham) who makes him James Bond style weapons, of course made with that period technology. In Transylvania he has to protect the last member of the Valerious family Anna, played by beautiful Kate Beckinsale. But for that he must stand against Dracula.Oh and also..He must fight against The Werewolf, The Frankenstein monster, Dracula's bloodthirsty Bridesand finally get the girl from the villain. That's it, that's the story - The Ultimate Spin-off of the century.The only simplest thing that went wrong in this movie was the director, who failed to give any importance for the Story. Also the CGI which played an important part in this movie, looked OVERDONE. The iconic characters showcased as Cartoon like figures as we already seen in Mummy Returns (Rock as the Scorpion King), Matrix Reloaded (Neo fights with multiple Agents).Background score is so weak that we will not remember the theme after an hour.And the most disgraced thing in this movie was The Dracula, such a legendary role was ruined by actor Richard Roxburgh. His version of lethally Un-seductive, Russian slang Count Dracula was the worst Dracula ever seen in the Hollywood history. Even my young brother couldn't understand that he was playing Dracula.Only strength in the movie is Logan ! Yes, Hugh Jackman in this movie is just standing out there, without any Good inputs. We see him as Van Helsing only because he had the tough guy image of Wolverine. Failing miserably, for presenting any attitudes to Van Helsing.When I look back the whole movie, it was like an uncontrolled Roller Coaster. All actions, all the mess, all underplayed humors, all the screams.O.K notable features of this movie.1) Transformation of Wolfman that was really eye popping movement.2) Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's Monster He gave a realistic emotional part to this legendary character.3) By knowing that it is a bad script Stephen Somers's guts to direct the movie.Hey this movie is not that much bad as The Hulk. See this if you want to waste some good time of your life.I give this movie 1 out of 10.Van Helsing = Walk Out",Van Helsing
258,El Guapo-2,Brilliant re-imagining of the 30's Universal Monster Classics,8,27 October 2004,"If this is what Stephen Summers can do for the old 30's and 40's Universal Monster Classic series of films, then the good Lord only knows what is in store for us with ""Flash Gordon""!This is one of the best summer movies since the first ""Mummy"", also from Summers. Just like in that film, he's taken the standard mythology of an established series and introduced it to high-tech modern day film production. The integration between live-action photography and computer generated graphics is as seamless as I've ever seen, and puts ""The Hulk"" to shame. Remember that they are moving the camera and establishing a path for a character that will be digitally inserted later and then you begin to appreciate the expert technical efficiency in which the film was produced. The actors chosen are all professionals and know how to do their job, Roxburgh is given special notice for his ballsy performance as a Dracula that expertly modulates between euro-trash sexy and full-blown campy. Beckinsale does her usual impersonation of a wooden plank, the role did not require much effort in my opinion. Her accent is amusing for all the wrong reasons, same as in ""From Hell"" with Heather Graham. And just as Graham has no idea how bad her accent is in ""From Hell"", Beckinsale is also clueless, but it adds to the charm and enjoyment of the film. Silvestri's score is among the best he has ever done and Summers should not take the mediocre and lukewarm reception that ""Van Helsing"" got from audiences to heart. The film made some money in its secondary life anyway, which is where 80% of all the returns come from these days.Summers is nearly at the point of mastering his craft and I am looking forward to ""Flash Gordon"".",Van Helsing
259,moviefan2003va,Okay summer movie,7,3 June 2004,"Contrary to popular opinion, I think Sommers really did want to pay homage to pass horror movies more than make a movie to make money. However, this film is genre specific. If you don't like these kinds of movies and don't come to just have fun then you won't. This won't attract the Mean Girls crowd.  The problem is character development.  The characters like Van Helsing and Anna Valerious do not have time to just gestate and absorb their surrounds before being thrust into another situation. Therefore any display of emotion by these two main characters seems choppy and erratic. I think there is chemistry between Jackman and Beckinsale but it was not necessary to include that kissing scene. There was not enough character development to reach that point before the end of the movie. The one tender moment the two leads are allowed to have is when they are in the rain.However, summmer movie standards are lower standards and the movie and character development in my opinion is no better than that of The Day After Tomorrow and Troy which suffer from the same problems. If you like this genre and want to have fun then go see it.The basic story of trying to find a way for Dracula to bring his children to life is fine. The dracula character was decently well thought out and so was Frankenstein who was fabulously played by Hensley.  The friar was great! Igor was fine as well. I also enjoyed the brides.  I didn't have a problem with the accents like others. I appreciated that the actors were consistent in using their accents.",Van Helsing
260,Steven Reynolds,The end of imagination,2,8 May 2004,"Designed in a boardroom, created on a computer, ""Van Helsing"" is the unholy progeny of a serial plagiarist and insatiable corporate greed.  The result is the cinematic equivalent of a computer-generated woman: lovely to look at, but brain-dead and ultimately inhuman.  Laughably unbearable when it isn't merely puerile, ""Van Helsing"" sees Sommers take his aping of Spielberg to new lows, while expanding his derivative grasp to squander James Whale, more of Universal's back catalogue of monsters  Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and the Wolf Man  and the worst elements of John Williams and George Lucas.  The film's monochrome opening in Transylvania pays tribute to Whales' ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935) with a frenzied, torch-lit mob armed with pitchforks and scythes surging toward Dr. Frankenstein's castle against a huge night sky.  Sommers might claim he was aiming for homage but it ends up playing like a mockery  or, at best, a nod to Mel Brooks.  ""Van Helsing"" is postmodern in the worst sense: a collage of cinematic references distorted through a high-tech lens, assembled for no other purpose than liberating money from the wallets of gullible teens.  About twenty minutes in you ""get it""; you realise why this film is so awful.  It doesn't need to tell a story, because it isn't a film: it's an ear-flaying, mind-raping 132-minute commercial for ancillary markets  the toys, the TV show and the video game  all of which, as Universal happily admits, are ready and waiting for the greenlight if the ""film"" cracks the undisclosed boxoffice nut.  The saddest thing is that ""Van Helsing"" doesn't need to be this bad. Boxoffice infernos can be stoked with quality product, e.g. ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  It just requires talent.  For Sommers, handing over the writing to someone with an imagination probably would have been enough.  For unlike that other doyen of event films, Jerry Bruckheimer, who has an unparalleled gift for assembling Z-grade talent, Sommers was blessed with a stellar cast and an immensely talented crew.  Yet he does nothing but ritually humiliate them.  And his sources.  And us.  It's sadly ironic that most of Sommers' literary sources sprang from minds  indeed, a whole era  which worried about the intersection of culture and unbridled technology.  A century later, what has it delivered?  The hairy butt-crack of a digital Mr. Hyde.",Van Helsing

Hugh Jackman is a great actor, see him in top acting condition in The Prestige and Happy Feet.I suppose I should tell the storyline, which I barely remember. It deals with Dracula and his three wives who make lots of little baby-vamps to take over the world. It has something to do with Frankenstein, too. Uh, yeah.

I like a movie that gets me thinking about the big questions.  Such as: What separates this movie from the Mummy Movie?  Or the Muppet movie for that matter?  FX done Vs. CGI Overdone?  Is Chemistry (of the Leads in love) important?  Is it all in the hat?  Do Sand people (as Servants to the dark god) exist where ever they are dropped in as shorthand?  Is there a `New' Prevalence for endings that don't end?  
I found it very telling that they ran an ad for a Mummy movie roller-coaster-carnival ride Herr Director is Building @ Universal studios directly before the movie.  Marketing, product tie-in, merchandising and the endless trappings of big business (can somebody out there in the freeway of what we call awareness give me an example of something that has gotten better because it got bigger?  Big Government?  Big Religion?  Big Building? Big Hospital?  Big Ego?  Maybe I just need a nap.) add a painful dimension to it all.Things I liked: Flock of Seagulls Friar.  (Sure I'm Catholic  but I'm not a `Good Catholic.') Frankenstein with the zapping blue flowing through his brain.  (I dream of Jeanie with the light bluehair.) Vlad being a tad coy.  (3 Brides, Thousands of Eggs.  One can only visualize Dick and Andy dragging out the old dead horse of: `It's all for the kids.')

Well, go waste your money yourself and then tell me what you think. I watched most of this movie with my head shaking in my hands. It was SO bad. I'm just gonna randomly rant: Each actor's accent is worse than the last. The brides are comical and annoying. Frankenstein, played by another Australian stage actor, sounds like a stage actor, practically singing all his lines and overacting. I thought I was watching a musical a couple times. The worst Dracula ever put on screen. The effects range from good to horrid. The music... okay, the music I liked. What were Kate and Hugh thinking? I like both of you! RUN from this crap! Do NOT do a sequel! Blatant plot exposition everywhere. Horrible dialogue. Why does every character (including Frankenstein) have ninja-like reflexes and agility?

Fact is this relied on the special effects but the story so awful and the the runtime was far too long ...

266,The Spectacular Spider-Man,Lower your lowest expectations to their lowest - and then lower them,1,22 July 2004,"I tried very, very hard to watch it a few days ago - because of Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. I lowered my expectations to expect a very poor movie, but with the odd entertaining part. My bad. I could only watch for about 30 minutes. I love brainless action as much as the next man - if it's good brainless action. I love CGI - if it's good CGI. I'd be happy to let Jackman and Beckinsale coast on their charisma - if they had the chance to show any. I'd happily watch a bunch of monsters fighting - if it was done with any degree of competence.
There's a secret rule of action movies that Sommers doesn't understand. If you're going to have no proper characterisation, atleast make the audience like the hero somehow (humour is a good way) so we'll want to see what happens to them. Bottom line: Steven Sommers obsession with empty spectacle, full of poor CGI and limp action, is infinetly worse than that of George Lucas. Sommers is even worse than Roland Emmerich, he's the worst filmaker in Hollywood and I will NEVER, EVER watch another of his films, even for a minute. I doubt I could if I tried.",Van Helsing

I think it is the best movie I have seen in a long time and plan to watch it a second time.  I'm not sure why more critics haven't given this movie a higher rating.

Hugh Jackman looked good in this role and Kate Beckinsale also looked good especially after the whole Underworld experience. But as I was looking at the credits I felt disappointed that this movie was actually written and directed by Stephen Sommers of `The Mummy' fame. Which goes without saying that I did not enjoy the last Mummy film.As expected the film was filled with action and CGI characters. The meshing of the characters was uncoordinated. The little comic relief from David Wenham was drab and unoriginal. The acting, dialogue and plot were absolutely substandard. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was probably Art Direction, and Costumes.If you are in for a mindless thrill ride then perhaps you might enjoy this movie.

269,paulnewman2001,Monster mess,4,13 October 2004,"The teaser footage for this Universal monster mash looked so promising you can only wonder how director Stephen Sommers dropped the brain so badly after his earlier successful transplant of new life into The Mummy.Reuniting the staple horror film icons of Dracula, the Frankenstein monster and a wolfman a la House Of Dracula/House Of Frankenstein looked to be a sure-fire formula for 90 minutes of nostalgic, goofy fun but somewhere along the line it went the way of Baron Victor's lumbering creation and rose from its gurney a half-finished, bloated patchwork of iconic moments from other, better, movies.The opening is a bravura homage/resurrection of the 1931 Frankenstein's climactic windmill immolation, shot in gloriously textured monochrome, but it's a potential which soon falters as clandestine Vatican monster-hunter Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) catches up to an outsized Edward Hyde on top of Notre Dame in a direct steal from Alan Moore's The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen.Thereafter, he's swiftly teamed up with a Q-like monk (David Wenham), gypsy princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale, emoting like a bodice-clad wardrobe and spouting the most hilarious eastern European accent since Star Trek's Chekov) and an arsenal of improbable weaponry (automatic crossbow, anyone?) and is sent to Transylvania to foil a scheme by Count Dracula (a staggeringly hammy Richard Roxburgh) and his three brides to steal the Frankenstein monster's energy to hatch out their offspring. Oh, and a wolfman pops up a lot.Given the beautiful Gothic fairytale look of the film, it's overburdened at every turn by some unforgivably ropey computer animation until it looks as if Sommers is just hurling expensive spectacle at the screen for its own sake (a coach and horses leaping a yawning 50ft chasm, for crying out loud).Jackman's a fine heroic lead but, like all these characters, is sketched in as a two-dimensional thumbnail with nothing to do but trudge grimly on until wooden stakes and the end credits save us all.",Van Helsing

Add to that the fact that Stephen Sommers is not a very good director and an even worse writer and what you have is a story that would struggle to make it as a comic book much less as a feature-length movie.All throughout this misadventure into stupidity, Sommers tries to imbue his characters with personality and the story with some meaning. He fails on both counts. He wants to entertain us (I'm assuming) but instead winds up wasting about two hours of our time.Hugh Jackman does his best, but every line he is given is such a clunker that no matter how much you want to like him or his character, you just can't. Kate Beckinsale once again proves why she should never be allowed in front of a camera - every time she lays that horrible accent on us, you just want Dracula to rip her throat open so we can be done with her.Except that if he did, she'd turn into one of those hideous CGI critters that someone, somewhere mistakenly thought would be a good idea.This movie is a convoluted, idiotic mess designed to sell toys and rip our movie-going dollars from our pockets.

Dracula is over-the-top in his ridiculous Bela Legosi impersonation. The Frankenstein is too melodramatic, and Igor is just a wise cracking smarta**. Then there's the silly plot of Dracula needing a wolfman to somehow harness a life giving power that isn't really needed, cause he's gonna get it from Frankenstein instead.

While many adults can see the flaws of this movie, I think that many teens are going to really enjoy this one.  The action is non-stop and the computer generated images are pretty solid.  Ok, I agree with some of the comments that the acting is poor, it isnt great, but it is entertaining.   I was able to take my 21 year old girlfriend to this and she didnt complain one time during the movie.  This from a person who likes sappy movies from Legally Blonde to the Rugrats.  Although, not quite as good to me as Underworld, Van Helsing was able to deliver on the action goods as advertised in trailers on TV.  Jackman is decent as VanHelsing and Beckinsale is at least nice to look at.  The girl that play Mishkala ( I think her name is Josie something) was most impressive to me in her limited role- she reeked of evil and seduction.     So why not take your teens to see something that will at least entertain them for 2 hours.  There are a lot worse things they could see or be doing. For my 28 yr old perspective, some of the scenes are a bit unrealistic (see the stage coach scene and some of the parts near the end with beckinsale) but all in all I have to give this one a 7.",Van Helsing
274,JamesMitchell451,ehhhhh....,4,21 September 2013,"The greatest monster hunter of them all has his work cut out for him as he tracks down three deadly foes in this action-adventure saga. Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man who has dedicated his life to battling evil forces who exist outside the bounds of nature; Van Helsing's work has not always made him friends, and a false accusation of murder still trails him. But when he's summoned to Transylvania at the behest of Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), whose family has been fighting supernatural beings for generations, Van Helsing wastes no time answering her call. There, Van Helsing discovers that the undying vampire Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) has put a misshapen creature named Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) under his spell, and, in turn, has forged an alliance with a hideous monster (Shuler Hensley) who was created by the misguided Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Samuel West). Adding to Anna's burden is her brother, Velkan (Will Kemp), a lycanthrope who becomes a bloodthirsty wolf under the light of the full moon. Van Helsing also co- stars Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca, and Josie Maran as Dracula's vampire brides. ~ (Mark Deming, Rovi) While the film has some impressive action scenes, some good cgi, and good pacing, what ultimately brings the film down is the nonexistent plot, terrible dialogue, terrible acting, and no real sense of fun and a lack of real thrills. And the worst part of all: They are going to do a reboot of this: Cause it worked so well the first time.",Van Helsing
275,KillerCadugen,Soulless,5,10 May 2004,"SPOILERS AHEAD - Although I left the theater feeling entertained, it was a hollow feeling. It got even hollower as I explained to my family (which, by and large, liked the movie) about the original myths of the vampires, werewolves, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and even Frankenstein. I don't understand how Stephen Sommers can sit there and say he is paying homage to the old classic Universal monsters when all he did was twist the myths to suit his movie. A Mr. Hyde that was far more monstrous that the original story intended? A vampire that can morph into some demonic being and be killed only by a werewolf? A vampire hunter that was nearly immortal? Vampires than can breed (come on!)? Although on the surface the movie is very entertaining, Van Helsing is a soulless, CGI-driven cartoon that should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the classic Universal monsters. Maybe Sommers could have sacrificed some of the CGI in order to develop the characters a little more - to maybe reveal a little of what Van Helsing's secret is, to learn a little more about the family being torn apart by Dracula. About the only thing Sommers seemed to do right is the Frankenstein monster, which was a lot closer to what Mary Shelley had depicted (except for the electrical circuits and whatnot in his head, which was a cool touch). You can have Van Helsing, give me Dracula with Bela Lugosi, Frankenstein with Boris Karloff, and The Wolf Man with Lon Chaney Jr anytime.",Van Helsing
276,jjgooner,Unoriginal and Poorly Acted,4,1 July 2013,"Van Helsing*1/2 (out of 4)131 mins/ 12Cast: Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, Richard RoxburghDirector: Steven SommersPlot: Monster slayer, Van Helsing, is sent on a mission to kill the immortal Count Dracula.JJ's Verdict: With nothing original about it, it is unsurprising that 'Van Helsing' is dull and very uninteresting. Featuring Count Dracula, Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, Igor, The Wolfman and of course Van Helsing, all of the film's characters have already been seen a hundred times before. This also means that the plot has been seen a hundred times before. And even its most original character is a clichéd damsel in distress who is somehow good at fighting as well.In this film, Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing is sent to Transylvania to kill Count Dracula. Jackman, although usually very good, is at best, average here. His accent is a mix of Australian, English, American and Eastern European (considering his character is Dutch) and he doesn't show much emotion which leads the viewer really not caring what happens to him.. The action is well held up by a suspenseful score by Alan Silvestri but somehow still manages to be predictable and boring. Only in the end, when there is something to fight for, does the action start to feel fun and inspired. The transition from scene to scene is poor and that is down to some awful sound editing. The film's lighting is also dreadful, so much so that in some of the night scenes you can't actually see half the action. Stephen Sommers dialogue is pretty laughable and makes Kate Beckinsale's acting seem much worse than it is. Richard Roxburgh plays the Count very well but it's just a shame that he is surrounded by a CGI and effects overload. I was also very surprised that 'Van Helsing' was given a 12 certificate by the BBFC. There are some moments of genuine horror and some scenes are extremely (to put it mildly), gooey. The ending is also very soppy but surprisingly unhollywood. Not for anyone under ten, 'Van Helsing' is another remake/retelling/reboot that has failed.",Van Helsing
277,Dia Klain,This scared me.,1,7 May 2004,"You know how big budget American movies have this reputation of being bad (due to badly contrived plots, bad unrealistic affects, generic hero/heroin, obvious ending, eye candy that isn't all that sweet) yah that's the kind. Well this movie, let me tell you, is the KING of all the movies with that stereotype. Let me explain something first of all, this is NOT a review of Van Hellsing, maybe, one day, when I have nothing better to do I'll write one, today is not the day, however. Today is the day when I will simply say this is quite possibly the worst big budget action movie of its genre. The guy who did this was famous for the Mummy. Personally I feel the Mummy was good (ok, so the second was bad but still) THIS, however well let's put it this way, the first 5 min are good. The second color filters into the movie it goes downhill. And just when it hits the bottom and you know it can't get worse, it starts borrowing into the ground to get even lower. I would like to also stress that this movie has more plot holes that I noticed (upon one viewing only I might add) then all other movies I have ever seen (and I'v seen a lot) that, right there, should say something.",Van Helsing

This film should be taken strictly for it's entertainment value. Within the genre of ""Horror"" this film will probably never be considered a classic, however, for the sheer thrill and the ""edge of the seat"" nail-biting action, the viewer will be more than satisfied. Not to mention, Kate Beckinsale (Anna) is very pleasant to watch. This movie is of the same ilk as ""Underworld"", again costarring the lovely Kate. Hugh Jackman (Van Helsing) is believable in his role and the supporting cast turns in some very favorable performances. I would have liked to have seen ""Frankie-boy"" in a more ""traditional"" getup though.

The very concept of Dracula , Frankenstein's monster , The wolfman and van helsing all together in one big smack down sounded like my kind of film .""There is no way this is gonna fail ! "" I cried. Unfortunately i was wrong.Van helsing is a mess. What should have been a blockbuster to remember ends up being a monotonous non interactive video game of a film. The character of van helsing is a mere shadow of the complete and utter badass he could have been  and Dracula is more camp and annoying  than scary.So the central hero and villain are both unappealing-but do the problems stop there ? NO ! Kate beckinsales character doesn't  really allow you to care for her , especially with her annoying fake accent and Frankenstein's monster..... what the hell did they do to Frankenstein's monster?The pace is relentless  and the action is non stop ,but since there is not much good story telling in addition to all the bangs and crashes on display , you wont really be that excited  when  van helsing starts blasting away monsters.The special effects are impressive and allan silvestris score works well but these are the only good factors  in an other wise poor film.It could have been so much better.",Van Helsing

And this is the film's biggest mistake.  If Sommers had cut an action scene or two and replaced them with smaller more intimate moments, this could have been something special.  As it is, it's just enjoyable trash with nice expensive CGI and great production values.I liked the ending but as I said, since the characters aren't rounded, we don't feel the strong emotions we should.

284,Volstag,Van Pointless,5,24 May 2004,"Van Helsing is all smoke and mirrors.  It uses tremendous amounts of ""shock & awe"" to hide the fact that it doesn't have a compelling story or interesting characters.  The whole experience was similar to watching someone play a video game for roughly 2 hours.  I also felt that this particular movie was suffering from an identity crisis: it could never decide what kind of movie it wanted to be.  Is it a comedy?  Is it horror? Is it drama?  It was, quite simply, trying to do too much with too little story to back it up.This movie was _almost_ bad enough to make it into a good movie (e.g. Troll II, Deathstalker III, etc), but, unfortunately, it also failed in that regard.* spoiler *What's the deal with Anna's (Beckinsale) family appearing in the clouds at the end of the movie?

285,Roddy-15,Shallow adventure movie,5,6 May 2004,"Van Helsing seems to have been written by the same screenwriter who wrote The League of Extraordinary Men. That movie had a lot of characters we are all familiar with (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the Invisible Man, etc) as the good guys. Van Helsing, on the other hand, has werewolves and vampires as the bad guys. This film may be better than League of Extraordinary Men. But its flaws don't allow it to be a good movie either.Caution: the following may contain spoilers.The first problem comes from the fact that most of the battles between Van Helsing and the evil vampires are simply repetitive. The female vampires battle against Van Helsing and his friends, and they are defeated. After a few minutes, the vampires come back for more. They are defeated. People start to get bored because they are overwhelmed with a sense of deja-vu. Dracula brings his offspring back to life. Then they die. Later in the movie, he brings more offspring back to life again. We are just getting more of the same stuff. Another problem is cheesy dialogue. Most of it comes from the female vampires. All these problems are  nothing compared to the disappointing ending you are going to see.  The visual effects are great in this movie. It seems that every time a movie is short on plot, Hollywood glosses over this shortcoming by saturating it with the most beautiful special effects money can buy. But not even that can stop you from getting bored before the movie reaches its climax.",Van Helsing
286,philipdavies,Consumption of cheaply-conceived yet expensively-made junk fails to satisfy.,1,7 November 2007,"Hollywood films of pure 'popcorn' entertainment value don't require any excuse beyond that of the old fairground barker of cheap sensation who is their true ancestor. And the casual audience for this sort of tripe are not about to be persuaded into an appreciation of any art-house offerings. If there are both producers and audiences out there who want to throw vast sums of their money into the production of rubbish, so be it. About half-an-hour of this frantic and wildly misfiring film was quite enough to take me well past the boredom barrier. 'Van Helsing' actually thinks it is quite a cool and witty film, with all those horror-movie references, when in actual fact it is nothing but a farrago of enormously expensive and utterly tedious special effects.If you want modern witty and cool with great CGI, go to Pitof's superbly atmospheric and gripping take on the criminal underworld of old Paris, in 'Vidocq'.If you want witty and cool with that old-fashioned grasp of the magic that already haunts the movie camera, go to Polanski's hilarious and chilling nightmare 'Dance of the Vampires'.But of course if you are perfectly satisfied by the consumption of this cheaply-conceived yet expensively-made junk, then that is your business.

287,jon2005,Van Helsing,5,22 May 2006,"With The Mummy (1999), Stephen Sommers showed us that he could make a film that had character, plenty of CGI, and was just plain fun. The sequel was not so good  less plot, worse CGI, and not so much fun. So a step down, then. The pitch for Van Helsing must have seemed brilliant to studio bosses: take the three biggest horror characters of the 1800's (namely Dracula, the Wolf Man, and Frankenstein's Monster) and shove them together with a hero who, whilst originally was just a mild-mannered doctor, is now a kick-ass monster hunter. What could possibly go wrong? I'll tell you. The problem is that Van Helsing seems like a continuation of the Mummy series just with a different story: virtually no character, massive amounts of (not that great) CGI, and little fun. It's yet another step down for the director who, although has proved he's up for plenty of action, cannot put any life into it. Hugh Jackman appears to be the perfect lead for the role of Gabriel Van Helsing, but he never gets the chance to give depth to his character  as soon as he kills one set of baddies, he's off to kill some more. He can handle the action well (but we already knew this from the X-Men films), and could probably handle any real drama that should have been inserted into the film, but the director just doesn't seem to want us to know anything about any of the characters, he just wants to see them fight, which is not enough. I couldn't help but think that if things had been taken a little slower, the film could have been made that much more interesting  less would have been more in this case. It's as if Sommers is afraid to take a breath lest the audience realise how hollow the film really is.The film was also pitched as a horror/action film, and yet there is not one moment that provides a genuine chill or cheap scare, although it is very dark (it's mostly set at night  I didn't mean atmospherically!) Admittedly some of the action scenes and sets are convincing, and the film does have good production values, but once again it seems the budget has gone towards all the CGI, and not on the script or story. With each film, Sommers seems to include more and more monsters, as if he is trying to outdo his last film in terms of effects. This is a prime example of the ""quality not quantity"" adage, as the more CGI there is, the less real it looks. The action scenes quickly become repetitive and although start off original and good, end up being a bit of a bore. And really, how many times to we have to see the lead characters swing on a rope in front of a castle? It's just not necessary.Overall, it's a real shame that the film turned out this way. It really needed to be either a slower horror film, or an action film which did not feel the need to rush through at such a pace that the audience are afraid to blink lest they miss something. Stephen Sommers must learn how to do character first, action second, if he's going to keep a fan base going; relying on visual effects alone just isn't enough for us anymore.Rated: 5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",Van Helsing
288,dragonslayer-87950,Underrated IMO.......,9,14 October 2021,"To start off In My Opinion this Film Really shouldn't be taken all too Seriously, it's just meant to be just a Fun Halloween Themed Action Flick. Kind of like how I,Frankenstein is suppose to be.And with that in mind I Personally Love the Film it is a Must for me Every Year on Halloween Night. But more on that latter, but to start off I loved how it starts off like how you would Expect a Traditional Horror Film would be, Black and White Nor. And to me Personally there is a bit of a Symbolism to that, and I'm just not talking about the opening scene. But the entire movie, again more on that later. Anyways First I just Love that Gas Powered Crossbow that Van Helsing has. And I Also enjoyed the interactions of both the Character Van Helsing and the Character Carl, in fact I Enjoy the Character Carl, it's obvious he's supposed to be the Comedic Relief Character, and for me he was a Great at it, I also thought that the actor did an excellent job at it too and not only that he seemed to fit the look as well. Then Next is I Loved the Look and Design of All Three Vampire Brid but also of Dracula as well, I though t that actor was Perfectly Casted. Then there are themes in the Film from the Marching Theme to the End Ascending Up To Heaven, I know those most likely aren't they officially names for themes but that what I called them, they are also a couple of my Favorite Themes in the Film. I also have many Favorite Scenes in the film one of them is at the end with that Somber Theme, I Hope that's Not Too Much Of A Spoiler. So, I Guess it's time to Finally Tell you, the reason about the Symbolism thing that I Teased you about Earlier on. Is because of the Tune of the Film, it acts like a Metaphor for not just for Halloween itself but also for the whole month of October. To simplify it, in the Beginning when it is Black and White the month of October of Black and White a Mystery, and as the film gets going it like the month October. And when as the Film goes on so does the Month of October, and by the time we get to the Chase Scene with the March Theme, it's like the March Theme itself is telling us to Hurry up to do whatever we need to do because by this time it is only a week before the Arrival of the Halloween Night. Which means we need to get your Candy to make a final Decision on a Halloween Costume and to Decorate Your House if we haven't already and so on, on a Normal October Year, because Halloween Night is Approaching Really Fast so much so Halloween Night would be hare before you know it. And then Fast-forward to the End by then in the Real World...well that's it Halloween is Over for another Year because it is Officially November 1st 12:01 AM, take from that what you well, pending on how you Feel about Halloween, and that is why I Not only like to watch this film on Halloween Night but also I like to Time it so that it would end some time after Midnight and in the Early Morning on November 1st of that year. I also think that the final Battle all three characters where Perfectly Matched. I also Like the Artwork on the Cover, It's Unfortunate that they took out one of my favorite Features for the BD Version at least the Version of the Film that I have, and that is The Dracula's Castel Tour. And the couple of final things that I like about is that. The First is that The world feels Populated at no point in the film where I thought that whenever there is scene that is supposed to be Populated with people that I felt that it felt Hallow or Empty, unless it is a scene with just one or two with our main characters even then the world doesn't empty or hollow just because there is supposed to be just one or two other character there aside from our main characters in a situation like that in the real world. And the Second thing is for all of the Tense and Proposes the Character Carl should have been a Useless character in Theory but he was not.Now as much as I enjoy this film even, I have to admit there are some down sides to it. The first is that Frankenstein doesn't look like the Traditional Frankenstein he doesn't even feel very much like Frankenstein just because How Well and How Much he Talks ever Since Anna and Van Helsing found him and his Hiding Spot by Accident. About that Scene I do Love the Debate between the Two on how to Deal with Frankenstein at that point. The Second is that One line that One Vampire Bride Aleera Delivered During the Climax fight, and that one line was ""I Say You Can Go When I Say You Can Go, And I Say When You Can Go When You Are Dead."" I don't know there's something about that line that sounds.... I don't know how to explain it Dumb sounds a little to far, just off I guess in terms of that Character and to the rest of the Film as a whole. It makes the Character Aleera sound dumb and off Character in a way. Any ways the next is that Speaking of, I know they had to give Frankenstein something to do aside from having him being the Goal for the Villains of the Film. I wish they gave him something else to do other than Assist with two of the three fights in the Climax, especially if he's the one who finish's off two of the three Villains by Accident of all things. I wished they would have gave him something else to do some thing else anything else aside from interfering with the two of the three battles. With Carl I would have had him Accidently Trip and make Igor Fly off the Cliff or something, and as for Anna I would have just have her fight and eventually have her finish off Aleera by finding something Pointy and Stabbing her in the Heart or whatever. Instead of what we eventually got in the in the actual film, I get it they have the Time to Worry about and coupled with the Fact that we need to get to the Big Fight the Main Fight With Dracula and Van Helsing. What they could have done is just make the other two fights shorter or just trim some scenes down. Not That I feel there are wasted Scenes in the film, but I would rather see Both Anna and Carl fight their Respective Opponents in the climax instead. And I guess this is considered a Nip Pick but that shoot of the Cow After the Vampire Bride Attack in that one Scene kind of felt Comedic to me and Not In a Good Way. Sure, it's not to the Caliber of the one line but close. Well actually I don't know which was worse that Line or that Cow? And the final thing I could see how some people especially for today think that the Special Effects are Bad and Definitely Does Not Hold Up for today, yeah, I kind of see that too, but I have decided to ignore that fact, for the simple Reason I try not to take it too seriously like I have said before, it's not like it's trying to be a Future Classic or anything like that it's just trying to be what it is a Fun Halloween Themed Action Film to watch in the Month of October as I have said.Final thoughts, I'm just going to give it to you straight. Since I enjoy it that much for the above Positive Reasons to me in the Second Paragraph, to me it just wouldn't feel like Real Halloween or even a Real October if I Skipped watching Van Helsing for one reason or another for one year it would just feel like some kind of Weird Imitation.",Van Helsing
289,scotty-37,"A forgettable movie, but teens may like it",4,7 May 2004,"This movie has non-stop action, but I was bored.  I just can't work myself up to care much about these characters since they weren't developed effectively.Yes, we're told that the Anna's family has been killed by Dracula and there has been an ongoing feud. We're even shown some events leading up to the main story, but I just didn't care a whole lot.  Dropping a little lead-in to the story doesn't always work as character development. Most of the movie is big, banal, and boring.To be fair, some of the fight sequences were interesting and about 4 or 5 different lines in the movie got laughs from the audience, but overall this isn't a movie worth paying $7-$12 to see.  Teens may enjoy it on an outing with their friends, and they may feel like they're seeing something dark or edgy.  I suspect it won't interest most over- 25-year-olds much, since they'll see a lot of posturing.The pacing wasn't effective.  Stephen Sommers is apparently afraid to let his characters interact in any significant way except fighting.  He doesn't allow much down time between fights for character development, plot development, or even for contrast.  It all seems like one long fight scene for 2 hours and 10 minutes.Hand in hand with the pacing, the music is terribly wrong.  It does the wrong things at the wrong times.  It stays on a hyperactive note for the entire movie--which contributes to the pacing and contrast problems.  I got very tired of the drums and orchestra hits at completely inappropriate times. The music tries to make everything seem huge, exciting, or terrifying and succeeds in making everything seem exactly the same for the entire movie. It only wants to play one mood for the entire length.  Sometimes less is more, and some restraint and variety are required--something that neither the director nor the composer did right.There were a few things that made me laugh in this movie although they were not intended to make me laugh.The squishy/slurpy/slimy sound-effects in part of the movie were so over-the-top that they just called attention to themselves and made me chuckle.Then there was the CHiPs moment at the end of a vehicle chase scene. Hmm, what's the most spectacular ending for a chase scene in CHiPs and most other 70s cop shows?  Expect the same here.  I know there was an explanation. It was still funny, explanation or not.The special effects mostly looked like they cost the studio a lot--which is probably why they seem desperate for this movie to succeed.  You'll get some eye candy, so if that's what you're looking for, you might enjoy the movie.In all, unless you're a teen, you only want to see this movie as a time waster, or for the special effects, I'd go get the video game instead.  It's sure to be more involving.",Van Helsing
290,DevastationBob-3,Dracula sucks...and so does this movie.,1,26 June 2005,"It's taken a year to come to terms with my feelings on Van Helsing...I didn't want to be another face in the sea of people who came out hating this movie. And hate it I did, but it's gone beyond just mere distaste. I've carried the seed of loathing for it in my heart, and that seed has borne a bitter fruit. No longer can I burden myself under the diseased weight of Van Helsing, I must vent my bile and share.Mercifully, parts of it have faded, or failed to encode themselves in the first place upon my memory. I have no recollection of a soundtrack for example, which doesn't say much for it. I think I'll attack things in a more or less chronological order, and trust you'll forgive me any errors in my recounting, chalking them up to my mind's natural attempts to protect me from any longterm effects of viewing ""the movie"".So we start off with a black and white introduction, no doubt an homage to the Universal Horror Movies Van Helsing draws much inspiration from. How much easier to use B&W to do this, than say...i dunno actual setting and atmosphere, or talented direction and performances. From the moment of his appearance, Richard Roxburgh is a gangrenous arrow lodged in my heart. His interpretation of Dracula as effete twit does more damage to the count than all of Vlad Tepes's crimes combined. From the way he's filmed, you assume the director thinks he's some kind of great performer, someone that deserves to have the camera on him constantly. This is simply not the case. A retarded orangutan with a sledgehammer in a Faberge egg shop has more subtlety and dignity than Roxburgh will ever be capable of. He doesn't even have an interesting face, a feature many other actors can use as a tool to heighten their performance. All Roxburgh has is Thompson Twin hair and incriminating pictures of Steven Sommers apparently.We then cut to Paris where our hero Van Helsing is trying to kill Shrek. Or Mr. Hyde, it doesn't really matter. He certainly owes a lot to Indiana Jones and Vampire Hunter D (a Japanese cartoon featuring vampires, werewolves, and wide brimmed hat wearing, long haired mystery man which is incidentally also a much better movie for people who want this kind of monster mash entertainment done well) a source i'm sure the costume designers, etc. were well familiar with. I'll take an aside her to mention that I don't really fault Hugh Jackman with anything in this movie, and i'm sure the wheelbarrow of cash they dumped in his lap was hard to turn his nose up to. I only hope Hugh takes more care with roles in his future.VH is sent to Transylvania to aid the Valerius family who have been ineffectually fighting monsters for generations. This raises the question...how long can a family ineffectually fight monsters before they're just a large grouping of the same last name on a buncha headstones? We're witness to their incompetence when we see that their tactics for hunting werewolves involves only one guy being given a silver bullet, and arming the rest of the hunting party with regular firearms. Also, the Valerius family can't seem to remember which accent they're supposed to be using. None more guilty of this than cinematic albatross, Kate Beckinsale as Anna. She goes from Transylvanian, to British, to British trying to sound American, and at one point Natasha from Bullwinkle, which I found odd. She may be easy on the eyes, but with Van Helsing completing the trifecta of Pearl Harbor and Underworld, If I see her name on the cast list, it's nature's way of warning you that there's gonna be some bad movie ahead.So Drac's masterplan involves inflicting his bride's shorties on the world. But Movie, you say, don't vampires make other vampires by biting people? Isn't there a whole village of inbred idiots protected by ineffectual monster hunters ripe for the taking? No, we want cgi gremlin knockoffs. Oh, OK, I'll just lie back down and you can continue to kick my groin then, OK?Now, somehow, Frankenstein and the Wolfman tie into making the winged monkey's plan work, but for the life of me, I can't remember how, the hallmark of a really great script. There's so many plot holes pointing them all out may take up more space than IMDb is prepared to provide, so I'll just hit the highlights, some spoilers may follow, but nothing I say is gonna spoil this movie any more than the filmmaker's themselves have. During the carriage chase down winding roads, our fearless heroes fool the flying vampires by having a duplicate carriage on a side road....which should have been plainly visible to any airborne undead. If the wolf man is the only thing that can kill Dracula, why the hell does he keep them around? And it sure would seem that having the antidote handy would be a pretty effective means of negating the threat any potential wolf man assassins might present, but he keeps the tiny vial in a giant room of his goofy wire shrouded tower. Finally, Anna can have the crap kicked out of her by various monsters throughout the movie, even getting dropped five stories by a flying vampire onto a stone floor with a minimum of discomfort, but all it takes is VH to shove her onto a velvet couch while he's wolfed out to kill her.Van Helsing continues the tradition of incredibly stupid movies with a CGI comb-over that completely fails to distract from the glaring flaws inherent within, the tradition started with such movies as Dragonheart, the Lost World, Armageddon, etc. In addition, it's the second part of a career suicide note that Steven Sommer's started with the Mummy Returns, a vile movie that was without equal until Van Helsing came along. And there, is the only category where it excels.",Van Helsing
291,jwhale9382,"Before Blade, Before Buffy...",8,29 January 2005,"...There was Van Helsing! The Original Vampire Hunter! When I first saw the movie, I didn't really understand it. It seemed Stephen Sommers was trying to cram Dracula, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein all into the same movie. But after several viewings, the plot started to come together. I think its one of the best action movies ever.Hugh Jackman is no stranger to the action genre. In X-men, he got his hands dirty as Wolverine. In fact, in some ways, I think Wolverine and Van Helsing are a lot alike. Both are loners, both are fighters, and both are searching for answers. Carl is a genius. I don't know how Van Helsing got by without him.Richard Roxburgh was great as Dracula. He brought a suave, evil genius persona to the character. This made him both a lady's man and mastermind. All three of the Brides of Dracula were HOT! My favorite was Aleera. She was the best looking, but also the most psychotic. I liked Kevin J O'Connor as Igor. He served as the comic relief for the villains. (You may remember Kevin as Benny in THE MUMMY.) The visual effects in this movie were great, especially the parts where Dracula and his brides turn into vampire form. I thought the brides looked especially terrifying.To all the fans out there that like a lot of B.S.U (Blowing Stuff Up), this movie will not disappoint you. Hardly a minute goes by without something being blown up, or smashed, or shot. (Movie fans, are you interested?) I love this movie, and if you like lots of action, I know you will, too.",Van Helsing
292,mattbaxter72,Everything that's wrong with Hollywood,3,24 December 2006,"Yes, I know that's the kind of comment usually reserved for polo-necked film students when they're discussing anything that doesn't have subtitles. But I don't even own a polo-neck, and I think I can prove my point, that Van Helsing represents the reason that a lot of people don't bother with big-budget Hollywood movies any more. So, in no particular order:1. No plot. Now come on, writers are cheap, at least in Hollywood terms - even the legendary Joe Esterhasz only got about five million per movie back in the day. So couldn't someone have told Stephen Sommers that it was time to lay down the pen and let someone else write this? That way, we might have got a plot that made the slightest bit of sense. And don't tell me that doesn't matter - that might be true if your name is Monty Python, but this is trying to be a fairly serious movie, and half the time even God couldn't work out what was going on.2. Characters. Movies work better with characters that we care about, rather than boring, one-dimensional tortured heroes/heroines, cutesy sidekicks and cardboard villains. I've seen all these characters before, and I didn't care about them the last time, either.3. Dialogue. In seventy years, we've gone from 'Creatures of the night - what sweet music they make' to 'We are both part of the same great game, Gabriel! But we need not find ourselves on opposing sides of the board.' And that line was ripped off from The Man With The Golden Gun anyway, which brings me to....4. Recycling. For paper cups it's good, for movies less so. The movie starts with Frankenstein's monster, which is about right, since this whole film is about seven other films stitched together. There are bits of Bond movies, bits of vampire movies, bits of everything you've ever seen, just about. Original ideas? Nah, sorry, we're out of those. Have some leftovers from old Hammer Horror movies instead. Defenders of this movie will likely claim that this is Stephen Sommers paying a homage to movies of the past. It isn't. It's him grabbing great big handfuls of past movies and stuffing them into this unholy mish-mash.5. Pointless CGI. Lots and lots and lots of CGI. And then some more. Even in scenes that don't need it at all - for example, Mr Hyde didn't need to be a ropey-looking CGI giant, he could have been just Robbie Coltrane, only made a bit larger. You know, like the Harry Potter movies did it. Instead we had one of the most unconvincing fight scenes ever. CGI only works if it's used in the service of a good story, or if it's genuinely jaw-dropping stuff. Neither is the case here, and that's true of way too many recent movies.6. Cracked actors. Good lord, but there are some bad actors around these days. The two leads here are as good as they can be with this kind of material, but the support are often dire. Special mention goes to David Wenham, as the cute joke character who made me want to kill him after about seven seconds, and particularly Richard Roxburgh as Dracula. You have to see Roxburgh's performance to believe it. There simply aren't words in the English language to describe how shatteringly bad it is.7. All action. You are allowed to have scenes between action sequences to do stuff like characterisation, scene-setting, that sort of thing. Van Helsing just goes from one action sequence to the next, with maybe a few minutes of Basil Exposition-like waffle in between, and then.... hey, werewolves! I'm sure 12 year old boys everywhere loved this movie, and since Hollywood seems to believe that everyone in the world is a twelve-year-old boy, they'll keep making crap like this. You could have had ten Brokeback Mountains for the price of one Van Helsing, but as long as people keep coming to junk like this, Hollywood will keep making it. In the end, the market works, and audiences get the movies they deserve. Unfortunately.",Van Helsing
293,gring0,Non-stop homage to the classics,7,30 December 2007,"The kind of film I normally avoid. Being a connoisseur of the old Universal films of the 30s and early 40s, I refused to watch it out of loyalty for the franchise that Lugosi and Karloff and Chaney created. Then I happened to watch the opening scene. This movie has no plot that could engage anyone with half a brain, mixes up lore and myth (when I go to the cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris I expect to see Quasimodo, not Mr.Hyde of Edinburgh, especially as the former is at least Universal property), smothers everything in cgi, throws in one lame plot device after another to extricate itself from the holes it digs for itself etc etc etc. and yet... for someone 13 and under it is the kind of movie to be seen over and over again. Kind o like the originals (it's hard to defend the integrity of films such as Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman after all). Not one dull moment, some wonderful characterisations of old classics (I particularly enjoyed that of Dracula), a great soundtrack and some loving attentions of detail that stand out amidst the sloppy and lazy areas such as when a piece of paper obtained centuries earlier still has the exact same shape and hue as the outlying wall from which it was removed). The atmosphere too evokes something out of Karl Freund. www.lairdkeir.spaces.live.com",Van Helsing
294,aernest,"Oh, really?",3,25 January 2009,"DEFINITE SPOILER ALERT! All actors involved here hamming it up big time. OK, it's mindless fun for the most part. I even enjoyed the 007 references. There seems very little chemistry between the preternaturally attractive leads, but OK, too. I understand this movie is just camp - I really do. But can't we at least be internally consistent? Kate Beckinsale's character takes multiple slams - she falls off bridges and is repeatedly slammed HARD into stone walls, etc. by various brides, etc. But Van Helsing relatively gently knocks her onto a cushy couch and she DIES!? Come oooonnnnnnnn. And is it written in Hugh Jackman's contract that he gets an overhead shot of his holding a dead girlfriend and shouting ""NOOOO!"" in every movie? Just asking.",Van Helsing
295,eternalsea,Van Helsing the one name we can all enjoy,7,11 March 2006,"Van Helsing is Universals homage to classic monsters Dracuala, the wolfman and Frankenstein., and just for the record its a pretty darn good homage at that. The story goes as follows Van Helsing played by an effective Hugh Jackman is a monster hunter who is used by the Catholic Church to vanquish evil. He is sent to Transylvania were he meets Princess Anna played by Kate Beckinsale who whilst not exactly putting in a great performance does remain very sexy. There he finds out that her family are ruled over by an evil curse and that they will never enter heaven until the evil count dracuala is killed. The film is silly.It is not a masterpiece but it is good fun. I was not expecting to see it get a high user rating and indeed at 5.3 out of 10 it certainly doesn't however to me Van Helsing is easily a 7 due to the fact it is spectacularly enjoyable and very camp throughout. Richard Roxburugh was not an inspired choice as Dracuala as he makes quite a hash of it but everyone else is at least average in their role. In fact Hugh Jackman was born to play Van Helsing as he adds great style to a great character. I have to hand to Sommers and his crew, the movie has great effects and is well edited throughout. The script is often sharp and always silly so it is an easy movie to enjoy. Its not perfect but hell Van Helsing is one cool way to start a summer season.",Van Helsing
296,JohnBoyRoy,For fans of the classics!,7,18 May 2004,"For anybody who is familiar with the old Universal monster movies Van Helsing is a total roller-coaster, taking all of the aspects that made the vintage films great, and injecting them with LSD, speed and pyro.The CGI, firstly, is at least complete this time, unlike the decidedly PS2 graphics like SCorpion King from the Mummy sequel. Particularly impressive are the werewolf transformations and the vampiric healing abilities.Jackman carries his charisma well across the film, but unfortunately Beckinsale has none of the English charm that Sommers saw in Rachel Weisz - if only she would have done this one for him.The design and shooting of the action sequences is absolutely perfect -everything can be seen in it's full glory - it's all physically plausible (within the context of action/adventure!) and it never fails to surprise.David Wenham's character has a couple of good lines but he's generally pointless but fun (a bit like the film I suppose).A great ride with a few surprises, the film can't really be called frightening, but it's definitely worth a look for action fans and lovers of the brilliant 'The Mummy'.6/7-10",Van Helsing
297,sublime501,Don't be fooled by the trailers.,4,22 May 2004,"When VAN HELSING began, I was mildly interested. From what I had seen in the trailers, it looked pretty cool. However, maybe about halfway through the movie, I realized I was wrong.I don't even know what the movie is really about, aside from fighting vampires. But, creatures like Frankenstein's monster and werewolves have no purpose in a story about Van Helsing, a VAMPIRE hunter. And the usage of Dracula is overrated. I think we've all seen a few too many Dracula movies as it is.The action in this movie is respectable, I suppose. There's far too much rope-swinging, but the vampire creatures are pretty cool and the werewolves are pretty cool, if unnecessary to the movie. The acting is bland, and the script is pretty laughable. All of the female roles (including the beautiful Kate Beckinsale) are impossibly gorgeous, however--I'm a straight woman myself, and even I have to admit it. But aside from decent action, I don't think most people will get a lot of enjoyment out of this one.I'm sure this has been and will be called a ""roller coaster ride"" many times, but I don't agree. It's actually pretty boring... kind of more like the kids' version of a log ride. Not worth your time. 4/10.",Van Helsing
298,pulikd,Don't play with your prey!,8,17 July 2021,"""Van Helsing"" wants to have several well-known fictional characters from their own stories to be parts of one big story. And it wants to give that new story a cinematic shape so powerful few could possibly rival it.When introducing its characters, the movie does not have the luxury of a chain of separate ""origin"" story movies leading up to it. Therefore, it uses a lot of exposition. That exposition is character driven. Count Dracula tells Doctor Frankenstein about the grave robbery having ruined the poor scientist's reputation. That way, the audience gets to know how exactly the body parts were obtained. But Dracula does not say it for the audience to catch up on past events leading up to now, he says it to mock and humiliate his human servant. Plus, Dracula has his own plans for the creature, plans he has not made known until just now. And that is just one example of how this film deals with exposition. A lot has to be said, but none of it is said only for the audience, it does not break the fourth wall. More than that, the movie is self-aware and does not pretend to be something it isn't, even resorting to being cynical of itself at certain points. Like when somebody asks why Dracula is a creature that really needs to be destroyed, apart from the danger he poses. Or like when somebody tells a villain they should do things, not talking about doing them.A lot of action takes place with our heroes surviving regardless of how crazy it may look. That is a dangerous move to make because these individuals might just lose their humanity, and the audience will not take any of it seriously. But let's take just one example, the scene where Van Helsing first meets the three ""brides"". When the action is over, the heroes are shown to be exhausted. They have been fighting extremely hard and it shows. They are not invincible, they hurt and suffer. Yes, the movie does boast big action and stunts, but it does not turn the heroes immune to damage. And the sense of humor really comes in handy. But it is not misplaced, and the danger is serious, especially with how powerful the main villain is. The movie does an impressive job making him seemingly impossible to beat. But even so, he isn't just a big bad monster that wants to do bad things. He has a personality and a motivation. I have read ""Frankenstein"" and I have read ""Dracula"". I enjoyed them both. In this movie, they are not what they were in their novels, but the new takes are impressive both visually and in terms of the plot. Frankenstein's creature, Count Dracula and the werewolves are all interconnected.The easiest thing is praising the visuals and the music. Suffice it to say they are great. This is a worthy rival to Coppola's ""Dracula"" in that regard. Only this isn't a horror movie and it isn't romance based, even though it does have some. This is adventure, excitement and awe.",Van Helsing

300,jctundis,Pure Torture!,1,11 May 2004,"I cannot believe people can actually defend this piece of garbage (unless they work for the stuidio). I actually love B-movies. I love sci-fi, horror and fantasy. I was not looking for a challenging brain-teaser of a movie, or a dramatic tour de force. I was looking for a reason to get high, kick back, and enjoy a special effects laden, fun movie. And so the nightmare began... First off, the script and acting are both terrible. This comes as no surprise, and I expected nothing more. Second-- the special effects were pathetic! I could create better CGI on my home computer! It was so poorly rendered I found it difficult to believe this was a professional production! (Except for some of the Mr. Hyde scene). So, I have to pin my hopes on some good action and directing. Well,  I got neither. There are basically 2 action sequences repeated over and over and over, with I believe 2 pieces of music repeated over and over and over... My god it was so boring! My wife actually had to wake me up saying ""Oh no-- you can't make me suffer through this by myself"" ""But it was you're idea hon-- you're the big Hugh Jackman fan"" I wish I had walked out. I really do. There's no payoff, no redemption. It is an endless downward spiral of bad production values, terrible acting, and boredom. OH THE BOREDOM! Most disappointing film EVER!",Van Helsing
301,shadowycat,Van Helsing: Is It All That?,7,6 May 2004,"The quick answer is yes, it IS all that.I was so tired from work I nearly fell asleep, but not because it was boring... I was just tired.  Make no mistake, this is a 4 star classic as far as animated live-action movies go. They went for great screen classic. In fact... and I do not mean this sarcastically, one gets the feeling they wrote up their all-time list of favorite film scenes on 3x5 cards and then re-wrote these scenes and wove them into the story. Clicked on Final Draft's Vampire template and whacked their story into shape.While that aspect felt a little contrived, they pull it off, so if you like CG you're in for a great ride.Watch for the very well-executed homage to classic horror genre in the opening sequence, and then keep score of the nods to such films like as Wizard of Oz, Star Wars, Ghost, Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Fifth Element, LOTR, The Matrix, Aliens, James Bond, Alice in Wonderland, Batman, Spider-man, Crouching Tiger/Hidden Wires, the Hulk -- elements of all these films abound. Hulk because we think ILM used the same root level CG figures for some of the Van Helsing characters... that unmistakably squat froglike quality that digital Hulk had? No question, they used the same engine to drive Dr. Jeckyll and the Wolfman.There were also some wonderful drones that reminded me of steam age jawas. Or perhaps more like steam age ugnaughts. Kate B. kept making me think of a low-budget Catherine Zeta Jones, and Dracula's brides reminded me of Glinda the Good Witch's appearances also in Oz. Everything was like something, come to think of it... but it was vibrant and lush, only the cheezy end sequence was cheap. Some very good LITTLE touches.  The critics are probably going to be tough, but I bet it's gonna do boffo b.o. - I envision teenaged girls weeping at the sappy tacked on ending, and OMG the video game is gonna be very fun - especially from the dracula's bride character vantage - night vision mode where you can see the blood pumping in people's veins.

302,Macabro,Boring and Disappointing,6,10 May 2004,"After viewing the trailer some months ago I thought this was going to be a good film.  I am completely aware of all the trash that the big studios produce nowadays... somehow I thought this would be different, but instead it turned into a boring film with obnoxious one-liners and too much CGI. 
Now, the actor that played Dracula just didn't fit.  Dracula is suppose to be a dark-powerful being and inspire fear and respect, as well as sex appeal.  Even with all the CGI this Dracula did none of the above.
Dr. Jekill/Mr. Hyde also seemed to be extra, it could have been a deleted scene.CGI is another factor that bothered me.  It's good to have special effects in films, but when it's overdone it looses the effect.  Whatever happened to the make-up department?   In the old days there were films that portrayed vampires, zombies or other evil entities simply with make-up effects; some looked fake and stupid, but others were truly terrifying.I suggest to any serious film enthusiast to stay away from Van Helsing.

The one advise i can give anyone is : don't take it too seriously, don't think too much about the story and just sit down and enjoy; then you'll have a great time; perhaps a bit more humor in the movie would have made it even more enjoyable.

Like so many legends these days, they are either updated or totally redone, from King Arthur to Batman; what you see in the movies usually differ drastically from the legendary heroes.Overall, this movie was fast paced with implied gore and a nice ending, for those not too hardened by all these revenge movies and reality based dramas; a nice adrenaline rush, like Van Helsing, is a great change of pace!",Van Helsing

The main problem is the lack of jokes. It is even worse than Carry on Screaming, which did, at least, have the great Fenella Fielding. To see how it should be done just watch ""Young Frankenstein"" - the ""help me with the bags"" scene is a cinema classic. Even ""Dead and loving it"" was better, although Lysette Anthony kept her clothes on, and isn't as beautiful as Kate Beckinsale.

Clichéd without being amusing, this is an homage to nothing but bad film-making. Where The Mummy series romped, Sommers' offering stumbles like a newborn deer.

You're hurting my ears!,6,24 May 2004,"As we might all have guessed before setting foot inside the cinema, Van Helsing very quickly and very loudly proclaims that it comes from the same director as the two recent Mummy films. Stephen Sommers appears to be entirely incapable of understanding tension, character development or indeed quiet moments of any sort, and succeeds in spending the entire film slapping on sound and visual effects in such thick layers that the audience becomes stupefied.Aside from a few original and interesting bits - the characterisation of Frankenstein's creature and Igor, the James Bond spoofery at the beginning, the exploding mini-vampires - it's also a film that relies almost entirely on cliche. Sommers just can't help himself using tired camera angles and hackneyed script, and seems to have asked his composer to add 'atmospheric' (lazy) string music to just about every scene. He's also not averse to constantly reusing ideas once he's had them: people screaming/shouting ""Van Helsing!"" and people being thrown into walls appear to be among his favourites, and there are so many instances of Van Helsing's sidekick doing/saying something reluctant/cowardly, that it just stops being funny.Sommers needs to learn a few lessons from Steven Spielberg - how to loosen up a little and let the audience become interested in the characters, and how bombarding us with surround-sound bangs and screams from beginning to end is not the best way to make an action film.",Van Helsing

But Emmerich is much higher quality, and this is not a praise for him...",Van Helsing
315,MikeSmash,"Jackman & Beckinsale star in mediocre ""Van Helsing""",5,19 July 2006,"Even with star power & great special effects,""Van Helsing"" does little to enthrall moviegoers or take in big bucks at the box office. Seen more as a tribute to classic horror films such as The Werewolf(Lon Chaney) & Dracula(Bela Legosi), ""Van Helsing"" just does not have the ""bite"" that hardcore sci-fi/horror/adventure fans love. The performances of hunk Hugh Jackman(X-Men) & Kate Beckinsale(Underworld) are mediocre at best while Richard Roxburgh as Count Vladislaus Dracula stole the film. David Wenham(Lord of the Rings) provided some comedy relief while the rest of the cast seemed to fade into the scenery. ""Van Helsing"" will please some, but the most fickle of film goers will scoff at the acting performances & cheesy storyline.""Van Helsing"" chronicles the adventures of Gabriel Van Helsing(Jackman), Vatican orphan & monster hunter. Upon an unsuccessful mission in Paris to capture Mr. Hyde(Robbie Coltrane), Van Helsing returns to the Vatican to meet with Cardinal Jinette(Alun Armstrong) for his most important mission ever. With bumbling friar Carl(David Wenham) by his side, Van Helsing travels to Transylvania to destroy the fiendish Count Vladislaus Dracula & loyal assistant Igor(Kevin J. O'Connor), who plans to unleash his offspring onto the world to feed. In order to complete his evil plan, Dracula must have Dr. Frankenstein's monster's energy in order to bring his vampire babies to life. After fighting off Dracula's brides & the Werewolf(Anna's brother, Velken),Van Helsing, Anna, & Carl attempt to hide Frankenstein's monster from Dracula & his minions. They are attacked by the Werewolf & Dracula's brides, escape, but Van Helsing is bitten by the the Werewolf. To make matters worse, Anna is kidnapped & taken to Dracula's castle & Frankenstein's monster is captured. Van Helsing & Carl successfully save Anna but are over matched by vampires.Not discouraged, the three heroes find a way to follow Dracula to his remote stronghold to save Frankenstein's monster & the world from certain doom. With a torn piece of a magical painting & his mystical ring, friar Carl finds out how to kill Dracula & the way for Van Helsing to do it. Since bitten by the Werewolf, Van Helsing will turn when the full moon rises & will be able to destroy Dracula. Dracula owns the potion to rid Van Helsing of his curse of lycanthropy. But first, three have to get the antidote from a well-guarded room in Dracula's castle. Once the three are transported to Dracula's castle, Carl & Anna get the antidote with Igor's help & Van Helsing goes after Dracula. Once transformed into a werewolf, Van Helsing battles Dracula to the death. Van Helsing triumphs, thus destroying Dracula's offspring. Tragically, Van Helsing attacks Anna and kills her while she attempted to inject him with the serum. Van Helsing & Carl burn her body in proper fashion on a great mountain near her village. Van Helsing, grieving Anna's death, looks on to new adventures.Not a bad flick but has too many low points. Jackman & Beckinsale work okay together but have no romantic chemistry. Only great CG & scene-stealing Richard Roxburgh keep this film afloat. Give ""Van Helsing"" a look but do not expect a lot.",Van Helsing
316,dgeer80,"A fun ride, but flawed.",6,25 May 2004,"Let me first say that I'm a huge fan of the old 1930's and 40's Universal monsters. My dad, who grew up on those films, introduced them to me when I was pretty young. Bela Lugosi's Dracula, Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster, and Lon Chaney Jr.'s Wolf Man were some of my favorites (along with the Invisible Man and The Mummy).So when I heard about Van Helsing, and saw the previews, I was excited. I knew Steve Sommers loved those old movies. And judging from what we got with his ""Mummy"" flicks a few years back, I was expecting Van Helsing to be the same kind of film: An updated version of old monsters with a roller-coaster ride plot. Well that's what we got, but it wasn't as good as Sommer's Mummy films.First of all, their were some plot problems. There's a scene where Van Helsing's horse carriage with six horses pulling it along jumps a broken bridge over a huge ravine that they never would've made it over if actual laws of gravity were applied. It almost looked like the horses were flying like Santa's reindeer. It reminded me of when the bus jumped an incomplete highway in ""Speed."" Never would happen. OK, the carriage didn't quite make it over. It crashed onto the edge of the other side of the ravine. But neither the horses nor Van Helsing should've made it across. Not only that, but they were a decoy, so ANOTHER six horse carriage was behind them carrying the passengers they were trying to save, while Van Helsing was actually a diversion for possible vampires on the road. So they must have ALSO jumped the same impossible jump as Van Helsing did! And their carriage DID make it! Either that, or there was another complete bridge somewhere else. But even then, the timing would be near impossible for the real carriage to end up pretty much right behind Van Helsing's carriage to help him out.Second, Van Helsing gets bitten by a the Wolf Man, thus he has to become a werewolf himself during the next full moon at midnight. OK cool. However, a plot point that's never really established well is that supposedly the only way to kill Dracula (not vampires in general, but just Dracula) is by a werewolf killing him. This is something new in Vampire lore, since usually Dracula (as well as any other vampire) could be killed by driving a steak through his heart and chopping his head off, or by burning his coffin. So since in this movie it's established that the only way is by a werewolf, they need to tell us WHY. Whenever introducing a new plot point, it must be defined. If it was the usual steak through the heart thing, I'd buy it since that's been in Vampire lore forever. But alas, this is not the case. I can buy that Dracula has to be killed a different way than other vampires because he's the most powerful of them all. He gave his soul directly to the devil to make himself a vampire, whereas all others are just turned into one by being bitten by another vampire. But giving no explanation for a new method of killing him was a mistake.Another minor flaw was that when Dracula confronts Van Helsing for a duel, it conveniently turns midnight and the full moon comes into view. It would be fine if we were given more of a countdown during scenes. But the way the movie portrays it, it's by happy chance that it conveniently turns midnight just as Dracula confronts Van Helsing for a duel.Lastly, the CGI. Now, I'm a firm supporter of CGI, and I think it's a great tool. So it really takes a lot for me to actually criticize it. Steven Sommers tends to use CGI in unnecessary places. And in this movie, not only does he do that, but the CGI itself is rendered poorly. The Mr. Hyde character at the beginning suffered from what the ""Hulk"" suffered from as a CGI character. It just looked fake and cartoony. I hate saying that, because a lot of CGI in films like Lord of the Rings, the Jurassic Park series and the Star Wars films look great and are very convincing. But in ""Van Helsing,"" the Mr. Hyde character just didn't look real. His character was done better in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (which I thought was cool), because they used actual prosthetics and just blue screened him onto the frames with other characters to make him look huge. Much more convincing. This is the way he should've been done for Van Helsing. CGI should only be used when there's no other convincing way to do the effect one is trying to achieve. And if it's used, it should be given the same care that was given to Gollum in LOTR, the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, or the CGI aliens in the Star Wars films. Those creatures and effects were convincing. Hyde was not.Well, enough of the flaws. This movie was fun. The overall plot was cool. David Wenham's friar character was great comic relief. The CGI for the Wolf Man and the vampire effects was done pretty well. The atmosphere was very dark and moody. The Frankenstein monster was done right. He was the best character in the film. Thankfully, his character was created with prosthetic make-up. If he was done in CGI and only given the amount of care that was given to Mr. Hyde, he would've suffered the same fate of looking fake. Dracula's character was cool. I loved how him and his brides walked on the walls and the ceilings. He even had the romanian accent, which was a nice touch. I also like the ballroom scene. It's filled with people, and we see Dracula dancing with Anna Valerious amidst the crowd. There's a big mirror they look into while dancing, and she's the only one visible. Suddenly we realize that the room is filled with vampires since no one else casts a reflection! That was a nice touch. Lastly, I loved the opening scene with Dr. Frankenstein screaming ""It's alive, ALIVE!"" That scene was filmed in black and white, and it even had the monster rushing up into a windmill with angry villagers with torches burning it down just like the old classics!So overall, I give this film a 6 out of 10. It was fun, but definitely flawed.",Van Helsing
317,meako1973,What a turkey!,1,6 May 2004,"Van Helsing is a popular character from literature, and indeed the movies. The arch-nemesis of Count Dracula, he has always been portrayed as a middle aged gentleman, with a few eccentricities (none more so than in Coppola's Dracula film when Anthony Hopkins played him as a total loon.)  Now, the character has been stolen and changed by Mummy writer and director, Stephen Sommers, to be portrayed as a younger action hero, who hunts not only the legendary Count but also every other supernatural monster which stalks the earth.  Much in the same way that other famous characters from literature were altered for The league of Extraordinary Gentlemen.Every now and again, a film comes along which is designed to just be a popcorn' movie, putting bums on seats, and throwing action and adventure at you.  This, I think, is one of them.  If this wasn't the intention of Sommers, then he has made one heck of a turkey of a film! The plot is weak at the best of times, being that Dracula is using werewolves to hunt his enemies, whom he wants to use in Frankenstein type of experiments.  Van Helsing is sent by the Vatican to sort him out.  The dire-logue (sic) is awful, with really forced exposition done in a pantomime style (I resisted the urge to shout `He's behind you' on a few occasions), and this shows that Sommers is perhaps only slightly better at script writing than a certain George Lucas.  Sommers' last two films, Mummy and Mummy Returns, both suffered from the same sloppy writing, so the pattern is starting to show. However, Van Helsing isn't really a total disaster.  Despite the ropey acting and the terrible script, it is a success, in a `leave your brain, common sense, and desire for a good story at the door' kind of way.  Indeed the action comes so thick and fast that just as the tedious talky bits start to drag, BANGaction kicks in and you just sit back and accept it.Effects wise (because at the end of the day, that is all a Sommers film is about) it treads the line between impressive (castles, scenery, wolfmen), and dreadful CGI (people swinging from castles, bat-creatures, cows)  This lack of consistency in the effects is, perhaps, the one thing which lets the action down at times as it becomes harder to suspend disbelief (which is bad enough when people can fall great heights without breaking limbs, or even a sweat!)  Visually superb, but overall let down by some rushed effects.Overall, it wasn't a completely wasted 2 hours.  The film was marginally more enjoyable than Tomb Raider, and Torque.  I will no doubt buy it sometime down the line on DVD (probably when it is in a 3 for £20 offer at HMV).  But I can't really be bothered watching it again on the big screen, despite having plenty of opportunity, which I think speaks volumes about the film.",Van Helsing

I didn't feel 'offended' watching it, but.....it could of been a lot better.There seems to be a disagreement though whether the film was supposed to be a family horror romp, or a stylish legend thriller. I hope that the director had 'tongue-in-cheek' in mind when he was creating this... because if he didn't....I quite like sort of vampires and stuff so that dragged this film up to a 4 for me = just enjoyable and no more. I thought the acting was alright but the story was just too much at times. I think the director just crammed in too many characters; vampires, werewolves, frankensteins and a whole host of other stuff.The standout aspect for me though, which I believe does deserve to be congratulated is the sets/location-cgi.

Basically, the movie looks nice graphically speaking, and the special effects live up to Sommers expectations, but stunts are repeated over and over again. We are not in Tarzan and yet Van Helsing strangely ressembles Tarzan, dudes just keep hanging on stuff, and moving from wire to wire, this is very annoying. The constant screaming of so-called Vampire wives is also a pain to the ears. The plot is incredibly stupid, this movie is just useless, we would live well without it. Laws of physics are broken, i.e. the horse and chariot jump over the broken bridge, which is very highly unlikely. Horses are not that stupid, they would stop before kamikaze jumping into a pit.

We first see Van Helsing going toe to toe in Paris with Mr Hyde, vicious alter ego of Dr Jeckyl. Hyde is huge and orge-like, voiced by Robbie Coltrane and done completely in CGI. I liked this movie. Hugh jackman has a highly likable screen presence ( i think if he kicked Little Red Riding Hood to death and then machine gunned Bambi i would still like him ). Kate Becknsale is very beautiful and kicks ghoulish butt with the best of 'em. Richard Roxborough makes a deliciously camp Dracula. The three actresses to play the brides of Dracula ( Silvia Colloca, Josie Maran, Elena Anya) are a standout- sexy and scary- they were quite unnerving in places, particularly with the glowing eyes and the sadistic laughter. 'Oklahoma' star Shuler Hensley made Frankenstein's monster a pitiable wretch behind the mask. David Wenham was funny as the bumbling Q- like monk who provides Van Helsing with the gadgets. The special effects were top notch, the werewolf was brilliant, and the fight between Van Helsing/werewolf and Dracual/bat thing was well done. i loved the evil little Dwergi waddling about the old castle. In short this movie has a high watchability factor, helmed by Stephen Summers ( a fan of the old RKO horror movies) with evident affection for the movies he spoofs, putting plenty of 'in-jokes' for fans to spot.

Although the CGI effects just keep getting better and better when you watch an older movie it was so much more tense when you knew it was an actual person doing the stunt. I'd like them to do a Wolfman movie with a more serious take on it as the opening Wolfman capture was quite exciting. I guess this was okay for todays 13 year-olds, probably even 10 year olds.

It seems like I was watching a 2 hour trailer for an ego-shooter. All the authors of the original monster-literature (Frankenstein, Dracula, Dr. Jeckyl & Mr. Hyde, Werewolf, ... ) must be turning in their graves. The movie butchered them all for some cheap visual effects (and when I say cheap, I mean CHEAP). The computer graphics were thoroughly unconvincing - partially even worse than in 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. Plot and Character-development were next to non-existent. When the heroine dies there was not one tear in the house - nobody cared. The character was just developed that badly. The end fight was totally anti-climatic. The plot as illogical and contradictory as it can get (and I am not including monsters and vampire-hunters into 'illogical'). The stunts? Totally unbelievable (yeah... right, we fight in high heeled boots, jump all over the place and land after a 50 foot drop on our feet..uh huh). Jackman does his wolverine-shtick. Nothing new there. The comedic-sidekick didn't have one line  that wasn't totally lame. Who wrote this stuff?Oh yeah, speaking of comedic sidekick. The movie was so full of cliches that it hurt. Right down to the hero and his pal riding off into the sunset. I would have almost blown chunks at that point. The 'story' seemed ripped from a book called 'how to write a movie plot in 5 minutes'. Boooooring.What is there left to say? Normally when I don't like a movie I at least tell people to go watch it on DVD and make up their own mind.

Unfortunately, a hero of the most predictable Hollywood kind.I can't see serious horror fans giving this re-hash of well-known themes kudos. Still, for a mainstream film-goer like myself, I found enjoyment and relaxation in a well-paced adventure. A thoughtful screenplay keeps the action coming, while there's many an exciting aerial shot. Sumptuous costumes, props and locations complete a satisfying visual experience. Although CGI runs riot in this movie, at some points it works rather well. Dracula's flying brides, for example, look stunning, at least when airborne.The script, such that it is, veers between cheesy one liners and brisk conversation. Dialogue is mostly confined to moving action forward, so has a ""comic book"" feel. Inventive plot points get overshadowed due to this approach.Beckinsale and O' Connor (who played a similar entertaining villain in the Mummy films) do their best to entertain, while David Wenham and Shuler Hensley are pitch perfect and well-cast.

If a film doesn't provide a plot more complex than the flight of an arrow, or dialogue more realistic than a video game (except in the case of ExistenZ), it's most likely going to be a disappointment in my book (unless it matches the sheer primordial success of The Matrix).

The art direction and effects are fantastic, and made me believe that this gothic fantasy land could actually have existed at one time. It gives the movie a style and beauty all its own, and if this were an arthouse film, that would be enough.

If you're going to use CG use it when you really have to, if it costs way too much to do the real deal or the model costs too much or you can make the image look very realistic (I know, it can't be perfect, but damn close to it is possible these days). LXG had this problem as well and it seems like the makers of Van Helsing didn't learn from LXG's mistakes.The story, acting, cinematography were pretty good. Not amazing, but pretty good. Directing seemed kind of rushed to me as though Stephen Sommers just wanted to get to the next CGI scene or action scene.The Mummy was an awesome movie.

""It has a promising leading duo and a lot of monsters, so how bad can it be?"" Well, the answer turned out to be: utter crap. Two major problems: the script is awful (which should not surprise anyone, and this alone would not trouble this sort of movie at all), and the cast is horrible. Two notable exceptions are Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale: Jackman is a fine choice for the leading role, but he is not given much to work with, and Beckinsale looks nice and spicy, but she's given nothing else to do. They also seem to have absolutely no chemistry between them. The rest of the cast is so recklessly awful you'd be hard pressed to find such lack of talent in the most backward theatre of the planet.Richard Roxburgh is the worst Dracula ever, by a margin the size of the moon. Apparently his vision was that Dracula became such a loathed figure because of his loud-mouthed, goofy manners. He is a complete failure, as the performance is stupid, annoying as hell, and yet not at all funny. And it gets worse: both Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor and Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's monster do their very best to top Roxburgh in a half-witted noisy overacting contest. AND they all are outplayed by Dracula's brides, who hiss, make faces and screech like rabid wombats.There is nothing entertaining. There is nothing scary. There is nothing funny. There is just a lot of pointless CGI and an abundance of annoyingly bad performances. This is not brainless fun, this is just brainless.3/10 (P.S. Oh, and the score which some people here seem to claim makes this movie. If you have seen more than 20 movies, you have practically heard this soundtrack, only probably a better version of it. The score is nothing else but an uninspired two-a-penny variation of the most clichéd string arrangements for spectacle-type movies. It does in no way break the film -- it is probably the closest call to a proper element this movie has -- but most definitely it also does not make this film.)",Van Helsing
338,basemnt-dwellr,BORING,3,12 May 2004,"I wanted to watch the movie although I had heard a lot of bad things about the film. Unfortunately all those things are true. The opening sequence (shot in black and white) is quite okay, but after that it gets worse. When in the beginning of the movie Van Helsing fights some Hulk-like monster I was already bored and thought ""just kill it and let's get over with"", but unfortunately the fight lasts quite a while. I could not at all relate with the characters, neither with Van Helsing nor with Anna Valerious, even Count Dracula remains bland and uninteresting. Besides you don't learn anything about their motivation. Also the fact that Van Helsing mostly fights CGI-beings and does not get even a scratch during those fights does not exactly further the tension. In addition the movie is quite foreseeable. And Carl as Van Helsing's sidekick/comic relief is not funny at all and the one liners the characters get to speak are just stupid. The only reason I didn't leave the cinema before the end of the movie was that I was curious about the final fight between Count Dracula and Van Helsing, but even that fight was not worth the wait.The acting was okay I think, but I had the impression that in a bad movie even decent actors look bad.The CGI was way too much, human adversaries might have been much more interesting to watch, so it was more like style over substance. Maybe they should have saved the money they spent on the CGI and invested it in a decent script instead.",Van Helsing
339,Motoko,Hysterical fun offered for those prepared to accept it...,7,25 May 2005,"OK. Deep breath. Reputation about to be destroyed. Career as reviewer gone.I liked Van Helsing.No, no, no! Let me explain. I think it's awful. The script is terrible. The plot non-existent. It's all just an excuse for some action sequences to be tied together. Now, here's my point: what's wrong with that? I am beginning to rail against the pre-defined notion that all films have to be a Citizen Kane type experience. They must aspire to be the ultimate cinematic achievement they can be. The storyline must be Shakespearean in scope. The dialogue must be a gift from Mamet. The performances must give De Niro sleepless nights for months.Not always.Sometimes they can just be fun. And that's what Van Helsing is, it's fun. It's ridiculous, it's hokey, it's silly. But by God, sat in that darkened theatre watching Frankenstein's Monster swing on a rope, Dracula do bloody battle with a Werewolf and the Brides camp it up like harpies possessed, you've just got to roll with it and laugh.You want to be po-faced? Hell you could rip this to pieces. Nothing makes any sense. The story is riddled with contrivances and conveniences too numerous to mention. Vampire and werewolf lore is shown the nearest exit and told to be cool or else. The dialogue is so cheesy, even Karloff would die of shame saying it. But here's the point. The film doesn't care.Not in a self-aware kind of way you understand. This isn't some post modern exercise in hip irony. Hugh Jackman doesn't wink at the camera. Roxborough doesn't let the mask slip and reveal that he knows it's all bunkham. You know why? Because they're having fun too! And director Stephen Sommers? He's bouncing up and down in his little directors chair smacked out on sugar having the time of his life playing with the biggest toy set money can buy.This is clearly a labour of love for Sommers. At the end of the credits is the note 'For My Father.' You just know that when he was 9 Sommers watched every universal Horror movie at least 25 times and lapped it up. He watched them with his father and talked about how cool it would be if the Monsters all met up for a big fight and what would happen. This is that film. This is the film a fan makes. This is the film an obsessive makes to honour the memory of watching monster movies with his father.Now, I can hear people whispering ""if he wanted to honour Dracula and Frankenstein he should have made a serious adaptation of the books rather than urinating all over Shelley and Stoker's prose and turning them into a funfair ride."" Point taken and accepted. But Sommers doesn't care about the books. He cares about the films. He cares about Karloff and Legosi and Lon Chaney Jr. He cares about damsels being captured and villagers carrying blazing torches and pitchforks and silver and transformations. He cares about the joy of watching a monster create carnage. You want to delve into the sexual awakening of young women in a suffocating society? Or explore the male masturbation fantasy of creating life without the help of woman kind? Move along please, nothing to see here. You want to watch vampires attack a coach travelling at breakneck speed though the Transylvanian forest carrying Frankenstein's Monster with a Werewolf in hot pursuit? Step right this way.Van Helsing is not a great film. It's debatable whether or not it's even a good film. But it most definitely is a fun film. And sometimes, that's all you need.",Van Helsing
340,daisuke69,"bland, predictable, bad acting... get the picture?",3,16 January 2005,"This is one of the more forgettable movies I have seen in a while... The movie is fun... I'll give it that, but so many things are overdone that the whole effort comes across as being way over the top. And the normally talented Kate Beckinsale's Romanian accent is scarcely believable. Most of the characters in fact are either cliché or pulled off very badly, especially Dracula, he looks so much like professor snape from harry potter that I expected him to pull out a wand at any moment. If you want a real Dracula look at gary oldman's incredible performance and the makeup job they did on him, THAT's a scary Dracula. Special effects are OK, adherance to reality isn't. There aren't many movies that make me shake my head in disbelief, but this is one of them.The splicing of almost all the major horror characters of the days of old is also something worth mentioning, the only one missing is the mummy, and fortunately they didn't put him in there. I guess they didn't have the creativity to come up with a decent plot so instead they just cut and paste a bunch of done-to-death characters together in the hope of coming up with something ""new"".All in all a pitiful attempt at a monster movie that will soon be forgotten. The best way to watch this thing is get it for free somewhere with free rental, and then watch it at a frat house with generous amounts of beer in between.",Van Helsing
341,jessejace,play castlevania instead,3,14 February 2005,"The first scene is a campy black-and-white scene involving Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein. I was so confused by this scene; at first I thought it was going to be some kind of movie-within-movie or frame story or something. At the very least, I expected a reveal that would bring reason to the campy acting and unlikely character relationships. It HAD to be intentional. Didn't it?Apparently not. The next thing I saw was a dead-serious title card reading ""ONE YEAR LATER."" From that moment, I knew it was going to be a long couple of hours.Sure enough, this movie is packed shoulder to shoulder, start to finish with actors who, for whatever reason, aren't acting. You've got Hugh Jackman over here, making wry comments and being oh, so clever. You've got this horrendously unmenacing Dracula and his community theater reject wives (who spend more than fifty percent of their on screen time as computer-generated harpies without nipples). You've got dudes transforming from naked werewolves into humans with pants.The design Van Helsing's character is not bad, but it's a little too close to Vampire Hunter D. The film has but two saving graces, and those are Frankenstein's Monster and....hmmm. Sorry, the film has only one saving grace. And in this particular case, he failed to completely save the movie, so for all we know, the movie has NO saving graces. So reading this paragraph has just been a waste of your time.The idea of a story that binds Dracula, Igor, Frankenstein's Monster and werewolves is appealing, to be sure. That's why there have been so many video games made on that premise. But we shouldn't judge movies and games by the same standards, and anyone who does needs to be kicked in the face. If they were trying to make Castlevania into a movie, they should have just called it Castlevania: The Movie.",Van Helsing

We won't be buying this movie, we won't see any sequels, and we wish we'd chosen to find where Hellboy was playing so we could have at least seen something that was ranked as good. We'd give this movie a 3 out of 10. Even the CGI was so fake, and so contrived, it just didn't bring the movie up in our esteem at all.

345,nixar55,Cover your eyes...,1,19 August 2004,"Not because this movie is scary in any amount, but because it is unwatchable.I loved those old Universal monsters, they were classics. To see the memory of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney spit on with this over-hyped piece of celluloid trash was bad enough, but this film had not one thing going for it to make the effort worthwhile. I liked Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, when he showed some charisma, but his role here was completely dull and by-the-numbers standard action fare. Kate Beckinsdale's accent was so laughable. Even David Wenham, who I ADORED in Lord of the Rings and his indie Aussie films, was awful as a sniveling sidekick. I actually felt embarrassed for him. Dracula was...ugh. Words cannot do it justice. The vampire brides were even worse. Where did they find those girls? A community theater? I thought vamps' fangs were for blood-sucking, not gnawing their way through scenery.The storyline was so convoluted, I wished I could watch the pitch meeting for Van Helsing instead. ""So Dracula...needs electricity from Frankenstein to...bring about evil! Yeah, and there's the Wolfman, and Hyde, and...EXPLOSIONS and junk."" I'm not a movie snob, and I enjoy summer action blockbusters (I loved Riddick, which didn't take itself as seriously as Van Helsing.) But this movie didn't even have good FX. Also lacking was an interesting hero and at least one memorable scene. What a waste. I haven't cringed so much in a theater since...Mission Impossible 2, I guess.",Van Helsing
346,jxmakela,Hilariously bad,3,8 June 2004,"20 years from now, I'll probably be able to watch this train wreck of a movie again after a few drinks and laugh at it. I admit that I did get a few laughs this time around, too, but mostly I was just groaning in frustration.The worst Dracula ever, the worst Frankentein's monster ever, the stupidest phallic big gun ever, and worst acting ever from Beckinsale and Jackman. It's a good thing that the director decided to focus on shots of Beckinsale's butt bouncing up and down instead of her acting, so there weren't too many of those ""I've never been to the sea"" moments.All the performances are pitiful, but one of them stands above the rest in its sheer stupidity: David Wenham, who plays a retarded idiot for the benefit of other retards in the audience so they can laugh at him. He was the only one I felt sorry for. The story is so nonsensical it seems as if they were making it up as they went along. There is, of course, a half-baked love story of sorts between Jackman and Benkinsale, but it's there just because it has to, not because it makes sense in any way. The ending will leave you wondering whether to laugh or cry. In every way, Van Helsing is light years behind Hellboy, the other recent supernatural popcorn thriller.

347,Moonhawk1975,Van Helsing,7,7 April 2005,"The fearless vampire killer (Hugh Jackman) is sent to Transylvania to seek out Anna (Kate Beckinsale) and aid her in her quest to rid the countryside of Dracula (Richard Roxburgh). Once there, he encounters the evil Count's diabolical plot tohave children! Yes, the movie is as goofy as it sounds. Director Stephen Sommers has entirely done away with any attempts to scare the audience and made an action fantasy out of the classic horror characters. The movie opens rather poorly, with Van Helsing tracking Mr. Hyde into Notre Dame and subsequently killing him. The action is sluggish, the one-liners are lame and the computer effects are lame. After the action moves to Transylvania, the movie picks up speed in a campy fashion and quickly becomes a guilty pleasure. Beckinsale, as the last in a family cursed by Dracula, is wonderful; complete with skin-tight wardrobe and overdone accent she matches Jackman's one-liners with perfect ease. Roxburgh, as Dracula, is about the only truly good performer on hand. His version of the vampire would be menacing in a movie that was not going for camp. But, if this movie had been serious it would be the complete failure many consider it to be. I don't know whether the laughs were intentional, but without them this movie would be a bomb. The three brides of Dracula are the most hilarious of all the characters, spouting lines as though they were recently kicked off a soap opera. The movie would have benefited from scaling back on the computer effects. There are so many and none are very convincing. The worst being the Mr. Hyde character, but he is not present after the first 10 minutes. The werewolf is not too good either; it is an obvious, unconvincing effect that should have been thought out more carefully before transferring it to the screen. The idea of having the skin of the human ripped off to reveal the monster underneath is very flawed; how many layers does he/it have? As with most pre-programmed summer blockbusters, check your brain at the door and you will have a good time.",Van Helsing
348,dhallen,Two hours of watching someone else play a video game.,2,15 December 2004,"This was a very disappointing movie. So much unrealized potential. The sets and scenery were fantastic, a solid 10 out of 10, but the acting and screenplay were atrocious. Why does everyone in this movie have an accent? The Count sounds like Frau Blucher from Young Frankenstein. The female vampires, that spend way to much time flying around, sound just like Lorraine Newman and Jane Curtain when they did the SNL skits featuring the female equivalents of the Ackroyd/Martin ""wild and crazy guys."" Very distracting. The screenplay starts out loud and fast, like a trashcan falling down a flight of stairs, and the action never lets up. That is too bad. The dialogue is limited to thoughts eminating from the reptilian cortex....""Let's go over there."" and ""We must stop him."" and other obvious and unnecessary bits of filler that add nothing to the non-existent story.

349,xenolupa,"Mix of the super movies. Bad mix. Bad, bad.",3,21 January 2005,"let's start with a mix of the stories of Dracula and Frankenstein. Add some eggs of Alien(s), and later on have many more. Out the eggs come Gremlins. Funny creatures. They behave really like the pixies of the Harry Potter movies, and they behave badly. There seems to be need for quite a bit from Lord of the Rings, like the maps, the horses and the nice views of snowy mountaintops. Dracula wants his ring, but is not yet calling it his precious. Add some feel and wit of Buffy and Angel episodes. Sprinkle some silly special effects and anachronisms of Wild Wild West and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Frankenstein's brain was flown in from the set of the next sequel of Silence of the Lambs. A mirror acts like a Stargate, go through it and be somewhere completely different suddenly. Some castles are moved from New Zealand, and Saruman and Sauran sorely miss them. I've seen Jack Nicholson do a better werewolf. Van can surf like Legolas, but this looks even more unbelievable. Everybody is able to perform rope-slinging like Spidey, even the lady outdoes Indiana Jones.All humans have super strength and survive blows that would kill a rhino, survive 50 yard drops that would smash the sturdiest marble.Oooh, and of course we got Faramir from LOTR, behaving silly and cowardly. And Wolverine from X-Men, behaving heroic and gentlemen-like. Rubeus Hagrid from Harry Potter is killed way too soon. M of the League is way too human and friendly to convince as a vampire. Selene of Underworld though is a good and very strong vampire killer, and how tiny is her waist, it's stunning, but it being very unpractical does of course not stop her.Ah, all ends well that ends like Ghost. No Swayze though... But the end is an invitation for a sequel. I hope it won't be made.Of course it's dark, snowing and/or raining all the time. The acting is a bit thin, it's all a caricature. The plot, well, it makes hardly any sense. The story goes ways Bram Stoker and Mary Shelley have never thought of and would certainly not approve.It's all way too silly. I give it a 3. Not a 1.

Where to start! ok, I like a good action flick as much as the next guy, but the sheer number of plot holes just made the whole picture unenjoyable. Why are so many villagers in the village with their shovels, rakes (and implements of destruction), sickles, etc. and not out in the fields? Why can't a vampire that can pick up and hurl a cow, but when a second person jumps on the legs of the first person being picked up it's 'too heavy' and they let go. Holy water sure is potent! a few drops is enough to kill a vampire (hadn't been one kilt in a hunndered years!) Why does the basin exist? If I was Dracula, I wouldn't allow holy ground/church to exist. It just goes on and on like that. I must have missed how Van Helsing was alive after so many years, I never did see much to explain that. Why can a werewolf kill Dracula and noting else can? Why can a woman take multiple falls and poundings be killed by the only bit of comfy furniture in Drac's lab(?) I think it was a particularly vicious divan. The only redeeming element in the script was the idea of drac's children and the Frankenstein 'process' tied together. Hugh Jackman tries, but we don't get enough about his character. Kate is fine, in more ways than one. The Friar and Igor were the two best characters in the movie. Drac was....a bit overdone, but I blame S.S. for that 2 out of 10.",Van Helsing

It's loud, it's full of explosions and cartoonish special effects, silly lines (especially from The Brides of Dracula), goofy humor, and Saturday morning villains. And this would be fine. Sommers did the exact same things with both of The Mummy films, and I was pleased as peach about it. Unfortunately that's not what Sommers did with Van Helsing. Sommers attempted to make a movie that was dark along with action-packed. And unfortunately, to make something dark it has to have two things: atmosphere to match and drama. I wasn't feeling the atmosphere, and the drama pushed the film past camp into irritation. To put it simply, the film was overacted in its attempt to be dark. There was one scene in particular where Dracula was having an argument (or conversation; I really couldn't tell the implied mood of the scene) with his wives, and I had no idea what was going on. There wasn't a point to the conversation, as it merely hopped from one subject to another, and it didn't help move the plot along at all. The scene was overacted in some vague attempt to stick feelings in a film otherwise devoid of it, and several other scenes mimicked this same type of structure (especially at the end). There was theme in there about not reading a book by it's cover (or something to that effect: it wasn't really hashed out until the last 30 minutes of the film), but by the end your just fed up with the overdrive into hokey mock-drama that you really don't care.

The werewolves were pretty cool, but Dracula was too flamboyant and Frankenstein's monster was just plain annoying. And it seemed like the movie would never end. It just kept going on and on -- desperately trying to revitalize itself, but to no avail.

354,Axel-9,"Silly, lacking in plot, but good fun",7,21 November 2004,"It's big, it's dumb, it's cheesy as hell, but I found it to be enormous fun. This was made to be a roller-coaster ride and by that token it should be judged.Actually after the opening pastiche of the Boris Karloff Frankenstein movie, I thought this had the potential to be a 5 star movie. It was very atmospheric and had me hooked. However the film never really captures any sense of magic from there onwards.The main body of the movie does go on a bit, and it could have done with some attempt to create engaging characters. Plot and story are not always necessary for fun movies, but you do need characters with a level of interest to capture the mind, otherwise you tend to find yourself not giving a s**t. I felt Van Helsing did verge into this territory, but for the most part it's so fast paced this doesn't matter so much. The points where it does try to introduce plot are the moments where it really does fail. In fact there is too much going on that is never really explained, and I think it would've been better not to have bothered at all, than use the nonsense Sommers resorts too. For example the attempts at backstory to Van Helsing. Better to have one of those interlude chatty scenes you have in the Indy films, where it establishes he's a dude, rather than the poor attempts at angst and pathos. Really bad was the moment he gets upset over Frankie's Monster. What the hell was that all about?Hmm maybe I took that a bit seriously, but the movie knows what it is, why try be something else. I also thought that that masked ball sequence was a natural conclusion, the eventual finale at the castle felt like an add on, which lacked any real punch.Far better was Van's introduction to Transylvania, with the benefit of some neat angles and panning shots, the crossbow battle with the brides was cool. The coach chase was exciting without being exhilarating, but kept the flow going, so it's a shame some more bad plot gets thrown in, especially when it was involving the underwritten Velkan. That's the film's main problem - overkill of characters, with little space given to any of them to evolve.Finally a word on the CGI. I thought it was very good, especially the morphs that were used. The very first moment Drac starts to turn made me jump a touch, and when the vampires turns into their fanged, contorted state it looked pretty scary to me. The wolfman transformation, with the ripping flesh looked genuinely painful. At this point I was thinking the CGI was genuinely stunning. I'd have preferred the finale if it had just been Van vs Drac though, having CGI characters fight felt uninvolving, and Drac in snarly state was far better than the beast he turns into.This is a movie to genuinely switch of the brain and enjoy. At times there's too much going on and perhaps a bit too much swinging about for my liking, but it's an adrenaline filled ride. I'd probably give it 7 out of 10.",Van Helsing

The use of CG in this film is better than anything I've seen, and the information in the DVD extras about how it was done is great.

Dracula couldnt ever have a regular conversation without climbing up the wall or causing explosions with his power, this got really annoying quick. Another thing was the story was so predictable, a 5 year old could figure it out. As soom as they found Frankenstein you knew what was going to happen and after this you're just waiting for the movie to end. They had all the right tools to make this a great movie but blew it. All they had to do was spend a little more emphasis on the plot. Then they could have eased back on the special effects. You dont have to have a big special effects scene every 15 seconds.

Jackman goes through every scene with his eyebrow cocked like this is a James Bond audition, managing to fight a variety of creatures without mussing his carefully maintained haircut. Richard Roxborough conjures up the spirit of Count Chocula in the worst Dracula performance I've ever seen, and I include the Andy Warhols, and the Spanish versions in the 70's. Frankenstein's monster spends the whole movie as the damsel in distress. The Wolf man has no characterization whatsoever. The CGI is so bad, they would have been off simply using animation. This movie is so bad, one begins to wonder if this film's financing should have simply been used to feed the hungry in some developing country instead of this forgettable waste of celluloid. Loathsome.",Van Helsing
360,fluffyclown,This movie was confused,5,7 May 2004,"I'm not sure Van Helsing knew what kind of movie it wanted to be.  It started out dark and horrific, and ended up being a comedic, action-adventure ala bond flick.The story was different then your typical vampire flick, which doesn't say much.  The CGI was terrible.  It was grossly overdone, and just looked fake. The movie would have been better if it hadn't relied so heavily on special effects.  As for acting, Hugh Jackman seemed more like a cross between Wolverine and Indiana Jones then an original character.  Kate looked great, in fact, better than she ever has, but her acting fell flat.  The best character was Frankenstein, and we didn't get to see him nearly enough.I guess all in all the movie was ok, but not really.  Considering how much money is put into films these days, it just seems like it should have turned out better then it did.My rank: 6",Van Helsing
361,fluffyclown,I can't make up my mind,5,10 May 2004,"And neither could this movie.Now I appreciate it when a movie does a good job of combining several genres, and I could see what the makers of Van Helsing were trying to accomplish.  Unfortunately that seems to be the theme of movies today. Trying.The first try was the horror aspect.  There were times when I literally jumped in my seat from fright.  At one point I almost screamed.  But these moments were so few and far between that calling this a horror film just doesn't quite fit.The next try was the CGI.  A bad try.  The effects were sloppy at best, and so over the top in their attempts to make the actors look like they were the greatest gymnasts ever born that they were laughable.  Come on moviemakers! Whatever happened to a good old fashioned fight without having to hurl characters all over the horizon?The third try was comedy.  This actually worked.  The friar who was a Q ahead of his time was hilarious.  If only we could have seen more of him and less of the action sequences!The fourth try was action-adventure.  The problem was, instead of making Van Helsing a truly original character, they made him into a Wolverine brooding, Indiana Jones wannabe who dressed like a character from the Matrix.  Now I'll give kudos to Kate.  She looked awesome.  Better then I've ever seen her.  And the vampire brides were absolutely stunning on the ground.  Too bad they turned into really bad CGI whenever they took flight.So, what did I think of the movie?  I found it trying.
Rank: 6 out of 10",Van Helsing
362,BennyM,"Alan Moore's ideas, none of his talent",8,18 May 2004,"I actually liked Van Helsing. It's a wild rollercoaster ride. And as an attempt to make something more akin to League of Extraordinary Gentlemen than Stephen Norrington's abysmally bad movie version of Alan Moore's work of genius, it worked.Unfortunately, it didn't have Alan Moore, who could have made the dialogue work too and the character motivations more interesting. But who cares - the action was what it was about, there was plenty of it, and I for one at times even sat in the cinema wishing for a RWD button to take another look at what actually happened here or there.A final aside: Now that Alan Moore has opened the can of worms that is public domain reworking of classic characters, we will see plenty of bad instances of it in the future. It's the way of the world (or Hollywood at least), and Alan Moore will regrettably never see one cent of the bazillions of dollars generated from his idea. Well, Alan Moore will most likely do very nicely on his own anyway, what with America's Best Comics and all.How many times was that? Four? Not nearly enough, so here comes another three: Alan Moore, Alan Moore, Alan Moore. The greatest writer in existence.",Van Helsing
363,Chris-742,Overdoing it.,2,25 June 2004,"This film is some mad cross between james bond, dracula, frankenstein, alien, tarzan and whatever. It's like the worst of Hollywood tackiness. Steal yourself blind taking plot elements from other films, but use them in the worst possible way. And then I have not mentioned the worst. There is simple too much special effects and action in this film, it never ever slows down. You need acting and character in a film. But special effects and action is no substitute for good acting, which we sadly see nothing off in this film. Mostly because the film doesn't pause enough to let there be acting. But also because every time someone says something, not only does that person have the most outrageous accent, but their speaking is so constructed that you wonder what kid wrote the script.Sometimes the film slows down, and you think, maybe there will be some good acting, maybe some plot, maybe this isn't a completely bad film. But no, the film soon races off, leaving unfinished plot elements and the audience behind. I wasn't the only one sighing in the theater. And there were instances of people giggling at the film, as opposed to giggling with the film. Now with a lot of work, this film could have been an amusing homage to horror films....or it could have been an amusing turkey. I wish they had cut, say 20 minutes of wire-swinging to do just that and changed the overall tone from...from..ludicrous to comedy. It wouldn't have made the film good, but it would have made it average, and possibly entertaining.There can only be one grade for this boring mess: a 1 (out of 5 or 10 either one).",Van Helsing
364,bizz-2,KATE BECKINSALE I LOVE YOU!,6,9 May 2004,"I wont discuss with anyone what VAN HELSING should have been, I'll discuss what it is...and it is a TERRIFIC piece of entertainment, an over the top action-adventure flick and, above it all, it also is the confirmation of Kate Beckinsale as the horror-film diva of the 21st century, the most beautiful, exciting and powerful presence seen on the screen since Barbara Steele.VAN HELSING is the sort of film I loved when I was 12...now I'm 32 but I still love this sort of movies if they are done with this concept in mind...The special effects are probably the best ever seen on a movie like this, the cast is almost perfect, splendid music and the screenplay...screenplay? who needs a screenplay when you are having so much fun?8/10....Great movie.",Van Helsing
365,Ihad,This movie smells like a wet dog,1,6 August 2004,"I rarely rate movies as low as 1 but Van Helsing while theoretically deserving a 4 for craftsmanship in cutting, costumes and sf/x, I cannot rate it higher than 1 due to its utmost abhorrent script - plot? what plot? - performance and feeble attempts to be funny. What happened? I did enjoy ""The Mummy"" tremendously, I even liked the ""Mummy Returns"" but this is an outrage and Kate Beckinsale - already proven to be worst actress of the year in ""Underworld"" - seems to have a fable for showing off her body instead of her acting talents, which might prove difficult as these are seemingly nonexistent.There are indeed many viewers who enjoyed this shallow pop corn flick and it's their good right to do so, but as fan of the genre I could merely wince in my chair seeing how such a potential character as Van Helsing goes to waste in yet another instalment of ""all show and no brains"".Yet it began really promising with the hunt for Mr. Hyde (very nice CGI there) but sadly these first 15 minutes are the only highlight of this movie and Richard Roxburgh seems to be only actor worth his grain of salt.Go see The Mummy again instead. 1/10.",Van Helsing
366,Ithorianjedimaster2,Stephen Summers' career is still rolling in werewolf poop.,4,24 May 2007,"When the first trailer of ""Van Helsing"" was released, a lot of people got excited. Seeing Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman on the big screen once again as well as Hugh Jackman playing the fabled monster hunter Van Helsing, it looked as if the movie would have launched Stephen Summers' career. Well. . . maybe not so much.""The Mummy"" was another tribute to the classic monster movie and though it did very well in theaters and DVD, it still wasn't the best movie out there. ""The Mummy Returns"" received less praise than its predeccor, and finally, ""The Scorpion King"" was just a shot-in-the-dirt, an odd prequel that only confused viewers, instead of giving them an insight on the past of the villain from ""The Mummy Returns"". Finally, it boils down to ""Van Helsing"", a tribute to three of horror's greatest creatures.Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is in a predicament. All of Europe wants him dead, thinking he's a murderer. That's due to when all the monsters he kills turn back to their human forms and leaves him 'red-handed' in the point-of-views of the authorities. Well, after a job involving the capture of Mr. Hyde, Van Helsing comes back empty-handed, having killed Mr. Hyde (even though he changed back to Jekyll at the last minute and made Van Helsing's reputation as a murderer stronger), and within minutes, he is shoved into another mission to Transylvania to aid in the destruction of the notorious Count Dracula, who has been terrorizing the people there for centuries and Van Helsing must help Princess Ana in the hunt for Dracula, but it won't be easy. Dracula is on the search for Frankenstein's Monster, having killed the doctor (a mistake he regrets). After the monster disappeared, he and his 3 brides, along with Igor (who betrayed Dr. Frankenstein), are searching from the monster's whereabouts. Dracula also has a leash on the Wolf Man, which he uses to try and kill Princess Ana.It's an interesting concept. All the monsters mix into the story well, as do Van Helsing who is practically in his environment. Yet the story lacks character development, and most of the little character development goes towards Van Helsing and his forgotten past (even though he never finds out about his past and the ending just leaves you hanging). Princess Ana is basically the female love interest for Van Helsing and she doesn't do that much fighting, despite her attempts to. Carl (David Wenham) is the comic relief, using the ""Actually, I'm not a monk. I'm a friar"" excuse to get away with swearing and to get a girl into bed. Princess Ana and Carl, along with the other characters in the movie, save Van Helsing, are all suffering from little development, so you don't become connected to the characters and the movie becomes . . . just a movie, not the action-packed careers-improving film that Stephen Summers hoped for.In terms of music and CGI, fantastic. The technology in ""Van Helsing"" however is kind of out-of-date. It's the 1800s and Van Helsing is sporting an automatic crossbow that shoots metal bolts, as well as two hand-held buzz saws that also seem a little out-of-place in the world ""Van Helsing"" takes place in. There are also times where things are just awkward, such as when Van Helsing is protecting Ana from the three brides of Dracula, he can't seem to hit them with his crossbow on ""automatic"", but he hits his target when he switches to ""single fire"" and he seems to do it with relative ease. Then, there is the matter of the werewolf transformation to and from a human form. The Wolf Man literally rips off his own skin, exposing the alter ego underneath, but in a showdown against werewolf Van Helsing and Dracula, Van Helsing doesn't go through his phase one time and instead, just makes a quick transformation that is a bit out of the concept.The acting is well done, but it is clear that Kate Beckinsale is struggling to get her career back on the right foot. After ""Pearl Harbor"", she went into whatever movies looked like they would please the audience, therefore get big bucks in the process. That hasn't been doing so well. She either starred in pure flobs, ""Underworld"" and ""Underworld: Evolution"", or movies that just didn't make it to the top 5 in Box Office, ""Click"" and ""Vacancy"". Her role in this movie stands out because she is the only actress that looks as though she isn't fully into character and is just going by whatever script in going through her head. She also has the fakest crying I have ever seen. Plus, Kate just can't seem to have her expression change much, a problem faced in the two ""Underworld"" movies, and even when a werewolf is stalking her, she acts calm and emotionless, because everyone knows there is nothing frightening about being hunted by a 7-foot-tall Wolf Man. Hugh Jackman, as well as the other actors and actresses, are all perfect in their roles, even though those roles still fall a bit short in spots.""Van Helsing"" was tailed by ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"", then ""Hellboy"" and after the downpour of other box office movies that came after it, it was quickly left in the dirt and just couldn't seem to get Stephen Summers' career out of the werewolf poop. Try again, Stephen.",Van Helsing

368,lochnessmummy,A film about cliches (so don't expect much else),5,17 May 2004,"This movie is only slightly better than that unwatchable mess, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.  They're both quite comparable with each other.While Van Helsing is visually impressive, and mostly fun, it's too stupid to recommend to anyone.--If vampires could have babies like the rest of us, why would they all explode when their father dies?  (an obvious plot cop-out)--Who is Gabriel Van Helsing?  What is the history behind him?  They tried to tell us but then forgot about it.--If Frankenstein's monster is such a badass, why is he always getting trapped or running away?  I wanted to see him smash Dracula into little bloody meatballs.The best feature of the film, and there's plenty of it, is Kate Beckinsdale's curves.  She makes one of the best entrances I've ever seen, and eventually the pandering, topless-looking blouse she runs around in seems less crude and more like the cherries that top this banquet of fattening dessert.Directed by Steven Sommers, Van Helsing also recalls his blockbuster Mummy movies (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns).  Both of those films were great --and here's the proof.  All of these features are about style over substance; about being fun rather than thought-provoking.  But where Van Helsing is willing to lessen the depth of its script to the point where its entertainment value is barely skin deep --just so it can accommodate for more villains, The Mummy films were centered around only one villain, forcing them to write a script with deeper characters and better lines.",Van Helsing
369,janne_w,I go to movies to enjoy them... and I did enjoy Van Helsing!,10,7 May 2004,"I was prepared not to like this movie because of the hype. I'm married to a Vampire Move Lover. I like them too, but really like romance, if there is also something else going on. We both enjoyed this movie! Not only was the movie beautifully made as far as effects, but the people in the movie were also beautiful in their own right. I can't imagine anyone leaving in the middle of this movie, because if they did, they obviously did the movie a great disservice. The best of it was in the middle and toward the end. Of course, to each his own. If anyone is to give a summary of a movie, it stands to reason that they would at least give it a complete summary. Anything less is rather absurd, and gives the summary a condescending feeling... at least to me. My thoughts: Roxburgh was the most beguiling Dracula I have ever seen, from the way he pronounced his name to the way he obviously felt fear and pain when confronted with Van Helsing in the final moments. That was a surprise. Yes, I found it scary, but not in a terrifying way... in a ""this is a semi-serious horror movie with special effects and lots of little surprises"" way.Okay... my 12 year old daughter wasn't scared by the movie, but thrilled is a better word. She jumped, shrieked, and even laughed. Is that so bad? No, it's not the Exorcist of the Vampire world... it's a well done story of the timeless legends of Vampires and their brethren... in a fantasy world that I found captivating, and fun. There wasn't an overabundance of blood, though I found the scene in the vampire ""nursery"" a big icky... The little bit of romance there was tended to be more a thought than an action... and was a nice side trip to the fast paced action elsewhere.Overall - I loved it and really do believe it earned all 10 of the stars I gave it. I want to see it again already, and I just got home from the theater a little while ago.",Van Helsing
370,mullaryn,The mad adrenaline and non-stop action makes up for the at best weak plot.,7,3 May 2009,"I'm not certain why so many people hated this movie. I think it's because they expected something fantastic, Oscar-material, CGI laden action with deep philosophical ruminations, etc...No. Van Helsing isn't like that. The plot is at it's very best weak, there are obvious stupidities, and the acting, while not at all bad, is really unremarkable. But Van Helsing makes up for it by having boundless energy. The movie doesn't stop for one moment, piling acting upon action upon action sequences. All of that stuff about automatic crossbows, miniature bombs, and life-experiments... that's all bull. Of course it is. But it looks extremely good on screen, so just accept it and enjoy the fast-paced action.The acting... well, varied. Princess Anna was quite unconvincing to me. Too much pathos and drama, not enough regality (although again, that's just my opinion). Van Helsing, Carl, and Velkan were all on the level, convincing, and sometimes even very good (I particularly like that little line after Van Helsing shoots quite a few baby vampires. 'Now that I have your attention'.) Count Dracula was quite brilliant, and I believe that is the best role of vampire/scientist gone mad I have seen. His evil is believable, and his manner of speech is perfect for the role: a bit drawling, aloof, mocking. Best of all, he actually LOOKS the part. He is quite tall, equine, and there is the mark of those graced with aristocratic disregard for human life.Should you watch Van Helsing? Sure. But not if you need a quiet night in. Gather around with some friends, watch it on a big screen with good surround sound.7/10",Van Helsing
371,editor-92,Very dark and comical,7,7 May 2004,"I noticed that a lot of people don't like this film because of all of the special effects. Although I agree that they should stop making Hyde as a CGI creature (he was equally naff in LXG) I don't mind the effects. In fact, I didn't mind the film.Anyone going to this film and expecting anything other than complete mind candy should be slapped repeatedly. If you don't want to switch off your brain and enjoy some dark - but cool images - then find another film. Remember this comes to you from the guy who did the Mummy. He's obviously a classic film buff, because he doesn't come up with an original idea. Which I think is OK. Indiana Jones comes straight out of classic Hollywood and no one beats up Lucas and Spielberg over that. Not that I'm comparing this film to Raiders of the Lost Ark. It's nowhere in that league.
My biggest complaint about this film is that it makes the villain too attractive. I like Hugh Jackman, but Richard Roxburgh makes Dracula so enticing that I was hoping he and his awesome flying brides would triumph. The casting of this show seems to be a bit of an in joke. Kate Beckinsale's last film, Underworld, had her as a vampire fighting werewolves and that's kind of important to this film.Hugh Jackman has played Wolverine, a man in search of his ""lost past"" and here he does a similar turn. (There's another similarity that I won't spoil.)The best in this film, though, is David Wexham, who played Faromir in LOTR. He's almost unrecognizable as the friar sidekick and he gets the best lines. (I noticed that I was often the only one laughing, though.)If you're hung up on finding a ""great film,"" just realize that Hollywood is making them anymore. Van Helsing, is however, a fun and visually stunning substitute.",Van Helsing

Personally i was bored to death. The worst film i've seen at the cinema since queen of the damned. Now i'm a lover of special effects but not when they are grossley overused to overcompensate for a complete lack of story. I really am struggling to believe what i have just witnessed - the scenery, the effects, the costumes - must have took so long and cost so much. Instead of being impressed it just makes me think, ""what a dreadful waste!"" Not even hot vampire chicks could save this stinker!The acting was bad, it wasn't scary or funny, the characters i didn't even remotely care for - infact i didn't care about anything i saw on the screen throughout.And its the little things that really annoy me. I like some realism in fantasy - the vampires in this movie morph into nudity and then morph back into clothes. Clothes aren't living flesh, clothes don't change into vampires and back!What an utter rubbish film! You know the only people i can imagine liking this film are very young boys who love computer games because the whole film is like watching a computer game - non stop monsters and action.

The scariest thing throughout was THE DIALOGUE, it sounded as if Sommer's 12 yr old nephew wrote most of it. The acting was expectedly bad but Dracula was so over the top, that I found myself fast forwarding through his parts (yes I rented, no way in hell was I going to pay nine dollars to see this). The plot was completely predictable as most of Sommers films are, the special effects were outlandish - part of the reason of a no scare factor is that almost all the monsters were cgi'd in, looking more like cartoons, than anything else. The old horror films Sommers is trying to pay homage to had waaaayyyy more class this his modern day crapnanza. Save yourself the pain of this film, its not a good horror flick, its a lousy action flick, there's no real comedy, and drama...well you'd get more drama from watching cspan than this thing...surprisingly the DVD does make a good frisbee.",Van Helsing

Another is Richard Rox he has talent bursting out of his ears, he could be the best, though crap will garrante him not to reach that.The one thing which stopped me from walking out was the 'score', fantastic music.

375,evan-pahl,Great Universal Monster Flick,9,22 October 2020,"I absolutely love this movie. Universal did a fantastic job at creating a movie that pays homage to the classic movie monsters of old for the modern day, and solidifies itself as a classic Halloween-time favorite.
The plot and story are evenly paced. Its an entertaining action movie with a healthy balance of its comic relief and lore/world building. Sets are incredibly crafted and built, stunts for the most part mostly complimented by practical effects, which in my opinion make a film better; even is CGI isn't terribly cumbersome. Sure it has a certain campiness that adds to its charm, and fortunately it doesn't take away from it.

I don't only want my money back, I wish I could get compensation for having two hours of my life spent in torture.  Dracula and Frankenstien and his monster and Igor and Dracula's servants and his brides and.... JEEZ.  Every character was hallow, two dimensional and annoying.  I loved the Mummy, but this is not even in the same world as that film.  That being said, this movie has PLENTY to offer CHILDREN, and those 13 and under may very well enjoy this film.

And the actor playing Carl reminded me of Danny Kaye and was the glue that held the picture together. In fact I would say he stole the show.If you like good wholesome monsterous adventure, then I recommend the movie So I am very surprised that most of the voters (with whom I agree 90% of the time) have rated this movie so low.

378,jiujitsu_jesus,Hokum without a smile,6,21 December 2004,"VAN HELSING is Stephen Sommers' latest tribute to the horror-action classics of the early age of film. His last two attempts, THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS were resounding successes, each with a talented, dynamic cast, rip-roaring action scenes, giddy humour and innovative special effects. But the quality that these two films possessed that resulted in their popularity was the fact that they did not take themselves too seriously. The entire atmosphere was one of light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek satire; every scene had a funny line, every character had their moments. The entire plot and backstory were a load of garbage, but Sommers made no attempt to defend this- rather, he exploited it, concocting each film as a skilful mix of horror, action and comedy.VAN HELSING keeps the unconvincing horror and the schlocky action, but dispenses with the comedy, meaning that the film is presented in a mood of self-mocking severity, which is inadvisable given its B-grade content. I won't insult your intelligence by going through the insipid storyline. Let it suffice to say that Gabriel Van Helsing is an enigmatic nineteenth-century monster hunter working for the special operations branch of the Catholic Church (!!). In his travels, he does battle against an agglomeration of monsters from the horror films of the early twentieth century, such as Frankenstein's Monster (Shuler Hensley), Mr. Hyde (Robbie Coltrane), the Wolf Man (Will Kemp), and, of course, the notorious Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), deformed by the stupid plot as a shallow, James-Bond-style ""criminal mastermind"".He is joined on his quest by the luscious Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale), who has little to do other than look good, given her brainless dialogue, and her battles against Dracula's harem, which are little more than softcore lesbian catfights. Probably the biggest wet blanket in the cast is the uncharacteristically wooden Hugh Jackman in the lead role, whose woeful acting is an exemplar of the film's new, shamefully schlocky mood.The ""horror"" in the film consists entirely of gaudy computer-generated effects, all of which are about as frightening as Barney the Dinosaur in a clown mask. The ""action"" consists of Jackman and Beckinsale shooting up computer-generated monsters with implausibly anachronistic weapons, supplied by Carl (David Wenham), the Catholic Church's chief armourer (!!!).It's unfortunate that I had to dwell on the film's flaws for much of this review, because there are a few merits. Even if it's not scary, it still looks awesome, particularly the Balkan wilderness vistas, which rival those in the Lord of the Rings. The music is masterfully composed and very atmospheric. The art direction, while, again, failing to frighten, is still skilful and beautiful to look at. Unlike the rest of the cast, David Wenham shines, possibly the only one not to take his role too seriously, a sole vestige of Stephen Sommers' better days in THE MUMMY.It looks great, it sounds good - 2/3 ain't bad. But if it's chills and thrills - or even plot and acting - that you want, you're looking in the wrong place. 6/10, purely for presentation. This film has no substance.",Van Helsing
379,Darkfrog24,My eyes! My eyes!,1,9 November 2005,"I'll save you the trouble of watching this movie in two words: DORKULA LIVES!This is one of the worst things I've seen, EVER. It knocked John Carpenter's Vampires out of the #1 spot on my list of Worst Vampire Movies I've Ever Seen ...and I watched Dracula 3000! This movie has a good cast. I am amazed that there is so little good acting. It's been a long time since anything I saw in a film had me wanting to claw out my eyes. Half the reason I didn't was that doing so would require me to stop covering my ears. The dialogue was dreadful, but not nearly so dreadful as the cringingly stereotypical fake accents sported by half the cast.Kate Beckinsale's character is supposed to be a gypsy, but neither she nor her brother not her entourage dress, act or seem to think like Roma. The word is just tossed in there. It would have been much better, I think, to refer to them as Romanian nobles and leave it at that. It doesn't help that she looks like she's dressed up as a pirate for Halloween.Most of this movie had me wondering just how stupid the writers think their viewers are, but the ending topped it all. Since there are probably people out there who would enjoy this movie -- though I have little idea why -- I won't give details on it, but let's just say I was worried that the Care Bears were going to show up.Redeeming points: Frankenstein is done fairly well, as are the patterns of movement on the vampires as they fly. This movie has the best werewolf visuals I've ever seen. There are also hints of a good story going on in the background with the mystery of Van Helsing's unknown past, but instead of playing these up as a real subplot, this movie buries them under piles and piles of some of the stupidest writing I've ever seen.",Van Helsing

Fight scenes lacked choreography.  Lots of plot holes. For example, the monsters somehow get to keep their underwear while the rest of their clothes melt into their skin during transformation.  The characters were inconsistent in their abilities.  In one scene a character can leap tall buildings in a single bound, and another scene later the same character can't hardly climb a ledge.This movie was rated PG-13, however it was basically a rated G movie with a script fit for saturday morning cartoons and a few scenes of violence to get the rating up to a PG-13.",Van Helsing

383,dan_marsala,"really funny, exiting, scary and special film, with mean producers",8,1 March 2008,"this film at the first sight as nothing special, but it is really kind of weird. the story lines is attractive and appropriate for the Count Dracula's fans. Is a truly awesome way to make an action-funny movie about such a legendary and told fight between Van Helsing and Dracula, and of course, the bound of the Frankenstein monster and the Wolfman to the story is a great contribution to the action, even if its not the best of the ideas, nor the most original idea, either. Thats for the Castlevania players, in which both of them, frank and wolf, make apparitions in various parts of the game. By the way, I was waiting for a mention about the Helsing-Belmont's clan relation, too. The most of the people that watched the movie with me didn't know about the long story between this two characters. And maybe thats why I fall in love with the big fight. I was waiting a lot of talking between them, and cross traps, and holly water spurts, like the Bram Stocker version (that is a great movie, too), but I had a truly good outcome, instead. Its a shame that the makers couldn't get more funds for best special effects, best costumes, best weapons and all that stuff. A project like that, must be very well done. But, otherwise, they got material for the next one, they got the mummy, the phantom of the opera, the hollow man,etc. they got the chance to make another good movie, and thats why I say YES TO VAN HELSING 2!!!!",Van Helsing
384,UltramarineX,A disappointment...,6,10 July 2004,"**Spoilers ahead**I really wanted to like this movie, I really did.  I watched the trailers and TV commercials thinking how cool this movie looks.  Unfortunately Van Helsing is marred by some glaring flaws that keep me from recommending it. 
This is not to say the movie is all bad.  The most obvious high points are the fight scenes.  My attention was definitely grabbed when Van Helsing started wailing on some vampires with his automated crossbow.  Also Hugh Jackman is pretty good (although not great) in this movie with his somewhat comedic dialogue.  Kate Beckinsale is also smokin hot in this movie, although you wonder about the practicality of fighting in high heels. 
My main beef with Van Helsing is with the monsters.  Particularly with Frankenstein, Dracula, and Dracula's wives.  The acting and dialogue spouted by these characters is bad.  I mean REALLY bad.  I cringe whenever they start talking, not because it's scary, but I'm afraid they might not stop yapping.  The CGI for some of the monsters, such as the Mr. Hyde monster, at times looks obviously fake.  Yeah I know they're fake to begin with, but I think an actor with some good monster make up would have been a better choice instead of computers.  Lastly, this movie relies too much on special effects instead of character development.  In a movie like Van Helsing you expect a lot of special effects to be used, but other movies (like the Spider-Man and X-Men movies) have shown that you can have great effects and great character development as well.I would like to leave off by saying that Van Helsing was not a totally bad movie, but it does nothing to propel itself above just being an average one. However, if Van Helsing 2 ever comes out, I am willing to give it a chance, in the hopes they have corrected a least some of the mistakes from the first movie.  I give Van Helsing a 6/10.",Van Helsing
385,reddragon1110,"Dark, very dark.",6,11 May 2004,"Van Helsing was one of the biggest blockbusters in the 2004. A very dark film, featuring vampires werewolves, monsters and other creatures from the European literature and mythology. I was disapointed by this film. The settings looked completly aritfitial, the monsters looked totally fake, the make up and the cinematography  where very good, Hugh's performance sucked and this is actually evidenced of his lack of talent. Kate was better, but still her performance was very bad. But the main flaw of this film is the bloody script.  Dracula is probably one of the riches myths, and novels from Europe, filled with symbolism, and mainly is about an ""anti-Christ"" that is immortal, and that he lives drinking blood. Filled with dark and religious symbolism is one of the best myths ever. Frankesnstain is contrast it a story, (By Mary Shelly) about playing god, about turning dead to live, about resurection (artifitial). Together those three stories make a lame , stupid film, with great visual effects, but stupid.",Van Helsing
386,Lag2Deth,Anything Goes Means Nothing Works,3,21 July 2004,"The plot is incoherent. The special effects/action scenes crowd out any possibility of real acting, yet are strangely and distractingly sub-par. To call the characters ""cardboard cutouts"" would be offensive to cardboard.I don't usually say this about movies, because I appreciate that writing is not easy. But in this case, I'll say it: Even I could have written a better script. The mirror universe of the movie has no internal logic - virtually anything appears to be possible at any time - so there can be no dramatic tension. Plot points are revealed through awkward explanatory speeches, rather than by showing the audience how things are. That would be a serious weakness in any sort of script, but it's a huge mistake in an action movie, of all things. Without the slightest whiff of drama and without any audience involvement with the sketchy characters, the action that makes up the bulk of the movie is merely sound and fury, signifying nothing.Not silly enough to be fun in the MST3000 sense, it was merely dull. As if to make up for the dullness, it's also long. I kept checking my watch, something I don't recall doing in the movies recently. I paid US$0.50 to see this movie, and I think it was about US$8 too much. Some have called this movie ""homage"" to monster movies of old. If this is what the golden-oldie monster movies were like, I'd say they're best forgotten.",Van Helsing
387,sheepie87,Fifty-fifty,5,22 July 2006,"Hum. I don't know what exactly I think of this film. I have two opposing opinions, exactly, but they coexist well enough for me to give Van Helsing five out of ten. So here's my split- personality opinion: The Pros: Well, number one is Hugh Jackman. He's very into the character--you can tell he believes in it, and that makes Van Helsing believable, even if he seems a little out-of-period. Whatever. I don't care. Also number one for ... aesthetic reasons. In addition, the actual ""monsters"" are very close to their originals. Finally! A Dracula who has all the seductive power of Bram Stoker's original; a Monster who converses intelligently (instead of pained Irnghs) and seems very soulful-also close to Mary Shelley's original. Hyde, well, whatever. I didn't like the book anyway. The Cons: Believability for the HUMANS. I stress humans. Supernatural monsters can do whatever they want, because they don't adhere to our rules. So if Frankenstein's monster wants to wrestle a flying bat-bride of Drakula, fine by me. But, please. Anna falls down, hits every branch in a huge tree, lands on her back, and isn't hurt? Must be the corset and those dominatrix boots ... Actually, I realize most of the problems in this film stem from Anna. If she weren't there, and they swapped her with her brother ... that would have been much better. Also: the ending. Lord. Can you think of anything sappier than dead people's faces floating around in the sky, smiling down on Van Helsing??? I think this is what they should have done: Obviously, the Creature has the ability to give life. Moved by his experience with these people who see beyond his inherent ugliness, he decides to submit to the pain one more time to give life to the one who died. This would thus cut the horrid sun-smiling scene. Urgh. But of course, that's my opinion--and I'm not paid millions of dollars to write and direct movies. But whatever.",Van Helsing
388,requiem1896,Great Concept + bad execution = disappointing film,4,9 May 2004,"Van Helsing is another example of one of those plot concepts that simply fell apart because too much budget and time was spent on the effects. Some things worth noting:  The opening sequence has some of the most stunning black  whitecinematography since Schindler's list.   Throughout the whole film the Art Direction/Set Design was done excellently. Costume and Design was also done well.  In short, the film was aestheticallypleasing.  [Incidentally, depending on the quality of this year's film on average, Van Helsing could find a nomination for Art Direction]  Acting:  Kate Beckinsale fakes a great Romanian accent.  The character of her brother is well acted and one of the few highlights in this film.    Worthy of particular praise are Samuel West and Shuler Hensley.  Their portrayal of Dr. Frankenstein and his monster, respectively, are so accurate to earlier portrayals of the characters it is practically chilling.David Wenham:  Nice job on his part.  Nothing award-winning but he designedand acted his character well.  Most of the funniest moments are due to hisdelivery of lines and mannerism.Key Problems: Plot: Too much is left unexplained.  Particularly, Van Helsing's relationship toDracula.  Attempts a mythological explanation for the Van Helsing character fail due to the lack of good plot exposition.  Simply put, by the end of the film you get the feeling that three or four scenes, which are necessary for the plot, were cut from the film.   What was intended to be interesting, almost mystical, simply fails to beanything but confusing.  Even with a good understanding of Christianmythology, the film leaves blatant holes unfilled. [on a side note: what was with the reference to the Bavarian Illuminati? Talk about dropping symbols for nothing and not tying it to any plot point.] Like  The Mummy and its sequel, the film had several one-liners and comedicmoments but many of them were flat, obvious, &/or simply not funny.Acting: Kate Beckinsale did good work with the accent but the character is so much more than that.  Moments of power and moments of weakness oscillate with thecharacter.  What starts as a smart and strategic character makes blatantly stupid decisions followed by being smart and tactical.  Multiple personalities? Maybe. Her fault or the writers? Probably both.Hugh Jackman was acceptable but, unlike in other roles of his, he seemed tojust walk through the lines.  Comedy of this sort, like in the Mummy & its sequel, requires a great deal of effort on the part of the cast and it just didn't seem like that effort was there.
In summation:  Save your money ! ! !   This film is worth renting, mainly for the one-liners.  Diehard monster-movie buffs will want to watch this for theFrankenstein-opening and a few other scenes.",Van Helsing

But, hell, I loved it anyway!",8,5 January 2005,"Yeah, I know this isn't a masterpiece of cinema and I can already tell half this nation's populace hates it despite a good run at the box office last summer. But still I went into this movie just looking for a good time (that and am a huge fan of old school monster films) and thats what I got. For the uptight and so called expert critics, let me spell it out for you: ITS A POPCORN MOVIE! OF COURSE EVERYTHING GOING TO BLOWN UP TO THE MAX AND GO OVER THE TOP! IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS, THEN DON'T CLAIM YOU DO AND BASH A FILM BECAUSE OF IT! *Ahem* alright on to my review.Plot: Helsing and his assistant, a frair named Carl, are sent to Translvaynia to protect the last of a gypsy family from being stuck in purgatory due to a curse Dracula put on them. In the process however Helsing must also stop Drac's plan of engulfing the world in darkness all the while battling his minions. Throw in a plot device involving Frankenstein's monster and you have a pretty cool adventure brewing.I'll admit for a movie that suppose to be about Helsing. They kinda dropped the ball on the story. There's way too much emphasis on the gypsy girl rather him and they don't flesh out his back story about his lost memory and his supposed history with Dracula. Also the movie has a few nonsense parts (the talk with the creepy undertaker) which kinda slows down the film a bit. But still the movie stays on a linear path and the set-ups up to confrontations are well done. Not to mention the confrontation themselves even if some are a little silly (ballroom scene (though a good homage to the Fearless Vampire Killers), the fight with the last bride, Igor and Dracula himself). Yes their CGI laden but I don't care, its a supernatural movie after all. So what better way to do them.The actors seem very comfortable with their roles and looks to be having a great time. Extra props go out to the dude who played Frankenstien's monster, I was really feeling for him. Easily one of the best characters in the movie.Add to that some excellent backdrops and clothes to which the film really draws you into its 19th century world. Yes the movie is full of flaws but it only for fun and only wants to entertain to which it success in spades. If you don't like it, well fine. But for all who love a good popcorn flick or a fan of old school monsters, you can look no further. Van Helsing is just the ticket for a simple good time.",Van Helsing
390,alexis_240,Nothing like a tribute to the good old days,9,18 December 2007,"An incredible amount of special effects, a silly and implausible plot and far too advanced for the time weapons, could I be talking about anything other than a Stephen Sommers' film? Probably not.From the very beginning, with Victor Frankenstein yelling 'It's alive' taking us back to 1931 and to a young Colin Clive, Van Helsing is a tribute to the legendary Universal monster movies. Everybody's here: Frankenstein, the wolf man, the character of which despite its totally different look still reminds us of the renowned Lon Chaney Jr, Count Dracula in a very anti-Lugosi (or Chris Lee for that matter) look which if my memory doesn't fail me includes an ear ring! Finally there's the famous hunchback called Ygor (surely one of Lugosi's finest performances e.g. Son of Frankenstein, 1939) Unfortunately this homage to horror classics will go by unnoticed by anybody too young or too ignorant to be familiar with monster movies, and he/she will therefore perceive this movie as another mindless action adventure. This is partly true in terms of the plot: Dracula's women giving birth to dead babies and him trying to bring them back to life using Frankenstein-like techniques. Parallel to this is the werewolf legend and the search for a lycanthropy cure. Both the plot and collection of monsters serve as an homage to movies like Frankenstein meets the wolf man (1943), House of Frankenstein (1944), and House of Dracula (1945). The count appears in the two houses, whereas the wolf man (Larry Talbot) is in all three seeking a cure or an effective way to kill himself.This movie transforms Bram Stoker's Van Helsing into a monster hunter or exterminator whose assignment just happens to be Dracula and who suffers from nightmares that apparently are repressed memories of his previous existence. Anyway plot-wise it's no Pulitzer prize winner, I grant you that, but don't miss the point, It's a tribute to an era long gone. After viewing many Universal classic horror originals and sequels I couldn't help but like the film. Probably the greatest way to enjoy it is by first watching the original Dracula, Frankestein and Wolfman movies which will enable you to put the film into perspective or in an appropriate context within which to judge it. To conclude Van Helsing is not (at least in my opinion) your mainstream action adventure, it's a well made fantasy ride that owes its plot and characters to a number of extremely influential horror classics.",Van Helsing

The location photography is great. The integration of real and CGI shots is always convincing. The acting never falls below good, and sometimes is excellent.Most importantly, since it's promoted as an action film, it's stuffed full of action. At the same time, there are scenes that reflect the spirit of the ideas of the original books it portrays.

Wait a minute, did I say great story and script? I meant to say that it looked like somebody blocked the computer generated action sequences from the up coming `King Kong verses the Pirates of the Caribbean', and Van Helsing stole them, inserting various and sundry soft core monsters where there should be buccaneers and a big ape.By and large this movie was just stupid. It wasn't very funny where it tried to be, it's continuity was terrible and if you love classic monsters you'll despise this. No longer are vampires part of God's great vengeance, it's all a personal feud between Romanian inbreds. Victor Frankenstein is no longer obsessed with the very nature of life, he's laboring to create a power up for the vampire boss, who has a Bond worthy plot to fill the world with demonic telletubbies, part green gummi bear, part Alien egg sack.You'll also learn that you can run from Budapest to Transylvania and just barely be out of breath, which is good to know if a flavorless well groomed vampire is about to use an automaton as some sort of cable box to correctly charge his spawn.I actually fell asleep for a couple of minutes.If I was 14 and had never seen anything else in the way of horror or action movies, maybe it could get a pass, as it is I give it a 5/10, and that's with a bonus for a great angry mob.",Van Helsing

The Friar was very good as comedy relief, Dracula's brides were alternately luscious and vicious, Frankenstein's monster was very well done, even with the steampunk edge to him.  This was more the monster from the book than from the old Universal films, but, for me, it worked.Dracula was a bit insipid and the CGI'd Mr. Hyde was almost cartoonish.  As another reviewer pointed out, there were no scary moments, but this was, to me, much more of a CGI action picture, with a horror motif, than a horror movie.

Director Stephen Sommers did so well with ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", but somehow lost his way when it came to ""Van Helsing"". What was wrong with it? Besides almost shattering Hugh Jackman's acting career and adding to the humiliation of Kate Beckinsale's acting career? Nothing really. However, lots of really good special effects, a drool-worthy cast and a poorly developed script, don't sell at the box office, that is where films like ""Troy"" are catergorised.The cast was well hand picked, Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing, he is a man of many talents but I wasn't entirely sure if he made a good decision signing on for this picture, Kate Beckinsale is beautiful as Anna, but I'll admit that her Romanian accent in the film was almost laughable if you know what I mean. Richard Roxburgh as the one and only Count Dracula, excellent pick and I'll agree most of the girls in the cinema went home smiling after they heard his sexy Romanian accent, David Wenham as Carl, he made the audience laugh out loud and in every good action picture you need a comic relief and Wenham made us laugh. So the cast was delicious. But that didn't seem to work for the viewing public.I'll be honest with you I only watched it because of Hugh Jackman. I think most female viewers watched it because of Jackman and the male viewers watched it because of Kate Beckinsale.It also flopped because of the overload of special effects, as a digital animation student we need to earn a living so you can't blame us there. However action packed special effects movies don't sell well, that is where ""Chronicles of Riddick"" went down hill.Now the script is where the biggest blunder is. I shall quote from the film: ""...Because the only thing that can kill him is a werewolf..."". Okay anyone who has an extensive knowledge of vampires should correct them if they are wrong. Where were the writers who wrote the scripts for 'The Mummy' and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" I ask you? The answer is unknown. I recently bought the Van Helsing DVD and was taken in with all the special features, since I have studied film and animation I am all for 'Behind The Scenes' and I developed empathy for the cast and crew, as a director you never believe that your film is going to crash and burn. Also it is good that you have a good time making the film and judging by what I watched on the featurettes, they seemed happy.Mr Sommers, don't take it personally, just learn from your mistakes and if you're going to make a sequel to Van Helsing, please try harder!Thank you for your attention.",Van Helsing
399,jasonklingensmith,Suspend your disbelief!,4,30 April 2005,"The only good things about this movie were the atmosphere, the special effects, and the woman that played Van Helsing's love interest.I was very disappointed at several things this movie offered. While, I liked the way they incorporated more than just Dracula, the fact that the Werewolf was the only thing that could kill him, I didn't like. I also didn't like the way they used religion in the movie to describe Dracula and Van Helsing's roots.The way the lighting changed rapidly, and after the sunlight was out, the Vampires were still attacking, was stupid. The character chosen to play Dracula was terrible, and he didn't do a very good job acting, either. I expect him to be at least somewhat intimidating. While I was in awe of some of the special effects, they really did hurt this movie. You already have to suspend your sense of disbelief for any monster movie or Dracula story, but you don't expect the normal characters to be more than human. Van Helsing's background was explained and therefore he can be the exception. But the woman, give me a break. She falls from trees, gets thrown out of windows, swings from wires hundreds of feet in the air, dangles from cliffs, yet somehow she manages to always land on her feet; not just on her feet, but on her feet without a scratch. It's very hard to take the movie seriously while this is going on. And then, after surviving all that, a werewolf landing on her, kills her. If she can survive all the other stuff, the werewolf wouldn't have killed her. The acting, aside from Dracula, was not really that bad. And the storyline wasn't terrible either, but in order to enjoy this movie, you have to suspend your disbelief of everything you've ever known or read, not just about monsters, but humanity as well. This could have been a great movie, but ended up being a waste of 2 hours.",Van Helsing
400,esc_oblivion,Give me a break; this movie ROCKED!,10,8 May 2004,"Okay, I don't know where those who are critical of this movie come off... I just got back from seeing it, and am happy to report that the movie was awesome. All of the negative comments I'd read before seeing it were disproved as far as I'm concerned. The score was great, the sound engineering fabulous, and overall the sound was no louder than any other action movie (Matrix anyone?). The CG was absolutely incredible. I went in knowing (from an interview with Stephen Sommers) that Frankenstein was entirely CG ALL the time, and was blown away to find that he looked and acted more real than a REAL Frankenstein (i.e. guy in a body suit) would look. I personally liked the lines that others are complaining about. They were comfortable, humorous, timely, well-delivered, and often sarcastic in just the right measure. This is one film that will be looked back on highly, but that some like to bash simply because it has all their favorite classic creatures in it but in a different context then some viewers like. It also is an unapologetically fun, playful film, and I appreciated the thrill ride it delivered. I also was not annoyed by the use of FX.
All in all, I think it's far and away the best Stephen Sommers film EVER. I pretty much hated Return of the Mummy II - mostly because of the horrendous ""scorpion king"" CG at the end. But for the most part both Mummies were fun, but nearly as fun as Van Helsing. So, lighten up guys. Don't be so arrogant as to think you're above this kind of fun film. You can't honestly tell me that you think the dialogue, story, and even CG were nearly as bad as they were in the Matrix trilogy. Granted, the Matrix trilogy got away with a passable story, and horrendous dialogue only because of its marvelous CG... *sigh* I'm done ranting.

401,lodewijkpollemans,Worst 'monster'-movie ever,1,17 November 2006,"I'm not gonna explain the plot of this movie, because that would be a waste of space, trust me. Everything about this movie is wrong. Hollywood just scrambled some nice and famous actors, spent millions, and I mean MILLIONS of dollars on CGI, and 0,000 in story/plot line and/or logic. The logic in this movie is so bad, that I think only a 4-year old could see through these horrid flaws. I.e.: Hugh Jackman wears a ring throughout the movie, but when he transforms into a werewolf later-on, he doesn't wear it anymore. ""Could've come of by the transformation into a werewolf"" I hear you say, but here comes the funny part; When he talks to Dracula himself later on and changes back into his human form, Dracula makes a comment about the ring on Hugh's hand that supposedly belongs to him. Ermmm... What happened here?! Did he put the ring back on in a split-second or what?? Thats just bad movie-making! Also, if you want to make a movie about monster-movie classics, make sure you got your facts right. The monster of Frankenstein wasn't called Frankenstein, only the doctor was called like that.I have to admit that at least the idea behind the whole 'monster-classic'-ode of the movie sounds cool, but when it comes to it, this movie can't even get clóse to those classics.The CGI-effects are also so wááááy to much on the foreground, that it made me feel like I was watching somebody play a (bad) video game on his PC. The werewolves look like furries on steroids, and act like gorrila's. Isn't a werewolf suppose to act wolvish, or at least something like that anyway? Now they jump over buildings like a furry version of the incredible Hulk. The barks-sounds that they made also were not very convinsing (wolves don't bark). Same thing goes for the vampires: just as terrible.All in all; just rent some monster-classics and keep on dreaming of what this movie cóuld have been. This is a 'modern'-view of monsters that should not be.",Van Helsing

Over the past few years we've been treated to some very well-written, thoughtful popcorn movies during the summer movie season and this year promises some of wonderful potential. However, movies like ""Armageddon"", ""The Mummy Returns"" and ""Mission: Impossible 2"" have left me cold and looking for the exit sign.  I willingly admit that ""Van Helsing"" shares far more in common with these movies than it does the more intelligent summer films, but for some bizarre reason, I found myself smiling a lot during the film.  Yes, it's obnoxiously loud.  Yes, there are plot holes you could drive a semi through.  Yes, the acting ranged from O.K. to MST3K atrociousness.  But the sets are fantastic, the atmosphere inviting and...darn it all...the bad stuff was entertainingly bad.  In fact, it seemed intentional.  The thick-as-pine-sap accents were completely in keeping with the goofy tone that underlines the entire movie. The jokes are broad and the pace is brisk.  The deliberate stagey nature of the movie is obviously in homage to the old horror films that inspired it. It may not be as smart as they were, but it doesn't want to be.  This may be the best brainless summer film I've ever seen.  Most likely because it has no intention of even trying to be anything else.",Van Helsing
403,gatra,Average,6,8 May 2004,"SPOILER POSSIBILITY! SPOILER WARNING!This was such an average movie. The story was basically just about Van Helsing, a man that was feared in Europe, hunting Dracula. The maker of the movie just chucked in famous fictions such as Dracula himself, with a bit of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Not forgetting the mythical harpy ladies. This movie was quite boring actually...it started off quite exciting, with all the Frankenstein stuff, Van Helsing chasing Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, and it went on with a really really predictable story line. IT WAS BORING. They tried to put a bit comedy with the comical role of Carl (David Wenham, who was cool in Lord of the Rings), the Friar, who unfortunately wasn't funny, the comedy was pretty lame.The werewolves looked really fake (poor CGI). Trite storyline. There's nothing special about this movie. The only thing I like was probably the automatic crossbow, that was pretty cool stuff. The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was a more fun movie to watch than this one. Van Helsing is not worth watching at the movies.",Van Helsing
404,kevjohn,Maybe We Should Get Hugh Jackman to Track Down Bin Laden,4,7 May 2004,"What a waste. What a shame.Kate Beckinsale, please retire. Sorry, I just had to get that off my chest.The only thing worse than than a boring action movie, is sitting next to a group of restless teenagers watching a boring action movie. Sure, it's no one in particular's fault that the teens were expecting every minute of this film to be as action-packed as the Burly Brawl, but that is of little consequence to you while you witness them grumbling and fumbling with their illuminated cell phones in your peripheral vision. Fun times.The action this film does contain is...rudimentary and yet overdone at the same time. Each action scene goes on for what seems like ten minutes. This is not a big problem except that at about the 90-second mark all the action seemed to be repeating itself. At one point one of our heroes spits out a sentiment to a bad guy that I first heard more than two decades ago in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY and have heard repeated in a half dozen films since (including DIE HARD): ""If you are going to kill someone, kill them. Don't talk."" Agreed. Every bad guy in VAN HELSING should have learned that lesson years before this film took place. Instead we're treated with scene after scene of villains slowly stalking our heroes while delivering menacing monologues so lengthy they would have left Rush Limbaugh breathless.The plot is thin, even with everything the screenwriter tried to cram into it:  there's every movie monster of the 20th century except Hannibal Lecter and Godzilla, a romance that condenses out of nothingness, a centuries-old feud, the secret crime-fighting society (complete with hidden HQ and James Bond's Q-like inventors), Dracula's horde of winged babies, the no-nonsense hero with trusty comical sidekick, the beautiful heroine who always needs saving, a duplicitous gravedigger (""It's what I do""), a monster-with-a-heart-of-gold, a quartet of bumbling evil henchmen. If you watch carefully in the second half of the film you will see the kitchen sink.Hugh Jackman showed flashes of greatness in the X-men films. Here he is mostly flat. The aforementioned Beckinsale is atrocious. Between the horrible accent she affects and the historically inaccurate Madonna-esque pseudo-S&M corseted catsuit, she is about as believable in her role as Roseanne Barr would be (I thought women of that era were supposed to be chunkier anyway). The rest of the actors were decent enough spewing out their rote lines.Go see VAN HELSING. Or else you won't know what's going on in the sequel.",Van Helsing
405,Mizz-Helena,great adventure,10,29 May 2004,"I absolutely loved this movie, Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale is just wonderful. Now Hugh Jackman have turned to my ""one of the sexiest man i ever seen"" list. Last time i saw him was in x-men. I love Kate Beckinsale, she is one of my favorite actresses, and she was so cool in the movie, i loved her in ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Underworld"". She must keep playing in more movies too. And David Wenham was too funny in the movie, but it was to weird for me to understand that he played the brave, tall, warrior in Lord of the Rings to a little comic munk in Van Helsing. But he is a great actor, no doubt with that.This movie had an incredible storyline, without the vampires i think it would be better. But it was exiting to see wolfman again and also Frankenstein. Dracula wasn't that kind of scary, it was just an ordinary man who wanted to create his own family, by using Frankenstein's monster into an some-sort of cave. But the real Dracula looked real ugly. i rate this movie 10/10",Van Helsing
406,HighlanderArg,"High-budget ""Beowulf""",5,23 November 2004,"SPOILERS MARKED BELOW!The movie is not that bad in itself. We have an amnesic VAn Helsing (not Abraham, this one's called Gabriel) who goes after Dracula, to protect a gypsy girl from the Lord of the Night. We have fun, the scenery is slightly impressive, KAte Beckinsale is hoooooot, but... somewhat lacks originality.Right from the start, we have VH hunting Mr.Hyde in France. First ripoff here: ""The League of xtraordinary gentlemen"". Unfortunately, the writer of this also forgot to read Stevenson's book. Hyde is small and grunty, not a hulk. But of course, VH is also hunted, by the local police (I recall... ""The Punisher"").Back to his quarters (in the Vatican), he is sent after Dracula. Suddenly, he is faced by the Italian 1800-ish version of Q (James Bond's weapon provider). But the worst is... not only it took stuff from such films, ""Van Helsing"" also has a character who walks around crammed with weapons... like ""Beowulf"" (yes, the highly criticised Christopher Lambert's version). It's too similar a film to that one, except that there's no ""Mortal Kombat"" feeling, and the FX are way better.In short, something fun to waste a bit more than 2 hours of your life.5/10NOW COMES THE SPOILER!

And it doesn't take a genius to figure out what that purpose means to Stephen Sommers.This film comes off the success of his rendition of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, equally hammy in its vision and scope. It's too bad this film was a flop at the box office. I would've probably enjoyed a few more entries from Sommers.",Van Helsing
408,refrankfurt,Never too late to dig graves...,5,2 April 2007,"With the possible exception of the current occupant of the White House, few things have provoked more sharply divided opinions than this movie. People either slobber over it or throw up on it. The first time I ever tried to watch it (on some cable network or other) I turned it off in the middle of the big scene where the female vampires attack, stoutly averring that there was no way to get drunk enough to watch the rest of it without slipping into a coma. Since then, I have come round to the opinion that this movie really does sort of grow on you. (Yes, I know, so do skin tags, warts and carbuncles.) That's why I'm actually giving it five out of ten stars. Yes, that's right, I said five out of ten. Consider: 1. Who would have believed that Universal's long-delayed sequel to ""Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"" could have made the original film look like a polished work of art by comparison? 2. What other movie can you think of, in which the Frankenstein monster is actually the most sensitive, intelligent character? 3. Where else can you hear so many different people all trying to imitate Bela Lugosi, without any of them even coming close? 4. What other movie had its script written by 50 monkeys who were really trying to reproduce the complete text of Hamlet by accident? 5. Where else can you see a heroine get so relentlessly bashed, smashed and slammed around, walking away from all of it with no more ill effects than Wile E. Coyote, only to be killed in the end by a relatively minor collision with a CG werewolf? (Presumably all those massive internal injuries finally caught up with her.) 6. Well, most people don't like physics anyway, do they? I could go on endlessly with such niggling observations, but the point is, let's give Stephen Sommers credit where credit is due. He had a much bigger budget than Ed Wood could have ever dreamt of, and yet he still managed to make an even more ridiculous movie than ""Plan 9."" You can't learn that in a physics class. Even more importantly, maybe someday there might be a next generation of MST3K. Can you imagine what a good time they could have with this one? In any case, it's definitely good for laughs, which is more than you can say for much of the crap that comes out of Hollywood nowadays.",Van Helsing
409,Pursewarden,Dumb mishmash,1,6 May 2004,"Stephen Sommers latest is an attempt to profit in the line previously taken by ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" but, of course, with a twist. (I may mention a couple of **spoilers** but this movie is spoiled on origin).Van Helsing (the mythical vampire killer of Bram Stoker´s Dracula) is sort of an immortal slayer searching for monsters (in the first minutes he does Mr. Hyde) to kill with weaponry a la James Bond for the nineteen century. He is cleverly sidekicked with a comic-relief frail to feed him with clever weapons for every season).He meets Beckingsale, a sort of Rumanian warrior part of a clan fighting Dracula for centuries (which V.H. is sent to help to avoid 9 generations of her family skipping Heaven-as dumb as it sounds). Full of CGI and a plot so contrived that keeps the audience laughing where it attempts to thrill, this idiotic mishmash is a definite must avoid for anyone with enough braincells to read the title.Dracula and his women have caves full of ""eggs"" (suspiciously looking like ALIEN cocoons) and are looking for the way for them to live, so they all can dominate the earth (it's never clear why they just don't simply bite a few thousand peasants to populate the region with vampires), and they somehow understand that by using Dr.Frankenstein's machine with a werewolf they can canalize electricity into the ugly cocoons to spawn a few thousand little green demons (that look like suspiciously like the gargoiles from the Hunchback of Notre Dame). The mummy was bad, but was popcorn-watchable-if-you-don't-have-anything-else-to-do, he has gone beyond: this is his worst yet, but we must wonder if his next: Van Helsing II: the mummy of the Louvre, won't go further down.",Van Helsing

Who keeps green-lighting this ass-clowns films? The rest of Holywood must be ecstatic right now knowing they can't possible make the worst film of the year no matter how hard they try.I hope Beckinsale and Jackman were well paid as this will do nothing but harm to both of them.

This show is great fun when you don't argue with yourself over whether Beckinsale falling down a tree would break her back (or a hundred other examples).  Sure it's unreal.  But it's okay to be unreal in movies if it's backed up with good fun.   Helsing is action from start to finish.  It had the potential to be a GREAT movie if they had spent a little more time on the monsters and the filming.   Monsters were sometimes over-the-top and sometimes things just moved TOO fast or were a little too hokey.I liked it.  I gave it an 8.,Van Helsing
412,Myssi from McF,Not so serious monster smash,5,12 July 2004,"Movies like Blade and underworld opened the doors of vampires and werewolves to the big audience once again. Of course this means that there are vultures who want their share of the tasty and rich corpse. This could be a good thing, but in this case it's not. For example comparing Van Helsing to Blade the difference is that Blade is a good movie and comparing to the Underworld difference is that Underworld has credible filming. Sorry Van HelsingMovie is about this radical monster hunter called Van Helsing. Actor Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing is just walking through the movie with basic routine. Nothing special is transferred to the screen. I miss the Wolverine attitude what Hugh gave in X-Men. Movie's worst problem (after that annoying idiot sidekick who is forced to tag alone with Mr. Helsing) is that it tries too much to please everybody. Movie is bit of comedy, action, fantasy, `romance?' and horror. Combining all these factors make the movie only to be below average in every category. It can't be a good action film because it's too busy trying to be scary and so on.. Well the makers of the film have really wanted to invest their multi category story by giving the film over two hours duration. It's pretty rare to have such a long time in this kind of movie but it won't work. Movie is over long and after the first hour it starts repeating itself pretty much and starts to make you pretty bored and numb. If you have to find something good out of the film I have to give a credit of the huge amount of effects they have use. In over two hour film there is not many scenes where CGI graphics aren't used. This is a good thing because so many times effect movies have effects only couple of minutes (the scenes what you see in trailer) and that's that. Rest of the movie is just dull conversation etc. But that's a difference in Van Helsing. Unfortunately the effects used in movie are only in average level, some are almost good and some are bad. But if you like watching effects there's plenty of that in this film. At the end just to keep the movie review in balance and remind that we are talking about a bad movie here, I have to say that the gadgets and guns Helsing were using are too over sci-fi to be only cool or funny, they were embarrassing. Keep away from this one and eat some garlic just to make sure that it keeps away from you.",Van Helsing

The script and parts were slightly funny a times.It all starts when Frankenstein's ""Monster"" is in the windmill trying to save Dr Frankenstein then the people burn it down and it has no choice so it jumps and everyone thinks he is dead.Meanwhile citizens all think Van Helsing is a murderer after killing Mr Hide/Dr Jekel.Then he says he is here to help,Then all of a sudden vampires come and attack.I recommend this film for you as it is awesome!",Van Helsing
414,DaDrill,Even the dubbing was off.,2,8 May 2004,"OK, I was really hoping for something other than a CGI fest.  I was hoping for some of the original Dracula plotline.  Nothing of the sort.  The vampiresses looked believable and one felt that they were flying, but everything else had lead in the feet. How is it those vampires can pick up cows and multiple people, but can't upload Frankenstien? How do people routinely get tossed through solid walls and never even limp? How does Dracula come up in flames, but our hero doesn't, even when they both fall through the same things? The dubbing was way off, like one of those old Japanese flicks, couldn't the director spare time for a tutor in Transylvanian accents.  No love interest here either, very bland. Looked like an even worse remake of DareDevil.  On to the prequel, I suppose. The funniest scene was when an old carraige falls and bursts into flames. I'll bet no one even wondered if it was filled with jet fuel 400 years ago. What a comedy of errors.  Go ahead and watch it, but leave your brain at home.",Van Helsing
415,Triniman,"uninvolving, juvenille",2,8 May 2004,"Van Helsing  1/5After the film, my friend turned to me and said `Aren't you sick of the over-use of computer animation in movies these days?' With Van Helsing, the answer is a resounding YES!  This is yet another film that proves that special effects alone cannot make up for a lousy script.  The best special effects are still the ones you don't know are special effects.With VH going after vampires and werewolves at the same time, you just knew this was going to be a compromise.There's nothing particularly scary in the film. The best monster of all happens to be Dr Frankenstein's monster, who actually does have a heart and a mind.  Hommage is paid to James Bond Q department and maybe a bit of Indiana Jones and Spiderman.  Unlike Indiana Jones, the Van Helsing character is humourless, flat and uninvolving.  The first Spiderman film had a heart.  This film has virtually no pulse.With a rating of PG-14, you knew Van Helsing was going to be a juvenile, silly affair, and it hits the mark precisely.  There's got to be a video game version coming soon.  Is it worth seeing again or buying on DVD?  I don't think so.  Let's hope there won't be a sequel.Review by Triniman",Van Helsing
416,mark-1206,Truly awful,1,6 May 2004,"This came out here today and it was one of the few movies I've ever been tempted to walk out on.One of the worst aspects for me was the standard of the CGI stunts. Please please please, until the standard of CGI improves to the point where you can synthesize a realistic human being then either do the stunts with real people or drop them. I don't want to watch a cartoon figure leap about the screen.Aside from that, the plot jumped all over the place, the sets looked like sets rather than real places and there were several points that inspired unintentional laughter e.g. almost anything with ""the monster"" and Van Helsing howling at the moon. I really wanted to laugh.The director seems to think filming in low light and with very loud music creates atmosphere. Sorry but it takes a bit more than that.A truly appalling film.",Van Helsing
417,firehawk-ws6,Mind-Numbing...but Interesting,5,17 April 2005,"Honestly, I'm neutral on this film. I do remember being stoked to see it, when the trailers were first previewed during the Super Bowl in 2003 (I think that was the year). Then, nothing...it never came out, which left me wondering.Well, now that it's here and I've had a chance to watch it, I can honestly say I'm neither here nor there on it. I can't bring myself to dislike it, because the CGI and elements (c'mon..Wolfman, Dracula, Frankenstein, etc. all in one movie? How cool is THAT!) do make it fun to sit with.However, I'm NOT sold on Ms. Beckinsale's performance...honestly, while very attractive indeed, she just wasn't doing it for me in this movie. The chemistry between her and Jackman seemed, well...a bit ""off."" Maybe it was the fierce independence of both characters. I don't know.The other thing that bugged me was the fact that the CGI does tend to get a little out of hand...such as the jumping from wall to wall, etc. It works great on monster morphs and such, but there are times where you're just going to shake your head at the overkill.Overall, not a waste of time. Any fan of the genre will enjoy watching this movie at least once. Jackman does a good job throughout, and you do find yourself liking him. 5 out of 10 stars.",Van Helsing
418,jrichards2-1,Dismal with highlights,4,22 October 2004,"OK. I admit it. I usually have a soft spot for things like this. I like to see a bit of mindless action every now and again, and as I shuffled into the cinema with my mountain of popcorn I was eager to see the latest take on the vampire story. Yes, my expectations were pretty low, but I still anticipated a certain basic standard.Van Helsing, however, sets itself an extremely low standard which it fails to maintain. A cross bow which fires with the speed of a machine gun. Ridiculous Romanian accents which wouldn't convince a deaf person. A sniveling, cowardly monk who makes a limp attempt to imitate Q from James Bond, and FAILS. I'm sure you're getting the picture. But let's not be too hasty. I'm not saying this has nil points for entertainment value. There is action, even if it is bloated with special effects which make the film look like a computer game. It's simply rather uninspiring and not anything we haven't seen before. Certainly not enough to make up for the poor script, ill-planned plot and disconcerting length, though.Hugh Jackman was the big disappointment for me. He looked like he'd spent a bit too much time applying fake tan; his character was meant to be rough and over-worked, but he turned out far too pretty to be convincing in the role. Overall his performance was dire. Richard Roxborough was much better as Count Dracula (not to mention better looking), but he was also weaker than he should have been. Roxborough is a fair actor and I think he could have made the role more his own if there wasn't so much focus on special effects in the film. Unlike Jackman, he is not beyond redemption.Finally, there is the lovely Kate, who from her clothing I gathered to be some kind of Romanian cowgirl. Well, she can saddle up and ride away, so far as I'm concerned. She was stronger than Jackman, though, and I certainly preferred her to the leering vampiresses. The scene in which she danced with the count was visually one of the most spectacular, although the dialogue was intensely annoying at that point. Nice dress. Wouldn't mind one of those.Well, if I haven't put you off, please get down to a video store right now and rent out Van Helsing. It's not beyond the bounds of possibility that you'll enjoy it. But it isn't a GOOD film, and that's the material point.4 out of 10. The only real highlights are in Hugh Jackman's hair.",Van Helsing

Did it hit the mark? I would say yes. Thanks to a lot of campy acting most of it from Richard Roxburgh as Dracula and a hilarious ""friar,"" Carl played by David Wenham you could either cringe at former or laugh at the latter. Still these two guys steal the film from both Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Also a standout in my opinion is Elena Anaya's screechy vampire bride Aleera who just can't seem to shut up! Apart from that this movie is fast paced and a bit nerve wracking. The downside is too much CGI effects. It's like the special effects is the star of the movie. Everyone else may be except Roxburgh and Wenham are perhaps along for the fast paced ride.",Van Helsing

421,MetroRev,"Ahhh...the summer is here peeps, turn off your brain and enjoy!",1,17 May 2004,"I'll begin with the good things about the movie. ... ...Okay now to the bad. Where could i begin? You have a movie with three of the greatest monsters ever created and things some how go horribly wrong. If i may for a moment say that this movie should've been Castlevania the movie but i'm extremely glad it wasn't as it would've been an insult to the series of video games which had deeper, stronger plots than this thing. Its obnoxiously loud, makes no effort for a little character development and makes some horrible use of the aforementioned monsters, including some sorry excuses for CG. Luckily for Mr. Jackman that he has the XMen franchise to live off of and lucky for Kate Beckinsale that she is a hottie because neither of these two have offered much of anything else in any of their other movies and offer even less in this one(what is up with that accent Kate?). Van Helsing makes quick work of getting its characters into situations where they look cool and say cool things. Unfortunately they end up not looking so cool and saying things that are irritating. Its as if the characters know they are in a movie and know that they can't be stopped because the script says so!I'll finish off with this last thing. I subject myself to all kinds of movies. I enjoy great, timeless dramas as much as do dumb summer fair so its not as if i'm a pretentious film student who can't turn off the brain and enjoy some eye candy. There is room for all kinds of films in my mind and neither is more or less important. Anywho, I DO NOT walk out of a movie for any reason, not even to pee. I'm there, i'm giving two hours of my time for the movie. This is my philosophy and for 20 plus years of movie watching i've NEVER once walked out. For Van Helsing i not only took a trip to the bathroom but i went for a cigarette too! I could care less about what was happening which is a sign that not one character was interesting. Not one character seemed genuine nor interesting. So welcome in the summer crop of Hollywood crap with open arms and blank stares, its going to be one long summer movie season!",Van Helsing

If you say this movie is bad you must be in another world. Van Helsing may be a rip-off of the old detective, but with a young person doing the part they can make him do a back flip. if it where the old one we would be watching an old guy putting his fingers into a cross. The surprise ending with his love dying is the perfect touch of tragedy, because all great hero's lose someone. like spider man has lost 4 girls ( 3 to many ). but anyway this movie is the best. warning: this movie is not for the faint of heart or really touchy people. please don't tell your siblings the surprise ending! my sister did the same thing and i did'nt enjoy it as much as i should have. this will stand for at least the next 10-20 years.-Fletch",Van Helsing
423,zorn24601,A treat for fans of the classic monsters...,8,8 May 2004,"As a fan of the classic monsters from the old Universal Studios films, I was probably bound to enjoy this film no matter how bad it turned out. If you're a fan of the old films...Lugosi's 'Dracula', Karloff's 'Frankenstein', and Chaney Jr.'s 'The Wolf Man', and all the myriad sequels...you're apt to like this film, and see its flaws as forgivable. After all, the old films, particularly the ones from the 1940's, were far from perfect.And there are flaws. The plot is overwrought, the acting by many of the supporting roles is at times wooden, the Wolf Man (I refer to Velkan; there's more than one werewolf in this film) doesn't have enough screen time, and some of the fight scenes (especially near the end) go on way too long. And the second scene of the film (with Van Helsing fighting Mr. Hyde) is completely unnecessary.However, when this film is on, it's on in style. The opening scene is hard to top; the creation of the Monster, Dracula trying to take control of the Monster, an angry mob chasing the Monster to an old windmill, and the pathos of the Monster as the windmill burns, all in black and white as a beautiful tribute to the classic films. The portrayals of Dracula and the Frankenstein Monster would have made Lugosi and Karloff happy; their signature characters are handled as though they were directing Roxburgh and Hensley themselves.If you aren't a fan of the old classic monster movies, you probably won't be too impressed with 'Van Helsing'. However, as long as you go understanding that this is a popcorn film, a movie to enjoy with your higher brain taking a snooze, you'll like it. It's just as much fun as Sommers' Mummy films.
And if you are a fan of Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr., this film is an absolute blast. Do not miss it.8/10 stars if you like popcorn films, probably 5/10 otherwise.",Van Helsing

I have never seen such a wasteful film in all my life. Endless wasted opportunities and more damage done to Universal's horror icons than Lucas could ever do to Star Wars. As a movie it fails. As a kid's movie it fails. It's possible to make an intelligent film that appeals to both adults and children - the original Star Wars trilogy and The Lord Of The Rings are proof of this. Violence without bloodshed is a useless paradox - I can't believe that no-one watching this monstrosity being assembled didn't decide to end it down the line.

425,prtfvr,Oh So Bad!,4,9 May 2004,"Incohesive, confusing (and I use the word loosely) plot, poorly edited, obnoxious female lead, Bono is Bela Lugosi, and Frankenstein's Monster apparently has a Harvard degree! Don't get me started on the ""Romanian"" accents. And vampires in daylight? What gives?!I expected so much more from writer/director Stephen Sommers. After all, he gave us The Mummy which was a great flick and even The Mummy Returns, while not great, wasn't that bad. But this is horrible. The only reason that I gave such a high score (4) was because Hugh Jackman is actually good in it. Kate Beckinsdale (Underworld) is woefully miscast as the female lead. What acting!! No, really. I mean WHAT acting? There was a lot of over-acting though so if you're going by quantity and not quality she was perfect! And her character has no where near the cool she thinks that she's projecting. Besides, should she really be doing two vampire movies in a row?
The actor playing Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) looked like Bono from U2 which was distracting enough but that poor man's Bela Lugosi accent not to mention another over the top performance. UGH!The jokes were funny, especially the reference to Jackman's famous role, Wolverine. Only problem is that there were a lot of unintentionally funny things as well. And I never could work up any deep feelings for the characters. Look for Kevin J. O'Connell (The Mummy) as Igor. He's really funny although unrecognizable.Van Helsing is a great character and I especially liked the Vampire Hunter D outfit. I'd take a chance on another one because it's too good of an idea the screw up the second time...right?OH! Almost forgot! The special F/X were great! And that's one of the reasons that the movie is so horrible. The effects pointed out the terrible, and I use the term loosely, plot. Still, I think it's worth a sequel if the script is right.",Van Helsing

Those images of ghosts in the clouds at the end were soooooooooo cheesy! I would have hated this movie a little less without that pathetic display of amateurism.  They could have cut at least 30 minutes of garbage from this movie. The Mummy is not really good, but this movie...  Well, it was indeed a little better than the League of Extraordinay Gentleman, but that's not much to say, is it?  It starts well, and then it gets worse and worse... finally, you have that pathetic ending.",Van Helsing
427,bondfan27,"Werewolves, Vampires, And Frankenstein! O My! 'Van Helsing' Is A Monsterous-ly Good Time! * * * 1/2 (Out Of 4 Stars)",9,15 May 2004,"I remember all the way back to the good ol' days of B&W, where Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr. ruled the horror silver screen. Nowadays, horror has expanded to evil maniacs, crazy monsters, and oddball zombie flicks. It's just not as scary as they 3 originals did it. Thank god that Steven Sommers (Of 'The Mummy' fame) has brought the 3 classic monsters: Drac, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein, back to the silver screen to rule over again. In ""Van Helsing"" I found myself at awe with the film. Hype has lead it to be this summers first blockbuster. With summer blockbusters you get a great mix of: action, comedy, special effects, and of course, the loose plot. Summer blockbusters were never meant to be analyzed. They were made just to go in, have some popcorn, and come out smiling. ""Van Helsing"" is the perfect example of a summer blockbuster. Hugh Jackman is charming and exciting as Gabriel Van Helsing, who's life work is to rid the world of monsters. Working for a secret society in Rome, he must travel to Translyvania to fight Dracula. What he comes upon is much more. There he meets more then just one vampire, but three more: Dracula's brides. He also runs into Frankenstein, who we find out was ""created by and for evil, but not ruled by it"", making the monster a gentle creature who just wants to help Van Helsing. Kate Beckinsale, who was just hot of the success of ""Underworld"" as a vampire as turned her roles right around, as the beautiful Anna Valerious, the last of the Valerious' who's life's work is to rid the world of Dracula as well. On their way, they run into the Wolfman, who is all special effect, and rightfully so, since it fits. I enjoyed how the transformation of man to wolf starts. Don't expect special effects from the original 'The Wolfman'. And of course, Dracula, played by Richard Roxborough doesn't quite hit the mark on his impression of Dracula (Or Bela). You, willingly or not, will automatically try a comparison to him and Lugosi. Does he top it? No, but he adds a new, more sadistic sense to the image. I did enjoy his performance. The film, a special effects extravaganza, is one of the most impressive works as FX goes. Amazing shots of Rome, Translyvania mountains, and inside masquerades make the locations amazing. The monsters, most of the pure FX are impressive, yet corny. The vampires switch from human-like form to more demon-vampire mode. When they do, they grow giant mouthfuls of fangs, about a foot long each. It looks hokey, but still fun to smile at. Like I was saying it being the perfect summer blockbuster: it's true. Amazing special effects light up and ignite the action throughout the film, the plot acts hokey, dumb, silly, but highly enjoyable, and also it is loose. Very loose. You will question scenes and moments at least more then twice to yourself. I tip my hat to Stephen Sommers, who keeps the film on fire from beginning to end. It also kept my mind spinning from beginning to end as well. Lugosi, Karloff, and Chaney Jr. would be proud.My Rating:   * * * 1/2 (Out Of Four) 8 (Out Of 10 On The IMDB) A- (A+=Highest, F=Lowest)",Van Helsing
428,wxid,One monster turkey.,3,10 May 2004,"Van Helsing will strike fear into any sane movie-goer's heart. The movie is one incredible failure that should never have seen the inside of a cinema.The premise is cheesey, but at least has potential for some light entertainment. The concept of bringing together a collection of famous, nay infamous, horror creatures for a piece of cheesey villainy could have been carried off so much better.However the complete lack of story-telling skill, the overwhelmingly tedious computer generated effects, and the absence of any sense of threat from Dracula himself render the movie simply a waste of time.Events happen that have no bearing on the remainder of the film, and action sequences are dragged out for what seems like hours. Plot threads are created, and then abandoned and ignored when they no longer suit the director's requirements. The entire end sequence is one example - a clearly expressed deadline is simply forgotten with no ill effects.The only redeeming features of Van Helsing are the black and white intro sequence - cheesey and corny, but at least entertainingly so - and the sight of Kate Beckinsale in a fabulously sexy outfit.For all the monsters Van Helsing has slain, the one he missed most was the one that should have died at birth. This enormous monstrous turkey of a movie.",Van Helsing
429,cobra-8,"Move over Buffy, bring on Van Helsing",10,13 May 2004,"This was a brilliantly exciting movie. The whole time it kept me guessing what was going to happen next. It incorporates my two favourite classic monsters, Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) and the Wolfman (Will Kemp). It throws Frankenstein's Monster into the mix as well, and the three stories are all very well combined.I was surprised to find David Wenham in the movie, and even more so to find him providing the comic relief. He changed since LotR - from tall, elegant warrior to squat, eccentric monk - er, friar.All the actors/tresses delivered smashing performances. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) was a very 1800's James Bond. Anna (Kate Beckinsale) was quite fiery. Dracula was perfectly evil. Carl (David Wenham) was great for a good laugh. Finally, Dracula's brides (Elena Alaya, Josie Maran, and Silvia Colloca) were spectacularly sexy, possibly the most so I've seen in cinema yet.The previews make it out to have no plot whatsoever, but that is not the case. The plot was not *terribly* intricate, but juicy enough to disqualify the movie from the ""mindless action"" category. I recommend this movie to those who are looking for a pulse-pounding, dryly comic, and suspenseful ride.Once again, this was a great film.",Van Helsing
430,wee_scottish_lassie,funny but truly awful,7,7 January 2005,"I have to say that I thought this film was absolute rubbish. This is because it was all so exaggerated.. I thought it was going to be a scary/horror type of film but it wasn't. There was no suspense, no horror, just nothing to make you feel scared at all. Nothing like what I expected.On the plus side I was laughing all the way through it cos of how corny and ridiculous it was. I was laughing so much I was crying, but in a good way.If you go and see this film then don't expect anything thought provoking, scary or constructive in any way. Just expect to have a good laugh at things which I am sure were not intentionally funny. Or if you're not in a funny mood then you'll probably be reaaallly bored",Van Helsing

With its veritable monster-mash of Dracula, his heinous brides, Dwerger minions and deranged servant Igor, as well as Frankenstein's monster and werewolves, all boxes are ticked and the character variety helps the plot from running dry at any point. Obviously there are moments of incredulity (such as constant falls from great heights), but what else would you expect from a fantasy fable and since the film doesn't take itself too seriously neither should you and just enjoy the fun.",Van Helsing

433,soniagoenaga25,A very interesting movie,10,17 May 2004,"Last week I saw 'Van Helsing' and to tell you the truth I really think that critics are very bad with his comments about this film. Lots of them think that this is just a film for having a good time and nothing else, but in my opinion there are some things which must be considered. In the first place, the combination of the three monsters, Dracula (the sexiest Dracula I have ever seen, much better and more attractive than others),Frankestein and the Warewolfman is original and it  has  never seen in movies such a mixture of three different stories. On the other hand, the story itself is not only original but also interesting because it catches the attention of the audience and from the beginning to the end everybody is expecting what is going to happen. But the best thing is the perfomance of the Australian actors Richard Roxburgh (an incredibly fascinating vampire)and Hugh Jackman (a very funny and interesting hero. Both of them are perfect as enemies whose interest is to destroy each other, although I would have personally preferred Dracula to have won the battle, ha,ha,ha. Is it a coincidence that both sexy characters like Van Helsing and Dracula are played by Australian perfomers? This confirms that men from this nation are very handsome.",Van Helsing
434,soniagoenaga25,"An interesting film with the best Dracula, an incredibly sexy Richard Roxburgh, I have ever seen, apart from Chistopher Lee, of course!",10,20 May 2004,"I have recently seen Van Helsing, film which I really enjoyed due to different factors. In the first place it is absolutely original the mixture of the three classical monsters of the universal literature, Dracula (excellent Richard Roxburgh), Frankenstein and the Werewolf. Never have I seen such an adventure, my God! From the beginning to the end the whole film catches the attention of the audience and it is totally impossible to get bored. Despite what some critics say about this movie, there are very good things that critics do not want to accept, for example, the story, as I said above, is very creative, not only because of the mixture of the three monsters, but also because it shows perfectly the atmosphere of Transilvania created by the great imagination of Bram Stoker. In addition to this I must say that thanks to the brilliant perfomance of all the cast, but specially thanks to the highly attractive Australian actors Richard Roxburgh, whom I consider the best and sexiest Dracula I have ever seen (with the permission of the great Christopher Lee), and Hugh Jackman, another Aussie who plays very well his role as Van Helsing and whose transformation as a werefolf suits on him very wel, I did not get bored while watching it. Another question, is it a coincidence that both  masculine roles are played by Australian boys? (It is very well-known that men from Australia are very handsome. I have also read some commentaries in which a boy from Poland said that Richard Roxburgh is not very good as Dracula, does this mean that this Polish boy could do it better than Richard? Of course not. I would add another thing, Richard plays very  well his role and moreover, neither Bela Lugosi nor other actors in the same role, have never had the same glamour as Richard. He has an air of romanticism which gives him the impression of being a human being with feelings and a sense of pain due to its constant battle between Evil and Good. In conclussion, it is not just a fascinating film to see but also an adventure plenty of action, love and good perfomances. I liked it so much that in fact, I am going to see it again. All the cast is brilliant but for me personally Richard is the best and deserves all the best in this world in which it is very difficult to have a main role in Hollywood when being a foreigner.",Van Helsing
435,sjl004,"Good characters, fun film",5,16 June 2004,"Its over the top with some crazy fantasy put in to boot. Decent accent by Kate Beckinsale only, Hugh sounds a cross between Harrison Ford and Hugh Grant and his sidekick is a fleshed out C3PO.Stephen Sommers has had a memorable stab at the thirties classics, including the obvious and the Bride of Frankenstein, although the most detailed character is the monster, a little more wouldn't go amiss. The trouble with the film is the high octane action with no room to breathe, like Die Another Day. The character I was most looking forward to was the The Wolfman, whom has a confusing storyline that with the fighting against Van Helsing becomes the rest of the films main suspense. A sham, because the mood could have handled a rest, creating a nest errie surrounding. The ending is like a scene from King Kong, a similarity with the end of T2 and a bit of a Tarzan Lookalike in there as well. The musical score is not hitting the target particularly the horse carriage scene. Generally the plot strengthens during the film, but not to make is a great one to watch. Unfortunately the film adapted a pure action flick rather than a restrained thriller, which giving the potential atmosphere would have been a real bloodsucking treat.",Van Helsing

437,InakiArias,Epic fail.,4,11 July 2013,"Tom Cruise is going to be the new Van Helsing and some of the IMDb's users are so frustrated that they talk about this movie with nostalgia.OK, even if Tom is hated (mostly in USA) it's impossible that any movie with him inside could be half of bad that Sommer's Van Helsing is.Van Helsing, Stoker's vampire hunter and, in overall, a mighty character. The promise of the appearance of the greatest cinema monsters of all-times. A solvent director like Stephen Sommers after having directed ""The Mummy"" and its sequel. Great cast with Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale at the top of their careers and an astronomical budget. This movie had everything to become a big success, but the result was one of the worst movies I have ever watched in a cinema.I'm a soft reviewer. For me, it's very hard to give something lesser than 5 out 10 to a movie, because I enjoy so much the cinema that is near impossible to get me so disappointed to consider a movie a fail. At least with last 15 years's movies. It's very hard to find a masterpiece but it's also true that it's hard to watch a really bad movie. Furthermore, and to be honest, if the movie has a low Budget or my expectations are not too high my critical capability is inferior than when I'm watching a hyped blockbuster like this. The movie fails in everything. Bad story, worse script, childish dialogs... those are things that can be ignored in a fantasy movie like this and it would have been a great movie even with those flaws. But, I repeat, this movie lacks everything. Visuals are pathetic for a 160 million giant. Cgis are horrible, and action scenes are poor. Drácula is everything but frightening, Notre Damme's hunchback is ridiculous and Frankestein... Frankestein gave me the best moments of the movie because is absolutely laughable. With this, it should be enough to consider this film a big fail, but I would give it a 5 out 10 if it wasn't for the ending. The ending is directly the worst and the most ridiculous ending I can remember in a movie. Please note I'm talking about first class, Hollywood made cinema, OK? Crap like ""troll 2"" or ""Aliens vs Avatars"" are another, disgusting, thing.In conclusion, this is one of the ten worst mainstream movies I can remember, tied with ""Green Lantern"".",Van Helsing
438,Virgil2127,A Not-So-Magnificent Failutre,5,16 May 2006,"Stephen Sommers made ""The Mummy"", once just Boris Karloff cashing in on the Egyptology craze, cool again, injecting a campy sensibility into the fun summer flick. Were he only as succeessful in ""Van Helsing"" as he was in ""The Mummy"", and heck, even the mediocre ""Mummy Returns"".What's not working in Van Helsing? Well, first the titular character has no descernable connection to Abraham Van Helsing, one of Dracula's primary foes in the Bram Stoker novel. I'm convinced Hugh Jackman was born to play Wolverine, but the same cannot be said about Van Helsing - both heroes don't know their past, but with Van Helsing, no one really seems to care.Kate Beckinsale is a tremendously beautiful and gifted actress. Unfortunately, she's saddled with a thick Translyvanian accent that would give Bela Lugosi a run for his money. About midway through the film, Beckinsale seems so frustrated with the consistency of the accent, she seems to just drop it - which is a considerable mercy.The same can be said of the film's werewolf - it begins life an fearsome and furry CGI creation, but by the end, the producers don't seem to be trying, and the werewolf, much like the movie, seems to be in full video game mode. By now, the werewolf has lost most of its physical weight and all of its bite.Roxbough's Dracula and his brides seem to be bi-polar. Apparently realized he's no Gary Oldman, Roxbough compensates by freaking out a lot. He's not really that scary.Igor looks like Gary Busey. He's really that scary.So what is working in this film?

439,ChibiAnna,Pretty but lacking in substance,5,30 January 2005,"Let's see. All the previous flicks that involved Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Dr. Jekyll/Hyde, and/or the Tooth Fairy, were hardly known to b cinematic masterpieces. Unfortunately, Van Helsing keeps up the trend: a plastic array of special effects without any message or lasting 'That was COOL!!'.The original characters- Gabe Van Helsing and Anna (my name! mwee!)- were rather cardboardy. Anna's accent has already been commented on, and frankly, it's awful. Helsing himself is the stereotypical action hero: brave, in love with the leading lady, and otherwise completely personality-free. Karl is also a cardboard cutout for the first half of the movie, only getting some backbone once someone needs to make like Tarzan and swing on a rope.Dracula ... well, I haven't seen either him or Richard Roxburg before, but I was a bit unsatisfied with his performance. Sensual? Yes- TOO sensual. You are playing the part of a blood-sucking, 400-year-old vessel of pure evil. You CANNOT BE THAT PRETTY. Rrgh! Drac's 'brides' were indeed very pretty. However, their transition scenes often looked unimpressive.The CGI was eye candy. Being candy, it was gorgeous but left no lasting mark. The werewolves were cute and fluffy (bad move!), and many of the CG scenes were.... well... they were pretty, but fake. So fake. Sighhhh.However, the cow was cool.Overall: 5/10.

I hated The Mummy Returns with a passion but that looks like one of the greatest movies of all time compared to Van Helsing.Not only does this movie have a script that appears to have been thrown together by drawing words out of a hat, Stephen Sommers also appears to have drawn movie cliche's out of a hat and thrown them into his film wherever he gets the chance!  This movie is really that bad that I was in stitches laughing.  Kate Beckinsale is her usually awful self, Hugh Jackman does all he can with the stupid script and ""that guy who plays Dracula"" has a good look, but cannot pull off a Romanian Accent.With Dracula being perhaps the coolest bad guy in movie history, why can nobody ever produce a good film involving him?  If you found Underworld to be entertaining or even good, God help you, then this movie is for you. However if you have seen more than a few films, you will realise how incredibly cheesy and stupid this film is.

The acting (didn't anyone tell Kate her accent sucked???) was very stiff and unbelievable.  The dialog was something only a three year old could be proud of and the plot...??? Well all I can say is what the hell were they thinking?  Those little pod babies were ridiculous at best.Casting is another issue with this flick.  Couldn't they find anyone even slightly creepy to play Count Dracula?  Someone with some screen personality?  Frankie was the only appropriate casting choice here.  Kate's accent came off sounding darn silly, and her only purpose seemed to be showing just how tight she could cinch that corset.A good indication of the weak plot were the group of giggling and heckling teenagers seated behind me.

It's a pretty solid action adventure fantasy movie with diffrent monsters from diffrent classics mixed. And the specialFX is pretty solid aswell as the scenery is breathtaking at times. With some small tweaks here and there this could aswell been a Castlevania movie. You find almost everything from the Castlevania games in it, and would it have gone this route i think people would have liked it even more.
Insert Simon Belmont with the vampyre killer and add some more fight scenes and uped the horror a small bit and it would have been Castlevania the movie.
Instead we have Van helsing with a forgotten past that works like a early James Bond agent for the Vatican church. Like James Bond he has his Q in the shape of a priest instead.
Some parts of this movie somehow makes me feel like im watching a movie from the past, when fantasy movies like Krull or even Conan the barbarien did their own thing. And it succeds to entertain eventho it isent a Classic like the ones i mention, and some parts are more dull then others after a viewing or two.

Instead of investing any intrest in the main characters, I found myself rooting for the town undertaker/gravedigger who seemed to possess the innate ability to lead every Transylvanian mob. The only positive thing I could say about this movie is that the graphics involved in animating a flying vampiress/demoness have progressed greatly since the days of Sam Raimi's Army of Darkness. In fact, instead of wasting any of your money on this overblown piece of $#!*, go out and rent Army of Darkness. You'll get more that your money's worth with twice the plot!

It consists of a leather trenchcoat, leather hat, leather boots, and a grey, ribbed, turtleneck sweater.  It looks more like a Berlin clubbing outfit than anything else.This movie takes place before the 20th century obviously, so how on earth did Van Helsing get his hands on a grey, ribbed, turtleneck sweater before the 1960's!  The people behind this movie could have at least TRIED to make the outfit look like it came from over a century ago.....instead of raiding Ricky Martin's closet from 1998.Moving on (thought I don't want to), the rest of the movie is just below average.  Details:
The CGI comes off as just average.  The good points are the fusion of CGI on the vampires faces when they open their mouths wide to take bites.  Also the CGI artwork of Dracula's brides are also done quite well.  The backgrounds are also excellent, but alot of fog effects cover up any mistakes.  The bad....Dracula for starters.  He looks like he just walked off the set of the Golden Child.  Extemely cartoony...just plain bad.  The werewolfs also looks cartoony as well.  And Dracula's spawn just look like little video game monsters.....too cartoony.
The acting.  KILL ME NOW before I here anymore horrible eastern-european accents.  The guy who played Dracula was the worst...by far....so cheesy. Hugh Jackman did fine, but his role was limited to the serious action hero and all he had to do was not deliver his lines like Vin Diesel.  Kate Beckingsale had the only role that showed a great range of emotion and had the ability to show acting prowess.  Unfortunately, with a cheesy accent and forced emotion, she failed at this.Story....what story?  Why was dracula releasing werewolves?  Why did Dracula need Frankenstein if had the Doctors equipment?  Could Frankenstein have been anymore pointless?  Why does Dracula even care to kill off Kate Beckingsale's family?

There were some parts that were great but it seemed that they had 3/4 of a movie when they started and figured they will just rap it up in the end. Some of the fight scenes were just right for what you would think these mythical characters would look like getting it on and they tie the charicters together very well.

I would have prefered Dracula to be more elegant, Sir Cristopher Lee was available and seeing as he wouldn't have to do any action (that was ALL CGI) It would have been a perfect fit. I enjoyed the movie it was full of action and had a story that I could suspend disbelief for, seeing as everybody already knows whom the Wolfman,Dracula,Fankenstein,Van Helsing are there was no need to tell their stories again so we could get right into the action.It was a good thing the Vatican send Van Helsing to Transylvania, because Kate alone wouldn't have lasted 5 minutes with those monsters. you would have thought fighting your WHOLE life against Dracula and his minions would give you some insight (daylight raid ?!), she could have been a strong woman character but wasn't. Dracula was nice in a campy sort of way though not really scary in any form. Van Helsing was good and looked great in the hat and played his role though it wasn't much different from Wolverine... Igor was good, come with Dracula because you're my Goon now. Frankenstein's monster was good and brought meaning to: never judge a book by it's collar. the Brides looked and acted great and where the real menace instead of Dracula IMHO.

Yes, one might call the plot a bite trite- the same story has been done in one way or another several times that I can think of, but with just a bit more imagination, it could have worked. However, the writing was only adequate at best, and the acting, well... let's just say I enjoyed Hugh Jackman better in Kate & Leopold! Kate Beckinsale- the best thing I can say about her is at least she's pretty! Her acting was horrific and the poor girl couldn't have been costumed worse if my seven-year-old cousin drew the clothing on a paper towel!
Each character seemed to be ripped from the pages of every bad Dracula/Frankenstein knock off ever made. Bram Stoker's Dracula it is not! Gee, it's not even Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series(even I wouldn't say Van Helsing was as bad as the Buffy movie)! The three brides of Dracula, think the movie Hocus Pocus (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker) add 5 cent vampire teeth from a vending machine and there ya go. The overall feel of the film reminded me of a bad 1980's B horror film with just a bit of the old soap opera, Dark Shadows. You could have given be a computer from 1974 and I probably could have come up with better graphics and special effects. OK, OK it wasn't a total waste. There was one bright spot. David Wenham was absolutely adorable as Carl, the geeky genius friar side-kick. He was funny, lovable, witty and if the rest of the film was even a trifle better, he'd have been a brilliant supporting actor. As we all know however, one actor can't save a film.Now, I never said I did this for a living, but I know what I like and I can tell you, VAN HELSING IS NOT IT! There's no reason to spend any money or your time running out to see this film. Wait for it to come on HBO/Cinemax/Showtime/TMC/Starz real late at night when you can't sleep. THEN, and MAYBE ONLY then would it be worth it.",Van Helsing
452,madam_Q,Check your brain at the door,2,9 May 2004,"*MINOR SPOILERS*What do you get when you take a woeful script, an incoherent story and a bucket load of special effects?  Why, it must be Van Helsing!In the interest of fairness, I'll start with what I liked about this movie. The visuals is striking and the production design outstanding.  Every set is suitably moody and atmospheric.  The special effects are the real star of the show, no surprises there, and are beautifully done.  I suspect, however, that this has something to do with the fact that virtually every scene takes place in near darkness and that hides a multitude of sins.  The action is also outstanding- the stunt work is well done and there are a couple of great set pieces.However, this is not enough.  Much has been made of how bad the script is and unfortunately it is truly appalling- the actors founder with characters lacking any depth or chemistry.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale have both been better.  Kate's career has been on a steady downer since Pearl Harbour- does this girl have a thing for overblown, special effects laden tripe where she gets to wear tight costumes or what?  And as for Hugh, there were a couple of points where I got the feeling he was going to nod off and go to sleep.  His job was to look surly, wield impressive weapons (Freud would have a field day here) and occasionally come out with the sort of droll one liners that would be better placed in the next Die Hard movie.  A mysterious guy with an anger management problem and no clue about his past? Gee, Hugh, where have we seen THAT before.The supporting players fare no better.  David Wenham is wasted in the standard 'sidekick' role, Richard Roxborough chews scenery as Count Dracula and the less said about his brides the better- all three of them act from the cleavage and are about as frightening as a clown at a kid's birthday party.I could go on- the story is all over the place and the finale leaves several loose ends untied.  Van Helsing's burning quest is to find out his origins. He doesn't.  This can mean only one thing- a sequel...or even worse, a franchise.  Yeesh.  There are too many gaps in the plot, too many developments left unexplained. Why is Frankenstein's monster so critical?  Where exactly do the werewolves fit into to it all?  Yes, this is a monster movie, but too often things just seem to be inserted because they look cool rather than them having any relevance to the plot.  It all slaps of sloppy film making.  It's similiar in many ways to The Mummy, but unlike that movie, this is seriously lacking in humour.  The fun quotient just isn't there.'What do you expect, it's only a popcorn flick' is the defense I've heard most often.  I'm sorry, but no.  I've seen enough examples of good popcorn flicks to know that some things are inexcusable.  Even action fans deserve good dialogue and a story that makes sense.  Pirates of the Caribbean is the example that most readily jumps to mind.  Even though there were several plot gaps there too, you were having too good a time to really notice.Save your money.  Rent X-Men and Underworld, make it a double bill and call it a night.",Van Helsing
453,ProfessorMovieMovie,A total mess!!! Did they make this up as they went along??,1,15 October 2005,"I really do wish there was a zero in the drop down list! Giving this mess of a movie a one is far to generous.I enjoyed both the mummy movies for what the were; action packed fun with a small plot that was enough to keep the movie going. However, Sommers latest 'homage' to the old monster movie classics is a mess that I don't think even Rubix could figure out.Way over the top and corny acting from Roxburgh who plays Dracula, three screaming murderous vampire/harpy brides of Dracula who are just plain annoying and horrible cgi that is way over used is just the beginning in a long list of why this film is so bad.Did anyone actually read the script before they began shooting or did they just make it up as they went along??? The one interesting plot twist, that Van Helsing is somehow connected to Dracula becoming a vampire 400 years before, is NEVER fully explained! I sincerely hope this does NOT mean a sequel is on its way.Well, I could say more about the bad acting, lack of any real story, overuse of the great music to push the boring scenes along, etc... but I won't. Just suffice to say if you do see this film, make sure you are not expecting ANYTHING out of it. It really is that bad.",Van Helsing

To be honest I didn't think that the acting was the best, but the action from the plot kind of made up for it. This is a movie I watched before when I was young and re-watching it now, the middle part of the movie is a little confusing. I liked how they added a little romance throughout all the action that was going. However, I feel like it started slowing down towards the end.",Van Helsing

456,Tito32,Van Helsing - film we all should fear!,4,10 November 2004,"And this is S.Sommers homage to the great old horror films of Universal studio? This is,without any exaggeration,the poorest excuse of a movie I have seen in a while.When a single movie menages to destroy everything you love and cherish about creature features of old,Dracula,Frankenstein and werewolf it's time to realize that this guy shouldn't be allowed near anything remotely similar, ever again. How can you take three of the most legendary creatures,huge amounts of money,pretty useful actors and turn it into year biggest letdown?There is so much that's incredibly bad and laughable about this movie that I wont even try writing about all of it cause it would take a couple of days! I have seen every S.Sommers movie and it is only The Mummy that's even close to being a reasonably good movie, next to Deep Rising, which I truly enjoyed. Entertaining B-movie and fully aware of it, thats one of the things that made it work. Here he has much more money and he end up creating a turd. Effects are even worse then in The Mummy Returns (not included Scorpion King off course-still the worst CG effect ever) and that's saying a lot. The movie feels more like Shreck or Finding Nemo than horror adventure or whatever he tried to make. God only knows!All the clichés/stereotypes are used over and over again. Poorly choreographed action sequences, overacting, laughable attempts at local accent and the dialog taken straight out of Hammer classics. The plot is probably written by his 8-year old nephew.Draculas brides are laying eggs ?! (the castle feels more like something taken from ""Aliens"" than 17th century). And as for Dracula - there is ""The Daddy"" of all the evil creatures,the very name should cause fear. In Van Helsing we have the pleasure of seeing one of the worst casting choice for the role ever (at least for production this big - Dracula is supposed to appear menacing while this one looks like Elton Johns new lover or some Liberace wannabe! I was expecting a scene where he bites Van Helsings balls,not the neck. One thing is certain - after watching this crap,I will never look at those creatures,even this type of films again.",Van Helsing
457,thenatureboy,If you go in expecting Shakespeare...,7,9 May 2004,"you will leave disappointed, BUT, this is a good, fun movie.The Special Effects are great, as is the action.  The plot is a little thin, but I rank it as good as Frank Langella having a mid-air love scene in his 70's version of the Dracula tale.  How much plot do you REALLY expect in a movie with Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankenstein's Monster?  Please!  And, it was pretty obvious that much like the ""mummy"" movies, that this one did not take it self too seriously (which doomed ""the matrix"" sequels).  Would everyone have felt better if Dracula and Van Helsing had a round table discussion on the Vatican Holy Knights?The bottom line is that if you want some fun, go see this movie.  If not, save the money and buy a Bob Woodward book.",Van Helsing
458,ebhp1,"Simply, amazingly...terrible.",5,27 August 2004,"I really, really wanted to like this film.  I love Stephen Sommers' earlier work and the relative simplicity of complicated films.  He brings a fun, energetic approach as evidenced by the Mummy movies.  That was a formula that really worked with good performances by all involved, with comedy and suspense at the right moments.Van Helsing was unfortunately a big, cheesy bore with painful one-line dialogue born from the Schwarzenegger school of screenwriting.  I gave it a 5/10 rating, but it only gets the 5 stars because of the amazing effects and cool creatures that have never been done before on film.  Bravo to the visual effects team, but that's about it.SPOILERS AHEADThere were several plot holes in the film that I won't go into...plus the ""rules"" of the world created in the film were violated on several occasions. Example - in the very end Frankenstein is chained to the roof and one more lightning strike will set off the tragic chain of events.  All that's preventing him from getting off the lightning rod is one chain-link around his ankle.  But, he can't break the chain, despite being incredibly strong (as proven earlier in the film).  Yes, this is perhaps a stupid example for those die-hard VH vans, but it violates Screenwriting 101.  Set your rules and then live by them, otherwise the logic fails and the viewer doesn't believe in the tale.Would I recommend seeing the film if you're looking for a visually entertaining movie with the surround-sound cranked up at home and you really like ""tent pole"" action films?  Absolutely.  Just don't set your hopes up for greatness and you should have a moderately enjoyable 2 hours.  If, however, you don't cringe at a dozen or so ridiculous moments and wonder why the film took that path or the actor spoke those sophomoric words...I'll either be really surprised or I'll glady wish you a happy 13th birthday.ebhp",Van Helsing
459,samzzz-69448,What a waste of potential,4,22 August 2017,"In light of Universal's lukewarm attempt at kicking start their planned Dark Universe earlier this summer with the underwhelming The Mummy reboot, I was suddenly reminded of Van Helsing, the supposed big budget summer season starter of 2004 for which the studio must have carried similar hopes, but ended up way short.With the Mummy reboot, one could lay blame chiefly on the chaotic script which was beyond salvageable, not to mention Mr. Cruise himself allegedly spent months in the editing room after principal shooting. Cruise also brought his long time collaborator, Mission:Impossible writer/director Christopher McQuarrie to help with the script during development. Yet with a script like that, there was not much veteran playwright but first time blockbuster director Kurtzmann could do. With Van Helsing, it becomes harder to throw blames around.Do you blame the incoherent and totally predictable mess of a plot to the badly written script? I suppose you could. Do you blame the million or so clichés and bad dialogue on the script, too? I suppose you could. Do you blame the absolutely horrible, laughably bad fake Eastern European accents uttered by Kate Beckinsale, Richard Roxborough (just about the least menacing or scary villain they could have come up with), and David Wenham (whose sidekick character is the antithesis of funny) and over the top dramatic acting on the director? Again, I suppose you could. Since the film is written and directed by the same person, riding on the success of the two Mummy films, I guess that means you can just blame him then?Yes and no. Universal's decision to put so many of their classic monsters into one popcorn summer movie with no clue whether it is supposed to be a horror, or fun action-adventure so it ended up being neither is also part of the problem, and a major part at that. The idea of making several solo origin movies first, and if these were successful, then make an ensemble tentpole obviously wasn't so hot back in 2004. Would the film have done differently if it were to come out 10 years later, under a director director? I doubt that too, seeing how The Mummy 3, The Wolfman, Dracula Untold and finally Tom Cruise's The Mummy turned out. It's totally understandable for Universal to be obsessed with their classic horror monster IPs, in the same way WB never seem to be able to let go of the classic folk legend IPs such as Pan/Jack the Giant Slayer/King Arthor that have caused them mostly flops. I'm sorry to say this, but Universal genuinely seem clueless at developing their horror monster IPs, ever since The Mummy returns 16 years ago.Credit where it's due, the production value is excellent, which is to be expected given the large budget spent on making this film. The big CGI hallway sequences is no faker than The Matrix Revolution in late 2003, the female vampires are a bit awkward through my polished 2017 glasses, but other than that, the technical department have done their jobs superbly. There really isn't much that haven't been said about why the film's bad, on the other hand. The 'horror' aspect consist of only jump scares and very little else, and even Jackman's title character, the only one in the story not terribly underwritten, seems to lack in any kind of flavor so even Dr. Van Helsing becomes a bland and generic hero, one without an origin sub-plot or even a character arc. Where is the crisis for him, what is at stake here on the most personal level? The end of the world if Dracula is not stopped? I'm sorry but that's not good enough. Even the romance subplot feels forced.(Not to mention this film started Jackman's unfortunate ""holding my dead love interest in my arms while howling and sobbing in great pain, and doing all this topless"" roles which was repeated 2 years later in X Men: The Last Stand.)Ironically, Alan Silvestri's soundtrack proved to have enjoyed a far better shelf life than the film itself. Song's from the score was used all over TV, includin multiple times during the peak years of the world's most popular car show, Top Gear. Hearing the Van Helsing soundtrack while watching super cars race through southern Europe is pretty funny.I agree with the 5-7 star reviews saying Van Helsing is great, mindless silly fun, I do. When the title Universal logo turns black and white and morphs into a burning torch, I was epically excited in my seat, expecting a truly scary film with a grander story than the Mummy films. Needless to say, I was immensely disappointed. I don't give out 8-10 scores easily, and 5-7 is my usual mark for a passable product, hence the score of 4 here, indicating disappointment.",Van Helsing
460,moninm,"A lot of fun, but wouldn't pay to see it",4,28 October 2019,"I love movies like this, but yikes, it had waaaaay too long of a run time. The inclusion of werewolves, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Frankensteins's monster, and Dracula himself made this the perfect inclusion to a list of spooky movies to see near Halloween. I had seen it many years ago on TV when I was a child and I loved it, although now I think that some of it was a bit boring and gross, especially Dracula's offspring. The addition of Carl as comedic relief was a bit unnecessary. If anything I would have like his character more if he were more intelligent and scientific. Also the ways that certain characters met their end didn't really make sense due to what they walked away from previously. Those complaints aside however, Hugh Jackman's performance was well done, the adventure and mystery of the story was intriguing, and the ghouls and monsters of frightful classics are always fun to see on the big screen.",Van Helsing
461,COB-3,Where's the story ?,4,16 May 2004,"I went in search of a good movie and came away with something a good deal less. Be assured, the sequel will not show up as every famed monster that Hollywood has ever exploited is already dead by the end of this one. It boasts a cast of fine actors but Stephen Sommers seems to overlook the fact that special effects must support and add to a good story, otherwise it's a video game. In The Mummy the ineptitude of most of the main characters along with a tongue in cheek script carried the day. Here Gabe Van Helsing is a serious man in search of serious things and vampires appear out of the woodwork at the throw of a switch. It's as if they were hired out at great cost and had to be used to justify the great expense. In the end we grow weary of the scrapes that our hero and heroine get in and out of. The only thing to offset the gung ho heroes is the comic touch of David Wenham ( formerly seen as Faramir) as an inept sidekick. It could all have been so much better.",Van Helsing
462,bluestylus,Most annoying performance,2,27 December 2005,"Okay, so I gave one grade point for special effects. Otherwise, this movie is best left for teenagers with raging hormones, no girl-friend, and a dark closet. The most annoying performance (from accent to flounce) of all time in Hollywood goes to Kate Beckinsale for her hideous performance as Anna. If I had seen this movie in the theatre, I would have sued for damages. It would appear the true monster in this film is Beckinsale. I don't know what other movies she's been in, so I cannot comment on her overall worth as an actor, but based alone on this performance, I'd say she should be paid in toilet paper because her talent is non-existent and/or crap at best.",Van Helsing
463,bsl05,"Entertaining, but homage or rip-off?",7,13 May 2004,"Van Helsing was a decently entertaining movie.  It does not start off too well, but improves once the action picks up a little bit.  It does seem to use parts of other movies, but not necessarily monster movies as you would expect.  I definitely noticed scene or line similarities with LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring, The Fifth Element, and The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly among others.  This is not a good thing.  It's OK to pay homage to classic movies of the same genre, but to take from a spectrum of different ones does not help a movie.A lot of eye-rolling scenes, but entertaining enough. 7/10",Van Helsing
464,aziffle13,Very flawed it is $1.00 rental for fans of the genre,6,5 April 2005,"Wow, what can I say? Let's start with for me a 6 is a very mediocre rating. It has a great look and it was a great idea and that is where great and this film part company.Hugh Jackman is fine as the title character as is most of the cast the notable exception being Richard Roxburgh as Dracula who brings back memories (okay nightmares) of Jeremy Irons in Dungeons and Dragons. He takes overact in places to an extreme level and never strikes you as anything other than a caricature. The effects are over done and in some cases really really bad. Apparently, nobody associated with this picture has any idea of the capabilities or limits of the human body. People are thrown through walls, bounce off trees, and undergo huge falls all seemingly with little or no ill effects. I have no problem suspending disbelief to an extent, but man you can only disobey the laws of physics so many times without me losing interest.The story carries itself for awhile, but falls apart about half way through and the movie ends up being a series special effects. The abilities of the vampires seems to vary from moving at nearly the speed of thought to merely near human speed when it comes time to kill them. The Frankenstein monster has a great look, there is also a neat take on Mr. Hyde, the werewolves are fine (over done transformation scenes), and the vampires look cool (expectations being Dracula's fine battle visage and the unhinging 'Predator' jaws when they go to feed at times).I wasn't much of a fan of the ending either.My recommendation if you are a fan of the genre rent it for a $1.00 otherwise pass. It certainly is not the quality and doesn't have any of the mass appeal of ""The Mummy"" or ""The Mummy Returns"".",Van Helsing
465,kurosawa-1,Just okay,6,19 February 2006,"Van Helsing is okay, nothing special. Van Helsing has two main problems, the first of which concerns the cliché and vastly uninteresting characters. We have seem these types before - the strong, action orientated heroin who eventually gives into her femininity by falling in love with the hero, her equally boring male counterpart! Next time, take out a leaf from Pirates of the Caribbean's book - it was the brilliant Johnny Depp who made POC such a worldwide hit!! Why? Jack Sparrow is unique, hilarious and highly watchable. Also if you are going to stage elaborately expensive action scenes remember to turn on the lights, otherwise the audience will not be able to see what is going on and lose interest!!

Hugh Jackman was better than everybody. I wish i could see it for the third time. Hugh Jackman's acting and the movie are good that, you know, I think that the movie's a must for all Hugh Jackman fans...

467,jonann2,This film is horrible!!!,1,9 May 2004,"I didn't want to see Van Helsing in the first place, but my friends talked me into it.  I was not disappointed because I went into the film with low expectations.  My expectations proved valid.  What the makers of this film have done to the character of Van Helsing is a disgrace.  In the original Dracula novel, Professor Van Helsing is the scientist and scholar who uses his wisdom and knowledge to defeat the evil of Dracula.  Its sort of a metaphor of science's victory over superstition.The makers of the Van Helsing films have taken this character and turned him into a long haired, pretty boy vampire hunter more akin to Buffy the Vampire Slayer than the character for which he is named.  Doing this to Van Helsing would be like taking Sherlock Holmes and turning him into a Rambo like character that blasts Professor Moriarty with machine guns.  I am sick of modern movie makers taking gothic horror stories, situations, and characters, and turning them into amped-up action films.  Now, the one exception would be the Mummy, because they did do a good update to that character, a big improvement over the old bandage swathed skulking villain of yesteryear.That being said, they could have made an acceptable action based film of this sort, with the Van Helsing character.  You make Van Helsing true to what his character should be (the old, wise scientist), and team him up with a young Hugh Jackman character that is a vampire hunter.  Brains and brawn brought together to defeat the monsters.  But what they did with this film is absolutely disgraceful.The only good thing that has come out of Van Helsing's release is that Universal has re-released many of the classic horror films from the 30's and 40's to DVD as a marketing tool.  I will buy the old films on DVD.  When Van Helsing comes out on DVD, it will not be on my shopping list.",Van Helsing
468,Mattster99,A good action flick!,7,17 December 2009,"Stephen Sommers did pretty well when he made ""The Mummy"", but when I saw this, I was so happy that the film had been made, because I had been looking forward to it for a long time, just another huge monster mash, like ""The Monster Squad"" or the ""Abott and Costello"" films. This film brought together the classic Monster Movies, like ""Dracula"", ""Frakenstein"" and much more.I'm guessing some people hated this film, and thats OK, because it is their opinion and they can stick with it, I on the other hand think it had a good plot, pretty good acting, but a very good amount of suspense.Some of the Dialouge was a bit dumb, like the scene where Dracula is babbling about his life, and winging to his wives, he says (or yells) ""No, I have no Heart!"", which was really laughable.Hugh Jackman does well as the part of Van Helsing, he was a good choice for the role, Kate Beckinsale was good as Anna Valerious, one of the descendants of her Grandfather to kill Dracula, David Wenham was funny as Van Helsing's Gadget and Weapon provider Carl.The Plot was quite good and easy to follow, and it was nowhere near predictable, except the ending where Van Helsing kills Count Dracula, the usual good guy kills bad guy routine.I recommend it to all who are a fan of Action\Horror\Adventure films, or movies where they bring back classic film characters, so if you haven't seen it, go rent it, buy it, it's a fun film.",Van Helsing
469,Kingveggeta87,This movie sucks,1,13 May 2004,"The one line summary basically sums up my feelings about this film.  I went into Van Helsing hoping that it would be a great way to start off the long awaited summer movie season.  Instead, I got the ultimate peice of S*** that is not worth viewing even once. (I snuck out and went to see some of Kill Bill at one point.)One way to describe Van Helsing is that it is lke a Johnny Depp movie, the only reason you might want to see it is because of Depp's prescence. In this case, that honor goes to leading man Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman.  he does a pretty good job playing the average demon hunter.  Other than that, well, the film is basically an accident waiting to happen.Terrible acting and sub-par effects don't come close to the amount of familiar scenery and concepts that I have seen in other films.  If you've seen Blade, Blade II, Mortal Kombat 2 and The Lord of the Rings 3, you've seen alot of Van Helsing before.In short, this flick should be shipped directly to video & DVD and used for target practice.

This movie has campiness on a level with Big Trouble in Little China or Army of Darkness.  People can make fun of the ridiculous action sequences, the illogical storyline, the terrible acting, the obnoxious accents, and the stupid hats all they want.  The fact is this movie only has two big problems.1.  The special effects are too good2.  Bruce Campbell should have played Gabriel Van Helsing.",Van Helsing

I was half right.To help bring myself down to ""Van Helsing""'s level--you know, to get into a less critical, fun-anticipating mood--I had three martinis before entering the theater. It wasn't enough.I've seen better F/X in Ed Wood films. Abbott and Costello met scarier monsters. Video games have more engaging (and credible) plots. The jokes were painful; the drama riotous. Whatsername was hilarious as her accent ranged from Natasha Fatale to a German Scot. If the movie had been tongue-in-cheek (e.g. ""The Night Stalker"" or ""Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things""), it might possibly have succeeded.It's hard to believe, with the time-tested material they had to work with, that they could possibly have failed to make an entertaining movie.

A waste of talent (the suave Hugh Jackman and beautiful Kate Beckinsale have hit bottom.) And finally, a waste of time (nearly two and a half hours of total boredom.) There was a cool concept to be found somewhere in this mess, admittedly. Universal Pictures has a stock of classic monsters, and have brought them together for one adventure by re-inventing Dracula's nemesis Van Helsing as a sort of 19th century ghost buster. This project must have been doomed from script stage, though, because that's when Universal handed everything over to writer/director Stephen Sommers, the genius behind those two silly MUMMY re-makes. Sommers rapes and plunders great monster movies, making Dracula, Wolfman, and Frankenstein's monster unrecognizable CGI Hulks, with no regard to their actual ""history"" or ""legend"" as characters. He takes fantastic, undoubtedly expensive sets and locations, and fills them up with frantic, non-sensual stunts and action.

Obstacles along the way include a myriad of universal monster tropes. Beyond that I recommend viewing as i wont spoil the fun! The cgi may be over used to some but it is high quality and creates some truly amazing set pieces and monster transformations. Costumes are rich and quite frankly I'm surprised this hasn't garnered viewing parties a la harry potter or the Rocky Horror picture show. This movie truly feels like an adventure with fleshed out backstories before the main theme ensues. A perfect one and done!",Van Helsing
476,lolique,"Great on effects and photography, short on story",7,29 April 2004,"This is probably one of the most beautifully shot FX films in a long time, capturing the dark moody atmosphere of the early German impressionistic films, using some of the best background mattes seen in a long time. Unfortunately the skimpy story-line doesn't hold up for the long running time and audiences will start to get bored way before the end title. Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious are perfect in their roles. Richard Roxburgh has a wonderful time chewing-up all the scenery available as the campy Count Vladislaus Dracula and David Wenham brings comedy-relief to the side-kick part of Carl. Even though the ending will come as a surprise (and a disappointment) for most general audiences, anyhow this visually handsome film should do GREAT business in the boxoffice.",Van Helsing
477,shawnk,An excellent progression to a classic theme,9,8 March 2005,"So. How would you evolve the classic characters of 20th Century horror classics? Van Helsing has great effects, an intricate plot, and a subtle sense of tongue in cheek humor (note the villagers are still sort of the same as in the first Frankenstein movie). Add to this a Gothic style of art that borders on the visually spectacular. It all sums up to an excellent progression in the characters and myths of Hollywood monsters :-) I loved this flick. From the 'sidekick friar' (a la 'Q' in James Bond) to the complaining assistant (Igor do this, Igor do that) this film was a real pleasure.If you have a warm spot in your heart for classic horror and sci-fi you should really see this film. Its a great escape into a more modern rendition of what made the classic horror films really popular (A movie that scares you and makes you feel really good after you've seen it).With an almost innocent sense of 'humor in the macabre', Van Helsing delivers monsters that are a just scary enough and interesting enough to make them, yet again, perpetually endearing.Thanks so much to the team who made this a really fun film. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to get some popcorn and .. see it again.",Van Helsing
478,buckaroo-6,A long and boring video clip,2,1 April 2005,"Well, never mind that Van Helsing shamelessly copies elements of a couple of other movies (The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Wild Wild West are just two examples which come to my mind) - a couple of movies did so.Never mind the fact that the plot contains dozens of holes large enough to drive a whole fleet of trucks through - the same applies to a lot of other movies.Also never mind that a lot of the action scenes are completely unbelievable and way over the top - there are some movies guilty of the same.The main issues with Van Helsing is that this movie is boooooooooring. There is no climax, the pace of the movie never changes, it just stays at the same level. Consider this: when watching the movie at home, I was so bored I stopped the film occasionally,I checked my mail, had a look at a couple of websites and so on. Only sheer willpower prevented me from giving up watching the film - well, I was really hoping that this mess would soon end.So, basically Van Helsing a long and overblown video clip - full of CGI, no real story, no real climax. If you've got insomnia, VH might be a cure for you - I myself had a hard time staying awake.",Van Helsing
479,pbarnhill,Tongue firmly in cheek....,8,7 May 2004,"Van Helsing was not quite as i expected, but then neither was Kate Beckinsale's last monster-duelling exploits in the wasted opportunity that was 'Underworld'. Van Helsing fares much better, largely due to the charisma of Hugh Jackman (X-Men's 'Wolverine' as if you didn't know). The CGI is indeed fantastic, with seamless transitions from man to beast and back again, but what i wasn't expecting was the fact that the writer seems to be working from a checklist of cliches, and not just horror/sc-fi ones. Everything is thrown into the mix here, cheesy lines galore (which Jackman gives a certain tongue in cheek style to, i must admit), and enough movie homages - obvious and obscure - to keep many film fans glued for a second viewing. Overall, slightly scary, slightly camp, slightly ridiculous, but definitely a good night's entertainment. 7/10.",Van Helsing
480,chris123,"Flawed, but still loved it",9,10 May 2004,"Okay, this movie is no intelligent piece of cinema.  It's mindless entertainment, pure and simple.  The action sequences are okay, maybe a tad cliche.  The CG is decent, again not groundbreaking but not hideously bad either.  It is a movie that makes no pretense of taking itself seriously. At times, that goes so far some scenes even feel like a spoof.  There are some cringe-worthy moments, like the ending; and the vampires are sometimes so stupid that makes me wonder how they could have survived for so long... 
But for all its shortcomings, I thought the movie was great.  It's just so funny.  I laughed so much; I even applauded after one of Anna's lines near the end.  Plus, David Wenham's character Carl is absolutely hilarious; his 'Q spoofs' moments are just so totally precious.  For me, he stole the show. I had a lot of fun watching the movie, and that's enough for me to call it 'good'.  I won't mind watching it again; and I'd definitely buy the DVD when it comes out.",Van Helsing
481,allykat_d,More to it than you think.... SPOILERS ...,7,7 May 2004,"Let me say up front that I loved this movie.  I haven't had as much fun at a movie theatre in years.  This movie is pure story telling spectacle at its finest.  Total entertainment.  This, to me, is the purpose of a movie: go get lost for two hours and forget about everything else, forget about the world and get lost in a fantasy. Van Helsing did that for me.  There were tons of CG but it fit the story and never detracted from it.  However, I believe there's more to this movie, an added layer, that will pass over most viewers' heads.SPOILERS AHEAD....  although they'll make you want to go back and watch the movie again...There has been complaints/criticisms/mutterings about Van Helsing's identity.  Given the clues in the movie it's very clever what Stephen Sommers has done.The reason Van Helsing cannot remember his family and the reason he was found on the steps of the Vatican is because Van Helsing is an angel cast down from Heaven.I kid you not.Gabriel is one of the highest-ranking angels in Christian, Judaism and Mohammedan religious lore.  He is the angel of vengeance, death, and resurrection.  Gabriel is said to sit on the left-hand side of God (remember in the movie the Left Hand of God killed Dracula during the first go-round). Now here is the important part:  Gabriel is also identified as a man-God-angel and in Babylonian legend he fell into disgrace for not obeying a command exactly as given, and for that was cast down from heaven.
I think what Sommers was getting at is that the last command Gabriel disobeyed was one relating to his battle with Dracula.  For that he was cast out of heaven with no memories of who (or what) he is.Dracula recognized him as the man whom almost killed him, yet, if Gabriel was that man, he would be dead from old age.  So my theories make sense. Gabriel can't age; he's not human-at least not entirely.  I have to wonder if that explains his werewolf at the climatic scene, how he was bigger, more powerful then the others and able to resist Dracula's commands.  A battle of Titans!  The devil vs. heaven.  Although Van Helsing may be mostly mortal at this point, he still retains a spark of what he once was: The Angel of Death and Vengeance.  He is doing what he was created to do and is perhaps more effective on Earth than in Heaven.If you see the movie with this knowledge, it gives the movie an added layer above the spectacle and FX.  Watch for the clues, such as Dracula mentioning how human heartbeats increase when he is close and how Van Helsing's does not.  Listen carefully to the message of the  picture behind the wood panel. Note that Van Helsing can see Anna Valerious ascend to heaven, and that Carl (the monk played by David Wenham) can not.   Very cool.   Maybe there are more clues that I missed.I'm going to see it again and get as many people rounded up as possible to see it with me.-Allykat",Van Helsing
482,the_shadow_guard,Don't take it seriously,2,16 May 2004,"Pretty-looking movie EXTREMELY loosely based on someone's inaccurate conception of what Transylvania is like. This is one of those movies tailored to look good at the expense of the amount of realism that would be appropriate. But remember, Hungarians don't really sound like that, Dracula did not really live in the years given, and (believe it or not) Halloween is not and never was celebrated in Hungary, no matter how obligatory the holiday may seem in a ""scary"" movie. If you think Kate Beckinsale is hot, then by all means see it, but don't look if you don't want to feel embarrassed by her poor acting or accent (and, after being surrounded by real Hungarians in Underworld, she had no excuse). Enjoy.",Van Helsing
483,haoumaru,One of my fav movies! Awesome! Its just like Castlevania!,10,6 February 2005,"I have always been a big fan of the Akumajou Dracula (Castlevania) series, and since i saw the trailer of this movie I noticed there was something similar to it in Van Helsing. So I was looking forward to see it. And I did and it surpassed my expectations by far.That was one year ago, I saw it today on DVD and I enjoyed it as much as the first time. Van Helsing is an awesome movie, it has a great cast, excellent characters, locations and a wonderful storyline.Hugh Jackman was a great choice to play the main character Gabriel Van Helsing, and Kate Beckinsale did a good job as Anna Valerious. The character design of the monsters is incredible, very well done and their CG rendering is convincing and stunning. Also, the non-CG characters, such as Frankenstein's monster, look stunning too. The Werewolf, is awesome, it's just as I imagine them, incredibly real-life looking and incredibly savage.The locations are very pleasant to see, and they add a very nice touch of eeriness to the movie. Everything in it, from the start is top notch and though the movie is set in the 19th century, it has an excellent middle ages atmosphere, with strange frightened people everywhere, many religious references,prayers in Latin, catholic paraphernalia and themes, the oppressive clergymen from the Vatican and dark Gothic art. In two words, simply wonderful.I have noticed some people says they didn't enjoy the movie and didn't like it. Well, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and mine is that this movie couldn't be better. A truly masterpiece, and I am not a guy that is into horror, gore, vampire, or Goth movies. I liked it very much because it is a great movie in all senses, and it did a wonderful job with each of the classic monsters we know and love: Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, the Werewolf, etc.This is just a short review I will make for now, I will soon add more of my thoughts about this incredible motion picture. Flawless, awesome, and fantastic. My favorite movie. This is the closest you can get to see the manga/anime world of Castlevania brought to life.Simply perfect. 100 out of 100.",Van Helsing
484,bernd_hohmann,A CGI fest,4,20 May 2004,"The story itself is OK but is comparable to ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" - many plots of many authors of the 18th century are mixed together.Unfortunately ""van Helsing"" uses an overdose of computer generated effects to create bridges from one scene to another.Worth to see (for the effects and smooth incoperation of the real live scenes) but not worth to remember.At least for me as an European, where the stories about Frankensteins Monster, Dracula and other stories mentioned in this film are well known.",Van Helsing
485,Kallithrix,Should have been called 'Tarzan of Transylvania',5,5 March 2005,"There wasn't a lot to like about Van Helsing. It was a camp rehash of old fashioned horror movies, which worked for the Mummy because it had snappy dialogue, a cohesive and character based plot, and good acting. Unfortunately Van Helsing lacked all these things.The dialogue was pedestrian and mundane at best, horribly clichéd at worst, the plot was also rather monotonous and lacked any focus, and the characters lacked heart (no pun intended- most of the baddies did eventually get stakes through theirs). Even the impressive special effects packed action sequences began to get a little dull and repetitive, as every time the good guys got into a tricky situation they always had some handy rope, creeper or electric cable nearby to swing themselves to safety. After a while I thought I was watching a film about Tarzan! Hugh Jackman was wooden and soulless, Kate Beckinsale was the most unconvincing action heroine I have ever seen, surpassed in ridiculousness only by her Romanian Gypsy accent, and the brides... well, I would rather forget about their hammy, screechy overacting altogether. Two small redeeming factors were Richard Roxburgh and David Wenham, both of whom performed their parts with enough aplomb to carry them off, while at the same seemingly conscious of how silly they are being, whereas Jackman and Beckinsale take themselves altogether too seriously.I wouldn't sit through this mish-mash of a story again, so it definitely doesn't have the same kind of repeat playability as Sommers' Mummy films. I had hoped for something of the same calibre from such a good director of comedy action adventure romps, but I was disappointed.",Van Helsing

It is some of the worst stuff ive seen, comepletely takes me off the mood to see hugh jackman clearly walking on a green screen. What brings me back in? The film doesnt care. And its proud of itself. My god! So damn proud its adorable.Not only that, but the film doesnt take itself seriously at all!! It takes tropes and characters and creates this mish mash that is both generic and yet full of passion and excitement. The main villain is camp incarnate, he gives such a delisiously entertaining ridiculous evil he stole the scene everytime. It just has personality, behind the 2000's aesthetic, generic plot youve seen a hundred times, and cgi that look like playstation 2 graphics, is a soul that just wants u to have fun. Im glad to have given this one a second chance.",Van Helsing
487,jonothanwarriorpoet,And I wanted to like this movie so bad...,5,14 May 2004,"Alright, well to be completely fair, I walked into this movie pumped.  I had been looking forward to it since I first read the rumors.  Hugh Jackman is great and Beckinsale isn't too bad either, but they just couldn't pull this movie out of the rutt.  The movie got into this early pattern of dropping people from the top of things and just didn't seem to be able to stop.  I can't remember the last time falling was a chief plot device in a movie! Anyway, we are grounded in a certain love for the classic horror creatures (Drac, Frank, Wolfie) and to cheer against them we need to be given a certain motivation, i.e. connection to the hero who battles them.  Van Helsing just doesn't offer that.  I didn't care what happened to either of the heroes in the movie, no matter how many times they fell off of things. Thrills were not delivered, special effects were only semi-impressive while not realistic, and they played on the same old monster mashing traditions. Beckinsale seems strangely doomed to make Underworld over and over as it seems this was another werewolf versus vampire movie.  Weak plot, weak characters, weak movie, little or no originality.  Luckily, the constant action is just enough to keep you from realizing what the movie is till it's over.  In the end, it really feels like an episode of a Van Helsing cartoon than anything else. 5/10",Van Helsing
488,mrswhite072895,A solid and fun monster hunting movie to usher in the summer season,6,12 May 2004,"I did myself a great disservice by reading many of the negative newspaper reviews of the movie Van Helsing, because I couldn't watch the first twenty minutes without noticing the supposed flaws of the flick. However, that passed and I was able to enjoy the 2 hour-10 minute film (2 hours and 23 minutes if you can't the end credits). Let me say that the critics are being unnecessarily harsh on Stephen Sommers and Van Helsing. It is not an Oscar-worthy that will be remembered by the AFI thirty years from now, but it is a film that will take you out mind.The plot is a very simple, but not so simple as to offend your intellect. Hugh Jackman (of the X-men movies and the Tony-nominated musical ""The Boy from Oz"") plays Gabriel Van Helsing, a monster hunter for a secret sect of the Catholic Church. From what we see of the sect's headquarters, it isn't only the Catholics who are employing Van Helsing to save the souls of those possessed by evil. It is in these secret headquarters hidden in the Vatican City that the audience learns that the Church rescued a broken and amnesiac Van Helsing several years ago, and it is through his monster hunting/soul saving that he will recall his forgotten past. (POSSIBLE SPOLIER HERE!) We also learn here that his past goes as far back as 800 years from the present 1888 of the movie. Van Helsing is then sent to Romania to help a gypsy princess, played with butt-kicking and back-flipping furor by Kate Beckinsale, defeat Count Dracula. Kate Beckinsale's Anna Valerious is the last one in the family who is cursed to eternal damnation unless Count Dracula is killed by them. Dracula and his three vampire brides have it out for the Valerious clan, and the reason why is a surprise. During their mission to find and destroy Dracula, as well as his undead children that he is trying to bring to life with the help of Dr. Frankenstein's technology, Anna and Van Helsing fight vampires, the werewolf, an angry crowd, and Frankenstein's monster before befriending him.Like ""The Mummy,"" director Stephen Sommers does not allow his heroes to have a healthy fear of their enemies. They have too much of a jaded, 21st Century attitude. If the characters aren't even a bit afraid, how is the audience supposed have a suspension of disbelief? Aside from this flaw and the obvious set up for sequel through several of Dracula's allusions to Van Helsing's past, this is a solid and fun summer movie. It is to his credit, that Sommers doesn't make the movie as serious or as dark as other vampire films of recent history (like ""Interview with the Vampire,"" ""Bram Stokers' Dracula,"" and ""Underworld""). Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale play the swashbuckling roles with the right balance, and Shuler Hensley's Frankenstein's monster gives the movie a soul. In helping to keep the film light, Richard Roxburgh does an excellent job of camping up Dracula but not to the point where he can't be perceived as a formidable foe. The movie is not as overblown, bloated, or as weighed down by special effects as the critics would have you believe. Aside from the CGI that makes the simplest human movement appear as supernatural and too perfect, the movie makes good use of its stunts and F/X budget. This movie is a way to usher in the lazy, hazy days of summer. Just pray they don't do a sequel.",Van Helsing
489,psmcdoug,Oh so bad!!!,2,19 November 2004,"I have to admit I'm not the biggest action movie/monster movie fan, so my viewpoint is clearly jaded. We rented this movie and only made it through about half of it before we could take no more and turned it off. Come on, even in comic book movies you still need to have at least mediocre acting from the humans playing the roles! The lead woman role was simply atrocious. I found the action sequences to be run of the mill and ridiculous... it's hard to feel concern for a lead character when he appears to be invincible or unharmable from virtually the movie's start. I'm just glad we didn't pay movie theater prices for this work of garbage!",Van Helsing
490,KryptoniteCornCob,"Like 'Nighmare Creatures', only crappy. - SPOILERS",1,19 November 2004,"The advertising/marketing of this movie is what eventually reeled me in to finally rent this movie on DVD. The movie looked like it would be slick enough, and have some cool monster action, reminding me a lot of the video game 'Nightmare Creatures'. The difference is is that Nightmare creatures is good. But anyway, wow, after seeing this movie, i see that Hollywood never ceases to keep getting cheesier and cheesier. They have reached a new low in all areas, especially in the form of writing horrible scripts, and the (horrible) use of CGI. I simply cannot put into words how atrocious the cgi in this movie is. It is so bad that it ruined the entire movie for me. One of the most laughable effects would have to be Frankenstein's monsters' brain, which glows like one of those static balls you can buy in almost any store (the kind you can put your finger on and the static follows it). I can't believe they used CGI for that, i could've bought a static ball, stuffed it into the back of a prosthetic head and achieved a better result. All of the cgi is just horrible, all of the monsters were laughable except for Frankenstein's monster, he was overall kinda cool because he was not CGI and his acting was decent. I hate CGI, but not for what it is, but how Hollywood uses it. They simply do not know what they are doing. The creatures in this movie would have benefited greatly from being physically built. There is never a 'scary' or tense moment in this because of the Scooby Doo movie CGI looking creatures. The flying creatures might as well have been tossing Scooby snacks to the villagers below them. I've seen plenty of bad movies, but this one is bad all around. Bad acting (mostly), HORRIBLE special effects, crappy script, and the movie is way too long for what it is. It tries it's best to be 'epic', but fails miserably. I have nothing against long movies, as long as they are actually good. This one would have been better off shorter. Fortunately, i wasn't unlucky enough to have seen this in the theater. However a friend of mine has and now i too feel his pain. I'm tired of having my intelligence insulted by going to the theater and always seeing garbage movies. I hear people comment about movies such as this as being 'fun' movies and not to expect much. Well, i am the consumer and i sure as Helsing should be getting more for my money than this crap. And the reason Hollywood keeps churning out this crap is because millions of people keep allowing it by giving them money.If people would boycott theaters for awhile, Hollywood would try harder. I wanted to like Van Helsing, but, i simply really cannot. I'm kinda depressed now after seeing this heap. But i should've known better, in the days of almost always crappy CGI, and Hollywood being so unoriginal that they actually have to remake movies. In closing, Van Helsing is one of the worst movies i have seen in a while, and it's right up there with Wendigo and House of the dead. So, unless you enjoy video game(borderline cartoon) graphics as the main attraction in movies, glowing static ball monster of frankenstein brains, stay away from this. If you want some cool monster hunting action, play Nightmare Creatures instead. Hollywood, you need to at least try to polish your turds a little more..because the corn is still showing.

492,alex_imdb,A pleasant surprise if your expectations weren't high,6,22 December 2004,"I was looking forward to watch Van Helsing, probably because there was not much going on around or probably just to keep up to date. I had little expectations about it, the synopsis didn't attract me much, but I wanted something new, so I watched it.I was pleasantly surprised that the opening scene wasn't introducing the main character, and that the author managed to keep the intrigue during the next couple of scenes (c'mon, it isn't something written by the Cohen brothers or Kaufmann, so let's treat it in its weight category!). Of course, I had to filter a fair amount of BS, but that's normal for a heroic flick like that, so bring it on.The CGI was pretty good, sometimes very good, sometimes annoying - up to the standards in any case, though no matrixish bullet time or whatever. But what for? There's already lots of movies with splashing water circled all around by the virtual camera, just pick a title from the shelf.The plot, as I've already said, isn't worth mentioning. The salad the Mummy's daddy Stephen Sommers has done out of seemingly all the monster fiction and comic books found on his shelf looks like an unsuccessful marriage of Mary Shelley's mattress dwelling bedbug and Ian Flemming's bastard nephew's chihuahua's flee. And I could probably live much better without the hero/sidekick vs villain/sidekick cliché, but then it would take the author to actually think a lot, so hey, gimme the action, babe and nevermind the self-proclaimed intellectuals! If you have a weak stomach - try not to watch this movie after meal. Some parts are really gross stomach-wise, lots of viscous blob being splattered and lots of squishy looking things jumping around. Yuck.All in all, I enjoyed the movie, it made my evening, so if you don't get tired easily of meaningless plots, can filter BS at some fair ratio and like to watch an action-packed movie with a sometimes creative camera work - go for it.

Something to refresh your mind when you've watched too many deep minded movies. You don't have to over-think Van Helsing and that's what makes it a good movie to watch.

It is a shame there wasn't a significant spark between the leads (personally I didn't think this was a requirement though really) but the expected minor roles (Igor, the Friar sidekick, the Undertaker and especially the brilliantly CGI'd Dracula's Brides) more than made up for any minor let downs by the leads.Basically if you liked the Mummy (especially if you liked the Mummy Returns too ... ie you could ignore the rather bad CGI at the end!) then chances are very high you'll like this too.Oh, and to the person who said nobody with an IQ above 50 could enjoy this movie, the three of us in my party all thoroughly enjoyed it and all IQs were over 125 :)",Van Helsing

I figure you can either live with it or stop expecting things you know you aren't going to get.  When I go to a movie I want to be entertained.  Van Helsing entertained me for two hours.

Why did they bother hiring decent actors for this slop when they could have made the same film (with even more crap special effects) without wasting the talents of people who could (and yet didn't) act?So don't watch this for a plot or even just an adventure story. Watch it because you like the actors, though a couple of the performances are wince worthy, or because you like special effects.If I had paid for the movie ticket, I would want my money back.

""Van Helsing"", the movie, was shallow, hard to follow due to the director insisting on relying on special effects that were often times too fast, and lame with its attempts at humor. My only hope is that this movie, the first shot by a movie company in the upcoming summer barrage, is not an indicator of things to come. This movie was so bad I wouldn't even consider it for a rental.",Van Helsing

Theywere witty, funny, and didn't take themselves all that seriously...Van Helsing on the other hand, isn't witty, isn't funny, and has anending that seems to indicate that the movie is serious... only itisn't at all up to that point.I'd also like to make a comment about Computer Generated FX inmovies today.  More does NOT equal better!  Case in point: thismovie!  Just because you can put it on screen doesn't mean youshould!  If you were to ask me, I would say that the peak inphotorealistic CGI was probably back in the mid-90's because theFX were only used where they had to be.  Now we get treated to theFrankenstein monster swinging around like Tarzan over anendless cavern in front of Dracula's castle in the midst of athunderstorm.  Too much!  It's time to show some restraint...",Van Helsing
502,Gryosphere,The Classic Creatures are Reborn in this Action-Packed Adventure!,10,7 May 2004,"If you like Action-Packed Summer movies that get you excited, then Van Helsing is for you. Also, if you are a fan of Steven Sommers's The Mummy and The Mummy Returns this is defenitley for you. While I would still rather The Mummy, this is ten times better then The Mummy Returns.Don't listen to what the critics are saying about this movie, they obviously do not know how to have a good time at the movies. I just have to say, that if you inititally wanted to see it but are afraid to see it now because of the critics, still go see it.SPOILERS!
The Opening sequence, which was in black and white, is a great tribute to the ending of the 1941 Frankenstien movie. The villager's with the picthforks and the burning on the windmill, really got me excited to see how they incorporated the orignal Frankenstien movie.The best scene in the movie is the final battle between Dracula and Van Helsing(who at this point is a Wolf Man). Richard Roxburgh does a terrific job as Count Vladislaus Dracula.
End of SPOILERS!
The only problem I had with this movie(all movies have there problems even the very best movies), was the length. I do think it was probably 15-20 minutes to long. Other then that, this is going to be a Summer movie that will be very hard to top. Go see this movie, and I think you will be plesentley surprised.",Van Helsing
503,dickbub@hotmail.com,This movie is really a piece of art,2,9 May 2004,"This movie is really a piece of art! On Saturday I have seen David Lynch's Blue Velvet for the first time. It was quite hard to digest and I had wonderful nightmares during the night because of the morbid atmosphere he establishes in his movies. I thought that these nightmares were a good inspiration to got to see Van Helsing the next day. And so I took a friend and we went to witness this `unique' experience.
Some reviewers wrote quiet funny things. One said that the acting couldn't have been worse if there were sock puppets instead of real actors. One said, that the movie is as if someone wrote a LETTER ONLY WITH BIG LETTERS and another wrote that this movie is the king of all the cliché overloaded Hollywood blockbusters of recent years. And guess what?  They are all damn right! From start to finish it is one big abuse of clichés. It is as if someone took every single cliché that was used in every single Jerry Bruckheimer production and threw in into one big hat, then stirred a little bit and made a film in the exact order of the items he draw. In fact the amount of clichés used in this movie is nothing less but ART. I have never seen something equal in my whole life and I've seen plenty of films.
By the end of the film when my brain was transformed into a box of limp biscuits and my buttocks were swollen to the size of blimp (yes, the movie lasted for nearly two and a half hours and I could not sit still for only one minute because I squirmed like an brain amputated eel by trying to not to perceive any bit of the corny dialogue) I couldn't stop laughing. I had to laugh about the acting, I had to laugh about the cheesy looking GCI and I had to laugh because it was a greater nightmare to watch this film and for that to have wasted more than two hours of my life, than the nightmare I had the night before after watching Blue Velvet. So I begun to think about what could have made to movie even worse and at least I did find out what.
Sommers could have given an employment to Orlando Bloom with his excessive abuse of just one single facial expression. An expression as if something heavy had fallen on his big toe and he's now waiting until the pain reaches his brain to process. His expression would have fit beautifully to the one single, tremendously long, monotonous fighting scene from the start to the finish of this travesty. I cannot give this flick any ratings because otherwise I would have to buy the Imdb homepage and allow to rate negatively. Then I gave a -6 but since this is too extravagant I give you the advice to take a bath in a pool full of blood-hungry piranhas instead of wasting time, money and wits with thisya know.thing!",Van Helsing
504,iDontSleep-iDream,So Bad It's Good,3,8 July 2007,"I often watch this movie when I need a picker-up. It's just one of those movies that, no matter how hard you try, you cannot manage to take seriously. Whether you're a fan of action, adventure or romance, this movie creates a monster of each genre. It's what directors create when they have too much budget and not enough plot and it's why people say Hollywood is going to the dogs (wolfmen).Action-wise, most of it is computer animated. And it's not half-bad, but that means it's only really half-good. It's just computerized enough that you can tell it's computerized. Any action that's not computerized... Well, I obviously don't remember it, so...Adventure films assume a sound plot, which Van Helsing cannot seem to deliver. It's like they took every single legendary monster they could find and shoved them all into one movie. My friends and I check often for guest appearances of The Mummy, but we guessed that the director already got that out of his system. Basically, the plot can't hold up against any critic and most of the time, like when you find out about wolfmen, the movie just leaves you with a 'huh?' and not plausible explanation. The romance is forced, without much lead-up. Basically, you know it's coming, because you know it HAS to be coming. The main characters hook up because they HAVE to hook up. It's just that kind of movie. And although the chemistry isn't awful, IE, they don't physically repel each other, it's not great, either. The only point that this movie really sources is comedy, and not for the non-wise-cracking sidekick, either. (My friends and I were so disappointed after realizing that the typical sidekick wasn't even funny. THAT was the worst part). The true comic genius goes unappreciated, though, as, in the Simpson and countless other spoofs, there is a Mufasa reference. Okay, it's not a reference, but heck, it should be. So there it is. This movie is funny if you like bad movies, but go into it assuming it's a true action/adventure and you'll be sorely disappointed. I love this movie, and suggest you watch it for a laugh, which is sad because I do love Hugh Jackson. Hopefully, he has better things on his horizon that souped-up monster movies.",Van Helsing
505,movieguyangelus,Bad beyond belief,1,8 May 2004,"I have never been a fan of big budget summer blockbusters, but at least a few of them were mindless, fun popcorn movies. I had a reasonable hope that Van Helsing would at least be watchable. After five minutes I knew that it would be a struggle to sit through. Where do I begin? The lousy looking CGI? The terrible plot? The lame script? How about the acting which could not have been worse had it been performed by sock puppets. The ""actor"" who played Dracula was less frightening than the Count on Sesame Street. Hugh Jackman simply looks like he lost a bet to appear in the film...and the eye candy vampire brides have all the talent of the cast of any Girls Gone Wild DVD you can find. Aren't monsters supposed to be scary? Then someone explain the stupid looking Mr. Hyde at the begining of the movie who looks like a Shrek wannabe...Shrek is more frightening.

I will admit that it kept me entertained enough to keep me in the cinema until the end (a feat a few of the audience at my screening didn't manage) But this is purely because i like monster movies and I was sure they'd be a big wrestling battle at the end (And I Can be quite stubborn when I've paid £10).On a plus point the CGI, although overused was of a high standard. And the action, although meaningless was slightly entertaining. Unfortunatley all this means nothing when you don't give a damn about the characters.A note to Mr Stephen Sommers. Next time you get $170million dollars to spend on a movie use some of that money to develop a story, & if you've got time maybe even write a script! Youll find all the cool CGI you like is even more effective when it has a reason to be in a film.I have to congratulate the people behind the marketing of this film as they've done an incredible job selling it to the public.I was fooled into parting with my money!3/10",Van Helsing

It's either some people say the CGI or terrible or over done (make up your mind people). Or people compared it to the black and white classics, yes, they were very good movies, but Van Helsing is a completely different type of movie. You can tell by just looking at it, I can't understand how either can be compared. For the strangest reasons, you get people complaining about the logic in a movie about Vampires, Werewolves and a Frankenstein monster. Find the logic in that pile of nonsense.I've waited to see this movie ever since it was in casting phase, my expectations were very high, and I wasn't let down. I loved almost every aspect of the film, apart from the ending. **Spoiler*** The faces in the sky were just way too cheesy for even me, it really would of been a better ending if that one scene were cut out. ***End Spoiler*** I love the creativity they gave to the monsters, a person shedding there skin, and the Frankenstein monster's electricity. Though sometimes, Frakenstein's character seemed a tad bit over done, as if he were performing in a shakespearian play. That was my only beef with the movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants to have a good time at the movies.

Hugh is cool, chicks will love it, there is an opening in black and white and Sommers says he loves these characters and he basically does a homage his own way, with humour....so the film is basically an adventure comedy, more than Young Frankenstain or Mel Brook's Dracula were. These are quite restrained, artsy pictures. The VH is noisy as a tornado, blasting you & throwing you out, and it's incredibly overlong, 2h20. These guys are destroying pictures now or I don't have a sense of humour. It seems bad taste, no good sense and puke all over with CGI to fill the frame, so much you can barely take it.

Apparently it is, because Hugh Jackman has been getting lead roles in movies which he has to beat up things. Luckily we have stunt doubles that will prevent us from ever seeing Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman ever attempt to sink his long, lady like nails into Juggernaut. Even more fortunate, in Van Helsing, he just has to stand in front of a green screen and flail until he works up a sweat. In Van Helsing, the only stunt doubling he needs is in scenes where he's required to physically touch Kate Beckinsale.This movie is filled with ""heros"" and ""villains"" that would totally be demolished by the wind up Nazi in Hellboy. That's the problem with Van Helsing, the monsters are so CGI, we lose total interest in them. We can't fear the villains because they're so poorly constructed.Oh yeah, there's a script too, which you can decipher through in about the time it takes to watch the trailer.

Some of these movies had special effects, but the difference between these movies and ""Van Helsing"", is these movies had plot and acting.Too many movies rely on special effects and this one was definitely in that category.  Why does Hollywood think we want to watch a video game? Because that's what today's special effects are giving us in the movies.  Wouldn't Mr. Hyde have been more believable and frightening if they had chosen a massive actor with an evil demeanor instead of a video game looking character.  And an authentic fight scene is always more enjoyable without special effects (or at least a minimum).Within 30 minutes, I was tempted to leave and go into a different movie (wish I had!).

The time is at hands, heated blanket on, lights out, camera, action, oh my! I find this movie to be excellent mainly because my expectations were so low in the first place. So, it has transcended into a pleasant surprise! Kate Beckinsale has captured my heart once and for all with her seductive independence and quite capable acting talents. Kate is not at all overshadowed by the great Van Helsing, AKA Hugh Jackman, who I thought did a pretty good wolverine in X-Men. Shuler Hensley played a quite remarkable Frankenstein's monster, slow primitive but with a college education, Boris Karloff would be impressed. Yep, that Stephen Sommers is something else besides a talented, perhaps genius? I like the concept of sheriff of vatican city. like Robin hood but this of course is obvious. The reference scene to 007 and Q was a nice surprise and kinda cute as well as entertaining and funny. The Dr. jekyll and Mr Hyde fight sequence was seat riveting, dynamic, most impressive and well done. Only Spencer Tracy was better. I reckon I oughta mention Dracula, Richard Roxburgh. I thought he was a better Dracula than either Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise, because he stuck to the Bela Legosi format. The only difference between Roxburgh and Legosi is class.

This could have been a great campy fun horror movie along the lines of a classic Hammer film (but with really great sfx) instead we groan when Kate Beckinsale first walks into a shot, suede high heels and all. Not that I am against a sexy character or two. The brides (especially Elena Anaya) are fantastic! So much so you forgive the fact their outfits appear to somehow be as impervious as their vampiric selves. Despite a poor performance from Ms. Beckinsale I did enjoy this in an odd sort of way. The effects are so brilliant you wonder how movies like the Hulk still get made, the costumes (apart from the aforementioned Kate's) are cool in a ""I wanna be _____ for Halloween"" sorta way. The DVD extras are fun, particularly the bloopers real. The side characters all put in great performances, I want to say especially ... but they were ALL brilliant.

The people that went to see this movie and claims here that they would've ""stormed the box office and demanded the money back for the entire audience"" and request that the director should apologize in public for this movie, are idiots. This is a movie you watch if you like gung-ho action, to be suspended in disbelief by something so outré that no way in hell could this ever be real. And none of it can of course. But that's the beauty of it. This movie takes something so far out, so outrageous as this is, and turns it believable.This is a great new action-movie. Action movies were best in the 80's and since then the genre has degenerated into horrible movies featuring The Rock or clever things with cool gimics, like The Matrix and Boondock Saints. This is more true to the action legacy of movies like Indiana Jones and James Bond than even the new James Bond movies.Fun movie, but not a great movie. And there's a difference there. You can hammer this movie all you want, but that won't change that fact that it's still fun and you can enjoy yourself with this piece of excellent escapism.

527,two-cents-worth,"A Terrific, Underrated Gem",8,18 January 2014,"For more than a decade I have been reading the professional critics assessment of movies, and, compared those views to those of movie goers and my own. My conclusion, there is no rhyme nor reason to the critics reviews. Take a look at the aggregated critical assessment for this movie on RT.'A hollow creature feature that suffers from CGI overload'. Only 23% of the critics liked the movie and gave is an unenthusiastic rating of 4.2'Yet Pacific Rim, which is more overloaded with CGI and all the 'ills' of Van Helsing, gets this report:'It may sport more style than substance, but Pacific Rim is a solid modern creature feature bolstered by fantastical imagery and an irresistible sense of fun'. 72% liked the movie blessed it with with a rating of 6.7'What a load of rubbish. Moreover, this farce repeats endlessly throughout reviews by critics.This incomprehensible inconsistency has lead me to one definitive conclusion. The critics have nothing of value to contribute to my assessment of a movie.Instead, I use the comments (aggregated) by movie goers (found here on IMDb) and box office sales to provide a preliminary evaluation of a movie. This method is not always accurate, but, it is pretty good running a 75% - 85% success ratio.Now for Van Helsing. A previous reviewer tagged his comment with 'Big Dumb Fun'. In my opinion, that is a perfect three word summary. The director assembled a talented cast, wove together several story lines from the horror movies of the 1930's, added a dash of James Bond gadgetry, enriched it with some good CGI, and, with the skill of a practised storyteller, created a high enjoyable experience for you and me.It does depart from the same-old, same-old versions of the story told so many times before. If you want a movie that hews closer to the originals of the 30's, take a look at the excellent 'Bram Stocker's Dracula' (1992). However, if you are in the mood for a fun, big tub of popcorn version, this is the one for you.My only regret is that the producer decided not to follow up with a sequel.

So it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise when I found the film to be fun, entertaining and quite enjoyable overall. People here are complaining about the CGI monsters. What's the beef? This is the 21st century. What do you want? A very well done CGI Mr. Hyde (voiced by Robbie Coltrane, no less) or some guy in a ripped tuxedo baring his teeth a la Spencer Tracy? Fire up those computers and bring on the CGI! Actually I found the CGI effects quite good for the most part. You want bad CGI, then check out James Bond surfing down a glacier in Die Another Day.So I'll join the minority and say that Van Helsing is well worth watching. Jackman is fine as always and the rest of the cast holds their own. The plot is just fine as well. This is a monster movie, not The Usual Suspects.Pop yourself a big bowl of popcorn, sit back and enjoy the ride.",Van Helsing
529,thedevilyouknow00,Use of Icons does not Imply Homage,1,8 May 2004,"The first indication of trouble was the fact that this movie was not in anamorphic widescreen (Cinemascope), but rather 1.85:1 ratio- all the better for its afterlife in Home Video, I suppose. By not going with a Scope, the film has already told me it lacks ambition and for something that is going to use vampires, and werewolves and other monsters, you NEED ambition. Already, this movie is in trouble and I have not seen a single frame.  But that didn't take long.  Because it commits its first cardinal sin with the character of Dracula.Dracula is an icon. He's smooth, attractive, mystery hiding untold malevolence under that seductive and dangerous exterior. He speaks very little in his movies because he doesn't have to- his eyes and facial structure do that. A quick look at Bela Lugosi, Chris Lee, or Gary Oldman communicates the visual power of Dracula.  Dracula as portrayed by Richard Roxburgh is a z-grade villain and conjures NONE of the power or allure of the Draculas of old.  He's a meglomaniacal twit that wouldn't be out of place in a Die Hard rip-off. Visually, he wears black, and not in such a w ay that shocks you or gets your eyes open, but it's a formless black suit that seems far too grounded in reality to be frightening. And he talks too much, which wouldn't be a problem but what he says is bad. Worse than Prequel bad. The force that's going to drive this film is hobbled, fatally so with a hideous visual. And Dracula never drinks blood in this film. How can you have a Dracula that doesn't drink blood?  It's one of his stock terrors- people fear Dracula because he'll drink their blood!  I can't be afraid of something that isn't going to be scary! But the movie soon works its way into other sins. We have a Mr. Hyde that has some of the worse CGI in recent memory, worse than... Oh take your pick. And then we get into the logic flaws: like taking a boat to Transylvania, a LANDLOCKED region!!! Where we met the inhabitants of a village. That, by their own admission, serves as cattle for Dracula and his brides.  I say cattle because they do nothing but run in terror like cow- whereas humans would look for places to hide. Where they might not get say... eaten by these flying 'Brides of Dracula.' Who are ugly. In a multi-million dollar picture, I want hot babes. They're recruiting in LA, I know there is no shortage of babes in LA so when you can't get hot babes for a big picture like this, the movie is SCREWED. Of course, I paid to experience this... including the acting. Which is godawful. Hugh Jackman has displayed more than a modicum of talent in the past, which is evident nowhere in this film. He maintains the same bad accent and hammy tone for the whole picture. And who did his hair? While long flowing locks may look great on the covers of romance novels, but this 1980s-reject style is woefully out of place. Kate Beckinsale has a great ass however, and it is wonderful to watch it. Far better than looking at her perpetually constipated facial expression.  Some people think she's emoting pain of... whatever. By the time I've seen her face for the tenth time or so, I'm bored and thinking of happier things. Like car wrecks. Or plane crashes. And a final condemnation. I'm not sure if this was put in to pander to the Born-agains, but what the hell is a Christianity element doing here? Jackman crosses himself many a time and Beckinsale at one point says, 'God help us.' Only, this isn't a display of the faith of characters questioning or seeking solace, its just words and motions thrown out there to try and get the audience to imagine that these characters really have come to a point of desperation. Virtual faith if you will, all the elements are there but it's essentially empty of meaning. The whole film is empty, there's lots of stuff in it to try and invoke fond memories but it fails. The filmmakers don't give any of elements any meaning or weight. Everything in this movie is a pointless tool to sell toys and games and...junk. There's no love for our memories of these characters or the meanings they've accumulated over the decades. There's just exploitation of the meanings that the elements of Van Helsing should convey, but don't thanks to incompetent filmmaking.",Van Helsing
530,De_Priester,"Cheese overkill, bad storyline, but still funny...",3,5 May 2004,"This is my first comment on a movie, I just saw it 30 minutes ago and I find it to be a mockery to a lot of classic stories. The movie was ok to watch it had some great action even if there was a bit to much cgi for my taste BUT they obviously had no clue what to do with the storyline. The movie itself is more a cheesy action comedy yet they try to make a serious story, these two made it somewhat horrible to watch. Vampires with expanding faces, Werewolves able to climb a cealing without making a noise, And Frankenstein's monster with glow in the dark items.It's a nice movie to see and trust me it's not the most horrible one I have ever seen, but people hoping for a movie with Van Helsing, vampires that actually strike some fear and excitement based on what you don't get to see instead of very cheesy cgi effects then please don't see this one, trust me you won't miss it.I gave it a 3",Van Helsing
531,Minkymouse,"I've seen worse, but it was pretty bad",5,11 May 2004,"This was not the worst film I have ever seen, but I don't think I could sit through it a second time. It was asthetically pleasing most of the way through, the sets and costumes were all very beautiful, as were most of the cast, and of course the special effects were pretty good, but that's about all I can say that was good. It was badly written and badly directed. There was a loose plot but it seemed to have been written with the plan of linking together a bunch of pretty sets and some classic monsters. However, the monsters would have been better left un-linked because it made a mockery of all 3 of them. It was completely implausible throughout and I was completely disappointed. Bring back Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee - Hammer rule.",Van Helsing
532,glennrparker,Classic horror fiction as pop art,5,16 May 2004,"Let's start with the good. Kate Beckinsale looks and sounds great. OK the accent is pretty corny, but we are in Universal horror territory here. The Dracula Brides are also beautiful and well used, but then it would be difficult to screw up these characters. Shame Josie Maran has less screen time than her counterparts, but she makes the most of her appearances. There is a nice return to traditional werewolf folklore in the transformation sequences, not quite ""Company of Wolves"" but you get the idea. Similarly, the Frankenstein's Monster is well portrayed, harking back to his literary character. The film's period detail and costumes are well thought out. But there were few things which annoyed me a little. Stephen Sommers does love his CGI. We're not quite into ""The Mummy Returns"" migraine inducing levels, but certainly getting there. Wolfmen just don't look great as cartoons. I also appreciate that it must be difficult to think up an original concept for Dracula, and Richard Roxburgh's gypsy king is brave stab at this, but sadly it just doesn't work. He just looks wrong. Hugh Jackman's Gabriel Van Helsing is an interesting character, but it would have been nice to hear more of his backstory (perhaps a mention of Abraham?). Having Jackman play another character suffering from historical amnesia is just lazy. But the story moves along at a brisk pace and is very atmospheric. If you loved Sommers' Mummy movies, I'm sure you'll enjoy this, but I think vampire purists should perhaps stay away. You'll only get upset! Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a fun, if unsubstantial, ride.",Van Helsing
533,clumzy,"Halloween Monsters, Wild Wild West and 007",6,27 September 2004,"clumzy's Take on ""Van Helsing"" - Rating - Maybe Worth a Free ViewingI like to think of myself as a manly guy. I lift weights, do the maintenance on my own car, I've built a deck, and most importantly I like guy movies. You know the ones I'm talking about: Terminator, Predator, The Matrix, and the original Star Wars Trilogy to name but a few. A good movie to me is a simple mix of interesting characters, a story that gets you caring about them and maybe a helicopter, a car chase and some wire-fu but whatever, I'm no screen writer. So you would think that taking the classic monsters of yore like the Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein and mixing in a hard-nosed ""James Bond""-ish monster hunter and a leggy corseted butt-kicking babe would make for a delightful recipe for a slob like me. Yup, unfortunately, not so much so.Set in the late 1800's the enigmatic Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a ""secret agent"" of sorts who's sole purpose is the hunting and killing of evil monsters. His exploits take him and his friar sidekick (David Wenham) to Transylvania to knock off the dreaded Count Dracula and save the sexy warrior princess Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) et al from eternal damnation. Van Helsing is armed to the teeth with an impressive array of medieval weaponry including a crossbow machine gun, some sort of spinny cutting disc saws and a couple of revolvers which make for some John Woo-ish slow-mo jumping shooting scenes. Oh ya and there's a bunch of CG Halloween monsters running and flying around in the dreary, dark, and gloomy Transylvania sets.Sounds pretty good so far doesn't it? Unfortunately this film has no magic, no charm, no style and wholly improbable action sequences. Jackman, although slightly more amiable than his role in Xmen plays his tough-guy shtick cardboard cutout of a character leaping, flipping, shooting but making no connection with the viewer. Beckinsale, the noble warrior, prances around using her pseudo-kung-fu in high-heels and too-tight corset, blandly making me yawn and say ""meh, whatever"". Wenhem, who was very promising in Lord of the Rings, is absolutely wasted here, playing that annoying British sidekick from Relic Hunter. Finally our villain Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) is straight out of Wild Wild West or Shanghai Knights 2, brilliantly laughable. The last nail in the coffin is exactly what this kind of film hinges on: Computer Graphics. Now we all know that computers have revolutionized film making, saving hack scripts from the recycling bin with the promise of ""realistic"" action that will blow our minds. Here's some news Hollywood, WE ARE NOT IMPRESSED. Your shiny flashy computer puppetry can't cover up those stinker stories and one dimensional characters. Like a good music score, CG should be used to augment the action and further the feel and style of the film, not take centre stage and scream ""Look at me, I'm not even real!"" Fine, we've been over this before, and clearly in Van Helsing, we see more than a plethora of CG baddies, flying thingies and gooy green globs floating around. In this case, it doesn't make for a pleasant experience. Top that off with sets and camera work from a bad Wil Smith movie, completely improbable action swinging, luckshots and gaps in logic and you've got few reasons to pay attention.Really, I wanted to like this movie because of the huge ""guy"" factor but there's just too many things to overlook. Here is a prime example of a decent premise that will fade quickly into the forgotten because of over Hollywooding. The only saving grace to Van Helsing is that there was no blatant setup for a sequel. We can only hope.",Van Helsing
534,dreams_sahara,Visually Stimulating,6,13 November 2004,"Unfortunately, I didn't get to see Van Helsing when it was in theaters. I really wish I had. The movie is extremely visually stimulating. If I were to base my grade of this movie soley on visual effects/set/direction I would give it a 10. Unfortunately, the acting was horrible. In general, I think Hugh Jackman is a decent actor, but I didn't find him convincing as Van Helsing. And Kate Beckingsale, while nice to look at, couldn't act her way out of a shoebox. The actor that played Dracula made me laugh more than convince me he was really evil. Overall, I'm not sorry I watched this movie. It is entertaining. But, it could have been better.",Van Helsing

This is a monster movie for goodness sake and if you don't like that genre, don't watch! However, if you DO watch these kinds of movies you shouldn't expect a masterpiece of cinema! It's simply just fun, an assault on your senses with non-stop action and all the Universal monsters we grew up with. I absolutely was glued to my seat and I enjoyed every second of it.

537,brawnybalboa,Think James Bond in the 1850's,7,22 April 2006,"This film is not amazing but is worth a try, it in many respects mimics other films in cheeky ways.However many times Van Helsing jumps out of moving carriages and is picked up from one location and deposited in another he still manages to retain his hat (Think of Indiana Jones).Also at the start his Friend Carl is a friar at the Vatican supplying him with gadgets one hundred years ahead of his time (think Q,MI5 and James Bond).However this film is quite witty, Van Helsing seems to have an answer to everything and I think that Hugh Jackman Brings him to life in a superb fashion, and David Wenham brings the bright 'Not realising the situation' expression to Carl the Friar that created almost impossibly naive moments in the characters life that makes the film all the more enjoyable to watch.One slight problem I found with the movie is that Frankenstine who was made out of Humans had size 17 feet and was 9 feet tall and 360 pounds. This makes him obviously more than average human size but does not explain how he managed to survive a 60ft drop into a fire with a building collapsing on top of him, as he was made of human body parts it is hard to believe that he was able of this.But film does deserve its two awards and it is a good modern remake of the 'old style' monster movies.",Van Helsing

I confess -- I first went to see it because of the rather good-looking Hugh Jackman.But, what I walked away with was how impressed I was with the top-notch acting and the phenomenal special effects, as well.  The characters were portrayed believably and I quickly acquired affection for them.  During times when the protagonist or his friends were in danger, I found myself genuinely caring about them.  I felt empathy for them and their struggles.I think that this is probably the best movie I've seen in the theater this year.

The acting was uniformly good, the special effects weren't as annoying as in most CGI films, and thanks mainly to (the always brilliant) David Wenham there were some funny moments.  Kate Beckinsale was as beautiful as always, but this time she was upstaged by Elena Anaya.  I really hope this young woman, surpassing the ""stardom"" achieved by her Countrywoman Penelope Cruz.

541,codenamev,Very Good Summer Fare,7,17 June 2004,"Stephen Sommers' ""Van Helsing"", like his two most previous efforts ""The Mummy"" and its sequel ""The Mummy Returns"", are very good summer fare. The kind of film you can go into with a big bucket of popcorn to enjoy some escapist fun for a few hours. But it is no more than that. Hugh Jackman is good as the title character as well as all the players, but if you're expecting something great, you're in for a very disappointing experience. The plot plays out very much like a Bond film with a loner hero, a beautiful woman ally, an evil megalomaniac intent on ruling the world, and even a lot of high-tech gadgets (which are EXTREMELY implausible for the time period but who cares?). This film has NOTHING to do with realism. This is, as I said, very good escapism. Sommers obviously has great love for the monster movie genre and it is very appropriate that Universal Studios is the studio it comes from since most of the great classic monster movies that this film pays homage to came from this studio seventy years ago. Ironically, however, those classics, who helped to save Universal from the verge of bankruptcy all those years ago, serves as the inspiration for this film whose budget will certainly never be made back from the domestic box-office grosses. But this is really beside the point. If you want to get out of the summer heat and be entertained for a f hours, check your critical brain at the door and have fun.",Van Helsing
542,billy_man78,"Could be, but it isn't...",3,14 May 2004,"SPOILERS..I watched this movie expecting to see something like Mummy or, at least, like The Mummy Returns. I was not expecting too much. Having thrown in one movie Dracula, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolfman means that it can't be a serious horror movie. Or can it be?? Perhaps in this question Mr Sommers gave the answer ""yes"" or, even worse, ""maybe"". And what's the result?? In one word CATASTROPHE!!! SPOILERS: We have Van Helsing. ""Gabriel"" Van Helsing.The ""left hand of God""!!!Does this ring a bell??It does for me.You want help?? Well, obviously somebody thought it would be clever and deep and intriguing to create a connection between the monster hunter and an Archangel!!Yes, AN ARCHANGEL!!And the excuse is that Mr Sommers did not like the name ""Abraham""!Pretty convincing, right?? We leave that aside and we move on:We have Dracula.And the brides. And they want to have kids (about a million of them!!) and thus destroy the world. And, in order to bring their - obviously dead, since their parents are dead - kids to life, they need Frankenstein's monster.And this monster is hiding in the basement.And it definitely likes Jonh's ""Apocalypse"" as well, since it screams in an advanced shakespearean way ""As I walk in the valley of the shadow and death..."".And we have the good girl's brother who becomes a wolfman and wants to kill the girl.And, of course, we have the beautiful heroine and the sexy hero...And, naturally, when we have all these together, we can have anything but a serious movie.But some people did not seem to realize that. So, we have a script suitable for a good parody, a nice comic relief guy(Wenham) and an excellent portrait of a self-sarcastic Dracula by -clever- Roxburgh. The rest of the cast/crew/film, though, seems to fail to understand how and what. So, they act seriously while dealing with extremely hilarious facts and situations and they end up looking stupid and ridiculous. Obviously Mr Sommers spent large amounts of money on visual fx and other technical things.Perhaps he should spend a little more time in guiding his cast, leading them through the same way into a ""pure-blood"" movie.

543,opiemar,Onslaught of special effects can't rescue this nightmare,5,29 May 2004,"Van Helsing is not a movie, but rather a conglomeration of special effects attempting to be held together by B rate acting and virtually no plot. Granted, while a few of the special effects are cheesy and unrealistic, most are quite impressive, as are the computer graphics. It is easy for the viewer to be drawn into the movie by any of the action scenes.  However, while the special effects are convincing, the acting is equally unconvincing. Like a huge splash of ice water to the face, someone has to speak and we're brought right back into reality.  While there, it doesn't take much to notice the weak, hole-riddled plot.

Familiarity soon breeds contempt in this lame outing where the director goes for louder, brasher and ever more in-your-face special effects in lieu of anything approaching a cogent storyline.  What a shame!  After a brisk and reasonably witty opening, it all deteriorates into something that is simply short on ideas but all too dependent on CGI.

If anyone in Hollywood believes that their job is to do anything more than entertain the ignorant masses, then they have a vastly over-inflated view of their own value to anyone.  ""Great Cinema"" rarely makes for a great film, great entertainment always does.  And that brings me to the topic at hand: Van Helsing.  Hugh Jackman and company aren't going to win any Oscars for this film.  It is most decidedly NOT ""great cinema"" or even ""Mediocre cinema.""  What it is is the most fun and entertaining movie I've seen in a couple of years.  And that includes all of the Lord of the Rings films, Spider-Man (1 & 2), Troy, the Scorpion King, the X-men films, etc.  All of which I liked.  Van Helsing was a non-serious, period-super-hero-action film that never even tries to be art.  Which is good, because it would have stunk if it had. 
You can't beat a movie set in the late 1800's that still manages to have explosions, monsters, and a Gatling crossbow.  And there are quite a few very funny one-liners scattered throughout the film.  Van Helsing doesn't take itself seriously in the least and it shouldn't have to.

It was total waste of money and time.The plot (if there was any) was totally ridiculous and mostly it just copied ideas from other movies of the same genre. The only thing like about this movie is Hugh Jackman. The Dracula was most awful bad guy I have ever seen. It was totally ridiculous. His acting was bad and his vampires were bad actors too. It was more like comedy. And if taking as such you might like it more. The monsters didn't impress me either. It's a shame that Hollywood makes movies non-stop regardless of quality.

But it's definitely up there (down there?) with Battlefield Earth.The special effects in Van Helsing are horribly lacking. The CGI (which is used way too heavily) is over used and LOOKS like CGI. Some of the CGI effects reminded me of Ray Harryhasuen's stop motion creatures from Jason and the Argonauts and the Sinbad movies. (by the way...the special effects in those old films were BETTER than in Van Helsing)The action isn't really all that exciting. Part of the problem is that overuse of CGI...what's the fun in watching two animated characters doing battle with one another? Add to that just about every movement in the action scenes being telegraphed beforehand and you have a real lack of excitement(oh, look, wonder why those chains are there...gee, he's swinging from another on).The script is extremely poorly written. When half the theater is laughing at what's obviously intended to be the most poignant scene in the film, it's not a good thing. Especially where they're groaning at all the (attempts at) humor. And what, exactly, killed one character? Heart attack? They even manage to make Dracula into the only really sympathetic character in the film...and I'm not sure Van Helsing isn't a serial killer.On top of that, EVERY BIT of mythology about vampires and werewolves is completely thrown out the window. This movie is just beyond bad. The only people who should see this are people who really love bad movies like Plan 9 and Battlefield Earth.",Van Helsing
549,weisstein,"Filmmakers ""used"" Prague's St. Nicholas holy ground for ""Vampire carnival""",10,12 June 2004,"Dear God, I still can't believe this can be true(!) I've recognized it at the first moment, the ""Vampire carnival"" scene is filmed entirely in the interior of the ancient and one of the holiest grounds in the old Europe, in the great St. Nicholas cathedral of Prague of Bohemia. They even removed the ancient benches. I feel really disgusted and say angry of what those ignorant cinematographers did.This is and it was one of the most admired and one of the holiest grounds in the old ""Holy Roman Empire"" and the ""Kingdom of Bohemia"". This was the Church of choice (besides St.Peter's) for Emperors and Kings in the middle ages when the Prague was capital city of the Roman empire from the Baltic to Adriatic sea. This is master-piece-church of the Gothic/late baroque, made by the most skilful artists of Italy, Germany and Bohemia for God sake!Church people said that they have no idea of what filmmakers will do in the inside. They ""rented"" the cathedral for some big money so the church people were happy for the ""donation"". My brother said that he saw a spot about it in our local television. I am surprised that the city is not suing producers for this.So what now mr. Sommers ? Will you go to Vatican and use the Sixteen Chapel as your next playground ? Because the old town cathedral at the very heart of Europe is ready for a new dedication after this.Another clear example of ignorance of American filmmakers is the scene where the ancient emperor's Charles IV bridge of Prague and the (obvious) city landscape of Prague is shown and ""the vampiress"" named the city Budapest (!). So the filmmakers now trade Prague for Budapest ? It's like show landscape of New York and say Moscow. Bohemia's Prague has nothing in common with Magiar's Budapest for God sake! It would be better if they use no names at all. The CGI made castle scenes looked fabulous so why they decided to use those well known Prague sightseeing and renamed them.. ? It is odd, it's unoriginal and it feels horrible (at least for mid European).I admire Sommers for his previous flicks, but he will be send to hell for what he did in Van Helsing.:-)",Van Helsing
550,Ms_Q,"Disjointed, uneven (SPOILERS)",5,29 May 2004,"Well, it's certainly not as bad as it could be (the trailer for 'Soul Plane' convinced me of that), but it's not as good as it could be, either. The problem seems to be that the director had no idea other than to put all of these monsters together in one movie. Once he'd achieved that, he didn't seem to much care about the rest of the movie, which served primarily as a means of transitioning from one action scene to another. He never made up his mind whether he was creating a serious monster movie, a monster movie with humorous overtones, a parody of monster movies, or an homage to monster movies, or some combination of the above.The product is disjointed, uneven, unrealized. The soundtrack was relentless, bombastic, and relentlessly derivative. The monsters are so overblown and unrealistic that they lose any power to frighten; they are clearly the creation of mad hackers, not mad scientists. They are incarnations of bits and bytes, not incarnations of evil. The movie lacks any real suspense; we don't much care whether CGI characters disappear from the Matrix  I mean, the movie, and every other 'plot twist' is telegraphed two weeks in advance. Was anyone surprised to discover what or who the 'Left Hand of God' was? Or that Anna did see her brother again?The script provides opportunities for humor, but none are realized due to poor timing and delivery. The biggest laughs came in response to what were evidently intended to be pathos-laden scenes, but were pathetic in a different meaning of the term. The human characters are as flat and two-dimensional as the digital characters. The blame for this lies with the director and the writers, not the actors. They did what they could with what they were given, but it is clear that the director's real concern was with the virtual characters. Exposition is not character development. All we know about the characters is what we are told. Van Helsing never convinced me that he was the scourge of evil; he seemed more like a nice guy caught in the wrong movie and trying to make the best of the situation. He kills monster as a means to self-realization? That New Age psychobabble doesn't even make sense today, let alone in the 19th century. Is he supposed to be a dark, brooding figure, or one with his tongue firmly in his cheek? If the second, his tongue keeps slipping, as does his accent. I heard American, English, and Australian, often in the same sentence. Or was that an obtuse reference to his being a citizen of the world? Others have remarked on the similarities to Hugh Jackman's other franchise character, Wolverine. Suffice it to say that midway through the movie, we were referring to him as 'Logan Van Helsing.' Except that Logan, a true cartoon character, displays a deeper level of angst and human suffering that Van Helsing. We laughed when the werewolf howled.Anna Valerious looks like Wonder Woman by way of Transylvania. There is as much chemistry between Van Helsing and Anna as would be expected between a human and a cartoon character, as well. Unfortunately, her redemption scene elicited giggles and whispers of 'Simba,' rather than sniffles and tears. Well, at least she finally gets to see the sea. Dracula began with a bang and ended with a whimper. The character was wonderfully campily evil to start, but lost all control of his accent and his sense of proportion mid-way through the movie. Apparently his 'I am hollow speech' was supposed to be pitiful; it was merely embarrassing. Matthew Arnold and T.S. Eliot said it better, and so did Darth Vadar. 'Come to the dark side' is much more evocative than 'Join me. We can be partners.' One is an invitation to become one with evil; the other to open a fast food franchise. However, we suspect that it was merely a trick for Nine-Fingered Vladislaus to get his preciousssss  I mean, his ring  back from that thief he hates forever.Plot holes are legion, but a few will suffice. Dracula cannot be killed with a stake through the heart, only by a werewolf; holy water, crosses, and necklaces of garlic also have no effect. Why not? No explanation is given for this violation of hundreds of years of folklore, legend, myth, and tradition. People have lived in a village that has been attacked by vampires for 400 years, and it's never occurred to a soul to upstakes and seek a new life in a new world? And the Knights of the Holy Order wait until there are only two Valeriouses (or should that be Valeri?) left before they lend a hand? That's what I call management by exception. Finally, Van Helsing can remember fighting the Romans at Masada, but he's doesn't look a day over 35. In a different movie, we could put that down to his regenerative abilities; in this one, it has 'prequel' written all over it.",Van Helsing
551,immortal74205,"Awesome adventure, great monster movie!",8,5 May 2004,"When the credits rolled on this one, I nearly couldn't contain myself. This is a fabulous film with fantastic special effects, good acting, a strong story, and a first rate soundtrack!  Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Gabriel Van Helsing is fantastic, as is Roxburgh's part as Count Dracula.  Van Helsing's search to find Dracula and complete his mission is not only bold daring, but full of great creature moments and awesome action.  David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) does a great job as the comic relief Friar who aids Van Helsing and Anna in their fight against Dracula and the other creatures they face. The only thing that I didn't care for was the fact that Frankenstein's monster seemed too human, and able to carry on conversations.  He actually seemed to care.  But that wasn't such a big deal.  I found the film completely entertaining and loads of fun!",Van Helsing
552,beccaj_ilh,"great film, few flaws",10,9 May 2004,"I saw this film yesterday and I have to say it was not as brilliant as I had expected but still very enjoyable film. The overall storyline and action was great but there was a few moments that let it down.SPOILERS The script was good but i found there were a few bad or out of character lines. one of those was, towards the end, when dracula was backing away from van helsing/werewolf and saying something like ""maybe we could be friends"" i found this to be very cheesy and unlike the evil dracula from the rest of the film. Another thing i didn't like was the fact that a few things were not explained fully (although that may just have been me not paying attention). there were also a few cheesy bits like van helsing jumping off the carriage and firing two guns in slow mo.but there were plenty of things i did like about the film. David Wenham was great as the comedy friar and had a lots of funny lines (""I don't know if you've looked in the mirror lately, but you kind of stick out in a crowd."") hugh jackman was good as the dark hero, although i'm not sure what accent he was ment to be doing and kate beckinsale was feisty and sometimes a little bit vulnerable so that van helsing got a chance to come and save her (but i still have no idea how she managed to run or fight in that corset). the opening black and white scene was brilliant and a great way to start the film. i also thought the way frankenstein was portrayed was good. the action scenes were great i loved hugh jackman jumping from horse to horse. the CGI baby vampires (and the CGI big vampires for that matter) looked scarily realistic although they sort of reminded me of the flying monkeys from the wizard of oz. it was not a particularly frightening film but there were a few bits that really made me jump like Mr hyde suddenly appearing from the top of the screen.Over all i give it 8/10",Van Helsing

It was a true pleasure to see the three talented aussies, Hugh Jackman, Richard Roxburgh and David Wenham all in this hollywood blockbuster. I had read a few reviews in the papers saying that the film was well done special effects wise, but didn't have a good story line, but i beg to differ. I went into the film, a little skeptical, thinking that if it was anything like the Mummy Returns i would be dissapointed. But i was proven wrong. I thought the film had a fantastic story, the director/writer Stephen Sommers managed to combine all these mythical monsters into one story and make it exciting and intersting and that in iteslf is quite a challange to do. The cast was perfect, with the handsome and talented hugh jackman as the lead, and the beautiful Kate Beckinsale by his side. The performance that really inspired me was Richard Roxburgh, he is amazing in everything that i've seen him in and i think that hollywood directors are starting to recognise the pure talent this man has. I think this movie is worth while seeing, its action packed, the story is interesting, the special effects are brilliant, all the actors are fantastic. Its a thrill ride, enjoy!!",Van Helsing
555,shadowmonkey,An enjoyable fun packed movie,10,9 May 2004,"There is often too much written into why a film is like it is, and this is something that seems to be happening with Van Helsing.
Van Helsing is everything it promises to deliver. It has action, good special effects, the plot flows well and above it is fun to watch. You know that Dr Gabriel Van Helsing will prevail and Count Dracula will lose. So why read more into it than that. The film is a spectacle that will lose some of its impact going to DVD, but the over all experience will still be enjoyable. The charters are not one dimensional, the good ensemble cast brings colour to the characters, that they obviously had fun playing which in turn makes the film even more enjoyable.I left the cinema after having enjoyed a film that I had been looking forward to since I'd heard of its production (so many moths ago). I would willingly have walked back into the foyer brought another ticket and watch it all over again. I would be happy to say that it would lose nothing on a second sitting.It is a good start to a string of exciting looking summer blockbuster.",Van Helsing

A decent scriptwriter and director should have been included in the huge budget. Even as mindless entertainment goes, ""Van Helsing"" is a pathetic waste of time.  I saw it for free, and I still felt ripped off.  The story-bad, special effects-poor, performances by otherwise fine actors-fair to bad, dialogue-bad, music-inappropriate and annoying.To paraphrase my friend Will Cockrell: -------------------------------------- 1) Take the money you were planning on spending to see van helsing, put it in an envelope.2) Mail it to me.3) Next time I see you I'll show you a picture of Kate Beckinsale in a corset, we'll watch about an hours worth of bad video game cutscenes, and I'll punch you in the crotch.Same difference.----------------------'nuff said",Van Helsing
557,eternal_winner,Underestimated,9,3 May 2005,"If u're no fan of action and wants vampire movies to be slow and non violent this is is not a movie for u. But for me I think this is one of the best vampire movies ever even though all seem to be different from each other. Hugh Jackman is the famous van Helsing and does a favorable impression as a late 19th century action hero taking care of all foul beings.. Kate Beckinsale who I must say is stunning is pretty good too. The rest of the actors are neither doing the best acting or the worst acting ever but fill their roles nicely. All the elements of Romanian lore is put together in this movie and does it really well, with Dracula, Frankenstein and werewolves all in the mix. The effects are well done and a big step from earlier Dracula movies. The overall plot might seem a bit predictable but hey, this is the great van Helsing vs Dracula. The different settings and locations are all well chosen from castles to villages. This is a non stop action with a touch of suspense and i'd like more of this type of movies. What it might lack is some depth and some really memorable acting as nothing really stands out in that regard. But it is a very entertaining movie and puts vampires back in their traditional sense, mystical, very evil and Dracula is where he should be, in his castle in Transylvania...",Van Helsing
558,fixindan,It's bearable,5,6 January 2005,"This movie's not too great. I had a rough day with my college finals last summer, and so I decided to ease my mind at the theaters. I didn't expect much out of Van Helsing after reading the bad reviews on IMDb, but I was really in the mood for a fantasy/adventure film. So I watched this anyway despite of the negativity surrounding it. Sure enough the acting was way over the top and melodramatic, the plot was thin, and the story loses logical sense at times.Maybe some people liked Frankenstein, but I thought his role in this movie was absurd. So absurd it was funny that he alone held the key to bringing the born undead to life. I suppose it makes a little sense since he was made up of corpses, but I still felt Frankenstein was forced into this movie to make it a monster fest.Also Carl reminded me so much of Q in James Bond when he was introducing to Van Helsing the weapons at their disposal. I thought the similarities were hilarious.Then there was the scene at the end with Van Helsing still in his wolf form holding Anna and wailing. It was suppose to be sad, but it was so weird to see a huge hairy wolf passionately holding a woman wearing a revealing outfit that it was rather funny.Lastly the shot of Anna smiling from heaven was just too cheesy.With all this said, I did find this movie bad to the extent of being entertaining. Or maybe I was just really depressed that day. Whatever the case, I took this film as a comedy, and laughed it off. Overall: 5/10.",Van Helsing
559,Grayfox176,eh....,2,31 January 2006,"I know that it was supposed to not be serious, to be just a fun kind of movie... but I still couldn't help but not like it, for the main reason that my knowledge of the creatures in said movie ruined it for me.... main things that made it decent: 1. Kate Beckinsale.2. it was a decent premise, just poorly executed.3. the ones with talent did what they could to keep it alive 4. Kate Beckinsale.The reasons that it was ruined for me: 1. In the beginning, Van Helsing fights Mr. Hyde.... then he goes on to fight lycans (or werewolves for those who don't watch underworld, or care about history), and Dracula... each one of these things were at least a century apart from each other.2. Lycans out at day.... *Shakes head* 3. VAMPIRES out at day... it doesn't matter if it is supposed to be cloudy at the time, they are still out at day.4. the horrible effects, especially when the brides were flying around the town... during the DAY.5. a lycan was stooped on a night of a full moon. someone then said, and I quote: ""The next full moon is in three days."" ....... It is possible for a full moon to happen twice in one month, but it takes roughly a month (About 28 days) for the moon to make a full rotation like that, so it would be impossible for two full moons to happen in three days, 6. Kate Beckinsale, no matter how much she brought to the role, can't use a Romanian accent to save her life.7. the movie had no substance.overall, if I hadn't known so much about them, it would have been livable, maybe even enjoyable...",Van Helsing

561,trryancy,Requires a high tolerance for stupidity,4,14 April 2005,"The only reason I rated this film a four instead of a three is because it held my attention. I may not have been bored, but I was, however, extremely annoyed, almost to the point of being offended. It felt as if the filmmakers gave their their audience no credit for intelligence whatsoever, confident that if they give us enough big-name stars, splashy special effects, PG-13 sexiness, and fast food promo tie-ins that we will gladly shell out $8 bucks for admission and $5 for popcorn and go home happy, without offering us anything of actual quality.Essentially, Van Helsing is a cartoonish genre blend of sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, and comedy. Yet, the real comedy in the film is unintentional; some points in the film are just so dumb you can't help but laugh. Why is Kate Beckinsale dressed like a cross between a matador and a dominatrix? Why dose she go out to fight vampires wearing high heels and heavy jewelry? How is it that she gets thrown across the room several times over without ever messing up her hair? Why does the entire region of Transylvania appear to consist of a single village? How is it that Beckinsale and Jackman fall into a river, yet five minutes later are completely dry? Why is a woman is the most remote part part of Eastern Europe in the 1880's wearing a pair of crack-riding spandex pants? How is it that Jekyll/Hyde doesn't bleed when he gets an entire arm lopped off? It seems these are not considered important details by the film makers, who assume viewers are either not going to notice or not going to care. Well, I noticed, and I cared, but that's just me.On that note, they also take huge liberties with historical accuracy, right from the very beginning of the film. Van Helsing the creature- killer refers to Mr. Hyde as a ""deranged sociopath"", a term which had not yet been invented in the 1880's, before the practice of psychoanalysis was known. Not long afterward, another character refers to Istanbul, which back then was still called Constantinople. Throughout the film, Van Helsing liberally sips absinthe from a flask. Not many people have seen absinthe before, but it is a cloudy, key-lime green color. In the film, it is transparent and bright emerald green, like Nyquil. Furthermore, absinthe was served in an almost ritualistic manner that involves burning a sugar cube over the glass before imbibing; only a rube would go around sipping from a flask. It is also mildly hallucinogenic and even quite toxic in large amounts, which is why it's now illegal. Van Helsing would have been a complete idiot to go around swigging it like it's Red Bull.Although the film uses classic horror films as a point of reference, there's really nothing scary about it at all. Practically every classic horror story ever known is mishmashed into the plot, no matter how briefly; all that's missing is 'The Invisible Man' and 'The Mask of Fu Manchu', and that's probably just because the writers couldn't think of a way to fit them in. Some people may call this ambitious; I think it's just silly.If none of these issues bother you, go ahead, rent it; everyone is entitled to turn off their brain for a couple hours a day. But if you consider cogent plot lines, character development, intelligent writing and a cohesive narrative indispensable, you might want to skip this.",Van Helsing
562,AirborneRanger,Hugh Jackman call your agent,4,3 December 2006,"I must admit, I wanted to like this film. I like Hugh Jackman, but Kate Beckinsale is absolutely wooden in this. The CGI made it more like a comic book than it probably needed to look. This film suffers primarily from its inability to decide whether or not it is self-aware (like the Mummy and the Phantom) with making jokes and asides, or with being dramatic (as in Coppola's version of Dracula). This Dracula seems too campy and not quite sinister. Switching back and forth was a huge mistake.The second problem with this movie is that too much is borrowed or sampled from other movies; too much Bond, too much imaging from the aforementioned Dracula. The high tech weaponry looks cool the first time out, but gets old quick. Much of the existing scenery is overblown as well, castles all out of whack with symetrical design and utility. They would have been better off sticking to formulaic horror movie. Someone call me when Anthony Hopkins plays van Helsing.",Van Helsing
563,smokespiders,a part of me died.......,1,8 December 2005,"The monster who directed this movie should be locked in a room with a copy of the books: Dracula, and FRANKENSTEIN. Failing that, he should locked in a room WITH Dracula and Frankenstein/ And a cctv camera so we can watch as the monters hack to him to pieces. much the same way as he hacked them. It's disgusting that whilst people in this world are starving to death, millions of dollars get poured into TRASH like this. I have no funny, sarcastic remarks to make, because that would only redeem it somewhat. This is truly..TRULY awful. Not even funny to laugh at. There's so much BORING action that there's no real character inter-play.I read an interview with the creep who made this in which he said that it was subtle compared to his previous films, or something like that.

564,Ariel_Ronnie,Van Helsing against the Cartoon People,4,10 September 2009,"Somehow they managed to get beautiful fresh-faced Kate Beckinsdale and lather enough make-up on her to make her a candidate for Madame Tussaud's wax museum. A bit to aggressive with the hair curling thingie didn't help either. No lead had enough ""quiet"" time in which to establish a character...they had the depth of Playstation 3 people. All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in ""dark-o-vision""...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here.

565,Animal-3,Over blown tosh,5,13 May 2004,Only going to mention a few of the reasons the movie lost me. 1 After the failure of league of extraordinary gentleman why bother using another failed Jekyl/Hyde CGI disaster.  Did not add anything.  2 Why add more rope swinging than a Tarzan movie.  3 Why waste the fantastic sex appeal of both the leading characters.  Costume design one high point of the whole thing.  Such a shame as you could see the care in the opening that it led to overblown shots that wasted the truely sinister nature of vampires and their blood sucking biology.  I am truly upset and angry about this movie.  A big CGI budget should be used sparingly.  The Mummy let you marvel at flesh eating scarabs and sinister sandstorms but here the effects just bored.  Remember less is sometimes so much more.,Van Helsing
566,dax-20,"Fangs,but no fangs",1,30 April 2004,"After watching ""Van Helsing"" I must totally agree with Quentin Tarantino, who recently railed against the ever increasing use of CGI. Stephen Sommers´film is one big CGI-orgy! Plot? Logic? Coherence? Characters? Forget it!!! From the very beginning this film tries to clobber its viewers senselessly with one ""highlight"" after the other. As the film isn´t actually about anything except endlessly repeated vampire attacks, incomprehensible fights and chases, you don´t care what happens to the ""characters"";you just sit and stare with growing disbelief at the shoddy effects that don´t fool a five-year old. What was going on in the minds of the people who are responsible for this sorry mess of a film?!Why could Stephen Sommers not make up his mind about the kind of film he wanted to make; a horror film? A comedy? A rousing adventure flick? A touching and tragic love story? It simply doesn´t work to throw in as many of these ingredients as possible into the pot and hope that they somehow melt. Why did nobody raise a hand and utter some kind of objection during the conception and preparation? Do the people who spend huge amounts of money on a project like this really believe this is what today´s cinema goers want? In the end credits Stephen Sommers dedicates the film ""in loving memory"" to his father. What a strange relationship these two men must have had!!!",Van Helsing
567,Jonnyok98ub,Typical Garbage with Too Much CG,1,5 May 2004,"I never thought I would say this, but this is perhaps one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time; it is actually worse in many respects than New York Minute.  The major problem with Van Helsing is that in some ways is in the expectations, which are mainly due to the over-advertising we've been bombarded by since the Super Bowl.  This is one of those May releases that everyone gets excited for, and every time you turn on the TV you either catch an ad for it, or one of its immensely attractive stars sitting comfortably on Jay Leno's couch, discussing how amazing an experience it was to make this movie.  I wish that experience had translated over to the audience I was sitting with.Van Helsing fails because there is really no reason to watch it.  The whole movie is an excuse to do CG, and every place that you could possibly conceive of having a CG image, Van Helsing gives you two.  This film seems like what watching a really high strung individuals daydreams would be like: nothing is static, nothing is developed, everything is constantly in motion, and by the end, you just feel sick to your stomach.  The main plot, and I will try not to simplify it too much, is as follows: Gabriel Van Helsing works for a secret agency in Rome that kills monsters.  He has to travel to Transylvania to help save a family from Purgatory.  Action ensues, attractive people share screen time, there are tons and tons of CG effects, convenient plot twists occur, and the movie ends.  In between these `plot points', we are treated to average action augmented with an incredible amount of average CG.  I felt like I was watching a movie on the Sci-Fi channel about crocodiles that kill babies or something, because the effects are so below average they become honestly distracting.  If there was a plot, and I'm pretty sure there wasn't one, I was so distracted by the bad CG and lack of real environments that I just completely missed it.The acting is average, although a little bit more hammy and fun than I had expected.  For a movie that looks this dark and has this much action, trying to recreate The Mummy was not a wise idea.  What made The Mummy work was the actors really being interested in playing these characters out, as well as the characters themselves being funny and interesting.  The characters in Van Helsing are flat, uninteresting, and seem to be going through the movie on `bad action film' rails.  There are some ups, downs, but mostly this ride just makes you feel sick.In all honesty, I can't even enjoy this film as a campy throwback to an older era, where films were actually made on soundstages and sets had to be constructed.  The physical reality of movie making used to inhibit the imagination of these wild directors, in that their visions had to be tempered to what was possible.  This would result in excellent compromises between reality and fantasy, and would also force filmmakers to focus on characters as opposed to scenery.  Nowadays, with computers, most filmmakers are not limited in their imaginations, and it all pours out onto the screen like so much vomit into an airplane toilet.  After awhile, I just don't care about `cool' or `being impressed', and this film was trying to do both with CG.  If you want to make a good movie, focus on the characters and the story.  If those are strong, CG can really help, and not be such a distraction.3 out of 10",Van Helsing

569,oneshallstand-1,Just atrocious.,2,29 October 2018,"This has to one of the most colossal, audience insulting messes of all time, worse, even, than Transformers 4 in that regard.Stephen Sommers follows up his spectacular job on the Mummy with a movie that looked so damn good on paper, but... well, let's try balance, the good stuff...The opening feels pretty darn good, the black and white intro the frankenstein story. Sure, it's not up to the ancient Hamunaptra intro from the Mummy, but it does a good job and the actors involved sell this oh so well. We move on to Robbie Coltrane voicing Mr hyde, and whilst the Hyde CGI is pretty poor, Coltrane does a great job voicing the villain.After that, we're getting a little vaguer, but... Roxburgh was genius casting as Dracula, after his scene-mastication in Moulin Rouge, this was slightly more subdued, but still oh-so effective and then there were the brides, both in their cgi and *ahem* more fleshy forms they gave the movie a little... something.Now, the bad. Beckinsale is about as charismatic as a bag of carrots although she does prove consistently good at running in heels. I don;t know exactly what that says about her, but when it came down to any confrontation between her and the brides (especially Aleera), for the only time in my life I was on Team Vampire.Jackman was fair, but largely felt like he was on autopilot, he needs something meatier to draw a performance from than 'moody vampire-hunter'. he wasn't terrible, it's just that he could have been anybody right here.Now the plot... I'm quite happy to suspend my disbelief a little for a movie, especially one about monsters, steampunk science and magic, but this was exceptionally dumb and the plot had holes big enough that you could easily fit in castles, Dracula, Frankenstein, Argh and Disney, with adequate space for a shopping mall with plenty of parking, a football stadium and an expansive amusement park based on the theme of 'dumb ideas'. We're somehow expected to believe that travel in one direction takes days, whilst going the other way takes hours, or that a portcullis that drops to water level will somehow prevent humans passing through a passage of water deep enough to allow a boat to pass through. Sorry, this is just dumb.Then there are the toxic ewoks, the randomly awful gravedigger, the vampires who are considered darn-near all-powerful but unable to kill someone who's primary skill seems to be running away, yet without the skill and determination of Rincewind and the sheer awfulness of... well, most of it.Sorry, I tried to like it at release. I even tried to rehabilitate it a couple of years later when my wife went through her Hugh Jackman phase. So, when I chose it randomly in the run up to Halloween this year I figured 'one last chance'. I was right. Last chance. I like the Mummy. I like the Mummy Returns. I'll even sit through the Dragon Emperor, but this movie just fails on so many levels. Bad acting, bad CGI, lazy directing, too many things walking on walls for no reason and that awful werwolf transformation.Sorry, sorry, sorry.

I can't get started on examples because there really aren't words to explain how ridiculous the action is and this review would get bigger than it deserves to be. There was a very definite Batman & Robin/Schumaker vibe to this for me.CGI characters duking it out for the last fight is always a bad thing (see Mortal Kombat II, also, or rather do not see that) unless it's a James Cameron movie.The cast was good but they had NOTHING to work with. There were a couple lines where I could see the actors deadpanning and almost subvocalizing ""this will be cut"" but the lines staid in amongst frenetic scene shifts to keep us from dwelling. I can only imagine what did get cut. If there's a bonus real with the cast cursing out the director or the writer (Sommers) I'd pay to see it.The F/X budget was there (I think).

And a monster who, after being locked under ground for a year, still seems to know how everything works.Look if you're going to give a character exposition, at least give it to someone who knows what their talking about! I mean really, HOW WOULD FRANKENSTEIN KNOW EVERYTHING? He's been in exile. I know the information needs to come out but come on even the 8 year old kid sitting a row away at the screening said:""How come he knows that?"" Bad play Sommers.Nope this movie is a dud. Hugh Jackman is wasted, and so is Kate Beckinsale. It's too cheesy and contains way too many SPFX. What happened to stunt men and stunt women. We can tell, you know, it's not seamless. And the dialogue..Oh my God it's atrocious!!!Mom always said ""If you don't have anything nice to say..."" so I have to say I really liked the woman you played Dracula's Red headed wife: something--ina, she's the last bride to die and she seemed like she was having fun. I also dug the...no I didn't it sorry. The rest sucked. Too bad I thought ""The Mummy"" was fun.",Van Helsing
573,Dr_Strangelove1,"Very bad, yet very funny (in a bad way).",1,10 November 2004,"Being a big MST3K fan, I enjoyed ridiculing this movie for over 2 hours. The evil Dracula reminded me of Riverdance and his love nest of women obviously enjoyed ""acting"" to the 10th power. Van Helsing's side kick was dropping bad jokes left & right, but after 45 minutes you just wanted him to die. Van Helsing tried to be cool, and suave he is not! Just watch the scene when he plops his ten-gallon hat on Anna's head and you will know what I mean. The acting was horrible and the director is to blame because some of the cast has a descent track record. For those familiar with the Black Adder episode ""Sense & Senility"", well its like the cast of this movie had been coached by the Shakespearian actors Mr. Keanrich & Mr. Mossop :)Watching Van Helsing on DVD was also educational for me. I'm no audio guru, but I now know what bad audio production is! During the few scenes that didn't contain any CG monsters or action, the dialogue would literally fade out when certain sound effects took place (like the 'sheen' of a sword being drawn). I should also mention the horrible over dubs and lip syncs. They were so bad that I felt like I was watching MXC! Cool! :)The CG had potential in some areas. I enjoyed the 1st werewolf scene and a coupe of shots towards the end when Dracula's little demons were flying about the village, but over all I wasn't impressed considering the talent displayed on other films that required lots of CG. The compositing and camera tracking were weak.Finally, the music. Just plain awful considering the genre of this film. The score might have worked for a Summer Olympics broadcast back in the 80's, but... Ahhh, forget it.1 out of 10.",Van Helsing

Usually they are right but sometimes, good movies score low and boring movies score high.This is def. one of those times to discard the avg. ratings.While the plot contains no twists and the avg. viewer should be able to figure out what this movie is about very quickly.It is a action-packed film. The encounters with the many creatures he faces are lively.Going through some of the written reviews, many reviewers don't know what to review and what to skip just because it wasn't meant to wow viewers in the first place. This is a awesome fantasy world movie and if you came to see a movie with endless subplots that make your mind insane...don't watch this.",Van Helsing
575,whiskeyann,Don't waste your time.,6,8 May 2004,"Bad acting, bad story but at least the wolfman was hot!  If you really want to see this movie wait till it comes out on DVD.  Don't waste your time or your money.  I was really disappointed in this movie.  I kept expecting Hugh Jackman to turn into Wolverine, from the X-men series, a couple of times. The Brides of Dracula couldn't act their way out of a coffin. If only Frankenstein was given some acting ability when they were out collecting body parts. David Wenham who plays Carl provide a couple of funny moments but I couldn't get past his character Faramir in the Lord of the Ring series.  Kate Beckinsale is beautiful as always.  This movie reminded me too much of The Mummy, Stephen Sommers might have has success with the way he directed The Mummy but it didn't work with Van Helsing.",Van Helsing
576,thomaswrobel,Brillent,10,7 May 2004,"This movie dosnt pretend to be anything its not. It is FUN. It blends loads of different myths together smoothly and originally. So what if its black & white, 1D characters and co-incidences that would make 24 look plausible. Its simply fun to watch. Its both witty, and with a nice tension that is consistant all the way though it.Please, watch this film, enjoy it. Dont listen to the critics that attempt to anaylise it.I loved every second of this right upto the end. The only bit that annoyed me was the slightly corny effect right at the end...but it didnt spoilt the film.",Van Helsing

I think the action is great and the special effects top notch, who cares if there are loop holes in the story or its not realistic , after all its not a drama or a true to life story. Van Helsing have all the action, adventure, horror, comedy and fun you can ask for in a movie. Hugh and Kate did a great job of bringing the story to life. So my advise to all is go see this movie , sit back and relax and let your imagination roam free for the 2 hours ! I would rate this movie 8.5 out of 10.",Van Helsing
578,Sarkax,Stick a pole through this one!!,2,22 June 2004,"A movie whit Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, Werewolfs and Van Helsing should be a pretty cool flick on the paper. Director Stephen Sommer did make the average ""The Mummy"" and the not so good sequel. But this time he decided to put all the old universal monster in one movie. The result? Total garbage, no one whit the least taste for movies can give this one a good review. This suck on so many levels and the monster of Frankenstein is maybe the worst one ever to be put on screen. A monster movie should rely on the atmosphere and the gothik feeling but this one is molested whit sh***y computer FX and why does half the movie take place among ropes that the cast is flying back and forward in all the time? Shame on you Mr.Sommers, shame on you. Give us the real monsters back!!!",Van Helsing
579,LiZard15,What I got Grounded for...,10,26 June 2004,"Opening night of Van Helsing I went and saw it with two of my closest friends and did we have a ball with this film!This movie is beautifully done. From the sets to the acting. All the actors seemed to fit their characters perfectly. Hugh Jackman I had to laugh at for not knowing who the heck he is again in this film after seeing X-men earlier that day in which he doesn't have his memory either. I found him totally believable as the monster hunter and found him quite entertaining in the role. Throughout this horror flick as in The Mummy and The Mummy Returns also directed by Stephen Sommers comedy is brought in by the different characters in this film the comedy relief is Carl played excellently by David Wenham. But where's a horror flick without a villain or horrifying beasts? In the role of our main villain is Dracula played by the talented Australian actor Richard Roxburgh. This actor has yet another accent to entertain the world with in this film as the Transylvanian vampire Count Dracula. (I say another accent because in the other three i've seen him in they're all different!) I'm getting to use to seeing him as a bad guy and still thinks he has done another great job at being the villain. His acting like the others in this film is excellent.Despite what others may think, I did not find any real ""gore"" throughout this entire film. Blood is seen being drank by the brides of Dracula but that's probably, for me at least, the most realistic looking blood in the whole film. It was also strangely the one that got to me the most as well. There are the fight scenes that are intense at time but not at all bloody. The creatures are not the most realistic things on the block but they are done very well and I am glad they didn't make Dracula's changed form into a tiny bat. A fight between a huge Jackman werewolf and a puny bat would have been more hilarious as well as stupid but I am still impressed with the CGI of the movie. Women will like this film because of all the attractive male actors in it guys will like it for the action and cleavage from Dracula's brides. Sommers has done it again and I must say seeing this movie was worth getting grounded for. Great job to the cast and crew of Van Helsing.",Van Helsing
580,poshy,Fantastic entertaining movie!,10,13 January 2005,"This is definitely one of the best movies of 2004. After being disappointed with the likes of 'The Day After Tomorrow' and 'I, Robot' this was definitely a highlight of 2004.Hugh Jackman did a great interpretation of Van Helsing and so did Kate Beckinsale as Anna. A great entertaining movie with lots of special and visual effects, combined with a great story. This movie is far better than any of 'Lord of the Rings' movies - 'Van Helsing' shows us a real adventure and it's not boring for even one second, while we get tired and (or) fall asleep while watching 'Lord of the Rings'.This is a fantastic movie and it definitely deserved all those millions it earned around the globe.A masterpiece of 2004. The year 2004 was probably the worst year in movies, but this film definitely showed that there are still great films out there. Big congratulations to director Stephen Sommers for such a brilliant film.The only other film that can manage to conquer 'Van Helsing' as 2004s best picture is definitely 'Spider-Man 2' but even that movie gets kinda boring in some parts and it's a little too long, while 'Van Helsing' lasts pretty long as well, but it's not boring for even one second.The special and visual effects were amazing during the whole movie, and i just adore movies that are so entertaining and full of action, and has a great story and great actors on the other side. Fabulous.10/10",Van Helsing
581,jarzan2003,Its a roller-coaster ride.,7,1 November 2004,"You have to enter a certain mindset to watch this movie. If you are a purist, or wish to see a movie that has plot, drama and character development, then don't watch this movie. If you are looking for realism, then stay away. But if you just turn off your mind and go for the ride, its a fun way to waste some time.. I enjoyed the movie very much. It was practically action packed from the word go. There are times where I said to myself, ""This is way too over the top."" But that is what this movie is. Its a roller-coaster ride. You don't go on a coaster thinking about life and realism. You just go for the ride. Van Helsing is just that. Too bad it didn't have a good plot, but for what its worth, it was an overload on the senses. I gave the movie a 7/10. But that is misleading. I give it around a 4/10 for acting and plot, but a 9/10 for action. That is why it is necessarry to enter this movie with the certain mindset I've been talking about. Then you too will enjoy this movie.",Van Helsing
582,jblippman,Waste of time,1,29 October 2004,"Too bad the writer/director didn't pay closer attention to the great movies he was homaging in this stinker. Way too much over the top action and NO legit storyline or character development left us not caring whether anybody lived or died. There were tiresome holes in the story you could drive a team of horses through - clearly Summer trying to shoehorn suspense into his story at the expense of continuity. Just another ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". Lots of special effects and good actors wasting their time with a lousy script. The fellow playing Dracula wasn't too great though - lots of hissing his lines venomously without any interesting inflection or nuance to make him more than a cardboard villain. But you really can't blame the actors here. I doubt they got much direction and just had to do the best they could.",Van Helsing

I enjoyed the characters, and thought that they made good choices for the parts.  If you enjoy a good movie that makes you jump from time-to-time, then go see Van Helsing.  The special effects really good, and I loved they way the movie started out in black and white.  I hope to see Van Helsing nominated for special effects or for costumes this year.  They must truly deserve it.Oh, and if you also enjoy seeing Hugh Jackman run around in a loin cloth, this is a definite must see.  He's been working out, and it shows!!!

587,samson_k,A Wasted Opportunity,3,6 December 2005,"I loved the idea of Van Helsing as a character - in fact I loved it in 1993 when it was announced that Anthony Hopkins was about to reprise the role from Coppoloa's Dracula in a film called 'The Van Helsing Chronicles' - the whole idea of a monster hunter, while not original is always appealing (in fact I kind of wished that instead of 'The Mummy Returns' Sommers had made a sequel about Evie and Rick facing up against another of the Universal monsters.However, Van Helsing shot its wad severely by including three (four if you include Mr. Hyde) of the established heavy hitters of the Universal stable in the first film. Who was left? The Invisible Man, The Gill Man and The Phatom of the Opera.It sort of aped the philosophy of the later Universal films when they were trying to grab audiences in the later, declining years - slam as many monsters in as you can. Now that was alright for the Monster Squad as it was a one off film but with a potential franchise it was an incredibly stupid mistake.Also, the fact that Sommers seems to have lost any of the leanness of story telling that made Deep Rising and The Mummy such fun that the whole affair became so damned bloated that it effectively screwed up a character that could have had a lot of potential and that's the tragedy.The storyline was so bloated that it became difficult to care for any of the characters and some of the choices for characterisation smacked heavily of TV Pilot movie sensibilities - Van Helsing did not need to be immortal (or whatever muddied nonsense was hinted at in his final confrontation with Dracula).The acting was fine from Jackman, Wenham and Beckinsale - was superb from Frankensteins monster, was bland from the wolf man and was almost unwatchable from Dracula and his Brides - it was almost as if Richard Roxborough (an actor I usually rate) thought that the movie was 'Carry on Dracula'.A terribly wasted opportunity that did the unforgivable thing - by becoming an action film that became boring and turgid.",Van Helsing
588,hydro_hog,"Richard Roxburgh was the real star, not Hugh.",8,7 August 2004,"I saw this film in the cinemas and I thought Hugh Jackman was good as always but it was Richard's Performance as Dracula that blew me away. A lot of people have dumped this film but i loved the whole classic character feel to it... OK, the hi'tech weapons took that away but i liked the use of them because it mixed the old literature characters and added some modern stuff which i thought blended in brilliantly.The first bit with Dr.Freinkenstein and his monster was excellent brining back the feel of the original story... But then they included the brilliant Richard Roxburgh with the rich Romanian accent as Dracula and the werewolf with even a sighting of Mr.Hyde by Robbie Coltraine, also including Igor and more.. I think this took what LXG had and replaced the 'cheesier' feel with the darker side that made Van Helsing what it is...But really, I thought Richard Roxburgh was the star as to me. he's one of the best actors when it comes to accents, he was also brilliant as 'm' in LXG by the way...8/10 worth the slice of pie",Van Helsing

But i missed the plot, if there was a one. I never noticed it. This movie was like a car going high speed, but not stopping at all. At some point it ran out of fuel, and that is what this movie was i think. It had every potential to be a great movie, but i think i could write a better script then the one they were using!If you want to see a movie where they slaughter a lot of vampires and other creatures, watch the Blade movies instead.

590,tafkaga4,Annoying cgi-loaded kiddie movie,3,6 February 2006,"Jam packed with witty one-liners between hero and villain, distracting special effects, and unrealistic ""whoa dude like, cool!"" moments, this film is one to avoid unless you are looking for a light hearted shallow adventure flick.Unless you find Frankenberry and Count Chokula to be scary, you won't be the least bit frightened by this one either. This movie doesn't evoke tension or suspense whatsoever. It's in-your-face monsters for the whole two hours. It's impossible to take the ""horror"" seriously, since the heroes don't seem to be the least bit scared throughout the entirety of the movie. Van Helsing, much like Batman, spouts one-liners while seeming completely relaxed as he takes on Dracula and his dark minions.This is definitely more of a fantasy movie for kids, very reminiscent of Batman with Van Helsing as the superhero with his wide variety of gadgets (gas-powered rapid-fire crossbow anyone?).",Van Helsing

If you're a monster movie fan, or if you like action films Van Helsing is the movie for you. It's a monster lovers dream come true as it contains Dracula, The Wolf Man, Frankenstein, his monster, Igor, and even Mr. Hyde as a bonus and Stephen Sommers gets very creative in combining these classic characters. Take the production design of Allan Cameron who designed films like Stariship Troopers and The Mummy. Then you have the cinematography of Allan Daviau who received Oscar nominations for his cinematography on Avalon, Bugsy, E.T., The Color Purple, and Empire of the Sun. Take those two combined with the imagination of Stephen Sommers, and you get a spectacular visual fest. The film isn't perfect. There is quite a bit of dumb dislodge, with dull performances from the actresses that play Draculas brides.

It is not the greatest film in the World, but it is exciting and fun to watch.Somethings in this movie are a little over the top and at times a little corny, but that is what makes it so good. Hugh Jackman is the one I was most impressed with. He made Van Helsing very handsome and fun to watch. I enjoyed Kate Beckinsale, but this was not one of her best films, she did a good job though! The other actors did a very good job as well, but again Hugh Jackman really stoled the movie and was the best out of all! Van Helsing is at times funny, exciting, and keeps you on the edge of your seat at times. It is not as bad as some people make it out to be. This is a good movie to watch on a rain day, a boring Sunday afternoon or on Halloween.Check out Van Helsing if you love a lot of action!",Van Helsing
593,KSUFootball900,Horrible mockery to classic literature,1,19 November 2005,"I was very pessimistic about van Helsing from the moment I heard about it, and I stayed away from it until it was shown at a Halloween party that I went to. I wish I had never seen it. It was worse than i could have imagined. I will start out with the things that are not quite what I'm mad about but still are just sad. The acting.....sucks. The plot.....sucks. Everything else...........really sucks. Although the scene that I hated the most was when they were at the ball and all of the guests were vampires....and o yeah that monk who was also miraculously an inventor....just happened to have his invention that he didn't know what it was until van Helsing was running away...then he found out it was freaking gigantic bomb! Completely retarded.Now, why I really hate the movie. It is the most heinous assault on classic literature that I have ever witnessed. It took three of the best books ever written, Dracula, Frankenstein, and The Mysterious Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, it took these books and completely desecrated them.We'll start with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll in Mr. Hyde form is a hunched deformed old man who is completely insane, he attacks people with his cane and fists and runs people over etc., In the movie Mr. Hyde in the movie is a gigantic pink muscle that swings around the rafters of some old church steeple.......completely disgusting. Oh yeah and when van Helsing kills him and he is falling and as he is falling....he turns into Dr. Jekyll! In the book he needs the special antidote to change himself back into his original state.Now. Frankenstein. The movie the whole crap about him being electric and fleeing to the burning windmill with the village people after him. Every movie ever made about Frankenstein includes this. Frankenstein is all parts human no parts electricity or metal. He is a complete human sown together out of human parts they did not pump him with electricity, he just put him together and he was alive...not freaking electricity involved. No freaking burning windmill, or villagers. He was made in a laboratory at a college and the only one who knew of him was his maker, Frankenstein.Last, and most brutally abused, Dracula, the best book ever. First let me start off with the main character. In the book van Helsing is an old man, a doctor who knows how to kill vampires. Not a renegade monster slayer. Second, this book defined vampires, it created them, and the movie sacrifices the vampires limits and restraints for the sake of the shallow adventure fan...no they are not all powerful. No they cannot spread their wings and fly. The only way a vampire can fly is by changing into a vulgar flying creature i.e. a bat. Third, what the heck is up with the automatic crossbow....no, they would not have it back then. Fourth, weapons equivalent to that of a predator are not needed and certainly not used ever in the book. You want to know how they really kill vampires? They ply open their coffins and get them with a stake, or put a wafer on them a communion wafer. No special weapons.Well I could keep going forever about its flaws, but i will spare you. True book fans will not watch this movie.",Van Helsing
594,bonafide_hippie,An extremely dangerous roller coaster ride that's about to fall of the tracks,1,16 July 2005,"Van Helsing.....What a gigantic, time wasting, piece of Garbage. I Absolutely HATED this movie. This is the perfect example of a blockbuster only existing to exploit the film medium and to insult the intelligence of the audience. No wait, wait a minute, do today's audiences even care about good storytelling in movies anymore? No matter. It's one of those movies where people will flock down to the movie theater, waste their money, be excited by it, then a day later, they will forget why they were excited by it in the first place. The story is beyond ridiculous and cliché, and the acting is bland and laughable. It felt like a dangerous roller coaster that was about to fall of the tracks and I was about to die. Literately. I really felt like I was about to be killed, and I felt traumatized by it. In the words of Roger Ebert, I say,""I hated this movie. I hated, hated, hated, hated, hated this movie. Hated it.""

596,Buguise,A Monstrosity,1,18 August 2005,"With a plot that is pieced together much like Dr. Frankenstein's monster, this movie almost singlehandedly destroys the romance of the classic horror films which precede it. It's not the actors' fault. They can hardly be faulted for dialog that lacks the charm of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". On the contrary, Jackman, Beckinsale, Roxburgh, Wenham and Hensley give good performances within the limits of the material they are given to work with. The special effects are passable--at times even engaging; the direction and cinematography, tolerable if somewhat derivative.It is the script itself which is the problem. It fails as horror, a genre which requires at least some minimal degree of psychological involvement. It fails as thriller for, when Van Helsing finally confronts the moment of truth, this viewer simply did not care. It fails in clarity because it is not possible to parse whether our Van Helsing is a force for good or whether he is simply an amoral 007 on a mission from God. In his own words, he is something of a murderer and something of a destroyer of evil. However, the script never allows him to reveal any conflict between the two.In summary, this is an adventure without conflict, more monstrous than of monsters, more horrible than of horror.",Van Helsing
597,James-280,Rip roaring homage to classics,8,7 May 2004,"This is a very ""Stephen Sommers"" film, were you not to know it is the same director as the Mummy you would guess it within 20 minutes. However it should be pointed out that this is not a bad thing at all. The movie is a rip roaring adventure with some wonderful camp humour and great special effects. The plot consists of Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) being part of a special order of the Vatican to kill all unhuman / evil creatures, so amazingly he is sent of to Transylvania where he is to kill Dracula, the sub plot being that Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale) is the last in the line of a family who's mission for centuries has been to kill Dracula themselves. If Anna dies before Dracula, being the last in the line will condemn the whole family to eternal damnation.While the plot isn't the strongest in the world, it actually doesn't make any difference as the special effects and incredible pace of the film doesn't really give you much chance to contemplate any deeper meanings or plotlines.The poster campaign has featured heavily on this film containing Dracula, Wolfman and Frankenstein's monster, though there are other wonderful classic characters which make the film an even bigger joy to watch for example Igor and Dr Jekyll with the former character becoming a wonderful stereotype of the hunchbacked laboratory assistant.Strangely, the chemistry between Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale doesn't have the same spark or passion as Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz in the Mummy saga, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the two characters are not the typical leading man and lady who will obviously fall in love, which again gives this film quite a refreshing edge.David Wenham as Carl, a friar sent to look after Van Helsing gives the comedy edge with wonderful one liners and a constant cheeky glint in his eye.The monsters themselves are a perfect homage to Hammer Horror / Boris Karloff films although I personally found Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) a little bit too camp and less evil although his character was certainly a more evil Dracula than has been seen recently. His 3 brides are possible the surprise highlight of the film turning from beautiful women to gargoyle-like creatures in a split second are a joy to watch in every sense of the word.The wolfman metamorphosis is (as has been reported) an incredible piece of special effects, with the victim tearing off his skin to reveal fur and vice versa throughout the change. But the important thing here is the word victim! Stephen Sommers has kept very close to the original stories portraying the wolfman as a helpless victim ""it's not his fault, he can't help it"" and this is no truer than in the excellent portrayal of Frankensteins Monster (Shuler Hensley) who as written by Mary Shelley is not an evil creature out for destruction, but more a lost soul out simply to be able to exist.My only complaint would be that some of the CGI effects take over. While Sommers has obviously learnt from the travesty that was the CGI Scorpion King, there are times when characters are swinging from walls and ropes that you feel you are watching an animation rather than a live film. However, because these effects are also extremely well done, it is more of a criticism on the viewer who has obviously been spoilt with such effects recently.The pastiges of this film are truly a joy, with references to James Bond (in a highly enjoyable scene about selecting weapons), X-men, Matrix, Aliens, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Rocky Horror and countless other more obvious Horror classics.Hugh Jackman (finally deserving his first lead role) is incredible and this role shows what a fantastic (and without doubt one of Hollywoods hunkiest) actors he is. This is truly his film and deservedly so, not that he ever wasn't in my eyes, but this film has now made him one of the industries hottest property!This is an adventure of a film which all ages will enjoy and I highly recommend it, there isn't time to find fault as the pace will have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.",Van Helsing
598,b_chalmer,It's Another Sommers Film,7,29 October 2004,"Van Helsing is the latest installment of Steven Sommers. It is not about curses or mummies, but has the same general hokiness and camp that I expect from the movies he's directed so far. Partially the delivery and feeling is due to the actors. The movie wouldn't have worked if they'd taken it seriously. The whole point of movies such as this are the delivery of the lines, and how well it's written, if it doesn't make you giggle or at least smile, then the movie hasn't done it's job. Van Helsing is not the best Steven Sommers has done, but for the most part it delivers.Reviewers said there were too many special effects, too many sequences devoted to action. The answer is yes, there are too many. This movie tends to suffer from ""I have too much money to burn through let's use it all."" One of the charms of The Mummy was the fact that there was one threat and the good guys had to deal with it. Special effects were used only for when the mummy was rebuilding itself and the minions fighting Brendan Fraser's character. The rest of the movie properly had a love story with the action.Sommers should have left it at that with Van Helsing. The characters are interesting, he brings up good mystery with Van Helsing by giving him a past he doesn't know. But just as we might get too interested, the movie is over-run with too many plots. And, though I hate to say this, too much action.I enjoy action sequences as much as the next, but I like to see some better reason for them. The point of action is to be paced well, like all good things there must be some respite for the watcher as well as the character. Is there a reason why he does what he does? Or a love story in Van Helsing? Definitely there are hints of attraction, but that's pretty much as far as it goes for the guy. Why? because he can never catch a break when fighting bad guys.Overall the acting is well done, what there is of it, with overtones from the other films that each of the actors have been in. There are also the inevitable echoes of The Mummy, especially whenever Kevin J. O'Connor is on screen. So, should you see this movie? Yes it's a wonderful thing for an otherwise empty night, and if you're an old horror movie fan, or just love Young Frankenstein, then you'll love the opening sequence. Done in black and white it provides a tone, where, if you're not careful, you might reminisce about for the rest of the show.",Van Helsing

600,Bastard Out of Carolina,It's Just Camp,6,11 January 2005,"I'm really baffled at the hateful negative response to this film. No it's not Oscar material, it's just good campy fun. If you're a fan of old monster movies, James Bond and Indiana Jones flicks, and over-the-top humor in an action/horror movie, then you get it. I guess if you're looking for a summer action flick that takes itself too seriously, then you're out of luck with this one.I admit that the film runs a little to long, the chemistry between Beckinsale and Jackman leaves something to be desired, and the Frankenstein ""monster"" (though well-intentioned to give a nod to ""Young Frankenstein"") is really annoying. But the entertainment spawning from the hokey fun that ""Van Helsing"" is all about, makes these flaws so forgivable.For me, I'll take the over-acting screaming Brides of Dracula, the silly homages to dozens of classic action and horror movies, the cheesy one-liners, and the not-so-convincing special effects. Isn't that what monster movies are all about?",Van Helsing
601,hybrid_theoryium,Cant get any better than this.,10,23 May 2006,"***THIS COMMENT CONTAINS A lot OF SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!!!!!*** Alright...both Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale star in this movie...hmm..IT CANT GET ANY BETTER THAN THIS!!! Now, since I'm a girl, partly why i think this movie is awesome is because Hugh Jackman is so damn hot. And Kate Beckinsale is a very beautiful actress, so its a perfect cast for the movie, in my opinion. Both are fabulous actors and they can keep it serious while also having fun. The outtakes of this movie are funny i think. Well..you got you handsome monster hunter Gabriel Van Helsing(Hugh Jackman) and your beautiful gypsy princess and vampire hunter Anna Valerious (Kate Beckinsale). While Van Helsing has lost his memory, Anna has to live with the awful memory of her parents death and also her more recent brothers. Upon being attacked by Dracula's brides i the beginning of the movie, Van Helsing is sent to destroy Dracula and ends up meeting Anna and saving her life. The two decide to hunt Dracula together and Anna must stay alive to defeat Dracula which adds to Van Helsings pressure. They go to Castle Frankenstine to find Dracula using her werewolf brother as a power source for his children to come alive. Anna is separated from Van Helsing during the chaos and she finds her brother. She tries to save him since he has not yet changed into his werewolf form, and unfortunately he starts to transform and attacks her. Meanwhile, Van Helsing meets Dracula and he stabs him with a silver steak, only to find it doesn't work and then after the next chaotic scene passes, he retreats to get Anna,saying her again, and they end up being alone for two days. After everything plays out, Anna and Van Helsing finally have their first kiss and he ends up saving her family and freeing their souls so they can go to heaven(because he killed Dracula). However in a desperate attempt to save Van Helsing from the werewolf curse(which happened after he and Anna were shacked up for two nights out roaming around and falling through that old windmill)she lunges at him trying to inject the cure into him,but he pounces on her unable to help it and the force of him landing on her causes her spine to snap and it instantly crushes her. A very tragic ending, Van Helsing holds her in his arms howling at first then he regains his human form and the howls become crys. the only woman he ever truly loved had died. And she is also forced to watch the only man she has every truly loved walk on alone in life without her and her without him. i gave this movie a 10!!!!It really deserves a 50 though.(laughs) Kyotaku, the stray cat.",Van Helsing

I was really interested in seeing this film when it came out for many reasons.. 1)another spin on Dracula;2) Hugh Jackman and 3) I was just about to move to the Czech Republic, where most of the film was shot.I live there now and am watching the film on TV, dubbed, sadly but it's what lead to this comment.. the film does offer up some fun references to other films - and as mentioned gives us one of the best Frankenstein's monsters since Clancy Brown in the horrible ""The Bride"".I have to say the only thing I really didn't like about this film was the werewolves.. way to much CGI -- I really haven't seen a werewolf that I liked in recent films.Hugh's character looks like Vampire Hunter D, the really wonderful Anime vampire hunter, so that's a nice touch.For doubters of the quality of this film.. it's worth taking a look.

It was a show that was conveyed using strips of cellophane rapidly running in a loop so that the photographed images appeared to be moving. `Ergo' (love that word usage in Matrix 3) it is called a movie.  Now, we have been conditioned to accept and appreciate these Hollywood movies while growing up.  There is a reason why most PG-13 movies are the way they are, and this was a good example.  They (the establishment jokingly referred to in J&TPussycats) want us to spend our money. If you've watched this film (like I have) then, they succeeded.Two observations: You were entertained: whether you like it or not, and whether you enjoyed the entertainment or not. You really had no choice: this weekend, there were not a lot of good movies being mass distributed.As a side note, some people talk about getting the two hours used to watch this film, and their money, back.  Honestly, how many minutes and hours, and how much of an effort have you used bashing it?  Do you not consider this time wasted?  And why not? Because it was the opportunity to bash something you may never do, or be good at if you did do?It was good to me.  Mainly because the true purpose of films/movies is to create a world (real or contrived) and remain true to it.  I specifically refer to this movie as a movie and not as a film (ask me why another time). It is a summer movie too!  C'mon!

608,comedicactor2840,"All In All, A Good Universal Monster Movie",7,7 May 2004,"I saw Van Helsing this afternoon.  i thought it was very well done.Without giving to much away, I'll tell you the basic plot. *Possible Spoilers Ahead*  The Vatican has sent their professional monster slayer Van Helsing to Transylvania to kill Dracula, so the Valerious family can finally find rest (For they have sworn not to enter heaven until Dracula is killed). There he meets Anna Valerious the last surviving member of the family (Due to her brother's encounter with one of Dracula's werewolves.).  They then team up, and learn that Dracula is searching for Frankenstein's monster, who is (and I won't reveal why) the key to bringing he and his three brides' children to life.The complaints I've heard, so far, on these boards is that ""The monsters aren't like they were in the novels!"".  Well, get over it.  They aren't supposed to be.  Instead, Stephen Sommers (the writer/director of The Mummy) has opted for the Universal Studios versions of the monsters.  It seems that he was actually going for a ""re-envisioning"" (fancy term for remake) of two earlier Universal films ""The House of Dracula"" and ""The House of Frankenstein"", two of Universal's attempts at reviving their dwindling classic monster franchise.  Look at this version's Frankenstein. Physically, he looks like the Boris Karloff version, but mixed with some aspects from the novel, and Sommers' own interpretation.  The actor who plays Dracula even seems to be channeling Bela Lugousi (Which, in my opinion, is much more entertaining than Gary Oldman's take on the character.) This movie works much better than the earlier ""House of"" movies did, thanks to today's special effects.My only complaint was a quick addition of Mr. Hyde, who doesn't work in this as well as he did in ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" (Which went with Literary films.) because they opted for the CGI effects, and he comes across (much as the Hulk did) as an evil version of Shrek.  Since it was going the ""Universal"" direction, they should have made him look like the earlier films.All in all, though, this movie works in its own way.  Turn your mind off, and enjoy.**** (Four stars out of Five Stars.)",Van Helsing
609,mitesh-sahu,Fantastic - Nothing but Fantastic!!!,8,29 December 2013,"As I have mentioned, this movie is nothing but FANTASTIC... I have read both Mary Shelly's Frankestien and Bram Stoker's Dracula but this is beyond both. In the true sense of Novels, I have loved it. It sums up the futuristic and medieval novels to an extent that it becomes a story of its own. Whilst, I would not want any human being on this earth to miss this movie still for the sake of it, I will write a review. It contains and mixes Sci-fi, spiritual and gorish elements that make it ordinary but still it draws inspiration from all of these.The story is simple, Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman) has to stop Dracula and he does not know how. He gets a warrant from Rome and executes it with the help of his companion Carl(David Wenham). Stephen Sommers is a director of too much grit in movie making. He has chosen to give Mummy's incredible power and believes that just like God evil has its own will to move forward. This movie does the same. Challenge the Almighty and fail. The ultimate fight of Good vs Evil. Where good wins because the will and not the weakness of the evil. A fight to death that makes Dracula believe that he has finally found his match. The portrayals of the character of Dracula, Van Helsing(different first name) has been epic. The visuals according to me whether CGI or just plain movie making have been good. Maybe due to my Indian heritage I felt the movie was less time consuming still I feel it was perfect. While Kate Beckinsale, Josie Maran and the other two ladies make the men go mad Hugh and Richard Roxburgh make the women crazy with their intelligent & beautiful acting. It is a perfect movie to be seen during a holiday. Alan Silvestri makes it good with the background score and the people acting in it bring it to life. A story weaved with logic, reason and fantasy. A perfect blockbuster with good cast and music. Watch it for a good re- imagination of the books that this movie relates to. 8 stars of 10. Would love another Van Helsing movie with a bit more.A late review but fans' of Dracula, Frankestien and Hugh would love it. Still wonder why Hugh chooses movies that makes sure that the woman his character loves won't be with him . May be he loves his wife too much.Watch it as a couple of classic stories with a modern twist.",Van Helsing
610,jamesaxbrice,I Wish I Had Stayed Home.,1,13 May 2004,"I went to see Van Helsing thinking I would at least be partially entertained. I was wrong. I was bored out of my everlovin skull. The acting was abominable, and it was probably the best thing about the movie. I have rarely been exposed to such a toxically bad script. The ""monsters"" looked like something from the movie Shrek, and I'm not exaggerating. As a matter of fact I think Mr. Hyde was played by Shrek if I'm not mistaken. The outfits worn by the Van Helsing character and the unbelievable heroine were so ridiculous that I had to consciously force myself not to roll my eyes. And the Werewolf... Lord! How do I describe the failure of the Werewolf? Computer generated monsters are NOT scary, they are fantastical. A Werewolf is a fictional extension of a psychopath. Since, In reality, people are the most frightening thing on Earth, psychopathic killers are the most frightening people. A Werewolf is basically a hyper-psychotic, bent on killing and mutilation. It is therefore essential that for a Werewolf to be frightening, or for just about any humanlike monster to be frightening, the monster must be played by an actual human. that is another reason why the monsters in this film are such a disgrace to all the classic monsters of the past. This movie leaves out the human element; an element that must be present for any movie to succeed on ANY level or genre. By the way... since when does a guy turning into a werewolf have the ability to crawl backwards up a wall like Spiderman?",Van Helsing

The actors cannot be blamed, the set designers neither, in fact no artist working on this film can be blamed but the writer and director, which happens to be the same person. Hmmmmm. The Mummy was, I agree slightly better, and I can understand why some thought the Mummy was actually a good movie (I disliked the Mummy almost as much as this).The problem with Van Helsing, is that it drama's up when it is not needed, attempts humor that makes one groan, and tries to cover a poor story with bizarre, supernatural action, that ultimately flops.

First, I really liked seeing this movie, Hugh Jackman is awesome and needs to do more action flicks. There was constant action and though predictable at times, it was funny at times, made you jump once or twice, and was kate beckinsale is a full blown bombshell. Second, the problem I can see that people would have with it is there are unnecessary scenes, like the ending, no spoiler here, but it was a little drawn out. However, to those people I ask what would you have done to make those spots better? I can't really think of much, and I was impressed enough by the rest of the movie to where the little sratches were barely noticable. A huge problem is people forget this is a movie, because I am so sick of hearing ""it's unrealistic"" or whatever. The point of a movie like this is you sorta check out at the door, and hold on for a ride.

The actors were, in my opinion, quite right for their respective roles, and the setting and background of the story could have made for a really nice thriller following up on the Dracula myth and tradition  it could have been taken to epic levels. It seems such a pity having all this at hand and then turning out only a slightly better than average movie  good on the action and spectacular effects, but little more.What went wrong was that the action and effects were prioritised over and above the believability of the characters and story. Too much had to happen too fast with one spectacular scene after another. Instead they should have allowed for some more acting, defining and building up the characters and story. In many scenes there is also an undertone of humour which I find quite annoying. When I watch a thriller I wish to be shocked, scared and thrilled, not having the suspense and atmosphere killed every other minute because the director, producers, finance men or whoever thinks it is oh so trendy for their movie to be like Buffy, Ally, etc. It's like having the dessert mixed into your nice steak dinner - I prefer to have them separately, thank you.I rated this one a 6.",Van Helsing

The special effects were many - perhaps too many we could have done with a little more from Hugh and Kate but the script did not allow this. This was not planned to horrify the viewers it was planned to entertain us and in my case it certainly work. The OTT Dracula was a real laugh, the bad guy turning good [Frankenstein] was a real touch of days gone by - it used to touch the most hardened hearts. We use to love that. Carl {David Wenham - I apologise if I have not spelt this correctly] and Hugh worked together wonderfully. Although Van Helsing and Anna did not really get to know each other intimately I found Hugh did it again - he made me cry with him when Anna died. Gosh he has got such talent, breath taking looks and of course when you go behind the scenes - what a personality as well. But it was apparent there were many people involved in this film all working extremely hard and it was a joy to see so many of the cast and crew getting on so well.

If you were a huge fan of the Ring or Dark Water, this movie is NOT FOR YOU.Basically, it was about Gabriel Van Helsing (Jackman). He goes to Transylvania and meets Anna Velarious (Beckinsale). They aren't exactly the most romantic couple in the entire world. Not enough flaming passion but they clicked pretty well. Dracula's brides, I'd say, are the most impressive. The trio are cool and sexy and all that. And then suddenly, they become flying gargoyles from hell. Dracula (Roxburgh) is not your typical vampire-bat. He can transform into a beast from hell with a 15-feet wingspan. It gave me a new perspective on him. Anyhow, Roxburgh did an excellent job in portraying the Count. Frankenstein (Hensley) is your typical Frankie. Green, flat headed, bolts... yada yada yada. He's this kind freak who wants 'to exist'. Carl (Wenham) is Van Helsing's cute little sidekick.

After having seen West yell ""It's Alive!"" several times, seen Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein Monster wake up, and seen the townsfolk charge up to Frankensteins laboratory with pitchforks, flames and battle rams, we are stunned by Richard Roxburgh's performance as Count Dracula, showing us an amazing, and very different interpretation on Dracula, than we have seen in the past. In the first scene, we see some great visual effects, (it appears to be the same Computer Generated Images as used for the cursed pirates in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"".) Strangely enough, there are no credits, not even a title card, but we do get to see Van Helsings name on a wanted poster in this next scene of the movie. Van Helsing is in Paris, hunting 'Mr Edward Hyde', voiced by the fabulous, Robbie Coltraine, a cannibalistic, Computer Generated character who appears to be at least eight foot tall, separating itself from the Metro Goldwyn Mayer movies (Universal never made a Doctor Jeckyll and Mr Hyde movie as a part of their horror genre), in which Mr Hyde was a short, crippled man. When returning from an action packed fight with Mr Hyde, to a secret society consisting of all the known religions in the world, Van Helsing is given his next assignment, he must go to Transylvania, and kill Count Dracula, before Count Dracula kills the Valerious family, who, if are killed before Dracula is killed, will never enter the gates of heaven.Having established where we stand in this world, and that men can drink potions and become hideous beasts, men can create life via robbing body parts of others, and that vampires exist, we now get to see one of Universals most loved monsters... The Wolf Man. The wolf doesn't charge around on all fours all the time, as the Werewolf does in 'An American Werewolf in London', yet it doesn't always walk around on two legs like the wolf does in films such as 'The Wolf Man' and 'Werewolf of London'. It is a mixture of both. They run and charge at their prey on all fours, yet when they walk they walk around on their hind legs, like a human. The wolves seem to be huge in size, and the speed they run at suggests that no human can outrun them even with a head start.These are not the only characters included in this film from the classics, Igor from Frankenstein, makes a good B villain, and much more characters are included as the story progresses.Alan Slyvestri, the composer of the memorable and powerful music of the Back to the Future films, doesn't let us down, and provides a once-again powerful musical score, with a score you would expect to find in modern movies, and at the same time, gives us music you would find in the Universal Horror Classics.The film displays some excellent acting talents, especially those of Hugh Jackman and Richard Roxburgh. Also, I might add, the visual effects in the film are definitely Industrial Light and Magic, displaying 'their' true talents. They are undoubtedly, the best of the best, when it comes to CGI. Stephen Sommers also shows us some great writing talents and some fantastic shots.This is definitely one of my all time favorite films. Anyone who enjoys a good Universal Horror picture, should watch this.",Van Helsing
625,Morgan-41,Like watching a video game,4,5 December 2006,"Watching this film was like watching two and a half hours of a very loud video game. The crashing, screaming, wailing, howling, shooting, barking, thundering, etc. let up for about 10 minutes total, which made it difficult to understand the (awful) dialogue. It was also so dark (on TV at least) that I could barely see what appeared to be pretty spectacular sets.It's too bad, as I think the idea of the film was great, and it did have some excellent touches. The introductory sequence was a wonderful homage. Richard Roxburgh and the last-to-survive of the wives (not sure which actress she was) added some much-needed verve. There were some interesting aspects to the five-second plot that I wish they had capitalized upon.However, poor Kate Beckinsale, who has been so good elsewhere, was laughable. That outfit! I am a huge Hugh Jackman fan, but even he was not at his best here.",Van Helsing

It's eye candy, folks, pure and simple. All style, with just enough substance to keep it interesting. Hugh Jackman was perfectly cast for the role, as were Beckinsale and Wenham.Without putting in any spoilers, I just wish we'd had a little more of Van Helsing's background, and I'd still love to see Anna in the sequel (and you know there will be one). Wenham's Carl is good comic relief, essentially being Van Helsing's Q for the duration. All three have picked up their roles with gusto, and it shows.Richard Roxburgh is the only real drawback here. His Dracula has no charisma, no seduction, no gravitas, no menace, and no darkness about him. I wonder if the reactions to this movie might have been better if Dracula here had been a little more of the traditional menacing, seductive, dangerous Dracula.To those folks that were expecting accuracy to the literary characters, I'm sorry, but it should have been obvious from the trailers that that wasn't coming. Although, it was one of the more accurate screen representations of Frankenstein's monster to date.All in all, not perfect, but above-average. 7.5/10.",Van Helsing

I knew the movie was in trouble when the Czech movie goers began walking out after 30 minutes into the movie.  My 17 year old son who talked me into going to the movie with him was speechless as we walked out of the theater after two hours of mind numbing sound effects, lame dialogue, incongruent special effects, totally unbelievable stunts, redundant action sequences and the list goes on.  ""Dad, how can Universal spend 150 million dollars and produce such junk?""  ""Son, when your target audience is an 11 year old, what do you expect?""

Who expected this to be another Frankenstein or Dracula? NOBODY! Did anyone here see the other Stephen Sommers movie ""The Mummy""? Fun, campy, silly stuff. That's what I expected and thats what I got. Compared with most uninteresting trash thats out there now at least this entertained me. Don't compare this to the original Frankenstein thats a whole other class of film.

Music to set a mood? Let's have a loud, thundering soundtrack that doesn't let up! Use action to create drama? Let's make a film that is nothing more than one long action sequence from start to finish!  Unfortunately for Sommers, ""more"" comes at the expense of ""less""--almost no character development and a poor script with laughably bad dialog, so what we are left with is a crashing bore.  In a film, the audience must first care about the characters.  Everything else is developed around that--lighting, set design, special effects.  In Van Helsing the set design is beautiful, the action is thrilling, the CGI is dazzling, but who cares? This is a film for which you feel nothing, that is hollow inside.This movie is like a text where EVERYTHING IS TYPED IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS; WHEN EVERYTHING IS EMPHASIZED, THEN NOTHING IS EMPHASIZED. What you are left with is pointless, noisy, frenetic action. The worst film of 2004 without a doubt. I give it 1/10.",Van Helsing
630,mysterlynch,Merchandising hits the big screen,2,9 May 2004,"Van Helsing isn't so much a movie, as it is the beginning of a brand. They have been talking about a TV series, toys, a possible amusement park and various spin offs.The premise for this film was a really promising one. When I first heard about it, I was actually quite excited. I should have known better when they described, in the press, the title character as sort of a medieval ""Black Ops"" agent. Having said that, Van Helsing didn't feel like a real movie. It felt like a bunch of ""neat scenes"" put together. They had some talented actors, but the script was simply atrocious.They took three separate monsters that have all been established draws in their own right and just tossed them all in one show. Not sure who they will dig up for the inevitable sequel. The overall movie was an orgy of bombastic excess. Bigger, better, louder! Ugh!",Van Helsing
631,tworadblue,Good fun,8,7 July 2006,"Van helsing is no where nearly as bad as the Mummy or the Mummy returns and can be great fun if you don't expect serious horror. The CGI is only rarely bad and pretty decent for the most part. The settings and action are excellent. The homage to all the characters of the genre can be appreciated. Dracula comes across as a pathetic individual and you actually feel sad for him. It may drag a teency weency bit but for the most part, its quite enjoyable and thats what movies are supposed to be. Without stuff like these, cinema would be extremely boring. At the same time, most of the parts in this movie have been quite professionally done.",Van Helsing

But about 30 minutes in the movie goes on auto-pilot and the effects completely take over. It seems doubtful taht Hugh Jackman had to do much physically for this film as CG(computer generated) versions of him seem to be doing all the work. I enjoyed the campiness of this film, the supporting cast was great (Richard Roxburgh is great as an over the top Dracula and David Wenham as the bumbling side kick gets most of the laughs) but I felt like I was watching a cartoon. And maybe taht was the whole point, but I'm a little old fashioned and I don't mind some of that new fangled CG stuff to make way for some good IL' traditional stunt work. I think given a smaller budget this movie would have been more then just a 2 hour sense assault.",Van Helsing

Those who are complaining obviously don't understand or know the classic genre of black and white horror that is being recreated here, only with killer CG and wicked fight sequences.Finally someone made a cool and believable were-wolf transformation.You know that's what they're going for right from the opening, and they ride the line expertly. Steven Sommers wasn't ""Overwhelmed"" like a lot of you - "" I was raise on teen horror flick"" Nay sayers are spouting off about. Sommers used classic villains and classic story telling all the way through. From the expository ""Let's recap who we all are and what we all do"" scene, to villagers too stupid for their own good and Gremlin esque demon children. Yes I laughed, but I jumped in my seat a couple times too. I loved this film. I should note I hated Underworld with a passion. If you love classic horror flicks you'll love this film. It will definitly get a cult following, and it's super entertaining. It's classic.To those who didn't like it, get out of your basement and rent some classic horror flicks instead of ""She's all That"".",Van Helsing

Sure, it lacked a few things, but it's better than sitting and watching a remake of Dracula. I mean come on, you get the Wolfman too! There isn't a better movie than having the Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein. Then you'v got great actors and a good director, Hugh Jackman who's Wolverine from X-Men, Kate Beckinsale from The Underworld Series, David Wenham who's really popular in Australia, Shuler Hensley who's a great guy on Broadway, and a whole a lot of other people who were able to put this together.

Its wasn't the story that fell so short, it was all the details of movie making. The 150-200 million dollar film wastes most of that money on cheesy and unneeded special effects. When the vampires open their mouths they look more like cartoon opposums, and Dracula himself looks like an evil 1980s (U2's) Bono, complete with visible hair clip (don't worry his acting is worse). Not only that, the production company couldn't fit an even halfway mediocre screenwriter into its aircraft carrier size budget as the entire script probably took up one typed page, if you think I'm joking go see the movie.

Like Underworld, it deals with vampires, werewolves, and monster hunters with hi-tech weapons, and like Underworld, it generally cares more about those things than plot or characterization. However, while I was able to enjoy the first Underworld as a stylish comic book good time, Van Helsing gets so lost in a storm of wall-to-wall action and cartoonish CGI that it's usually more disorienting and confusing than thrilling or exciting, and the plot makes no sense whatsoever. The performances are too good for the script and some inspired moments show up here and there, including the brilliant black-and-white sequence, but overall, this creature feature was a bloody mess.",Van Helsing

The villains that Van Helsing fights in this movie are, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Count Dracula, Frankenstein Monster, Dracula's Three Brides, and some Werewolves. So much action. Too they didn't make as much as they had anticipated. It had a huge budget of $160 million and it made domestically about $120 million. It was very entertaining. It had great action scenes.

It's involuntarily funny up to a point but a deep sense of boredom settled in with me after half an hour or so and never left me until the end, which seemed very long to come. Some people go for special effects, which has never been sufficient for me to like a film, special effects without any other redeeming qualities is just total emptiness. Combining all the monsters that ever existed is pretty silly although it's been done before many times in equally forgettable old horror flicks. By the way, what is Dr. Jekill doing on the top of Notre-Dame de Paris since that's an English story? But why quibble with details in such a mess.",Van Helsing

The Werewolves in this movie looked Awesome! I went into this movie figuring that it was just another movie about Dracula and that the other two monster stars would just be small side characters, boy was I wrong. The movie plot does surround Dracula but the other two monsters really get plenty of screen time, especially the Wolf Man. I don't want to give away the plot of the film but it does have a bit of a surprise to it, and being a major werewolf fan I'll just say I was very happy with the surprise. To all those who love monster movies and especially you werewolf fans this is one movie you don't want to miss. I give it an A+ rating.

Yes, it is loud and there is a few silly moments but pretty much every movie has those and No, it doesn't dwell much on character development, but why would you want it to, it's a freaking monster movie not Gone With The Wind. So just leave your brain at the door, sit back and hang on for the ride. I give this film an A+ or a 9 out of 10.PS: As I was leaving the theater I never heard one negative thing said about this movie, it was a full house and everyone I overheard talking was praising the movie so don't believe all the negative crap you read some people would complain about anything.

And to be honest, it wasn't the 'interpretation' of Dracula and Van Helsing that got me.No - it was the God-awful excuse for a plot, terrible CGI, some hideous 'acting' from certain quarters.  Jackman appeared to be almost the only cast memberwho even attempted to act, while Beckinsale was apparently under theimpression that her job was to make fun of Romanians.  It was the blatantplagiarism from every other movie ever made, from Shrek to The Lion King toThe Matrix. Seriously. And I strongly believe that an actor of Hugh Jackman's calibre deserved a better film than this one to launch him as somebody capable of carrying a whole film on his shoulders. And yet, after all that, it never intended itself to be taken seriously. I suppose it is mildly entertaining, the ultimate B-movie, as it was put. If you go in with no expectations, you won't come out disappointed. Maybe I should go again,knowing what's coming, forgetting that I waited months for this and remembering that yes, some of the laughs in the cinema were unintentional and came out of such things as a kiss more wooden than the one in Attack of the Clones, butsome came out of genuine jokes in the film.

For the entire movie I could not take my eyes away from the screen and it captivated me for the whole two hours. It is action packed and the actors did a terrific job of portraying their characters. My particular favorite was David Wenham. Definitely a big difference from playing Faramir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" and I give him props for that. I have no complaints whatsoever concerning the movie although I do have to say this: I was very upset when I heard people talking about how the special effects looked fake.

Well, it was just about at the Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde scene that we turned on the car and left. It was mainly because of all the CGI, we just didn't like it. Well, here we are several months later, and we decide to give it a second try, so we went out and rented it last night. Well, we made it past the scene that we stopped at previously, but it was right after Van Helsing fights off the three badly CGI'd vampires and kills one, that I rolled over and went to sleep. The storyline was painful, there was more computer created characters than in Shrek, and the scenes were badly written. If someone were to ask me if they should watch this, I would STRONGLY recommend not doing so.I had real hopes for this film, as I am a huge Universal Monsters fan, but it strongly disappointed me.However, this is only my opinion, however strong it may be.

The film starts with him getting chucked over a bridge by Jekyll n Hyde monster. Van Helsing gets a job to kill Count Dracula before he kills the last two remaining valerious family. The valerious family have been trying to kill Dracua unsuccessfully for centuries. The brother of Anna valerius tries to kill Dracula but gets trapped and turned into a werewolf.

Even the movie premiere was aptly timed with a full moon.If only the movie was just as good as the marketing department.Even an almost-bare bodied Jackman and corset-wrapped Beckinsale could not save the movie. Set in the late 19th century when vampires, werewolves, gnomes and the Frankenstein monster roamed, Van Helsing was a cross between League of Extraordinary Gentlemen and James Bond, but less camp, less ingenious, more bore. The 2 hours and 15 minutes were filled with razzle-dazzle effects and cheap scare tactics, mostly found in B-grade movies. The worst were the out-of-the-world swinging around a rope -- makes you wonder if director Stephen Sommers had been watching too much Spiderman.The saving grace came in the form of David Welham.

And the first quarter-hour of ""Van Helsing"" (""V.H."") starts off promisingly, in Paris, with our hero battling Mr. Hyde (Dr. Jekyll's alter ego) in Notre Dame cathedral. Granted, some liberties have been taken with the Parisian geography and Notre Dame's architecture, but who cares? I wanted to see a big, over-the-top movie, and ""V.H."" is certainly that. But, like Count Dracula, it has no heartbeat, no real soul. (How's that for an analogy, eh?) It's one gravity-defying set piece after another. I found myself thinking about the last generation of movies and movie-goers: If you were in the ticket queue and you overheard someone coming out of the theater saying ""Weren't the locations in the film beautiful?"", you knew that the person was looking for something nice to say because film itself was a stinker. Instead we now say ""Weren't the effects fantastic?"" And indeed, the combination of motion capture and keyframe animation - especially when the brides of Dracula swoop in to terrify the poor Transylvanian villagers who must live with not only vampires but also werewolves and - for a time - Dr. Frankenstein (who leaves his misunderstood ""monster"" behind) as well. (Why don't these people move?) I felt particularly sorry for Jackman: It's one thing to play the strong, silent type, but it's quite another to not have enough material to really (pardon the pun) sink your teeth into. And I don't believe I'm spoiling the film by saying that in the climactic fight scene finale, he's hardly seen: His digital double does all the heavy lifting. But in a way this was the logical conclusion, since throughout the film almost all the other main characters appeared to enjoy themselves more than V.H.--even if they were often guilty of chewing the scenery (again, sorry about the pun). So my advice would be as follows: Want to see Hugh Jackman? Watch ""X-Men 2"". Kate Beckinsale? Go for a little film called ""Shooting Fish"". In the meantime, I've heard that there will probably be a ""V.H. 2"", and why not? When your enemy is the undead you can go on and on and on....",Van Helsing

I saw it last night on preview and lemme say first off, I don't give a toss what the critics think - or those who continue to diss the movie before even seeing it. I, personally, went for Kate and for what I got of her, it left me with a tingling, warm fuzzy sensation. I thought the whole movie, overall was fun. that's what I went for. Mindless fun. Some entertainment on a Thursday night. LXG this movie was not. And thank god.So basic overview of the plot - Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man set out to rid the world of evil do-ers. He becomes the most wanted man in Europe after killing Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde in his opening scenes in Paris. Then he is sent on a mission to Romania to help the Valerious family defeat the legendary count, Dracula (an unimpressive Richard Roxborough). All the Valerious clan has been killed and it's two remaining descendents are Velkan (Will Kemp) and his sister, Princess Anna (Kate Beckinsale). Working together, they set about to eliminate Dracula and his three vampire brides in a bid to help each desceased member of the Valerious family get into the gates of heaven.The sets and scenery were fantastic, really impressive. Likewise are the Wolfman transformations. Will Kemp is absolutely goregous; definately a rising star. The Friar character is essentially, the movie's only form of humor - which was lacking a bit. Even when Van Helsing tried to employ his own humor, it kinda backfired...quite a number of the audience laughed at the Friar's lines/un-intended puns and jokes - and we had a full audience.Casting wise; I don't think Roxbourgh cuts it as the legendary foe. I fear this man will become a typecast for bad guys; i) the duke in 'Moulin Rouge' and ii) the bad guy in last year's truely rotten 'League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'... Likewise with the three vampire brides - I found them to be irritiating. Whenever they laughed, it was like screeching. And that sound in the cinema is NOT a good thing. The bride effects, when they were in the air and flying around and whatnot were, for me, a real let down. Unlike the wolfman effects, they were unconvincing. I found that with Stephen Sommers' last movie, 'The Mummy Returns'. The brides are Van Helsing's equivalent of the Scorpion King beast. Sommers, at times, relies on too much CGI and it, suffice to say, kills his movies.I much preferred the aforementioned Wolfman scenes and the make up on Frankenstein's monster. One thing that really irked me - Kevin O'Conner, who plays the very hunchback-y Igor. You may remember him as Benny, the little weed in 'The Mummy' - he esentially has no part.As for Jackman - I love him, a lot, but I hope he sticks with Wolverine as his stand out performance. I didn't really form an opinion on him as the male lead, but he has so much charm and charisma - who cares how he acted on the screen?I loved Anna to bits. I think after the Friar, she was my favourite character. Simply because of who is playing her: Kate Beckinsale. First off, I loved the accent...some reviewer said she sounded too much like some character in the 'Rocky and Bullwinkle' cartoon - having never seen that, I can't compare. It was campy but I loved it. I found myself smiling at every scene she was in...chuckling to myself with the accent - she does it so well. Never falters once.In my opinion, the majority of thespians struggle with accents other than their own. Prime example being Colin Farrell in 'American Outlaws'...his Irish keeps drifting in when he talks and hey, wasn't Jesse James an american? Rachel Weisz has that similiar problem [though not quite as bad as Farrell's]. While I love Beckinsale's fellow English compatriot; she doesn't do so well with American...Beckinsale does the transylvanian/romanian accent very well. Likewise when she portrays an American in her other movies.In a nut shell - Beckinsale shimmers. She sizzles. She dazzles. She sparkles. She's glowing. All that good stuff. I found it quite entertaining that three or four guys, who were seated in front of me, kept going on about how hot she was. When she has her first scene in the movie, one of them turned to his friend and just uttered a single ""f*cking hell""...you can imagine what that was aimed at...For me, a defining scene is definately the masquerade ball - that's all I'm saying. Loved the close relationship Anna has with Velkan. I felt a little sorry for the character in some scenes - there are times where she really gets beaten about. Falling over things, falling through things - i felt Sommers was almost taking the mick out of a very intelligent Beckinsale; making the character seem clumsy. But hey, Beckinsale all sweaty and punched out is quite a turn on.Final thoughts; go see this movie if you want. Don't let the critics get you downhearted. Form your own opinion on it - I did.Rating: *** out of ***** (Maybe pushing it for four stars; solely on the grounds of a dazzling Beckinsale)",Van Helsing
654,MemnochZERO,"If You're in the mood to watch Kate Beckinsale and Hugh Jackman fight practically every monster, or enjoy the work of Stephan Sommers, see it, if not...",9,7 May 2004,"I must start out by saying something about this movie; it is NOT for everyone. There are elements here that for some people will just not gel. What we have here is not a horror film, but an adventure movie with monsters, that said, there may be minor spoilers here. It was really different from what I thought it was going to be. Originally I expected it to be a story about Van Helsing. THE Dr. Abraham Van Helsing of Bram Stoker's novel. Secondly I expected it to be a really dark horror movie. What I found was, it was more of an adventure/action movie with horror characters, this is because it's a Stephan Sommers film, the dude that did the Mummy films. In Van Helsing, essentially he took these horror characters/monsters and then created his own bigass story. Van Helsing really isn't the Van Helsing of the Dracula novel, but a monster hunter of a similar name (Gabriel Van Helsing, not a doctor). I think you really have to walk into that movie knowing this won't be a film that purely reflects any of the stories that inspired it. Such characters as Dr. Jekyll/Mr Hyde, Victor Frankenstein and his Monster, Igor, the wolfman, even Dracula and Van Helsing are almost recreated specifically for this film. As I said, Van Helsing exists purely as a monster killing tool, he isn't a professor or anything like that, much as the other monsters exist in this movie for the purpose of him eradicating with them in some manner, mostly killing them with a variety of Blade-type weapons. It's a monster movie without being a horror movie. It's visually dark, yet maintains the light adventure nature of the Mummy films. This may or may not be a bad thing, depending on what you want to see. I think given what this film was going to be about, it all fit together surprisingly well. I mean, I was rather worried about how all these characters would all fit into a 2 hour movie without being ridiculous like the always s****y 'Street Fighter', and what I found was rather cohesive, and at the very least, entertaining. Of course this film would've worked perfectly had it solely been about Van Helsing and Dracula without the other monsters, and could've truly embraced the dark horror element, but went in the direction of the Mummy.As far as casting goes, Hugh Jackman is easily the next badass of action films, and we even get some Wolverinesque moments. Kate Beckinsale rules as always, though her accent in the film, as most characters, isn't as convincing as it could be. Regardless of this, she not only kicks ass, but looks great doing it. Casting wise, the more interesting thing, for me anyway, is to see David Wenham playing a character so far removed from Faramir (Lord Of The Rings). He was quiet, shy, and even his posture felt small. His character was said to be about 5'7"", meanwhile he in real life is 5'11"" yet his posture and acting pulled it off completely. His character was also cowering behind Jackman for most of the movie so that might've had something to do with it. Another great turn in the casting was Kevin J. O'Connor (also from The Mummy) as Igor. Though visually unrecognizable, his voice and acting filtered through his make up and just put a big smile on my face. Without getting into the plot too much, I will say this; I enjoyed the portrayal of the Frankenstein Monster. Unlike what most movies have done, they showed him for what he was. He wasn't evil, he was just a monster. He didn't ask to be made, but yet he was. The debate over the right for him as an individual to exist is addressed quite nicely in the film. Van Helsing, a man who exists to destroy monsters even sees he is not evil even when Anna (Beckinsale) and Carl (Wenham) cannot. Now, besides the fact that I REALLY wanted to be watching a badass horror movie and didn't get that, I did have other problems with the film. Namely, the insane use of CGI. I understand with a film in a setting like this, CGI is needed, that's great, I accept that. However, the unnecessary use of it really can kill a film. I love a CGI character as much as anyone else (go Sméagol) but the extent to which it is used for nearly every creature in the film actually really annoyed me. The thing with using mad CGI is that you see so much of it in a frame that it no longer becomes movie magic, but just a lazy effect. Some films do it great, like the Lord Of The Rings films or X2 (go Nightcrawler sequence), and some films really can't master it in full, like The Hulk, or even the first Spiderman. The effects in this film essentially use the same style of the Mummy creatures, and transplant them onto vampires and werewolves, and Mr Hyde. Sure it's great I guess, but it starts to take away from the film after so much of it is used. Not to mention, the vampires got progressively predictable as the wanted to feed because their mouths kept extending much like the warrior mummies in The Mummy Returns. I've always been impressed with great makeup and prosthetics and this film kinda bummed me out at the fact some great monsters were reduced complete CGI trash. While Frankenstein's Monster was pure makeup, the werewolf was all computer, and it bugged the Hell out of me. There was so much potential here, but it was wasted. I did enjoy the way Dracula and his Brides were represented in their pure vampire form though CGI, well, more the Brides, Dracula looked rather tacky at times, specifically in the end. But my favourite parts of the film only were about a minute, maybe, combined, but did make it interesting. No movie before that I've seen has attempted and succeeded in representing werewolf or vampire sight, this film does. The werewolf point of view shots are very animalistic, blurry and black and white, and really put you into its head. The vampire sight is something I've only read in books. As much as vampire movies try to illustrate how vampires see different, it has never been shown. Even the Anne Rice novels which go to great detail to describe this, weren't translated into the films based on them. This film does it and does it well.  We finally see what a vampire sees as it hunts in the dark. It's wonderful. In any case, the film probably isn't for everyone. If you want to watch Kate Beckinsale and Hugh Jackman beat the s**t out of almost every major monster in literature and classic film, and/or appreciate the work of Stephan Sommers, see it. If not.. well, chances are you'll leave less than impressed.",Van Helsing
655,pink-crazy-chick,genuinely spectacular,10,1 May 2011,"If I could give this film 11 stars then I would. I think it is absolutely amazing and keeps you on your toes throughout. The contrast between the different scenes is perfect along with the characters and acting. I really love this film because it surprises you and doesn't turn out as you would expect. It is definitely not a predictable film in my opinion. It also does well not to confuse its audience as so much is going on throughout the film. I also think the special effects are brilliant and you forget they're not real. If you don't know the whole Dracula and Frankenstein thing then this film gives you an overall view of it. It has everything a good film needs with romance, violence, excitement and adventure. It is definitely worth a watch whenever you can as it is genuinely spectacular.",Van Helsing
656,koliokolev,"incredible camera, Jackman at his best",8,15 May 2004,"Got into the theatre by chance and went in only to see Hugh Jackman in one more movie, but didn't regret a second. The action grabs you from the first second to the last. Excellent camera work, compares only with LOTR and Hulk, but here it is a 2 and a half hour non-stop swirling and jumping and what-not. Costumes and cast are excellent. Hugh Jackman confirmed he is a good actor, and all the rest are fine. Minor complaints - at times the animation is not seamless, and action is just a bit too much. Warning - don't see it if you scare easily. No doubt one of the best movies for the year. Much better than Troy anyway. 8/10",Van Helsing
657,Platypus-Man,Boring,4,7 May 2004,"Good thing - I was prepared for it, after seeing LXG. Bad thing - it was worse than I expected.It's impossible to spoil anything, because they already did that with trailers. Actually the movie was like a 2-hour long trailer - action following action following action. And when the characters had time to open their mouths, I was practically begging them to stop. I couldn't help noticing people around the theater moaning ""oh my god, he really said that"" or ""they really did that"". So, the story sucked. And when that happens, people start to notice the poor over-used CGI. Well didn't we all see it coming after watching ""The Mummy Returns""? What makes me really sad, is when we pay money to see these movies (like I did), producers think we like that kind of **** and produce some more of the same. Actors did all they could with the material, but Stephen Sommers gets a big Boo from me!4 / 10 (for sound effects and background music)",Van Helsing
658,nefretu,Brilliant - a different take on the world,10,7 May 2004,"I saw this movie last night and I have to say it was not what I had expected it to be. The vampires in the movie, especially the females are all very annoying and I prefer my vampires to be more seductive and suave ( like Underworld ). This was the part that I did not expect. However, the movie itself was just brilliant. Van Helsing was well acted and a great caracter. The story unfolds with a twist I had not seen coming. The story is not easy to understand, so I can understand that some people might not get the hints in the movie. You actually need to pay attention to the details to get to know what is going on. That is what made the movie special. The universe created was just brilliant and well drawn and the special effects were superb. Of course, everyone would recognize the familiar caracters from LXG and The Mummy, but that should not be a bad thing. The movie is originial and has an interesting new take on the van Helsing caracter we all know from books and movies such as Dracula. I definitly prefer this version and I would recommend watching this movie to everyone who likes dark movies that are different ( see the not so happy ending ). I hope the make a sequel and tie up the still open story lines.",Van Helsing
659,Patriot99,"A flamboyant disaster, a huge insult to the horror/action genre",1,25 June 2005,"Van Helsing honors classic horror films just as Space Balls honors Star Wars. It seems that Hollywood loves to release these ""trick"" films where you expect to see some amazing horror/action flick but instead you get a goofy slap stick mess like Van Helsing. The PG-13 rating is your first warning as Director Stephen Sommers displays his true flamboyance as he uses almost every classic monster to tell this mess of a story in a toned down goofy fashion.Although it advertises ""Awesome Horror"" Van Helsing features almost no blood in the entire film, Sommers is such a bad director it isn't even funny, the use of CGI for the monsters and special effects is down right incompetent, the portrayal of Dracula and his brides is so badly acted you wont believe your ears. And the script to get all these monsters together in one film is far from clever because when you finally learn the story and its twists, you will wonder what idiot approved the Script. Stephen Sommers clearly cant be stopped, his next projects include a ""Flash Gordon"" adaptation. His clear flamboyance and incompetence as a director can no longer be avoided. Do your self a favor and skip Van Helsing and check out ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" with Anthony Hopkins as a flawless Van Helsing indeed.",Van Helsing

At first I decided to give it a chance because I was being nagged by my brother. I love Hugh so it was worth it. Then, in the very beginning we meet Richard Roxburgh's Dracula character. He was so wonderful in the film. I was instantly drawn into this movie. I found myself actually liking Dracula and rooting for him the whole time.Maybe it's just me, but it's Dracula that makes the show and that has led to me watching this movie over and over and over again.So, give it a chance, you might just find yourself enjoying this movie, regardless of what other people say.",Van Helsing

With all his cool weapons and his ""ready for broadway"" monster fighting outfit -Hugh Jackman as Peter Allen is definitely one bad Mother!  This movie has it all! Highly choreographed dance numbers, great tunes, fabulous costumes and of course, Jackman as Peter Allen - the ultimate song and dance man cum vampire fighting machine - evincing danger and careless world weariness with every move.

663,US_Ken_Fan,"How can it be ""just OK""...when the middle is pretty good, but the end ROTS?",2,22 May 2004,"The scriptwriter apparently began with EXCELLENT ideas...bring several classic horror characters together, create clever mythology to tie the classic ideas together, and create a whole new SERIES of plot twists! If Dracula is not the least bit spooky, this can still make for some pretty good entertainment, right? WRONG!The beginning of the film impressed me for several reasons; A, the ""myth-twisting"" began right then, and it was pretty darn inventive without being the least bit comical or insulting to the original stories; B, even though the effects looked 100% early-90s (not realistic and very overdone, even laughable), having it shot in black-and-white (or was it done in the editing room?) seemed to balance that out...I could have enjoyed the entire movie that way, though scaling back on the special effects would have made it more realistic and therefore convincing; and C, beginning this movie with a tribute to classic ""Frankenstein"" woven DIRECTLY with the myth-twisting was a true inspiration! But ""Van Helsing"" never delivers.Let me begin with my #1 complaint: I cannot think of ANY TYPE OF MOVIE that can benefit by giving its viewers pounding headaches, but that's exactly what you get! Every scrape of the sword, every swoop, punch, breakage, thump, shout, or bit of movement in this film is ramped up to full volume, with no discernable purpose. If you want to see ""Van Helsing"" after reading this (if you're looking for a way to waste your money), do yourself a BIG favor...bring Tylenol...LOTS of TYLENOL! The only thing equally annoying is the constant banshee-screaming of the many comical female vampires. This headache is really getting to me now! WHY, OH WHY, DIDN'T I BRING TYLENOL?Considering that every creature in this film looks like it belongs on a special Halloween edition of ""Nickolodeon"", the action manages to be somewhat impressive at the start, even if it's not the least bit convincing. The action almost NEVER stops...it's the fastest 2 hours and 20 minutes I've ever spent at the movies (even faster than ""The Last Samurai"", which had a LOT quality elements between the few hugely impressive sequences)...so this must mean it's at least a very good movie, right? WRONG AGAIN! An hour after this movie has ended, my heart is still pounding...in tune to my head. By the way, did I mention I had a headache?Dracula is thin, ugly and whiny, wears an earring, and isn't the least bit spooky. If you think it's impossible to turn the most charismatic, human, and seductive evil creature of all time into a wimpy, white-faced mupped, THINK AGAIN! I would criticize the acting, except that no one is EVER given a chance to act. Maybe he spends too much time with his many banshee-vampiresses. Maybe he has a headache...did I say headache?More than halfway through this movie, I still thought I would have rated it ""very good"" (maybe 6 or 7, depending how it turned out), simply because the (good) plot slowly unravelled through the film seemed to hint towards a good or possibly better ending. The involvement of a certain religious element with Van Helsing (I'll leave at that, to avoid spoiling what good points there are), was kind of unique, if a little Star Trekkish. In spite of all my complaints (the biggest at this point was still my unanticipated need for Tylenol), several elements still surprised me in a good way. Although, in predictable Hollywood style, the heroine's beauty must be at least equal to her brains and she must fall halfway out of her (inappropriate for her line of work) clothing, this film surprises by giving the most unexpected genius plan totally to the female...not just some hooky swordwork, not just a moment of mild intelligence or bravery in support of our ""real"" (male) hero, but an awesome plan unknown to both the viewer and every male in the film. I thought that was pretty cool. And there's not even any sex, sexual comments, heck, I'm trying to remember if there's even a swear. Things must be looking up, right? WRONG!Maybe part of the problem is that in the process of twisting together and expanding on the mythologies of several classic monsters, the scriptwriter wrote himself right into a corner. Still, one would think that someone who had the brains to create these ideas would be able to keep some level of suspense through the end of the film. Let's just say that, if this film had a song with lyrics in its soundtrack, country crooner Martina McBride's ""Wrong Again"" would have been entirely appropriate. I know it's possible to reveal the plot ending/solution, ahead of time when necessary and still create a great ending through style and pacing alone...it's been done enough times...but IT DOESN'T HAPPEN HERE. As soon as the Friar figures out the ""solution"", it's ALL downhill. ALL. Everybody connected with the film must have given up, because almost every ""tight spot"" is escaped by crazy coincidence if not complete accident! Forget brains, forget skill...heck, forget brawn! This ""solution"" (which is the missing link in all this myth-weaving) seems to hint at a darn good ending. You can just forget it!""Van Helsing"" seems to think it can deliver soley on the strength of loud noises, fast (if ridiculous) action, and cartoonish CGI. If you have teenage boys whose sole means of rating a movie is how many times the hero can swing a sword or throw a punch per minute of film...they will still hate this movie! I know this for a fact, because the ones next to me kept making references to the need for a commercial break from about the first 40 minutes through the end of the movie. During the raging, volume-pumped (yeah, they upped it again) 30-minute ""climax"" (NOT!), several sarcastic yawns floated my way.

What happens when they are thrown into a pot along with a bankable star and some CGI? S**t happens.

666,nastik09,"Ok, so call me cheesy!",5,6 May 2004,"But I liked the movie. Sommers returns after quite a long absence with a groundbreaking kind of a film. A perfect popcorn movie. A total 'you'll have fun seeing it!' flick. Of course not to forget that seeking any sense in this movie is totally useless, for you will not find it. What you will find though is a good shaken plot, with a wonderful WETA Digital special effects olive, in a perfectly clear Hollywood pre-summer blockbusters glass (still waiting for 'Troy' and 'The Day After Tomorrow'). So, what's it all about? Van Helsing, the man with a mission to kill the all existing evil, is sent to Romania to take on his greatest challenge ever - Count Dracula. What he doesn't know is that this task will be more than just challenging. I won't re-tell the story, though, you just got to see it for yourself.
Having Hugh Jackman on board is a great plus to the movie. Despite the fact that he somehow reminds me of the good old Rick O'Connell of 'The Mummy'. But in a good way, not that he copies him, he feels like a relative. Jackman delivers his edgy side, familiar to the fans of X-Men (Wolverine is my favorite), but all the same with grace and razorblade sharp phrases along with the weapons. His assistant - the geeky-looking Carl, monch-to-be, played by David Wenham (LOTR fans - ye be warned, brace yourselves, no sign of noble Faramir there), is Van Helsing's sidekick, who's there to break the tension after every major action scene with a funny thing he says or does. Kate Beckinsale - the girl still has her rough skills from 'Underworld', where she also dealt with vampires, but was on their side.  Richard Roxburgh - the always pale, always hungry Count Dracula, who has an evil plan to destroy our world, which isn't news to any of the viewers.
In short: the movie is packed with clichees, most of it is CGI, the story about the Dracula is nearly as old as the cinema itself and some moments are predictable for any fan of the genre. So why go and see it? Because the movie has its own charm, the typical Sommers touch. Because it made me feel like a child, such a fairytale-feeling it gave me. Because it fits action, romance and great plot twists along with the last battle, which I didn't see coming the way it did into the 2+ hours, which fly like the Brides of Dracula. So, relax, get yourself a bucket of popcorn, some Coke and let Van Helsing take you into his world of 1888, when good fought with evil in the name of God.",Van Helsing

The opening crowd sequence is superb, done in black and white for added effect and pays homage to the old Frankenstein movies.
From there the plot <coughs> moves on at some pace. In fact if you drew a really big breath you could probably tell the whole plot in one sentence and not go blue in the face but hey, I'm not complaining. The accents are acceptable but I think they paid too much attention to sounding Romanian rather than actually acting so it's a bit ropey in that department. I don't really think Kate Beckinsale got the part for her acting though.It's not really a horror film, it's not really a spoof, its somewhere in between and that is it's major flaw.

Some very slick and scary effects though, with all the characters transformations visually stunning. But there is SO much visual assault that 1/2 way through i found it boring and senseless.

The whole film is carried by the effects, and it's seems to me it's made on exactly the same computer as the extraordinary League Of Gentlemen. I did miss the Gothic aspects very much, for this being a side step of the fantastic and ever inspiring Dracula story. All together I had a good time, over two hours (!!) and a good laugh as well. Some parts were on the border of being romantic or cornball, I choose for the best intention. Storywise it definitly could have been made better, but then again, it could have been done worse as well. See it for yourself, as it is worthwhile.",Van Helsing
672,pimp_ck_2,Wow! - Spoilers,6,10 May 2004,"i saw this movie Saturday and it was one of the years best movies or one of the best movies of all time! The special effects blew me away and i can not believe how awesome the movie was. i would give this movie ten out of ten stars. Kate Beckansale is one of the hottest actresses i have seen in a movie (besides Halle berry) but Kate and Hugh were the perfect on screen duo for this film. i am going to go see this movie again and surely will buy it when it comes out on video. the best scene in the movie is at the END when Van Helsing is fighting Dracula! I was really surprised to see that in the beginning of the movie it was in black and white, but like i said 10 out of 10!",Van Helsing
673,pimp_ck_2,AWESOME!!!!!!!!,6,11 May 2004,"WOW this is one heck of a movie! absolutely worth your money to watch and i know i will see it again.  Hugh jackman and kate were the perfect on screen action partners!  9 out of 10 stars!!  the effects are really what make the movie but the plot is pretty interesting too. There were a couple of moments when i was surprised and almost fell out of my seat!  My favorite character was the ""friar"" lol he was funny!  my favorite monster in the show was the werewolf but it was almost a tie between the werewolf and count dracula. n e ways it was AWESOME!!!!!!!  if there is a movie out there like it i want to know so i can watch it.

674,gothic-2,Battlefield Earth just lost the only reason to be memorable. Van Helsing is even worst.,1,8 May 2004,"First of all I'd like to clear some things up about me. I am a major sci-fi, horror and fantasy fan. I loved X-Men 1 & 2, I thought that no one could play my fave character Wolverine better than Hugh Jackman. I liked Underworld since I am a fan of Whitewolf, I love dark settings and Kate Beckinsale was out of this world. I also enjoyed both Mummies. They are fun, with a basic plot and enjoyable characters. What I call a perfect pop-corn movie. Watching the trailer of Van Helsing, I hoped that I would see another enjoyable pop-corn movie with two good actors.DAMN I WAS WRONG.It would take me hours to describe why this movie was the first one in lots of years that was begging me to leave the building running and screaming in agony.The script is a big hole. It's as simple and chaotic as a bad dream you may have after eating a big steak for dinner and you haven't digested well. My best guess is that it was still being written while they were filming it and they were adding random scenes to it.A few things I can remember. The monk Q (James Bond), part of a secret society in Vatican that shelters Buddhist explosive experts, Mormon weapon designers and Muslims testing CHAINGUNS, tours VH through the latest weaponry, showing him some cool explosive he came up with and the flash bomb he just discovered that emits sunlight but can't find a use for it (Blade and James Bond rip-off in one scene, wow).Frankenstein is a cuddly bear with british accent (did he pick that up in Romania Cambridge school?), Dracula (or T-1000 judging from the way he walks out of fire) could as well be an American Pie character (he's THAT silly), his helpers are Ewoks/Dwarves (where is Snow-white or Luke?) with Slipknot/Sand People masks, his brides are always posing (waving their hands and bodies in a stupid way) when trying to act just like in old b/w movies with no sound, everyone has a stupid Romanian accent, everyone is acting worst than soap operas (including Jack and Kate). You'll see everyone jumping through wires and falling on the ground without a scratch (a lot like Spiderman, including the camera movement), you'll see Dracula's children straight out of Gremlins, you'll notice their hives resembling the Matrix ""human batteries"", you'll laugh at the 10 arrows/sec crossbow, you'll scream ""yo ho ho"" when the horses and carriage fly over a broken bridge and I am sure I am still forgetting lots of things. It's not bad to the point of making you laugh, it's bad to the point of making you angry.I swear, there were people around me who fell asleep at some point.Ed Wood would be proud of his followers (or perhaps just laugh at them). You have to see it to believe how awful it is...",Van Helsing
675,MONGOMAULER,It Sucked,1,9 May 2004,"Too Loud, too much cartoonish special effects and not enough dialogue. Underworld was a better movie than this. League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was better. You don't screw around with classics like this. Frankensteins' Monster was in fact a Monster, a dumb and mostly kind monster but still a monster. In this movie he had better lines than anybody else, he even talked better, and those accents !! God where did they come up with those. The Mr Hyde looked like the very same Mr Hyde from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, at any rate very little difference. And the ending......arghhhhh it was awful.  This movie had the same crappy CGI that HULK had.  Well I guess for those of you new generation people who have never read the classic novels or watched any of the classic movies and have never seen a movie withour a ton of stupid special effects it may be okay. But not for me. I did like most of the settings and at least Van Helsing looked cool, but he wouldnt have gotten far without his sidekick.",Van Helsing
676,emikulina,"Clever, funny and visually impressive",8,18 May 2004,"'Van Helsing' is currently playing in Russian theatres and I already saw it two times. Reason #1: it is very cleverly done - with lots of context from other movies and books of this sort - starting with 'Frankenstein' and all the 'Draculas' and ending with such recent things as 'James Bond' and 'X-Men' (natural, as it too has Hugh Jackman). Reason #: it is very funny - the dialogue and, again, the context in which protagonists find themselves. Special effects are impressive as well. Acting is not really in option in such films, but Hugh Jackman is good and sexy, and Roxbourgh makes for a very unusual Dracula. Camera work is good as well - moody and professional, a little bit like in 'Sleepy Hollow'. And the whole movie certainly leaves you romantically exited - all these jumps, fights and full-moon transformations make one think as one is a teenager again. Clever, funny and visually impressive film - at LEAST 7/10!",Van Helsing
677,rhernandez914,If you like monsters and .....,10,29 May 2004,"Van HelsingDirected by Stephen Sommers Runtime: 132 min If you like monsters and attractive women, this is the movie to see! I was a little surprised by all the negative reviews of this movie. The things I read to paraphrase were brain dead unbelievable, bad acting and characterization and too much special effects etc. Brain Dead? If you go to a movie with Dracula, the Wolfman and Frankenstein planning to see something believable or profound, you have to be brain dead!Bad acting and characterization? As someone said before, have you ever heard of a spoof, or a parody? Can you really try to take this movie so seriously when it should be obvious to one and all that the director intended it to be a parody of all the old horror movies.Too much special effects? The special effects are very impressive but a little to fast moving. Besides, what is wrong with a lot of special effects?If you are way too anal and go to a movie for a little fun instead of the meaning of life, I guess it has too many fantastic special effects. I believe this movie was intended to be a very fun picture to watch and not a critically acclaimed movie for the ages.The best way to describe this movie is a young Indiana Jones Van Helsing meets Dracula, the Wolfman and Frankenstein. Hugh Jackman plays the Indiana Jones like Van Helsing character with skill bringing a funny and amusing hero character to the movie.Kate Beckinsale plays the Xena like heroine Anna Valerious. She is the very sexy and strong woman character (with a bad accent) who is pivotal to the success of defeating Dracula. Richard Roxburgh plays a credible (if not overly dramatic) Count Dracula.David Wenham plays the comic genius Friar side-kick of Van Helsing by the name of Carl. Shuler Hensley plays a credible Frankenstein monster that is a little to wimpy for my taste. Will Kemp is good as Velkan the werewolf brother of Anna Valerious.Elena Anaya, Silvia Colloca and Josie Maran are the very sexy (and whinny) brides of Dracula. The ending was not as good as it could have been and was a bit too soapy for my taste. The bottom line. If you like your monster movies, special effects movies, action/adventure movies and very sexy and attractive women, you will love this movie. Be prepared for a fun and visual treat. If you do not like monster movies, special effects movies, and action/adventure movies and would rather see a movie like The Breakfast Club. You will probably will not like this movie.If you were thinking of seeing the picture, go for it. Do not let the pious professional artsy fartsy film critics dissuade you. It is not their kind of movie anyway.",Van Helsing

Here you've got the Frankenstein monster, Dracula, and Mr. Hyde teaming up in a story that makes no sense at all. You wonder what this actually is all about. If you want to see a good horror spoof go way back to Roman Polansky's _The Fearless Vampire Killers_ - now taking the enormous production value that went into this movie it is really a shame how little comes back to the audience.

She's a terrific actress, and I really like her.I loved the special effects and the costumes, but the plot line was very convenient, and there just didn't seem to be much there. My daughter hated the movie. Hated it. I'd still like to own the DVD though, but will probably wait until it's in Hollywood Video's Previously Viewed pile. I'm sure the cast, once they saw the completed film, as it was released, probably felt the same about it. Which is too bad. Seems like someone had a great idea, but maybe all the good parts were left on the cutting room's floor.Seem's like it was made for the much younger audience -- 10-12 yr olds, not an adult audience.

One is that the makers have a love for the genre, obvious with the old school tributes, and two was to make an entertaining action movie. Which i would say that they succeeded in doing so, i enjoyed the fact that there was a lot of action, too many times people ruin the pace of movies by trying to balance out the action with love stories or some other garbage. Certain movies are not meant to be that way, and this is one of them, that is why i hate when people gauge it against other movies that are made with different intentions. And i am also a big Dracula fan and i realize that they fudged the Van Helsing legacy, but you couldn't have this movie with Anthony Hopkins running around fighting all of these creatures, even though he did an amazing job in bram stokers Dracula as the real VH, but this is a different movie, with a different story, and a very different purpose.....overall i enjoyed this film for what it was worth and i will be purchasing it when it comes out on Oct. 19",Van Helsing

684,alexgoldfinch,A lot of money and a big hat,1,24 November 2004,"This is simply the worst film I have ever seen. It is mind-rotting muck of the highest category, and is written and directed by a man who should at all costs be prevented from churning out any more of this dumb garbage (see also THE MUMMY, and that other polyp on the backside of film-making: THE MUMMY RETURNS).Hugh Jackman is a fine actor and given the right script and character he can be extremely watchable, ditto Kate Beckinsale, but both are wasted here, being given cruelly awful dialogue, and characters with all the depth and interest of an episode of SCOOBY DOO. Speaking of which I've read lots of reviews on-line by enthusiastic(presumably) 13 year olds who say how great the CGI effects in this film are. Cobblers. It just looks like a lot of money has been spent on creating a lot of very cartoon-like images designed to give the viewer sensory overload and prevent him/her from actually THINKING. Naturally this has much in common with video arcade games, and so those with a mental age of 12 or below are more likely to be impressed.The biggest offence that this film caused me is the fact that writer/director Stephen Sommers claimed to have been ""inspired"" by the classic Universal horror movies of the 1930's and '40's. Aaaaarrrghhh! This film has NOTHING but the names of the characters in common with masterpieces like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, WEREWOLF OF London etc. These films had atmosphere, great performances, characterization, a sense for romanticism and for the eeriness of the supernatural...all qualities that this excrescence of a film cries out to be blessed with. VAN HELSING has errr...a lot of money thrown at it and Hugh Jackman in a big hat.I cannot tell you how much I hated the performances - the guy who played Dracula was about as effective a replacement for Bela Lugosi as a pencil would have been. But worse...so much worse was the bloke who played the comic sidekick monk. His barely-disguised irritating Australasian accent didn't help matters, but he just came across as an unfunny moron one just ached to see impaled on one of those silly crossbow bolts that Jackman was firing hither and yon. What did they teach him at drama school?My abiding memory of watching this putrid rubbish,(and indeed the only happy one of the entire film-going experience)was the roar of laughter in the cinema when Kate Beckinsale's ludicrously accented gypsy got killed and Van Helsing in werewolf form let out an absurd howl of grief. It reminded me of Oscar Wilde's comment on the death of Little Nell in THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP - to paraphrase: it is impossible not to be overcome with mirth.Terrible, just terrible.",Van Helsing

686,chrisr_70,Awful,1,22 October 2005,"This was so bad, I had to walk out on this film 15 minutes into it. Absolutely appalling. I loved the old 1930's/40's horror flicks but this is just not them. If you watched Van Helsing and The Mummy back to back you'll see how unsuccessful Van Helsing was at re-capturing that familiar sense of engagement we had with the old classics. For those people saying ""Oh, it's just a bit of fun, camp fun"", I do not think that was Sommers intention and if it was fair play to him. But I will argue that those classics were not just 'camp', they were a lot more textful than that. They had weird, eccentric characters in them but the films were crafted to have your sub-consciousness take the story seriously, that's what made them great. You know what to expect from them, watching them is the closet feeling to that one you get when you sit round a camp fire out in the dark with friends and freak each other out with little spooky tales. Van Helsing fails at this. I am a fan of CGI, but only if it looks real. The CGI in this made me cringe, its part of the reason I walked out the cinema. CGI can look incredibly good, or it can look incredibly bad in movies. You look at the CGI in Van Helsing and cannot help but be disengaged with the film and think, that's not a vampire, its a silly looking computer animation. And there was lots of it too, even in just 15 minutes. This wasn't fun, it was poor. Whenever puppets, costumes or make-up was used in the old horror films, obviously it looks silly but it can be real enough to accept it as being real, for the sake of enjoying the film. As much as I tried, this did not and would happen in Van Helsing with the CGI monsters. I find with most CGI characters in films they just don't have the correct body movement physics or facial expressions to justify themselves as believable characters, its a very serious issue that is overlooked. For me, the CGI in Lord of the Rings was superb, I didn't feel myself being disgusted with it such as in Van Helsing or in the Starwars prequels. Please, save your money and do not buy or rent Van Helsing its just a poor movie which fails as a tribute to the old classics.",Van Helsing

If I can save one person from renting or buying this film for his or her collection then I've done a very good thing. Let me begin by saying that I admire Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale as actors, so the problem is really not them in this movie, but rather how the movie is presented. First of all, I have a problem with the hero's name. I was certain that Dracula's nemesis was named Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, however in this movie version, his name is Gabriel. Secondly, Gabriel proceeds to use what appears to be modern day gadgets that one would find in the arsenal of Buffy Summers, if one were to look. If the setting of this story is supposedly sometime in the 19th Century, then why does ""Gabriel"" have these modern day ""Bat-toys?"" Thirdly, the script, what is up with all of those silly one-liners? And again, the characters are speaking in the modern vernacular, and not the eloquent, dignified speech of a 19th Century European settlement. These glaring discrepancies are what ruined this film for me. The silly one-liner jokes, modern day speech, and Bruce Wayne/Buffy Summer Vampire fighting gadgets cheapened the entire enterprise for me, and as a result, the film lacked authenticity.

Is a pity that ILM animators didn't do a better job. I would like to know in which parts is Weta involved.The story sometimes packs too many ideas at the same time as to try to get the viewer confused or lost.

A definite regret for her in hindsight.No character development, no story, poor CGI, horrible screenplay and absolutely no feelings for Van Helsing himself or his Crusade.  Some background on Helsing and why he became so bent on wiping out Monsters other than a ""life-debt"" he owed to the Church would have been nice.I wanted him and his ANNOYING sidekick - Carl (played by David Wenham) to randomly take one of Helsing's bow-gun spears to the head very early on! With the 100's flying around as Helsing - being the ultimate Assassin he is - somehow avoids to hit his targets in what seems like a bad space chase with ""lasers"" gone awry!  I guess the Church is not good at creating weapons or Warriors!The movie ends as hopelessly as it started - with a bond so strongly cultivated throughout the movie with Monster Frankenstein - Van Helsing and cohorts show their love for BIG FRANK by placing him on a raft - 3 logs wide - and sending him out into the watery Abyss.

You'll have to see it yourself to know what i mean. But it also sets the tone for an action film that rarely lets up. In a good way that is. Hugh Jackman might have a Harrison Ford-like future if he wants. Imagine a good looking guy, who can handle the big budget action films, but with more depth of character than Ford has ever brought.(Possible Spoiler)This Van Helsing, not to be confused with the better known Abraham, is a 007 for the late 19th century. Fighting larger than life villains (Mr. Hyde, The Wolfman, etc.) under the auspices of an organization (the Catholic Church) protecting the world from disaster. Only now he must fight his deadliest enemy, Dracula and his minions.Despite the length (over 2hrs 15min), the pace rarely falters to blandness. Credit this to director Stephen Sommers. Seems more confident in his creative choices then in The Mummy (the less said about the sequel, the better). Granted, Kate Beckinsale did nothing in this film that Rachel Weisz couldn't do as well, so maybe a little money could have been saved. And like The Mummy, Sommers needs a comic sidekick. In this case, David Wenham as the cowardly friar making weapons like Q to help out Van Helsing. Wenham and Jackman's interplay goes well, as they rise above their dialogue. No such luck between Jackman and Beckinsale.But this isn't an actor's or a writer's piece; this is an ILM piece, and boy do they come through. The effects are a standout, with the best computer-generated morphing/transformation sequences i've seen in quite a while. Thumbs up for the sound effects and editing crews as well.

The dialogue was so bad that at certain points it was too cheesy to sit through. There was little to no logical connection between the characters. The brides of Dracula were so under developed that it would have been more effective to not have them speak. The claim was that this movie would be like Indiana Jones, but the only similarity was the hat Jackman wore. Beckinsale relied way to much on her looks and didn't bother to bring any real acting to the movie, which is a shame because I enjoyed her in Underworld.

The best part was the Wolfman's transfiguration although it was hard to see details. Plot and drama were weak and only a couple of real frights in the whole movie. Performances were ho hum although Samuel West was effective as the Baron but he is quickly dispatched. I longed for some suspense but it never happened. I recommend the originals on DVD now and also Hammer's updates with their beautiful cinematography and charismatic stars.

But the Americans have the bad habit to destroy the entire film with the too sentimental ends of their films! Why do they do that? It is too slushy and that irritates. The role of Dracula is a bit miscast. He does not play it very mysterious and he does not look dangerous in all scenes. Kate Beckinsale plays very good as well.

Although, the accents given were nothing to be proud of. It seemed that they worked hard on many of the costumes. But it seems, also, that they went much too overboard on some of them, or hadn't thought of them enough. Some things that happened, or were said, seemed to be completely irrelevant with everything else, such as Kate Beckinsale's, or Anna's, weird obsession with the sea. Which was, by the way, completely and utterly RANDOM...I think.

That is, unless you just want to sit back, switch off artistic judgement, suspend all belief, and just enjoy the show for what it is: a cheesy action flick with a few novel ideas.  See it with friends; laugh at how stupid it is; laugh at the cartoon laws of physics; laugh too at the witty one-liners, occasional comic timing, and joke references to other stories.It's a shame that with better script-writing and direction, this could have been an excellent film.

At what it's trying to do, it largely succeeds; with good action scenes, likeable main characters, tons of classic film references, and a Dracula who is basically an over-the-top version of Bela Lugosi (though played with enough charisma to make it work).What it does not try to do is be a remake of any of these classic horrors, or to be anything other than an action movie. Therefore, to use these more serious titles as a yardstick for this film is absurd.The two biggest flaws are the CGI, which does look fake in places, and the acting, which includes some wooden moments from Jackman as well as a lot of overacting from everyone else. That being said, the over-the-top nature of the story helps stop these elements from feeling out of place.In my opinion, it's a film which has held up well, and which makes for a good watch around Halloween. Especially if you've already had your fill of slasher movies and are now in the mood for something light-hearted.",Van Helsing
700,Vibix,Why's everyone taking it so seriously?,10,8 May 2004,"Sure it's camp and over the top, but it's all in good fun. Like, it's not a true story, and there's been a million and one variations on all these stories, so what's the big deal with adding a few little bits? Sommer's hasn't done a bad job combining them together. I'm Hugh-centric and a big vampire fan so I enjoyed it. There were enough twists in the plot to keep me going and a little surprised here and there. The humour's okay too. The David Wenham character is funny. The original Frankenstein's  monster had a compassionate nature and was intelligent; he just didn't get what he wanted, so in the book he killed folk- his creator had a choice in that, whereas here he is a pawn and aware that he doesn't have to be a bad guy.People watch worse television everyday and don't complain about it. Leave your disbelieving brain at the door and enjoy the ride...And, uh, don't take it so seriously!!",Van Helsing
701,IsisSaralonde,Van Helsing: Fun to watch with friends! Purists: run for the hills!,9,3 June 2007,"First of all, I'd like to say that I do understand the people who really hate this movie. It's got A LOT of CGI in it and almost more action... and that makes it a great movie for some and trash for others. I myself have now seen it about 7 times, including a time with audio commentary and I just can't get enough of it.**The following might contain spoilers**So, the story is a little cliché. A man goes to some country to vanquish a great evil, while that great evil plans to take over the world. But this cliché formula can make a great movie when used in the right way. Sommers and his cast and crew managed to do so. The movie is beautiful, great special effects, wonderful locations and a funny and well-chosen cast. The jokes are good, the accents even better (accept for Kate's, she overacts in my opinion) and Richard Roxburgh is a marvelous Dracula.Let's take a look at the cast. First there is our monster hunter and all-round evil vanquisher Hugh Jackman. Too bad he left out his Aussie accent. He is a rather boastful hero, but the only steady thing in this story. You know his goal and he seems to know too, so just go for it!Then up pops David Wenham, with a real funny walk and talk. His hair's funny too and those ears... Poor Daisy... He's still great, despite his strange behavior. I think he should also join the Australian baseball team because he throws almost everything.They needed a bad-ass girl, so Underworld's leading lady Kate Beckinsale came over... No offense, I just don't like Kate Bacchanal...Who I did like is Richard Roxburgh. Richard does great, had a really cool accent and even seemed to BE Dracula! His international brides Elena, Silvia and Josie rock and look wonderful accompanying their dark master.Whatever anyone says, Shuler Hensley played an unforgettable Frankenstein's monster and Will Kemp is adorable as Velkan.Good cast, no wait, GREAT cast. Anyone who dislikes this movie should see the bloopers, the interviews and making offs. You really start to adore the actors and maybe, with a little good will, you could even start to like the movie too.I recommend this movie to any person who's open-minded enough to not flip out because there aren't any lengthy conversations and no deep character studies. It's also good to have a strong stomach. More importantly, this movie is best when watched with friends, because making fun of David Wenham's wrong ears and Dracula's pop star-like ponytail is a lovely thing to do on your average Friday night. There's only one thing that bothers me and that is the way the Wolf man looks. The ears aren't what they should be...One last thing: Do watch the movie with Richard Roxburh, Shuler Hensley and Will Kemp commenting on it. They have juicy stories about some scenes...",Van Helsing
702,tiefling23,Kate Beckinsale in a corset....,2,7 May 2004,"...yum. Unfortunately, I've just enumerated all the reasons for seeing this movie.I went into this movie hoping to see a decent action/horror flick, light on plot, and was surprised to find that the movie didn't live up to even those meager expectations. Van Helsing never seems to be in mortal danger at any point in the movie, which left me with a ""Who cares?"" attitude throughout. The arch-villain, Dracula, is something of a wimp, who spends most of his time letting his wives do his dirty-work while he sits around various castles and walks on the ceiling.Besides seeing the breathtaking Kate Beckinsale in a swashbuckling outfit, the only other bright spot to the film was the performance of David Wenham as Friar Carl. Wenham shows his acting abilities as he goes from the proud but troubled Faramir in Lord of the Rings to the stooped, studious, witty and faithful sidekick in Van Helsing.If you want an action/horror flick, in which you can drool over Kate Beckinsale, go see Underworld. If you want a loud action movie with gadgets, gizmos, supernatural powers, and great special effects, go watch or re-watch the X-Men movies. But if you want a ludicrous movie where you find yourself bored silly, laughing at the script, plot, and fight scenes, and checking your watch while you wonder how you could have been so stupid to have wasted $8, then catch Van Helsing in theaters today!",Van Helsing
703,When_Mantises_Attack,A tragic slaughter of an idea with immense potential,1,5 September 2007,"This had the potential to be one of the best monster movies ever made. With the superlative Hugh Jackman on board as well as Kate Beckinsale - specifically and brilliantly proved in this genré in the vastly superior Underworld movies - matched to a good idea, a sound plot, and a healthy budget, Van Helsing should have been a shoe-in for the #1 slot for the best horror/action/adventure flick of our time. In particular, the creature designs were nothing short of spectacular. Van Helsing's werewolf is hands-down bar-none the best I have ever seen in a motion picture of any vintage or budget. The transformations, the vampiric and other monsters, and the motions thereof were also absolutely top-notch and were paired with smart cinematography to create an astounding visual treat.Sadly, all of this was sent spiraling into the ground courtesy of the most atrocious dialog I can ever recall seeing on the big screen. It's an odd feeling covering one's eyes, shaking one's head and blushing with embarrassment over a movie that you had absolutely nothing to do with creating ... perhaps it was because a group of friends was there with me at my enthusiastic urging. How awful it is has to be heard to be believed, as I lack the poetic talent to describe it adequately. Add to this two-dimensional characters, very weak character development, and inability of those characters to connect with the audience, and what we are left with is a total failure of writing.This movie proves that the script is key to a movie's performance. Even world-beating actors/actresses and world-beating special effects fall face-flat in the dirt when matched with weak characters and a script that sounded like it was written by a melodramatic tweeny-bopper girl just beginning her run of puberty.As an especially avid werewolf fan, I am angry to this day that the best werewolf ever to grace the silver screen was wasted in what was perhaps the most mortifying letdown in the genré's history. As much as I champion the Underworld series, I'll be the first to admit that the Lycan design for those movies (barring William at least), while not horrible, did fall somewhat short of expectations. However, good cinematography, excellent use of lighting, and above all else, STRONG CHARACTERS AND SOLID DIALOG more than compensate for this. Had Underworld had Van Helsing's werewolves ... wow ...So in conclusion, to all fans of this genré who have not yet seen this movie, two suggestions: One, either avoid this movie entirely, or Two, if you must watch it, do yourself a favor and hit 'Mute' immediately after hitting 'Play.'",Van Helsing
704,Kaurilainen,One of the worst movies ever.,1,7 May 2004,"This was absolutely below anything I can remember. Idea was great and it had huge possibilities, but yet, somehow director/writer managed totally mess this up. He didn't get anything out of the actors. I'm bound to think that Hugh Jackman really can't do any other role than Wolverines due to this movie, Kate Beckinsale didn't do any better than Hugh.Films editors most likely aren't doing the job they should be doing. Cuts were strange and abrupt. Dialog was awful and abrupt. Draculas actor? He should be doing something else than acting, or if he would act he would belong to role of doctor Gangreen in some Killer Tomatoes movie series.Only thing good in this movie when i saw it was my friends whom i was there with. And for the price of ticket we should've headed for a pint instead.(And I thought Operation Mars and Battlefield Earth sucked were the absolute bottom, I stand corrected.)",Van Helsing
705,Joe96366,What happened?,1,8 May 2004,"Some had a cool idea for a movie, but definitely pitched it to the wrong people. Oh wait, the guy that had the idea for the movie wrote the script. Which leads me to one conclusion: Sommers should have stopped writing movies after The Mummy Returns, at the latest. This movie had so much potential, but was wasted on terrible scripting, and way too much CGI. And not even good CGI. They should have just done the whole thing in CGI, a la Final Fantasy (even though I didn't much care for that movie, either). The only humor came from seeing David Wenham go from Faramir to a dorky, horny... friar? I forget what he was, even though he made the same joke about it twice. The second time was the funnier. The love interested between Jackman and Beckinsale was sophmoric at best. All in all, I thought it was lame. But hey, I work in a theater, and some kid saw it three times in a row, so to each his own, as they say.",Van Helsing
706,Jackpalance,"Thanks Again, Hollywood!",1,10 May 2004,"Kicking off the summer movie season with a bang, Van Helsing is a wonderful reminder to why one should just go in to cinematic hibernation from May until September.

I was wrong though, but I wouldn't ask the filmmakers to classify this movie.  It's obvious that they didn't know what the movie was either, because at some points it's camp, trying-to-be-camp, kitschy monster movie, serious romantic drama and a few others.  It gets very annoying.And the only character I found to be likable, was Carl (David Wenham). He's the typical sidekick character whose job is to help the hero.

710,carl_ian_andrews,Cheese Fest from Nam,1,19 May 2004,"I cannot understand why a movie production would put money in behind such a terrible storyline and terrible idea. I have seen films that pay homage to the great monsters of our time but this just rips that to pieces. Bram Stoker honestly will be rising to kill Steven Sommers in a fit to some how right the wrong that was this movie. I am sick to death of films being made purely to make money. This was in noway a good film. It was not slick, no sophistication that usually accompanies vampire movies. I could not take Dracula seriously, there was a comic relief monk. I strongly recommend avoiding this movie for the purposes of trying to put stop to Hollywood cheese. The ending was pitiful with Jackman looking into the clouds seeing Beckinsale's character uniting with her family, is this type of cheese really necessary, brutality is what was needed especially when dealing with the vampire of all vampires Dracula. Sommers has destroyed the story in every sense. There really is only one thing i can say had any substance in this movie and that was the special effects and they should not have been wasted on a film such as this. I seriously hope that the monster movies as a genre have not disappeared. I would love to see a more serious approach being taken towards them, maybe this is the movie that could change things, if movie directors are as disgusted with this as I am maybe it is possible, I'm looking for a solid monster movie from maybe someone like Peter Jackson to restore the genre to its former glory.",Van Helsing
711,aazell1-853-695525,Appallingly Awful!!!,1,24 September 2010,"Let's face it... here on IMDb people only enter reviews for films they truly love or truly hate. I can't see many people logging in to write a review of a film they found mildly entertaining. Well there may be some but they probably should get out a bit more.In the case of Van Helsing I think I can honestly say that it's the film I love to hate. I feel it's so bad that it belongs up there with Batman & Robin as a possible contender for the worst film of all time.Where to begin....Almost the entire failure of this mess can be attributed to Stephen Sommer the director. When he directed the Mummy he was relatively unknown so the studio kept him on a tight leash and as a result we got a well balanced kind of Indianna Jones film with horror homages. It worked well and I thought it lots of fun.Then I saw what Stephen was capable of when you take the leash off in The Mummy Returns. Dear god what a mess. Plot goes out the window, tonnes of cheap, lazy and pointless CGI comes in and characterisation is completely ignored. Sommer had become the king of CGI for the sake of it...The film begins in black and white as an obvious homage to the classic horror films of Dracula and Frankenstein but it quickly becomes apparent that the huge CGI budget won't be used to any decent effect when you realise that the only alteration to the actual picture is that the colour has been removed. No CGI is used to give the black and white section a grainy or authentic look. You could get the same effect just turning down the colour on your TV.Then we meet Dracula. He's awful. A caricature of the classic horror villain rather than an actual depiction. There's no threat to him, at all. He looks like he's just turned up at your parents Halloween party in a slightly expensive outfit.Van Helsing himself is just Hugh Jackman playing Hugh Jackman in a Van Helsing costume.David Whenham's sidekick is rather embarrassing to watch as the Aussie actor does his best to take on a comic English accent and has a go at slapstick (which he fails at miserably by the way).Kate Beckensale is always easy on the eyes but aside from being a woman with a need for vengeance there's very little for her to do.After a slightly odd battle between our hero's and a bunch of flying chicks in the local village things descend into the incomprehensible.The story jerks along between one CGI set piece and the next and takes so many ridiculous turns that you give up trying to follow it after a while. Instead you sit back and let the CGI awfulness wash over you until you decide to turn it off.The problem is that because no time is spent on any of the characters or the story, you just don't give a toss about what's happening on screen no matter how mind-boggling a stunt the CGI is trying its best to suggest.Bottom line this film should have been a wonderful homage to the age of the classic horror movie. Each character, good and bad, should have been lovingly represented with the care and attention they deserved.Instead each character is shoehorned in as an excuse to show more badly rendered CGI.There's no love here, at all. It's just vacuous action with no point to it other than to make you say ""wow look at all that CGI"".If you're the sort of person who complains about a film because there's too much talking in it then this may be for you.The rest of us need to be aware that drivel like this actually exists and needs to be avoided at all costs.",Van Helsing

A waste of characters, each known separately and having good stories behind them, however all of them got twisted to the point of making the spectator feel that the screenwriter is just manipulating everything behind the name of all of them. Adding insult to injury the dialogs are ridiculous, and the story even worse, I felt like watching the League of extraordinary gentlemen all over again. Also the actors in the movie were drastically wasted behind a mist of CGI and a lot of scenery. It got to the point where it seemed like a badly knit bunch of scenes where Van Helsing was tried to be made into a sort of 007 from the past even recreating the laboratory where all his gadgets are made and just took Q for a ride including him in the mission. It seemed like a bad stew of stories from past authors with a new and bad twist mixed with CGI. Just plain bad.

714,wahe,Stop Sommers Before He Kills Again!,1,10 September 2004,"As a fan of 1) good horror films, 2) Bram Stoker's novel, 3) Murnau, Browning, and Terence Fisher's 'Dracula' takes, 4) Peter Cushing; and having detested Stephen Sommers' 'Mummy' films, and having read all the reviews, I was not exactly in a great hurry to see this film. But I was willing put my purist's taste in the closet, along with my critical faculties, all my higher brain functions in fact, and just take this as zippy moving wallpaper, and finally renting it on the cheap on DVD, I found that even my spectacularly low expectations were not only stooped to but surpassed by this woefully empty exercise in CGI doodling off. The 3-page script I would reckon to have been packed together by a bunch of excitable pre-teens riffing on their favorite Horror and Adventure flicks, but I suspect such kids would have provided more solid characterization and plotting than this thing provides. Firstly Mr Sommers et al toss out everything that was interesting and meaningful about the Van Helsing character and the Dracula legend and fill in the gaps with a lot of agony aunt superhero stuff and a few good ideas (the secret Vatican anti-monster force, the warrior Gypsy clan) that are of no interest whatsoever to them, as they are only interested in layering on effects and stunts, the cumulative effect of which is incredibly boring. Making the heroes nearly as indestructible as the villains - as in the bit where Kate Beckinsale falls about four stories down through a tree's branches and lands with nary a scratch - really helps to make you care and believe in them. As with many modern movies, it is magnificently shot and dazzlingly designed, but provides no sensual pleasure whatsoever in its technical wizardry. Hugh Jackman does the intense superhero bit surprisingly well and all he requires is a script with lines of dialogue that make sense. Richard Roxburgh I wish would stop playing villains, for here as in 'Moulin Rouge' he goes right off the deep end with a stupidly campy performance. Beckinsale lacks steel, humor, and anything resembling sex appeal; I've followed her career since 'Cold Comfort Farm' and she gets duller by the passing year. David Wenham, the most talented of the three Aussies wasting themselves here, manages to make a couple of lines work with a good comic act. Compare this film to the genius of Tim Burton's 'Sleepy Hollow' (from which it steals a steroid-pumped version of the coach chase) which combined old and modern movie tropes so cleverly. At the point when I checked how much of it I had sat through - 81 minutes - and realized it still had something like 40-50 minutes to go, it was high time for the eject button.

717,piemanmoo,Such an awesome movie (may contain spoilers),10,22 May 2004,"First, let me just say that this was an INCREDIBLE movie. I think it's right up there with the X-men's. Hugh Jackman really sold this one. It exceeded all my expectations, and left me wanting more and more. I heard a lot of bad reviews from my friends before I saw this, and let me point out that they are no longer my friends. Nobody has any right to think this movie is less than perfect.The story was so incredible! The way they worked in Frankenstein and the Wolfman was beyond sweetness. Each forming their own intricate part of the fabric of the movie. The plot was so full of suspense that I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. Oh, and I can't even begin to describe how amazing the special effects were. They were probably the best I've ever seen.And lets not forget the characters. They were probably the best part of the whole thing. Here are just a few aspects of how cool they were:Van Helsing: From the previews he looked like one of those Spiderman ""Oh, my life's work is also my curse, it's so hard, boo hoo hoo..."" but this guy wasn't all crybaby about it. He took pride in nuking the hell out of all evil. I know what you're thinking, how all vampire hunters are automatically cool, but no other ones can even touch him. He doesn't just run around with a stake in his hands like these other idiots do. No, he gets a kick-ass auto-crossbow and blasts the crap out of them. Screw garlic necklaces and all that other pansy garbage. This is, like, the new age of vampire hunting.The Friar:Now this dude was my hero. He's like some quiet monk guy who's helping Van Helsing with all this high-tech equipment, but he still finds time to do the no-no cha-cha with a random chick. Plus, he was always there when somebody needed his helpDracula:No more of these boring old geezer vampires who look like they'll have a heart attack any second. If you cross him the wrong way, say good-bye to your soul. He'll be like talking to you one second, and then all of a sudden *chomp* you're dead. Before you know it he's picking pieces of your neck out of his teeth.Anna:Cool. Frankenstein monster:You except him to be some mindless monster going ""ugg....uuugggg..."" all the time and just being a huge inconvenience to everyone else. But once again a character's not what you expect. He looked so ugly, yet he was so peaceful and friendly. He was willing to sacrifice his own life for others. Now that's a stud right there.Torches, flying, darkness, crossbows, bombs, gravestones, ooze, secret passageways, huge jumps, pitchforks, insane laughter, racing coaches, revenge, thunderstorms, and more. WHAT ISN'T THERE TO LIKE????If you thought this movie was bad in any way, shape, or form, please kindly tattoo the word ""worthless"" on your forehead and bury your face in the sand.

Put it this way it is a far superior film than the League of Gentlemen which is in the same genre, Coltrane's Mr Hyde is excellent compared to LoG! Jackman & Beckinsale are fine in this but don't expect any oscar nominations for either. The support Friar chap is funny, and helps tone down Van Helsings macho bravado.All in all its not going to move arthouse film lovers in the same way that it will move popcorn movie fans.

725,elanor_magda_bonney,"Wolverine, the Vampire Slayer",3,24 May 2004,"Well, it was yet another Sunday afternoon and I had just watched the Breakfast Club, so I was in the mood for the movies and some good acting. Thus I decided to try out the new Hugh Jackman-movie, Van Helsing. Good. I hadn't much expectation anyway, believing that it would be yet another nicely done action film similar to the Mummy. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. I don't know when it hit me (probably when the heroine in the high heels opened her mouth to speak in that weird, completely unnecessary accent), but suddenly I knew that this would be a film focusing on the impact of the special effects rather than the plot outline. I wasn't exactly expecting Shakespeare, anyway, but there were some things that made an ""old"" movie buff like me cringe: -There were hints at some deeper involvement between Dracula and Van Helsing, as well as his role in the ancient history of Transylvania , but somehow, all was badly explained. -There is no way one can understand why Van Helsing was, like, 400 years old, being human. He was human, wasn't he? -If the people in Transylvania were speaking their own language, why did they bother putting on that preposterous accent anyway?-Why didn't Van Helsing have that accent(from what I know, he was German anyway), if he lived there 400 years ago? What did he do in the meantime? How did Anna know about him? Was she speaking English? -Did anyone else notice how often the heroine was hurled against rocks, spun around, beaten up and God knows what else without breaking so much as a fingernail? And in the end, Van Helsing throws her on the couch and she just dies out of no apparent reason. It struck me funny and I wonder who thought of that lame ending for her after she'd proved to be unbreakable.Last but not least, the main character curiously reminded me of X-Men's Wolverine: his charming, innate grumpiness, his quest for recovering his memories, yadda-yadda-yadda. I can't imagine I was the only one who noticed that. All in all, Van Helsing is a movie packed (over packed) with action, wonderful special effects (which are becoming tiresome, to say the least), a hilarious, sneering villain and a great sidekick... but absolutely no story. It is cliché after cliché and appallingly shallow. Nice for a Sunday afternoon, but I wouldn't watch it again... ever.",Van Helsing
726,peterm76,No stretch but a lot of fun.,8,6 May 2004,"If you loved the Mummy and the Indiana Jones flicks then you will enjoy Van Helsing. Hugh Jackman and Kate Bekinsale turn in credible performances and the special effects are second to none (the horse and carriage scenes are fantastic). My one concern is the opening sequence. Filmed in black and white it comes across as a bad parody, I wasn't sure wether to laugh or not. Happily the film picks up as soon as the opening sequence is finished.On the whole I really enjoyed this film. It looks amazing and the action is plentiful. This film is FUN!! I hope there is a sequel but only as long as there is no annoying child actor as in the sequel to the Mummy.",Van Helsing
727,nostgard,"Great monster movie throwback, fun movie on its own.",8,10 May 2004,"I keep seeing bad reviews for this movie, and I can't help but wonder why. I came into the movie expecting the worse. I've been disappointed by movies often lately, and the trailer for this one had all the symptoms. I wasn't even comforted by the fact that it was directed by Stephen Sommers, whose Mummy movies I really liked.However, I can safely say that I left the movie completely satisfied and my faith in Stephen Sommers as a great ""adventure"" movie directory has been solidified.Maybe people are looking to get too much out of this movie - I don't know. I never expected it to be an award winning movie. I just went into it to have fun. I'm a big fan of old monster movies, and this movie has numerous throwbacks to the old movies... I started laughing out loud at a lot of the camera work because it felt so much like a classic monster movie. They did an excellent job at paying tribute to a lot of the classic moments from these movies without obviously straying from the story.The story was decent to good. There were a lot of elements I liked, but there wasn't a HUGE amount of depth to it (not necessarily a problem, in my eyes). My only real problems with the story were some rather large jumps they did from one scene to another without explaining the events in between very well.The action was very well done, as was the accompanying computer graphics that made a lot of the scenes possible. The special effects weren't always on par with other recent movies, such as LGX, but they were definitely believable for the most part.My vote for this movie was 8/10. I think it did what it set out to do - make a movie that paid a tribute to the monster movies of old, while giving audiences a fun filled two hour ride through a large cast of characters. The movie was just the right length, and besides some plot holes and CG problems, I was a happy movie-goer at the end of the experience. If you liked the Mummy, I can definitely recommend this movie.",Van Helsing
728,ramona106,THE WORST MOVIE OF THIS YEAR,1,11 May 2004,"Gabriel Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is a man-on-a-mission, determined to rid the world of its most evil, nightmarish creatures. Working through a clandestine Catholic connection, he's off to slay Count Dracula (Richard Roxburgh), along with Dracula's jealous, bloodthirsty brides. But in Transylvania, he's not the only vampire hunter. There's intrepid, corset-clad Anna Valerious (sexy Kate Beckinsale), plus Frankenstein's Monster, the Wolf Man, even Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde.The movie is a one big disappointment. Wooden acting, VERY BAD VISUALS EFFECTS and boring like hell.Oh, did I mention this.Kate Beckinsale is the worst actress ever.The movie plays like one long preview for a video game.  The film's CGI sets are as handsome as you'd find produced by the finest game machines.Many, many times dialogue is idiotic: It has about as much life as a drained corpse. ""You can't kill me,"" Dracula actually says. ""I'm already dead!"" You're telling me.
I went into Van Helsing expecting a cheesy B-movie.  Unfortunately, what I got was a very bad cheesy B-movie.  I give it a Z.",Van Helsing

I really have no idea why so many people gave it bad reviews. I noticed nothing that was bad about it. I've noticed that a lot of reviews say that there was no plot to it. What the heck are they talking about!?!?! I followed the movie quite easily. And the special effects just blew me away!!! The transformations of The Wolfman and Dracula were spectacular! I've really never seen any better!Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were in my mind Oscar worthy and if no one else agrees well the heck with you!!! Because I really don't care what other people say about this movie except for me! if you're wondering why I""m putting just this on, I'm doing it so that I may have some peace of mind knowing that I put my opinion out there and don't care what you say about it. That's right I'm doing this for me!!! I don't know why I waited this long to say this! I saw this movie the day after it came out.Oh yeah and to all you people who think Stephen Sommers has never directed a good movie, you should really think about watching The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, and Deep Rising some of the best movies I've ever seen!!!",Van Helsing
730,acedvampirehunter,Glorious!,8,10 June 2004,"It was glorious, it had all the elements it needed to be perfect! It had action, adventure, mystery, horror and the locations chosen for the filming were excellent. I've got a friend who has seen tens of films with me at the movies and always managed to have nerves of steel but when the first vampire spawn sprang out he jumped off his seat! He felt really ashamed because I keep refreshing his memory on the incident. He is my horror meter and he went off the top so Van Helsing certainly had it's great horror moments. It is much better than films like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer as thrillers are concerned which give you that one second fright which passes after you munch a bit of popcorn because you feel the atmosphere changing slowly when a scare is coming up (lowering background music and sounds, heavy breathing by a character(s),etc...) and the audience thinks ""Oh no, I forgot to empty my bladder before the film!"". I am a huge vampire-hunting fan and I was really satisfied on the explanations given about vampire slaying (although I have to check the Dracula vs Werewolf legend out). Go see it. It was great fun and I hope that this genre will be revived after many years of abandonment.",Van Helsing

I saw it's also a new movie or an anime and there's a tv series too, so those will go on my watchlist (where it will probably stay for a long while 😂😂).",Van Helsing

The Effects were great and I especially loved the werewolf, best one that I've seen in years.Exactly what I always have imagined one would look like.Steven Sommers is an excellent director and I have loved all of his movies, he does monsters excellently and realistically, and keeps the fun in the movies.

The special effects are very good, great computer effects. The story is entertaining, taking an old venue and mixing it with a new twist. I never heard of this writer, director, producer before, though I am a bit naive in that way, but it was a top notch production to me! I recommend that you Watch it on a large widescreen TV for a real treat! You will not be disappointed at how interesting the movie will keep you as it is action packed and always moving from scene to scene. One of the things I did love about this movie was its pace and the characters are wonderful too. Two thumbs up for me!",Van Helsing
734,ienge,The ruining of a could be great story,1,16 December 2004,"This movie has all except a good story. All fans of Dracula knows the magic of van Helsing. In Coppola's movie he is there when Dracula resents God, and becomes an undead. The doctor pursues Dracula for the 400 years until he has the final encounter in London when the count goes there looking for his life's,and death's, love. Taken from this scenario van Helsing could have been a very good movie about the hunt for the master vampire during those 400 years. But obviously they have saved the money from the story writing and chosen to go with special effects and half naked beautiful women. Mixing to much of modern action and modern weapons, looking rusty old fashioned,in to a medieval scene is in my opinion not helping this movie. Also it must be said that after Oldman as charismatic dangerous Dracula(In Coppola's movie) it just will not do with a plain nice looking ""James Bond"" type for a Dracula no matter how long his hair and bad his words. At best Dracula should be Oldman, but at least they should use an actor with a ""sting"" to do the role.",Van Helsing
735,empress-5,One of the worst movies ever made,1,21 December 2004,"This campy spoof of monster movies, James Bond movies and adventure films is probably destined to be a cult classic, it's so awful. By turns hilarious and excruciating, one watches in disbelief that the writer of some of the very best adventure movies of the modern age could have been involved in this mess. I'm not sure that the scenes that left me almost literally rolling on the floor in tears of hysterical laughter were actually meant to be funny at all. There are some familiar names involved in the supporting cast, who were all brilliant in other movies but fall far short in this one, and the cgi work is erratic at best. In fact, I can't imagine how a post-Gollum movie could turn out something as lousy as the disgustingly amateurish Mr.Hyde. The plot is ridiculous, the supposedly clever comments and catchphrase-wannabes are lame beyond description. There's nothing to recommend this to anyone, unless you like being tortured by a really bad movie. Avoid this one like you would a huge flock of winged demons! Actually, if I had a choice between being attacked by demons or watching this again, I'd take my chances with the demons.",Van Helsing
736,beerandscratchings,Watch Dead and loving it instead,1,17 July 2005,"First a confession. I gave up watching this travesty after the first hour. As a human rather than an immortal vampire, I decided that I could not waste any more of my limited lifespan on this appalling film.I watched the monochrome opening under the belief that this was a spoof shown before the main feature.As it featured Dracula and Frankenstein I expected Abbott and Costello to appear in the manner of the recent deadstar-studded Virgin train commercial. Richard Roxborough's, camp as a field of tents, performance then lead me to believe that it was going to be a re-imagining of Carry on Screaming.As for supporting performances, special mention must be made of Alun Armstrong's accent - scary although it has to be said that it was not as unconvincing as the CGI effects during the aerial attack by the brides of Dracula.If you want to see Kate Beckinsale in a vampire flick watch Underworld. If you want to see a better vampire film watch ""Dead and Loving It"", If you want a reinterpretation of the Van Helsing character, may I suggest Von Goosewing in ""Duckula""",Van Helsing
737,supersapienjw,Epitome of cliché (plot points but not spoilers inside),3,13 March 2005,"I would have loved giving this a 1, but that wouldn't be appropriate unless every facet of this film was horrible.There are a few saving graces. Namely, the fairly good CG work and obvious high production value. But the plot is atrocious! It steals exact, specific lines from other movies, it steals entire scenes from other movies, and I'm not sure, but it looks like whatever else was original was already present in an earlier Japanese animation series called Helsing, and was probably stolen from that as well.There were a few moments that were so stupid that they were funny. About ten minutes in, Van Helsing is fighting Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, tosses him out of a window, and the monster turns back to a human on the way down to his demise, letting loose a hilarious, ""huh?"" before he smacks pavement. Later, in the middle of a calm conversation between Helsing and Dracula, Helsing whips out a cross and shoves it in Dracula's face. Dracula proceeds to grab it, catch it on fire, and scream at the top of his lungs for an extended amount of time. Helsing (I believe) drops the cross. Dracula continues talking as if nothing happened, the previous ridiculous grimace faded from his face.The only thing that made this watchable was Kate Beckinsale, she was beautiful in this role.",Van Helsing
738,val-120,Utterly Painful,3,6 February 2006,"This movie has nothing to recommend itself. There is no plot, no character development, and no re substance. Everyone involved should sue the director of this travesty for career endangerment. It seems like the director tried to create too many various sub-plots and lost all of them about half-way through. The Frankenstein's Monster B-Story gets lost amongst the Werewolves, Dracula Babies, and Fallen Angels. The latter being introduced far too late in the story to be anything, but a total distraction. To be honest, I gave up half-way through it and only finished the movie because my friend had the car keys. Needless to say, that friend does not get to pick the movie any more.

I started dreaming about genuine B movies, which have been whipped away by computer generated effects. I suddenly woke up because of my neighbours' complaints - (yes, I snore loudly). I blamed myself for every penny I spent for renting this movie. Then I realised that somebody else paid for the rental and I felt a little better. And I felt much, much better because I didn't go to a cinema to see this boring potpourri. Definitely to be avoided.",Van Helsing

Kate Beckinsile was beautiful. The scenery such as the ballroom were fabulous. The best scene was the very first, ballroom scene, and all of Dracula's castle, and don't forget the chase scene with the Wolfman. I recommend it. Frankenstein's Monster though I must say was the most spectacular. This movie should please everyone because it has so many elements combined so wonderfully along with great music surprises, and more. Please watch this movie everyone. It is a triumph of cinema.",Van Helsing
741,somedumbnoob,Surprisingly good,7,18 July 2005,"Van Helsing is basically the story of a monster hunter who lives in the world of Gothic 19th century creatures. The movie is not so much horror but steam-punk science fiction. He works for a worldwide peacekeeping service that employs anyone from Islamic to Buddhist and is surprisingly enough based in the Vatican. Van Helsing looks an awful lot like the WWE wrestler the Undertaker.Van Helsing is called to Transylvania to kill Dracula. Even though its cold, dark, and a few people every month die as sacrifices to the vampires there are still quite a few people living there. And even though the town is in Europe people still use feet and inches. There he finds Anna who looks like a 16th century pirate in fancy clothes while everyone else wears rags. Anna's family has basically fought against Dracula for centuries and no one can kill him, now she is the only one left and Van Helsing has to save her.The computer graphics and special effects are very good and the story is decent. All the monsters are nicely animated except for Frankenstein's creature who looks very fake in the costume. The movie looks very corny from the beginning with items like automatic crossbows and self spinning throwing stars. Its basically batman set 100 years before and with a lady buccaneer. While not nearly a classic, Van Helsing makes up for a well entertained 2 hours.",Van Helsing
742,wishful_goddess,"Very, very bad.",3,16 May 2009,"Let me say that I am a huge fan of Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale and David Wenham, and I don't really have a bias against popcorn flicks or mainly action and CGI-based movies. I enjoyed The Mummy series, and I expected Van Helsing to be somewhere along the same lines: good actors, action adventure, a few snappy funny lines and a very basic but suspenseful storyline.It is not.It is very, very bad.The film has a very flimsy storyline, gaping plot holes, and terrible dialogue. The CGI is very poorly done and is glaringly obvious, to the point where you are unwilling to forgive it. At first, I was very happy to suspend disbelief and continue along as the plot took me. And then, very early on in the film, the plot totally vanished, and I was left saying, ""What the hell is going on?"" Count Dracula requires the machine invented by Dr. Frankenstein (along with his monster) to bring to life his offspring who, because he and his brides are undead, are naturally, born dead. This makes no sense, but you can kind of accept it and that's not a problem. Dracula has lost Frankenstein's monster, however, and has been trying to make the machine work with Werewolves. It fails. At the same time, he's trying to kill off the Valerious family, the last remaining survivor being Kate Beckinsale's character, Anna.Anna is by far one of the absolute worst heroines I have ever seen in a film. She is completely useless! Nothing she EVER does in the ENTIRE film is AT ALL HELPFUL. She prevents Van Helsing from killing the werewolf that her brother has turned into, she is a major disruptive factor in his killing the vampires, and is constantly offering nothing but incredibly annoying and petulant dialogue. ""I don't need any help"" (directly before displaying how totally awful she is at defending herself against vampires, and directly after completely botching an attempt to kill a werewolf), ""We've been trying to find Dracula for 400 years, I doubt you can do it in 2 hours"" (moments before Van Helsing and Carl discover the door to his lair which was so glaringly obvious it's impossible to miss it), ""You fool! Nobody knows how to kill Dracula!"" (after Van Helsing's failed attempt to kill Dracula, after she has refused to disclose any information whatsoever that would be helpful).Van Helsing is no better, really, but would have been much more interesting if his storyline was actually, I don't know, EXPLORED instead of just HINTED AT CONSTANTLY? At the beginning, we are told that he has no memory of his past, and grabs at the chance to go to Transylvania for the opportunity to learn more, but right at the point that Dracula is attempting to TELL US, he says, ""Some things are better left forgotten"" and then kills him. Thanks, that's great, but what about the audience?! Maybe we want to know? Dracula himself is a complete failure at being scary, and is a complete failure at being camp. The characterisation is just bad.And the gaping plot holes? The parts of the movie that just don't make sense? There are SO MANY. Like, they leave Transylvania at a full moon, and then, by the time they hit Budapest, it's already 2 days until the next full moon? It took them A MONTH to get there? Okay, I accept that, but explain to me how it took them only a few hours to GET BACK to find Dracula's lair? How about how at the end, Dracula is apparently missing a finger, but he hasn't been missing a finger for the rest of the entire movie, and even after that moment of revelation, he miraculously has the finger again? And how does a man who is undead and can heal continuously, even not have a finger to begin with? The ending is sappy and unbelievably stupid. Oh, there's CGI Anna, up in the clouds with her family, near the sea (a throwaway line of dialogue earlier that made no sense, and was apparently put in just to enhance the ""emotion"" of her funeral) which is glittering beneath a sunset. And then, as Van Helsing and Carl leave, back for Rome, they walk out, towards land, towards...oh, the sunset again. It wasn't cheesy enough with just ONE sunset, I guess.AVOID THIS MOVIE. IT IS BAD. FOR REAL.",Van Helsing
743,cosapphire,I loved it but if it isn't the kind of film you usually enjoy- don't go there!,9,30 January 2006,"Van Helsing, a film I went to see purely because it was raining outside. And I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. The basic genre is action/adventure/horror; that pretty much sums the film up. The plot isn't up to much and it looks as though it was just a big get together of all of Universal's favourite monsters. But sit back and enjoy the action and the film is pretty good, the effects work and the music is fitting. Yes, the acting isn't going to win any Oscars and KAte Beckinsale does what she seems to do best- kick butt in a tight costume (Underworld + its sequel). If you look at Stephen Sommers' other films 'The Mummy' and 'The Mummy Returns' it becomes evident that fun, sometimes silly and generally poorly plotted action adventures are what he likes to do. Again, films like this won't appeal to everyone and won't win any awards but don't we go to the cinema to relax and enjoy the film and Van Helsing fits the bill (though be careful not to spill your popcorn- there are a few bits to give you a fright). I have seen Hugh Jackman do much better and for people who have only seen him in this film I say that he is really a very talented actor. The actors are mostly well cast and there is plenty for the boys (Beckinsale) and the girls (Jackman) to enjoy. Don't watch the film if you want to see something sophisticated and well-scripted with stellar performances and superb dialogue, please steer clear. However, for a night in, this movie is great- especially for the younger generation who will probably be able to look over the mistakes and plot to the action sequences and CGI. All in all this is an easy going low-budget flick which you will either love or hate, decide for yourself. Some of you may enjoy the comedic references and one-liners and others will think they are silly and out of place but I liked the overall effect of the film and think that too many critics took it too seriously and therefore the film was underrated.

Were it not for some lighter moments with the female vampires and a re-imagined Frankenstein monster, I would consider this the most pointless movie of 2004. Some reviewers have noted that Van Helsing borrowed elements from a number of other recent movies. I agree. In that vein, this movie is its own Frankenstein monster.

The film was 2.5 hours of a lot of comic book style action, which was great to watch.  The only character which had the most development was Frankenstein's monster.  He actually had dialogue.

After 20 minutes, I began to think that the box office should issue cyanide capsules along with your ticket to this show. It's not much of a horror show, but it is a nightmare ordeal to experience.There isn't much of a story or character development. There's barely an effort to create any sense of time and place. The dialogue and action is laughably insipid. There is never any sense of peril or suspense, because almost everything is obviously pasted together on a Mac. (NOTE TO DIRECTORS: If I can see that the hero is fighting a CGI monster on top of a CGI Notre Dame, rather than a monster with some physical presence on a set that resembles a real cathedral, what's so thrilling about that? Where is the sense of real danger? If I see a runaway stagecoach driving down a CGI path heading for a CGI canyon, what's supposed to make me care?) Even the costumes are out of place: Jackman is dressed like the mysterious, brooding hero of a postmodern Western, and Beckinsale in her bodice and lycra pants appears to have been pulled from a Meat Loaf video.All that's here is Wolverine from the X-Men fighting some CGI versions of famous monsters, presented with a relentless assault of loud noise (in Surround Sound!), going through the paces of various ridiculous and implausible scenarios. I had to sit through it until the end because I was with a group, but I actually slipped out for 5 minutes in the middle just so I could get a break. Towards the end, I started to feel like I wanted to cry. Seriously. Like another reviewer said, I felt like Alex in A Clockwork Orange being forced to watch such horrible images until I broke. As I walked out after the show, I wanted to ask the concessions people if they could sell me back the last two hours of my life.It was one of the worst movie-going experiences of my entire life.

750,girlyskin,Big and dumb- and I loved it.,8,12 May 2004,"I'd read quite a few reviews on different sites where people were complaining about the lack of substance and how the movie didn't take itself seriously and so on and so on. And, well. I really don't know what in the world those people were expecting from a movie with vampires, werewolves, *and* Frankenstein's monster directed by the guy who made The Mummy. Van Helsing was everything I expected it to be: big stupid monster fun. For crying out loud, it had villagers with pitchforks and torches in the beginning! How can anyone expect a film that starts off that way to be high art?Speaking of the beginning, I was absolutely delighted with it. Some people might call it a rip-off but I thought it was a brilliant homage to Frankenstein (it's been a while since I've seen it, but I'm pretty sure up until Dracula pops up, it was shot-for-shot the same).Also, Dracula! Quite a few people have expressed the opinion that Richard Roxburgh wasn't portraying him seriously enough, but, again, why would he? As soon as he began to speak, I was all, 'ha!  Bela Lugosi!' and, oh, I loved the way he camped the entire thing up. Along the same lines, I also loved his brides. The scene of them all overemoting and wailing after the vamplings all exploded? So cheesy! It was fantastic.Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale were okay, although I spent most of the movie wondering when Kate was going to say, 'Ve must get moose and squirrel!'The best part of the movie, though, and the main reason I wanted to see it, was David Wenham. Absolutely darling and funny! And it was kind of weird because I've only ever seen him as Faramir, aka The Saddest Man in All of Gondor, but I loved it. Maybe I'm just easily amused, but I had a giggle-fit almost every time he appeared on-screen.  I don't understand why Carl had to be so short, though. Well, okay, maybe I do a little, to make Van Helsing all the more larger-than-life and all that crap, but, still. My back hurt watching him slump around. awww, poor Daisy.I do have to agree with everyone who said the CGI sucked. The brides weren't too bad but, god. Jekyll? bleh. Didn't like that at all. And the werewolves all looked...well. Fake. Come on, folks. If you're going to CG, at least make an effort.So, yeah. overall, I loved it. I went in expecting non-stop action and lots of pretty, and that's pretty much what I got, plus some laughs (some maybe unintentional, like 'The roof, the roof, the roof is on fi-yah').And I am all about a sequel. More Daisy! YAY!!!",Van Helsing

You can't expect too much from this genre but it has a good mix of action, horror, romance and even a bit of comedy (There are some great 'tongue-in-cheek' comments) It also looks good; the sets are lavish and some scenes have a glorious over-the-top 'Hammer House of Horror atmosphere about them.

754,gement,Straight through ridiculous into sublime (VERY mild spoilers).,8,30 May 2004,"I apologize to all of you who didn't get the joke. Particularly to those of you who were sitting near me in the theater while I was cackling maniacally.Even the people who liked this movie don't seem to have been mentioning what I considered its biggest feature: it's a massive parody. Apparently they overdid it so far that most of the audience couldn't see it.Imagine, if you will, the scriptwriter. He's been given the right to put in *anything* from Universal history that he wants. So he makes a movie about Dracula AND Frankenstein AND the Wolf-man. Then, to make sure people will get the joke, he puts in baby pods like Alien and lights them up like the Matrix. Then, to make *really* sure people will get the joke, he makes the lead Wolverine with Batman's toys, and gives everyone multiple opportunities to swing from ropes of exactly the right length at exactly the right time.We go to the movies to see things that can't happen, but we'd like it if they could. Fantasy movies often stumble when they try to do one of the Great Plots, but they're ashamed to go all the way because it ""won't be realistic."" Come on. It's Dracula. None of this is realistic. Revel in the cheesiest plot of all time! I'll be in the fifth row. Come cackle with me.",Van Helsing
755,herrtitenfisch02,One of the best comedies made this decade! (Everybody rope swings!),1,12 August 2006,"What a hilarious movie! This version of Dracula was the most foppish, nonthreatening fancy boy ever to be on screen. Don't make him mad or he'll sneer and make a snide comment. Or worse yet, he'll get one of his undead midget zombies to... uh, I don't know, uppercut your knee cap and bite your ankle? Frankenstein's monster was not only loaded with hackneyed dialog but was a great addition to the absurdity. And his retarded gait is one of the funniest ways of walking since David Cross's impersonation of a strut in ""Pootie Tang."" Not to mention the funniest scene in the whole movie where we get to see Frankenstein's monster swing from a wire three times in a row in what looks like the same scene looped over and over and over. It made beer shoot out of my nose I was laughing so hard.The Wolfman was simply ridiculous. Werewolves are big, sure but when are they supposed to be twenty feet tall? Bigger than Frankenstein's monster? And am I supposed to believe this Saturday morning cartoon quality computer generated thing is actually interacting with the characters on screen? Please tell me this was supposed to be funny.The sexy heroin was also a laugh riot. The thought that anyone could fight anything supernatural or not while wearing a corset with stiletto boots is worth a few chuckles. Sexy? Sure, but so impractical. It's like fighting off zombie Nazis with Bettie Page and Dita von Teese or ghost hunting with the Playboy bunnies.And Van Helsing? Apparently the creators of this movie never bothered to read ""Dracula"" or even see all the ""Dracula"" movies. This is a cookie cut facsimile of exactly what American cinema does to characters from classic literature: Take a good character and make him a macho cowboy. This version of Van Helsing doesn't even know what a freakin' vampire is.And he works for the Vatican which apparently manufactures spy gear for supernatural slaying like the Q- branch in James Bond films. (Obviously, the director like James Bond movies so much he copied the Q- gadget scene with little to no scruples. Is the Pope M, then?)About the special CGI effects? The computer animation from ""The New Adventures of Johnny Quest"" was not only more convincing than ""Van Helsing's"" but was also a more noble effort. The battle between werewolf Helsing and Bat- form Dracula looks like two guys playing ""Soul Caliber"" except the graphics in the movie aren't as good as an Xbox or Playstation 2. As a horror/ action movie: this simply sucks. Oh, my god, I can't convey in words how much this sucks. Watching someone else play ""Castlevania"" is tenfold better than suffering through this tripe.But as a comedy? Absolutely hilarious. Grab some beers and some friends and get ready to let the absurdity and hackneyed Hollywood crap that is ""Van Helsing"" rip your sides open.",Van Helsing

Fortunately, you can't screw up established properties to the point of no return, but they give it a good try. I saw many people get up and leave for pee breaks even though exciting scenes were happening. I need to see it again, without the running commentary from the guy behind, who thought he was doing MST (without the jokes). It is watchable, trashy but watchable with some very good performances. However instead of them taking time and developing characters for a franchise run, they just squeeze in everything they can and it doesn't work.

But I don't agree at all; it's not literary depth, but it isn't the typical linear plot either. This movie is 2 and 1/4 hours long, but the pacing stays fast throughout. The visual effects are really great, and they blend in well. And the story ... well, it's not quite linear, but has appealing twists and turns.In summary, this movie is better than many others. It is a genre movie, so if You do not like fantastic vampire stories and are totally and exclusively into Rosamunde Pilcher or Pedro Almodovar, better do not watch it; for the others - 7/10.",Van Helsing

Not so much.  Nothing much between the characters that would make you think they had a thought for each other.  When Van Helsing transforms into a werewolf and attacks Princess Anna, shouldn't she have looked a little more.....well, ATTACKED?   The best part of the CG glut was the wives of Dracula transformations.  That I enjoyed. But basically it was a loud, violent, mishmash of monsters.  No,  I pass on this one.",Van Helsing

Hugh Jackman was miscast, and Kate Beckinsale looked great but her accent was horrible. Richard Roxburgh (as Count Dracula) was actually pretty good. He was the only one who really looked like he was having fun as he chewed the scenery. Unfortunately, he was the only one who took this route for his performance. The comedy was stale, the action was cookie-cutter, and the plot was uninteresting. I felt like this movie didn't know what it wanted to be. I think it could have been a pretty decent, campy, fun film, but instead, it just takes itself way too seriously and ends up scoring extremely high on the unintentional comedy scale as a result.",Van Helsing

Hugh Jackman gave an admiral and strong performance as did Richard Roxburgh.  There were just some terribly annoying things to watch throughout:  (1) Kate Beckinsdale's perfect make-up, especially eyeliner, (2) her ridiculous clothing (3) the horrendous make-up job on Igor.I viewed it as the first movie of the summer and gave it leeway as such. I thought Hellboy was a much better movie (considering what is in theaters now). I expect spectacle for summer.  This had the spectacle effects.

I'm a big fan of monster movies, especially when they include vampires or werewolves. Van Helsing has both, AND Frankensteins monster, so I have been eagerly awaiting this title. And last night was the world premiere, with Galla, monster outfits, push-up Vampirella outfits and so forth, what a JOY!!*****Minor Spoilers below*********** Unfortunately the movie is very disappointing. The storyline has so many holes, it must have been bitten by a rabid vampire. The plot is pretty standard, with no surprises at all, leaving your guesses from the start of the movie, confirmed at the end.Right from the beginning, you are told that the main character is several hundred years old, which makes him some kind of immortal. Hence, you never get to feel that he is in any kind of danger. You know what kills vampires, you know what kills werewolves, you don't know if there is anything that can kill Van Helsing. This is probably the biggest problem of the movie. IT NEVER GETS EXCITING OR THRILLING!! Add to that, Van Helsing is the James Bond of forgotten days, armed with an arsenal of ""futuristic"" weapons and devices which are always there to save the day.Acting is good. Casting is decent.The graphics are pretty OK.The backgrounds are great, leaving you submerged into a dark and creepy world. Most of the effects are decent, with a few glitches, and some poorly created CGI effects here and there.The soundtrack is unobtrusive, creating a good atmosphere. Sound effects are for the most part decent, but not good enough to bring on extra ambiance.I'll not recommend this movie to anyone. You might enjoy it on a lazy Sunday evening,  but do not expect anything exciting to happen.Best Regards Robert ToftePS.: While I do not dislike that Van Helsing has been turned from an elderly wise and knowledgeable man, into an younger and more action oriented hero. I DO dislike that they can't pronounce his name correct. The ""V"" in Van Helsing is pronounced as the German ""V""(Fau), hence the name is pronounced Fan Helsing, but in the movie, everyone pronounces it as if it was an American name.",Van Helsing

It is one of the most poorly written scripts I think I have ever seen.  Nothing was developed well, be it the characters or the plot.  I wanted to leave after the first 30 minutes, but figured that it would get better.  Boy was I wrong.I can't say much about the actor's performances, because they were given so little to work with.

The continuity was lacking in a number of scenes, which is critically important because of the constant jumping from human to animated action. The soundtrack was actually the best part of this movie. Acting was terrible. I kept being reminded of other movies' characteristics: aspects of James Bond and Alice in Wonderland; Wild, Wild West (failed attempts at interesting 19th-century technology) and Jumanji (CGA was outdated); Indiana Jones (anachronistic wisecracks), Frankenstein, and Young Frankenstein (an erudite monster).

I cant really blame the actors too much here you can tell its what they had to work with, but the whole movie takes itself too seriously for what would be, sans the budget, a B movie. These guys should have taken a cue from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, another compilation of characters, that movie has a strong comic relief type character to balance all the unbelievable action, there was no relief here. Also it was hard not to make fun of the way too depressing Frankenstein. All and all this movie could have been done much better, but any time you have a writer, writing and directing, you are gonna lose perspective.I gave it a 2.

And of course, shots of Kate Beckinsale's brilliantly formed ass in tights close up.However, the story does tend to bore after a while and you may find yourself fast forwarding to the fight scenes. And a lot of whining from Van Helsing's side kick who couldn't do a simple thing without first having a fit of fear before leaving it right to the last moment to do something.All in all, this was a good film but it could've been made a bit better in my opinion",Van Helsing
770,yakkamut,A little bit too corny for my liking,6,8 May 2004,"***Warning--some spoilers...sort of***The movie ticket should have come with a complimentary glass of wine, with all the cheese we had to take with it.  Some scenes were more improbable than the Canucks chances of ever winning a Stanley Cup.  This movie seemed to have left over bits of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Hugh Jackman's role seemed almost exactly like his role of wolverine in X-men, complete with the nightmares about his hidden past and oh, the fact that he becomes a wolf too.  Is this a coincidence that this movie was filmed around the same time as X-2?  Maybe the scripts were accidentally mixed up while filming.
On the good side of the movie, the action in it was definitely entertaining, and I thought that the CGI was very impressive.  If you are just looking for a movie that's entertaining, has good action scenes, some pretty girls (like Josie Maran), and will give you a couple laughs, than see this movie.  If you want to see how a real vampire movie is made, go see Blade.

771,venvariants,A Real Treat - pay no attention to naysayers..!!,10,25 May 2004,"Van Helsing is a wonderful popcorn movie, and you're bound to enjoy it if you're not going in looking to rip it to pieces. Like the previous Mummy movies, the plot is treacle...but with every corner there's a fantastic action sequence that goes on forever. The main thing with Van Helsing is that it makes no quips about what it is...and then the movie delivers in spades. A lot of spades. Saying that there is a tremendous action sequence every five minutes or so is not exaggerating..! There are plenty - plenty - of cool, elaborate battles, very well executed and shot beautifully. The film itself is absolutely gorgeous to look at - the scenery playing probably the most important role in the film. If you like Gothic, fog-enshrouded landscapes along the lines of Hammer films - then you're in for a treat. Van Helsing is set not only amongst a beautiful, beautiful backdrop of foggy landscapes...but also has a very nice nod to the old B&W Universal sets as well. The cinematography and scenery are worth the price of admission alone - for those with a classic eye. If you're trained in your classic horror films and literature, you're bound to appreciate the effort put into this piece a great deal more than someone who, say, was raised on Terminator and NFL. The negative word of mouth I've been hearing seems to be coming mainly from cultureless lunk-heads who haven't researched anything before 1977. Do not pay attention to them - Van Helsing is a real crowd pleaser, and an awful lot of work on every level went into this film. There's not only beautiful scenery and sets - the monsters are really gorgeous. The brides of Dracula are really something - and the battles with them are fantastic. The actors are all gorgeous, as well - but the director has a good eye for character...none of these people are good looking in your typical, bland, storefront means. They're lovely in the sense that they're people that you would genuinely be attracted and endeared to...rather than a flavorless sculpted Barbie or Ken. The writing allows for just a minimum of character development...but, honestly - it's just popcorn...and if you're looking for more than a great looking, high-flying action movie - then you're in the wrong seats. But - if you know what you're getting yourself into, and want to have an absolutely wild ride..! Van Helsing is a wonderful summer action movie...and good word should be spread about this baby, so we can at least get another one..! And by the way...the lusty soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is the very best movie music out there right now..! No kidding - the music is delectable. Most everything in Van Helsing works - just don't go in being a knob...or you're not gonna get it at all. It's a blast!",Van Helsing
772,sparklingdiamonds,The Aussies were the best bit,8,7 May 2004,"Going into this movie, i was extremely excited at the fact there were 3 fantastic and very talented australian actors in it. Being Australian myself i felt a sense of pride to see the movie due to an Australian having top billing in a hollywood blockbuster. And i must say if it wasn't for them i would not have made the effort. i saw the movie last night and was extremely disappointed with what i saw, visually it was a stunning movie, the cgi they used looked very good, but that all fell down at the fact that there was no story! if there was, i'm still trying to find it.The movie had a lot of monsters and characters with out really introducing them properly, and the audience was left wondering why they were in fact there. im still not sure what kate was doing there! i really didn't think that she fit in with the rest of the cast, also was she meant to have some sort of ""super power"" as she is the very slim figure of a women who gets the absolute s*** kicked out of her in some scenes and then she would jump up and run off with hardly a scratch???The three aussie boys, Hugh, David and Richard did very well and brought to life their characters even though they were written so badly. David as Carl was great, although if the character had of been written better there could have  been endless possibilities with what he could have done with it. For me Hugh Jackman was a stand out, this man is charming, he can act plus he can sing and dance like peter allen, all in all he is perfect! and the scene where he rips is shirt off, is a must see for any female!so overall i think this movie will go well in australia due to the casting, but i know that i would not have gone to see it if they weren't in it. 8/10 because of hugh, david and richard but take them out and it is about 5/10!",Van Helsing
773,capn_cobra,Meant to be a campy monster flick - and delivers!,8,7 January 2009,"Van Helsing was never meant to be a world-shattering, ground-breaking feast of cinematic platinum by any stretch of the imagination. What it stood for was pure fun. Unfortunately, in this 'enlightened' day and age, a lot of people do seem to consider this idea somehow inferior and primitive.""Fun?? Forsooth! Movies aren't supposed to be fun! What do you think this is, the entertainment industry?""This isn't one of the best movies ever made, nor is it among my all-time favourites. But I can watch it any time and still be entirely pleased by the time the amazingly spiffy credits roll around. You don't go to see a movie like this with the same standards in mind as going to see 'The Shawshank Redemption' or 'The Godfather', and nor should you judge and review it as such. I went into theatre with a taste for popcorn, iced tea, and campy thrills and got everything I wanted.One thing that got my attention was that it's clearly designed to be a throwback to the equally campy old B-horror movies of the 30s-50s, a genre I love. This is best showcased in the black and white prologue. And let's face it, those films aren't revered for their realism. The action was unlikely, to say the least, and to say the most, awesome! The dialogue was cheesy, but funny and enjoyable, and occasionally quite witty. The plot was suitably far- fetched. Overall the effects were breathtaking - seems to me that if someone hates a film they will automatically trash on the effects regardless of their quality. And the casting, regardless of what you thought of the performances, was next to perfect.So, if you want to see something that's going to make you think, ponder the human condition, take a reflective walk round the block, this film isn't for you. But if you want to curl up on the couch with your girlfriend and just watch a fun movie together, I'd wholeheartedly recommend Van Helsing!My humble opinion is yours for the taking.",Van Helsing

If it's action, dramatic accords with a driving rhythm try to accelerate your heartbeat, if it is a love scene... (insert violins here...) and so on.Since this is a movie, that never really lets go of the action, the music seldom takes down a step from the dramatic rhythmic accords, but even when the scene suggests a breather... an example.The heroes ride across the country (insert sweeping helicopter shots like LOTR 1 - Fellowship here), lots of action (insert sarcasm here...), driving score... the heroes enter the Transylvanian village (""DOOM! DOOM!..."" ""DOOM! DOOM!..."" ""DOOM! DOOM!..."") and get off their horses. (one more doom doom and I would have left the movie... in hindsight sitting through it was a mistake).I am normally a sucker for soundtracks and I own many of them, even though the movie itself is so-so (""Crimson Tide"", ""Waterworld"" as examples for great scores accompanying mediocre flicks), but this score only detracts from the experience.",Van Helsing

So many annoying points to mention, that it would be no fun to think about them again. To me it seemed to be a children's film. And it certainly would be one, if there weren't so many brutal scenes at all. The director mixed-up information about all kinds of creatures: vampires, werewolfs, frankenstein's monster, Dracula, jekyll & hyde  in the end, vampires are even killed by silver pegs, which are originally invented to kill werewolfs. Everytime monster-killer Val Helsing starts off to fulfil his orders, a whizz-kid provides him with the latest stuff to properly kill any evil creatures (like the supplier in James Bond films before every big task). This time Van Helsing leaves to get rid off the big boss' Dracula. Young amazon-lady Anna living in Transilvania carries out her duty to help him. There are a few problems like the people in town who were accomplished to being surrounded by vampires and not willing to support chaos, Frankenstein's monster being the target of Dracula due to the formula of endless life and Anna's brother mutating to a werewolf. But whatever may come into the way of Van Helsing seems to be no real problem, he simply rips it off. I rated it 3/10, because of the great surroundings and atmosphere in the film. This is really something mentionable: the special effects are quite good (but not well integrated into the film at all, unlike in the film Alien e.g.), the places and localities are somewhat interesting.

I find it quite funny actually (the situation with Hyde/Jekyll is hilarious).I think most people thought it was going to be an adventure story, and that happens quite often. When you think a movie has a precise genre (adventure) and it turns out being more funny, you're disappointed. I had that with From Dusk Till Down, at first I thought it was going to be a kill, kill, kill movie and when those vampires arrived I just couldn't watch it anymore ! But after a year I ""tried"" to watch it again, knowing it had some fantastic spirit in it, and I really liked it.

That may sound bad, but can be a good thing if you are into cartoony specialFX-ladden, none-to-serious action movies like Batman, LXG, The Mummy Returns or even the James Bond Franchise. Don't see this film for the plot, which is mediocre at best, just enough to carry the arrangement of specialFX. See it as a fun cartoon, only done with real-life actors instead (at least some, as at least 50% of the cast actually are CGI). One serious warning though: The film tries very hard to be cool, but often overdoes its own themes. Some scenes are just pure ridiculous and seem to be straight out of a spoof like Scary Movie, but generally the film is as much fun as a themepark ride capitalising on proven, non to surprising but well done shock and awe FX (I especially think that the Werewolfs were done very well, far better than in the horrendeous ""Underworld"").

My questions is how can somebody, who is educated, experienced in directing and writing, given a great cast and crew, completely destroy great fictional characters and absoulutly fail to tell a story.The only saving graces of the film (if it can be so called) it the great talent that the cast had to shove into thier roles.  And while I admit, the scenery looks good, the story will have you shaking your head.  The CGI was over the top (MORE HUGE JAW EFFECTS), the plot was empty, the twists were pointless and the changes to the ""Dogma"" of the Monster Characters irritating.Only Stephen Sommers could create this garbage.  I beg and plead anybody with the power, PLEASE MAKE HIM STOP!!!",Van Helsing
779,jt_gonavy,"Disappointing, but visually pleasing.",4,21 August 2004,"I was disappointed. The plot tried to incorporate too much, and wound up failing in all respects. They go out of there way to incorporate most monster mythologies, but they are skewed, and don't really fit together well. Much of the plot, and character motivations don't make sense. Kate Beckinsdale's accent is mildly ridiculous, and I don't think she really pulls it off believably. Hugh Jackman, as always, is a pleasure, both in performance and and as scenery! There are a few humorous moments, but they often seem forced. And the female vampires are so over the top, and to take away from the movie. There were points that I couldn't wait for the scene to be over, and the stupidity to end. In all, the effects, costumes, and scenes look fantastic, but it is not enough to compensate for a bad plot and an uninspired script.",Van Helsing
780,Riddler_J,Van Smellsing,3,14 October 2004,"Well what can I say without feeling that I'm using too many words on a film that doesn't even deserve a mention? Any film that requires Hollywood actors to do Eastern European/Russian accents is bound to fail because, let's face it - nobody can pull off a convincing performance.The score is horrible, the characters are the kind you wish just want to die and the effects beg the question - if you can't get into a film because there is far too much noticeable CG, then why don't they make the whole thing CG?Of course, the hopes for this to succeed were non-existent ever since Stephen Sommers (Mummy, Mummy Returns, Mummy zzzzz) got his grubby little hands on the project. His direction sucks, his writing sucks - and he's done little more than wreck three decent actors, one decent actress and the entire monster list for Universal.The only purpose for recommending this film to you, would be to realize how hype can make a film seem promising. Take my advice, make a switch to Asian cinema and Anime. They can manage an original story, because this one sucks well before the Vampires show up.",Van Helsing

Van Helsing was the most boring movie I have ever had to sit through.  The acting was horrible, even by Hugh Jackman.  My Grandma could've done a better job acting as one of Count Dracula's wives.Within the first half-hour, one of my friends was asleep. I ended up falling asleep for like 10 minutes, then waking up and falling back asleep.  All together I probably missed about a half-hour of the movie. I have never, ever, fallen asleep in a movie theater before...thats how boring this movie is!Van Helsing was horrible as a movie, but great as a nap-time! I give Van Helsing a 1/10.",Van Helsing

What a waste! Hugh Jackman should be a huge star by now considering how he was plucked from near obscurity to be in the ""X-Men"" films, especially as he went on to steal them from under the noses of far more experienced actors. And when I think about the fact that Stephen Sommers career started out so wonderfully with the near genius film ""Deep Rising"" (""What are you looking at?"") and has gone downhill so much I almost cry. I have to say, if it wasn't for the fact that I'm in love with Kate Beckinsale I would've walked out of this film... and I've never walked out of a film in my life. And I go to the cinema about 60 times a year; so there! Just to rant a bit more: I bet this film gets better reviews and better receipts than last year's ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" even though it borrows heavily from it and has half the wit of that film. OK, rant over. I'm just a bit drunk but really more than a bit disappointed. Kate Beckinsale is fantastic though isn't she..?",Van Helsing
783,shaoc,No good...,3,6 May 2004,"I went to this film expecting some really cool and atmospheric vampire slaying action; though I did expect not a masterpiece at all, I was badly disappointed.Actually, I'm not quite sure if this movie is meant to make fun of itself or not, for there are many scenes with obvious jokes (which are basicly very flat) but as the scene continues I often believed it to be meant serious, but this was the actual fun part, because all scenes are so overloaded with computer generated effects, bad acting, flat jokes, ""fortuities"", prejudices and sterotypes (mixed all fantasy myth stereotypes in a very postmodern way (e.g. Dracula, Werewolves, Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein)) that it caused almost a physical pain in me by merely watching those scenes.During the whole movie there was no suspense created at all, the happy end was foreseeable all the time. Especially the last scene was badly overdone and tawdry.This is not the kind of vampire movie I like (and I do like vampire movies). If you have a certain pretence to a movie, don't pay for seeing this one. If you are drunk and want to have some fun, it'd probably be ok. I really kind of despise this film.",Van Helsing

785,shawnrhod,By far - Not the Movie to 'Kickoff the Summer',3,18 May 2004,"Well, this happens to me only once in awhile. I decide to see a 'Blockbuster' movie on opening day. Problem is that I don't have a chance to assess creditable reviews on media blitzed Hollywood movies, which exaggerates false promise and almost always disappointswith few exceptions (i.e. Spiderman 1, Gladiator).Van Helsing was no-exception. This was out write terrible. I guess this could have been my fault. I new the direction the movie was headed. A Stephen Sommers (The Mummy) directed, PG 13 rated, summer blockbuster that needs to cover its cost by grabbing the widest possible audience. Lets make a vampire movie for the family, so to speak. OK, with that said, I will expect a fast action, corny (yet sometimes funny) dialog, computer animated joy ride. If this is your cup-of-tea, then the 'formula was there.' However, the movie lacked all the major support elements. The story was muddy and boring. What was Dracula's end result? Gremlin babies to fly around and do what, torment the world. This was never really clarified for me. Besides why in the world would Dracula want to create little gremlin vampires when he has an endless count of full grown, equally as menacing vampires chilling at his masquerade. If death by a certain creature were the only way to destroy Dracula, then why wouldn't he eliminate or keep the threat as far away as possible??? There are many questions like these you'll be asking yourself during and after the movie. Like, what happened to the original ware wolf, and did they literally bite that idea from Blade 2 (you'll understand when you see the movie).Maybe the Friar Carl played by David Wenham (Lord of the Rings), would have been a nice comic relief but the exhausting vibe of the rest of the movie absorbed any liking one could have for the witty Friar. In fact, all characters were boring; I don't care how good they looked. Kate's character had fluctuations in her accent. Hugh's character has flat. Dracula had a clip in his hair, and the women vampire's were sexy, but unnecessarily screamed and wined. I could care less what happened to the characters in the end. It turned out to be comical and I just wanted the movie to conclude.Kate and Hugh are terrific actors; they are both attractive and have immense screen presence. Putting Kate (the Vampire movie lover) aside, I'm extremely disappointed in Hugh. I don't expect him to pick up the slack for a horrific screenplay, but I do expect him to make better decisions in the future. I have no problem if Hugh is chasing money and popularity, but at least set a standard for movie selections. This is your first big mistake 'Hollywood Hugh,' please don't make another, at least not anytime soon. I'd hate to compare your movie selections to your Aussie counter part Heath Ledger.I was hoping to see a different movie here, one for adults or the less squeamish child. I needed Van Helsing to follow along the lines of 'Allen Hughes's From Hell,' 'Bram Stoker's Dracula,' and/or Sleepy Hollow. These movies were dark and had an eerie feeling. They as well as director M. Night Shyamalan prove that subtle suggestions and a brilliant story can have a greater effect, then CG and overwhelming media hype. I hope this movie isn't an inclination of this summer's silver screen newbies. I'm very skeptical of 'Troy' and 'Spiderman.' However, I'm extremely excited about the Village.",Van Helsing

Will Hugh be up for an Oscar any time soon? No..but it was entertaining all the same and it was worth the $4.50 I paid to see it. He delivered quite the performance and Kate Beckinsale did well too. I didn't feel that is was drawn out and boring like some of the reviews had said. I felt it was entertaining the whole way through and I liked that the whole movie wasn't exactly based on slaying and that it had aspects of romance and friendship as well.

788,Jack_Vykios,A Movie You Can Only See Once,5,12 January 2005,"I remember when I first heard of this movie. It looked great because: 1. I thought Frankenstien's monster might be a bit scary. At least a BIT. - Wrong 2. I thought that Hollywood would finally steer away from those annoying vampire legends (sunlight, garlic, holy water...), and come up with something inventive and realistic - Wrong I have seen worse movies, true, but this was terrible. I've seen it a load of times, because I couldn't really say ""no"" to friends who had lowered it down to Van Helsing and The Day After Tomorrow (which was one of those ""worse movies"").I agree with everyone's thoughts on Anna's accent; very annoying. I understand that she needed the accent because of where she was from (Transylvania), but the story, really, would have made more sense with more of a dark, travelling heroine. A woman who has been running from her hunters for many years, a woman who has seen he friends and family die in the snow, a woman who has escaped death by inches. We got a local.Jackman, overall, did his job - he wasn't that bad. No overacting, a traditional angry character, and a decent accent. I should say that I didn't like the religious aspect of his personality (I won't spoil the movie, but once the truth about him was revealed to me, it blew the movie), but, I suppose, that's just a point of view.I HATED the vampire women. The overacting they did made me wish for the movie to end quickly, because with all that screaming, crying and groping around Dracula, I just wanted to be sick with embarrassment. ""I spent nine bucks to hear a bunch of bad actresses scream their way through the auditions?"" Frankenstein's character was boring, period.The movie followed that same pattern with the werewolf: Becomes human again; tries to tell heroine/hero the truth about himself/his master; then suddenly becomes a werewolf - very predictable.With a very predictable storyline and unoriginal characters, this movie blew it. It had great potential, but just turned out to be another ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"". It's fun to watch the first time, but you'll find yourself strumming your fingers and checking your watch every other time you watch it. NOT something to buy.",Van Helsing

790,AER_Wilmington,Do not deride this movie for being enjoyable...,9,8 May 2004,"Van Helsing is, if nothing else, thoroughly enjoyable. No one in their right mind would have gone in expecting 'Interview with the Vampire.' This is, in truth, an action movie - and the plot reflects that. It is there, undeniably, to feed the action.And the action is good. The special effects are a bit cheesy at points (the brides-of-Dracula in flight, for instance), but it evokes adrenaline. It is fun to watch! What could be more important in a movie, really?
Now, this may destroy any credibility that I still have in the minds of some, but I also liked The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - for similar reasons. Van Helsing is like LXG on steroids: better effects, better plot (admittedly, that is not saying much), and - most importantly - even more monsters.

The worst acting comes from Richard Roxburgh (Count Dracula) and his three wives(?) they overact and can't seem get one sentence right.I can't understand why Sommer could cast these people, maybe the budget went to the effects (which aren't too lame, but not as good as in ""the mummy""). Sometimes in the movie they have parts that just don't belong or make any sense, It just takes up time.

I liked how he was put together. The Wolf man and other werewolves were awesome. I was surprised Van Helsing became a werewolf.Jackman was awesome playing Van Helsing. There would of been no one better. THE MUSIC WAS AWESOME!!!!!! This was the 4th time that Dracula, Frankenstein Monster, and The Wolf Man was in the same film.They were in only  House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, Bud Abbott and Lou Costello Meets Frankenstein, and Van Helsing. Almost everybody i talked to loved this movie.I didn't like Kevin J. O'connor as Ygor. (Bela Lugosi is the only good Ygor). That's the only thing i disliked. I had no favorite part it was all good.

793,WOLLFFEEY,Eh...,5,10 May 2004,"This just felt like an ""ehh"" kinda movie. There were so many special effects that I felt that the theater seats should have moved around, like in those amusement park rides. Dracula's wives were, IMO, the WORST part of this movie. I've seen better acting in high school plays. Campiness is good at times but they were beyond campy to being just dreadful. And those things that help Dracula, whatever they're called, looked like evil, demented Umpa Loompas. And Igor just had a horrible make-up job. And this Mr. Hyde business, can anyone say Shrek rip off?Okay, now to what I liked. Yes, shocker, I liked parts of this movie. The score was THE BEST part. While I may never buy the movie I'm seriously considering purchacing the music. I also liked the camp, when it was done well. But I found myself laughing in weird places.
*SPOILER*
I couldn't help it when Kate Beckinsale's character dies. The howl of the wolfman/Van Helsing just made me giggle. I thought it was incredibly funny. I don't know why.
*END SPOILER*
AND I liked Hugh Jackman although his accent threw me. I wasn't sure if he was trying to go for German or English or what. I've heard people say Kate's accent was bad, I think his was worse. Ah, but I didn't mind the way he looked. That HAIR! *faint* It's funny that anyone who had good hair never seemed to mess it up. Again, camp. Too bad there wasn't more of it, the movie would have been better. Campiness is what makes the Mummy good and that's why I like it.

Wrong!Looking at great trailers that have been released I barely couldn't wait to see if they've outdone themselfs by putting something commercial but nevertheless GOOD on the screen. As I've seen a pre-screener last night I can tell that the trailers aren't the best this movie had to offer. CGI-wise this is big fun. The movie starts out with this black and white sequence that ends up in an old windmill which I couldn't help to remind me to the Sleepy Hollow windmill scene. However, from this point on the movie just didn't slow down actionwise. It was fast, kept on going, looked really great and sounded even greater. A really amazing soundtrack with some catchy tunes danced 'round and 'round in my ears wich made this movie into a fairly enjoyable piece of expensive FUN.As expensive as all of this might be I think they saved a lot plotwise. The story is like 'Dracula for dummies'. Thinking that Spider-man had a lame storytelling I didn't think they could go even more wrong with this, but guess who got it all wrong? That's right, it was me.Don't expect to much when you go and check this out, but allow yourself to sit back, don't ask any questions, and enjoy this amusing ride.

But this Van Helsing has received a modern upgrade: He's stylish, supercharged, fast and loud.  To make it fair, Sommers has done the same with the monsters he battles (their lumbering counterparts from the 30's wouldn't have stood a chance).  Just like James Bond, Van Helsing roams internationally, fights evil, uses specially-designed gadgets from his techo-geek friend, and wins over the voluptuous love-interest, all at a breathless speed.  The film hardly pauses for some perfunctory back-story and character development, hurtling from one melee to the next.  In keeping with the breakneck pacing and dizzying visuals, the thundering score makes a full-throated `Carmina Burana' sound like an Enya CD.  If you love fast, loud, mindless summer movies teeming with CG monsters, this is a film for you!

I found him excellent in X-Men movies: here he does his best but his performance gets diluted in the poor quality of movie (read below).Kate Beckinsale ""acted"" or better, after seeing Underworld where she was fairly good, she was not at all properly directed.The script and dialogs were also lame and overall there is a lack of tension and involvement you would expect in a movie like this (at least as it is presented from the trailer). Moreover, it tried to be funny, but as I said, it tried...If it was really funny and ironic (a la Charlie's Angels) it would have been much much better. Some actors and vampires speak with a supposedly Transylvanian accent - they could have spared us that - quite useless.Special mention to David Wenham from LOTR: he was really good and funny - wasted as well like Hugh and unfortunately has a too a smaller role in the movie.Directing was not really good and wasted all the money and special effects (quite good) used in the movie. The plot is a transposition of Underworld (2003)...is about the SAME story just brought back to 19th century with the added (and to me completely useless) icon of Frankenstein...I will not buy the DVD.

801,syvergy,Probably the worst movie since Battlefield Earth.,1,7 May 2004,"Probably the biggest mistake most people make is excusing crap action movies, as ""popcorn"" or ""mindless"" flicks. Wrong. Bad movies are bad because they are badly made. Van Helsing prompted me to register on this site because my disgust could not be contained. This movie is utter crap.Lets do a rundown. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman, again, doing a moody, withkept ragged drifter character) is a monster slayer. He travels around Europe, with the support of the Vatican(?), getting rid of those that are deemed evil. After defeating one of these creatures (Dr. Jekyl, in a completely dumbed down, and, unfortunately, one of the better fight scenes in the whole movie), he is sent off to kill the ellustrious Dracula (Played melodramically by Richard Roxbury). Along for the ride is a no-name actor friar, as he repeatedly liked to be regarded, supplying such 19th centure weaponry as an automatic crossbow and a light grenade (anyone who DIDNT see when this would be used deserved to be shot), and awful ""comic"" relief.We're treated to about 10 seconds of backstory, which is just to introduce Kate Beckansale as the helpless heroine, and we're off on a ride of plot holes, bad CGI (except for the werewolves), horrible scriptwriting and just as horrible directing. Besides ripping off every single classic monster movie ever made, Director Sommers managed to turn the stuff he stole into complete dredge. One liners like ""We transelvians tend to see the bridge side of death"" and ""She's DEAD"" occupy the intelligence of 95% of anything said. It's all cringeworthy. As the movie wears on, fight scenes are repeated over and over again. The evil deeds, in which Dracula and his 3 wives (screeching away) wish to re-populate their dying kind, are repeated. Twice. We've never told why they need to electrocute wearwolves to do it, nor why Frankensteins monster, but they do. Twice.We also see our heroes plummit through walls, bounce off trees (without as much as a scratch), swing on ropes far, far too much, and manage to accomplish jumps and flips that would make the chinese midget from ""Oceans Eleven"" look impressed. But I'll be fair. The production values were enormous, and the sets, costumes and some of the CGI look fantastic. But thats it, they only look fantastic, when put into practical use, you can almost see the $130 million fall down the drain.I won't bother to go into any more of the movie's ""story"", since there isn't much more to say. The so called ""surprises"" are rolled over by explosions so you won't notice them, what happens to Kate Beckansale is simply retarded, and the ending is nothing short of, well, lame. Which, co-incidentally, sums up the entire movie.All in all, save your money. Do not see this movie. Do not even rent it. Instead, rent out some of the classics like ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" that this movie shameless tries to rip off. They may not be modern, but they are a hell of a lot better then this piece of commercially manufactured dredge.",Van Helsing
802,bscottmitchell,Van Disappointing,4,8 May 2004,"I, apparently like many moviegoers this weekend, had high expectations of this film.  It took all of 25 minutes into `Van Helsing' before I knew that I had made a titanic mistake.  Horrible CG, atrocious dialogue, slightly better than amateurish acting, and a totally predictable plot made this the worst movie that I have seen in at least a year.From the opening battle, though the ridiculous boxing match between good and evil near the end, the viewer is subjected to constant cartoon-like CG which made the monsters only slightly more realistic than a good Xbox game and far less frightening.  Even if I had been able to get around the action scenes-which seemed to always include someone falling from an absurd height, controlled by a series of impossible flipping maneuvers, and saved by a last minute grasp on a rope or a ledge-I could not forgive this film for ruining our classic monsters.  Dracula, by the way, was the least scary example of the character that has ever been seen. For me, bad accents ruin a movie as quickly as anything else. Most of the action in this movie takes place in east Europe creating an obvious need for actors who sound, oh, eastern European.  Here too `Van Helsing' falls way short of the mark. Kate Beckinsale (Anna), though stunningly beautiful in her early 21st century black tights, caused my ears to ache whenever she spoke.  Though not accurate, it may have been less intrusive if the director had made her speak with her native English accent.  Dracula (Roxburgh) was simply unable to render anything remotely passable.  The rest of the characters were so thinly defined and poorly acted that one soon loses interest in them or what they are saying anyway. Finally, though the story is illogically convoluted and poorly conceived, the viewer never wonders what's going to happen next since everything is given away before it happens.  About halfway through, the ending is spelled out right in front of the viewer and I still have no idea how so little story was stretched to two and a half hours.  My standard for a good story line is asking myself `Could I have written this?' If the answer is `Yes' the movie is a stinker....`Yes'A generous 4/10.",Van Helsing

Do I think the idea was bad? Not at all, in fact, I think Stephen Sommers had an incredible idea for this movie, but it wasn't pulled off. The animation wasn't believable in the least, and the acting (with exception of Jackman) was disturbingly bad. Not giving much away, there is a scene where a womans brother dies, and the only form of sadness she can show is a slight frown. I honestly don't plan on seeing this movie again... except maybe to see the 5 minutes I zoned out.",Van Helsing
804,sugarhigh61,I'd really like to punch Steven Sommers!,4,8 May 2004,"How many production errors can you have in one movie? One second he's got dripping, saturated  hair.. the next it's puffy and drying! She kisses Dracula with her really glossy red lips and not one spec of the gloss is left on him! Dracula asks the guy whose family was murdered by him to join him, and all he says is ""I'd rather die and than join you!"" talk about stating the obvious! The guy sees his fathers dead-for-a-year-or-more corpse and all he says is ""NOOOOO!!!"" no crying or anything... but then again.. he's been dead FOR A YEAR!!Suffice to say, that's the worst movie Hugh Jackman has ever done. Main role or not, that's a big bad chunk out of his popularity meter.",Van Helsing

I've got a 8 year old sister) Any one who has heard this is a awful movie, please reconsiter! Do not judge this movie until you have seen it. Please! If you're a comidy or romance or western ect. don't bother with this movie. The whole movie is full of action. There is also a lot of vilence. I love this movie.

806,bgoykhman,Silly fairy tale with too many special effects,3,5 August 2004,"I thought this movie was a bit too stupid. It's just not my taste... I only went because my wife likes this kind of movies. And, my God, what did they do to Kate Beckinsale?? In Serendipity she was such a sweet girl, and here she looked like a baywatch babe wearing a corsette and 15 layers of makeup. The way she was doing that accent was horrible: i guess it's not her fault, it just doesn't suit her. In general, her persona would fit better for romantic flicks or even serious dramas, but not for a$$-kicking dominatrix type roles. If not for Hugh Jackman, this movie would be absolutely and utterly pitiful, but he saved it just by his presence. Hope KB doesn't wind up doing this kind of movies permanently.",Van Helsing

For, as wonderful as I liked the acting, the humor (even a hint of a wolverine joke here and there) I felt the action was too ""busy"".  I'm not saying I don't like action, but it felt like there was just too much at once, so instead of concentrating and getting pumped up by the action, I tended to blank out a little from it.Personally, if it was up to me, there'd have been a little less action, and a little more about Van Helsing's past.There was however one part of the movie I felt was useless.  Do we really need to see a Friar having sex?  Sure, it was just hinted at (them waking up together, basically clothed) but enough already. GAK.",Van Helsing

They should pay YOU to watch this turkey.Perhaps those under the age of 10, may find some parts mildly interesting, but forget anyone with an IQ over 50.Absolutely the worst film I have seen in a theater in the last several years. If the soundtrack alone does not drive you bonkers, the bad acting and bad script surely will.Silly special effects were repeated way too often.Attempts at humor did not work.A mis-mash of older horror movies with many elements obviously copied from a wide variety of other films (not necessarily horror films).Never scary.Never enjoyable.Not even once.",Van Helsing
810,justanrmlcritic,Amazing what special effects does for people.......,6,16 May 2004,"After reading most of the people that say this is an ""awesome"" movie I find it hilarious how people get awed by special effects. The movie itself was just OK. Sure special effects are hard but they shouldn't make a movie good or ""awesome"". I was hoping a lot better of a movie. Acting was nothing special, plot sucked, and some moments that were suppose to scare people actually made me laugh... (like when Dracula screamed at his brides) Only decent part of the film was the special effects. Everything else was lacking. I left the theatre thinking that movie sucked. There is a lot missing in this movie. If the movie is so amazing might as well buy it on DVD instead of paying $16 bucks and the theatre and another $20 for the DVD.....",Van Helsing
811,jcatnight,Is it too trite to say that this movie sucks?,3,21 May 2004,"While I can't say I'd nominate the leads in this film for Academy awards in their previous roles, (XMen & Underworld) I did enjoy those films. Ditto both Mummy films, which I thought were carried more by the cast's charisma than the FX or the less than stellar writing. So I was optimistic about this film.I hate it when I'm disappointed. This film has very few redeeming qualities. I had thought that the second Mummy film had pushed the cartoonish action limit about as far as it could go. Wrong, it can go farther, but it shouldn't have.This film would have been much BETTER if they had spent $50M less on FX and $100K more on a single talented writer. And the same amount on nearly any other director.This completely cliché', wholly unoriginal and derivative weird mishmash of steam punk, vampire, werewolf, James Bond and superhero film is ... a mishmash. It has all the appeal of a cold plate of goulash combined with cabbage and ice cream, all topped with mustard.So, given its name, I think one can best sum up this film by saying, it sucked!",Van Helsing
812,harrisimo,Horrific script. Nice sets. Mainly rubbish.,2,4 June 2004,"How not to make film: 1. Inherit stable of well loved horror characters from Universal, each with their own fascinating (literary and cinematic) heritage and decide to throw them all into a film. Sounds promising....2. Ditch virtually all the well established lore and tradition surrounding these characters in favour of stupid unsatisfying premise and threadbare plot. 3. Receive 200 million dollar budget and decide to spend *all* of it on special effects. 4. Ask video game designers to come up with a dozen or so set-piece action sequences(shooting vampires with repeat action crossbow, swinging from rope to rope, obligatory coach-and-horses 'driving section'). Base entire film around these. 5. Cobble together a ""story"" that attempts to fill in the occasional few minutes between these action scenes with some sort of coherent narrative. Fail. Badly. 6. Realize story is so bad that film is actually a comedy. Sprinkle disastrous hotch-potch of story with lame attempts at humorous one liners. 7. Add 'comedy sidekick' character in vain attempt to distract audience from gaping holes in plot. 8. Add Kate Beckinsale in tight black trousers for same reason. 9. Demand all actors speak in a ridiculous ""generic foreign accent"" for that 'school play' hammy feel. 10. Throw in a few references to other films (Bond, X Men) etc. in final desperate attempt to engage audience interest.I genuinely feel sorry for the art designers on this film. They came up with some very impressive and visually stunning sets, only to see them employed in the service of a truly rubbish, rubbish story. Dracula had all the menace and charisma of an insurance salesman, and Van Helsing himself looked mostly bored. The only character with any semblance of interest was a sympathetic portrayal of Frankenstein's monster. Stephen Sommers needs to watch a few decent films, and take notes on how they establish and build characters and construct a narrative (almost any Spielberg would prove very instructive). Spewing out a dumb action film for yeah-haaah simple-minded teens with no attention span is soiling the horror canon. Please don't let this man direct or write anything else till he's at least mastered some of the basics of making a film, rather than ""some stuff that will look good in the trailer"".",Van Helsing
813,cpueditor,You have to see it to believe it!,10,2 June 2004,"I was skeptical about this movie from the very beginning. All of my fears and trepidation were soon allayed. This movie is great! It has action, special effects and it keeps you interested. Universal did a wonderful job bringing the gruesome threesome back for a modernized ""period"" piece. Hugh Jackman is great as Van Helsing and Kate Beckinsale is always a pleasure to behold. If you are a fan of the old Universal monster movies you should enjoy this one with out a doubt. I know I will be looking forward to the sequel! Another topic of interest is this movie was made by the same people that did the two recent Mummy movies....you will also note a couple of the supporting actors from those movies have roles in this movie.

814,benne666,"Werewolves, vampires and lots of monsters.... Yep it's a B-movie",2,24 October 2004,"First of all, I don't write many reviews. I only do the best movies...or the worst, So give me a break, it is just my point of view.Hugh Jackman is Van Helsing, a badass dude who travels around the globe to kill everything that has to do with evil. He has been sent to transylvania to kill Dracula that has been tormenting the country for centuries. Of course, things become complicated when he has to handle werewolves and a 500 pound Frankenstein. Owkay, this movie IS the badest movie of 2004. There is nothing good to say about Van Helsing. Bad sfx, lousy acting, and a plot that even the biggest moron would figure out. When you hear that Stephen Sommers is the director you always have to be very careful. We know that he likes to make popcorn movies like the mummy 1 and 2 and deep rising. So after the ridiculous mummy returns you should have been warned. Van Helsing is like a bad roller-coaster trip that lasts for two hours and when you finally get off you have the feeling that you wanna throw up. As for the special effects? My god, they are absolutely horrible. When Dracula's brides fly off, or when a man turns into a werewolf or even Mr. Hyde, you feel that there is something missing. They actually spend 160 million dollars and they didn't have decent sfx. What a waste.And how about the acting? Well there is not much to say about that either. It's completely rubbish and you will never believe that Kate Beckinsale is a roemanian (xcuse me for the spelling) gipsie. ""He is the firrrrst one to kill a vampirrre overrr a hunderrred yearrr, I say let's buy him a drrrink"". Yeah, Swallow that! As for Richard Roxburgh and Hugh Jackman...Guys what were you thinking? Conversations turn to the worst and the one-liners are really laughable.So now, you know. This is crap. Do not buy this movie, do not even rent this movie, do not watch it while you're drunk or stoned. Forget it, it will only be a waste of money. My star rating: 1 out of 5 p.s.

815,edward-padgett1,Big Blockbuster Clag Fest,3,30 August 2004,"**Some Spoilers**£5.80 that's a small fortune. There are several different things I could have spent this amount of money on, maybe a burger king meal, a paperback novel, a small amount of petrol, a large bag of jelly bellys, a fun fest in my local arcade or even some cotton wool to stuff in my mouth, eyes, ears and bum. All the above would have been more fun than Hugh Jackmans whack movie.Van Helsing is about the famous vampire hunter and his efforts to beat up Dracula and his cronies. Jackman play the rough tough vampire hunter, Richard Roxburgh plays Count Dracula and Kate Beckinsale plays a pair of breasts also known as Anna Valerious the female sidekick of Van Helsing. Also to mix it up a bit is David Wenham of the Lord of the Rings fame as the Q of the catholic world, oh how the mighty have fallenBasically the movie is about Jackman running off to Transylvania to kill off Dracula and save the world from all things undead. It's about two or three hundred years ago and old helsing is running around with laser guided crossbows and other ridiculous gadgets supplied by the lumbering monk David Wenham. When they get there it turns out Dracula's causing trouble, putting cats up trees and other minor offenses. On comes a battle with Dracula's three ladies at the night who attack in the afternoon. What results from this is a battle between Hugh Jackman and three goofy bat girls with big teeth. To make sure he takes these flying money-grabbers down to funky town he uses his ultra automatic crossbow which according to the manufacturers guide will 'Pin a donkey to a fence in seconds'. A ba-gillion bolts are sent shooting in every direction and before you can even say 'CGI-Fest' the fight is over. As the film goes on it turns out there is actually a reason for Frankensteins monster, wolfman and Dracula to be in one movie and it isn't a good one. So let me try to unfold this twisty and very stupid plot, Dracula needs Frankenbolts to somehow give life to his off-spring and wolfman is there to ermm, hmm I forgot. Anyway, Dracula wants to take over the world, yeah that's it! Take over the worldThis film boosts a massive budget, the amount of money that funds a small countries civil war! $4000 billion dollars last I heard, and it amazes me how a studio can throw so much money in the direction of such a idiotic project. Even more reason to fear this movie as an entertaining item is the fact that it's directed by Stephen Sommers of the dire 'Mummy movie's'. Oh god, this movie was never gonna be good.As I previously mentioned the film is a CGI fest, there are so many computer enhanced graphics in this movie that it's rumored that Jackman didn't move his arms during the shoot because it would have been more expensive and a cool fact to create CGI arms. Given the huge budget it would have been safe to assume that the CGI would at least be good to look at, but even this fails. The special effects range from pants to plain over-the-top, right up to Frankensteins neon head!This movie just sucks, it's Hollywood crud super-sized! The budget to stupid, the plot is even stupider and it's so over the top and as unbelievable as Big Dave tidying his room. I generally hated this movie and found it too hard not to laugh out loud at the dire dialogue and silly effects. I spent most of my time in the cinema making jokes at the films expense and counting the sweets in my bag.A classic example of Hollywood throwing stupid amounts of money into a crap summer blockbuster.

816,51stDate,What the Helsing?,7,14 October 2004,"Van Helsing, the arch-nemesis of Dracula, is reincarnated in this sloppy movie as a Victorian James Bond whose job is to be an all-purpose monster killer for the Vatican. Sounds bad? It's worse than that.As bad an idea as this is, it is poorly executed, with dreadful dialogue, underdeveloped characters, and computer generated monsters that are scary...not!The story is heavy on action, but since we don't really care about the characters, the villains are camp rather than menacing, and the suspense (it there is any) is constantly undermined by hamfisted attempts at humour (not funny) none of it counts for much. Which just about sums up the film.",Van Helsing
817,Inigomontoya2,The producers of this film should be shot.,1,25 November 2004,"I was in total shock at what i had just witnessed when the film was over. It was a mess. The action was directed awfully and the story was told very poorly. The pacing of the film seems to try to intentionally swallow up the boring story that sets at the base of the film. Hugh Jackman (which i don't like that much anyway) is dreadful as van helsing. They've turned him into neo from the matrix. I mean 21st century weaponry in the 19th century, come on! Kate Beckinsale who was great in ""Underworld"" (even though that wasn't the best movie) was very stale in this role. She almost seems to be auditioning for the part of frankenstein in the film.The ultimate poor excuse for a performance in this film belongs to Richard Roxonbourgh who plays count Dracula. He plays Dracula with a coe sense of fun, but it's not fun. In fact it's the fartherest thing from fun. He parades around with no emotional control and delivers his ""Wonderful"" dialogue. He changes shapes and acts a little too femine at times as well. Enough said about the acting either that or my head will implode. Well at least the special effects were great, right? NNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOPPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEEEEEE!God these effects were freaking terrible. Why cgi everything? Why not go back to the great films of the 30's and 40's.

It is done rather tongue in cheek and has some very funny moments. But what makes this film so interesting and entertaining is the breathtaking special effects and superb action. While to some viewers it may be flawed (for example the leading lady's hair is always perfect despite many altercations and assaults!), those of you who, like me, prefer to just sit back and enjoy as opposed to judging won't be disappointed. The vampires are the best yet, depicted with awesome detail and move about like nothing you've ever seen in vampire movies. Hugh Jackman (Dr. Van Helsing) is great for the part and Kate Beckinsale (Anna) looks terrific. The camera angles are spectacular and that combined with great action sequences keeps the movie moving at a perfect pace. If you get bored, you'd better stick to dramas and to those who feel they have to pan it, lighten up will ya! This movie does not take itself seriously, nor should you.

It was the day after a party, the one thing we were in mood for was a good movie on the DVD. We didn't have high expectations, but were sorely disappointed anyway.*** the following may contain SPOILERS ***It started out reasonably, until the so-called special effects took over. The scene in France with Mr. Hyde almost made me stop the movie. It was like putting in a cartoon character. At first I thought it was Quasimodo.Unfortunately the movie did not get better. The ""machine-gun cross-bow"" is a joke, so is Van Helsing's marksmanship - until, of course, he has to hit a bride, then he is suddenly very accurate.Another scene that was really bad was the brides chasing the carriage over several hours, flying up high in the sky, and yet they seemed to miss the other carriage 100 yards away - please... I could go on for quite some while but will stop now. I had high hopes for this title initially. They went down due to bad reviews from friends - so I decided not to watch it at the cinema. Still with my hopes being down, this turned out to be my biggest movie disappointment in a century :-(",Van Helsing

As a medically necessary antidote, follow this movie up with a chaser of ""Dancing at Lughnasa"" - or some other equally slow paced yawner - so that you can bear to make it through another unfantastical day of your normal, boring, real human life without unconsciously resorting to wrapping your teeth around some hapless unsuspecting co-worker's neck in search of a desperate shot of excitement - vampire style.No sh**, man! This single movie has enough computer generated graphics special effects to power a thousand pyrotechnical, body-morphing, fantasy world conjuring, beast-enabled fight scene plastered, adrenalin pumping, camera swishing, sorry-we-forgot-the-storyline action spectaculars. It's wall to wall on this one. Not content with a mere two hours of non-stop CG assault on your senses, they even found a way to squeeze entire full length computer generated action movie features between each frame. Try it. Slow down the movie enough on your player and you'll see what I'm talking about. It's insane! (OK, made you look. Nye, nye, nye-nye, nye) You need to watch this movie inside a hyperbaric chamber, being bathed in high pressure oxygen rich air osmotically carrying oxygen into your bloodstream, because there's just no good moment to take a breath. I'd like to see a version of this movie cut with 5 second pauses at 1 minute intervals. That way you could take a deep breath and hold it for every step of the way. Every minute there'd be a black screen with huge text saying ""Now breath in deep"". It would be released as ""Van Helsing: Survival Edition"", with the catchphrase ""Now You Can Breathe (TM)"".Alright, nuff said. Not suggesting that you avoid this movie. It was actually quite delicious to look at, and I had fun with it (I'm sure someone's going to ream me for admitting that, but WTF). By far the star of the show was Dr. Frankenstein's monster - the only real compelling emotional element in all of it. Van Helsing's sidekick also adds a bit of flavor, of the levity variety. Otherwise, it's just eye candy. But ever so schweet! It's kind of like in that episode of the Simpsons where Bart and Milhouse score a $20 bill and immediately proceed to the Kwik-e-mart to order a squishy from Apu that's made entirely from 100% syrup. Ingestion of said squishy sends Bart and Milhouse on a psychedelic sugar-induced trip and, next morning, Bart discovers he's joined the Boy Scouts. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I won't bother to go into the plot of this movie, since it's so minimal that even a mere sentence on the plot could be considered a spoiler. You have to see this movie to believe it. The visuals are just so unbelievably out of control. Who needs 'shrooms when you can trip out on this kind of stuff? Sure, the dialog is stooooooopid. Sure, the story is no more than a wee teeny tiny little idea adorned with a katrillion dollars' worth of effects magic. But, sweet eye candy... arrrrrrgrgggrghhghhhhhhhhhhhhhhh......",Van Helsing
821,trei-mlcs,Under Rated by most...,10,24 December 2004,I think this movie was very under rated by most critics.Most of this unfair criticism was due to the amount of over hyped publicity before the film's release.The plot line had enough deviations from the original Dracula/Werewolf/Frankenstien movies and was a really nice mixture that added depth to the character development process. Even after several viewings of the movie I still see things that were missed in previous viewings.The casting was very good and Hugh Jackman fans will really enjoy how he takes this character to it's extreme edge. The special effects were well planned and only in a few spots did I think they could have used live action more effectively.The use of black and white cinematography in the beginning was actually a very nice technique.The costuming was appropriate for the time period yet stylish enough to tie it to the modern era.The comic relief was well placed and the friar being similar to Q from the bond films was very entertaining.Overall it's a good movie for people that have very limited exposure to the horror film genres.,Van Helsing
822,temporaryinhabitant-1,Abbot and Costello get a modern melodramatic makeover.,1,11 January 2005,"What this movie lacked in originality was balanced quite equally with it's futile attempt to redefine the vampire genre. Color coded filters will hold your hand in an attempt to convey the mood of each scene while dragging you to the end of the movie, unless of course you are lucky enough to break free and run away.Like so many movies being mass produced, hyped up and pumped out, Van Helsing weaves an incongruent story around a painfully puerile script and ceaseless onslaught of special effects. The curse of Van Helsing is a strange combination Gothic science, metaphysical vapirism, and lycanthropy, a vision that goes not only unrealized, but becomes quite tedious early in the movie.I highly recommend warding off Van Helsing.",Van Helsing

The thing I liked about the film was the details. Hugh Jackman had cool clothes with a mystic hat! The village looked like it WAS in the middle-age, and I guess that was the meaning of it! Sure, I got a bit disappointed when Frankenstein was the ""Problem of the world""! That Frankenstein was important. I have always seen him as just a monster. Dracula was a cool character in this film. He was almost as I could imagine him. Almost! The Wolfman was scary the first time I saw him. Well, how would you imagine of a dangerous row of teeth would come against you in a rush? Anyway! I liked this film a lot, but I never would have guessed that Universal was ""responsible"" for it.

826,the_fuct_up_one21,Needs help,3,2 June 2005,"This movie really isn't all that great. If I could sum everything in the movie into one word, it would probably be horrendous. There were many problems I found, such as the animations, the plot, and the things with the monsters. Let me start by talking about the plot. This movie is far too easy to follow, as in, you can tell what is going to happen. It is not a movie that draws you in and keeps you interested, as I was wanting to stop watching after the first few minutes. I can not believe that people have claimed this to have wonderful action. There was not much thrilling action in it, and if there was, it was with animated characters, so the action lost most of its intensity. Also there is the problem of the animations. It is far too easy to tell that they are animated. When you animate something into a movie, aren't you supposed to make it look like it's real? These animations gave themselves away completely, compelling me to laugh when they were talking to the actors. It made me feel as though I was watching a children's cartoon. The biggest problem I had with the movie, however, was the monsters. The so-called ""vampires"" seem to follow every folk lore about vampires that exists (such as stake through the heart will kill them, they have no reflection in mirrors, etc.), yet they can still go out in the sunlight? Yes, most of their time is spent in the dark, but I don't understand why they can attack in the middle of the day. Finally, Van Helsing is rescued from becoming a werewolf by Anna, but yet, while she is giving him the antidote, he kills her. So, in the end, he ends up with nothing. Mainly all that occurs is Van Helsing going off to look for and kill Dracula (who really wasn't ever a vampire... another problem I had) and his ""children"" or all of the monsters that he has created. This movie is a fun, action packed adventure, where you can see animated creatures, go off to fight childhood monsters, such as Dracula and Frankenstein, and in the end, have nothing because the girl that you have (sort of) fallen in love with, dies.",Van Helsing

It's great. I just loved the actors they were great and very talented. It must have been very fun for them in this movie. I want to become an actress when I'm older and I would love to do a movie like this. I didn't think any part of it was dumb.

Although the storyline itself was good, the actual film seemed quite disjointed. A lot of the script dialogue was pretty awful and corny, for example when one of the vampires says ""too bad, so sad"" maybe it was the failed attempt of the actress, or maybe the dialogue was just truly terrible, either way it made me cringe!

I haven't seen a werewolf like that before in any movie. If you have seen tell me where it is! it was fantastic and realistic. When i've seen first time it was really made me scared. i have watched lots of movies titled ""horror, action, adventure, fantasy, thriller"" but never seen like this movie. Also soundtrack is good choice for the film.Hugh Jackman, finally made. I wont say anything more.When you are watching the movie, you don't care about time, scenario, casting anything. it makes u lock on watching it. Extremely i recommend it. 2nd movie would be great! I've seen the cartoon movie also. It completes the story. This film deserves winning awards.",Van Helsing
830,jackrogers66,A no brain flick for the masses,2,24 November 2007,"I saw this film in the cinemas with some Buddy's as we thought vampires and werewolves? what can be better? impaling ones eyes with a pitchfork thats what. On to the review. The film is just a mish mash of all horror movies of old and to a lacklustre effect,i wouldn't say the acting is awful but there wasn't any breakthrough performances and I'm sure the script didn't help much. Kate Beckinsales accent wasn't that bad but i believe the writers/director/producers only wanted her in this movie as eye candy which is wrong Kate deserves a lot more than that. Her character also seems to be invulnerable to all forms of pain and can Fall through tree branches from 30-40 feet and get slammed into walls without consequence. Then it looks like she forgot her cheat codes as she was killed by bring pushed onto a ....sofa..? wait wait wait hold up was her character allergic to velvet or something? i found this pretty ridiculous. Hugh Jackman comes in with the stereotyped cheesy one liner action hero which is what has been the norm for summer blockbusters to be honest. CGI has been a main gripe with some people I'm with Spielberg's FORMER conclusion of the less you see the better as too much cgi takes away from the connections with the characters. That along with the lack of character development really does pull this movie down. Watch this film if your in the mood for a cheesy popcorn flick but otherwise give it a miss.",Van Helsing
831,byoung119,A nonstop action flick for the fan of the unusual!!!!,10,11 June 2006,"Yes the plot is as thin a single hamburger at McDonalds, but who needs a plot when you have this much fun. This movie all your favorite monsters rolled into one story line. The effects were incredible and the sets were imaginative and striking. This is also a movie that pays homage to the classics as well as the comics. The lines were as fun as the movie and although predictable at times this movie takes you to a new high with the age old vampire tale. Hugh Jackman played the lead perfectly. The minute you see Kate Beckinsale you can't get enough of her. Richard Roxburgh plays Dracula up a bit but when given an opportunity to play the worlds most famous monster who wouldn't. I have seen many different spins on the Dracula story but this one ranks up on the top of the bunch for me. It is a great ride and I loved it. Not a kids movie.",Van Helsing
832,k-vissers,Horror stew in Hulk-vision,4,13 January 2007,"Hugh Jackman could have spared himself the trouble of trying to act among an otherwise cardboard cast and settings that fit the special effects - it all looks as tasteless as is barely acceptable in something like a Hulk-sequel. The script is mainly an inconsistent sequence of clichés from various, unrelated and hardly compatible horror traditions, turning the eponymous vampire-killer into a universal monster-slayer trained by a secret Catholic order as an orphan, with some other implausible twists. The genre normally requires accepting a few unrealistic premises, but here there is almost nothing beyond that to make it worthwhile. The result is rather infantile, hardly good enough even to be mentioned in the history of Dracula-movies.",Van Helsing

834,nvmoviefan,An okay movie,5,13 December 2006,"I don't consider Van Helsing as a wonderful movie, but it's not very horrible either. Some parts of it are entertaining to watch but you take a nap or daydream about something else during the other scenes. The problems I have with the movie are: storyline (not very good) and TOO much CGI and action scenes. I think Sommers intended for this movie to be scary, but unfortunately, it's not. It seems to be a LOT more of an action movie than horror.The problem with the storyline is, well, vampire babies??? Why couldn't the vampires just sire a bunch of people and start some kind of chain reaction. The only good part about the storyline is Gabriel's background and amnesia and connection to Dracula, but we don't see enough of that. Sommers tries to combine the stories of vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein's monster all in one movie, but it just seems like everything is simply thrown together. The only reason Frank's monster is there is for the vampire babies and the only reason the werewolves are there is because they are deadly to Dracula. Speaking of which, the issue of the werewolf antidote and Dracula's control over werewolves is very confusing. The acting wasn't bad, but the accents certainly were. The brides acted over the top at times.On to the good points. Visually, this movie is great. The architecture of the castles and buildings is beautiful. The monsters are all taken to the next level. The vampire brides turn into harpy-like beings and Dracula transforms into a gargoyle/bat-like demon (though it looks very CGI). The design for Frank's monster was really cool. The werewolves have huge fangs, move very fast, and transform by ripping their skins off! (But they also look CGI).Overall, I give it 5 out of 10. It would have been great if there were less over-dramatic action scenes and explosions and more attention to a better story that actually keeps you interested. I keep wishing that Sommers had made some kind of a psychological thriller with these characters. That would have been awesome and we would have a deeper understanding and appreciation of the characters and events in the story.",Van Helsing

Looking past the action, you see humanity, humility and mans capacity for cruelty but not in your face preaching on those things, just nuanced and subtle reminders of our being human and therefore capable of good and bad. Like I said, fun to watch, easy to follow and you can get the message pf your mind is open about humans and how we act.",Van Helsing
836,Grendel-29,The big hype,5,5 May 2004,"I was really looking forward to this movie. My friends and i rushed to the cinema to finally see it. We have all been bombarded with the advertizing of this movie, and the expectations were extremely high.The effects and sound were amazing, the storyline and the acting poor. I like Hugh Jackmann, he rules x-men. The effects in are as i said incredible, the digital stuff almost incredible, the humor is almost funny, the end is very predictable. I enjoyed the movie, but it doesnt go down as a classic for me, like x-men.TB",Van Helsing
837,Asparges,George Lucas - Vampire Slayer?,6,5 May 2004,"Well, this film really reminds me of the Star Wars movies. Why?The main theme is the fight between good and evil, but otherwise there is no real plot. You´ll see lots of fights, explosions and chase scenes, but not much else. The film anti-climaxes every ten minutes, usually because of uninspired (over)acting or extremely ridiculous dialogue. The CGI is flawless - it´s actually way too flawless - in this setting it should have been more organic.Oh, and the hero is totally unaware of his background, while the heroine is constantly dressed in sexy outfits, not particularly suited for fighting.Both Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale are talented actors, but unfortunately the chemistry between them is lacking. Richard Roxburgh is miscast as Count Dracula and fails completely to bring sinister qualities to his role. Fortunately, David ""Faramir"" Wenham as ´Q´ provides comic relief and something for the Lord of the Rings fans. And Dracula´s brides are rather fine eye candy.Maybe this is 2004´s first blockbuster, but it will not be the start of a new franchise. Too bad. But then again, at least that´s one thing it doesn´t have in common with Star Wars.

838,lerusse2,disappointing,3,12 May 2004,"I looked forward to seeing this film for months.  The film editors that handled the trailers should get an Oscar! Hugh Jackman is appealing- as usual.  But he alone, cannot carry this film. Some of the dialogue was meant to be funny- but we laughed at parts that were meant to be serious. The picture of Frankenstein's monster escaping on a home-made raft was just too ridiculous. And Kate Beckensale's Transylvanian accent was horribly laughable. Has anyone else noticed that her hair was never out of place?  Even after she was hanging upside down.  We actually laughed and applauded when her character died. I think that this film was meant to be a merchandising tool-video games, toys, etc.  Even so, I think that the film could have been much better.",Van Helsing
839,grav,A very silly film...,4,5 May 2004,"Van Helsing is great fun, but I fear that the humor is not always intended. It's sort of a cross between Indiana Jones, Tarzan and a James Bond film with vampires, wolfmen and Frankensteins monster. Weird, overlong and with a lot of ropeswinging... The film rips of pretty much every film ever made, but it's done so openly that it somehow gets away with it.Van Helsing really don't have a real script. The film is just a collage of actionsequences and scenes were the characters explains the plot to each other. There is really nothing for the actors to work with. That aside, there is no excuse for putting Kate Beckinsale in a film. She is a terrible, terrible actress. Yes, I know she is stunning, but she doesn't do anything but moan through the entire film. She is well on the way of becoming the female Ben Affleck, and that is not a compliment! The only character with a hint of charisma is Frankensteins monster. And that says a lot.Even after all this I kind of likes Van Helsing. It's so stupid and silly and really quite entertaining. It's boring at places, but that only serves as a pause to buy more popcorn. It's a fluffy, childish summerflick that is perfect for a ballyhoo crowd. In short: It's a Stephen Sommers film!",Van Helsing
840,avetro,How sad is this?,6,21 October 2004,"Well first of all I have to say that probably this movie targeted the 13 to 16 age group, because if not, then it is very sad. What ware the creators thinking? But just if you look what kind of movies Mr Sommer made before it all somehow comes back to you.Why did I watch this film? Well only because of Kate. I was more or less impressed with her Underworld so I was thinking this movie must be so much better. Sadly it wasn't.The biggest problem of this movie is that it doesn't know what it wants to be a comedy, kids/fantasy, a thriller, scary, CGI, horror/history or crap movie.There are only 3 good things about this movie: 1.Kate 2.special effects 3.soundEvery thing else spells disaster! 1.Budapest in Transylvania (since when) 2.Carl as Mr Q 007 3.Helsing as James Bond/Inspector Gadget/Buff 4.Big reunion, every body is here from Igor to Vladislav-who is he?On my scale this movie scores only a marginal 6 out of 10.Alex, ICQ 42208766",Van Helsing

I got the impression quarter of the way through the story that they were trying to beat their story home with a very loud stick.Even the transitional frames were filled with loud background noise. They barely giving you time to breathe. I like a good adventure and this had it's chances to deliver.But it came up short on story. If it were a peanut-butter and jam sandwich, it was almost all red-jelly, and very little bread and peanut butter. It wasn't satisfying, and didn't leave a good aftertaste.Not Hugh Jackman's fault, he's a hunk. And Kate Beckinsale has never looked more delicious.",Van Helsing

I thought they were exaggerating, and since I'm a sucker for vampire movies or anything else a little out of the ordinary, I decided to watch the movie anyway. This was my biggest mistake... It is all true. It is really is one of the most idiotic movies ever made. I am embarrassed for Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale. Were they blackmailed into doing this movie or something? It is almost like the director and writer were TRYING to make the worst movie ever made, (or if they were trying to make it like those silly 'B' horror movies from fifty years ago, they didn't even do that well). It had all of the ridiculous clichés, horrible special effects, and was just plain dumb. I was increasingly annoyed as the film progressed and kept thinking, are you kidding me? Did anyone spend even one cent to produce this ridiculous piece of crap? I most thoroughly do NOT recommend that anyone waste any of their time on this movie, perhaps one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen.",Van Helsing

Coming out of the cinema i feel like I've been punched in the stomach and had £20 robbed off me, i cant believe i have just paid MY money to watch this crap. First of all the storyline was a load of rubbish. Secondly the acting was rubbish (Jackman shone in bits but the storyline was that bad he couldn't have even looked decent.) The film has took bits and pieces of the best horrors and rolled them all up into a poor excuse for a film and waited and watched gullible people go to the cinema and spend their money on it",Van Helsing
844,jerry_48486,'Van Helsing',7,2 May 2006,"'Van Helsing' is, in my opinion, a very good film that stands on it's own. I realize that the director's intention was to tie this in with the Universal horror films made in the 1930s and 1940s, but he failed. For example: 1. In the 1931 version of 'Dracula', the famous monster-killer's name was Abraham Van Helsing, not Gabriel Van Helsing.2. In the 1931 version of 'Frankenstein', The Moster doesn't talk at all. The Monster in this film, however, speaks perfect English. This is a homage to Mary Shelley's original Gothic-novel first published in 1818.3. 'The Wolf Man', released in 1941, was not a topless creature that stood God-knows how many feet tall. The Wolf Man's hair is a brownish-hazel, and he wears clothes. The Wolf Man in this film has a brown-like color to him, and he is topless. Just a little thing I found.4. The Kate Beckinsale roll is not in either 'Dracula', 'Frankenstein', or 'The Wolf Man'.Visually, this film is stunning. However, I would have liked more make-up for The Wolf Man, and less CGI for Count Dracula (in human form). The acting is bland on Kate Beckinsale's part, but Hugh Jackman was believable.Overall, I give this film an 7 out of 10. If you are a fan of the horror genre, then you might like this.",Van Helsing
845,bystander-2,beyond the genre,9,4 July 2007,"Yes, this movie is a mess, lot of cgi, mix up of characters from vintage horror b-movies, restless action but not so thrilling... but this is just because the audience this film calls for is not really the target of what the story is about. In this screenplay I found a very interesting and original tale of good versus evil, full of subtle and deep insights. The presence of the Vatican is particularly important in this sense: the Catholic Church has investigated evil more than any other religion, for some reasons I can't reach. I would say it is a kinda religious movie. I would pair it to ""Stigmata"", another not flawless story about a very important religious issue, mistaken for just another horror/fantasy movie. While waiting for the masterpiece, I greatly appreciate that these movies tackle some important and neglected religious issues... even if this happens beyond authors' intentions.",Van Helsing
846,Tesla1907,Great Halloween fun.,9,28 May 2006,"Van Helsing is a reunion of classic monsters set to Stephen Sommers' signature roller-coaster pacing. It is a Saturday matinée treat which pays just homage to the Universal and Hammer studios chillers of the past, while introducing a new (and vigorous) slant on the title character. Thankfully, this is not a new era horror film, wherein traumatizing the audience is considered to be critical accomplishment. Instead, a likable and very capable cast usher the audience through this creepy fun-house of trapdoors and eerie shadows. When the lights come back up and the popcorn bags hit the floor, all is well.

The Vatican is an interesting touch, gave me a good laugh. It starts off the film in black and white, so you know it's the past, not the present, and it is true to both Dracula, by Bram Stroker, and Frankenstein to some extent. It provides laughs, moral issues, and hide behind the sofa moments to please any taste, and with the animated prequel, The London Assignment, what more could you want? However, much as I love the film, I was so confused over the whole Angel Gabriel affair that I just rented the book from the library today.

As it is, the plot is almost pretextual for the special effects.The Eye Candy factor is high, though. Hugh Jackman as the tortured hero, filmed in the dark all of the time, makes us weak in the knees. Kate Beckinsale does magnificent physical feats while squeezed into a corset.The story: Van Helsing (Jackman) is essentially a bounty hunter of supernatural monsters, a job he took on at the request of the church as apparent penitence for sins he cannot even remember. As a reward for his centuries of service, he hopes to make his way to Heaven instead of Hell.Anna (Kate Beckinsale) is the last survivor of a family of Transylvanian vampire hunters. Her brother has become a werewolf and she is conflicted about whether he should live or die.Naturally Anna and Van Helsing team up to rid Transylvania of the evil vampire overlord. Van Helsing has a tool kit Batman would envy, and Anna maintains an arsenal of monster-killing weapons that would make a survivalist proud. Between the two of them, the monsters don't stand a chance.Put your mind on hold, suspend disbelief and intolerance for the occasional leap of reason, enjoy a slightly randy friar (Van Helsing's sidekick), and go along for the ride.

I watched this movie 10+ times when I was a child, which makes me extremely biased. However, I rewatched it in a more conscious age, and I was surprised how creative the visual part of the movie. The iconic look of the vampires, laboratory with little dwarfs full of steam punk devices, the beautiful masquerade scene. It is such a well-put universe with its own remarkable features.And of course it has a few facepalm moments, but if you compare it to other action/adventure movies, I can't think about a better example.It is for sure in the top of my favorite movie list, and I don't see a problem having it among Shutter Island, Interstellar and The Killing of a Sacred Deer.",Van Helsing

The plot, or should I say lack of, is simply a device to propel continuing action scenes. The characters are flat, undeveloped and uninteresting. The attempted witty dialogue fails miserably. It is the most awful screenplay I've ever encountered. The directing was beyond horrifying, reducing the performances of Jackman, Roxburgh, and Beckinsale to cheesy, overacted stereotypes, and what is with Dracula's brides striking ""vogue"" poses in the background all the time? The only saving graces of this film are the special effects, action scenes, and the wonderful comic relief performance of David Wenham. And, unfortunately, these are not enough to make the movie worth the time or money required to see it.",Van Helsing

Ignore them, it wasn't made for them........ as the spearhead of the 2004 summer blockbusters this movie does the job. If you're looking for a film that leave you pondering deep meaningful thought afterwards this isn't the movie for you, I can't stress that enough. If you want to lose yourself for a few hours vicariously fighting monsters as Van Helsing or the lovely Anna then this IS the movie for you.Jackman does an excellent job as Gabriel Van Helsing (not to be confused with Abraham Van Helsing), monster hunter extraordinare and Kate Beckinsdale suffices as the female herione and eye candy.

The art design is phenomenal, the shots are well placed and excellent use of lighting and color and some of the best horror characters of all time.

I've never walked out of a movie before, I think it's foolish to judge a film unless you have seen it in its entirety. Van Helsing almost had me running for the door. Many people have pointed out that this was only intended as a summer blockbuster, a no brainer with big SFX, lots of one liners and plenty of merchandising possibilities. That's no excuse for this pile of poo...""Oooo, you cynical folk are being too hard on it"" I hear some of you deranged individuals cry...The Mummy had the same pitch as this movie, including the use of an old Universal monster. I liked the Mummy. The Mummy was good. The Mummy was fun. The Mummy was a well put together movie, its characters were pretty much one dimensional but everybody liked them. It had none of Van Helsing's frankly sloppy plot devices. A couple of cases in point:""Ooo, we're all going on a werewolf hunt""""Right lets plan this all real careful, like. We got the cage we got the bait we got our rifles. Anything else?""""Silver bullets?""""Good idea. But I tell you what, lets not put silver bullets in all of our rifles, lets just put them in one measly little revolver so that Beckinsale can almost get crushed by the falling cage as she runs to grab it.""

It had a real creative blend of Count Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and The Wolfman. Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, and the rest of the cast did a fantastic job of luring me into the monster movie country of Transylvania. I know why people consider it to be a horror film, but I really think it was more of an action film. The only part that startled me was the time that on of Dracula's children popped out of the cocoon, so the visual effects were real to me. The sets in the film were made perfectly and looked very real. Stephen Sommers, a great director, once again, hasn't let me down.

However the film could have lost one thing, the idea of Van Helsing. And The ""left hand of god"" however the film was greatly done. Sommers is a great director, for films like the mummy and the mummy returns. Those films, are a classic. And So is Van Helsing, i don't understand why people don't like the film. Why are people into ""gore"", its just boring to see that, its better with action/horror. Great visual effects. Perfectly done. I give the film 9/10 stars. The films introduction to Dracula was a great masterpiece and very well done, it certainly beats the other Dracula's along with their ""come and soon you well become a creature of the night!""",Van Helsing
870,vat960,Horrible - worst movie I've seen,1,7 August 2004,"This is the first time I am commenting a movie and it's not because I was positively impressed. I value my time, but I wanted to warn you that watching this movie is the worst way you can spend 2 hours of your life.I thought Spiderman, Daredevil and several other movies are the worst cinema can get. Well, today I understood that some people have a ferocious talent for creating awful movies.I didn't expect anything from the movie, yet the screenplay, acting, effects, love scenes, conversations... everything was so lousy, so plain, so pathetic.... Sometimes bad movies get so bad that they become funny. Well, this movie is a rare exception; it did not! It was pathetic and if I were not stuck in the middle of the row with people on both sides, I would have left after the 20th minute.If you are not a person who enjoys pain, DO NOT WATCH THAT movie and cause yourself so much suffering.I regret that I can't give it a rating of -10.p.s.

I loved the changes it made from the normal way we view the classics. Such as the change of the werewolf. Ripping the skin off is quite different from just sprouting hair. Dracula and his brides were great, too. The change from human to demon--the way they feed. I would not want to be bit be them.  I did think that Igor was scarier than the Frankenstein monster and I had hoped that they would have found a way to save Anna instead of killing her. I hope that in the sequel they explain more of who Van Helsing really is as well. The character of Carl was an enjoyable one. His added humor was a welcome touch. Overall I loved it and would recommend it to anyone.",Van Helsing
872,krysdouble,Just good fun!,10,6 November 2007,"I love this movie. At first glance all the plot holes and cheesy dialog are enough to make the purists run screaming into the night; but then you realize it is INTENTIONAL. Could they have made it uber-slick, uber-deep, and a character study to boot? Yeah, they could have. But it would have eliminated the point.The one-liners and escapism are in fact the point. Sometimes all the drama gets to be too much, a little campy humor is more than appreciated. Devotees of the Rocky Horror Picture Show might get a kick out of this. I am, and I did. It practically screams for similar treatment, it's that kind of a movie. I find myself saying lines along with the characters, and talking back to the screen a TERRIBLE amount, but if you can suspend your disbelief, that's FUN! No, it's not a serious look at Dracula. It was never meant to be.",Van Helsing

However, I was pleasantly surprised; Van Helsing turned out to be a good mixture of special effects, romance, suspense, etc.I lost count of how many times I jumped out of my seat when Count Dracula appeared out of nowhere, but other than that, Richard Roxburgh made a good Count, as Hugh Jackman plays a very good Van Helsing. Even with his faults (and he had a few), I found myself liking his character. David Wenham provided comic relief and more than once me and my best friend were in violent fits of giggles from some of his lines (we're only fourteen ... you do that at our age).The special effects were amazing, my favourite being the werewolf transformation. It was a bit gruesome, but very well-done a even lifelike I thought.In conclusion: for anyone into this genre, Van Helsing is defintitely a must-see!!",Van Helsing
874,rminto,Cartoon fun,7,9 May 2004,"Ridiculous stunts that defy the laws of physics and a simple one-dimensional screenplay drag this down. The action sequences could have been trimmed a bit, but it is surprising how well the single plot-line with short, go-nowhere subplots keeps its momentum. The atmospherics of the movie are good -- think Sleepy Hollow meets Two Towers. Jackman plays a very Wolverine like character. So most of this is a derivative hodge-podge of cliched eye-candy from other better sci-fi, fantasy and suspense films -- Matrix, Alien, X-men, Batman, James Bond, etc. Even Silvestri's Gothic-Wagnerian score sounds familiar from other movies. Nevertheless, it is fun to watch Jackman tackle various monsters. His female sidekick does an adequate job, but plays up arrogance and vulnerability and downplays the sort of intensity that the character needed, more in the direction of Linda Hamilton in T2, Sigourney Weaver in Alien(s).",Van Helsing

876,R71417R,Only Fleeting Glimpses . . .,3,5 May 2004,"Borrowing from a wide-spectrum of films, including James Bond, Rambo, Bugs Bunny, comedies and classic horror, Van Helsing is a film that does not bring the viewer IN.  You are never engaged.  Instead, you are disengaged by a goofy and thin storyline, almost never-ending noise and gratuitous special effects and ridiculous action scenes that are more filler than story progression.  Van Helsing is less film and more lengthy promotion for a future 'thrill' ride at one of Universal's parks.  As a ride, Van Helsing would be fun -- not scarey, not eerie, just an entertaining few minutes of fun.  As a film, it is very cartoonish, sometimes boring, often repetitive -- and a huge disappointment.  Or is it?  To be disappointed, one has to have certain expectations.  If you are aware that the director (Stephen Sommers) of Van Helsing also directed the recent films The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, your expectations were probably not that lofty.  If you loved those movies, and many did($800 million plus worldwide), you will be thrilled with Van Helsing.  If you thought those films relied too heavily on special effects and not enough on story or character development, you will see the same flaws in Van Helsing.  If you are a fan of the vintage horror films of the 30's and 40's, you will see glimpses of some outstanding visuals that harken to the images of those films.  And, you will see many of the famous monsters of those films, including Frankenstein's creation, Dracula and the Wolfman.  However, you will see only fleeting glimpses of what could have been a return to classic horror -- with the benefit of a huge budget (estimated to be in the $150 million dollar range).  Van Helsing is devoid of the creepy and eerie spirit of the vintage films and the frights of more recent offerings.  Special effects are the primary focus of Van Helsing and, as such, turn the film in to a lavish cartoon/video game, with no depth and not even any real thrills.  Even the aforementioned monsters are disappointing, with the Frankenstein monster looking pretty plump (he garnered laughs at the screening I saw), Dracula hamming it up and the Wolfman, looking less like a wolf-MAN, and more like an artist's rendering -- which is appropriate since he exhibits the ability to survive tremendous falls much like Wyle E. Coyote.  Unless you are a fan of loooong cartoons, Van Helsing, at more than two hours, will bore you more than entertain you and leave you wishing that the filmmakers had dug deeper -- not in to their pockets -- but, in to their imaginations to create a film that would have at least creeped us out and at best gave us some jolts.",Van Helsing
877,lorddominik,Indiana Jones meets Vampires: Los Muertos,2,4 May 2004,"I must admit that I am sadly disappointed to see this film produced in the manner it was.  It appears to me that Hollywood is focusing more on FX than story these days.  This film had the curse of a weak storyline being supported by a cast of actors that couldn't help resurrect it any.  If you are a fan of the modern works of Hugh Jackman (X-Men and after) you will find his acting to be on par for this role.  However, the character he portrays is not one that is worthy of Jackman's overall talent.  It is sad for me to say the most realistic and heartfelt acting in this film is done by Shuler Hensley (Frankenstein's Monster).  The role of Dracula is not what one might come to expect for a true lover of vampire movies.  A poorly written script offset with weak comedy cannot save this film from its most certain demise.  Unfortunately, it will most likely settle well with the younger crowds and the FX of the film and it's PG-13 rating will allow the younger audience to carry it to the upper ranks in the box office. However, I wouldn't waste the time or money investing in this film as an evening of entertainment.",Van Helsing

879,frost_byte101,The stupidest movie i have seen since 'Underworld',3,8 May 2004,"After watching this movie, you'll ask yourself, 'did they even read the script?' 'Was he(Stephen Sommers) even awake when he wrote the script?' SPOILER WARNINGThe movie starts out in b & w. Personally, I don't think it really needs it, but ok, sure. It's basically telling Dr. Frankenstein death story. Anything that happens in the first ten minutes of a movie, if told, i don't consider to be a significant enough spoiler to ruin the movie for somebody.The windmill that it happens in was made to burn. The whole interior is decorated with stuff that will help it burn. They are also in places, that would be pretty dangerous. Well anyway, that's the end of that.
Now, onto color. It starts out with, this was my first guess, one of Jack the Ripper's victims. Van Helsing investigates, and looks back at some big, huge, building. Ok, now I'm thinking, The Hunchback? Scene cuts to him up there, this entire scene contributes nothing, absolutely nothing, that I could tell, to the story. Once up there, you find out it's Mr. Hyde. Now, for the record, just about anything and everything in this movie is ripped from another one. Now, IMO, Mr. Hyde is just the opposite of the Hulk. He looks like he's there, but he doesn't look real. For Hulk, switch 'real' and 'there'. The scene that ensues is straight from any 007 movie. The people in this movie are also extremely slow, the monk/Q character has a device that is basically an artificial sun, he says he knows what it does, but not what it's for. It takes him till just before they really need it to figure out what it is for. For me, it took me negative two seconds to think, 'that can be used to kill Dracula, I don't see what the problem is.'I'm going to skip a lot of the movie till right before Anna and Van Helsing meet Frankenstein's monster. Now, i had totally forgotten he was supposed to be in the movie and with the dialog before the meeting I thought that there was about 10-20 min left in the movie. About 20 min later, with no signs of ending anytime soon, i thought, 'What the sh!t, this crap isn't done yet? F*ckin A.' It isn't even close to ending. You have about another hour left. Once you have though 'Ok, now the only reason i'm staying in this movie is to see it get better,' walk out. It'll get exciting, somewhat, and more stupid, but not better.Now for the major spoiler: For the plot twist, Anna dies, yeah. Then, if you think back and replay some of the things she's done in your mind, you realize that she could've took it. End of major Spoiler.Now for the special effects. Awesome. Dracula looks a little clay-ish, in his vampire form. But again, like Mr. Hyde, he looks like he's there. They work best in the dark where they don't have to put in much detail. And the transformations look pretty good, except for Anna's brothers when he's on the wall, i was asking how in hell he could stay up there. Kate Beckinsale looks great in the movie by the way. But it's not enough to save it by the longest shot anybody could ever take.Another thing, this movie is suppossed to be funny as comic releif. I counted five times i laughed. 2 of them i can remember. When Helsing asks Igor why he shouldn't kill him and when Anna says she'll cut off something. You'll get it. Oh, and His children look like Gremlins3/10 (Special Effects-2; Kate-1)",Van Helsing

It looked great, and, feeling I have to give credit where credit is due, I must say that it did not disappoint in that regard. The visuals and effects in this movie are, hands down, a 10 out of 10.It's a shame it has so little going for it otherwise.The plot, what little there is, takes forever to get going, and, once it does, sputters and dies shortly thereafter. From there on, it's your typical rescue-the-princess and kill-the-monsters romp that would be better suited to a late 80's video game than a blockbuster movie.The characters themselves aren't much better. David Wenham's Carl gets some good lines and comes across as likable, but the rest of the cast don't have much going for them, although I think that, perhaps given a script with a little more meat in it, the players could have sunk their teeth into the roles better. Another minus to the closing pyre scene, easily one of the cheesiest movie moments I can recall and really had no place in a movie such as this.So if you're the type that feels CGI and a bare-chested Hugh Jackman are the ingredients of a good movie, see it and you'll go home happy. But if you prefer fare such as plot development and three-dimensional characters, you would, in all honesty, be better off watching an episode of That 70's Show.Overall, a 6 out of 10.",Van Helsing

I recommended to my friends and they all loved it. This is the 4th time I have watched this movie, and I will watch it again. If Underworld can get a better rating, then why not this one?

The plot is very original, and is simple to follow, therefore it is in a way different from the other films about vampires, werewolves and ""monsters"". Obsviously there's always the same theme: fight between good and evil, but I've to admit the locations are really weird and the film has - in my humble opinion - an high level starring, apart from some bit players. Anyways, I saw the film twice: the first time in 2005 and the second one last year, and it was still exciting, I enjoyed so much watching it, and if anybody asked me to spend a night watching it again, I would: it's always a pleasure to watch this film, it's a mix of adventure, action and legendary creatures (Dracula, for example). So, if you're looking for an original and simple film, which has the mythical or the magical element and you like action and fantasy this one's for you. Of course this is not a colossal, but I think that it's incredible how it has such a low rating.

(However, if you are put off by guts and gore, then this is not your movie.)I wasn't looking for excellent acting in this movie, and so was not disappointed with the some-what canned performance of some of the secondary actors. I found Van Helsing's sidekick quite funny, and would have loved to see more of him in the film. Some viewers have been put off by Van Helsing's invincibility, but there is a softer side--emotionally-- to the monster- slayer that I enjoyed seeing in the movie.

How I judge whether or not a film is suitable to my taste is generally speaking, limited to subject matter and how I feel during the actual act of watching it. Obviously I am into monster stories/fantasies, so the reason I love it is because it moved me inside. The graphics were incredibly realistic, the scenery and characters (WOMEN) beautiful and horrible (the good kind) all at once, and the plot reasonably complex such that I was immersed into the whole world. My heart was racing.I honestly feel that this is a movie made by a man who is so passionate not only about movies, but beauty and horror. He was inspired by his father as a child to love the whole monster genre, but in the process to cultivate himself in the art of imagination. . . (he dedicated the movie to his father)I feel Roger Ebert describes the movie well when he refers to Van Helsing as having ""a world that is violent and hectic, bizarre and entertaining, and sometimes very beautiful."" I definitely want to hear Stephen Sommers explain why and how he created this world. Hopefully the DVD will supply some great commentary.sonb",Van Helsing
892,miter,Why bash this movie ?!?,7,11 May 2004,"C'mon guys! This movie wasn't bad AT ALL. And believe me, I know bad movies - last week I had the unexplainable urge to go to the theater and I saw ""The Punisher"" (man was that awful) and later on, since VH was sold out, ""The Alamo"" (you wouldn't believe it, but it's actually worse than ""The Punisher"").Now, compared to these movies ""Van Helsing"" was a MASTERPIECE. I mean, come on, nobody expected a well-thought story! Yes, the story is stupid. Yes, there are more than a few plot holes. Yes, the romanian accents were awful. BUT that's not what this movie is about. This movie is supposed to be an enjoyable action flick, and honestly it is. The action sequences are more than just good, the CGI is unbelievable and there are more than a few breath-taking scenery shots(the mountains/the canyon/the river/dracula's castle etc.). Even and the music was ok!So why bash this movie ?!? If you expected more than it delivered, it's actually your fault, isn't it? Just admit that as summer action movies go, this one is OK (at the least), and stop trying to prevent people from going to see it - I'm sure I'm not the only one that finds this kind of flicks enjoyable.",Van Helsing
893,merindo105,"Mmm, I didn't like it *Spoiler alert*",1,14 May 2004,"I apologize for all typos in advance! Again, this review contains many spoilers, so please don't read if you don't want to know. And, I really didn't like the movie, so there are a few (many) things in here which could be considered as mean. So, again, don't read if you cannot handle emotional criticism. The movie really frustrated me.Do yourself a favour, take the money you save for the ticket and treat your friends to dinner. Seriously, that was a bad movie. Period! Maybe I should stop here, mhhh, no!If it was meant as a bow to all the classic movies, they failed. A bow honors and maybe nodds with a twinge of irony but it does not try to copy. That is really the thing, they tried too hard to make it exactly like the classics but seemed to be very undecided if it should be parody or a serious remake. They took all the classic elements, threw them into a blender, fed the mix to a worm plagued dog and made the shit that came out into Van Helsing. (*that would be the mean part on my side)E.G. Dracula's brides were neither sexy nor overacting in a way that would count as a parody, they looked like the director dragged some gogo girls out of a cheap table dance bar and told them - be sexy, scary and uh, dunno, whiney?? And they did, except they tried to be that all the time and at once. The scene where V.H. gets his weapons is not even James Bond, its a Triple X copy except that it lacked the self-irony of the last mentioned. (and I grant XXX here more than it deserves, in my eyes)Here is my next question: was there a script?? If yes, please, Sommers, do the world a favor and transfer to stock exchange or tax attorney. I'm just trying to help. A plot somehow shined threw about one and a half hour into the picture but dissolved circa thirty seconds later. And the fact that I can't even remember what the plot thingy was, stands as a comment on its own. It seemed to me they cut together scenes from the classics without really thinking that it might puzzle or in my case bore the audience to death to see somebody or something falling from impossible height into a broad stream which happened about every fifth scene, they gave wolfie hell that way, but Igor got his share in the end. Now that I think about it, the movie would be perfect for a drinking game: take two drafts everytime somebody or something falls from a great height, take three if it falls into water. You would be dead drunk after an hour.Speaking of plot, Dracula's castle. The only entrance was in the gipsy's house and except for D. and his brides the rest were unable to fly. I wonder how they got the equipment to the place without looking a little suspicious. I see the track of little helpers trampling through the house: ""Hello"", ""Hello"", ""Sorry about your carpet"", ""Hello"". And you know what, if they had made it like this, I would have considered it funny, but they didn't. There were so many holes in the story, it makes a mash shirt look warm and cozy.
Dialogue *sort of: ""Thank you"" says Kate Beckinsale's character, with way too much make-up marring her otherwise pretty face, and the monster goes ""AWWWWWW"" with a look on its mask, that may have meant ""Aw, nice"" but somehow felt like ""Aw, kick in the nuts"". Which leads to the absence of, well, acting really. The actors either were to busy wondering ""How the f*** did I end up in this crappy s***"" or looked like ""Have to fire my agent"", I got this notion everytime Mr. Jackman's character fired his gun. And wasn't that character build up nicely or what: The Arcangel Gabriel lost his memory of who he is and turns into V.H., monster killer for all religions in the world and turns wolfman, kills his arc-nemesis and his lover *tackle - oh my, she  is dead awhooooooo - I laughed so hard* and than lights up a funreal fire, like a beacon in the night. And than came the clouds.. and I fell off my seat positively hysteric by then.I seriously hope the pay checks were obscenely high otherwise - go kill yourself or buy a shirt which says: ""I was in Van Helsing and can still get a job in the industry...You want to touch me? I'm a miracle.""
Granted, you don't go and see a picture like that for fine acting or the plot. The Special effects were in fact nice,.. except it was too much. Why did they even waste money on actors at all? And sorry, but if there are actors I expect at least some sort of acting and some sort of plot - both were hard to find in V.H.Not even David Wenham who was the only one who really tried and did good, could turn this movie around into a passable parody. I'm sorry for all lovers of the classics and I'm certainly sorry for the fine actors who were wasted in this crap. And I'm really sorry because I was forced to waste more than two hours of my life which I will never get back.",Van Helsing
894,ultimate_ed,Sommers had too much money,5,8 May 2004,"Being a big fan of Sommers two Mummy movies, I was really looking forward to this one.  The Mummy movies were poorly reviewed, as Van Helsing was, so I wasn't discouraged.  While I can't say the movie was bad, it wasn't great, I'm afraid.I think the great weakness of the film was that Sommers just had too much money to work with and didn't have to make any decisions.  If you listen to the director commentary for the Mummy and Mummy Returns, you hear him talk about the choices they had to make and the tricks they had to pull because of limited budgets.  I think Sommers did very well with those constraints. After seeing how he behaves on an essentially unlimited budget, I think he needs the constraints of a tight budget to be effective.As a general case in point, CGI was limited in the Mummy movies and Sommers comments on how much it cost to get effects shots done.  This time around, the effects shots are so numerous and overwhelming that they detract from the overall experience.  Instead of being there to advance the story, they are there to simply impress.  It's unfortunate, because the price paid is in plot and character development, of which there is sadly very little. There's just not enough substance to make a connection with Van Helsing and Anna, the way you do with O'Connel and Eve in the Mummy movies.I'd recommend this one as a rental.  I own the Mummy movies on DVD.  I don't expect this will be joining my DVD library when it comes out.",Van Helsing
895,Jaqfrost,If you have seen one you have seen them all sort of...,3,4 May 2004,"I think that the hype for this movie has billed more as a horror than it truly is.  Truth be told it comes off as a cross between Adams Family Values and Underworld at best.  Many of the effects are interesting but not necessarily appropriate.  Some of them threw off the time period of the movie especially the Frankenstein `monster'.  Then there is also the fact that the costumes are never right for the time period but this one took the cake, especially when it came to the Masquerade Ball costume of the sidekick.  Then there is the drawing from a thousand other films.  The Brides of Dracula rather reminded me of harpies as portrayed in other films. This film is at best a film for renting and watching when you are sick and tired of watching Friends or Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Although I must say that I did see at a sneak preview and it was nice to not have to pay for it, even at the cheapest rental price.This isn't to say that it doesn't have entertainment value but I guess I have become spoiled over the years.  If you can handle a vampire ridden, Mark of the Rose-ish Melodrama then you are good to go.",Van Helsing
896,prafulljagtap45,One of the underrated gems,7,25 April 2013,"I don't know why this film was doomed by critics and people. I am not talking about box office collection. This is one of the most underrated movies of its genre. I like this movie and I love huge jackman, plus supporting cast was good.I personally love this kind of tongue-in-cheek, change of the usual film.Maybe movies timing was bad, because pf spider man.If people looked at them more as just visually entertaining with a bunch of sharp one-liners, and tried to stop making them the next big action movie, or trying to read a life change message somewhere in there, they'd have more fun! I loved the real mix of actors appearing in this movie - I was straight to IMDb after watching it to see if I was right or wrong about who played who. I especially liked the straight-in beginning - no credit break to kill the run of the film. The black-and-white beginning, going to color soon after, was not new, but echoed nicely with the old Hollywood movies that the start was echoing. Altogether, a great fun watch.",Van Helsing
897,Kamphey,"The first scene was great, except for the rest of the movie",1,8 May 2004,"Note: See Scorpion Kingsaying that, I have to say that the very first scene in B/W was absolutely fantastic.  I was so thrilled to see what was coming that I almost missed the entire movie because It was just bland.   No well developed plot twists or plot for that matter.  Hugh Jackman running around trying to kill dracula for two hours is not very entertaining when at the end,  he kills dracula. Kate Beckinsale was in the movie for some T and A  even though there were three other as gorgeous if not even better T and A already in the film. There's your ubiquitous comedic characters.  The lowly monk who gets sent into the field after been inside for his entire life.  Ends up helping to end this horrible film.my favorite part of the movie was when it ended.  not the end.  but just the last second that it ended.  I got to run out of the movie theatre as fast as my feet could take me.",Van Helsing
898,LilPixie04,Monster Movies; Gotta love 'em!,10,9 June 2004,"A lot of people have criticised this film for being too cheesy and not loyal to the original characters, but I think it is one of the best films so far this year. I'm a big fan of classic monster movies, and director Steven Sommers has taken the best of the big bads and modernised them to make a great kick-ass actioner. The costumes are great (a certain Miss Beckinsale looked fabulous in those boots and corset), the sets were breathtaking (I won't spoil anything but those of you who have yet to see it, keep an eye out for Dracula's Masked Ball!) and the movie even succeeds in making the audience jump out of their seats several times. Well, it worked on me anyway!I only have one quibble and that is about the dialogue. Some of the lines are a little cringeworthy when heard, but there is always some great action sequence just round the corner to distract you. And though the characters don't exactly stay true to their legendary status (Sommers bent a few rules here and there) the movie still works well, and to be honest, I don't really care if it's not like the previous monster movies, and I'm sure many others won't either. Change is good, after all!In short, this is a great action adventure film that's fun and fast-paced, with added eye candy for both guys and girls! So damn the critics, go see Van Helsing, you'll love it! It's just pure entertainment!",Van Helsing
899,ceedge,"Put a stake in this movie, PLEASE!",1,5 May 2004,"Quite possibly the worst movie I've seen. Ever. Worse than LEAGUE OF EX GENTLEMEN, a movie that also really ticked me off. I went in hoping it would be fun, and be an homage, in a way, to the Universal films of the past. But no. VAN HELSING is a bloated, wasteful, soulless,bone-headed and arrogant mess - a perfect metaphor for everything that is wrong with the film industry, and, dare I say it? with our country today. Instead of loving and honoring its source material, this movie is disdainful of it, and uses lame, over the top,in-joke references from Aliens, Terminator, Rocky Horror, Star Wars, and yes, XMen to try to elicit humor. It is a noisy, shrieking, clanging, exploding CGI mess of a movie. God forbid there be any characters with any depth, or a plot that doesn't telegraph every cliche that it is about to commit, or that any iconic logic regarding Vampires, Werewolves or Frankenstein monsters be maintained. And it perpetrates perhaps the greatest sin of all - an annoying and completely uncompelling Dracula. And don't even get me started on the ending. OMG. The ending. People in the preview audience were HOWLING with laughter, it was so unutterably bogus. I am playing Hammer's HORROR OF DRACULA right now in an attempt to clear the miasmic haze of stupidity that VAN HELSING left in my brain.Peter Cushing, Chris Lee and Terence Fisher, we need you now, more than ever!",Van Helsing
900,zorroscurse,Never shall you be bored,9,7 May 2004,"If you are a fan of the classic horror films, you will enjoy this film. Van Helsing does its work with its epic soundtrack, lively characters, and jaw-dropping special effects.  However, there are things wrong with it. The best way to give it an honest review is to break it up by its characters.
Van Helsing: Well portrayed, but the back story was rather choppy, and made little sense.  Anna: Kate Beckinsale makes a viewer fall in love with that face, body, and physicality.  The trailer does not give her justice--the accent is much improved.  Dracula: Richard Roxburgh had the opportunity to perhaps be ranked in the top 3 Draculas of all time.  Though, for what he had (another illogical storyline and at times lackluster lines), he did well.  His CGI was above average.  Frankenstein's Monster: An overdramatic portrayal by Shuler Hensley.  Get past that, and you have another fine character.  The Wolfman: Will Kemp is very good in his movements, but reminds the audience that this is his first hack at a big film.  Note: The CGI werewolf had me swearing and pounding everytime I saw it.  Carl: Whimsical, at times charming fellow.  Most would say he stole the show, but I will leave that for the werewolf.  The Brides: Sexy... gorgeous... vicious... well done.If the viewer can get by the director's overdone CGI (save the werewolf, of course), and choppy scripting... then you have a good film.  Dracula and Van Helsing's backstories are not well thought out. The Monster was a little over the top.  The werewolf will blow your mind. I'd see it twice, thrice... (Note: Dracula-fanatic reviewing the film)8/10.",Van Helsing
901,teemonster,"Lighten up, kick back, and enjoy yourself!",10,8 May 2004,"Something I seriously dig about Stephen Sommers: He's honest as a director and a writer.  In THE MUMMY RETURNS, Sommers dressed Brendan Fraiser in a leather jacket and Fedora as a response to critics of THE MUMMY that said Fraiser and Sommers were trying to be Indiana Jones. When he made THE SCORPION KING with WWF sensation, The Rock, over half the film included brawling or one-on-one fighting of some kind.  So with VAN HELSING, Sommers opens the film with an angry mob wielding pitchforks and torches. The first spoken dialogue: ""It's alive! ALIVE!""  And finally, it's shot in black and white.Come on, folks, if you don't know EXACTLY what kind of movie you are about to get, then you are expecting way too much from VAN HELSING.This movie does not disappoint. It delivers exactly what it promises: a monster mash! Dracula.  The Wolfman.  Frankenstein.  Igor. This is a ""Who's Who"" of movie monsters, and while a story featuring so many Hollywood heavy-hitters could come across being contrived, Sommers cleverly works it all out in a tight little story.  Unlike HELLBOY which had so many plot holes (provided you could figure out where they were going with it) you could drive a battering ram through them, VAN HELSING unfolds the plot layer by layer and then takes you on a massive roller coaster ride with everyone hanging on for dear life. This movie will make you jump, it will make you laugh, and if you're not careful, it might put a lump in your throat.But Sommers, while doing all this, is being VERY HONEST as he does all this. Much in the same way PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN did not think itself anything other than a pirate movie based on a them park ride, VAN HELSING does not try to be anything else other than what it is at its core: a salute to monster movies. And not the over-the-top-gorefests like David Cronenberg's THE FLY, John Carpenter's THE THING, or any NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET offering...Sommer's salute are to the classics from Karloff, Chaney (Lon, not Dick), and Legosi.  There are also some nostalgic salutes to the classic Hammer House Films that featured Price, Lee (Christopher, not Bruce), and Cushing.  There is even a little nod to James Bond.  And while all this is going on, Sommers adds in dialog at the beginning of the film that clues you in...Igor (to Dr. Frankenstein): Master...you have been so very good to me, you have been so very kind...(points to Dracula) but HE pays me.This is your clue that this movie should not be taken seriously.VAN HELSING is coming under a lot of fire from both critics, moviegoers, IMDB users all screaming ""it lacks originality"" or ""it's a mindless mess of special effects.""  These are people who are approaching this film as you would approach Kenneth Branagh's FRANKENSTEIN or Francis Ford Coppola's DRACULA .  Approach VAN HELSING like that, and yes, you'll be sorely disappointed.  Approach VAN HELSING as you would ARMY OF DARKNESS or BIG TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA, and you'll have a ball.  Let MATRIX:RELOADED/REVOLUTIONS and HULK try to be important, poignant, and meaningful...VAN HELSING is a monster movie... ...and it's having a great time being one!",Van Helsing
902,BigLitz,What in the world...,1,12 May 2004,"What in the world were they trying to do with this movie.  It was a great idea, and good action, but the dialog was absolutely horrendous.  ""But you're suppossed to Die""  ""But I want to Live""  ""Okay.""   It was either a 6 year old wrote this script or they didn't bother to write a script at all. I won't even get started on the incredible amount of errors in this movie. The writer/director might have well smack the viewer across the face with some of the mistakes they let slide. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed in this movie after looking forward to seeing it for some time. I can only hope that we will not see a sequal to this mistake. Or at least get a new writer and director who can actually do this good idea justice.",Van Helsing
903,darkclaw316,Crap on a stick,2,11 May 2004,"This movie is absolutely atrocious.  I had high hopes that Van Helsing would kick off the blockbuster season, but my hopes were dashed as I sat through this mindless drivel.  The movie was extremely disjointed and had too many things going on at one time.  As such, it seemed like they changed from scene to scene every couple of minutes which never allowed any part of the storyline develop satisfactorily.  With such a poor script, the actors were working at a major disadvantage from the outset.  Hugh Jackman (X-Men, X-Men 2) did as well as he could in the title role, but this movie was so poorly plotted and written that no actor had any hope of saving it.  Kate Beckinsale (Brokedown Palace, Underworld) portrays Jackman's love interest, gypsy princess Anna Valerious.  Beckinsale's role appeared to be to walk around in a tight leather outfit and to talk in a horribly stereotypical ""gypsy"" accent.  Richard Roxburgh (Mission Impossible:2, Moulin Rouge) plays a horribly ineffective Dracula.  Roxburgh's Dracula comes across as wimpish and not as the embodiment of evil that past movie Draculas have been. David Wenham (Lord of the Rings) is horribly miscast as Van Helsing's assistant, Carl.  The only saving grace of this film is its use of CGI to create visually stimulating scenery and monsters.  If the film had been written and produced by a Hollywood novice, I could understand.  However, Stephen Sommers wrote 1999's The Mummy which is one of my favorite films.  Of course, taking into consideration that I was disappointed with his follow-up efforts in The Mummy Returns and The Scorpion King, I shouldn't be surprised.  I give Van Helsing a meager rating of 1.5 out of 5 stars. Save your money for some of this summer's upcoming films and wait for Van Helsing to hit video if you really must see it at all.",Van Helsing
904,Penny_Murdoc,Waste of money,3,22 May 2004,"This movie has exactly two good thingies in it: the talent of Hugh Jackman and the nice looks of Kate Beckinsale. The rest - well, no story, awful effects...I should have spended the money elsewhere. For a movie that was that expensive it looks like a B-Movie. It also feels like one. It was a great idea somehow. To bring all the old monsters together, against a newish Van Helsing. Besides him, a beautiful lady with a real task. But the director wasn't able to do anything good with the script which as well was full of holes. If there just were good special effects, then i would have said, great action movie. But even this failed. The guys of ILM didn't have their best day at all.",Van Helsing
905,BigEvil69,shoulda woulda coulda been A LOT better,2,7 May 2004,"Don't go into this movie expecting much. In all honesty I'd wait for DVD or cable. There's not much here except for eye candy: even that looks like it belongs more in a video game rather than a movie screen. The movie tries very hard to weave together subplots and to build some amount of compassion for the characters but fails miserably. Comparisons to last year's equally disappointing League of Extraordinary Gentlemen are not far off. Both films lack substance and rely mainly on flashy visuals and predictible stories to occupy their audience's time. A lone high is the film's opening, which only serves to make the rest of the movie an even bigger disappointment. A big letdown of a summer movie but not all that surprising given that writer/director Stephen Sommers is also responsible for the equally vapid Mummy movies.2/10 (2 points for a rather decent opening sequence)",Van Helsing
906,avidichard,Gorgeous special effects and rareness in transformation,8,6 February 2015,"I don't know why people gave it such a bad rating. I don't recall a lot of movies that have pushed the transformation process of Dracula from it's human form to it's vampiric form. Nor have we seen a human transform to a werewolf with tearing flesh. And the final fight where Van Helsing as a werewolf transforms from one another and Dracula constantly transforming is just well done. Oh, and did I mention that this is NOT done in dark environments like any other such movies? We actually SEE in full light the transformation process of human to beast! It loosed it's points for the music and the outside churchy story but the rest was just fun to watch and, and I bought the blu-ray disc so that closes it pretty much!",Van Helsing
907,bandedkrait,Saw a Sneak Preview - Loved it - Load of fun.,10,6 May 2004,"1. Oscar caliber?  No.2. Enjoyable? Yes.3. Special FX are better than Spider-Man or Hulk, which is surprising considering the budget the other 2 movies undoubtedly had.
4. Cool ass monsters?  Yes.5. Scary?  Not really, but there are about 3 scenes that will make the entire audience jump.6. You know how most summer blockbusters, like The Mummy, show you too much in the trailer, and when you see the movie, you feel as though you've already seen the cool parts?  Not the case with Van Helsing.  Even though we have been inundated with trailers, they have wisely left out a LOT.
7. Jackman? Awesome.8. And thank GOD he doesn't use martial arts.  I'm kind of sick of EVERY vampire hunter knowing Tae kwon do.  And the only thing worse than the vampire hunter knowing TKD, is when the vampires he's hunting know it as well.9. Does Beckinsale redeem her incredibly beautiful self from Underworld? Believe it or not yes.  She is good in this.10. Every humorous moment is actually HUMOROUS, and the entire theater will erupt in laughter, almost to the point where you miss the next line because of the noise.  Now that is well timed humor.11. Is Frankenstein cheesy?  Only in the trailers.  You will be surprised at how cool he is.12. Same with the Wolf Man.  He looks like a goofy CGI cartoon, but once you see him in action, he's a little creepy, and the end result is, it works.Chances are, if you're even CONSIDERING going to see it, you will like it.

I just got out of the cinema and I am still feeling the adrenaline rush into my veins. There is not even a single moment of rest in this movie. Just when you think that Hugh (Jackman) and Kate (Beckinsale) can rest for a bit after being chased by some vampires, another monster appears before them.

The ideas were there, and there was the glimmer of the movie it might have been shining through from time to time, but for the most part I laughed with incredulity at how poorly it was executed. The CGI was terrible, the design of the monsters left an awful lot to be desired, and there was no dialogue or characterisation beyond what was necessary to move on to the next ""big set-piece"".

The previews for this film looked pretty good, and the premise sounded interesting as well: monster hunter takes on some of film's most notorious bad guys.  I figured this would be a fun ride, so I plunked down my cash for an opening-day matinee.  I wish I hadn't....Unfortunately, Van Helsing is one of the worst films I've seen in years. The plot is surprisingly uninspired, character development is weak, and the major conflict of the story is so dull that I couldn't wait to get out of the theater.  The action is like a bad video game, packed so full of miraculous stunts and escapes that it is utterly absurd.  Any sense of tension when the main characters face monsters is lost fairly early in the film and never recovers.  Halfway through the movie I was checking my watch and counting down the minutes left in this 2 1/2 hour long disaster.Was anything good?  Well, some of the special effects were OK.  There were a couple funny lines.  That's probably about it.  Frankly, it's not even worth a rental.

The acting was flat, the story line practically non-existent, and there was zero chemistry between the characters, especially the male and female leads. Not that the actors had much to do. The CGI effects completely dominated and doomed every scene. With every explosion, every hideous metamorphosis, every miraculous near-miss, I kept thinking, ""Well, there's another ridiculously expensive special effect that adds nothing to the movie."" After a few minutes of this, I started dozing off. IMDb readers, don't waste your time or money on this. If you crave CGI effects, watch ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".

Let me tell you that 'League' is a masterpiece compared to this movie.Hugh Jackman actually does a pretty good job, by himself.  Everyone else just reeks of overacting.  It's not necessarily their fault either, as I'd be more inclined to blame the horrible script.  The first hour is simply bad, and after that it only gets better because you've already invested that first hour; might as well see how it ends.This movie fits the definition of ""mindless action"" to a 'T'  Go spend your time, and your money, somewhere else.",Van Helsing
915,ultimatept,Wonderful Movie,9,1 August 2012,"It's one of the most action movie I ever seen.This stories takes,always us to a time of fantasy with monsters and heroes.The fantastic work of the actors with the story makes this movie one of most entertaining movie such like last action hero.My vote is only 9 in 10, because I would like to see more,like a squeal and is always possible to see better, but in this case I doubt.The weapons,and the atmosphere of Transylvania is other beautiful thing to the movie, with castles and the endless battle between the good and evil.",Van Helsing
916,Biage,The worst movie 2004,1,8 May 2004,"I saw the movie yesterday and i have to say i hated it. The dialogs were crap an the special Effects looked like in a computer game.I thought Hugh Jackman will be good in the role of van Helsing but he looked and talked like 3rd class actor. Also the performance of Richard Roxburgh as Dracula was laughable, thought he he should be scary, sexy, and intimidating but i thing he is nothing of these things.There are so many more things i hated in the movie:Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious, David Wenham as Carl, Shuler Hensley as Frankenstein's Monster, Elena Anaya as Aleera, Will Kemp as Velkan, Kevin J. O'Connor as Igor, Alun Armstrong as Cardinal Jinette, Silvia Colloca as Verona, Josie Maran as Marishka,
and the whole story.
So one thing.Don't watch this movie.",Van Helsing
917,JayJo900,"Funny, scary",8,13 June 2004,"Van Helsing was a man who couldn't recall his past. Working for the Vatican, he has to hunt down supernatural creatures and it is to Hugh Jackmans' credit that Van Helsings' reticence at killing these once human beings came across.The rest of the cast are good, particularly David Wenham as Karl, Gabriel Van Helsings' Friar sidekick. The banter between the two characters provides the many funny parts of the film. Karl is also the provider of the gadgetry and weaponry used by his friend Van Helsing.Richard Roxburgh surprised me. Before seeing the film I thought he was badly cast as Dracula, but his performance was a mixture of mad, aristocratic menace and camp egomaniac. The role actually seemed to suit him.Kate Beckinsale was the feisty heroine. As Anna Valerious her ancestry indicated a long-standing vendetta with Dracula. She thinks she can handle things on her own, but after seeing Van Helsing in action, she reluctantly agrees the Van Helsing can remain in her town and eventually, together, they set about ""vanquishing evil"".Will Kemp as the Wolf Man didn't really have much to do with the role, except writhe acrobatically about, which was a shame. I would've liked to have seen more screen time given to both the Wolf Man and Shuler Hensley as Frankensteins' Monster. Although Frankensteins' creation was supposed to be a ""monster"", he was in fact quite the opposite, an emotional and sympathetic character.The sets were very atmospheric, dark, gloomy and Gothic, perhaps a tribute by the Director Stephen Sommers to the old Hammer Horror films?The only thing I would've changed about the film? Well, at times, it felt like the film was trying to cram too much in. It would've been nice to have a plot that was less crowded and maybe that would've allowed for some interesting development of the characters.Yes, there are a lot of things that could've been done differently, but I enjoyed Van Helsing. It's a film that is funny, scary, action-packed thrilling and entertaining all rolled into one.",Van Helsing
918,nadav-levi,Dracula wasn't the only thing that sucked,1,24 May 2004,"The first thing I can say about VAN HELSING, is that for the first time I have witnessed a side effect of vampirism  not only do they suck the blood off of you, they also suck your acting skills. What was Sommers thinking when he casted that group of community-theatre z graded actors, who cannot even maintain the same accent for more then one scene? The name of the title should be VAN HELSING  ADVENTURES IN OVER ACTING. It was the first time a fantasy movie can be accused of bigotry  the use of monsters stereotypes was borderline racism! What's wrong with some originality, why not try to, I don't know, something that wasn't done for a gazillion times? Couldn't Sommers find a new perspective for an already repeated Dracula/Frankenstein/Were-wolf story and outline? He did such a great job with THE MUMMY, why didn't he take the same great formula he had and just transferred the monster plot to it? For god sake, they didn't even a little bit of comic relief  nothing to ease the pain! You just cannot maintain a PG monster movie with absolutely no blood and gore without something for the soul! The lack of humorous relieves, combined with a bland story line that features nothing new, added to one of the most bad and ridicules acting performances (I am talking especially to you Kate Beckinsale and Richard Roxburgh), and you have one of the worst movies ever made, a stale experience at best, with a lesson to be learned for future directors  CGI is not a substitute for a plot or for acting quality. If I want to see that  I'll go play a game on my PS. I can only hope Dracula didn't see that movie, because if he saw it, I'm sure he'd want revenge. 8.5 on OMEGA DOOM Scale.",Van Helsing
919,dookiy,Van Helsing meets lots of other movies,6,13 May 2004,"Don't read if you want to keep all the surprises. *little spoiler alert*Great movie if you like the scared by surprise effect. In Van Helsing we see the Mr. G van Helsing as a lean mean vampire ass-kicking fighting machine. There are a lot of questions in my head after seeing this movie like:-Where have I heard before something like the bad guy's father is the good guy? (I thought it was the other way around somewhere in a galaxy far far away...)-Same moviesixtology; since when do we always burn the bodies of dead people? (Qui-Gon Jinn it was if I remember correctly. A pity ending for Ms Beckinsale.)Wasn't there another movie in which the good guy had the ring of the bad guy, while the bad guys ring finger was chopped off? (In both the bad guy won't get it back by the way...)And so on, and so on.You should really go for the effects, it is quite a shooting, hooters helicopters-film, only no helicopters... guess they weren't invented yet then.But in stead you get loads of other flying thingies.",Van Helsing
920,akaqueenofhearts,Absolutely fabulous,10,10 May 2004,"I was very reluctant to see this film, but my family dragged me off to see it(It was better than the other option- Scooby Doo 2). However, I was drawn into it immediately, and rooting for Van Helsing all the way. I loved Dracula, his wives were incredible, Anna was awesome, and Van Helsing? Well, let's just say that my previous love for Hugh Jackman has intensified tenfold. I will buy this on DVD as soon as it comes out! Go See It! It's Incredible, and the stunts are soooo cool! Kate Beckinsdale, who I haven't really seen much with her in, was such a cool Anna, and I loved her interactions with Van Helsing.",Van Helsing
921,PunchDrunkTorrance,Soul-sucking Sommers,4,8 May 2004,"You'd think it would be impossible for Stephen Sommers to sink lower than the cinematic abomination that was The Mummy Returns, but somehow, he's done it - this endless barrage of phony CGI effects is a tough slog to get through. The effects (particularly the animation of Dracula's brides and the werewolves) are atrocious, but the shockingly poor animation of Mr Hyde at the beginning made the Hyde from League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen seem like Gollum. This basically comes off as a poor mans League, right down to Richard Roxburgh prancing about as a hammy villian. Hugh Jackman is okay, but less charismatic than usual - and Kate Beckinsale is wasted in a role that again requires her to do little more than pout and look pretty (that's pretty much all she did in Pearl Harbor and Underworld). But it's really Sommers who should take the blame for this - relying too much CGI and ridiculous action scenes that never seem remotely real (especially the carriage chase scene) that you really don't care. I'm all for a good, dumb, tongue-in-cheek blockbuster (the first Mummy was one of the best in recent years) but I really hope that this isn't where this type of film is going - movies that are little more than souless video games.",Van Helsing
922,mstockton_2000,Uggh...,2,21 December 2004,"Easily one of the worst movies that I have recently seen. Good effects, but every movie has good effects nowadays. Terrible plot, terrible acting/script, and it was SO long. This one ranks with the ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" as one of the biggest bombs I have seen. There was not much plot development and the story seemed to jump a bit. However, when good met bad, the scenes took FOREVER. It seemed like Dracula just kept getting away and the movie kept going. Dracula seemed to be a bit too campy and Frankenstein was one of the wimpiest/most sensitive monsters I have ever witnessed. If this was Hugh Jackman's chance to make it as a leading actor, then he certainly picked the wrong film!",Van Helsing
923,andymeyer,Completely Derivative,1,17 May 2004,"This movie was absolutely awful. When Hollywood is set to invest 160 million dollars in a project one would imagine some small fraction of that would be spent on a decent script....evidently not. Everthing...the look, characters, and plot points of this film are lifted from other, better movies. The director seemed to feel that no exposition was necessary, we would all go along with whatever preposterous premise he chose to splash on screen. So the fact that Van Helsing is part of a secret organization headquartered at the Vatican which employs Buddhist monks and Muslim mullahs didn't need any explaining, it passes by with barely a mention so that we can get to the next chase scene. It all went down hill from there. YAWN!!!I left the theater feeling I had been duped by the Hollywood spin machine into spending my hard-earned money on drivel.",Van Helsing
924,nocambie78,Oh. My. God. !.,1,22 May 2004,"What in the name of all that is sacred was that about? The company is only interested in getting a bigger audience(reducing the certificate, hence depriving us of what could have been a decent, if certainly not great monster movie), Stephen Sommers - he made Stargate, didn't he?, Hugh Jackman wants to be the next Bond so badly he obviously couldn't wait, Kate Beckinsale should start acting at some point in her life (what with Pearl Harbour, Underworld and now this), Richard Roxburgh tries too hard ... and I could go on. Apart from that, all the questions brought up by the screenplay are left unanswered (I won't reveal anything), the dialogue is plain awful, and to be honest the whole premise in which the movie is based is preposterous - I can't believe the Vatican hasn't reacted. As for the special effects, I seem to be the only one that noticed the blue screen pretty much throughout the whole movie. And, what's with the music? Could be the most irritating score in (and for)a long time - certainly not what I expected from Alan Silvestri. I tried to sleep through it, and I couldn't, so I decided to wait and see if something good would come (it does, without revealing anything, it's the wolf man transformation), then I tried to get my money back, but working in a cinema myself, I never paid in the first place, so now I am aiming to sue all the parts involved for emotional distress. The worst movie in history? Surely not. But pretty close, nonetheless.",Van Helsing

It definitely didn't live up to the hype. Even Hugh Jackman couldn't save this one. My only thought as I watched the movie was, ""I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater or I would be upset at the waste of money.""Thank Goodness I have a Blockbuster Pass and so this really was a ""free"" movie. I would have hated to spend a nickel on this one. The ONLY good thing was that Hugh Jackman had a cool costume, and one of his weapons was pretty cool too. The acting and dialogue were horrid, clunky and all around bad. This is a razzie contender for sure.",Van Helsing
926,joelliott,true,10,12 August 2004,one of the best films i've seen in years. I took my mum to see it in may for her birthday and she loved it. The effects were amazing and jackmans portrayal of Van Helsing was brilliant. The man is a natural. Some of his fight scenes reminded me of him as wolverine in x-men. The atmosphere in the cinema was amazing. Van Helsing has such a dry sense of humour. When Helsing turned into the werewolf then back again all the women in the cinema had to catch their breath as it's not every day you see jackman in shammy leather. Jackman even did the voice over the animated film. I hope there will be a sequel to this as i will be first in line to see it.,Van Helsing

DON'T go see it, you'll be sorry if you do. and i didn't even get a refund for leaving in the first half hour because i thought it would get better. my friend and i had to spend the next hour and a half or so that it dragged on talking about how retarded it was. so don't see it.",Van Helsing

One moment I was like okay... slap-stick hummor, but... but then; it's like 'holly *&%^#'... I jumped here and there even though you could just guess what was going to happen.

930,kreifel6,"Too much ""cuteness""",5,7 May 2004,"I must say I was really disappointed in this film. I can't say that it was a complete waste of time but it certainly wasn't what it could have been.There were simply way too many attempts at ""cuteness"" in the movie. The little comedic moments occurred far too frequently and seemed forced. The frankenstein monster was more reminiscent of Young Frankenstein than of the monster of the classic sense. In fact, the opening scene of the movie made me think I was watching a Mel Brooks moment. The little window with the neon lights over the monsters heart would have been more appropriate in a Wizard of Oz remake.Jackman did a respectable job and I thought Beckinsale delivered a good performance as well. Roxburgh unfortunately was one of the most unbelievable Draculas I've yet to see and Igor looked more like Nick Nolte's mug shot from his DUI.What was up with Mr. Hyde? That was possibly the worst part of the film. Whoever thought a 10 foot tall Incredible Hulk clone was a good choice to model Mr. Hyde after should seriously be looking for a career change.Okay, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it WAS a complete waste of time.",Van Helsing

The story is inconsistent, mixed-up and with no hesitancy to use stereotypic techniques to underline the story.Secondly, the directing is based on making lots of cool scenes without any content. You have it all: Large castles, mountains high and valleys deep, a sequence with a masquerade ball - of course with no really meaning. Fight scenes that last longer than a big box with pop corn.Thirdly, the acting is unbelievably poor, especially Kate Beckinsale - it is unbelievable how bad the accent is; in addition the she comes out and says this stupid things again and again during the movie.",Van Helsing

A lot of FX, many action, nice beauties trying to act and a more or less acceptable story line. I think, the worst thing was the syncro into german, or some silly dialogues. But, there were also some good things to mention: The end was surprisingly, the characters are interesting and overall it was a good pop-corn-movie but only a second class film. I was a little bit disappointed about some silly parts, especially the questions ""Why Count Dracula tried to get children?"" or ""Why only the Wolf Man can kill the Count?"" or even why the story of Van Helsing's past hasn't been answered completely. Perhaps, there will be some answers in a sequel?...It has failed to be as good as ""The Mummy"" (my quote: 8/10), but it wasn't really disappointing.7/10",Van Helsing
934,nheto2,Shallow and Failed Experiment,4,10 May 2004,"The movie Van Helsing starring Hugh Jackman, who has had a pretty good career so far by doing such films as X-Men, X2 and even Kate & Leopold, fails miserably to impress even a monster loving enthusiast like myself. The story gives no respect to the actual historical events and connects three different stories of Wolfman, Frankenstein's monster and Dracula into a mixture that no one should have to swallow, if they haven't already. I'm starting to feel nausious. There is much to say about the movie from fail-to-impress script to the misfortunate directing job done by Stephen Sommers etc etc.... I personally could not believe how many times I wanted to get out of my seat and leave thinking that someone out there has approved such an atrocity to be released as a motion picture. Life is unfair and so are the previews that made this movie seem decent enough for an evening out. Au contraire mon frére! I will go now and forget all about this sad, sad night.

And if you did hate it that bad, why did you stay for the whole thing.

The one problem with this whole story is that when I was coming out of the theater, people didn't get some parts like who Van Helsing really was ( which i got) and why only a werewolf can hurt the Count (Which I got)?

I'm not a monster movie person, generally, but the story and effects were good enough to overcome that.  Unlike the Matrix, the effects didn't look like a Playstation game or overdone.  There are elements of an Indiana Jones battles Dracula vibe, but not plotwise.  There weren't many slow parts as the action seemed to role right along with the story without seeming forced.

Kira Knightly can no longer complain about wearing a corset after seeing the outfit, Kate Beckinsale is forced to wear throughout the show. I have heard that Universal wants to make a franchise out of this movie. Luckily for us, this move isn't made like that. It is a complete story not a set-up for future ones like the first Spiderman.

Richard Roxburgh does a great job in his role as Dracula, making the Count an easy character to hate.  Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale shine in their roles.  However, the gratuitous romance scenes seemed out of place. The cast of characters (monsters) are well though out, and mesh with the story well.  Some comedy is thrown in, but not too much - just enough to get a chuckle every so often.

And, for those of you who are now saying to yourselves, if it's that bad it might be fun to watch you are wrong. This isn't like Ross Hunter's musical remake of Lost Horizon which was fascinating in it's badness, it's just stupid. It's not even worth watching for the action or the effects, they suck too. Why is it so bad? Hmmh. There is no plot, no dramatic arc, no interesting characters, no interesting character interaction, no redeeming good performance by one solitary actor and shot after shot after shot was cribbed from other films including Alien 3, Alien, Terminator, The Killer, etc etc etc. It is not even an homage to the old Universal films. It's obvious that the ""writer/director"" (I use those words because technically that was what Stephen Sommers was hired to do) had nothing but contempt for those films, and a complete misunderstanding of what makes those films work, or he couldn't have possibly made this film based on them. He gave Frankenstein's creation the power of speech to make him a whining self martyring pain in the ass. Vampires can walk around in the day time. A werewolf would turn back into a human if there is passing cloud cover over the moon, no really cloud cover, a Vampire hunter who can shoot hundreds of arrows and not hit a moving target in the heart, another vampire hunter who never carries stakes or any weapon that can destroy a vampire and cannot fend off a vampire by herself, and a village full of people living under the constant threat of being a vampire's next meal, who when they hear the sound of hundreds of beating wings at night, go outside en masse to see what's there!",Van Helsing

The action started from the beginning of the movie and just kept going, stopping just long enough for me to catch my breath. Don't expect a movie a deep movie with lots of dialogue and character development but rather expect rollercoaster fun with the movie.With the wolfman on his back and the brides of dracula attacking him from the air makes you wonder why is it so hard to kill him.Even a dracula that can't be killed by stakes through the heart, holy water or crosses is no match for Van Helsing.The special effects on this movie was better than movies in the same category just watch the final sequence as proof.",Van Helsing

The effects were very good although the movie relied on it too much but it still made Van Helsing a good movie. The female vampires were really scary by the way. The lines were also not very good because they mixed our time with the time in the movie. And also in near the end when the moon was blocked and Hugh Jackman turned back into a man Dracula didn't kill him or even run away like he was trying to do when Hugh was still a wolf, that part didn't make sense at all. Also didn't you notice that when Van Helsing was a wolf he was bigger than all the other ones, that also didn't make sense. Thats all I have to say, It was good but not really good, because it was actors versus the effects, and lets face it some of the actors didn't do too good but Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale compensated for that. That's why it is only good and not really good.",Van Helsing
948,yk_kurama88,The Best I've seen this year so far(some spoilers),9,7 May 2004,"If you like movies like Lord of The Rings, X2, Matrix, etc, especially a fan of Vampires, you'll definitely love this movie, I personally rate it 4.5/5, its CGI doesn't lose out to movies like X-men and Spiderman, and the plot has lotsa twists, the only few parts that's kinda is the clothes of the Vampires changes with their body.. =S, some parts are a little too fast that u cant catch the story, but overall, it's a reeeaaallyy great movie, the creatures are brilliant and Dracula's brides are really cool, I esp like de part when Kate Beckinsale says ""Next time when you kill people, don't talk so much""  2004 doesn't have many movies that makes people cant-wait-to-see it, unlike 2003's Matrix and LOTR, but this is definitely one of the best I've seen this year, and Hellboy, supposedly its 'nemesis', p-a-l-e-s in comparison",Van Helsing
949,johnnox,It's a bad pantomime,3,7 May 2004,"Badly acted, too much CGI, no heart, this a laughable poor mans The Mummy Returns.The audience laughed at all the wrong bits, particularly at the end which was supposed to be the most emotional part of the movie.At two hours, this could have been cut by at least 45 minutes as it drags on too long.From the opening scenes, you can see how bad this is.Dracula himself is as scary as Dale Winton, Frankenstein's monster is camp, only the werewolves are any good.The main problem with Van helsing is that it takes itself too seriously, and this can't be backed up by the CGI or the script.Either it should have been made as a kick ass scary 15 cert, or as a PG.With a 12 certificate it flounders in no mans land.The only saving graces are Kate and Hugh who do their best with a script which is, at best, apaling!Avoid like the plague!",Van Helsing

To boot, it also reeked of last years Summer movies.If you take LXG, X-Men, any James Bond movie, and Underworld, put them in a bag and shake, you get Van Helsing.There was very little in the movie that was original, and there was very little in the movie that was memorable.Once again, we see Kate Beckinsale fighting supernatural creatures.The special effects were good, the plot was non-existant and the characters forgetful.  After the hype, I was expecting this to be a new path for future Van Helsing movies, but, I think i'd skip the others.This definately one to wait for on DVD.",Van Helsing

952,LeeluDallas,"Ho-hum, and some more",1,7 May 2004,"Written and directed by Stephen Sommers (known for movies such as `The Mummy' and its successful sequel) one would expect `Van Helsing' to run along similar lines as its predecessors.  Unfortunately, this next installment in the Sommers Saga, somehow does not live up to standards set by the previous hits.  The main characters in the film appeared to be one-dimensional adaptations made for the popcorn/ bubblegum audiences that Hollywood counts on for Box Office success.  Whilst this formula seemed to work on `the Mummy', there is something missing of the '6 parts Action, 4 parts Comedy, 3 parts Horror and 1 part Romance' recipe of preceding attempts.Dracula was portrayed as a garish, over-the-top revision of a character whose infamy had once made him one of the more feared creatures of literature.  Here, he felt to me simply as a cartoon version of the real nature of what many of us will recognize.  His Brides on the other hand were irritating - I'd always come to think them as being frightening, yet seductive beings, being the underworlds representation of sirens.  Here they are bad actresses disguised (poorly) by computer generated images, worse dialogue, and terrible accents.That being said, the title character himself was quite delightful to watch. Van Helsing's comedic talent, cavalier attitude and general Byron-esque heroic tendencies did leave this audience member rather pleased.  However, due to Jackman's earlier movie choices in X-men and X-men 2, the similarities in Van Helsing and Wolverine were of course made - no spoilers will be revealed here, suffice to say that the drums of imminent misfortune play faintly in the background.His love interest, played by the stunning Kate Beckinsale, is simply that - a love interest played by a captivating i-am-so-ballsy-stay-out-of-my-way sidekick.  A woman, who one might add, doesn't wear very appropriate clothing for wintry conditions.  There's comedic relief, in the form of Van Helsing's Little Helper (a.k.a. Carl - played by the talented David Wenham!) who I must admit got a few laughs out of me.  Other peripheral characters were much the same, that is, they were the stereotyped clichés that we are all accustomed to seeing.  The addition of further literary legends was a little absurd - Dr Jekyll/ Mr. Hyde for example?  Why is he involved here? Confusion abounds.All things considered, the film was relatively enjoyable, if by enjoyable you mean a night out where judgment and any reliable thought process must be left at the bathroom sink.  It delivered large doses of action and broad comedy followed closely by a few startled gasps (ok, maybe not a few). After all, what more can you expect?  This is Hollywood, where the men are men, and dollar signs rule their world.Rating: 3/5",Van Helsing
953,satellite25ca,Discussing the many things wrong with this film.,1,8 May 2004,"Van Helsing, starring 'that guy' from the X-Men, 'that girl' from Pearl Harbour, and a bunch of computer animated monsters is one scary movie. What scares me the most is the fact that this movie was written, and then real actors agreed to play the various roles.  I can't imagine that this movie looked good on paper.  The plot is non-existent, the dialogue is awful, and the way the dialogue is presented by the actors is monotone and disjointed. Every bad movie cliche can be found in one form or another in this film. The plot just doesn't make sense, and it seems that the writer (Stephen Sommers) came to a couple points and didn't know how to get out of them, so some bizarre realization was made and everything worked out.  The chemistry between the hero and heroine is also non-existent, and the progression of their relationship is both confusing, forced and therefore, unbelievable. The only good thing about this movie was that I thought it was 2.5 hours long, but it turned out to be only 2.  I don't know if I could have sat through another half an hour.  Save yourself a few dollars, DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE.",Van Helsing
954,barb_french,"You're supposed to suspend disbelief, not hang it by the neck til dead",5,8 May 2004,"If you like frantic action and some really spectacular movie-making from a special effects point of view, see Van Helsing in the theatre and don't wait for it to come out on DVD -- it's too big for the small screen. However, if you like your action spiced with a good story and compelling characters, and you are bothered by glaring inconsistencies, see something else. The story is just barebones and dry -- go kill Dracula. The characters are all cookie cutter, with almost nothing at all original or compelling. Even Van Helsing's own story is hinted at but is left for the viewer to wonder, but is NEVER resolved (I hate that).There is an unexplained three-week skip in the storyline; how else do you account for there being two full moons separated by only two apparent days? (they handled a time transition very badly). Why is lycanthropy interrupted by clouds, but apparently a curtain won't work? How does the ""machine crossbow"" supposedly work, with no chemical or explosive reaction to drive the arrows out -- since crossbow works by the pent up energy of the bending of the prods, which NEVER MOVE (must be magic, because there's no other explanation). There are a couple semi-original ideas and a lot of unfulfilled possibilities with characters -- and the fact that not a single one of these ever comes to fruition just makes it more frustrating. As my husband put it, ""too bad such great action was wrapped around such a crappy story"".",Van Helsing
955,todd-b,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,1,8 May 2004,"Listen, I like pretty much everything. I even found some things to like in Punisher. But, this movie has no redeeming value whatsoever.
The story (what there is of it)is bad. The dialog is atrocious. The ""acting"" is directly from the Shatner school. The special effects are used too frequently and for no reason. The music in no way fit the action. All in all this is literally one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
The basic flaw with the whole thing is the fact that the movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. First it was a comedy, then a special effects extravaganza, then an action movie, then a horror movie and finally a love story. Only problem is, it really is none of them. I found it very hard to care about anything that was happening on the screen. I almost fell asleep several times.On the plus side, the main characters are all very pretty and the music is very loud.This could have been a very cool movie if it would have just picked a genre and stuck with it.2 out of 10",Van Helsing
956,mikemaddogadams,A contemporary classic?,10,8 May 2004,"What an excellent matinee movie! Aside from a bit of weak dialogue and a question I have about one of the major action sequences this James Bond/Indiana Jones meets the monsters of Universal Studios really delivered the goods for me.  Pure escapism and mind-boggling special effects from start to finish.  I felt that the film remained true to the spirit and heritage of the great classic Universal flicks with a clever nod to the Hammer Studio vampire films of the 60's. Van Helsing is not a horror movie so much as it is a monster/action movie. I particularly enjoyed the portrayal of the Frankenstein monster character.  I also felt that the sensuality of vampirism was deftly handled considering the makers were going for a PG rating. I can't decide whether two of the very final scenes were an homage or just plain pop-corny but given the spirit of the film I guess they worked. Van Helsing far surpassed my expectations so much so that I plan to go back to the theatre and see it again...something I haven't done in a very, very long time. Try to catch the DLP version it is visually stunning. I hope for a sequel!",Van Helsing
957,alandamp,Another CG film with no substance,3,8 May 2004,"I knew what to expect going into this film and I could still barely stand to watch it.  They should have spent some of the CG budget on a decent script.  The lack of any intelligent dialog or character development leads me to wonder if the producers of this film think that special effects are all that is needed to make a film these days.  Someone needs to put a stop to these mindless comic book/superhero movies.  I don't ask a lot from movies, just that they are somewhat entertaining or have some sort of emotional impact so that I can become interested in the characters.  This film offers neither.  The CG graphics/stunts are so unrealistic that no one could possible be scared of any of the bad guys (including Hugh and Kate in the movie).  In fact the good guys seem to be as strong as the bad guys in this movie, taking as much if not more physical abuse and coming out of it with barely a scratch.  The only dialog in the movie is a few one liners to try and make the audience laugh (is this supposed to be horror or comedy?). I could sit and pick this movie apart all day, but I won't waste your time and neither should you.  My advice is stop giving these CG movies the benefit of the doubt by watching them like I've been doing.  Maybe if we all stop going to see them, the studios will start making some improvements!!",Van Helsing
958,FremontTroll,Leave the Swinging to Spidey (spoiler),4,25 May 2004,"This film had the old action/adventure matinee feeling to it. I would have liked it more if it were more about fantasy/horror and less of a Hollywood-like formula. Even if I were a kid.In my mind the themes I found interesting had to do with evil forces within beauty, revealed in very frightening and sometimes uncontrollable ways. Some characters show a bit of the conflict within - vampiress controlling a cat-like nature to pounce, with jaws distorting to an elongated state. (This chilling effect reinforces how cats really are more frightening at closer inspection of their long fangs!) Also, the werewolf was not able to contain his animalistic changing nature - even among friends! Frankinstein's monster also touched on the polar opposite - the hideous creature is beautiful inside. Although done before, those timeless ideas offered the best scenes of the movie, frightening and sad. I thought that the credits at the end were creative and artistic.The worst parts include clothing for Van which seemed like it was taken from the Indiana Jones set (as well as the character), a gadget prop scene ala James Bond ""What can this do, Q.?"", and for Anna that typical vampire-fu, back-flipping Buffy the Slayer action!I would have liked it more if the movie had battled in the mind, not so much visually, and left the viewers figuring out how things connected for themselves. Sadly, for me there were just too many ropes setup in the right place at the right time. Leave the swinging to Spidey.",Van Helsing
959,jackie-121,Fantastic!,10,8 May 2004,"Van Helsing is everything that I hoped it would be. Awesome visual effects and tongue and cheek humor (much like The Mummy movies).

A wonderful scene in nothing but some shredded underclothes (no shirt; no pants)!!! WHAT A PHYSICAL SPECIMAN HE IS!!! There are no sexual scenes (some sensual behavior from the vampire brides - some innuendos otherwise) - no filthy language and no real gory parts - excellent movie.

For those who said it sucked... obviously you are not into this type of movie, so please.. don't bother seeing this genre of movie.  THE MOVIE WAS REALLY GOOD!!  The cow was quite humorous, definitely unexpected.  I did not expect the heroine to die at the end of the movie, but it still ended well.  I thought that Hyde/Jekyll resembled the same one from League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, but if you ever read the book, they both went by the description in the book, which I thought was good.

963,johnsboy,Switch off the movie snob within and enjoy,8,9 May 2004,"Having read so many negative views it was with some trepidation that I took my nephew along to see the movie. I was however, pleasantly surprised to be thoroughly entertained.  I don't know what some folks were expecting with this film, but I was only looking to be entertained, and entertained I certainly was.  This is escapist stuff not an art house movie.  Sure some of the dialogue could be better and a bit more could be done on character development.  The CGI could also have been improved, Mr Hyde anyone? But overall its fabulous fun. The action is pretty much non-stop and the film is visually stunning for the most part. Okay so there's no deep meaningful plot. So what? Can anyone tell me what the great plot was in ""Lost in Translation""?  I still enjoyed that film too, but it never got slaughtered like Van Helsing. If you're looking for some arty movie with depth and substance, save your money.  However, if you're simply looking to be entertained, go see the movie, switch off the movie snob within, sit back and enjoy.",Van Helsing
964,pegasus088,Excellent!!!,10,9 May 2004,"Wow, let me tell you, Van Helsing has got to be the most action-packed thrill ride I have ever seen! I absolutely loved Steven Sommer's The Mummy and the Mummy Returns, because the action, plot, and even hints of comedy made the movie extremely fun. Actually, I was skeptical about Van Helsing when I first saw the preview. It looked like another monster movie that jams too much into it, with nothing exciting and fresh about it. I was doubtful that one movie could have all these famous monsters, and have them make a classic movie. I was wrong! This movie was awesome! Combined with the best special effects I have seen since LOTR, a cool and interesting plot line, and even cooler characters, Van Helsing is a must-see movie this May. I especially liked Anna Valerious, and her ""I dont need any help"" attitude. Trying to grab and throw any weapon available at her nemesis, Dracula, was something that made me laugh. It reminds me of The Mummy Returns when Evie is trying to drag a bench in front of the museum doors to block the dead warriors from getting to them, and Rick says ""Honey, what are you doing? These guys don't use doors!"" And the warriors bust out of the walls, frightening them both.

That is just so hilarius. I saw twice already even though it is now Sunday and it came out on Friday I saw it Saturday and today afternoon.It is so good.My friend Annie who I saw it with twice she kept saying Sexy Body to Hugh Jackman(Whispering it though).So if you haven't seen Van Helsing see it it is way good.Two thumbs up Hugh.",Van Helsing
966,scottmire,Let's Keep Things In Perspective...,7,9 May 2004,"First off, let me say that I am a HUGE fan of the early Universal horror movies. These movies created the genre. My understanding was that Van Helsing was a modern, CGI-heavy homage to those early movies. The movie even begins where the Son Of Frankenstein left off. Except for the stellar perfomance of Karloff in The Mummy and the first 2 Frankenstein movies, almost all of the rest of the early Universal Dracula/Frankenstein/Wolfman movies were fun (and sometimes silly) popcorn movies. True, there was not a lot of room in this movie for deep acting and the story might even be considered campy, but that's ok. It was a fun addition to the Universal horror tradition.  I liked Jackman's Van Helsing character and David Wenham was great. There were a few questionable bits of dialog, a bad accent here and there, some borderline CG, etc, etc...but I enjoyed the movie a great deal.",Van Helsing
967,tang167,Hugh Jackman is totally hot!!!,8,9 May 2004,"Basically this film is pretty much like The Mummy. Some plots don't make too much sense, pure entertainment.They try to make this another Indiana Jones movie. You can see something in it. Hugh definitely has the charm to put the role out. However, the story is a little bit weak. I'm also a big fan of Indy, if they are going to find someone to play Indy in the future, I would love to see Hugh as Indy.He could be funny, tough, and charming, very talented actor.",Van Helsing

Honestly, i went in with such high hopes... my girlfriend for a week went around work saying ""your reputation precedes you"". Because it was funny. But in all honesty there's no better example of the concept of ""Overdoing it"" than VH. Overacted. Overactioned. Over-clichéd... one after another after another. Too many plot-saving miracles - catching a tossed antidote while swinging wildly from a distant tower during a severe lightning storm just one example. I really liked frankenstien - he was a really likeable character, a nice guy, brave, and interestingly mechanical. And i think ""some things are better left forgot"" is the worst cinematic cop-out in history.

I think that a lot of people were expecting TOO much from it, and they read too much into it.  This is one of those movies that you just go see to enjoy.  You go to relax, not think.  It is very enjoyable, and its NON-STOP action.  you are SERIOUSLY on the edge of your seat for the entire duration of the movie.  It REALLY doesn't seem like a 2 1/2 hour movie.  It can be predictable in some parts, but the graphics and animation are EXCELLENT. They really did a GREAT job!  There are a few different places that will surprise you.  Don't listen to the REVIEWS, go see it and DECIDE for yourself.  It is an AWESOME way to kick off the summer movie season!

This was no masterpiece, but it was just as fun for me as Sommers' first Mummy movie was. I didn't mind that the special effects weren't seamless. The sometimes cheesy effects, acting, and plot just added to the overall experience. The only thing that would have made this a better movie for me is if Jack Burton was the main character and this was a sequal to Big Trouble in Little China. The Frankenstein monster sold it for me with his perfect blend of intelligence, compassion, and humanity. His soulful character almost made this the perfect movie.Oh, and Kate Beckinsale in tight leather pants doesn't hurt, in any case.",Van Helsing

Are all phrases I would use to describe this way too expensive movie, that had some promise. I will give the director this: the visuals in this movie are amazing. I will admit that the music was solid. But when action scenes, become layered on top of action scenes, which become layered on top of two or three more actions scenes, all at the same time, there is too much going on (Learn from Spielberg in Indiana Jones and learn that much of a good thing is good, but also learn from Godzilla that too much of a bad thing is bad!). Not enough in this movie to make me want to care. If you are going to focus on several characters, make me care. Yes the person I was with jumped a few times, and at times there were very creative thoughts mixed in with a whole lot of crap. The whole baby spawn of dracula was such a bad idea. Van Helsing is a regal character deserving of a regal movie. This is just the REGAL BEAGLE with special effects and Larry is still a poor man's Jack Tripper...;)",Van Helsing

However, it does not deserve the flames it has been getting. First off the choice to use black and white for the first few minuets is strongly trying to tell the viewer that you are going back to a time in Hollywood's history were what we have come to expect will not apply here. Any one who has viewed the interviews of Summers will know the he was a huge fan of the old B movie horror classics that Hollywood put out so long ago. This movie is his chance to show us that vision. In addition the man can't let his humor not shine through every chance he gets. ""In the name of Allah, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!"" in the current political times that line would not be taken as humor but in the situation you help but laugh. This move is not meant to be a land mark in Hollywood history nor is it meant to be even a best picture attempt. This movie asks you to suspend what beliefs and bias you may have and to simply sit back and enjoy a visually entertaining story.Again SpoilersFor one of the previous commentators I would ask that they think about their comments. Creaturecicle can you think of any other way to transport that guy long term. The whole bride thing and girl running around outside.

The cg was bad and could have been much better. the monsters almost looked animated.I was very disapointed in the movie.

978,banzhafsb,Come on people...,10,12 May 2004,"I don't know what people have against this movie.  First off, critics always hate movies that turn out to be good or enjoyable, it's just a fact.  So I never listen to movie critics, I only go off of what my friends tell me about stuff.  But I seriously loved this movie.  Same thing happened with The Punisher, terrible reviews but I thought it was awesome.  Anyways, I'm not going to summarize the entire movie, just some characters.  Hugh Jackman (whom I love as an actor) as Van Helsing is awesome.  I read reviews comparing him to Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and saying that he wasn't as memorable.  That's just plain dumb, because it wasn't until after at least the 2nd Indiana Jones movie that people found Indiana Jones to be a one of a kind character.  Anyways, I thought he did a great job, and he brought a lot of fun and excitement to the screen.  David Wenham as Carl was great, he was awesome as Faramir in the Lord of the Rings, and he was great in Van Helsing.  He provides some comic relief as Carl, and I loved it.  Now for my favorite part: Kate Beckinsale.  Ok, to begin with Kate Beckinsale is pretty easily one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen between those I've met/seen in real life and in movies and television.  But in this movie in particular, everything about her makes me drool.  The outfit, the hair, the make up, and especially the accent, all just, wow.  I seriously cannot stop thinking of it.  But anyways, even though she'll likely receive little to no credit for her role as Anna Valerious, she did an incredible job. Anyways, I've seen this twice now, and I still love it.  So for those of you who are looking to see a fun and enjoyable movie, see this one.  If you're looking for a George Lucas or Peter Jackson masterpiece, you're going to be disappointed.  But this movie serves it's purpose in my mind.",Van Helsing
979,juliejdcp,What a great film,10,13 May 2004,"I must admit I didn't know what or who Van Helsinger was about before I went to see the film. A moden twist to 3 horror villains and one of them ends up being a good guy - for a change! Extreme special effects were an added bonus to an in-depth tale and at times quite funny. Hugh Jackman was an excellent ""slayer"" with fantastic 007 style weapons. Makes you wonder if Van Helsinger also drank a dry martini - SHAKEN not stirred!!! It's been such a long time since I actually jumped in my seat at the cinema and there were a few occasions. There could be a possibility for a sequel!? Everyone has their own opinion but for me this was an excellent film definitely along the same lines as Bram Stokers Dracula/Raiders of the Lost Ark.",Van Helsing
980,jonesboro_16f,LOVED IT!,10,13 May 2004,"I loved the movie, I would go and watch it everyday if I could.  I think that this is one of the best Thriller movies of its time.  I also think it is one of the best Vampire/Slayer movies also.... LOVED IT!  I also think that if you really watched it close you would also see what it is in the movies that makes kids act like they do.  It isn't the movies, but it is close.  I believe this is a great movie, but it should only be viewed by older children and adults.  Ages 13 and up like the ratings says.  Also, if you actually watched real close you would see the special affects that made this movie great!  So from my eyes it is a Vampire vs. Slayer movie, involving Count Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing.",Van Helsing
981,kjtuthill,Worth the time,8,14 May 2004,"If you're looking for a good way to spend 2 hours, go see this movie. Sure, Frankenstein isn't how you remember him from other movies, but he is how he's supposed to be in the book, more or less.  Hollywood has done a lot of damage to the Monster, and now it's time for a more accurate portrayal of Mary Shelley's creation. Hugh Jackman does a good job NOT playing Wolverine, and Kate Beckinsale does Romanian with the best of them.  This is from the guy who brought us ""The Mummy"" so expect some camp along with your action/adventure.  As someone who has read both ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein,"" I was not disappointed by the way the movie turned out.",Van Helsing
982,reinedelamonde,"Good Acting, Good Plot, Good Music (SPOILER!!!)",7,15 May 2004,"'Van Helsing' is one of the most interesting movies I've seen in a long time. I'm pretty picky in my movie viewing, so I don't go out to the theater very often. The plot lines, musical scores and delicious acting is what makes this one of my top choices of films. There are a lot of unexpected twist and turns (the Angel Gabriel turning into a werewolf?) that even made me nod my head and applaud. I think what I loved most about this film(not the graphics.... they were well, good. at best. I'm no longer impressed with Computer Generated Imagery or C.G.I. for short) is the superb acting by the cast. The first bit of credit goes to David Wenham. It took me about 10 minutes of his acting to actually realize that this was the same person that played one of my favorite characters in the Lord of The Rings. His quirky comic relief was commendable. I think my favorite actor was the one who played Dracula. He seemed to envelope the role as his own (as a good actor should).I cannot express my adoration of the musical score of this film. For me, the score of a film is an important part on how the audience reacts, whether or not they notice it. Keeping up with the action on screen, this adds a definite gothic feel to the movie. My favorite element of this score was the chanting. I will definitely have to add it to my soundtrack collection.Granted, the whole werewolf thing was a LITTLE cheesy (I can see the headlines now:""Wolverine Turns Werewolf in this Action/Adventure!"") but it can be forgiven.All in all, this was a good movie. If a good mix of thrills, laughs and a new twist on some old stories is what you're looking for, this film is definitely it.",Van Helsing
983,stodaz,Why isn't there a zero in the voting drop down box?,1,15 May 2004,"I had heard that Van Helsing had 38% on Rotten Tomatoes however I prefer to make up my own mind...so unfortunately I decided to go see the movie. Having just seen it (less than 30 minutes ago), I can tell you that I am struggling to think of a worse movie than this one.  Ok ok so maybe Blood Moon comes close (that REALLY bad Australian horror movie that sent me walking after only 30 minutes...)...  Actually the reality is I haven't seen a $150 million dollar movie made worse than this.....  This takes the cake. Bad accents, bad acting, relatively ok CGI but chronically noticeable CGI all the same...awful awful awful.  Admittedly Hugh Jackman was ok, but my god the rest of it is atrocious.  I have committed to memory the name of the writer/director aswell as Richard Roxburgh and a host of others so that whenever I see a movie featuring their names again I will NOT waste my time, energy, and hard earned money.  Beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder as is evidenced by 13% of votes here giving it 10 out of 10.  However stupidity is also in the hands of the beholder as I'm sure 10 might easily be mistaken as 1 in a drop down box....oops, my girlfriend just informed me Rotten Tomatoes has reduced the % to 25.....and falling...I don't drink alot of alcohol but right now bourbon is my only release from the grip of being Halsified....sorry if I'm offending anyone but geez, what can I do, I've just spent the last 2 hours in hell-sing.......",Van Helsing
984,klsdad,Wow!! What a thrill ride!!,9,15 May 2004,"Saw ""Helzing"" yesterday morning (11 AM).  Saw it in digital projection but was disappointed that it was not widescreen. Great projecton clarity.. and wondrous sound from the thrilling soundtrack!I think it is one of the greatest thrill rides I've ever been on. It sure beats the hell out of Space Mountain!! Caught myself saying ""WOW"" several times.. outloud!! Can't remember having that ever happen before and I'm a film buff... (Although it may have happened in ""2001 A Space Oddessy"".. at the beginning.. when the ape throws the bone in the air..and the scene changes to outer space with the Strauss waltz music and beautiful revolving spaceship.)",Van Helsing
985,mircalla25,"Why Hugh, Why?",1,15 May 2004,"Huge Hugh Jackman fan, I have to say that first.  Why did the movie have to stink?  The film was obnoxiously melodramatic (ex. Beckinsale's hair tosses and running sequences were annoying).  I sometimes found it hard to understand what Dracula was saying.  His brides were absurd; posturing, screeching and moaning excessantly.  The special effects were amazing, however dizzying.  The film did pay homage to the horror films of old: the opening scenes featuring the creation of Frankenstein's monster shot in black and white.  Although most of the film was well, ""over the top"". Hugh, however, did the best he could with what he had before him.  I would recommend the film to Hugh Jackman fans, for everyone else; wait for the DVD.",Van Helsing
986,Dragonflm61,Great Movie!!,10,18 May 2004,"I know some people believe that this movie wasn't really good, but I disagree. The movie was a great mix of action, suspense, and humor. For those that believed that some scenes were a little campy, it should be reminded that they were trying to bring back some of the old horror movie experience (as shown with the black and white scene) and not bring everything in all new. The special effects were great and the movie also brought new twists to the characters while mostly keeping their traditional roles. Also the ""friar"" brought in humor at just the right times to create a great balance of content. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes this genre. It really is lots of fun.",Van Helsing
987,thegneech,A great bad movie,9,17 May 2004,"I freely admit that Van Helsing is not as good as Pirates of the Caribbean, but I maintain that it IS good in the same WAY as Pirates of the Caribbean, which is to say that it's a fun roller-coaster of a movie with a Weird Tales twist.The best way to enjoy this movie is to pretend that it's anime rather than live action; I think the presence of live actors seems to have fooled too many people into thinking that it's a movie you're supposed to somehow take seriously. It's not. It's a movie you're supposed to grin and laugh and go ""Now THAT'S a neat image!"" at.Chew the scenery! Swing from the wires! Blast a bazillion bolts out of the gatling crossbow! And look great doing it. That's what I call a terrific summer movie. :)",Van Helsing
988,spidey_4_life,Great movie,10,17 May 2004,"I thought the movie was great,great plot, good amount of action, great acting, great characters and great Animation. My favorite characters were the 3 werewolves they were well animated. my favorite scene in the film is where Van helsing turns into a warewolf and kills Dracula. they're are many classical monsters in this film such as Dracula,Dr. jeckle(mr. hyde), werewolves, and freinkenstein. This film will make you jump out of your seat plenty of times. it really is like a roller-coaster ride. Hugh jackman, kate Beckinsale and Richard Roxburgh were great actors in this movie. I give this movie a 10 because it is a great thriller film and will be one of my favorites of all time.",Van Helsing
989,dlstockton21,This movie sucked.,3,18 May 2004,"OK, when watching this movie keep in mind that you just set there numb to the brain, have no conscience ....and you might ac utally like it. For having a budget of 160 million this movie should defiantly had been better, it introduced nothing new to the table, it was just an all out visual f/x ride. The studios should start giving a fraction of that budget to people who actually know how to make movies, instead of someone who will just recreate the same material and slap 100 million effects on it. The script for this must have been horrible, thats why it had so big of a budget , they thought they could get away with piling more money on it to solve there problems. I predict ""Van Helsing"" will not make its money back, and it doesn't deserve to, in my opinion, quite frankly. 3/10",Van Helsing
990,laudus,Vile Hurling,1,18 May 2004,"This could possibly be the third worst movie I've seen, just ahead of Tango and Cash and Nothing But Trouble. A couple of early lines make you think that it might be a send-up of the horror genre, a la Kill Bill, but that soon devolves into an orgy of CGI and poorly written dialogue. The only amusing performance in the movie is turned in by David Wenham, playing the semi-bumbling sidekick. There is nothing that this film delivers that you didn't see last summer...or the summer before that. If you really must see it, wait for pay-per-view and watch it only if there's nothing but info-mercials on every channel on the grid. The best moments of this movie were the ones I spent in the restroom.",Van Helsing
991,Immortal_Soul_Of_Eternity,I liked it! ^_^,8,20 May 2004,"Overall, I think the movie was really good. I won't say that it's the ""best"" I've ever seen, but it was good. The plot didn't suck, even though it was sorta expectable. Sure, everyone knew that Dracula was going to die, but the way they did it was very unique. No one expected, even I didn't, that Van Helsing was going to be turned into a werewolf. And I don't think that anyone expected Anna to die. Even though it sorta sucked that she died, it was a good ending. The fact that she died made the movie more realistic, because not everything has a happy ending. The graphics were awesome, especially with the werewolves. Plus, Hugh Jackman was hot. I rate it a solid 8 out of 10! Oh, and I hope they come out with a sequel. ^.^ It'd be really awesome!",Van Helsing
992,vito0986,its better than 5.2,7,25 May 2004,"I think if you like all out action and not a real deep storyline Van Helsing delivers with flying colors! It deserves better than a5.2 rating, guess not enough people have gone to watch it yet. It probably has 2004's best mind-blowing special-effects and whether he's hacking some system (Swordfish) or slicing and dicing(X2), Hugh Jackman is the epitome of cool in a movie.Yeah the movie is one explosion after the other but at least it is not just senseless violence, I've heard good comments from both 54 year old women and 13 year old kids. That's both ends of the spectrum which says something .In conclusion Van Helsing deserves a little more credit than it's been getting after how many other movies have the hero fighting a giant dog!",Van Helsing
993,mm006d9330,Hmmmmm,4,2 June 2004,"Went to see this film last weekend after being disappointed that we couldn't get tickets to go see 'The Day After Tomorrow' because it had sold out! So instead of going home, we decided to see 'Van Helsing'. Hmmmm.......what can I say? Interesting concept, very good effects and make up and of course costume but on the whole, it was a cross between 1950s 'b' movies and comic strip stories. The director had thrown out the rule book on the origins of Dracula, Frankenstein, etc and has put them all into one film. Was entertaining but won't be buying it on DVD when it is inevitably released in the UK. The best thing I can say about it is the vampires where kick-ass!!",Van Helsing
994,mrandmrscrider,this was a great movie.,8,28 May 2004,"Van Helsing was excellent! The action was wonderful, everything looked sooo real!If you like alittle scary movie combined with alittle mystery, this is the movie... it has it all!!! And, if you like alittle love story in things, it has it too!!!***** Movie. you could have been more storyline to it and more character details .when you start it was n't know where the movie was being and van was hunting down nedd more depth to it!need to hunt more monster down in it before the end was to be more detail to it, talk vampires we need know they were doing and hoe they got to there hideout without mess up the ending too muchover all it was great movie but for the money we paid to see it ~!",Van Helsing
995,Gd00,"Nice one, with some flaws.",6,29 May 2004,"Yeah, Van Helsing is a nice film. But too many ""poetic licences"". There are a lot of ropes, there just to help one character to jump and then finish right at the exact time and place where he/her is supposed to be ? OK, I might live with that, only if it was all. Another thing, in the middle of the Carpathians, in a lost village full of ugly farmers ready to suspect anyone lives Anna Valerious, this woman that appears with such a beauty has sprung from those people? I hardly believe that. But after all, Jackman was perfect and Roxburgh too, the costumes where wonderful and even the settings. Nice way to spend an evening, if you don't have anything better to watch.",Van Helsing
996,riothejedi,Richard Roxburgh stole the show...,9,29 May 2004,"We are, of course, supposed to be rooting for Van Helsing when watching this film, but what with the regular cheesy and clichéd dialogue of the heroes and the incredibly effective vampire charm of Richard Roxburgh's, I switched sides pretty much as soon as I saw him.Roxburgh is undoubtedly the best Dracula ever! He really has that charm over women that Dracula was reputed to have and he looked great. Although Hugh Jackman did have some cool little scenes, they all look pretty rubbish next to Draculas...Definitely a must see for all Roxburgh fans.Either way, it's still an entertaining film and if you're not expecting too much script and story wise, you'll have a blast watching it!Can't wait for the DVD!",Van Helsing
997,masterblaster882001,I've got a bad feeling about this...,2,29 May 2004,"(WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD)OK, before I even start this, lets just say my expectations were extremely low. The previews for Van Helsing gave me flash-backs to League of Exdrodinary Gentlemen, which isn't a good thing. The flick started off alright, with a nice fight between Helsing and Dr. Jeckyl (Mr. Hyde?). However, thats where the fun pretty much ends. As a movie goes on, one expects the characters to be developed and given, well, character. All we know about Helsing is that he was found by the Vatican, and he hunts monsters for some secret government agency. When the protagonist has a mysterious past, its expected that in the movie, he's going to find out his past history. This, of course, never happens. At any time does the movie even try to tell the audience where this man came from.Anyway, our protagonist goes on a journey to, wait for it, Transylvania where he, wait for it again, battles Dracula! Now this isn't your normal, everyday Dracula, who is slick, sly and seductive. This is a bad thing. Just when I thought the writer (Steven Summers) couldn't make a character less dimensional then Helsing, he tosses in Dracula. For some reason Dracula needs both Frankenstein's monster and a werewolf to raise his army of vampire offspring. Dracula, who is thousands of years old, calls Helsing by the name Gabriel. Apparently, he and Helsing have been battling for centuries, but neither Helsing nor the audience is ever fully clued in to this fact. Dracula only gets lamer when his weakness is revealed. For a reason unknown, Dracula is immune to the usual vampire slaying repitoir of sun light, garlic, and stakes to the heart. His only weakness is, werewolves. Wait, dosn't Dracula employ werewolves? Yes, he employs them for his personal protection, which is totally ludacris. Would Superman wear kryptonite underwear because of the added support? I think not. Oh yeah, Dracula is also a married man, three times over, who knew.If I had a dollar for evertime I saw a twenty minute long ""fight scene"" between the brides of Dracula, or a werewolf, or any monster and Helsing, I could have paid for the movie, thrice. This presents another problem. Van Helsing is an action movie by nature, and one would assume that the movie sensibly sacrifices plot for explosions, death, and snappy one-liners, however it fails miserably at presenting any good action qualities. It regurgitates the same fights, by moving the location and number of people in the fight. The first fight will be on par with other recent action movies, the others will bore you to tears. The character development problem plagues this movie to every extent. Frankenstein's Monster, a John Goodman-esque meat-head, is either a super intelligent genius or a complete blithering idiot. Somewhere Mary Shelly is spinning in her grave at 100mph. Helsing discovers this poor sack in a cave, which Helsing conveniently fell into, and immediately falls in love with it. Even after Frankenstein insist that Helsing kill him because he is the key to Dracula's evil plan, Helsing insist that he won't, and that he must protect Fathead, and thus drag the dying horse of a movie on for another hour. Lastly, the movie takes itself way too seriously, for a flick that should've been a mindless monster bashing. Steven Summers, seems to think that when people go to action movies such as Van Helsing they are expecting to see a moving story with intense. This, of course, isn't true. Action movies should contain minimal plot, but still contain enough smooth and witty dialogue so the audience doesn't fall asleep from repeditive fight scenes made up of characters who the audience could care less died. When making an action movie, a writer/director must follow three simple rules: 1) The enemy must be something hated by all: I suggest Natzi's, Commies, Terrorists, Robots from the future, Aliens, all of which will be hated by all red-blooded Americans, forever. 2) Special Effects alone don't make an action movie: Hooray! Explosions and Monsters that look soooooo real. Special effects work only when applied sensibly, or with good use (see Jurassic Park or Lord of the Rings). They are not made to replace dialouge or character development. 3) The audience MUST be able to connect with the protagonist: Whether its a vampire hunter or a NY police officer, the audience must be able to see life in the leading role. A lame character has no pull on the audience when the movie puts said character into danger.Van Helsing failed on mostly every level. I'll give it points for nice visuals, but after two and a half hours, they get old. This is one of the first movies I've been too where I've seen people leave then movie before its been finished and show looks of disgust after the movie finished (and I saw 8 legged freaks). If your not wanting to pay 7+ bucks to see the poster for Spiderman 2 and the trailer for The Village, go to the library and read Bram Stroker's Dracula and Merry Shelly's Frankenstein, or if your not into the reading thing just rent some old monster movies. Trust me on this one.Rating: * (1 out of 5 stars)",Van Helsing
998,bloodroses_thorn,Not as bad as everyone said.,10,29 May 2004,"I know Van Helsing got a lot of bad reviews, but I really enjoyed it. It was two and a half hours long, but didn't feel like it. They managed to combine many different horror stories, and yet make them all work. It was sort of like an Abbot and Costello flick, but it still pulled it off. The graphics were very nice as well, but the thing I enjoyed the most was that the werewolves actually looked like wolves! They weren't giant gorillas like they are in most horror movies, they were giant wolves.I wouldn't say this was an amazing movie, but it was definitely a fun movie, and well worth the 8 bucks to get in.",Van Helsing
999,michelleduggins2001,Whirlwind Ride,10,30 May 2004,"Wow, I thought this was a wonderful film. Dracula (Richard Roxburgh) is superbly menacing, Frankenstein's monster is very well played - the make-up and acting are superb and Hugh Jackman is spot on as the monster killer. A nice mix of humour, plot and action. The sets are breathtaking, the attention to detail is superb, the film has a very Gothic feel about it and the action is more or less non-stop. The werewolves are very realistic, the change from man to wolf is harrowing and fascinating to watch, similarly the change of the vampires to their flying 'bat' forms are smooth and believable. Dracula's brides in particular are brilliantly scary. There are some gaffes, e.g characters showing knowledge of things that happened when they weren't in the scene but they detracts nothing from the film. I enjoyed this film so much, I went to the cinema twice to see it. Here's hoping there is a sequel.",Van Helsing

Sommers blows you away with the special effects. The creature look as they are supposed to look. The talent that was put into this movie was incredible. The beautiful Kate Beckinsale(underworld, Pearl Harbor) was great. Hugh Jackman does a perfect job portraying this mysterious evil hunter. This is a movie that defines what a summer movies should be. That is should be great and enticing. This movie will put a standard for summer movies. There are not enough movies like this.

1001,neko77doitsu,Where has all the logic gone ?,2,31 May 2004,"Well, there has not been a movie like this for some time. Ads for it everywhere, no matter if subway, television or print media. I admit Mr. Wolverine did his job very well, but even a good actor cant save the movie if the script is that bad. It looks as if they took the plot of 200 B-movies, put it together - no matter if there are huge logical holes in this storyline. Okay, the sexy Underground-Lady is fighting against Werewolves, Vampires, even against Mr. Longteeth himself (should this be the prototype of a gay vampire king?) and doesn't even get scratched. But in the end, she gets killed (!) or rather crushed by Helsing. Helloooo??? Please, do me one favour and don't do a 2nd part of this nightmare.",Van Helsing
1002,sandmanrogue,"""It had great special effects""",4,3 June 2004,"""It had great special effects."" That's about all i heard from any source before going to see this movie. Unfortunately, to a movie, that little five-letter phrase is like what ""Can't we just be friends?"" is to a relationship: A hint that nothing good is about to happen.So i went to see it anyway? Of course i did. This movie HAD to be good. I'd been waiting for it to come out for nearly a year. Everything about the concept interested me. A sort of Vampire$ meets Blade. I was even thinking about how pitifully the upcoming Blade 3 would pale in comparison to Van Helsing. I haven't been that naive since the 3rd time i said ""I do.""You probably want me to elaborate on what was so bad about it. I wish i could nail it down to any one thing. But i can't quite put my finger on it.I'll start with the convoluted plot. James Bond, er, i mean Van Helsing, an agent of MI-6, er, i mean a secret religious security/intelligence agency under the auspices of the churches of multiple religious faiths, is sent (accompanied by Q, er, i mean Carl, the weapons/gadgets expert from MI-6, er, I mean...oh forget it!) to find/aid the last remaining descendants of a family that has been battling Count Dracula for several centuries. Why the sudden urgency? Because the family pledged long ago never to set foot in heaven until the Count has been defeated. Should the last of the family fall, their souls and those of all their ancestors will be forever in limbo between heaven and purgatory. There's an equally convoluted sub-plot/co-plot involving the Dracula family that i won't bother going into as there's no easy way to do it without going spoilers.The actors/actresses all seemed about as interested in being in this movie as i felt in watching it. Jackman, Beckinsale and Roxburgh, all of whom I've loved in multiple other roles, gave performances worthy of only the most mediocre of after-school-specials. Granted, the movie was so fast-paced that there wasn't much room for petty little things like feeling, or character development, i still couldn't help but imagine as i sat there, how much better the movie might have been if it had been performed as a school play by one of my 2nd wife's kindergarten classesI hope the writers/producers of this masterpiece are already in a back room somewhere shredding documents and deleting e-mails, because just like in the Enron incident, they've got some 'splaining to do. They're going to have to explain to someone eventually why this movie was made in the first place, much less released in theaters.",Van Helsing
1003,rhythmladynw,A fun movie...who cares what the critics think!,10,5 June 2004,"This movie is a fun movie to watch, and being that I am a graphic artist and very familiar with CGI, I would say it is also an amazing film with aspects that have not been used in any other action films.The point of a movie is not to pick it apart and be hyper critical, it's to have fun with it, enjoy it, and respect it. Not all movies suit all tastes, but for those who enjoy the Gothic genre, this movie is quite pleasing, and to some I have talked to, very exciting! I personally felt it was brilliant in many ways, and yes, I do feel it may have been a little too fast paced at times, it was still a great story and a very enjoyable film.Critical nitpicking be damned! If it makes you jump at the scary parts, laugh at the funny parts, and cry at the sad parts, then it's everything it was supposed to be and worth dropping the cash to see or purchase when it eventually comes out on DVD!",Van Helsing
1004,mrjones789,Could be better,6,6 June 2004,"After leaving the cinema, i couldn't help but to have un answered questions in my head about this film. OK the story line wasn't great, or was it because i was trying to compare it to ""the league of extraordinary gentlemen"" which is why i didn't enjoy it as much as i would of liked to. to be fair to hugh jackman i thought he played his part very well, as he has done in x-men 1 & 2 and i thought he was brilliant in swordfish. I must comment on the special effects as with most films now a days they were second to none i really like the scene in notre damm where our hero dr. van helsing is in chase of mr hyde where they finally come face to face with each other before a fight breaks out, the effects of that are fantastic but overall its the story that counts and I'm afraid to say in my view, the story line did let it down, it could have been a much better film.",Van Helsing
1005,TestudoAubreii,Don't be deterred by bad reviews,9,8 June 2004,"This is the best film I've seen lately- not because of any dramatic impact that it carries, but simply because it is a fun, well-designed, monster flick. Understand that you can't go into a movie featuring Frankenstein's Monster and expect Shakespeare. The plot is admittedly thin, and the Universal Monsters have been around for so long that they've become somewhat unimpressive, but the director has done a very good job of minimizing these factors to create a visually and emotionally appealing film. The sets and characters are beautifully designed; there are no real instances of bad acting; the action is fast-paced and not too predictable; and the whole thing combines to create one really great adventure film, if you only give it a chance. I'm glad that I did. A must-see for vampire-lovers, and for those who liked The Mummy and Pirates of the Caribbean.",Van Helsing

The actor who played Dracula, was one of the worst actors i've seen in a long time. But it wasn't' all his fault, part of it was the script. I can't believe I wasted over 2 hours of my life there.

1007,cloudcastle,Great show. Not a Movie Experience.,6,13 June 2004,"I fell in love with the premise of this movie. For all you fantasy fans out there, it was taking an old cleric/scholar and turning him into a kick-butt paladin/assassin. The more I read the promos, the more I loved the idea.Then I saw the movie.I still appreciated the premise. The scripting was pretty good, minus two or three scenes. Great action movie. The overall movie experience was lacking.Its special effects were its great strength and weakness. They spent so much money and time on getting the effects right, they seemed to skimp on the little things: choreography, accent coaches, wardrobe, music, lighting, set design. These are the things that make the movie an experience rather than just a show.VAN HELSING & ANNA (Lead characters) The two main characters were very well done. I can't really complain much about them. They were well written, well acted, well directed, well wardrobed. . . I do wish they had given some character development as to why Anna was able to fight so well. But it was a long enough movie as it was, maybe they cut it out for time.Dracula Richard Roxburgh did an excellent job in his execution of his script. But he could have made his speech about having no heart a little more than one-dimensional. Let's face it, in a movie like this, we appreciate a villain that has SOME redeeming quality. His interchange with Van Helsing was much more impressive. And he handled his death rather well. Excellent method of showing a vampire's healing abilities.THE VAMPIRESSES (Dracula's brides) The vampiresses should have just been extras. Their action sequences were great. But every time they opened their mouths, I rolled my eyes and was just waiting for the next scene. They didn't really add anything to the plot or the movie except for their fights. I didn't even think they were sexy. Especially not in those campy outfits they had on. They looked like they were trying out for some psychic hotline ad.CARL (""I'm not a monk. I'm just a friar"") This was a work of genius as far as character creation goes. They give you a great taste of what it would be like if James Bond had Q with him on his assignments as a sidekick. Although I feel it was a simple part for an actor, I have to give David Wendham credit for performing it well.IGOR His line,""It's what I do"" pretty much sums it up. You can't have a movie like this without Igor. And he was doing exactly what we expected him to do. But someone was going to ask ""why is he doing that?"" So, they had Dracula ask for us. It's just what he does. Don't question it.SET DESIGN Most of the scenes were very good. But I'd think the most important set would be inside Dracula's castle. And that is where the set designer really disappointed me. Maybe it was partially the lighting and camera work. Maybe other little factors. But the cobwebs were overdone and the entire set looked too plastic. The colors were just slightly off to make it look like it was faked. Again, if I'm there to just see an action movie, OK. But the promos made it seem like it was going to be a little deeper than that.WARDROBE Van Helsing was well outfitted. As was Dracula. I could even say that the friar was done OK, but how can you go wrong with a plain brown robe? Everyone else looked really campy. Anna's wardrobe: designed well, poorly excecuted. It needed slightly different fabrics or colors that would project differently on the big screen.SPECIAL EFFECTS The battle scenes with the vampiresses and even the baby vampires were good.I never felt like I was suspending any disbelief. I just looked and felt I'd been transported. The transformation sequences were good for both Dracula and the werewolves. But when they had their final battle, they fell victim to the same problem that all heavily CG characters have. The speed and balance of the characters is always slightly off from reality. The only way I could console myself was that these were superhuman creatures able to violate some laws of physics in a fantasy movie. Even then, it was an effort to suspend my disbelief. Van Helsing's weapons were very well designed. Obviously not realistic for the era. But it was not too big a stretch for this genre of movie.EXPERIENCE This is a quality of movies that I don't see much comment on. It takes into account things like flow of the movie, emotions not only portrayed by the actors, but absorbed by the audience, the feeling that you are actually in the scene.For this quality, I'll have to give an 8 for a few scenes, but a 2 or 3 for the rest of the movie.SUMMARY If you're looking for an action movie that has someone being the superhero and kicking butt (Swarzennegger's --Commando) it's a great movie. They made some effort at being an intelligent movie as well, but only had limited success at executing that goal.If you want a movie that made you feel like you want to hear more about these characters and this world you've just been introduced to (Lord of the Rings), this was OK, but not a great movie.Cloud Castle",Van Helsing

It constitutes one of only three films I've ever actually wanted to walk out of despite having paid theater rates (I've only ever walked out of one). _Van_Helsing_ possesses no plot or character development other than tired and overly used clichés. The only redeeming and creative effort I can discern occurs in the presentation of the end credits.

Hugh Jackman was wonderful, believable and ruggedly handsome as the famous monster hunter and David Wenham was hilarious as a naughty but brilliant inventor-friar. The special effects were amazing. I enjoyed the Gothic settings as well, with the huge sets, cliffs, great halls, old castles, and grand cathedrals. It was a fun and exhilarating action-horror movie. The movie had great action adventure sequences and Gothic good vs. evil and maybe the critics ought to lighten up and realize that producers of action adventure and horror movies aren't all trying to bombard us with 100% emotionally wrenching movies like ""Terms of Endearment"".",Van Helsing
1010,uncle_sean,Auch.,3,3 July 2004,"This isn't a review as much as it is a part of a self-therapeutic process to get over a stinking experience.Before I begin, I'd like to tell you about something that characterises this inflated project where far too much money have been involved. I noticed some advertisement for a writing competition connected to this film. It stated that you should submit a story containing certain words and among them was (I kid you not) ""Van Helsing the computer game"". After reading that, it was only by chance I came to see this film, as I walked by a free showing out in the open, no charge. There is a certain type of film where you get the feeling that they cut down on working on the manuscript in order to beef up the special effects department. It usually has 'big' names fronting it, like Chuck Norris or Van Damme. Plot weaknesses are abundant and there is a clear tendency where every car crash ends with an explosion. For a film on the supernatural set before the invention of the automobile, this sure do come close to that description. Lousy acting, a story so illogical it hurts even if you've switched your brain to ""sit back and enjoy the ride"" and a 'car chase' that ends with an explosion.Some dosage of this might be forgivable if it is a shoe-string budget film made by a rookie and three of his or hers friends. This, in lack of better words, 'entity' contains digital artwork by WETA (Lord of the Rings), fabulous locations(among others a cathedral), made by an experienced director alongside actors that have been seen in cinemas before and costumes that Anne Rice would dream of putting on her characters. The sad thing is, it all feels wasted. A film that so much relies on special effects, doesn't even put them to good use.Now I didn't expect high-quality acting or a great artwork made a by a great director. After all, Stephen Sommers did The Mummy Returns. I do expect to at some degree to find enjoyment. Seeing horrible versions of classic characters being torn to pieces (did they say ""Here's an idea: Let's combine Frankenstein's monster with Tarzan!"" in the planning stage?) on expensive sets in hopeless settings doesn't include in this. I had no expectations of excellence, but any hopes of mere mediocrity was blown away. Highlander and Universal Soldier are great series going strong in comparison. Considering that the original Dracula manages to be creepy by the mere use of shadows and make-up at a time when the director's title was 'herr doktor', then Van Helsing is an artistic failure.I should say that I didn't watch the entire film. It being an outdoor showing on a plaza, I took time to go and buy myself a hot dog and some soda. I also arrived after it had begun, somewhere before Jack Hughman meets Kate Beckinsale. Even for a free show, this felt disturbingly incompetent. This is from the guy who quite liked Underworld in some of it's moments; save yourself the trouble and do NOT watch this film. Valid alternatives include renting Highlander, taking a look at episodes of Narnia or go down to your video store, close your eyes and point at random. Both Willow and Ronja Røverdatter knocks Van Helsing down into his socks and those were made before CGI with main characters under 5 foots.",Van Helsing

Oh my! yes predictable lame summer blockbuster dialog didn't escape this 2004 blockbuster. Let me not be so harsh, there is some positive, Val helsing is a great looking DVD, perhaps one of the top five looking DVDs you will ever see. Got one of those LCD, HDTV TVs well this is a show piece of how good a modern movie can look on your new screen. As a movie Van helsing assumes you have seen movies about Dracula, Frankinstein, and Ware wolves, you won't learn anything new or to better put it there is nothing new. Van Helsing looks and feel like a video game, actors are set against the back drop of some beautiful computer graphics. One more positive production design is top notch. The lead characters Val helsing played by Huge Jackman and his co-op partner/player/actress Kate Beckinsale (see her in underworld recommended), they shoot, fight CGI monsters for over two hours, surrounded by a fairly decent musical score...more noise and CGI video game looking villains characters pop out of nowhere to keep our hero busy.Jackman and Beckinsale play along, reciting dialog every so often while dogging/shooting flying things like in a video game, they solve puzzles like in a video game.

1015,neilohki,Van Helsing a song of sixpence..,1,15 October 2004,"I'm not sure why this film was made. In retrospect, I'm not sure why any movie gets made, but I'm particularly confused about this one. The cast was adequate, but this movie seems confused about whether it's a comedy, an action movie, or a horror movie. And this is the biggest problem with Van Helsing. If it could've chosen a genre to fall into, it might have worked. But it insists on being everything, and as a result, falls far short in it's attempt. The effects in Van Helsing(particularly the creature ones) are relatively well blended, but... well... not terribly impressive. With one exception(and I won't spoil which one... it's pretty obvious). The dialogue, while trying to be impressive and dramatic, is occasionally painful and forced. As a fan of many of the myths presented in Van Helsing, I found their treatment to be inadequate and disappointing.Overall, I wasn't terribly disappointed. I'd already heard that the movie wasn't all that impressive, so I didn't have any expectations. If you're not a fan of the mythic or Gothic genres however, and you like lots of bright flashes on your TV, check this movie out. You'll probably like it. I sure didn't.",Van Helsing

Vampires + Werewolves + Frankenstein + Dr Jekyll + James bond like stuff = One of the worst scenarios ever. Acting : Average at best. The characters : They're all so archetypal that I almost feel sorry for the guys who made that movie. The amnesiac anti hero, the adventurous hot chick, the evil vampire, the good doctor blinded by his ambition, ... They're all here. Dialogues : One cheesy line after another.

If you expect a serious horror movie, don't watch this. This movie isn't really scary. Sadly, the actors are nothing special in this movie. Richard Roxburgh as Dracula just isn't scary, too bad. Kate Beckinsale as Anna Valerious is boring too. The best characters are Dracula's Brides. I like the way the fly and get transformed.

In my honest opinion, I believe that this movie has the best looking werewolves I have ever seen. They are very close to how I envision them. It just goes to show that CGI is the way to go. I just wish for one thing to make the werewolf 100% complete. NEXT TIME PLEASE GIVE THE WEREWOLF A FRIGGIN TAIL! It makes no sense why the werewolf does not have a tail. Besides, aren't tails supposed to help maintain balance when they decide to run on all fours? Besides, the werewolves ""DID"" have digitigrades legs for a reason you know!Oh BTW. For all of you CGI haters. I am sorry, but I am going to have to go pro CGI with this movie, for it is top-notch work. Can you imagine keeping the movie at the pace it was set at without the use of CGI?..... No. I didn't think so. I also heard that some of you hated the transformation sequences between the vampire and the werewolf. Well just what in the hell were you looking for exactly? Something where each character takes five minutes to slowly transform from human into beast? Sorry, that doesn't work well in a fast paced action movie like this, because it doesn't keep up with the fast pace of the movie.

1035,red_bird_90,The Greatest Movie With All Classic Monsters!!,10,29 January 2005,"This movie ( Van Helsing ) i thought was great! I loved how it had all of the old movie monsters connected together somehow. The story line was good too. Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale do a great job as well as Richard Roxbourgh ( Dracula ). I would definitely tell someone to watch this. The vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein,and Dr. Jekyll are all great characters in the story. I love how they even have the ""Holy Order"" that Van Helsing is supposed to follow orders from but sometimes doesn't and gets yelled at. All my friends have watched this movie and loved it. IT is so cool!! All i can say is go out and buy it or rent it right now!!!!!! I know you will love it! I did!",Van Helsing
1036,ent0r,don't waste ur time or money on this movie,1,27 April 2005,"Well here we go first of the storyline hellsing and drac have a common past. so what? it didn't furthered the story one bit, and left us anxious and later irritated what that revelation was about. The drac wanted to kill a werewolf by giving him a antidote that would turn him human instead if resorting to silver?1 and kept his secret weapon in a place where he would need eons to get it? and that stuff ""i mixed magma from the vesuv with other stuff. could come in handy"" (something like that). and of course he wanted to create vampire offspring for ... for what??? I really hoped they would look like gremlins, for it would have shown that halsing was more of a crappy not funny homage, but no.a friend explained to me, why this movie was made: the production studio holds the rights to frankenstein drac and werewolf movies. On e moron must have noticed that, and thought they could make some money out of it, and bashed a film together with some special effects.there are more things to add, but i will try to delete the memory of this movie off my memory.to the people pout there don't waste ur time or even money for it.",Van Helsing
1037,amezerlily,Good enough,5,30 March 2005,"If you go into this movie without expecting too much, you won't come out disappointed. I didn't really know what to expect before I watched it, I just knew I wanted to, because in the trailers, I thought Dracula looked super cool. That might just be me, though.This movie is obviously not one that was made specifically for craft. The acting isn't marvelous by any means. It's actually a cheeseball of a movie, but it's a fun time none the less. If you're expecting some epic film - you'll get nice visuals, cool shots... that's pretty much it.I must say, the fake accents nearly drove me up a wall. I could live with Beckinsale's accent more than I could Roxburgh's. Personally, I feel Dracula would have been all the cooler if he /didn't/ have the cliché eastern European accent.All in all, it's a decent movie. Lots of questions left if you really think about it, but if you feel like being brainless for a couple hours, it'd be a good movie to spend your time with.",Van Helsing
1038,smitty1994,This was a COMEDY Thriller!,8,8 May 2005,"And worth watching if for nothing else but the tongue in cheek repartee between the characters. The costumes were outlandish and the weapons unbelievable but this is to be expected in an updated comic book-like storytelling of the legend of Dracula. Only someone with a seriously fractured funny bone could possibly fail to grasp that the action of exaggerated falls, flips and aerial acrobatics was anything but comedy! Come on guys, get a grip! This is a movie designed to be campy and entertaining, like the Batman or Starwars movies of past decades.Simply put, I liked it! And I also found it amusing to see so many character actors from other recently popular movies having a good time in this one. Look for the recognizable and not so recognizable actors from: Lord of the Rings, The Mummy, The X-Men and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. And watch for the lighthearted takeoff on the James Bond and Major Boothrow relationship. Try to guess who was who in what movie while you watch, and compare the actors performance in this movie to their other offerings. And note how Richard Roxburgh almost completely steals the show as the mesmerizing Old Count. To summarize, the movie is a delight for the young at heart, the fans of make believe and devourers of comic books. Folks, see it for yourself and judge! Have some fun! Get a bowl of hot buttered popcorn and a big cold drink and lean back for a rollicking good time and a goodly number of belly laughs at the antics of our heroes, Van Helsing, Anna and Carl vs. the villains, Count Dracula, Igor and The Brides.",Van Helsing
1039,tristoneian,Van Helsing,7,30 September 2014,"Van Helsing is not your typical movie. From being a fast paced action/horror movie, the plot is rather interesting. It keeps the audience's attention with all the action and all the circumstances faced.The actors fit so well into their roles. With the great acting the story had a great flow. The film sure went far into putting in great detail. To the actors, creatures, and the story line, Van Helsing was planned to be a great fantasy movie. This movie is highly recommended to people who love fantasy, action/ horror movies. The shots also add to the greatness of the movie. The locations are absolutely breath taking and the camera shooting techniques add great perspectives. Van Helsing is a monster movie that can't be passed up.",Van Helsing
1040,BMF3969,One hell of a good time!,10,26 October 2021,"The cgi may be a little dated, but try to turn the critical mind off and enjoy the movie for what it really is. Van Helsing is a love letter to classic Universal Studios monster films and it stands well on it's own. The cast led by Hugh Jackman, Kate Beckinsale, and Richard Roxburgh appear to be having a good time making the movie and it shows in the final product. The visuals including cinematography and set pieces are stunning at times and beautiful. This is a movie that is truly enjoyable and I cannot recommend it enough.",Van Helsing
1041,dvdba,"Satire,spoof or semi-serious?",7,11 March 2006,"Satire,spoof-or a semi-serious horror movie? Director/writer Stephen Sommers combines all three in this enjoyable flick which I dug up in my local library. Indicates it wasn't a howling box office or DVD success! Van Helsing is full of references to other past movies such as The legendary 1939 Hunchback of Notre Dame,starring Charles Laughton as the batty bell-ringer. I won't spoil your fun. See how many references you can spot yourselves. Then there are characters from other horror classic tales who make freaky ""guest appearances"" like Mr Hyde, played by marvellous British character actor Robbie Coltrane. Coltrane is equally adept at turning his hand to both comedy or serious drama such as the highly-acclaimed British crime series Cracker. So he's ideally cast in this deft mix of spoof and real blood-curdling horror. The plot - if you can call it one - revolves around the notorious monster hunter Van Helsing,played by rising Australian star Hugh Jackman. Being a Melbourne-based entertainment writer, I was familiar with Jackson's pre-Tinsel Town work. He first showed his star quality in an Australian TV prison drama Correlli where he played an inmate who had an affair with a female warder. It wasn't long before Hollywood beckoned the gifted young actor. I have a gut feeling that director Sommers told Jackman to adopt fellow Aussie actor Mel Gibson's transpacific accent. Because he sounds remarkably like Mel in places. The writer/director also has Van Helsing wear an Australian bush ranger's hat! A private joke between him and Jackman?! Another top down under thespian Richard Roxburgh co-stars as Count Vladislaus Dracula. What a superb performance,too. Roxburgh plays it dead straight - and there are some really spine-chilling moments. In fact,when the dark menace of Vlad appears, it's a scream a minute...as he stakes out his victims. He unleashes some truly horrible creatures-including the sexy lycra-clad Harpies,who are very lustful,vengeful ladies indeed (!) - and those terrifying teeth-baring,blood-drooling were-wolves. Stunning British actress Kate Beckinsale is the truculent Transylvanian Gypsy Princess Anna who attracts the attention of Van Helsing - and Dracula. Van Helsing's intentions towards the heroine are honorable - but the salacious Count only wants to sink his fangs into Anna's pristine white neck. The special effects creators have done a brilliant job on what I would think wasn't a massive budget. You can almost hear the studio props creak! Today's savvy film-goers want their special effects to surround-sound them out of their seats. But,nevertheless,director Sommers shows plenty of flair and I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more of his product-with bigger budgets-in the future. Meanwhile, it was great just to sit back and enjoy a cleverly-made movie.",Van Helsing
1042,speelmanja,Corny alert,5,14 August 2015,"The movie basically goes like this (Hue Jackemen)Van Helsing goes and kills monsters/ legends and then goes to his next kill for instance in the beginning he kills some kind of creature and then he gets his next assignment.The summery of the movie Van Helsing is in the world to rid all evil, even if not everyone agrees with him. The Vatican sends the monster hunter and his ally, Carl, to Transylvania. They have been sent to this land to stop the powerful Count Dracula. Whilst there they join forces with a Gypsy Princess called Anna Valerious, who is determined to end an ancient curse on her family by destroying the vampire. They just don't know how! The moral of the movie is really simple the good always win no matter what. I really didn't like the movie it was more for kids that where 7 and 13 year old kids it was very corny, there is one part in the movie where this bat lady flies up and is yelling at the little bats to kill the people or some thing like that. It was way to much drama it was like all the actors forgot how to act that or they just didn't know how to act it was embarrassing for me. The MPAA Rating is PG13If you like corny movies and over dramatic movies then go see it if your a 30 year old don't even waist your time.",Van Helsing
1043,kuzmanoskinikola,A shining beacon for fantasy adventure films,9,9 May 2015,"This is one of those movies that separate the movie lovers from the trolls and the bandwagon zombies. This movie has everything a good fantasy adventure needs: exciting action scenes, amazingly lovable franchise-worthy characters, amazing soundtrack, great costumes, great humor, a cool story and an AMAZING ending. Sure it has some flaws, but they are minor. If this movie was grittier and held on more tightly to the many moral and philosophical themes it touches upon for just a moment, it would have been the greatest monster hunter movie ever made. But even as it is, it is still one of the greatest. I am a lifelong fan of fantasy and have probably seen every movie in the genre and i can say that, in a sea of films that try to cash in on established characters by trying to do needless and terrible''reboots'', or films that are all but mediocre, this movie shines true as an example of how fantasy adventure films should be made. It will forever be one of those films that should have had many sequels.",Van Helsing
1044,georginaashdown,Good stuff,7,16 July 2005,"Having watched the film (more than once)i must say that i think that the person who wrote the comment ""A Stupid and Extremely Disappointing Movie"" is being silghtly childish. You cannot watch a film like Van Helsing with out taking it with a pinch of salt - it is a movie with vampires, werewolves and the frankenstine monster in at all at once for goodness sake. So you cannot go in to it thinking in a literal sense. You have to accept that it is not going to be some ground breaking epic and that it is just a bit of fun - but at the end of the day that doesn't matter, because if you go in with the right attitude and you enjoy it, then what does it matter that it is a bit ""off"" in places. I thoroughly enjoyed the film and would definitely recommend it to any one who likes action/fantasy films and is up for a bit of fun!",Van Helsing

1046,lilacdragon81,Disappointment,2,27 January 2006,"Terrible acting. Terrible accents. Terrible costumes. Terrible wigs. Terrible writing. The only thing that redeemed this movie at all was that Hugh Jackman did a decent job as Van Helsing (though I still think there's quite a bit of room for improvement) and the fact that it's an interesting concept and attempts to pay homage to the oldschool horror films, which is very cool. If somebody had gotten ahold of the script and filled in the plot holes, tamed the random wit, and given the movie some purpose... then it could've been great. Well, they would've had to fire 90% of the cast too (particularly Kate Beckinsale and whoever it was that played Dracula)... AND the costume designer.",Van Helsing
1047,joshy_boi_123,Van Helsing should go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time!,10,28 August 2005,"From the moment the movie started i knew it was soon to be my favourite. From the moment it begins to the moment it ends, the action never stops. From fighting a cross between the hunchback of notre-dame in Paris, to fighting count Dracula in his castle. I was astounded by how well the opening scene was choreographed with state of the art, special affects from the word go. there is never a glum moment, whether its Anna Valerious (KATE BECKINSALE) sprinting through the woods trying to escape from a CGI werewolf of its Van Helsing (HUGH JACKMAN) trying to shoot down three of Dracula's hideous air-born vampire wives with his mechanical bow and arrow in Transylvania. There are also many other astounding action scenes including, Anna's (Kate Beckinsale)brother turned into a werewolf after getting bitten by another while trying to save Anna, Count Dracula (RICHARD ROXBURGH, excellent acting) or the one, the only, Frankinstein's monster! You may be thinking its going to be trashy (stupid action constantly with no story) but you would be wrong. Van Helsing is sent to Transelvania to end the curse of the Valerious family by killing Dracula. Overall, Stephen Sommers (THE MUMMY, THE MUMMY RETURNS) has exceeded even his two previous blockbuster titles. I give Van Helsing a rating of 10. I have also received information that there will soon be a Van Helsing 2. (CAN'T WAIT!)",Van Helsing

1049,Skilbourn,Fun and Spectacular,10,22 October 2005,"I think that this is an all-around great movie for several reasons. 1. Considering that there wasn't a huge amount of money spent on the movie, they did really well with what they had. 2. The acting is great. I like Hugh Jackman as an actor and I think that he molded right into the part of Van Helsing. Kate Beckinsale always impresses me with her acting and I hope to see her in more movies in the future. I see that she has just completed another one and is working on another now. Wonderful! Keep it up, Kate! 3. The actors appeared to be having a great time making the movie. and the kind of wry humor that showed up throughout the movie - whether intentional or not - made it a fun movie to watch. The humor also made it easier to connect with the characters and use my imagination more to sympathize with the heroes of the movie. 5. The special effects and stunts were great! I imagined what the filming must have been like. I am greatly impressed with the actors' ability to perform around the combination of technologies that were used to accomplish the movie. There were many elements that, in imagining myself in their shoes, would have distracted me. Seeing this kind of work by actors helps me to appreciate what they do even more. 6. I thought the extras on the DVD were good and the commentaries by the director/producer and actors were good too. The commentaries add a lot to the movie and make it an even richer experience.",Van Helsing

To those of you who love/like this movie.... THANK YOU! To those who don't..... ARE YOU INSANE?! And to those who never saw it..... its a great movie to watch on a rainy day with a bunch of friends with a big big bowl of popcorn. I'll be honest and say that I have seen this movie over 15 times and it never gets old and I still crack up... don't get the wrong idea thinking that its a comedy... cause it's not. I laughed when the guy in Blade 3 was on fire and in American Werewolf in London when the guy was being torn to shreds. I don't know why, but people dieing in movies makes me laugh.

If you like a mixture of humor and action, with spectacular photography and a rich score, this is for you. While The Mummy is okay, Van Helsing is far more original and well-done in every aspect - a camp action masterpiece.

Lucky I had bought some food and drink ( seen as I was at the cinema) this kept me occupied, until it ran out. Then I had to pay attention. What I saw wasn't very amazing from what I can remember these deformed angel type things were after him. After a few hours I went to get a sweet from my pick n mix bag I looked up and saw that he had turned into a werewolf!

If people looked at them more as just visually entertaining with a bunch of sharp one-liners, and tried to stop making them the next big action movie, or trying to read a life change message somewhere in there, they'd have more fun! I loved the real mix of actors appearing in this movie - I was straight to IMDb after watching it to see if I was right or wrong about who played who. I especially liked the straight-in beginning - no credit break to kill the run of the film. The black-and-white beginning, going to colour soon after, was not new, but echoed nicely with the old Hollywood movies that the start was echoing. Altogether, a great fun watch. But that's just me!",Van Helsing

It substitutes a legitimate storyline with copious amounts of CGI, poorly rendered CGI at that. Hugh Jackman was doing well with X-Men, and then someone slipped him some acid and he decided to do this movie. It's one of those films where the only possible way to justify it is to assume that the filmmakers were not taking the movie seriously, that they intended it to be a campy farce of the classic Gothic heroes/characters. And however much I try to tell myself this, I really think the producers made this movie with the utmost sincerity, which is just depressing. If you're a fan of Hugh Jackman, or even Kate Beckinsale, please, for the love of Dracula, stay away from ""Van Helsing"".",Van Helsing

It seems like the main goal of the movie was to throw as many fictional horror creatures into a CGI mix as possible without violating any copy rights. The plot is weak, the acting is poor, the lines are horrendous. The CGI effects are well done - but this isn't the first time someone has done good CGI. Good CGI is expected for a big budget film made in 2004.

This is set in Transylvania in the 1800's. I don't believe they used that type of slang.

Played Anna and Van Helsing as if they were these characters. Richard Roxbaugh was such a surprise as Dracula. Brought this highly intelligent, selfish, and a bit curious creature to real life. Oh and Carl! I had no idea you were in ""The Lord of the Rings."" Wonderful performance David..:) Do love the style of Stephen Summer's movies and soundtracks. Will be curious on his remake of ""Flash Gordon"" though. Queen's soundtrack will be hard to beat Stephen....
