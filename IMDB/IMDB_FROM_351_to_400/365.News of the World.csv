0,MartinHafer,A very different sort of film for Hanks.,7,12 October 2021,"The plot to ""News of the World"" is pretty simple and it's a leisurely paced film...somewhat like Clint Eastwood's ""Cry Macho"". It is set in 1870 in the Reconstruction Era in Texas. Captain Kidd (Tom Hanks) is a Civil War veteran who happens upon a head man and a wild blonde girl in the wilderness. There are papers with the dead man's possessions indicating that the girl, Johanna, was abducted and raised by Kiowa Indians after her parents were killed. She was discovered with the Kiowa and the US Army sent her with an agent to return her to her extended family. But he's dead...and no one seems willing to help...so Kidd finally agrees to take her the 400 miles to Castroville, Texas (near San Antonio).As you'd suspect, this won't be easy since the child really wants to be with the Kiowa and she doesn't understand English. Her family were German immigrants...so she understands some German...but Kidd only knows a few words of the language himself. The film shows them on their journey across the Plains to her family.This is a most enjoyable film and a nice change of pace for Tom Hanks. It also talks about a seldom discussed problem which happened on rare occasions...white kids being abducted and raised by various tribes. Interesting and never dull.",News of the World
1,Leofwine_draca,Engaging little western,6,12 June 2021,"A good old-fashioned western from director Paul Greengrass, better than his last, the morbid 22 JULY. This one adopts a traditional journey narrative in its story of a grizzled Tom Hanks transporting a precocious young girl across the hostile West in search of her estranged family members. The news aspect doesn't really add much to the story, but Greengrass's superior direction is what makes this worth a watch. He brings in the suspense, handling it well in a lengthy set-piece in which limited firepower adds to the tension. Hanks is on form here and the whole thing is engaging, if not spectacular.",News of the World
2,SnoopyStyle,tripod,7,19 January 2021,"It's 1870. Former confederate soldier Captain Kidd (Tom Hanks) travels from town to town reading the newspapers for a paying audience. On the road, he comes across a lynched black man and a little white girl (Helena Zengel). She's a Kiowa child who apparently was taken from settlers many years ago. Kidd is forced to take the child back to her surviving family.Director Paul Greengrass is doing a John Ford western. It's sort of like The Searchers. Tom Hanks is doing his everyman. The little girl is terrific. They have good chemistry together. It's a very simple road movie. It's all good... except for Greengrass standard shaky cam style. It doesn't really fit the genre. He needs a tripod. There are a few scenes that need some work but mostly it's the shaky cam.",News of the World
3,boblipton,My First Movie In A Theater In Ten Months Was A Good One,7,5 January 2021,"Tom Hanks travels around Texas, reading newspapers from near and far to people who are to busy and too tired to do so for themselves. They pay a dime a head -- big money in Reconstruction Texas, with Federal troops on everyone's neck, fear of Kiowas, Blacks and Mexicans to people in charge. Hanks just goes about, reading, never dealing with the fact that he was a captain in the 3rd Texas Infantry, or the wife he hasn't seen in at least half a dozen years.One day on the road, he finds a hanged Kiowa with a badly-printed placard. He also finds Helena Zengel, whose parents were killed, and her carried off by the Indians, so long ago she only speaks Kiowa. No one in authority wants to deal with her, so Hanks finds himself toting her along until he can drop her off at her aunt's farm.Along the way, of course, they have adventures. I had the impression I was looking at a late 1960s A western, with Jimmy Stewart -- this is Tom Hanks, after all -- instead of John Wayne. There's even a role for Bruce Dern essayed by Michael Angelo Covino. I admired the way that Paul Greengrass's direction allowed character to be revealed gradually, and Dariusz Wolski's camerawork, always ugly, always fascinating, a world of brown dust. Tom Hanks plays decent, but wounded, and Miss Zengel seems to have based her performance on Patty Duke's in THE MIRACLE WORKER.",News of the World
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Interesting watch for the most part, even if real greatness is never achieved",6,15 July 2021,"""News of the World"" is a relatively new movie that I got to watch in an outdoor cinema last night and I would like to share my thoughts now . The director of these minimally under two hours is the established Oscar-nominated filmmaker Paul Greengrass and this is not the first time he has worked with Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks. He is of course the man you see on the photo here on imdb. And also not the first time in which the key supporting play garners much more awards attention than Hanks himself, even if it is a little girl. Back then, it was Barkhad Abdi (to an even bigger extent) and these two at least have the international background in common, even if it is entirely different regions of the world. Or look at Mark Rylance and how things went there. Definitely not a bad time to star alongside Hanks in a motion picture. For me, this one here was of course particularly interesting because the girl on the poster here on imdb is Helena Zengel who just had her big breakthrough with the film Systemsprenger not too long ago and immediately afterwards managed to get the role here and also make big waves internationally because she was nominated for an SAG Award (so recognized by her peers, kinda unreal in this context) and nominated for a Golden Globe as well. Shay may have missed out on the BAFTA nomination and eventually, more ""tragically"", on the Oscar nomination too, but still a super successful year for her. I must say that very early on in this movie here I was definitely reminded of Systemsprenger (I think the English title is ""System crasher""?) with her angry running around and screaming and even biting once it felt like something that could exactly have come this way from the character she played in the German movie. And honestly if we forget the different backgrounds, actors and locations for a second here, then this could almost be a sequel with Hanks' character finally managing to tame her what Schuch's couldn't. Anyway, enough of that now as those who haven#t see Systemsprenger or don't even know about it are certainly still the majority here and have no clue what I am talking about.As for Zengel, it can still be said that the role also suited her in terms of the character because she played an Indian girl with German background, so she speaks a few word Indian language there and very few German and English only, so no problem that she is maybe not super fluent in English. She didn't have to be. It was all about her physical presence basically and there surely is a lot there and I think she was a good casting decision, even if maybe the awards recognition was too much. The one really light moment, namely when her character discovers the taste of sugar, was very nice and memorable too. I still think Hanks and his performance should not have been ignore entirely the way they were by awards bodies mostly. He was pretty commanding as always, hit all the right notes and was the epitome of a lead performance really carrying the film from beginning to end. He did fine with the action sequence, there is some gunfire here with the western background for example on some occasions, but also the emotional sequences like when he finally manages to really say farewell to his wife (she was pretty young no?) and find closure there, so you could say that somehow he is ready for a new woman in his life by his side, even if it is just a girl and something like a father-daughter relationship. The subject of belonging was key here with nobody really ready to take the girl. Early on, the friends of the male protagonist she runs away from. Before the film starts, her people were killed even. Near the end, the Indians in the sandstorm were also not ready to keep her. I actually thought this was a Fata Morgana initially, but I guess the fact that they gave her a horse made it real. And in the end, there are of course those who basically treat her like a dog and tier her up, so she cannot run away and are also angry because she doesn't work. But the grave story at the very end with the knocking parts was some really cute closure.In general, I think this film worked nicely as a modern western. I'd also have liked to see Jeff Bridges or maybe even Mickey Rourke play Hanks' character. The ways in which all the dangers were depicted was also handled with competence. This include savage former soldiers driven by their genitals basically and the unspeakable things they want to do to the little girl and the officers there cannot really protect them, just give them a headstart. But this segment with Hanks' and Zengel's characters really working together as a team to save each other was nicely done. Also no pseudo drama with the leader of the guys not being dead initially or something. He gets the full load and is gone immediately. It was almost kinda positive waiting when we see his final aide run into doom with the bullets being real bullets and not just stuff to shoot birds. Okay, maybe the leader making this statement exactly there felt a bit too scripted. Then we have the other gang of bad guys, many more whose leader wants Hanks to support his leadership with fake news if you want to call it that, but there it was depicted in a convincing manner (maybe too fast) how information can raiise questioning and own judgment. It was still good, also the crucial moment in which the simple fella from earlier shows up and takes revenge for his brother and saves our heroes' lives this way. I still think a little less political correctness would have been nice here and there and the movie felt slightly too much as if wanted to please the mainstream media. One of not many criticisms I have here. There wasother than that just one quote I did not like, namely when Hanks' character tells Zengel's that they both have their own demons to face on this journey. That did feel a bit scripted and for the sake of it.Then again, it is all scripted as this was done by Greengrass himself with the help of Oscar nominee Paul Davies and the original novel is by Paulette Jiles. Apparently, this is her second writing effort that got turned into a movie and the first happened over 40 years ago and she played a little role in that movie back then even it seems and is still alive today. Well, no small role this time, but I am sure she can be happy about the outcome. Apart from the dangers through vile humans (this is set back in the days when racism was still a big thing in America, actually was, and not just stirred up, namely when it got closer towards the end of North vs. South back then), we also see how dangerous nature can be. Be it the horse going crazy on one occasion and almost killing them if they hadn't jumped of the thingey right on time, or be it the lack of water or be it the gigantic sand storm coming up on one occasions. You sure need a man like Hanks' character, former soldier to goide you through these challenges and he does so with dignity. He is almost too perfect of a character you could say overall. Maybe that is the reason why he never really scores acting nominations anymore. There are not enough shades and he is just the nicest guy ever, but still on the tough side. The best example was the other fella back when Hanks was home again who told him repeatedly that he could not have done anything.Okay, that is it then. This is a really good watch for everybody who likes Hanks and who is not opposed to western movies. Why would anyone be? It's an amazing genre for sure. Also German who care about Zengel's progress can definitely give it a go. But it is also good from every other perspective. It does not drag, which is quite impressive given the fairly massive running time, like almost never let's say. The writing is competent (cannot compare it to the book as I have not read the latter) and the acting is especially top-notch, maybe the film's biggest strength. Down to really small characters like the two the girl stays with temporarily at the end. Thomas Francis Murphy deserves a crucial mention as well as he did so much with not that much screen time. Massive thumbs-up and I also liked how his character is also a criminal of course, but at the same time a victim of the circumstances and the racist world he was born into. A leader for the dark side as a consequence in contrast to our hero. So don't be fooled into thinking that nobody except Hanks is famous here and therefore the cast is maybe not good. The opposite is the case. A prime example of how big names are not key for a good movie. Of course, also could have had to do with them really not wanting to take any attention away from Tom, which is maybe not the best approach, bit still it all turned out right in the end. The only question here is if it is a good or great film. The positive recommendation is never in doubt. Right now, I will go with ""good film"". Maybe another two stars on rewatch at some point. We will see. In any case, do not miss out on this one, preferrably watch on the big screen because those visual and audible components that scored Oscar nominations there are much easier to enjoy at your local cinema than on a small computer screen. But as long as you watch it, it's all good.",News of the World

6,kosmasp,Classy Western,8,13 March 2021,"In the good old days, this probably would have been made with John Wayne in the main role. And who wouldn't want to star in a movie that has that John Wayne feeling all along? I think Tom Hanks liked the idea as well he should. Add to that the German Wunderkind from ""Systemsprenger"" and you have a duo that seems to be made for each other.At first the young girl seems to reprise her angry alter ego from that other movie, but her character here is richer, even if the shades remain to a degree (for different reasons of course). The movie moves along at a nice pace and has everything a classic Western should have. Shootouts included - and an ending that is predictable but nonetheless emotional!",News of the World
7,classicsoncall,"""You belong with me.""",8,13 September 2021,"It seems most great actors eventually get around to doing a Western. You can go all the way back to Bogart and Cagney, heck, they even did one together called ""The Oklahoma Kid"". I could be wrong, but I don't think Tom Hanks has appeared in one before, a quick scan of his credits here on IMDb seems to suggest that he hasn't. So he gets his turn in ""News of the World"", and he does a fine job escorting a young girl of German background back to her relatives, after her parents were massacred by a band of Kiowa Indians, and raised as one of them. There did seem to be a disconnect in the story whereby Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd (Hanks) refers to a document he comes across identifying the scared youth as Johanna Leonberger (Helena Zengel). I'm unclear how he was able to make that connection; it seemed more like wish fulfillment than actual fact. Especially since 'Cicada's' time with the Kiowa seemed to be fairly lengthy, long enough to forget how to speak her native language and consider herself the daughter of Turning Water and Third Spotted.The wandering pair wind up in a handful of typical Western scenarios, dodging outlaws on the trail and in Kidd's case, inciting a near riot in the town of Erath. When I first heard this picture's title, I couldn't make sense of how it related to the story, but as it turns out, Kidd's occupation following the Civil War was traveling from town to town and reading the headline articles to each location's citizens for the fee of a dime. In Erath, Kidd cleverly relates the story of a Pennsylvania town that rose up against the rich owners of a coal mine who took advantage of their employees' poverty and lack of education. Johanna proves useful in several situations where by her observations and her wits, helps Kidd overcome the obstacles he comes face to face with.Though the resolution of the story is fairly predictable, it still manages to well up a heartfelt acknowledgment that Captain Kidd was no pirate, but a decent man who's loss of wife to cholera during the war finds a measure of relief by taking Johanna in as his ward and educating her to a new life on the road as an accompanist to his readings. The feel good ending is made more satisfying by Johanna's smiling face, as she pounds out the beat of a humorous story Kidd relates to his latest group of listeners.",News of the World
8,jboothmillard,News of the World,7,25 March 2021,"Not to be confused with the tabloid newspaper that ceased publication in 2011, I saw the leading actor talking about this film on The Graham Norton Show, and when it was nominated during Awards Season, I was up for it, directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum, Captain Phillips). Basically, set in 1870, Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd (Tom Hanks) is a former member of the Confederate Army who served in the 3rd Texas Infantry. Five years after the end of the Civil War, Kidd makes a living traveling town to town as a non-fiction storyteller. He reads the newspaper headlines about presidents and royalty, glorious feuds, devastating catastrophes, and gripping adventures from around the world to townspeople (most illiterate) for ten cents per person. Following an evening of news reading, setting out for his next location, Kidd finds an overturned wagon at the side of the road. Investigating, he finds the body of a black soldier and a young white girl (Golden Globe nominated Helena Zengel), dressed in Native American clothing and speaking in the Kiowa language. After an encounter with a Union Army patrol, Kidd is instructed to take the girl to Union officials at a checkpoint in a town up the road where they will sort out her Bureau of Indian Affairs paperwork and return her to her surviving family. Kidd reluctantly agrees to the request. At the checkpoint Kidd is informed that the Bureau of Indian Affairs representative will not be available for three months. Travelling to the next town, Kidd reads the news and seeks shelters with a former Confederate infantryman. After returning to the ten-year-old girl, whom he names Johanna (her real name is Cicada), he begrudgingly accepts responsibility for taking her to her surviving family. As they set out, they have difficulty communicating. Johanna was taken in by the Kiowa people six years earlier and raised as one of their own, so cannot speak English. During the journey, Kidd is confronted by three ex-Confederate soldiers turned criminals who try to purchase the girl from Kidd. He refuses, but the three men pursue, leading to a shootout in the wilderness during which Johanna and Kidd learn to work together to survive. They next encounter a radical band of militia working to ""cleanse"" the county from ""outsiders"". Kidd is told to read the approved news from the town's leader, but instead reads about a group of coal miners who rally against the man responsible for putting their lives in jeopardy. Kidd's story incites civil unrest, and ultimately results in Johanna gunning down the town's leader and rescuing Kidd. After this, Kidd and Johanna initially join a wagon train bound for the railroad line. They eventually veer off to locate Johanna's surviving family. During the journey, the wagon suffers an accident, going at high speed and unable to brake, Kidd and Johanna are forced to jump from the wagon, which crashes and is destroyed. The pair are forced to continue on foot through the heat of the desert, until they are found and rescued by a group of Kiowa. Johanna communicates with them and is able to obtain a horse. Kidd and Johanna eventually reach the farm of her aunt and uncle, the former revealing that Johanna's parents left to make it on their own and moved to hill country where the land is cheaper. They killed in a Kiowa raid. Kidd reluctantly leaves Johanna with them and returns to San Antonio. His wife, Maria Luisa Betancourt Kidd, died from cholera in 1865. He visits the mission where she is buried, and mournfully leaves his wedding ring and a locket on her grave. Kidd then rides back to the village where he left Johanna, where he finds her tied to a pole. Her aunt and uncle explain that she incontrollable, refusing to work and constantly running off. Asking forgiveness, Kidd tells Johanna (in Kiowa) that she belongs with him. Johanna accepts his apology and her aunt and uncle let them go. The last scene sees Kidd reading the papers in another town, with Johanna helping by making sound effects, and bearing a new name: Johanna Kidd. Also starring Thomas Francis Murphy as Farley, Elizabeth Marvel as Ella Gannett, Mare Winningham as Doris Boudlin, Ray McKinnon as Simon Boudlin, Neil Sandilands as Wilhelm Leonberger, Chukwudi Iwuji as Charles Edgefield, and Bill Camp as Willie Branholme. Hanks gives a good reserved and thoughtful performance, and Zengel proves a good young upcoming star as the mute child, this works well as both traditional of the genre and as a road movie, with exciting rocky shootout sequences, treacherous plains, and sweeping landscapes, it looks great and is engaging, a worthwhile western drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound, Best Production Design, Best Original Score for James Newton Howard, and Best Cinematography, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Sound, Best Production Design, Best Cinematography, and Original Score, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

9,paul_haakonsen,This was rather interesting...,6,27 August 2021,"For some reason then I have been putting watching the 2020 movie ""News of the World"" off until now in 2021. But I finally got around to watching it. And I must admit that I had been missing out on a good cinematic experience.This being a movie with Tom Hanks in the lead, chances were that the movie would be great. And truthfully so, ""News of the World"" was indeed a good movie. I happened to enjoy the storyline and the Western setting in which the story took place.The story told in ""News of the World"", as written by Paul Greengrass and Luke Davies was a story that quickly captured my interest and the progression of the story was well-paced. And the story was well brought to life with an interesting character gallery as well. So the writers definitely managed to come up with something wholeheartedly entertaining here.This 2020 movie is a nice addition to the Western genre, without it actually being an archetypical Western. So that was something that I certainly enjoyed about the movie.The actors and actresses in the movie were definitely nicely cast. Needless to say that having Tom Hanks in the lead as Captain Kidd was a great choice, and he really carried the movie quite well with his performance. And while I am not familiar with actress Helena Zengel, but she put on a good performance as well and really acted nicely opposite of veteran actor Tom Hanks.I am glad that I opted to sit down and watch director Paul Greengrass' 2020 movie, because it was definitely an enjoyable movie.My rating of ""News of the World"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",News of the World
10,Quinoa1984,"Medium=Message, you know the story.",7,16 January 2021,"This is so totally familiar and you know pretty much where it's headed. But that's a comfort sometimes of such movies like these, and the pleasure is how it's done - and Tom Hanks as Captain Kidd when he goes back to that town he's from and sees his friend and most especially visits his wife's grave is a solid reminder why he can so powerfully channel deep reservoirs of feeling (and in a different key than in his last time with Greengrass at the end of Captain Phillips, but no less true) - and in the details of how this man and young girl survive in the elements of the deserts of Texas. And it's one of the only Westerns I can think of that makes paramount the idea of education and communication what binds us and strengthens human connection. News of the World is a comforting blanket of a movie, and nice to experience (if you can) in a theater.I'll be a corny pile of stuff for a second (maybe it's also from doing driving instruction the past several months and having to learn how to speak with Spanish language students), but I think discovery and deepening understanding is what will make us last as a civilization. And if there's any real ""villain"" in this movie it's anti-intellectualism (also captivating given the genre), and the concept of people who are others as their proprerty. We get that with the fifteen minutes this becomes the most conventional part, though still thrilling and well shot and edited by Greengrass and company (and thank god he's calmed down on the hand-held) as Not Casey Affleck (seriously the dude sounds just like him) and his gang try to take the girl by force, and with that one Would-be Badass-But-Really-Loser in that town who would shoot you dead for not reading his own propaganda.And, again, a lot of this rests on Hanks and his underrated ability to do so much with a look, or a series of looks. And Zengel gives as good as he does.",News of the World

12,zardoz-13,The Novel Was Better!!!,5,6 February 2021,"""Captain Phillips"" director Paul Greengrass casts Tom Hanks in his first western ""News of the World"" as a gray-bearded Civil War veteran who rides through Northern Texas and reads newspapers to audiences willing to pay ten cents. Strictly speaking, he isn't the equivalent of a contemporary newscaster. Instead, he's more like those who read books for the benefit of the blind. A former officer in the Confederate Army, Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd served with the Third Texas Infantry, and he has the wounds to prove it. Sadly, Kidd's Maria wife died during the war from cholera, and our sexagenarian protagonist has embarked on a new occupation which heralds his gift of oratory. He leads a lonely existence, with friends scattered along dusty trails hither and yon. Kidd's routine is turned upside down when he encounters an abandoned, 10-year-old girl running loose in the wilderness. The black trooper assigned to escort her to an Army relocation camp has been lynched. The sign on his chest reads: ""Texas Says No! This is White Man's Country."" The daughter of German immigrants whose mother, father, and sister were butchered by ferocious Kiowa Indians, Johanna (newcomer Helena Zengel) has nowhere to run. Ironically, she identifies more with her former captors. She speaks a mishmash of Kiowa and German, and Kidd struggles to develop her English language speaking skills. Greengrass and Oscar nominated co-scripter Luke Davies of ""Lion"" have adapted Paulette Jiles' marvelous bestselling novel ""News of the World,"" but they cannot rival her splendid prose and penchant for obscure detail. Once she joins up with Kidd, Johanna travels 400 miles with the old timer as he searches for her Teutonic kin. They survive a number of incidents, some more exciting than others. Hanks' sterling performance, a weather-beaten supporting cast, authentic looking Old West towns, and ""Dark City"" lenser Dariusz Wolski's atmospheric photography cannot offset the monotony that undermines this character-driven, PG-13 rated sagebrusher. Western buffs may gripe about the shortage of shootouts, but Tom Hanks fans should relish watching him ride tall in the saddle.
Although it takes place during the 1870s on the Texas frontier, ""News of the World"" doesn't qualify as a traditional John Wayne western. The Duke did make one offbeat genre classic ""The Searchers"" (1956), with acclaimed superstar director John Ford, about a racist troubleshooter who rescued his niece from captivity among the Indians. Ironically, he had vowed to kill her if he found the Indians had brainwashed her. Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd emerges as far less complicated than Wayne's Ethan Edwards in ""The Searchers."" A widower who published a newspaper before the war, Kidd is a dutiful but decent fellow who hasn't reconciled himself with his wife's death. Nevertheless, he ushers little Johanna as far as an Army station. The officer-in-charge notifies him that the Indian Agent who handles strays won't be back for three months. Not for an instant does Kidd consider leaving the ten-year old to fend for herself around a notorious Army fort for any length of time. He decides to take the child to the agent himself. Along the way, Johanna and he forge a sense of respect and trust between them. Essentially, ""News of the World"" amounts to a scenic road trip, a journey of hardship where adversity peels back layer upon layers to expose both protagonists and antagonists. ""The Searchers"" dealt with adults. Comparably, ""News of the World"" recalls another Wayne horse opera, ""True Grit"" (1969). Cantankerous Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Wayne) took a precocious female teen on a ride through Hades in search of her father's cowardly killer. The tweener in ""News of the World"" also reminded me of the munchkin with whom crusty Gregory Peck found himself saddled in ""Shoot Out"" (1971) after Peck got out of prison and aims to payback the dastard who double-crossed him. Although Hanks doesn't play an invincible, larger-than-life man of action like either Wayne or Peck, his Jefferson Kyle Kidd fought in the American Civil War, and he is inclined to kill anybody who threatens their lives.
If you've seen enough classic westerns, the revelations in ""News of the World"" won't surprise you. Twice during their odyssey Kidd and Johanna tangle with obnoxious ruffians ready to kill them, while the remainder are made up of bland, non-violent moments. Alongside these two attempts on their lives, our protagonists survive a rollercoaster ride down a winding trail in a runaway wagon. The careening wagon out of control is about as exciting as this 118-minute movie gets when our hero and heroine aren't being used for target practice. Meantime, ""News of the World"" relies heavily on the surefire romance formula of opposites who attract. Eventually, as they shed their mutual suspicion, the two grow accustomed to each other. Initially, Johanna keeps Kidd at arms' length. By fadeout, however, she has thawed out and responds with warmth to her benefactor. Greengrass and company generate considerable tension with the depiction of ornery Texans who abhor the Union. Texas smoldered with anarchy during the post-war Era of Reconstruction. Indeed, an occupation Army of heavily-armed Union soldiers-derided as ""blue bellies"" by the locals--prowled the towns and halted the natives to scrutinize their loyalty oaths. Meantime, like some of John Wayne's later westerns in the 1960s, ""News of the World"" boasts one suspenseful gunfight that solidifies with surprising results the friendship between Kidd and Johana. Three low-down, no-account, ex-Confederate soldiers insist on buying Johanna, and these varmints refuse ""no"" for an answer. Instead of standing up to them, Kidd flees from them, lashing his horse relentlessly into a gallop. Careening his rickety wagon frantically through rough country, our hero doesn't outrun these hellions for long, and a cat & mouse shootout ensues. Altogether, the memorable scenes in ""News of the World"" never outnumber the mediocre ones. Altogether, Paulette Jiles' evocative prose in her novel lingers long after the film's stunning drone visuals fade away.",News of the World
13,evanston_dad,Too Timely?,6,26 March 2021,"Is it possible for a film to be too topical?Yes, when it's a western set in 1870 that tries as obviously as this one does to draw parallels to the world we live in in 2021. It's like the folks who made this movie were given a checklist of every single issue that's raised its ugly head over the last four years of our recent crappy history and decided that every one of them had to be shoehorned into the film somehow. I get it, the problems we have today are descended from problems that existed coming out of the American Civil War. I don't disagree, but there has to be a more nuanced approach to that idea than the one this movie takes.And I just really wasn't in the mood for a bunch of toxic white males acting like horrid human beings. I get enough of that in the news every day.This movie is at its best when Tom Hanks and the marvelous Helena Zengel share their bonding moments, but those moments are few and are overshadowed by scenes of horrible Texans doing bad things to just about everybody. I'm getting very tired of movies that have me rooting for awful things to happen to bad guys because of how monstrous they are.If movie award precursors are any indication, Zengel came within a hair's breadth of being nominated for an Oscar for this film, and it would have been deserved.

14,ferguson-6,Hanks in the saddle,7,25 December 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. Even in the midst of a pandemic, December is Oscar-qualifying time. And that means we get Tom Hanks' latest movie. This time out, the two-time Oscar winner reunites with his CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013) director Paul Greengrass (three ""Bourne"" movies, and Oscar nominated for UNITED 93, 2006) for Hanks' first ride into the western genre. Luke Davies (Oscar nominated for LION, 2016) adapted the screenplay from Paulette Jiles' 2016 novel.The beloved Mr. Hanks stars as Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd. We know his full name because he proudly announces it at each stop of his news-reading route. That's right, even in 1870, which is before television and radio and internet, a person could earn a living reading the news. OK, so it wasn't the millions that national anchors make these days, as he was dependent on the audience dropping a coin or two in the tin cup. For this they were treated to Captain Kidd's robust presentation of news and events (and some gossip) from around the nation ... straight from the news clippings he collected during his travels.On the trail one day, Captain Kidd comes across a horrific scene of violence, and a 10 year old girl with a shock of blonde hair. She only speaks Kiowa, but the found paperwork lists her name as Johanna (the first American film for Helena Zengel). It turns out, tragic events in her family's home many years earlier left Johanna being raised by the Kiowa Indians. Captain Kidd is now on a mission to return her to her surviving relatives (an aunt and uncle), but there are at least three obstacles to his plan: it's a rigorous trip of about 400 miles, the girl doesn't want to go, and there remains much tension in the split among the post-war citizenry. So what we have here is a western road trip (trail ride) that's a blend of TRUE GRIT (minus the witty banter) and THE SEARCHERS.It should be noted that Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd has served in three wars, including the recently concluded Civil War. He may make his living wearing bifocals and reading newspapers, but Kidd is no nerd. He handles pressure quite naturally, as we witness in chase scene up a rocky hill. The resulting shootout not only creates the first bond between Kidd and Johanna, but also flashes the Captain's calming influence. This is a soulful and principled Tom Hanks (as usual), but this time he's riding a horse and his furrowed brow is working overtime.The trip to Johanna's home coincidentally takes Kidd very close to where he once lived - a place that holds his best and worst memories. As viewers we see what Captain Kidd and Johanna don't. They are both headed back to a past they no longer belong to. Along the way, the two travelers cross paths with characters played by Elizabeth Marvel, Ray McKinnon, Mare Winningham, and the always great Bill Camp. There is nothing rushed about the story or these people. Fans of director Greengrass will be surprised to find an absence of his trademark rapid-cut action sequences, but he has delivered a sweeping epic with superb cinematography (Dariusz Wolski, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise), expert editing (Oscar winner William Goldenberg, ARGO), and a terrific score (8-time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard). Mr. Hanks delivers yet another stellar performance (of course), and young Ms. Zengel's assured performance likely means we will be treated to her work for years to come. It's a quasi-western period piece that is plenty interesting to watch, yet lacks the memorable moments to justify multiple watches or a place among the genre's best.

15,siderite,A snapshot of post Civil War America,8,24 March 2021,"Tom Hanks has made a career out of playing kind and reasonable men and this film is not an exception. Set right after the Civil War, the movie shows the story of an ex captain in the Southern Army who now lives by travelling from city to city and reading the news of faraway newspapers. He finds an orphan girl who is blonde but only speaks Kiowa and takes her on a trip to her natural German family. Themes of human kindness, racism, the evils of civilization and ""Texas says no!"" are lightly touched as we explore the desolate landscape of the southern Unites States.Now, the film is a bit slow. There are about five major things that happen in the entire film, which makes it feel a bit like a collection of anecdotes than a single story. Based on Paulette Jiles' novel with the same name from 2016.Bottom line: it's not an action flick. You have to give in to the rhythm of the story in order to enjoy it. The acting is good, the landscape shots really beautiful and overall it's an informative movie that reminds us where the U.S. came from, while asking the viewer to consider where it is going, and also without being heavy handed in any way.",News of the World
16,blanbrn,"Story of a messagner, a travel journey of will and emotional connection.",7,8 February 2021,"""News of the World"" is one touching emotional throwback style of film that can be classified as a historical drama and an adventure journey of hope and discovery. Set five years after the civil war an ex soldier Capt. Kidd(in a good performance from Tom Hanks) now not in battle travels and roams lands and countrysides telling stories and delivering news of happenings all across a still torn country. His life and journey is thrown into a wild card and spin while in his Texas travels he meets an innocent and precious young little lady named Johanna(the charming and wonderful Helena Zengel). The two bond and get to know one another.Along the way this film becomes somewhat of an epic travel journey and adventure like film with the drama of danger as the will to fight for life is ever present for both Capt. Kidd and little Jo(as she has a past connection to the Kiowa people). The story is entertaining as the acting and chemistry of scenes was in top notch form as it shows how travel and journey leads to discovery and new hope as it brings an emotional connection and new life for both of the two central characters. Overall watch if you enjoy historical like dramas.",News of the World

18,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Slow burning, but ultimately rewarding yarn",7,16 February 2021,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningCaptain Kidd (Tom Hanks) is a civil war veteran, scarred and haunted by the events that went on. He now travels from town to town, relaying world events to rapturous audiences who lap up his oratory style. However, things take an unexpected turn when he discovers Johanna (Helena Zengel) a young girl hiding in his carriage, who was abducted by Indians. Kidd makes it his mission to reunite Johanna with her parents, and, on the way, is forced to come to terms with his own demons.To a British audience, at least, at first glance the title News of the World, promised a scintillating glance into the goings on at the now defunct trashy tabloid and its eventual well earned downfall. Given Paul Greengrass's close up, realist style, that might have felt more like his natural habitat, as the outback setting at first glance doesn't feel like fitting terrain in this second collaboration with Tom Hanks after 2013's Captain Phillips, but it gradually manages to build in to something rewarding.It suffers from a dull opening, meandering and not really holding your attention in the right way, and requires your patience to stick with it, but it slowly develops in to something more engaging, forming the right sense of atmosphere and mood, and manages to draw you in. Hanks is reliably commanding in a role like this which he always does so well, and his young co star Zengel is also impressive as a near mute girl whose trust Kidd has to wean. Taking up most of the film's screen time together, they thankfully create an endearing bond.It struggles to find its way at first but, like it's two protagonists, eventually manages to find its way and work with its charge. ***",News of the World
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Some news doesn't travel.,6,19 April 2021,"Part of the sub-genre in which an older man has to escort a young child to safety, Paul Greengrass' latest effort is probably his least 'Paul Greengrassy' to date. 'News Of The World (2020)' doesn't feature an abundance of close-up cinematography, fast-paced action, shaky camerawork or chaotic tension. Instead, it's a slow-burning western with subtle but significant character work and a somewhat unbiased approach to its time-period, portraying the differing forms of racism - including the destruction of the Native American people - without ever really flinching. However, it isn't exactly an unflinching examination of American prejudice; these elements are simply treated as part of the landscape. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as it allows for the story to take place in a more realistic representation of the period in which it's set. It does almost feel like a bit of a missed opportunity, though, because the movie doesn't really say anything about these issues. It also doesn't really say anything about the complex history of the young girl at its centre, who was stolen by some Kiowa people just after her family moved to the US from Germany and is now ""an orphan twice over"". It's constantly on the brink of making a potent point about the definition of heritage and family, but it never quite does. Still, the effort is appreciated. Plus, the relationship between the two leads does evolve nicely - if quietly - over the course of the film, leading to an expected but satisfying finale. Perhaps the affair's stand-out scene is an elongated and suspenseful shootout that sees Hanks' aging captain stand off against three would-be child-traffickers with only a handful of bullets and bit of birdshot. It's a great scene that makes excellent use of its environment. Another high point is a moody and atmospheric sequence in which the protagonist pair are forced to do a news reading (which is the captain's profession) in a dangerous, buffalo-hunting, backwards-thinking town. In general, the film is enjoyable and engaging. It is fairly slowly paced, though, especially during its first act. It's also only ever so compelling, an issue that's difficult to describe but certainly contributes to the flick's overall quality. Even though its plot is very straightforward, it's a solid western that focuses more on character than anything else. 6/10.",News of the World

I really enjoyed the beginning and idea that the man is travelling and reading news to different regions/people/cities. It could be story how people learn something new, they change their life,society, now it's pity disappointing. I'm not critic or something so it's very subjective.Acting, effects and visuals were on point, everything looked high quality and something from those Texas time.

21,Cineanalyst,Itinerant Storyteller,6,19 February 2021,"As much as I enjoy Tom Hanks reading old-timey newspapers and contemplating the barren landscapes of a road trip, ""News of the World"" is lackluster for not much else going on for its two hours. The Western tale of a father-daughter relationship is uninspired. It hardly even echoes ""The Searchers"" (1956). And if Paul Greengrass and company were going for some sort of political commentary regarding the fake news of one town's so-called newspaper or the even blander historical admission of America's Civil War, lynching and genocide it fails. But, it's a nice-looking picture, and, yeah, I don't mind spending time listening to Hanks read. The man's a national--nay--world treasure.Of more potential, though, was the notion of a traveling storyteller as the protagonist. A nation torn apart, put back together again through a grand narrative of stories selected by this itinerant exhibitor of the nation's newsprint. ""News of the World"" doesn't demonstrate that, though. This is a fractured and violent world that's depicted, and a capricious one that may strike people down otherwise with contagion (cholera in this case). Hanks adopting a kid hardly rectifies that. Not that I expected a connection to be made in the movie, but I also think it's worth noting that this is largely how movies began and as based, if not necessarily on the newspaper variety, of showmen circulating other entertainments and novelties. At the turn of the century afore, cinema was introduced to Americans and the rest of the world by exhibitors going from village to city, fairground to opera house, assembling pieces of footage from various filmmakers and studios from all over and often adding their own narration to produce an evening's entertainment.",News of the World

Its a tent gathering, with everyone paying a dime to learn and to be entertained with Kidd's winning style. In truth, Kidd is a lost soul who has horrific memories of the war and the wife he left behind in San Antonio. One day, after a performance in North Texas, Kidd enters a woods and finds a child left on her own; her escort is dead nearby. This is Johanna (Helena Zengel) , once a child of German immigrants in Texas but captive four years with the Kiowa Native Americans. She calls herself Cicada and only speaks her adopted language, although she has papers which identify her. Most of all, she wants to return to the Kiowa but the US Army demanded all white captives be released before leaving the Kiowa alone. Thus, she's a lost, lonely, scared, angry little girl. Hanks is forced to be the one who is in charge of her safe return to an aunt and uncle in Castroville Texas, far to the South. They start out in a wagon with supplies and a single horse. Slowly, Johanna gets used to her new dress and boots, coffee, and learning English. Not liking each other at first, Kidd and Johanna bond well. But, there are perils on the journey such as dust storms and steep trails. The most horrible peril involves three men who want to ""buy"" Johanna to sell her into the sex trade (yes even back then!). Will they fight back against these dangers and make it to Castroville? This beautiful touching film has an abundance of assets. Hanks, of course, is always a fine performer but, here, even he is upstaged by Zengel. What a wonder this German child star is! Her eyes are big and expressive and she speaks Kiowa like she was born to it! In fact, her performance gives the film its ten rating as she is amazing.

29,zkonedog,Too Subtle & Understated For Its Own Good,5,3 February 2021,"""News of the World"" has all the elements that constitute a great film (Western in genre or otherwise): an interesting narrative/plot, beautiful cinematography, a generational acting talent, and a subtle social message behind it all. Unfortunately, every one of those aspects is played so subtly that the overall experience doesn't leave the viewer with much to chew over besides the base level of what is transpiring.For a very basic overview, ""News of the World"" sees Captain Kidd (Tom Hanks)--a Civil War veteran who now travels around reading newspapers to citizens--stumble upon a tragic ambush in which young Johanna (Helena Zengel) is left on her own. Johanna, taken by the Kiowa tribe at a young age, has no one but distant relatives standing between her and a life in orphanages (or worse). Somewhat reluctantly, Kidd agrees to take Johanna to those relatives, encountering a host of situations--both adventurous and enlightening--along the way.First and foremost, the biggest reason for the middling ranking is that I felt as if the Kidd character never really gave viewers enough to truly root for in terms of emotion. He's a good, decent man at the beginning of the film and a--good, decent man at the end (rendering the endgame fairly predictable by definition). It's not as if Hanks doesn't give a fine performance, because he does, but he's given so little range with which to work. I wanted director Paul Greengrass to let Hanks emote a bit more, but that wasn't in the cards for this picture.""News of the World"" also cultivates (at least initially) the interesting ""reading the news"" angle. This is clearly relevant in a post-Trump era. It portrays news as important and relevant to individual and community life. As with the acting, however, I wanted so much more of this thread. Besides a scene at the beginning and a scene at the end, it felt like the untapped potential here was almost criminal.Perhaps the best way to explain my ambivalence towards this film is in its closing scene. In it, Hanks gets to be, well, Hanks and indulges in a jubilant news-reading session full of humor and cheer. It was, truly, the first and only time I smiled--or emoted much at all--during the whole experience. By no means am I saying this movie should have been happy and cheery all around. But whether up or down, so to speak, I wanted the tone to really hit those highs and lows instead of taking such an even keel.Perhaps the best comp I can give for ""News of the World"" is 2014's ""The Homesman"", another movie that had all the necessary ingredients for success but couldn't pull them all together. As in that film, this one just remains too understated to ever elicit much viewer emotion.",News of the World
30,eddie_baggins,A pleasant but unremarkable old-school Western.,7,11 February 2021,"Renowned for his work on gritty thrillers such as The Bourne Ultimatum/Supremacy, United 93 and Green Zone, News of the World is without doubt the most easy going and dialed back Paul Greengrass film we've yet seen.An adaptation of Paulette Jiles novel, this Western set drama that reunites Greengrass with his Captain Philips star Tom Hanks (once more playing a captain, this time of the Civil War variety) sees the director put away the shaky cam/doco style of film-making that he made his name with and go about his business in a more typical and mild-mannered approach as we follow Hank's Captain Kidd in a new era of his life as he roams the wild west reading news and finds himself caring for orphaned girl Johanna after a chance encounter on the murderous plains of the American frontier.Selling to Netflix for a worldwide distribution after a brief cinematic run in the United States earlier this year, News is a prestigious looking film that carries a mid-tier level budget (plus some great work by renowned D.O.P Dariusz Wolski) and the presence of the always affable Hanks offers the film weight but despite the craftsmanship on display and notable turns from its lead actors, including a star making turn from child actress Helena Zengel, News isn't able to become a new classic of the genre as it struggles to become anything more than a pleasant diversion.Without expecting too much from the film and placing upon its shoulders unwarranted expectations there are feelings early on that News (a film that seems to share DNA with fellow western True Grit) will be that special type of old-school genre offering full of heart, soul and memorable moments and whilst there are sprinklings of wit, heart and soul throughout, the central friendship between Kidd and Johanna never excels and is never given time to properly flourish while the films various moments of despair and thrills are frequent but mostly unmemorable in their delivery.It's hard to put a finger on exactly what is missing in the film to make it click into gear to reach that next level but there's a distinct lack of movie magic here that would've made otherwise pleasing but forgettable set ups something more outstanding and there's a feeling that so much more could've been gained from various characters or instances that occur to Kidd and Johanna and while Hanks and Zengel do as much as they could've done with Greengrass's and Luke Davies script, considering the talent and potential here, News could've and perhaps should've been a new western classic.Final Say -A pleasing but forgettable old school Western that is missing a distinct if hard to describe charm and imagination, News of the World is solid stuff elevated by Hanks and Zengal but their respective characters and the world in which they live and breathe in had a lot more to give.3 1/2 tins of sugar out of 5",News of the World

As the movie opens, the Captain is somewhere in Texas where he is reading from local and national newspapers for a crowd that has paid 10 cents per person. The next day as the Captain is traveling top the next town, he stumbles upon a lynched black man, and a little white girl hiding in the bushes. From official papers, the Captain gathers this is Johanna, who was being trasported back to her family after having been kidnapped by Natives. The Captain tries, and fails, to drop Johanna off at the nearest army point, and in the end he is resigned to take Johanna to her family 400 miles away... At this point we are less than 15 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would s;poil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest from director Paul Greengrass (best known for various Bourne films). Here he reunites with Tom Hanks (folllowing 2013's ""Captain Phillips"") to bring what in essence is a western road movie set not long after the conlcusion of the Civil War, let's just call it the 1870s. This is the big screen adaptation of the book of the same name by Paulette Jiles. I haven't read the book and hence cannot comment on how close the movie sticks to the book. What I can say is that this is a very comfortable, if not predictable, western road movie. I mean, there really isn't a single surprise or plot twist that had me thinking ""wow, I don't see that one coming!"". That is not to say that this is a 'bad' movie. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit, none more so than the lead performance from Tom Hanks, who is in virtually every single frame of the movie. I am going to go on record already that Hanks will get a Best Actor Oscar nomination, and in fact he may even win it. It blows the mind that 2020 marks 40 years of Tom Hanks on the big screen (his 1980 debut? ""He Knows You're Alone""). What better way than to get a star vehicle like ""News of the World"" provides.""News of the World"" premiered on Christmas Day in a limited theater run (the movie shifts to Netflix in mid-January). The New Year's Eve screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 15 people, which is peanuts in 'normal' times, but is about the largest theater crowd I've seen since I started going back to the movies in early September for ""Tenet"").

This is Tom Hank's first western movie-not counting when he played a cowboy named Woody-and it's a good movie but a little slow at times. Tom plays a Civil War veteran that travels from town to town, telling people the latest news that he usually reads from newspapers. On the road, he comes across Helena, a 10 year old girl that has been living with the Kiowa Indians for 6 years and is now homeless-she was kidnapped by the Kiowa. Tom takes her to a nearby town where he knows a couple there that might be able to take care of her. Ray & Mare are the couple but Helena is too much for them to handle. Tom finds papers on Helena stating her name and where she was originally from so he decides to take her to live with her aunt & uncle about 400 miles away. The rest of the movie is Tom & Helena facing humans-both Indians and scoundrels-and the natural elements in their journeys. Like I said, it's a good movie but a little slow-I don't think Tom Hanks can make a bad movie.

38,kevin_robbins,There is so much to like about this movie from beginning to end. I strongly recommend seeing this.,9,22 May 2021,"News of the World (2020) is a movie the Mrs and I caught in theatres during the pandemic. The storyline focuses on a man who makes a living by collecting newspapers and going town to town in the west reading it to the locals who unfortunately cannot read or keep up with the ongoings of the world. One day he comes across a little girl who was caught by the native Americans and later deserted. He is left to take care of her and decides to take her to her closest kin. In his voyage we see how savage the world really is during this period...and how the white men are truly the savages and ill informed. This movie is directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93 and Bourne Ultimatum) and stars Tom Hanks (Forest Gump), Helena Zengel (System Crasher), Tom Astor (Mile 22) and Bill Camp (Joker and 12 Years a Slave). The storyline, cinematography, grit, landscape, backdrop and costumes were all out of this world in this movie. This picture does such a great job of depicting some of the challenges of the settlers, the uniqueness of how people lived and scrapped by, and the ignorance that has plagued this country since its inception. The acting, dialogue and resolve of each character is presented so well. There is so much to like about this movie from beginning to end. I strongly recommend seeing this and would score it a 9/10.",News of the World
39,alindsay-al,An Average Let down of a film,5,11 February 2021,"So another film that was meant to come to the Cinema in the UK but made its way to Netflix is here and it is the new Tom Hanks film News of the World and here is my review for it. The premise of the film is set in 1870 and sees a war veteran agree to take a stranded girl to a place she can call home.Main Character
This is probably the most obvious thing about this film but Tom Hanks is really good here, I mean when isn't he good. He has such a presence on the screen and is easily the best thing here, his character isn't the most unique ever but Hanks manages to elevate him and make him an interesting character and one that you can easily root for.Supporting Characters
This film doesn't really have many supporting characters, it is just people coming in and then leaving before you get the chance to get interested or give an appraisal of their performance. This is of course not true for the main supporting character the young girl played by Helena Zengel and I read that this was her first ever English speaking film so maybe I should be lenient on her but I just can't be because I just found her character annoying. I'm pretty sure it's not her fault but the character was written poorly and the only reason I cared about the plot and things is because of the strength of Hanks performance. Hopefully Zengel keeps doing English speaking films as I think there is quality here and maybe she just needs a bit more experience.Story
The story was a mixed bag for me, Hanks personal story and development as the film progresses is well handled and Hanks does a great job with that and seeing these characters travelling through the west is pretty cool. But I also felt very little actually happened, it is like these mini stories that don't connect very well and it was just these two people going through the west with little direction. Also the ending is really predictable, no spoilers but it goes about as you would expect which is a bit disappointing.Script
The script is okay, kind of like the story Hanks delivers some great lines and his character is well written but the rest of the film isn't that great. I didn't fully buy into the relationship between the two of them and as I said before the film is split into smaller parts and it doesn't quite work and feels like a bit of a hodgepodge of stories.Style
The style of the film visually is fantastic, the West looks amazing and I think this film deserved to be seen in a cinema because it has a great look. But this film is very slow paced and it really holds the film back, if the story had been better then maybe it could have worked but I was just waiting for it to get going.Overall
Overall, I had high expectations with Tom Hanks & Director Paul Greengrass but this film let me down. It is just a very average western with a good lead performance and nothing else that stands out. If you like westerns and Hanks then maybe give it a go but it won't be one I ever rush to see again.",News of the World

45,kluseba,Inspiring hope in rough times,8,25 February 2021,"News of the World is an emotional western drama set only just after the conclusion of the devastating Civil War. Veteran Captain Kidd has lost his wife to a disease while being at the front line. He tries to escape his grim past by traveling through the country and reading newspapers to citizens in order to inspire change and hope. One day, he comes across a carriage that has been knocked over. The driver has been brutally murdered and the only survivor is a young girl who doesn't speak English. Captain Kidd discovers that her name is Johanna and that she got kidnapped by the Kiowa as a child when they murdered her entire family. She has spent most of her childhood with the Kiowa and her identity is much closer to Native American culture than to her German origins. Captain Kidd plans on bringing her to her aunt, uncle and cousins but the two protagonists have to travel through the entire state of Texas for about six weeks to get there. On their challenging journey, they come across human traffickers and radical militia and must face carriage accidents and sandstorms.This wonderful western convinces on numerous levels. First of all, the characters are truly intriguing with the grieving, kind-hearted and well-mannered captain and the wild, lost and intelligent child. The acting performances by Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel are absolutely outstanding and would certainly deserve Academy Awards nominations. The different segments of the movie are truly intriguing as well as the protagonists come across hateful and helpful characters and face beautiful and dangerous natural phenomenons. The locations have been chosen with care and bring the war beauty of the Wild West to life in an authentic way. The camera work is calm and precise, the sound effects are immersive and intense and the soundtrack underlines the movie's atmosphere perfectly.Even though the movie might have a few minor lengths here and there, News of the World is one of the greatest contemporary westerns in recent memory. The excellent acting performances, profound characters and diversified plot shouldn't only please genre fans but anyone craving for a heartfelt drama with some tense action scenes. This movie hasn't received the attention it deserves due to the pandemic, so make sure to watch it once cinemas in your region are reopening. While Tom Hanks confirms his status as one of the greatest actors of all time, News of the World is also the breakthrough performance for young German actress Helena Zengel who will hopefully be casted for further Hollywood movies instead of wasting her precious talent on sleep-inducing German televison movies.",News of the World
46,masonfisk,CAN HANKS DO ANY WRONG...?,8,4 January 2021,"Tom Hanks reunites w/his Captain Phillips director, Paul Greengrass (Flight 93/Jason Bourne), in this Western which deals w/a news reader trying to bring a white child (who's family was killed & raised by Indians) back to the only living kin she has after he discovers her initial transport was killed as well. A former Civil War soldier who fought for the South at the expense of his wife (who died of cholera waiting four years for him to come home) now plies his trade as a newspaper reader (presented as a show of sorts to the masses who probably at that time didn't know how to read or were looking for any kind of entertainment) who still commands a modicum of respect & stature even at this stage in his life so when he comes upon the blonde waif, played by Helena Zengel (who calls him Captain, I guess an unintentional refrain from Captain Phillips), he's incapable of not doing the right thing by escorting the girl to a nearby town who tells him the nearest Indian agent is miles away which he reluctantly does & then again when he hits a wall there, he decides to bring the girl all the way to her nearest relations (an aunt) defending against a trio of bandits hoping to steal the girl & a hostile town where mob rule has taken root & the defacto leader wants to use Hanks to his whims (which backfires by the by!). If you've seen enough Westerns (here's my 'hold my beer' moment!), this is isn't exactly new ground but since movie Westerns have gone the way of the dodo, any time a modern filmmaker takes a stab at an oater, it should be welcomed & appreciated (w/selections like Netflix's Godless or even something like Cowboys Vs. Aliens, you won't be disappointed) which Greengrass does exceedingly well here. Also starring Ray McKinnon & Mare Winningham as a couple Hanks leaves Zengel with at the outset, Elizabeth Marvel as another person Hanks has some history with & the current character actor du jour, Bill Camp (last seen in the Netflix hit Queen's Gambit as the janitor who teaches the prodigy about chess) seen here as a hometown friend of Hanks.",News of the World

52,jadepietro,"Go West, Old Man!",8,23 January 2021,"IN BRIEF: Fine direction and an understated performance by Mr. Hanks elevates this familiar western tale and its conventional storytelling.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) Moviegoing has always been an escape from the news of our world and News of the World, a highly entertaining western tale by Paul Greengrass, is a fine respite that makes its presence known. The film definitely has a ""been there, done that"" vibe as it follows a predictable road trip through glorious American panoramas in very uncertain times. The story takes place in 1870, but the parallels from then and now are strikingly similar with today's contemporary issues of racial hatred, a dreaded disease debilitating the country, the still pressing issue of real vs. fake news, and a polarized nation unable to come together. Subtle, surprisingly yes, but revisionist, absolutely also. To its credit, the film avoids preachy sermonizing as it concentrates on its interesting characters and their misfortunes.Set in the post Civil War Texas badlands, former Confederate officer Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd (Tom Hanks) travels the country sharing news stories at ten cents a read. His profitable form of stage entertainment, a traveling one-man show-and-tell, allows him to encounter a cross-section of America strife. One day between engagements, he discovers an orphaned white girl named Joanna (Helena Zengel) dressed in Native American garb and only speaking the Kiowa language. He decides to take her back to the safety of her family and inherits the role of her temporary guardian. Their trek together and their eventual bonding is the main scenario in this mediative tale of kinship.The screenplay by Lucas Davies and the director is quite formulaic as the lonesome twosome run into many obstacles along the way (outlaws, profiteers, natural disasters), but the dialog is literate and insightful, even if the plot literally moves from one peril to the next. But the film is is so beautifully made and a worthy throwback to its Western genre. Mr. Greengrass tells his tale with vigor and style by allowing his characters and their relationships to build gradually. The production values are top-notch with Dariusz Wolski's sweeping photography and James Newton Howard's lyrical music score contributing to the film's sense of grandeur. At the midway point, there is the film's major set piece, a thrilling shoot-out in the Texan foothills, extremely well edited by William Goldenburg. This memorable sequence is wonderfully staged and brimming with tension, though nothing else in the movie attains that accomplished level of excitement.One of the foremost reasons for the film's success is the central casting of Mr. Hanks as our protagonist. The actor is thoroughly convincing and creates an indelible character of a descent man dealing with his own internal hardships and still trying to move forward. His nuanced portrayal is so skillfully performed that it is easy to overlook its overall impact. As his charge, Ms Zengel gives a totally natural performance. She may not be a young Natalie Wood circa The Searchers in her almost identical role, but Ms. Zengel is far more compelling and does not pander for moviegoers' sympathies. Solid support in minor roles comes from stalwart actors that include Mare Winningham, Elizabeth Marvel, Bill Camp, and Ray McKinnon.News of the World is a solid Western trope that may be too conventional in its storytelling, but it is nevertheless a rousing good time with Mr.Hanks and company.

Review:There is one thing that continues to show improvement and that is how the camera work can capture a lot of the beautiful of the world. News of The World is a stylish, gorgeous display of the Western frontier and instilling with it the wild west nature of this genre. Through the use of various filters and natural setting to really craft the different levels of danger the 1800s wilderness provided. Costumes and makeup only further helped bring out the gritty nature of those days, and establish the danger of the outlaws that inhabited them. Bringing you into the world, the western frontier really unfolds, and brings you back into what made these types of movies shine in the past. The realism really helps with this, ditching aliens, stunts, and flashy scenes to instead take on a more down to earth movie. As Captain Kidd (Hanks) and Johanna (Zengel) continue to traverse the wilderness, one really feels the emotions of the scenes, the desperation of each step and trying to adapt to the situations at hands. Though not as exciting as some of my favorite Western movies, Greengrass and company have come up with clever ways to face the odds (mostly) and use some well-time monologues, strategy, and even kindness to assist the bravery and find a solution. One of these moments is a very good action scene that might not be flashy or filled with stunts, but still is suspenseful in the dark nature of the fight. The real life fight offers strategy given the odds, and has just enough draw out and planning to make you think twice about what the outcome will be. For me, it's brilliant because not only does it sort of add diversity to the film, but it also allows for some unorthodox character growth that movies struggle with these days. Each of these chapters on the adventure push our characters to face different demons, gradually changing them and trying to practice the lessons that each are trying to teach each other. All of this comes from great acting by the two leads, a sound chemistry between experience and new age that perfectly captures the dynamic they wanted. Hanks has another movie to add to his repertoire of awesome acting ability. His character is straightforward, and yet complex and Hanks hits all the marks as the scene requires, while seldom overcommitting to the part. As for young Zengel, for a role that primarily consisted of grunting, speaking different languages, and nonverbal acting, she accomplished this very well. Many roles like this are often more annoying than well done, but the direction of this film avoided that territory for the most part and knows just how much it takes to deliver the message without tearing my ears off in the process.
All of this good though does start to wane in some departments though, especially near the end where things seem to drop into a rushed mess. First of all, while not the fastest movie to begin with, the last thirty or so minutes really feels dragged out and a mess. Things that were swiftly moving suddenly rush into a few scenes that seem to hit a wall and then become ridiculous, not as exciting, shallow finishes that seem to drag on and on. A shame given the quality, and though it does complete the circle of events, it really felt the most off for me given the way the rest of the film presented. Many of those moments seemed shoe horned in, a visit to one location, a sudden storm that would reveal something elusive, and even the final destination were all so last minute to me that it lacked the full punch I think they were going for. One impasse in particular violated my cardinal rules and given what happens about eight minutes later, was completely unnecessary given the consequences that were seen (did not like this scene at all). And ironically, the last minute answers, and filling those holes were both needed, but not needed given how it extended the film to unnecessary lengths. About twenty minutes of the movie could have either been cut or condensed to give me the same information and still not bore me to the point of fighting sleep. Though this film has much more depressing elements than others, it's this end point especially that sucks the life from you and makes you question many things. Yes, for those that are fighting the 2020 blahs, this movie may not be for you given how tough grit it is, so exercise that caution before departing on the trail.The VERDICT:The high marks from rotten tomatoes and film credits are right in their remarks of how visually amazing this film is and how it's a breath of fresh air in regards to the movie telling. News of the World trades flair for being there and drops you back into the Wild West Frontier that captured so many young minds along time ago. Realistic travels, a world that is dangerous and engrossing, with very fitting moments are just some of the highlights to this film. Though this reviewer feels it's the acting and most of the character development that deserves praise as the strongest aspect of the movies. Despite all the good though, the movie's main weaknesses for me are the depressing nature of the film and the end where things seem to be sort of crammed together and yet extend the film. Taking all of that in, the results of the movie for me are;Action/Adventure/Drama: 7.0

A simple, slow-burning but engaging travelogue-style action drama, this Western boasts some fine performances coming from Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel. Their well-developed bonding is a treat to watch, and how their conversations surpass the evident language barrier is a great metaphor.Director Paul Greengrass, better known for the fast-paced Bourne films, does a splendid job directing a slow, simple, grounded film about an old newsreader and a new mission that changes his life. The concept sure doesn't sound new but the film totally takes advantage of it and that is evident from the ample investment in characters. Also, Greengrass holds attention with the action sequences devoid of his usual shaky camera technique, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The central shootout scene, for example, is not merely well choreographed or filmed, but also written intelligently a served with a suspenseful tone for an otherwise dramatic film.The film's plot centers around a journey, and hence it feels like a collection of several episodes, which is suitable given the theme. The score by James Newton Howard is captivating, and a reason enough to stay during the credits. The cinematography is splendid, capturing the picturesque locales with brilliance. Editing is also good, as the pacing doesn't remain the same throughout and changes as per the scenes, which becomes evident especially during the action sequences.All in all, this is a heartfelt Western, and those new to the genre can be convinced to explore it more after watching this film. It has got all the right elements to cater to majority of viewers, ranging from strong performances to captivating drama to thrilling action scenes to adventurous locales.

Since it got announced that Tom Hanks was gonna star in this film that's how long I've looked forward to it. Paul Greengrass have showed multiple of times with films like the Bourne trilogy and Captain Phillips that he's a great filmmaker, seeing him tackle the western genre made me excited and he didn't disappoint.
The story is set in 1870 and follows a Civil War veteran who must return a young girl who was taken in by Native Americans as an infant to her last remaining family.Tom Hanks plays Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd and Helena Zengel plays Johanna Leonberger/Cicada. Their performances are one of the film's highlights, they are very good and realistic. Tom Hanks nails the accent and overall feeling of a person who lived in 1870 whilst Helena Zengel brings a terrific performance and had to learn Kiowa which deserves praise.
The supporting cast has for example RayMcKinnon and Elizabeth Marvel, there's of course more actors in the cast but it's mostly just smaller roles as the film is about Captain Jefferson Kidd and Johanna Leonberger, and their journey, their travels.The director, Paul Greengrass has the visual storytelling on point, using the show don't tell to show off backstory for our protagonists. Overall superb direction.
The cinematography is breathtaking, such a nicely shot movie. There's not much more to say other than it deserves a nomination for best cinematography.
The musical score was done by James Newton Howard, it's one of his best of those I have heard. The soundtrack has so many instruments authentic to the era, both from Native American and regular, mixing them both for a perfect and powerful score that's full with suspense.
The sound design is incredible, every single sound in the movie feels so real and it makes it so easy to get immersed.Now this film is far from an action movie but there is gunfights in it, some of the realistic ones I have seen, they nailed the sound and effects. But most importantly, the realistic and brutal ways of gunfights.
The whole film is well made, some of the finest piece of cinema I have seen. The whole production design is top notch, you'll see some stunning set pieces and a western worth remembering.News of the World was named one of the ten best films of 2020 by the National Board of Review, and I agree fully with them. If you're a fan of westerns or just interested in a period film then you'll lost likely enjoy this one, I strongly believe that there's something for everyone in this film. They managed to create a fantastic film filled with incredible acting and memorable set pieces. But I do understand that it isn't for everyone because of the slow pace but I felt it fitted the tone of the film perfectly and how they travel. It gave the writers and director time for character development and for us viewers to really get to know the characters.",News of the World
64,bankofmarquis,Stongly acted and directed,8,17 January 2021,"Pound for pound, Tom Hanks is the best actor of this generation. From his big screen debut in SPLASH to his Oscar Nominated turn in BIG to his back-to-back Oscar wins for PHILADELPHIA and FORREST GUMP to more recent works like SULLY and THE POST, Hanks' ""everyman goodness"" quality shines through the screen and makes him a screen presence that cannot be ignored.And in his latest effort, the Paul Greengrass Directed NEWS OF THE WORLD, Hanks uses every molecule of his screen presence to keep the audience's attention in a slow-paced, moody character study.Based on the novel by Paulette Jiles, NEWS OF THE WORLD takes place in a post-Civil War Texas where a former Confederate Captain makes a living by going from town to town and reading the news to them. A chance encounter with a twice orphaned young girl alters the lives of both of them.Writer/Director Paul Greengrass is most known for quick-cut action films like the BOURNE series or the criminally underrated GREEN ROOM, so he would seem - at first glance - as an unusual choice to adapt and direct this character study, but look further at Greengrass' resume and you will find - in films such as UNITED 93 and CAPTAIN PHILLIPS - an ability to tell a story that is driven more by character than by action.And this combination of Director and Actor works well for NEWS OF THE WORLD is a languidly paced piece that has a somber mood and look but Greengrass avoids the temptation of lingering on scenes or pictures too long (and there are some wonderful images captured by Greengrass and Cinemotgrapher Darius Wolski) to tell a story of a man who needs to rediscover and remake himself.And Hanks is more than equal to the task of bringing the pragmatic, introspective Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd character to life in a way that makes him intriguing and not boring. Hanks ability to show inherent decency in a look or a gesture is the stuff of legends and when he speaks, you listen. Which is good for Hanks is in every scene in this film and his performance needs to strongly capture the audience for this film to work - and he is more than equal to this task - so strong is Hanks in this role that I would not be surprised if there is another Oscar nomination in Tom's near future.Newcomer Helena Zegal is ""just fine"" in the other main role in this film - the young girl that Captain Kidd encounters, Johnna. This young girl is silent and shut down for most of the film and Zegal performs ""shut down and silent"" well. Also along for brief cameo roles of characters that Captain Kidd encounters on his journey is a bevy of wonderfully cast character actors that include Mare Winnigham, Ray McKinnon, Bill Camp and the always interesting to watch Elizabeth Marvel.As is often the case in these sorts of films, the music/soundtrack becomes a vital part of the story that unfolds and 8 time Oscar nominated composer James Newton Howard (THE PRINCE OF TIDES) is more than up to the task. The music is another character in this film and helps set the mood along the journey.But make no mistake, this is Hanks' film - and he is VERY good in this. Like MIDNIGHT SKY (reviewed last month), this movie will not be for everyone - and many, many folks are going to tell me that they checked this movie out on my recommendation and were bored by it. But...if you click into the mood, motion and energy of what Greengrass is showing, you will be rewarded with an emotionally rich and complex character study.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",News of the World

68,tonypeacock-1,A western film that shows the drama side rather than the gun battles galore,7,14 February 2021,"The Western genre is retrod with great effect in this film from 2020 that has a story that veers away from the traditional western film screenplay clichés of cowboys and Indians and delivers an emotive story from the era.In a nutshell we have a Civil War veteran played by Tom Hanks, Captain Jefferson Kidd who goes from town to town reading newspapers/the news to willing audiences. It is a stark reminder that 24 hour rolling news channels and social media didn't exist in the period that the film is set, 1870. How old are the newspapers he reads from. I have no idea!After one such reading and travelling to the next location Kidd stumbles on an overturned wagon in the road and a dead black soldier and young white girl dressed in native Indian clothing. Still alive. A girl who speaks no English but Kiowa. A language of the Comanche tribes.The girl is played by Helena Zengel, a German actress. Her performance in the film is a highlight.Reluctantly Kidd looks after the girl until she can be returned to her surviving family. However when he gets to the next town, the Union officials tell him that the representative of the Bureau of Indian Affairs who will sort out her paperwork is away for three months! He either looks after the girl or abandons her basically.The film reminded me of films such as True Grit (1969 and 2010 remake) with the older battle weary character and a younger girl character.The film features sweeping cinematography that would look fantastic on a large cinema screen but still is great on a television screen and defies its streaming platform release in international territories. The landscapes would do John Ford proud!As Kidd transports the girl across a dangerous Texas environment to the girl's surviving family he encounters criminals who wish to purchase the girl. Hanks character Kidd at one point attempts to reason like the characters in one of his other film collaborations with director Paul Greengrass, Captain Phillips (2013).In another scene we see his ex-army skills being used to full effect in a shoot out complete with assistance from the girl who by now we learn has an Indian name of Cicada.Director Greengrass rightfully has earned plaudits for his direction of the film. In another scene we see Kidd incite civil unrest against a radical band of militia.After the girl is delivered to her aunt and uncle and exploration of Kidd's own history in which his wife died. Kidd returns to the village to see Johanna cruelly tied to a pole like a dog and takes her away.Hanks is great in these films although I have never seen him in a western as such.",News of the World

It is a robust, beautifully shot drama, and while little unexpected transpires, the characters are so richly drawn and their travels so wonderfully realized.

Drew me in and captivated me throughout.,9,10 February 2021,"The Captain (Hanks) and Johanna (Helena Zengel) have some heartwarming chemistry and are two characters that share a wonderful story.I didn't expect this to be so touching. It has one of the best endings I've seen in a long time. I also didn't expect a few laughs along the way. It manages to succeed in being gritty, heartwarming and meditative at the same time.I quite enjoyed the pacing. It felt like a road trip film with a western touch. The action scenes are clearly a specialty of Greengrass' too, even though this story doesn't require many. The tension and suspense was really effective.Hanks was phenomenal (as usual) and I often forgot I was watching a Tom Hanks movie. I thought he was excellently cast in the role of the Captain.

75,MrDHWong,Frequently treads familiar territory in terms of storytelling but makes up for it with its solid acting and directing,8,28 January 2021,"""News of the World"" is a Western film based on the novel of the same name by Paulette Jiles. Directed by Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, United 93, Captain Phillips) and starring Tom Hanks in the lead role, it frequently treads familiar territory in terms of storytelling but makes up for it with its solid acting and directing.In 1870, Civil War veteran Captain Jefferson Kidd (Tom Hanks) makes a living by travelling throughout various towns in Texas reading the newspapers to local residents at ten cents a head. After one particular evening of keeping a town informed, Kidd discovers an overturned wagon and a young blonde-haired, fair-skinned girl named Johanna (Helena Zengel) seemingly abandoned wearing Native American attire. Upon reporting Johanna to the local authorities, Kidd is told that it will be three months before someone will be able to return her to her surviving family located several miles south and despite his reluctance and her lack of cooperation, decides to take her there himself.I've been a fan of Westerns for as long as I can remember, with ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" being one of my all time favourite movies and the ""Red Dead Redemption"" games ranking among the best I've ever played. I suppose it's just the simplicity of these stories mixed with gunslinging action that attracts me to this genre so much. A film like ""News of the World"" certainly isn't groundbreaking in any of these regards, but it successfully gets the job done in the most satisfying way possible. On the surface, the film is littered with predictable Western tropes like shootouts with bandits, the inhospitable hot climate, and the aftermath of the American Civil War still fresh in the minds of many people. Yet, in spite of all of this, the film managed to rise above most of it thanks to a talented lead actor taking the reins and an equally talented director guiding us through the whole experience. If it were any other pairing, a film like this may not have worked at all, likely sinking without a trace among others of this genre, but instead we have an entertaining Western that engages the audience from start to finish in the face of obvious cliches.Under Paul Greengrass's direction, the film moves along at a surprisingly slower pace than one would expect of a Western like this. Normally that would be frustrating but I felt that it allowed the audience to properly take in and appreciate the atmosphere of the old American West in all its arid glory. The people encountered and the locations camped at became more involving as a result and weren't simply glanced over in favour of moving the story along. Additionally, his choices in cinematography showcase how vast and dangerous the land our two characters must traverse to reach where they are going. Since the film is set in Texas, one of the largest American states by sheer size, it is a firm reminder of how much ground must be covered if the two of them wish to arrive in one piece. All of this made me think of the old saying that it is the journey itself and not the destination that is most important in any adventure and I believe that can definitely be applied here.As to be expected, Tom Hanks does a great job in the lead role, bringing the usual affable everyman qualities we are accustomed to seeing in virtually all of his performances. Interestingly, this is the first Western character Hanks has played in his career (unless you count Woody from the Toy Story films) and yet he approaches the role so naturally that it may as well be one of many. However, it is young newcomer Helena Zengel who stands out the most as Johanna. I enjoyed her interactions with Hanks's character, even though she barely understands any English, and watching them grow closer as an almost father/daughter pairing felt rewarding as the film progressed. This is also Zengel's first English language film and hopefully it will open the door for her to other similar projects in the near future.In conclusion, while this film doesn't really do anything new, it still felt fresh as ever mainly due to its main star and director. Francis Ford Coppola once said that there aren't any new stories to tell anymore and that our best bet would be to tell one in our own unique way and this film does indeed feel told in a way any Western fan can enjoy and forgive most of its shortcomings. Other films out there could definitely benefit from that approach, though one can only hope their filmmakers will actually follow suit.I rate it 8/10",News of the World

It is a tried and true story, one we've all seen or read before in different scenarios throughout the years. However, this film approaches a familiar story against a refreshing new backdrop ... this coupled with the always excellent acting from Tom Hanks, makes it a movie worth watching.Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd (Hanks), a former Confederate soldier, makes a living by traveling from town to town bearing and reading the ""news of the world"" from his newspapers to those who are willing to pay for it. On the road one day, he chances upon a young girl named Johanna, who is alone in the world. He befriends her and takes it upon himself, despite the dangers it brings to him and her, to conduct her safely to her nearest living relative where the law states she belongs. As the two unlikely's travel together, they form a bond ... one that will be put to test time and again leading to the film's final dilemma and conclusion.As mentioned before, it is a familiar story, yet this effort was delivered with a lot of heart. The cinematography was excellent with some amazing landscapes and panoramas, the acting top notch, the character development and chemistry was a slow build, but perfect, and the soundtrack fitting. I was drawn in pretty much from the start and the film kept me engaged until the very end.I really enjoyed this movie and give it a recommend. It isn't high on the re-watchability scale, but it certainly should be watched and appreciated for what it is - expert acting and filmmaking.

79,ronakkotian,Striking visuals with an ordinary and predictable story,6,11 February 2021,"It's nice to see Paul Greengrass reunite with Tom Hanks again after Captain Phillips but this film isn't as good or as memorable as their first collaboration.News of the World follows Civil War veteran Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd who travels town to town reading the news to its residents. Along the way he finds a young girl and agrees to take her to her aunt and uncle.This is a story that we've seen being played out countless times in the past. It is very predictable and goes down paths that are very familiar. What I really did like about the film was its presentation. This film is a western and Paul Greengrass did a terrific job conveying that to us. The production design, costumes and cinematography make this one of Greengrass's most visually striking films. The lighting too was utilised well which is one of my favourite parts of westerns. The score was also beautiful and brought a lot of atmosphere to the film's world. In terms of its technical aspects, News of the World does a spectacular job creating the western world and breathing life into it. There is one particular shootout scene which has its tense moments but this is one of Greengrass's more sombre and slower films so the lack of action may leave some people restless.The heart and soul of the film really come from the two lead performances. Tom Hanks is excellent as usual. The energy and charisma he brings to the character when he's reading the news makes him so likeable and even the subtleties he brings to his performance paves the way for the film's more emotional moments that make you truly care about him. Helena Zengel does deliver a surprisingly great performance. At first I wasn't so sure but later on she improved and made me feel more attached to her. I'm hoping to see her in more films in the future.All in all, News of the World is a decent western. Apart from its beautiful visuals and the performances, there isn't much else that makes this film stand out. It's another ordinary tale told well but I don't see myself remembering it or wanting to watch it again.",News of the World
80,trinaboice,Slow and predictable but still an enjoyable journey,8,8 January 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
There were soooo many movies that came out around Christmas that I just recently found time to watch the newest Tom Hanks film. In case you missed it too, here's the scoop! Universal Pictures bought rights to this melancholy western movie after its original screenplay owner, 20th Century Fox, was closed by the Walt Disney Company. It utilizes the two-time Academy Award-winning actor Tom Hanks to tell the story of Civil War veteran Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, based on the novel by Paulette Jiles' 2016 novel. She actually received the National Book Award nomination for fiction the same year. Before TV news anchors, traveling newsreaders would relay the day's headlines across the country ""for anyone with 10 cents and the time to hear it."" The touching movie is directed by Paul Greengrass who also co-wrote the film with Luke Davies.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
You see a dead, black man hang from a tree.
Some unnecessary profanity that would have made the movie more family-friendly without
You see a field with a bunch of dead animals.

SecretsTHINGS I LIKED:
Tom Hanks is an American icon in the film industry. I don't know a single person who doesn't recognize his brilliance. He's such a talented and versatile actor. What's amazing is that this is his very first Western film! Well, that's if you don't count the Sherrif he voices in the Toy Story franchise. He's a master at playing flawed, yet honorable characters.
It's a Western movie, but a much different take on one.
Director Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks worked together in the powerful movie Captain Phillips.
This is the English language debut film for Helena Zengel. She became the youngest to ever win the ""Best Performance by an Actress In a Leading Role"" at the German Film Awards in 2019 for her role in System Crasher. She was born and raised in Berlin and began her career at the ripe old age of five in a music video. movies She has that unique spark of a true star and we're sure to see a lot more of her after this performance. After one look at her audition, director Greengrass said it was the easiest decision he made in the film. It's the first time he has made a movie with a child actor at the heart of it. She plays an orphaned girl who was raised by the Kiowa Indians. When she was interviewed, she said she had never heard of Tom Hanks before. That's surprising because she has great father/daughter chemistry with her older acting buddy.
Compelling cinematography by Dariusz Wolski.
James Newton Howard's score is a perfect fit for this Western yarn.
Believable special effects and scenarios.
The silence is even more powerful than the spoken words.
The film features dangers both by humans and nature.
There is an intriguing social commentary on how we get our news today, the importance of how it's presented, and how eager we are for it.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's definitely a slow burn. I didn't feel truly engaged until about an hour into the movie.
I've talked with several people who were bored while watching the movie. I definitely enjoyed it more than they did.
It has less action and tension we've ever seen from a Paul Greengrass movie. We're used to having our hearts beat out of our chest with his movies like the Jason Bourne franchise, Green Zone, United 93, etc. so this film felt very restrained.
Not much humor to balance out the drama.
There are some odd CGI moments.
It's very predictable, but the journey was still enjoyable.You can watch the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel! Subscribe!",News of the World

Add a few bad choices in there and this movie is a stinker.",News of the World
82,PyroSikTh,A Light and Entertaining Road Western,7,14 February 2021,"News of the World follows wild west Newsman Captain Kidd as he travels from town to town, delivering the news to remote townsfolk across southern Texas. After one particular reading, he stumbles across a ransacked wagon carrying a young orphaned girl, and finds himself put in charge of getting her to her aunt and uncle. This is fundamentally a road movie, as we follow Kidd and Johanna on their journey from town to town, meeting an eclectic array of locals, and finding themselves in all kinds of trouble.This is a fairly light movie though. There's nothing here to particularly challenge the viewer. There's no big twist, no deep subtext to decipher, nothing particularly gritty worth sticking your teeth into. It has its emotional moments, but they're reigned in to keep focus on the relationship between Kidd and Johanna, and there's moments of tension and suspense, but ultimately nothing particularly bad ends up happening to either character (or at least nothing too bad after the movie starts). Johanna's upbringing is one full of tragedy, losing her blood family in a brutal attack on their homestead, which she later visits to see looted and full of blood smeared over the walls. She was then taken in by Kiowa natives, learned their language and drenched in their culture, but she was left as the only survivor of her tribe after an attack by the local colonialists. Kidd on the other hand hasn't seen his wife in over five years, since he left for the war and then started travelling to read the news. He left his life behind and refuses to return for fear of what he might find there, but just like Johanna goes back to her family's homestead, Kidd too goes back to San Antonio to put his demons to rest.The closest this movie gets to an underlying theme and message is that of the nature of stories, and the news in particular. Kidd makes it his life's work to ensure the hard working men and women of America know what's going on in the world around them, even if doesn't directly affect them. He calms down a rowdy rabble upon hearing of president Ulysses S. Grant's intentions to grant black people more rights and freedoms, but also incites a rebellion in a closed-off town ruled by an outlaw dictator by telling them the story of a group of miners who survived a deadly fire against all odds. News of the World gives us a hero in a Western who changes the world with his words and his stories rather than with gunsAlthough to be sure he certainly meets troubles that can't be won with words alone, resulting in the movie's few but suspenseful action sequences. A group of ex-soldiers looking to kidnap Johanna besiege Kidd on a hilltop, forcing him to think outside the box to fend them off, while his incited revolt lands him in big trouble with the outlaw leader. While these action setpieces are draped in suspense and tension, the ultimate outcome is never too shocking or plot-changing. Kidd and Johanna manage to get out of both scuffles largely unfazed, which could lead to some complaints of predictability or plot armour, but hey, it's a light and entertaining movie. They don't all need to be narratively challenging.Possibly my favourite aspect of this movie though was the representation of Native Americans. While they're portrayed with respect throughout, Greengrass goes further by depicting them as almost otherworldly, bathed in dust or fog, always traveling from one place to another. They're neither aggressive nor naively innocent, but just people doing their best to survive, at one with nature and the spirits around them. The film also avoids the temptation to return Johanna to a Native American tribe, acknowledging that she's just as much a Native as she is a Colonialist. She's a girl without a family and without a home, and she no longer fits in with either side. But it certainly flirts with who she'll eventually settle with. As a light and unchallenging movie the answer is ultimately obvious, but that doesn't stop it from daggling the possibilities in front of both us and Captain Kidd.The acting from Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel is fantastic, offering up so much in their performances without words. Every glance and shift in body language says a thousand words between them, overcoming the multiple layers of language and culture barriers between them. As much as this movie is about the power of truth and stories, it's also about the relationship between these two characters, and a large portion of the film's dramatic entertainment comes from seeing that adoration between them flourish.Lastly the film looks gorgeous. It has some shaky moments of CGI from time-to-time, but nothing too distracting. However the cinematography offers some breathtaking shots of the local scenery, bathed in ethereal lighting. Particular highlights include dusklit campfires, silhouettes in the dust storm, and Johanna calling out to a travelling tribe of Natives across a raging river in the dead of night. But what the film does really well is creates an immersive atmosphere of 1870s Texas. You're transported back to the western frontier and told to just live in it and its people. It gave me the same feeling playing Red Dead Redemption gave me, just lifted from my 2021 lifestyle and planted fully in another time entirely. It wasn't too gritty and miserable, but it also wasn't too afraid of the darker elements of that life to gloss over them entirely. The danger on the road, or out in uncharted territory, the relative safety of the larger towns, the pervasive lawlessness, but full of people just living their lives.News of the World is not a remarkable movie by any means. It's movie that will be largely forgotten about as time goes on. It's a safe, light movie made for pure, sentimental entertainment. There's nothing here to challenge the viewer, nor does it attempt anything particularly new. It's pure escapism, watching Tom Hanks be his usual friendly, selfless character delivering news, and bonding with an orphaned girl along the way. It's just a solid good time free of baggage. I give it an enjoyable 7/10.",News of the World
83,jordan2240,Not Hank's best,5,23 April 2021,"I have no doubt a lot of work went into creating this film, and props to the child actor for doing a nice job, but the movie was absolutely ruined for me early on when Hanks' continually speaks to her character in English, a language she has no knowledge of, and she somehow responds. And at some point, he somehow starts speaking her language, a language he had no way of knowing. Sure, I could understand if he was just talking to her like he did the ball in 'Castaway', with no expectation that she understood what he was saying, but that's not how this played out.In addition to that, I simply never felt any sort of empathy or sympathy for the little girl nor for Hanks' character, and some of the scenes had me rolling my eyes because they were so cliché.

86,sweidman-28016,Good But Left Wanting More,7,7 January 2021,"""I'm here tonight to bring the news from across the great world of ours.""A Civil War veteran agrees to deliver a girl, taken by the Kiowa people years ago, to her aunt and uncle, against her will. They travel hundreds of miles and face grave dangers as they search for a place that either can call home. Paul Greengrass is an outstanding director and that's something everyone can agree on. His take on a western felt like a promising entry after the success of Captain Phillips. Though News of the World doesn't deliver as much as we wanted it to, it's still a good movie. Greengrass collaborated with Luke Davies (writer of Lion and Beautiful Boy) to adapt the novel. There isn't much that we haven't seen before. Most of the time I could tell what was to come. Even with some of the dialogue I could tell where it would go. I think that's where most of my issues come from. I wanted something more but I got a basic western. Most everyone likes the movie but the reviews are extremely high for what it is.Tom Hanks gives another good performance. He and Greengrass definitely have a shared connection. But the real star is Helena Zengel. I felt most connected with her character even with the language barrier and how little information we have on her. The decision to have subtitles with her kind of bugged me. Without the subtitles I feel a better emotion could've been created. For example, there's a scene with her crying out. It's sad what's happening but I think it would've been greater if we didn't know what those exact words were. We understand what she's saying but knowing more made the impact less.Greengrass definitely had an eye for what he wanted this to look like. The production design feels like a classic western as we from town to town. The same goes for the costumes. The cinematography looks pretty good. I had some issues with a few scenes having the blue filter to make it look darker and random zoom-in/zoom-outs that felt out of place. The score gets you in the mood for what's to come. It really just does what you'd expect it to. I like News of the World but it felt like a letdown in the end. Like I said, everything is too predictable and cliche for any surprises with the story or characters and the stakes never seemed high. Maybe this is the type of movie you're looking for. Some people are coming out having a good time. I just needed more.",News of the World

88,ethanbresnett,A good watch,7,8 April 2021,"I really enjoyed watching News of the World. It has a great feel to it, from the costumes to the fantastic vistas and sets to the score, it just looks and feels like a treat.Obviously you can't go wrong with Tom Hanks. He just has so much gravitas, charm, and you instantly feel a connection to any character he is playing. Surprisingly he is upstaged by the incredibly talented Helena Zengel who steals the show. Her performance, considering it was one of little dialogue, was outstanding and was so captivating. The relationship between her and Hanks felt so real. You could feel the growing connection and were rooting for them from start to finish.I would have scored this film higher but I thought the plot was a bit of let down. I enjoyed the underlying premise, but felt that it could have done a lot more. There was lots of great stuff exploring the character of Captain Kidd and developing the relationship between the two, but I feel like the film could have been longer and spent a bit more time diving into this. As a result we would have got a much more satisfying emotional payout come the end of the film.On the whole though this is a solid watch as you'd expect from a Hanks film. It has a great western feel with an epic scale, while also managing to develop a very watchable and engaging partnership with our two protagonists.",News of the World

Here really shows his paternal side as his life takes a turn when he comes into contact with a lost 10-year-old Kiowa girl, and the two embark on a long journey across Texas facing many dangers along the way. But Hanks isn't the only one to take a turn because behind the camera Greengrass has stepped out of his comfort zone with this, he doesn't usually give us a slow yet an incredibly absorbing drama, in fact quite the opposite he usually gives us tense thrillers, while this may be a step out for him. It's also a step in for him as he seems very much at home, thus making News of the World a success. Granted it does suffer from narrative issues down the road but you can always rely on Hanks pulling out a trick up his sleeve yet again he's an absolute joy to watch and when the action slams into place both Hanks and Greengrass crank up the mayhem.

Director: Paul Greengrass
Starring: Tom Hanks, Helena Zengal etc
Overall rating 78/100News of the world is about a civil war veteran called Kyle Kidd (Tom Hanks) who agrees to a deliver a girl called Johanna (Helena Zengel) taken by the kiowa people many years before, to her aunt and uncle,against her will. They travel hundreds of miles and face grave dangers as they both search for a place that either can call home. At first when I watched News of the world especially in the first half my review was going to be negative, but the luckily the movie just got better and better, further cementing Tom Hanks as an acting legend, so let's get started.My first few positives would be the amazing cinematography, the performances and likeable main character, as well as a good set up for character development. The movie looked absolutely beautiful, wherever News of the world was shot it was stunning, the creative team took complete advantage of the beautiful set locations for effective action sequences. The performances in this movie were also absolutely fantastic. Tom Hanks further proves that he is still an absolutely fantastic actor and a true legend of Hollywood, he was charming had heaps of charisma and showed a lot of emotional range to his character that was conveyed authentically. But what a debut performance from Helena Zengel, her performance was powerful, charming and moving, it really shows when you can make a character who doesn't know English so compelling and interesting to watch so she should get a lot of work from this and fact that she is twelve years old is astounding to me. I also thought the actual character of Kyle Kidd was very likeable, he was charming, kind and a great father figure to Johanna as their relationship blossomed, he was also a very peaceful man who promoted equality and change which I thought was powerfully done. I also thought the set up for character development was great, having both characters needing to find themselves and where they truly belonged was an excellent theme and was set up very well in the first half.However, my first few negatives that were mostly in the first half of the movie would be the dull and rushed opening with a lack of establishing the story world, the predictable conflict and the lack of clear or effective conflict. The movie was extremely dull and it thrust you into a scene with the main character and it just felt like the movie expected you to know the story world and the significance of the main characters actions, the first half in general was fairly dull and the main plot point was just lazily set up for me. I also thought that the conflict that they attempted within the first half with Johanna and with other characters felt very predictable and lazy, and it just lacked believability. One of my biggest issues with the first half was the lack of clear or effective conflict, there was attempts to bring in conflict but I never believed that they were an actual threat to the characters, so this severely impacted the pacing for me and it was poorly structured. My final negative for the first half was the randomly introduced characters that lacked any form or relevance or impact to the movie. There was just tacked on characters that were in the movie for five minutes to a brief scene with the main characters then they weren't really in the movie anymore, if the movie wanted more characters which I think it should have they should have had more screen time and depth to them.Now lets move on to some more positives would be the impactful themes linked to racism, the character depth and chemistry between the actors, as well as effective building of tension. The movie tackled its deep themes on the racism towards Indians in the 19th century very well the movie balanced its conflict of the different views of the time very well and built towards spreading a message of peace which I loved and it was very moving and powerful to me. I also thought that the character depth in the movie was excellent, not only was their great depth to its themes on racism but the main character had tremendous depth to him that really was very emotional, him losing his wife and never being able to have kids and him feeling guilty and responsible for what happened added tremendous depth to his character and I connected with more and more as the movie went on, and the fact that he got to experience loving and looking after a child with Johanna was excellent, the development to their relationship was fantastic and the chemistry between Tom and Helena was fantastic, their father/daughter relationship felt authentic and beautiful, the movie also effectively built tension, the action scenes and the more focused conflict on racism and changing parts of society built the tension very well making the movie slowly get better and better.My final few positives would be the fantastic script, the emotional weight and the emotional and powerful ending. The movie for the most part had a fantastic script, the dialogue was fantastic and powerful, and the script as a whole was well structured, fantastically written and conveyed its themes with depth and emotion. Expanding on my previous comment the movie had a lot of emotional weight, Learning more about Tom Hank's character you really felt emotionally connected to the movie and his character, there was a lot of personnel and deep scenes with his character that were very moving. My final point is the powerful and emotional ending, the movie made an excellent choice with Kyle taking on Johanna as his daughter, it was powerfully written logical and was very moving to watch.Overall, despite News of the world having a fairly poor first half with issues with its pacing and conflict for the characters, News of the world is moving, tense, powerfully acted and has a great message. Showing us that Tom Hanks has still got it and Helena Zengel is an actress to keep an eye on.",News of the World

He finds Johanna on the road and knows she was captured by and lived with the Kiowa Indians. She speaks no English. He takes her to the nearest Army Camp and is told the Indian Agent won't be back for quite a while and he can wait for the Agent or take her to her aunt and uncle himself and that's what he decides to do.

Like True Grit, News of the World is based upon a fine novel. Like True Grit, News of the World relies upon a stellar performance by a young actress, in True Grit, Kim Darby, here, Helena Zengel.This film, despite its languid pace, is gripping from end to end. We are reminded that most folks circa 1865-1870 could not read, and needed a smart fellow to read them the news.And that bias, prejudice, bigotry, and race hatred surely survived the end of the Civil War.The cultural aspect of the Kiowa nation is not fully fleshed out in the film, but it is here; the Kiowa were a Great Plains Nations, and ought to be forgotten among our great indigenous peoples .A wonderful film.",News of the World

I shouldn't have been cautious as he exhibits his talents yet again here in this tale of a good man trying to return a young girl to her roots, even though she has no interest in doing so or even knowing what they are. This is a fine film with the always, and I do mean always, dependable Mr. Hanks. There must be somebody somewhere that doesn't like him, but I cannot imagine why. His performance is flawless, though it's not the kind of role that brings awards much like his previous work with Greengrass, Captain Phillips, should have. This has its tense moments and it actions scenes, but much of it is quiet, subtle and touching. The young girl is played by a German actress, Helena Zengel, and she is terrific with never a false move. I grew up on westerns and they are rarely of interest to me anymore, but this is one of the ones that is.

While it doesn't sound too exciting, I decided to give it a shot, specially considering that the director Paul Greengrass and Hanks already have a successful collaboration in Captain Philips.At the 30 minute mark, all my optimism and hope have gone out the window. News of the World, is as average a film as they come. There is nothing to hate on but at the same time absolutely nothing to like either. The narrative is predictable at every step as it is afraid to take any risks and instead opts in for the cliches.If like me, you are expecting an emotional tale of companionship, that doesn't happen either as there is simply no chemistry between Hanks and the young girl.

On the one hand we have Johanna, an innocent swept up in the events around her over which she has little control. And on the other we have Geoffrey, a man who has lost everything who finds a sense of purpose in Johanna's plight.In this story we see that the United States wasn't created at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, but in the savage and unrelenting destruction of different cultures and identities. The unforgiving process of rebirth and renew that the characters are travelling a straight path through.The plot follows this transition from the old European (German speaking) settlers through the post-war struggle not only in their search for a new sense of place, but in the new United States journey on its path to a new identity.This film is unrelenting in its depiction of the harsh realities of life in that time. Death, murder, exploitation and suffering. But among its darkest moment there is hope and a belief that there is a promised land.As well told as this story is it does suffer from a rather pedestrian pace.

On his route of numerous locations, he comes across a young German-born girl who has been living under the care of native Americans who have been slaughtered. He takes it upon himself as her new guardian to escort her across the countryside to safety in the hope of finding her a new home. Along the way, they achieve an expected bond as two lonely souls in a treacherous world of danger of adversity.Hanks is great as always, as the film is told from his weary, anguished eyes. But newcomer Helena Zengel steals the film from right underneath him with a mesmerizing performance as a young girl traumatized by personal tragedy, untrusting of the world around her and just beginning to learn her communication. Together, they bring this rugged journey to life. Director Paul Greengrass makes a vivid recreation of 19th century American wilderness, a land of difficult terrain and occasionally bitter climate. Through it all, it becomes a battle for survival for both the old man and the child he is protecting.

138,bastille-852-731547,"Soulful, lyrical, powerful Western",8,28 December 2020,"I'm a big fan of Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks, so I was looking forward to this 19th-century Western. Based on the book of the same name, it tells the story of a Civil War veteran, Capt. Kidd (Hanks) who now serves as a news-teller in Texas. He must bring a young girl, Johanna, to her aunt and uncle. The film is skillfully well-made and leisurely paced, as its tone feels almost lyrical. Its western setting is depicted as harsh and realistic, but still unique and powerful. The film's cinematography of 19th-century north Texas is absolutely impeccable. After ""Nomadland,"" it's the best cinematography of the year. From gorgeous wide shots of prairies and canyons and mountains to detailed sets of important towns at the time such as Wichita Falls, the shots look sublime throughout the film.While the film's pacing is slow, it never feels too slow by any means. In fact, such leisurely pacing feels appropriate to the more lyrical tone of the film--almost like a more gritty version of a ballad. Even though the film is obviously very tonally different from Greengrass' other films, such as the original Bourne trilogy and ""Captain Phillips,"" Greengrass is still able to build up lots of suspense at appropriate times over the course of the film--such as a scene when Capt. Kidd and Johanna must out-maneuver a gang of outlaws, a bumpy and dangerous stagecoach ride, and a desert storm. The emotional core between Kidd and Johanna is very well done, and the performances are very strong. Hanks does a great job showing a range of both charisma and grit in the role, and the young actress who plays Johanna is superb. My only criticism of the film was that the film could have developed Kidd and Johanna better as characters, although the limited dialogue between the two of them (as Johanna does not speak English) may be one of the reasons why character development within the scenes they are both together in can sometimes be a bit limited. Otherwise, this is a gritty yet gorgeous Western made with passion and talent. Gladly recommended. 8/10",News of the World

You can see the ending coming from a mile off. I just don't know if this was a story that needed to be told.The script was pretty beige to me too. It wasn't gripping. It wasn't really passionate either. It just felt like a movie script from a western from 2006 that we have all forgot and you may have rented from blockbuster once but you don't really remember it. It just wasn't fresh.I do think the set pieces were pretty good. They looked really nice and in turn provided some lovely shots. I didn't love the colour of this film. It was very muted. I get that it was a western but it just looked really grey and washed out. Maybe this was a choice i just didn't love it.The acting was pretty good especially from the two leads. Some of the other acting was a bit over the top and out of place. Some of the antagonists seemed like pantomime villains and i also think when they were on screen the script also sagged. It turned into Saturday mourning cartoons a little bit.I do think some of the action scenes were engaging however.

145,theredsky,News of the World Review,6,16 January 2021,"An interesting story bogged down by repetitiveness. Tom Hanks is still great as always. He always puts a lot into each of his roles that makes each of his characters stand out from one another with this one being a reluctant father figure who chooses to help those in need. The direction by Paul Greengrass is great. I haven't seen much of his work but I'm interested in seeing what else he can do besides this and Captain Philips. Both of which Tom Hanks starred in. Helena Zengel is good at points and weak in others so I can't praise her performance nor can I bash it. This has an interesting concept of a Civil War Captain who travels from town to town reading the news to people stepping outside of his comfort zone to help someone in need. I think this film did a great job at showing the unrest in 1880s Texas. The film shows the tension between the people of Texas and the Union forces stationed there. It also does a good job at making you feel for some of the characters especially Hanks' character. The cinematography is also great. Greengrass does an incredible job at showing off these great landscapes with each shot feeling a little more different than the last. My big issue with this film comes down to its repetitiveness, pacing, and slow descent into boredom. There is a cool action set piece at the beginning but after that point, the film starts to throw similar situations of peril one after the other. After a while, you start to say to yourself ""Haven't we already seen this before?"" It doesn't help that the pacing is awful at times with some scenes going on for way to long while others are cut way too short like the scene where a town is basically controlled by outlaws. We spend so little time there and it was a very interesting scenario that is cut away from. I also take issue with the resolution of the film being not great. Without spoiling the film, we see what happens and you think that that's it but then the movie goes on for another 25-30 minutes and it's really boring aside from one 3 minute long scene with Hanks. It should have ended where I thought it was gonna end. If you like Tom Hanks or Western movies then you might get something out of this but you can wait until it comes out on DVD, Blu-Ray, or rental to watch it.",News of the World
146,pritol,"Touching tale about loss and ""Home"" in the West...",7,14 September 2021,"First things first, 13yr old Helena Zengel who plays Johanna, is absolutely outstanding! Her performance alongside a wonderful, as always, Tom Hanks is simply stunning, in some scenes she almost overshadows him.That aside, this is a slow burn tail of a retired Captain Kidd who travels around the old west reading the news from town to town. His usual routine is completely thrown though when he discovers a young girl (pale skin, blonde hair) who had obviously been abducted and then raised by Native Indians, but is now abandoned. This is young Johanna.The story follows them as they try and make their way across country to some people who could be Johannas relatives. Their relationship is sweet to watch, and Hanks portrays a paternal caring that seems to come so naturally in many of the roles he plays. Zengel plays a young girl unsure of herself, and split between two cultures so very well. They both learn from each other as the journey goes on.Ultimately the story is about each of them suffering loss, with the other actually filling the hole that their loss creates. Johanna has no parents, Kidd has no family. They have both lost something, but together they find their ""home"".Beautifully shot, with a slow elegant pace, it doesn't fall prey to any of the Wild West stereotypes, but the danger they encounter along the way is all to believable.Sometimes it was almost a little too slow, and a lot of the nights scenes were so dark it was hard to see... but a very enjoyable movie nevertheless.

148,jaredpahl,"Extra, Extra... Superior Talent Turns in Pedestrian Effort",5,7 January 2021,"It wasn't unreasonable for me to be properly excited for News of the World. The newest Hollywood western, and the first new theatrical release in about five months that felt worth taking a trip to the cinema to see, News of the World had two big talents on board: star Tom Hanks and director Paul Greengrass. If there were anyone to put a little blind faith in, it would be two men behind some of the great films of the last three decades. The Greengrass-Hanks pairing, so fruitful in Captain Phillips, is, however, pretty barren in their second outing. News of the World is a considerable disappointment from these two great artists.Based on the novel by Paulette Jiles, News of the World is simplistic to a fault. Tom Hanks is Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, a Civil War veteran who currently makes a living reading newspapers to busy townspeople in a sort of theatrical storytime across the country. Kidd stumbles one day upon an orphaned German girl named Johanna (Helena Zengel). Johanna was taken in by Kiowa Indians as a youngin' and has completely assimilated to their ways. Kidd figures out that she needs to be transported to her surviving German relatives, and Kidd... takes her there. That's the story for ya. Cross country road trips are not new to the Western genre, but Jiles' story strikes me as unusually thin. The attempts to create tension along the way are woeful. At two separate points along the trail, two separate groups of men show up out of nowhere just to announce to Kidd, in so many words, that they will be the bad guys for the next bit. Obviously, these characters aren't the important ones. Kidd and Johanna are.Their relationship is the centerpiece, and I can't really fault it. Hanks, the ever-reliable professional, rolls up his sleeves and says his lines with conviction as he always does. Zengel has an appropriate look; she isn't an annoying little cutie or smug growler as so many movie kids are these days, and she gives a good performance. I might even call it impressive. A scene or two or three of their growing bond hits home. These are the moments when you can see that director Greengrass kind of knows what he's doing.Elsewhere, things aren't as pretty. Greengrass' reputation is with visceral shaky cameras and documentary-style filmmaking. That's not what News of the World needs, and it's not exactly what the movie is. But Greengrass is no hack. He's also one of the preeminent masters of immediacy and excitement. Those qualities are what I miss. That is what is glaringly lacking with the approach he brings to News of the World. This isn't a United 93-esque docudrama, brimming with that sort of intensity. News of the World is a traditional story and it is shot like a traditional ""movie"". Just not as painterly or carefully composed as some. However, the only thing that directorial restraint creates is a limp, boring visual look. I think I would have respected a full lean into documentary authenticity here, or conversely, a full lean into John Ford-ian grandeur, but what we get instead is a hesitant attempt to be a little (but not too much) different from Greengrass' other works. For the most part, it's soft-focused, claustrophobic and close-up heavy, with only the occasional drone shot to highlight some dull Texan exteriors. Weaksauce. There's a way to envelope an audience in verisimilitude that Greengrass has perfected in his oeuvre (make it tight, immediate, suspenseful), and there's a way to do it on a giant canvas (look at the pictorial magnificence of something like Dances with Wolves). Greengrass and his cinematographer do neither with News of the World. You can't just point a camera at a beautiful landscape and have it transport the viewer there.Nothing grabs in News of the World. Tom Hanks is out there doing his thing, but is Captain Kidd really an interesting character? Is Hanks' performance anything special? No. The story is blah, the filmmaking is blah. It's very strange to see Paul Greengrass so lackadaisical. He seems uninterested in the material, and why shouldn't he be? The material is uninteresting. But still, there was something to salvage here. I mentioned that father-daughter relationship. It works on its own, in those individual scenes. But I trusted these filmmakers to come at it with a considered point of view. To put some kind of spin on it. To find something worthwhile in there. That didn't happen. What a shame.57/100",News of the World

Forcing each into their own groove that's hard to divorce.In its own way, it's harder on the characters than most westerns.

For this the Captain gets a dime a person and this is what he does from town to town.During one such trip he comes across a 10 year old girl Helena in an accident site. Since the authorities don't take responsibility, escorting this 10 year old helpless girl ( Helena Zengel) to her biological parents across the Texas plains in year 1870 becomes the self imposed mission of Captain Kidd ( Tom Hanks). This makes an absorbing film as both man and girl face and overcome natural ( sand storm) and man made ( gunfight with hoodlums ) obstacles. Both make it through the wild terrain through sheer grit and courage. He also carries her in his arms for some distance when she is overcome with fatigue, hunger and thirst.Director Paul Greengrass has done a commendable job in developing the narrative in a gripping way. Particularly impressive is the way he has handled Helena Zengel as he brings out her tension and anxiety realistically. Tom Hanks is brilliant as usual as Captain Kidd, where he fits in the character perfectly. The director is helped by the superb cinematography of Dariusz Wolski as he skilfully captures the inhospitable and ruthless terrain.",News of the World

When he's in a great movie you really connect with him and that natural warmth he has, but when he's in a very middling movie that same quality makes it almost more forgettable.

171,levybob,Six Stars for Tom Hanks and for the final Fifteen Minutes,6,16 September 2021,"I'm awarding Six Stars for Tom Hanks and for the film's final Fifteen Minutes. It's impossible not to appreciate Hanks' work; a melancholy Texan who travels the West reading newspapers to rural townsfolk who otherwise could not receive it. Hanks is terrific in this role; the sound of his voice and his overall manner just pitch perfect for this task.In one such town Hanks' character takes on the responsibility of escorting an orphaned child across Texas to relatives she has never met. Nor do they know she's been orphaned. The road is perilous. And we care about their safety. We like Hanks' news-reader. And his motives are pure.But then ..... The perils the two face seem repetitive. And the speed (or lack of) in dealing with each situation seems to drain the suspense out of the encounters. The film's middle is a tough go for one who wants to make it to the film's finale without dozing off. But somehow, I did.And about the finale. You might see it coming. I did. But still I found it rousing and spirited, and long after I forget the film's flabby mid-section, I'll remember its conclusion. As a good thing.",News of the World

Sound at all familiar? Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd is tasked with escorting a young girl to her sole surviving relatives. Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel produce excellent central performances but the story, such as it is, consists of a series of unrelated stock Western tropes (outlaws, remote township, the elements, Native Americans) with no purpose other than to develop a tenuous relationship between Kidd and Johanna, and that relationship is designed to enable Kidd to finally confront the death of his late wife many years previously.

174,filmtravel101,Good ole Western film - nice to see a solid story and great acting/directing,8,21 January 2021,"I am a big fan of both Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks yet I was a bit hesitant to watch a movie that is a western with such a simple story. However this film is something that has been lacking in Hollywood for a long time - a good solid script about a day in the life of the Western days without any agenda or spoiling of story telling days and Greengrass delivers. It has a little bit of everything action, heart felt moments and some of the history behind those days of strife and loss, and is beautifully shot in New Mexico even though it claims to be Texas. The new young actress Helena Zengel really does a magnificent job and is almost the star of the film with Tom Hanks as her guardian angel with lots of spectacular moments that remind me of some of older western films like Sergio Leone but with less pinache or loads of actions but a good heart felt film that is quite touching. If you are looking for a solid film that the entire family can watch this is one worth enjoying. A solid 8 and looking forward to more films with Helena.",News of the World
175,Waedliman,Worth a discovery,7,17 February 2021,"Sometimes I watch films just for the actors. Tom Hanks always delivers what he promises, now my interest was even greater because of young Helena Zengel and her Golden Globe nomination, although I don't really like westerns. As a result, this is not an outstanding film, but nevertheless the Hanks/Zengel team is worthwhile. Especially the still unknown German actress, who plays a girl of German descent who grew up among the Kiowa, will snatch up big roles, I assume. She manages to captivate the audience without many words. Whether this is actually due to her acting or simply to her charisma will be seen in later films. Nothing about her performance is exaggerated, there is no false pathos, no grand gestures. And Tom Hanks fits in very well, as he is known for his subtle art anyway. If you like rather quiet films that tell a quiet story, you will feel at home here.",News of the World
176,mgumsley,A western without direction,6,10 February 2021,"Tom Hanks has to be the most reliable actor in Hollywood, I haven't seen him give a bad performance ever. In this film, which could almost be labelled a road trip he is a seasoned old war veteran delivering news of the world to the pioneers of the west. These scenes are some of the most interesting in the film. But his travels round the state of Texas are mostly filled with events of the sort we are all too familiar with, in the western genre. You know the sort of thing,,, gun battles, double dealing, there is even a dust storm thrown in for good measure.
I don't think Hanks has ever been in a western before, not that it matters because the real richness of this story comes from the relationship between him and a homeless little girl. The film's opening sequence sets the scene: he inadvertently teams up with a homeless little girl who has witnessed a horrifying event. She is traumatized and sticks to him like glue. Being only ten years old, and him being a kind man of honour, they team up and find solace in each other's company. You can of course see the ending coming in this particular story and their relationship, interesting though it is, somehow never fizzes into vibrant life. The direction is slow paced, and the Texas scenery doesn't enhance the story as much as one would like. I found myself wondering what John Ford would have done with it. The pace would have been much quicker, and the dialogue would have made you bristle to listen to every word. It's not a bad film by any means, perhaps one of the main problems is that the little girl, Johannna, steals every scene from Hanks, and audiences are not used to that.
I could not help but compare it with True Grit, which had a similar theme and was filled with compelling characters and a story that bowled along at a quicker pace. What is likely, however, is that young Helena Eigel will become a star in her own right one day.",News of the World

178,Mike_Yike,One Of the More Realistic Westerns,7,25 June 2021,"The story is about a person who takes donations for the task of reading news papers to a small, rural audience in post Civil War Texas. The news reader, Capt. Kidd, is played by Tom Hanks, of course. Early in the film, as Kidd is traveling a trail from one town to another, he encounters a young girl, Johanna. He learns that she was held captive by Kiowa Indians since almost infancy. In fact, she knows no English, only Kiowa and traces of German. Kidd needs to take her to her aunt and uncle, which are all that is left of her kin. The trip is several hundred miles and will take weeks. While en route they encounter a number of dangerous episodes and assorted bad guys, which draws Kidd and the little girl closer together emotionally.The movie reminded me a bit of the more recent version of True Grit. One thing that has caught my attention in recent decades is how good child actors are. That wasn't the case up until maybe 1980. The little girl, played by Helena Zengel, was very good in her role. In fact, all of the performances were good. Anyway, the action is not steady. There are down periods. But that's okay. The motive is not another Die Hard, after all. I gave News of the World a solid 7. I could have gone 8 and not felt I was being too generous.",News of the World
179,MovieWarfare,Strong performance and visuals bring an familiar tale to life,7,31 January 2021,"A western cowboy era movie starring Tom Hanks. Cowboy type movies are sort of a dying genre nowadays but it was interesting to see legendary actor Tom Hanks star in one. Additionally, it was being directed by Paul Greengrass who directed some of the best Jason Bourne movies (and worst) and Captain Phillips which also starred Tom Hanks. The summary is ""Five years after the end of the Civil War, Capt. Jefferson Kyle Kidd (Tom Hanks) crosses paths with a 10-year-old girl (Helena Zengel) taken by the Kiowa people. Kidd agrees to escort the child across the harsh and unforgiving plains of Texas. However, the long journey soon turns into a fight for survival as the travelling companions encounter danger at every turn -- both human and natural"". So does this movie manage to achieve its goal or fall into the empty desert?The biggest praise has got to go to Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel performance of the main duos. Tom Hanks gives a subtle weariness and melancholy to his character while still containing compassion that feels genuine. Helena is a child actor so there was some scepticism from me but she delivers with some emotional and even heart-warming performances. The chemistry between the two actors is evident which is why it was such an enormous pleasure to watch both of them. Watching the relationship between these two characters develop from just strangers to that of a family is touching. The scenes where it is just both of them are some of the most enjoyable scenes in the movie and this is thanks to the strong performance from both of them. The supporting cast is really good as well and deliver an effective performance for their representative characters.The movie contains some great cinematography that makes the movie aesthetically striking and gorgeous visually. This is quite a feat considering that a majority of the movie is set in set in some empty fields but the cinematographer, Dariusz Wolski, pulls it off. It is also complemented by great set and costume design that looks authentic and pulls you into the era the movie is set in. The music score by James Newton Howard is also really strong and is effective in representing the scenes. There are some action scenes in the movie and they are very tense with no shaky cam that is seen from the Bourne movies. For the most part, it is a character-driven story but the action scenes are really good when they occur.However, the story is very predictable and even cliche. There is not a lot of originality in this movie and the story is pretty much a beat for a beat tale that has been told so many times before. You can probably guess what is going to happen for the majority of this movie. The heartwarming scenes while done effectively are also things that have been done in previous movies or games. You will see these scenes and feel like you seen them before. There are also some pacing issues with this movie as it can slow at times near the beginning and near the end. Some scenes didn't add much and could have been cut to improve the pacing.Overall, the movie may be very familiar but it is entertaining nonetheless. Thanks to the strong performances and the visually pleasing design of the movie, it is still able to keep you glued to watching it. Under all of its layer, there is a lovely drama that conveys a meaningful message which honestly might be the news the world needs right now.",News of the World

182,Beachbum2018,Hanks is undoubtedly a legend but he's not Eastwood or Hackman here!,6,15 February 2021,"Great acting by Tom Hanks, but to be honest the rest felt like a rehash of standard fare westerns.... good guy vs bad guys with guns, American indian content, a few broken wagons and abandoned log cabins, compulsory illiterate cowboys, some soldiers, strong coffee in open air camps, mud in the streets, early settlers heading west, wagon wheels falling off, shooting a horse to put it out of its misery, desert ride, etc, etc.... you've seen it all before right!
So why isn't it 2 stars, well Hanks is now at an age when he can legitimately carry off the irascible old, tired cowboy bit, except he's not a cowboy here just an ex-soldier, but you get the point. That said despite Hank's legendary status other stars like Eastwood and Hackman have portrayed more convincing western characters, so he needs more practice to perfect or create a totally new iconic character role if he's going to do this again, which I think he should!
Hank's also normally plays nice guy roles, maybe it's time he took a risk and played a really bad guy or likeable bad guy role, it won't diminish his reputation with the public, that's cast iron by now, but may shift him a bit in terms of breadth of character into famed territory of other Hollywood legends like Clint.... nothing to lose and everything to gain!

While this review is simple and may not be entirely helpful in helping you decide whether this film is worth seeing or not. I can honestly say it was great to watch and you should see it if you get the chance. Tom Hanks played a rugged Civil War veteran very well. His character is a man of just wanting to mind his own business. Helena Zengle plays this twice orphaned girl who has no home, but yet the bond between 'Captain' and 'Johanna' is delightful. Helena also did an incredible job with her acting as it depended more on her attitude in the roll than the actual speaking. Visually this film was pleasing. I enjoyed the vibrant colours, the camera angles, shots of the landscape, and the flow between scenes. The story was good. It didn't offer anything too intense. The adversity faced throughout the film was perfectly placed. Because of this, the fluidity of the film was perfect. It did not feel like two hours had gone by from start to finish.Overall:
A film I would watch again. The story flowed well enough that I didn't get bored. The acting amongst leads was harmonious. Lastly, the film was visually appealing.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'yes'.Enjoy the show!",News of the World

190,verna-a,Hanks deserves better than this unoriginal screenplay,6,29 August 2021,"I embark on watching a western wondering whether it will bring anything new, or just rehash all the worn-out cliches. The answer with ""News of the World"" is about 20:80. The newsreader occupation of the Tom Hanks character is new, but the ""travelling loner"" with the sad past has been done and re-done. The odd couple theme is not new, nor the storyline with them drawing closer and closer. The ending is predictable. What made me shrug my shoulders the most is the random and mindless malevolence of the baddies as they pursue the travellers and deservedly perish in the gunfire. To say this is unmotivated is putting it mildly. It's just an excuse for the obligatory gunfight. If only they had the courage to leave this out. The other material has more realism and pathos. I would really mark this film down if it wasn't for Tom Hanks, who carries it with the power of his performance. The girl is not bad I suppose - at least she is in no way cute or lovable, and that helps to keep the sentimentality to a low level. Special mention must go to the fat horses, which apparently can be ridden or driven day after day without ever needing to be fed!

194,blackoutH,News of America,6,11 February 2021,"There's no shortage of westerns coming from Hollywood, there have been good ones, bad ones and although a good western is welcomed this one it's kind of more of the same.I cannot bash anything from an acting standpoint, Tom Hanks delivers no matter what movie or show he is in, he is one of the greatest, and this time as his sidekick a potential young talent by the name of Helena Zengel.
The story follows Captain Kidd who's job is to read the news to the people, traveling from town to town to give everyone the latest, the original reporter let's say. But make no mistake, the name of the movie clearly states ""world"" but these are only American news, either local or federal, which is kind of strange but all right...Right from the start, given we are in the crazy wild west, Kidd stumbles upon an abandoned carriage and a child who doesn't speak a word of English left behind, he takes her with him with the goal of delivering her to her family, but as expected they bond during his journey and it doesn't take much to see where the story is going, and while I do always appreciate a narrative that shows us how bad the natives were treated in the Americas, it's as much important today as it was in the past, there are better ways to take on this topic, and I've seen some really good ones.This is kind of ""another Western"" with some predictable elements, it actually starts off strong but slowly loses its pace and becomes a bit boring with its development - and of curse the unnecessary CGI placed in specific scenes for no apparent reason.
You don't get too attached to the characters, I think that what saves the movie aside from Hank's performance is the cinematography and the amazing landscapes throughout.It's not a bad movie, but also not a memorable one as well, so you won't lose much if you give this one a pass, unless you are a die hard Hank's fan.",News of the World

199,severindringel,A well-told western that falls short of being great,7,13 February 2021,"Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks have followed up their 2013 box-office hit Captain Phillips with another collaboration. In News of the World, Hanks plays a captain for the seventh time in his career, this time in a wild western. In the aftermath of the Civil War, he is a war veteran in charge of bringing the news to the people. On his journey across Texas, he meets a left-behind orphan from the Kiowa tribe and makes it his mission to provide her with a safe living. In the process, the two build a special relationship.Tom Hanks is, as always, a banker in the lead role of Captain Jefferson Klyde Kidd. It is the down-to-earth and empathetic nature that his characters often have about them. Hanks gives them the final touch with his great charisma and warm-heartedness. Even though in this case there is nothing wrong with his performance, one has the feeling that Hanks only deliberately chooses such characters. It would be exciting to see him slip into other roles once again. In the end, one even has the feeling that he could have got that bit more out of the character Jefferson Klyde Kidd. Helena Zengel does a great job for her young age as the Indian girl Johanna. Again, the role is quite similar to the one in Systemcrasher, the film that brought Zengel international fame. She is taciturn and once she opens up, she is either quick-tempered or emotionally confused. The chemistry between the two characters is ultimately what makes the film. It works flawlessly and shines especially when they teach each other words in their native languages. They build a father-daughter relationship with each other that you buy over the full length.Basically, News of the World is a solid film that does justice to the Western genre. The plot contains much that we have already seen to excess, but gains its own appeal through the chemistry of the two leads and an exciting shootout scene towards the middle of the film. Greengrass must hope, however, that viewers are still with him at all up to that point. Because the first 30-40 minutes are extremely slow and drag on. Westerns are often built up rather leisurely, but here they have taken too much time with the build-up of tension. With the aforementioned shootout scene, the film acquires more depth, which is reflected in the dialogues between the protagonists, beautiful images of the desert landscape and a very smooth accompanying score. The ending gets under the skin a lot on the one hand, but is too predictable on the other. News of the World is generally not a film that goes for surprising twists. It's a rather semi-brutal western, with decent performances and good technical skills - but that's all it is.",News of the World

Somehow, Captain Kidd finds himself trying to return her to what surviving family she has, 400 miles away (across the plains of West Texas, a difficult and dangerous journey).I won't write anymore about the plot except to say that it is well done, and that it tells multiple stories well.I mentioned that this is reminiscent of a real life story - that of Cynthia Ann Parker, kidnapped and adopted by the Comanche in 1836. Cynthia Parker ended up choosing being Comanche over returning to the Parkers (a prominent Texas family). The character of Johanna in this film does an excellent job of illustrating the cultural no-man's land that capture and adoption created. If you are wondering why this novel was chosen rather than the story of Cynthia Ann Parker?One, the story of Cynthia Ann Parker has sort of already been done (although not realistically) - The Searchers starring John Wayne. Second, Cynthia Ann Parker chose to remain a Comanche, she didn't return to live in the world of Texans. Third, the people who searched for these children and to return them to their families were often not very reputable individuals.Kidnapping and adopting children was common among the Natives of North America, especially the plains tribes. It is possible that their life on horseback contributed to a low birthrate. Children adopted were raised just as if they had been born into the tribe, and some even rose to high status. An example is Quanah Parker (the last war chief of the Comanche) - the son of Cynthia Ann Parker.What most impressed me about this film was Helena Zengel's performance as a German child who was kidnapped and adopted by the Kiowa and then recovered 6 years later.",News of the World

212,JabezGill,"Not amazing, but a decent movie",6,3 April 2021,"Summary of my review in a sentence or two: The movie is a tad slow, very predictable - worth the watch but probably won't inspire a second or third viewing. This isn't a classic western that you want to watch any time it is on TV or buy to watch over and over against.-------------------------
This isn't going to be played endlessly on TV for the next 30-50+ years like some of your favorite Westerns - but it is a decent movie.Not a ton of action - I was hoping for, and expecting, a lot more than we got. The screenplay and story were a little underwhelming, too. It is very predictable and this story has been done a thousand times(Spoilers)
Good hearted man trying to make his way in the world - comes across a young girl in need of rescue - takes it upon himself to get her to where she needs to go - at first it is very difficult and they don't get along - but soon they start working together and caring for one another - he becomes a father figure and she becomes a daughter - then bad guys come and threaten the girl at every turn but the good guy prevails - they have a break through and grow closer - we/they learn about the pain from their pasts - then their journey ends and they part ways - the good hearted man leaves but then realizes they belong together and goes back for the girl - she is angry that he left her but quickly forgives him - tears and hugs - each other are all either of them have left - they leave together - time jump forward to see the happy life they are living together now ... there is laughter ... he acknowledges her as his daughter - happily ever after, the end.I skipped a few steps in the formula but you get the point. That is why I didn't rank the movie higher. The pacing was slow and the predictably was high.I also find it a tad annoying how - in the span of a two hour movie that covers several days (weeks?) that by the end we have a character conversing in a previously unknown language. Granted it isn't much - but Kidd seems to pick up and string together sentences in the Kiowa language pretty quick.Another point - the CGI parts of this movie were really bad and it had a few awkward edits that just seemed amateurish or ""made for the lifetime channel."" Which is surprising to see in a Tom Hanks movie (then again Greyhound didn't have great CGI either) it's noticeable but the scenes are short enough that it isn't too bad.Now.... Hurry up and make you third mini-series about WWII for HBO Hanks!",News of the World

on one of his journey met a young girl who lost her family and here the trip starts.
No spoiler to be told, yet Tom hanks and Johana were good. and this why Tom Hanks is one of the best actors ever, because he can bring anyone on board, their chemistry was beyond perfect. Helena Zengel reminds me of Jennifer Lawrence, Same eyes and same gestures So I believe a new star is rising.
The movie was so good so you wonder why this is not nominated for best adopted screenplay, Cinematography was great and deserved an oscar nomination and deserves an oscar I believe.
Music, Art direction and the mentality of the film were there, but not in a perfect way.

214,lhunt-9,Best Film of 2021,8,30 May 2021,"Of the films I have seen this year, News of the World is easily the best. The premise is interesting --- the protagonist (Hanks) makes his living from his literacy, obtaining newspapers and reading them to far-flung audiences assembled in a series of towns along his route in the post-Civil War South (mostly Texas). He is a military veteran, affording him the skills necessary to survive in the postwar landscape, which can be extremely dangerous at times. He is on a mission, reluctantly taken at first, to return a German-American girl to her surviving relatives after first her parents, and then her adoptive Kiowa parents, had been killed.While the Kiowa are treated sympathetically, opportunities were available, but missed, to tell the story from their perspective as well. They are literally presented as ghostly figures on the periphery of the landscape in all but one scene. I live in an area with a high population of indigenous people, and I guess I'm used to hearing our first people's points of view on most topics (I emphasize the plural --- it's not just one viewpoint), so the omission was noticeable.However, the film stands on its own as a great achievement, even if much more could have been done to tell the Kiowa story. Helena Zengel plays the twice-orphaned girl, and is convincing in portraying a confused and ambivalent approach to her ever-changing guardians. The film finishes by developing her character further, and in retrospect, that is actually what this film is about!",News of the World
215,theshanecarr,Safe State of the West,6,15 May 2021,"It's directed by Paul Greengrass so the question arises; which Paul Greengrass are we getting? Is it the urgent, intense, investigative Greengrass of the latter Bourne movies, and Green Zone, or is this the slower, more observant, character study of, say, Captain Phillips?I's the latter. Greengrass and Hanks are interested in showing us a man, fundamentally decent, but battered by his experience; by war, by life, and how he travels the American frontier just trying to get by.Hanks plays Captain Kidd, a former soldier who earns his living by travelling from town to far-off town and reading from newspapers both local and national about the goings-on elsewhere. The masses, illiterate and cut off by the vast distances of the American west, pay to hear him read aloud, and learn about the goings on in the world.Western movies are so inextricably bound up in the American myth, ""how the west was won"", that it would be difficult not to see this as an allegory for America even if we weren't being subtly pointed in that direction. We see how the populace can be riled up by unwelcome news about the Federal government, or how they can be inspired to band together through stories of overcoming adversity. The masses can be shaped by (fake) news, and they can be set free by the seeing the best in each other. It's not an especially complicated message, but it sure is a timely one.The lead role role is so fundamentally latter-day Hanks-ian, so of a piece with other recent roles of his such as the aforementioned Captain Phillips, or those in, say, Sully, and Bridge of Spies that it's hard not to grant some authorial voice to him as well as to Greengrass in the making of this movie. It's just a shame Hanks doesn't seem willing to imbue these characters with more complexity than that. They are good. They do the right thing. That is really all there is. Hanks' flirtation with the dark side, as in Road to Perdition, is behind him. There's a great appetite for these movies, and I'm not immune (far from it) to the charms of Hanks being the world's reassuring movie-dad but it does leave the story in a far more predictable place.Greengrass and Hanks show us Kidd travelling through a world near broken, and unable to face its past when he finds an abandoned child and makes it his mission to bring her home. You can absolutely guess where this is going, and you won't be wrong.That's the pleasure of a movie like this - you know exactly what it's doing, and you watch expert craftsmen take you there, sure in the knowledge that they won't drop the ball.And they don't. But ultimately it's all a little safe, a little too conventional to mark it out as something more than capable, efficient, well-made,But that's not to condemn this movie. The bright spots pulled me in. Hanks delivers a solid performance. Helena Zengel is a delight as the spirited child Kidd takes under his wing. It's gorgeous to look at; both the grandeur of the wide open spaces, and the flickering candlelight and shadows of the night time scenes.It's a film you would be delighted to come across one rainy Sunday afternoon, but which no one will ever claim as their favourite movie.",News of the World
216,Tron79,"Tough message, but Tom Hanks is great.",6,15 January 2021,"I did enjoy watching this film on Amazon Prime's early release because Tom Hanks was excellent. But it's hard to watch how horrible the people were depicted in the post Civil War Texas. You have a lynching. You have greedy capitalists who destroy the buffalo and abuse their workers. You have evil men at every turn down the road. You have a little girl who just wants to go back to her Indian kidnappers because she likes being an Indian. Several times, I felt like the best thing for her would be to grant her wish to return to them instead of subjecting her to the American settlers. The little girl describes how everything is connected in nature in a big circle of life, while Tom Hanks says that Americans just go in a straight line and look ahead. The movie infers that there is no time to appreciate nature for the settlers. One character even says that there is no time for stories. He needs to focus on working the fields.This is not a Clint Eastwood film like Unforgiven where I found myself rooting for the most evil man in the West to kill Little Bill. The film hints that Tom Hanks' character may not be a great guy, but I never saw proof of this. I just saw someone who did his duty during the war. This is more of a story of how horrid people of Texas treated each other and the native population. It shows the resentment of the townsfolk for the Northern soldiers and the Northern President after the war ended. It was interesting how the army took away the Texans' guns and only allowed them buck shot weapons. It's a story of how the natural resources were abused with an awful scene showing an endless field of skinned buffalos.Tom Hanks is very believable as an aging man just scraping out a simple living reading the news. I thought the film was shot with a gritty reality in mind. The gun fight scenes did remind me a bit of Unforgiven in the way that it's not like Hollywood depicts when it's real people fighting for their lives. It showed us a dangerous road and an unforgiving terrain. It was worth watching, but it's a very tough message to stomach even if that's the reality of those times.",News of the World

Here, he travels across a believably authentic setting of 1870's America to deliver a long-lost girl to her only surviving relatives: the trouble is, she was taken by Indians when her family was slaughtered and only speaks their language after spending years in their company. This, as you can imagine, creates some problems in communications along the way...Tom Hanks is great in his role as the child's sole protector, who has a murky past of his own... but what did you expect? He kinda has a well-earned reputation for top performances. The real revelation is playing the young lady, who despite hardly uttering a word in English says so much with expressions and gestures alone in an incredibly emotional tour-de-force. If she isn't nominated for an Oscar later this year, let's just say there better be some pretty strong competition.Don't go in expecting anything very gritty... aside from a couple of tense shootouts, this is strictly a tale of two aspiring outcasts who find each other and bond during a long journey in the Wild West.

The film is somewhat episodic as they experience difficulties on their trip. My big gripe is that the part of Texas they are traveling through looks nothing like this. Many films are made in New Mexico because of financial benefits that Texas doesn't provide. ""No Country for old Men"", ""Hell or High Water"", and this film all look great, but ""News of the World"" was supposed to be in North Texas down through Central East Texas. The Dallas area is rolling black soil grassland with numerous rivers and creeks surrounded by large woods. It's farmland famous for cotton production. It's not desert. The Eastern half of Texas is Wooded with streams. Before cotton, cattle, or oil the first major cash crop to new settlers was lumber. San Antonio is on the Eastern edge of the Hill country, where there are hills separated by valleys with rock bottom, clear running streams, the most scenic part of the state.

234,OlgaGorelik,"Formulaic, but wonderfully immersive",7,28 March 2021,"Texas. The Civil War ended not too long ago. Vitriol, eerily reminiscent of modern day, is everywhere. Union soldiers observing gatherings and patrolling roads are an unnerving presence, proven useless when actually needed. Tom Hanks is playing a reluctant hero - a role he perfected many times over. Here he is Captain Kidd, a former Confederate officer now making a living by traveling from town to town reading newspapers to the local folk. We don't learn until the end what it was that drove him onto that treacherous path. And it was good to have that intrigue. It would have been interesting if the film also looked into how a man of such decency and intelligence was able to lead Confederate soldiers for 4 years. How did he come to hold views so different from those he was living among?Captain Kidd's already dangerous travels get a lot more dangerous when he stumbles upon a 10 year old orphan girl named Johanna played by a fantastic young German actress Helena Zengel. Johanna was kidnapped by Kiowa Indians as a toddler and raised by them as one of their own. Her biological parents were killed. And now she was orphaned and kidnapped again by people who surely thought they were rescuing her. She is to be taken ""home"" to relatives she's never met. Except, there's no one to get her there for months. Captain Kidd quickly realizes that he has no choice - otherwise she simply won't survive.There's nothing particularly earth shattering about News of the World. It's a very well made road trip film, following a common formula - two damaged souls who don't speak the same language, figuratively and, in this case, literally, gradually becoming each other's saviors. But I couldn't take my eyes off the screen as I watched the pair battle dangerous people and elements. The camerawork created a wonderful sense of immersion. Whether it's a stunning visual of Indian families on the opposite side of the river walking along the cliff in the rain like phantoms or gorgeous, sunny, yet terrifying landscape the characters are riding through - the movie pulls you in and doesn't let go.",News of the World

Although nothing is particularly outright terrible about it, well except perhaps some of the script which is dull, and especially weak dialogue amongst some of the bad guys they encounter, it's all quite unengaging, boring, and falls flat. There is very little, besides the cinematography, that really grabs you an draws you into the film. Apparently the two main lead characters bond, but I'm not quite sure when and how, because director Paul Greengrass doesn't really want to let us in on it. There's very little chemistry between the two main protagonists that gives you reason to believe that they connect with each other deep down, and not much that really made me relate and connect to the characters and their situation either, meaning that as a result, I didn't care about them.

242,annahudak-70828,Great characters...and that's about it,6,6 August 2021,"Well, first off, Tom Hanks is the star of the movie. So, yeah, acting is pretty top-notch as you would expect. Everyone is quite good in their roles, especially Tom Hanks. Outside of that, the movie is kinda mixed, but one thing it does very well is character development. We start the film with the girl, Johanna only being able to speak Kiowa, and Captain Kidd (Hanks' character) trying to speak to her with German and English. Getting near the end they're speaking a mix of Kiowa, German, and English to each other as they are learning from each other. Heck, even outside of language they learn from each other, such as Johanna teaching Kidd to use money inside of bullets to kill the kidnappers. The strength of the characters and character development is really what the movie relies on, because everything else is kinda meh. I honestly don't remember anything from the score (and film scores are something I pay attention to), I thought a few scenes went on too long, namely, the shootout, and honestly, that whole scene just felt out of place in the movie. Anyway, this movie is good, but not great. Still recommend though. It just depends on how much you care about character development in movies. If you really care, you'll probably like this movie. If not, stay away, this film isn't for you. That's pretty much all this film brings to the table.",News of the World

244,rockinkettles-1,Good movie. Great chemistry.,9,2 January 2021,"I liked this movie a lot. It may be a bit slow in parts but also has some exciting moments. Tom Hanks plays a news man who comes across a young white girl who was kidnapped by Indians years earlier. They killed her family and she was raised to be an Indian. The girl speaks and sings occasionally in Indian language. She and Tom have great chemistry as they travel on a long road together in a wagon to find her aunt and uncle.
Along the way there is an exiting scene where they are being chased by 3 men who want the girl. Tom and the girl go hiding up in the rocks and have a shoot out with the men...I felt badly for the girl and she played the part so well. You want to see her make it safely to the end of the road trip after everything the poor kid has been through already. I predicted the ending but was glad it turned out the way it did because I found it to be so heartwarming. Definitely reccommended when you get the chance to see it. Tom is good as always. And ignore the reviews that called it boring and a waste of time. They probably have ADD and can't sit through a movie with a good story.",News of the World
245,jflizard,Predictable and boring,5,1 April 2021,"I started watching this movie with the feeling that I already knew how it was going to end and I didn't even had to see a trailer, only by reading the plot ... and there it was: after half an hour it was crystal clear how much of a predictable story this was. That itself is not the only reason I didn't liked the movie : the immense and vast shots of the wild, the epic soundtrack, everything looks so forced and already seen, the story itself is slow and the action parts seem again thrown into the story in a helpless attempt to wake us up. Overall this is not a bad movie, Tom Hanks performance is solid , everything is well shot, the sound is good, photography is good ... but they tried too hard to make a boring movie look good and epic, and that's where everything start falling apart. I can advise you to watch it with low expectations , and yes this may be a movie that will suit many , but not me.",News of the World
246,berndgeiling,Nothing new in the Western World,6,12 February 2021,"Maybe I was expecting too much from the 2nd collaboration of Greengrass and Hanks, hoping for some kind of reinvention of the Western Genre.
The result is worth watching, but no surprise. Hanks never disappoints, portraying the loneliness of his character almost with too much routine, and child actress Helena Zengel is very promising. But the collection of genre stereotypes here, the clichees of the villains, the shooting sequences, crossing a desert running out of water, the traumas of post civil war (with some references to the divided nation of today) really doesn't do an exceptional movie for me, but just an average one, giving me the feeling I had seen all of this a hundred times before.",News of the World

No real story, no real tension - Just Hanks and his little feral girl side kick wandering the Wild West having the odd cliche'd encounter with an antagonist or two.So surprised this a Greengrass film, carries none of his high tension traits. To give it some credit, the acting is good, Hanks is solid and the location and steps are good. Feels authentically late 1800's America. Also it does carry some good sentiment towards the end. But that simply doesn't make up for the first hour and half.Easiest way to summarise - If you've ever played the Red Dead Redemption, remember the really boring bit where you have to travel long distances with a slow horse to complete missions and it all feels unnecessary and pointless?

The current rating of 6.7 is generous. A rating of six is probably accurate.NOTW has a standard premise and the typical plot of protagonist trying to do good transporting a little girl to safety. First and foremost the movie's pacing is really slow (especially in the beginning) which is surprising in this attention deficit world we live in. There is a gunfight in the beginning that goes way too long. There is a nice little reveal in the fight but still it took too long to overcome this obstacle.I think in part what hurt this movie was the little girl couldn't speak English so it was hard to form a connection. There was no one antagonist but several of them I DID NOT find Tom Hanks believable in this role as a former military man - perhaps yes as a news reader. I felt the news reader aspect could have been improved.The plot tried to show the protagonist character as being complex and flawed with regard to his wife and not seeing her for five years but the whole subplot fell flat to me. The movie just struggles.The ending was really contrived and not at all believable.We came away from watching this saying holy crap this was nominated for best picture by The Academy?

258,Darvener,Movie with bad screenplay,2,27 August 2021,"Movie 'News of The World' is written by Paul Greengrass & Luke Davies and directed by Paul Greengrass with a Hollywood star in the main role Tom Hanks. This screenplay is based upon the novel by Paulette Jiles. This movie tells us a story about man Captain Kidd (Tom Hanks) who is traveling from city to city to read newspapers to busy people for ten cents. One day he sees an overturned and mugged waggon at which Captain Kidd finds a little girl who doesn't understand English and he will try to bring her home.This movie was published by Netflix.Movie will acquaint us with Captain Kid and a little girl slowly. Later the movie tells us what she likes, etc. Movie will show us it's screenplay deficiencies. Many of the logic errors are important for the story because if they do not make the logic error, the next parts of the story will be different. One of the many logic errors is that John Calley (Fred Hechinger) gave Captain Kidd a handgun Colt when they were in Texas. Give Colt in a country like this where around the corner it can save your life is stupidity to give any handgun. If the logic errors were not in the screenplay, the story would be better but the whole story collapses on these errors. The end was predictable and unnecessarily long. Movie on things like editing and VFX collapses too, it collapses more than the story with logic errors. When the movie was in the early evening they created an unrealistic blue filter to ""look"" as early evening. VFX looks like you will hire an amateur and he will make it in one month. It looks horrible.Acting, locations, camera, music and costume design looks perfect but this is only good in this movie.This movie was a disappointment.2/10

The young girl performed well in what must have been a difficult role.But--we've seen this movie before, and we've seen it from Tom Hanks. Consider the following:
1) A man suddenly thrust into single guardianhood (to coin a phrase)--""Sleepless in Seattle""
2) A man on a mission to bring an now-only child home--""Saving Private Ryan""
3) A man who ended up on the wrong side learns valuable life lessons--""A League of Their Own""
There are even non-Tom Hanks references. To wit: A man goes on a road trip with a nearly non-verbal fellow traveler--""Rain Man"", although I admit the girl's moments were timely, showed street smarts and a deeply-rooted survival instinct.
Further, even though Tom Hanks' character played a solid man, they still fall back on the ""dumb redneck Southerner"" stereotype so ingrained in lesser efforts with other characters (Not Mr. Hanks, the men of Erath County).

304,Steve_Holt_,"Not good enough, nor bad enough",6,24 April 2021,"The movie isnt good enough to be great, but not bad enough to be dismissed. It's an enjoyable movie, and worth a watch if you're in the mood, but not one that can be enthusiastically recommended.I kept expecting some sort of deeper level allegory to come forward as it got closer to the end, but when that didnt happen I thought I'd read some reviews and see if others missed something that I hadnt caught. Unfortunately, the more I read, the more it became apparent that no, I dont think I'd missed anything, the story is just not that deep. It's not a terrible story or anything, there just arent any extra levels that you need to dig for in order to get that umph at the end.One of the key faults to this movie is that it's not truly a western and it's not a completely contemporary story, either. A western is a story where the frontier is as much a character as any of the actors. It needs to be a story that can only happen in the west because of the way it impacts the characters. In News of the World the setting languishes somewhere in between. The characters dont act or portray an honest vision of the people who lived in that place and time. Instead they feel too much like people from some generic reality inserted into a landscape with horses and revolvers. If you were to take this story and retell it in medieval Europe, or feudal Japan, or any other era, other than costuming and sets, you wouldnt have to change anything. So, in short, the frontier only serves as a vehicle to drive the characters from plot point to plot point.An example of this is the people. EVERYONE acts exactly the same in EVERY interaction. The same monotone delivery, the same lifeless expression, the dead-behind-the-eyes look, it's all too much effort to say ""look how ruined these people are, instead of using variation and nuance in a character or two to convey that. These frontier characters end up all driving the same point, which is a contemporary view reflecting back on the past, instead of opening a window to a real time and place.I compare this movie to Hostiles, but way better than that horrid waste of time. Both had great lead actors, both were stories about traversing the west, both centered around Native/military tension, and both did an insufficient job of saying something truly meaningful (Hostiles being a miserable waste of opportunity).More could be said, but Im not trying to bag on the movie, just show why I didnt think it was great, and why nor do I consider it a real western. I want to be clear that I am not unfamiliar with the old west, it is pretty much all I do is study western characters and history. So I also dont want to ruin others fun; where I may hold too high a standard due to my familiarity, others may enjoy it for being a reasonable output for frontier history.All in all, good, not great, enjoy for what it is, and forgive it for what it isnt.",News of the World

Also there was too much cliché in how the story evolves and how people behave.Why nowadays, there is no Western movie unnecessarily hitting the apartheit topic?! In the first few minutes a dead black guy is found with a note saying it was because of racism.
Why was this important to the story? Why would this guy be killed but the girl kept alive?
Why would a black guy even travell there if it is dangerous?
Why was this guy ordered by the government to bring the girl somewhere?
Why did the girl didn't run away; after the ambush? at each possible occasion before or after?
Why is the girl trying to run away just in the night when the Captain Kidd would leave the next day?
Why, at the very same night, there were Indians passing by, a few hundreds meter away of a village, full of cattle, at the time when there were tensions between white and Indians, especially when there are valuables close by, ... like cattles?

(Story itself is a key motif, as a key to empathy.) An unusual diversity of viewpoints is modeled, from unredeemed racism, to traumatized victims of war and oppression, to the desperate efforts of Native Americans to preserve their traditional ways of life.I will leave aside Tom Hanks' penchant for starring in roles as a messianic hero cracking wise, except to say he does it well, always a little differently each time..Special mention for the young girl playing the other leading character in a very challenging role, and for the elaborate sets depicting the wild North Texas country during Reconstruction, a critical, rarely-portrayed period of US history with clear relevance for our era.",News of the World

They travel hundreds of miles and face grave dangers as they search for a place that either can call home. I was really excited to see again the combination between Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks and they did not disappoint me. This is not Captain Phillips level but this is a good film. Paulette Jiles focused on storytelling and character development more than action sequences. This journey should be developed step by step and they did it perfectly. The pace is some time off but most of the time story flows perfectly. Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel's performance is top-notch. Especially great permanence from the young actress.

But when there's a much better side of the same story, then what's the point?News of the World aka The Bad of Us is completely a rip-off of... *drums rollin* The Last of Us, who could've seen that one coming huh? But for real, this story isn't anything more than a rip-off of The Last of Us. I mean, this whole concept of story isn't anything special, but you can tell that the movie was trying to mimic The Last of Us and added a bit of Mandy (1952) just so that they won't get straight called out for plagiarism. And if someone says: ""The movie was based on a novel"", you know what, you're right kiddo. Except that novel was released in 2016. I'm not against it if you take an concept of rivarly for your movie, but at least try to make it a good movie. Unlike The Last of Us, this one ain't even good, boyo.Let's start with the acting. Helena Zengel was pretty alright with her role. I don't want to discourage her or anything, but I think she could've done a much better job. I think it might have been more of Paul Greengrass's fault but whatever. Tom Hanks was Tom Hanks and Tom Hanks as Tom Hanks is the same as Steven Seagal as Steven Seagal: uninteresting. Well, to be honest, Steven Seagal is much more interesting than Tom Hanks. I don't hate Tom Hanks, but I haven't seen him acting a character instead of himself since the early 2000s. There could've been a much more better actors for this role, but I think Tom Hanks did his job. When it comes to the other characters, well... Michael Angelo Covino did a pretty good job with his character. The other actors... did not so well with their characters.Now, the directing. I don't mean to say that Paul Greengrass is an untalented movie director who shouldn't ever try to make anything that involves good acting, good writing and good directing... but I'm saying that. I mean, sure, in Captain Phillips Barkhad Abdi was really good, but I think it's more likely that Barkhad Abdi is just a natural born actor. In Good Time he did a good job, even in Blade Runner 2049 he did a good job, so I believe that's it's more thank to him than Paul Greengrass. Paul Greengrass isn't untalented, I've seen parts of his Bourne movies and they seem actually pretty good movies, but his directing is the same as Steven Spielberg's: money-grubbin'. I don't see that there's any passion or style in the directing, it just feels like Paul Greengrass just wanted that paycheck.Cinematograpy is good. Only thing that I do like about in all of Paul Greengrass's movies, is how everything is mostly shot handheld. It's obviously a stylistic choice, which I do like, but I think it's more thanks to the cinematographer Barry Ackroyd, who shot The Hurt Locker.Music is alright. it's just alright. There's not much to say about it, to be honest. It's the most generic Hollywood violin score.Story, even though I criticized it for ripping off The Last of Us, is not the worst still. Some of the moments and dialogue are pretty well written, but mostly it's the most generic, bland, tasteless, uninteresting, boring story. There's nothing good about that, it makes the movie just more annoying to watch.Even though I criticized this movie a lot, there's still good things about it. Sadly, there were more good than bad: 4/10.",News of the World

About effects, I can say they are regular, shots are well done, but in the shooting between captain and the three men, you can see how a big stone falls, that croma was awful.Finally I considere the dialogues between captain and Johanna seem unimportant, captain talks too much and the girl seems to understand him really often, I mean they speak different languages, so I don't know why they're always understanding each other.",News of the World

355,joshuarenealvarez,News of the World (2020),7,1 February 2021,"News of the World is a western-drama co-written
and directed by Paul Greengrass whom is widely known
for his collaborations in the Bourne Trilogy starring
Matt Damon. News of the World was named one
of the top-ten best films of 2020 by the National Board
of Review and it's based on the 2016 novel of the same name by Paulette Jiles. Tom Hanks delivers another satisfying performance as a Civil War Veteran who reluctantly brings it upon himself to deliver a young girl to distant relatives whom she was separated from. I haven't seen a film with this particular actor in quite some time so it was refreshing and a pleasure to witness him onscreen especially in the western genre (which I have come to favor the most). Sharing the screen is Helena Zengel who truly shines in this film as a 10-year-old named Johanna Leonberger who is unable to speak the English-language. We observe her compelling performance through her facial expressions such as her piercing eyes, and her motions are what provide communication. Separating the barrier for Captain Kidd and the audience. Truth be told, this film is very predictable and formulaic as I was able to accurately determine how this film would come to a close.But the journey was worthwhile as we witness the growing bond between these individuals who have no place to
call home and we receive a very heartwarming conclusion to the storyline. I only wish their characters and their relationship would have been fleshed out in order to grow more of an emotional attachment to them. The plot is identical to Leon: The Professional where the main character becomes the protecter of a troubled youth.The cinematography by Dariusz Wolski was absolutely gorgeous as our eyes become satiated with delicious sunsets and color grading to represent the bluish
tint of night. Overall, I believe this film is a worthy
one-time watch and I am looking forward
to viewing more projects involving these two.Follow me on Instagram: @joshuarenealvarez

Interesting character.The movie was quiete foreseeable but it was very heartwarming and that is why i gabe it 9 stars. Plus I liked the actors. It reminded me a little of Logan.

A million? The movie's premise is a movie trope in and of itself. There's a suspenseful horse-and-buggy chase. Seen it a million times before. There's an Old West stand-off between an out-numbered underdog and villainous desperadoes where the underdog protagonist uses cunning and experience to outwit his antagonists. Seen it a million times before. There are numerous scenes where the unexpected guardian uses compassion and patience to break through the child's stand-offish exterior and finally establish trust between himself and the child. Seen it a million times before.There's so much cliche, that by the time anything new or interesting happens, the viewer is already bored and annoyed.In all fairness, I guess this movie shouldn't have elicited such a strong feeling of resentment in me. But given that it stars Tom Hanks, the reviews were so strong, and I had looked forward to seeing this movie for such a long time, I guess my expectations were so high, that the moment I began to get bored I became more resentful than the movie probably deserves. That being said, I was genuinely bored for long stretches of time during this movie (even during the action scenes), and it seems like that should be something difficult to accomplish for a Western starring Tom Hanks that takes place in the rural Deep South in the years immediately following the American Civil War.",News of the World

The land, the scenery, the dust and dirt and hardship. That's why I enjoyed this film. However, the script adds several unnecessary right-on additions to Jiles' restrained and humane novel. Yes, we get it, racism and slavery are bad. The dispossession of the Kiowa is tragic. But this film traffics in Noble Savage stereotypes (in one episode not in the novel, the Kiowa act as a kind of deus ex machina at their own expense for the Captain and Johanna, and it's hard to sustain belief). In the novel, Kidd does not harbor Vietnam-type guilt over his participation in the Civil War on the part of the Confederacy. Why would he, in 1870? Hanks is playing the good guy archetype he always does, very competent, but at no point did I see him as a retired Confederate colonel in 1870s Texas. He acts like a Harvard professor. The film is uncomfortable with its own source material, which becomes a bit of a problem.

The editing is clunky, and the camera work varies from handheld, to dolly to drones so much it feels like a YouTube review video. The B roll scenic shots are so modified that they glaringly stand out from the A footage of the actors. The whole thing is a bit of visual mess.The script, as mentioned is predictable and nothing really new is accomplished other than both Tom Hanks and Director Green Grass doing a western.

Every scene is a metaphor for the world we live in today, every line a thoughtful reflection. News of the World is the right title for a film profoundly about today.",News of the World
418,rosebudfr,"Sweet little film, with wasted potential but great for my sleepless nights",6,2 April 2021,"This film kind of disappointed me. Make no mistake, this is still a touching, warm little film about a scarred Civil War veteran (what would westerns be without those?) and a scarred little girl who don't know whether she's Indian or ""white"" (bless 'em). What is nice about a Tom Hanks vehicle is that you kind of know what to expect, whatever the genre: a character and a film full decency and honesty, trying to do his best in a fallen world. Hanks is often, and rightfully, compared to Jimmy Stewart, so it's nice to see him appear in a western, although this one is no John Ford masterpiece. Hanks is kind of my comfort food I guess, and seeing him in an old-fashioned western is doubly comforting. I will probably watch this film hundreds of times in my lifetime, anytime I'll feel sad or bad, wanting to crawl in a corner and be left alone with my cuddly little western.Sure, the film could have been miles more impactful in the wider world if it had remembered its own title and shown more of the newsman's job, which was a fascinating conceit to start with and is just unexplainably forgotten pretty early on (even THE POSTMAN does a better job on that front). The film also opens on some pretty dark stuff, with background elements reminding you this is Reconstruction and that the situation in this part of the country is very tense indeed. But that turns out to be only background music, and the film chooses to focus instead on adventure, mishaps, drone shots in the great outdoors and the fuzzy feelings slowly but surely developing between the two characters.Not that I'm complaining: it's a harmless, toothless film I need when I feel down and out. Otherwise I can always rewatch THE SEARCHERS, right?",News of the World

It is a typical road set in the civil war period. The Character of Tom Hanks has nothing special about him except for his profession. He is just a regular everyday newsman, and it's quiet boring observe his life. So, the question was ""how can we show a traveling entertaining?"". The answer is we do a couple of obstacles, which the heroes are gonna get through any way (cuz it's a Tom Hanks movie). Frankly, the heroine looked interesting in the beginning. She is a white Indian, but this fact is barely used throughout the whole film except for one moment. The pace of the film is very slow, the characters and setup of the story is bleak, the film lasts almost 2 hours, and after first 40 minutes you just want to leave prematurely.

I kept waiting for something 'devastating"" to happen but that never really came about. A bit predictable at the end but hey, when I compare it to the movie I watched on HBO Max a couple of days earlier (WW1984) this movie belongs up there with Gone with the Wind (tongue in cheek and sarcastic).But all in all, a good, decent, entertaining move but not one I would ever seek out to watch again.",News of the World

Very disappointed.
The director was like we need all of the Tom Hanks all of the time.
If I wanted to see a scene straight out of Hell or High Water, I would have watched Hell or High Water. That gun battle scene was unnecessary and pointless.
Coming back to the Indians, the only time we see them are in a dust storm, probably going about their trail of tears.

Texas settlers and wanderers, damaged by the Civil War that ended five years earlier, and still in the shadow of the Lost Cause, are battling the elements and one another, as Native Americans are struggling to survive. Tom Hanks plays an itinerant 'news reader', a Confederate war vet who crisscrosses the state, bringing information to isolated towns. He befriends a traumatized, twice-orphaned young girl, who only speaks Kiowa, and sets out to bring her to her only surviving relatives. Unsurprisingly, they bond, but this is grounded in emotional truth and harsh reality.

If you were to describe the whole thing to someone else, it would take maybe 3 or 4 sentences. And it was fairly predictable how the whole thing was going to unfold.So why an 8/10, you ask? Because Tom Hanks and Helena Zengel made me believe it. Their naturalness in, not just acting their roles, but BEING their roles simply drew me in and kept my attention the whole way through. Hanks is obviously brilliant at his craft and this film was no exception. In fact, I was even more impressed than usual. With a single understated look, he could convey simple yet complex thoughts like reluctance, pity, confusion, conflict, and resignation in no more than a second or two. And the young Miss Zengel by his side was stunning in portraying her character's development, while never speaking more than a word or two of English.

But the laziness in what gets them out of trouble is truly staggering. Just when things get too real and there seems to be no way out, an incredible ex machina rolls up to move the story along. Legit it was hardship, saved miraculously, cut to next scene.What does this movie want to say? I have absolutely no idea. The only message clear to me is when he is forced to read propaganda and refuses to, ""giving people a choice."" But Johanna? What does she represent? She was raised by native Americans, Hanks tells her she doesn't belong there, she finally accepts that, what is that supposed to teach me? Honestly have no idea, stick to your kind? Don't be something you're not? What are they trying to say.What happened to the native Americans is a truly hard breaking and incredible story sweeping with hidden meanings for our time but this film does not spend any time of them. Why? The premise is provides opportunities for us to learn from their culture and teachings and compare it to our modern society but all we get is, ""we only think about moving straight, they think about moving round."" Come on now fellas.Same goes for Hanks character? Man reads news, lost his wife and thinks it is he's fault because of the terrible things he did, Karma and all that jazz, so was ""saving"" Johanna his redemption?

My wife and I listened to an audio reading of the book and then watched the move the next day. What a letdown! We wondered whether the writer and director of the movie had even bothered to read the book. The book by Paulette Jiles is a beautiful story about a 72-year old man, Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, an itinerant news reader in post-Civil War Texas, who agrees to take a 10-year old girl, Johanna, on a 400-mile trip, in a horse-drawn wagon, down to the San Antonio region to deliver her to her family. Johanna had been kidnapped by the Kiowa Indians four years earlier and all members of her immediate family had been killed. But she has relatives in south Texas and Captain Kidd (Tom Hanks) Is given $50 by federal officials to take Johanna to her relatives. However, Johanna wants to return to her Kiowa family, she no longer speaks English, she does not dress like young girls her age who are not living in a Native American community, and she is a strong-willed young lady. So Captain Kidd has his hands full, in trying to communicate with Johanna, in fending off a number of perils that they face during their journey, and in dealing with the vagaries of old age. The entire story is built on the relationship between Captain Kidd and Johanna. In the book, this relationship is beautifully played out. In the movie the relationship is never developed. And most of the adventures that Captain Kidd and Johanna face are missing from the movie. If the writer and Director of the movie had simply followed the story in the book, the movie would have been a beautiful production. They not only cut out important details of the story (which is inevitable when a movie is adapted from a book), but they also destroyed important premises underlying Ms. Jiles' novel. They tried to write a different story, which was trite, boring, and hard to comprehend at times. It was butchery at its best and it probably explains why the movie has not done very well at the box office. It was a great opportunity lost, to say the least. And we were very sad because we were very excited to watch the movie after reading the book. To say that we were disappointed is a great understatement. We loved the book.

It's also about how you deal with the tragic circumstances that caused you to be alone. I watched this on a plane with no preconceived ideas and this film was a beautiful gut punch on so many levels. I really think this is a movie that will last and find a larger audience in years to come because it has so much to say about the basic human condition; that on some level we all feel alone in the world and we're all looking for some place we can call home. Tom Hanks is excellent as Captain Kidd who makes a meager living going from town to town reading to illiterate small town folk the stories of the world. Hanks elevates anything he's in but what I love most about him is that he doesn't try to push the emotion of what's happening on the audience. He is simply Captain Kidd with a tragic past doing his job and now this wild stranger comes into his life. As for that stranger, Helena Zengel was the perfect choice. There is a saying in acting, ""the words mean nothing"" and without giving anything away, she proves that in her eyes, in her looks and in her physical reactions to what's going on.

It's an unusual script in the the lead Character ( Ton Hanks) is someone who travels from town to town reading the newspapers, for 10c admission.
I did not realise that such characters existed, so with the distances they travelled, the news must have been history but the time most people heard it!
However it makes fir an intriguing and watchable story, even though it nearly sinks into schmalz on occasions due to the female lead, a young Indian girl who becomes Hank's companion on the road. There is one gunfight ( well, he is a civil war captain, so he has to show off his skills) but that's about it.
As you'd expect a happy ending , from a family film, watchable during lockdown.

Omgoodness, Tom Hanks was such a believable character for this period. I'm sure he could have pulled off the traditional 'cowboy' character but the twist they gave him as as war Vet added new dimension. It didn't matter what side he was on, it was the person he became. True to form, he was good and honorable and heroic, fair and just, even when it called for extreme measures. He knew he was flawed and so was everyone else. I gave it 10 - I think the slower pace in a couple of places that this story called for comes off as dramatic breathing room.

496,mcdaidn,Very good but nothing ground-breaking,7,7 March 2021,"With names like Paul Greengrass and Tom Hanks attached to a film you can almost always expect it to be a well made and reliably entertaining film and this didn't disappoint. Unfortunately I feel like it never really exceeded these expectations though.
Greengrass is unquestionably an accomplished filmmaker and this comes across; the story is well told and nicely shot across an expansive post-civil war Texas. The restlessness and discontent that existed in the South following the war, depicted subtly and believably by Greengrass and his strong cast, is the driving force behind many of the events and challenges that Kidd (Hanks) and Leonberger (Zengel) experience throughout their journey. On the whole, these events appeared natural and the story flowed but at times it got a little bumpy. Some plot points seemed to appear out of the blue purely as a ploy to progress the characters into the required state for the next significant event. I'm fully aware this is necessary at times but occasionally it came at the expense of believability.
In essence this comes down to whether you are looking for a more realistic (in my opinion), character driven storyline or a more event driven storyline with the intention of reaching a predefined end goal. In general, films need to be event driven due to their limited running time but the trick is making them appear as character driven as possible. For the best part, News of the World achieves this but does falter at times.
Tom Hanks puts in a solid performance as Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd, not his best but still very good. It's difficult for someone as recognisable as Hanks to truly have an audience see only the character but he has done this more effectively in recent years with Captain Phillips and Sully. On the other hand, Helena Zengel has the advantage of being virtually unknown in comparison although this shouldn't take away from her performance. She is excellent as the innocent but by no means naïve Johanna and deserving of her Golden Globe nomination.
News of the World isn't ground-breaking and felt a little formulaic at times but the story remained captivating and was an enjoyable watch thanks to its strong cast and experienced director.",News of the World

The overall storyline kept me interested and invested in the characters.

There's a tinge of a ""True Grit"" vibe (unwillingly traveling with a young girl), but the true focus is on the lonely traveller, not the child. Some parts feel like a classic exciting western, some parts feel like a character drama, and other parts subtly portray the socioeconomics of 1870's southern Texas.

526,Patrick_Reyntens,Not a very tight script but a nice mood,6,5 April 2021,"It's not a bad movie for a lazy Sunday evening but there were a couple of things that I found a bit disturbing.The captain and the girl encounter 3 men who want to 'buy the girl'. Just when stuff gets heated the cops intervene and take the bad guys away. I'm not sure why the bandits were taken to jail because the captain didn't tell the cops that they wanted to 'rape the girl or buy her for pleasure'. The bandits have to go the police station to fill out some papers and at early dawn the captain and the girl leave for their destination. The 3 men also leave at dawn to chase them down and get the girl. They apparently know exactly which way they were going and when they'd leave because it didn't take long for the villains to catch them...When the captain and the girl reach the Buffalo killing factory, they meet this boy who seems to be smiling a lot. He seemed to be very interested in the girl and had this 'rapy' look in his eyes. His only remaining family member was killed by the boss but it wasn't clear if he was really hurt by it or not. His character was very confusing. He made this 180° turn in the end when he shot the boss - and none of his men noticed. There was a vibe of akwardness when he left the captain and the girl. He wanted to keep travelling but the captain suggested he'd start his new life. It was a confusing scene to me. I was expecting something to happen. And it wasn't clear if the boy had good intentions or not throughout all of his scenes. Maybe the acting was just too shallow, not explored enough.Some of the FX were horrible, like the sand storm. I'm not sure if and old guy, thristy and exhausted can move around like that in a snowstorm, yelling...
Just after this scene, indians pass by. The girl talks to one of the guys and get's a horse. She forget to ask for water apparently. Something she really needed before the sand storm. We see the gang of Indians passing by. Most of them on foot so giving away a horse is quite a sacrifice. This is probably a bit of PC motivating this.These are just 3 confusing scenes to me but maybe nobody else was bothered by it...Anyway overall it isn't a bad movie.

565,midnightgumchew,Not your typical Western,7,31 December 2020,"Westerns have had their time in the spotlight but as time has gone on, they've been pushed onto the side. ""News of the World"" isn't the stereotypical Western where there's bandits at every corner, long horse chases, bank robberies, or Clint Eastwood; but that doesn't stop it from being enjoyable.Tom Hanks has a great performance in this movie. It's not nearly as memorable or notable as Josh Baskins from ""Big"" or Woody from ""Toy Story"" but he always brings a certain charm to each movie he's in. The movie, in real simplified terms, is Tom Hanks' character Captain Kidd reacting to the situation he's put in. And Tom Hanks excels in reacting to situations he's put in.However the real star is the actress who acts opposite to Hanks; Helena Zengel. She does a fantastic job in this role. The whole time, she has this fish-out-of-water, deer-in-the-headlights look about her. Only in the final scene does her character, Johanna, smile. And once you see her smile, your whole body is washed over with relief because that one smile feels so earned. So good job to both the leads.The film is also technically proficient. With stunning wide shots and intimate close ups, you are reminded, but not bashed over the head, of classic spaghetti Westerns. The color palette is appropriately void of bright colors but never too bland to the point where you get confused where the characters are or bored at watching the movie. And finally the pacing. Sure, the movie takes a slower time getting from point A to B and some might be turned off by it. I found it tolerable but others won't. Just know what you're getting into when you buy a ticket.All in all, a good movie. Not as memorable as some of the others out there but a good watch nonetheless.",News of the World

Having finished the movie, I looked at the time and wondered why I wasted two hours when I could've left at the midpoint, where the ""Western"" action scenes ended, and cut my losses. The movie had no substance and was extremely dry. There was no reason to be invested in any specific character, and it was a struggle to try to be. The actors did well with the script they were given, but to make a point: most all positive reviews of this movie reference Hanks' acting. It's not about the plot, or how the movie made them feel, but a pointless reference to Hanks. Well shot, with a plot, albeit milquetoast, and painfully, unnecessarily long.

It's hard to understand the many changes the filmmakers apparently felt compelled to make. Instead of portraying Freedman Britt Johnson as a real, live person (and possibly setting up a prequel based on Paulette Giles's The Color of Lightning), he's stripped of his lines and only shown at the end of a rope. Captain Jefferson Kyle Kidd is transformed from war-weary veteran all too aware of the powder keg he might ignite to a reformer and activist more than willing to do just that. A wagon crash is added to clumsily increase the stakes. But - no worry - mythic Native Americans are invented to appear in a dust storm and save the day. And as hard as it is to criticize an icon like Tom Hanks, he wasn't really up to the task. One can only imagine what the movie would have been like had they cast someone like a Lonesome Dove-era Robert Duvall in the lead - and trusted Jiles's powerful and thoroughly researched work.",News of the World

Towards the end, Captain Kidd (Hanks) says what happened to his wife was punishment for ""everything he did"" during his time in the Civil War. But he did not come across, up to that point, as a man wrestling with his conscience in any way: he was more like a benevolent storyteller, rather than a battle weary former soldier.

On another note, the story it self can be boring from time to time but Paul Greengrass defenitelly knew how to gain our attention and appreciation once more.

620,casper-25450,Unforgettable,10,14 March 2021,"Go see this movie. A small jewel in this world of fast paced action movies and first person shooter games.
This is a story about the America's, a multiplicity of people having settled in different parts and defending their differences. A story about a war veteran getting burdened with the task of bringing a young orphan to her uncle and aunt down south. It's about north vs south, blue vs red, immigrants vs natives, people of different cultures and home countries. In this movie everyone is lost and everyone longs for a peaceful home.
This is a story about people having to deal with the hardships of life and fate, and the hope for a better future for everybody.
A story about overcoming differences and the blossoming of unconditional love.
A slow story, to sip slowly like a glass of good red wine, to leave the mad running world behind and pace down for an hour or two. If you are open to it, this movie tells a much, much deeper story. Look and listen between the lines.
I hope that you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
Very, very impressed with the acting skills of Helena Zengel, and of course Tom Hanks.",News of the World

623,sergior-02917,A Great Atmospherical Western Movie,9,10 February 2021,"I usually don't write reviews, but seeing that this great movie is getting rather low scores, I wanted to share my opinion on it:
I think that the movie is really good. It combines a great narrative with some western movie themes, which we all like - there is a little bit of action, a bit of suspense, some very colorful characters and a deep realistic down to earth atmosphere. This movie actually reminded me of Tarantino's work in westerns, but without pointless carnage. The dialogues are deep, you are really getting to know the characters and their stories. You are even learning some new languages along the way. Regarding the technical aspects in this movie, I liked the sound, ambiance and the scenic stereotypical western shots very much.
The two main actors are great and actually show a range of emotions - something, what is not always seen in every movie recently.
All in all, if you have any interest in a historical western as a movie genre, this movie is right up your alley!",News of the World

Ok, so, you would have two eye-friendly characters, a girl with direct volcanic behaviour and a legend of an actor, but then - it is the music that makes the movie such a precious, emotionally lasting thing. It really interprets it. It is pushing the scenes to the limit. Sometimes the characters can do even without speaking. Just think of the scene when Johanna is returning to her home. And a weird thing about about it, most people watching the movie are not really noticing it.So if you get the chance to watch it - make sure that your audio equipment is ready.",News of the World

Fortunately I have a serviceable home theater setup, so didn't miss the undeniably beautiful cinematography. But the story felt derivative (Unforgiven, True Grit (2010)), and the characters, especially the bad guys, seemed comic book. The picture of who to like, and who to hate, was painted in garish primary colors. Ultimately the hero's travels through Texas felt like a Liberals journey through MAGA land, right down to FOX News, and it seemed the only message beyond that was ""white settlers are unenlightened, stumbling along the straight and narrow, while indigenous people understand life as a circle"". Don't get me wrong, I'm not offended by that message, but it's not exactly revelatory. Silly movie. But pretty.",News of the World
