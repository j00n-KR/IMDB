0,MartinHafer,Not great but quite enjoyable...,6,29 December 2010,"This is exactly the sort of film you can watch when you just want to turn off your brain and enjoy a bit of nothing with your family. It won't change your life and many of the jokes fall flat, but overall there's still enough to it to make it worth renting.The plot is very contrived. After all, who could imagine that five guys who played on a basketball team together at age 12 would return 30 years later for the coach's funeral?! And, would you ever expect, should this ACTUALLY happen, that they would all then spend a vacation together?! No.at least not on this planet! So, the plot is dumband the film is best when it's NOT about the plot (for example, who care about the stupid basketball game?!). But the camaraderie and jokes are generally very good—and this makes up for the suck-tastic plot. Not great, but worth seeing if it comes on TV—and try not to think too much about the script. Pleasant and undemanding.By the way, look out for Joyce Van Patten in one of the main female parts. It's nice to see her again. Maybe it's me, but I can't recall seeing her in films for some time and she looked amazingly good.",Grown Ups
1,TheLittleSongbird,Lazy,4,8 July 2011,"I am not a big Adam Sandler fan, but I do really like Spanglish, The Wedding Singer, Reign Over Me, Happy Gilmore and Punch Drunk Love, while disliking Little Nicky, You Don't Mess with the Zohan and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, so I thought why not as the trailer was sort of interesting.Sadly, I found Grown Ups a rather lazy effort. I did like how it looked, the locations and scenery are very nice and the editing and photography were also better than expected. The soundtrack was decent too, and I did like the first 10-15 minutes or so. I didn't like the acting much, but there is one actor who clearly puts gusto into his performance and that's Kevin James.The rest of the cast range from adequate to below par, not helped by their uniformly shallow and unlikeable characters. Adam Sandler is irritating, Chris Rock underplays, Salma Hayek's acting is very forced often, Rob Schneider overplays and David Spade is rather limited and goes through the motions. The direction is not awful, but far from great, most of it is unexceptional while having the occasional flash of decency. The pace is uneven, some of the comedy scenes feel rushed and the more sentimental scenes feel pedestrian.What spoils Grown Ups is the writing and story. The writing is pretty much awful, with clichéd and stale jokes and dialogue that made me groan rather than laugh. And then there's the story, which was very thin and predictable on the whole, with the comedy scenes rather forced and the sentimental scenes rather mawkish. All in all, not a complete travesty, but rather lazy and didn't do much for me. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Grown Ups
2,SnoopyStyle,The more bromance The better,6,5 October 2013,"Five childhood friends reunite for their basketball coach's funeral. It's some 30 years after their championship game as a bunch of 12 year olds.This movie works for one reason only. It's the chemistry and comradary between the five leads; Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider. The stories and quite frankly the ladies are mostly unimportant. They really need to give them some more funny stuff to do. They need to spread some of the stupid and silly stuff around. It works better with the bromance. The more time those five can spend together alone the better.",Grown Ups
3,Prismark10,Big kids and little kids,6,14 April 2014,"This is a comedic low brow 'The Big Chill' played for laughs and trying to make some points about parent and kids and relationships and material things are not important starring some rich Hollywood actors.The death of their old basketball coach causes some of the winning basketball team of 1978 to reunite. Adam Sandler is a rich Hollywood agent with a hot wife, Salma Hayek, spoilt kids and a nanny. Kevin James has a 4 year old who still drinks breast milk, Chris Rock has a wife who works whilst he is a stay at home dad, Rob Schneider lives with an older woman and has 3 kids from previous relationships who turn, two of them simply to provide eye candy for the audience.We have some gross out jokes such as urinating in a water-park pool, the dead coach's ashes being thrown over food, a boy breast feeding etc. Some spoilt brats too busy texting and wanting the finer things in life on demand.Over the weekend the kids enjoy the simpler things in life and learn to get along with other kids and grow up a bit. The adults too learn to value their loved ones but in a slight story some of the 'issues' come out of the blue.Still it is sporadic fun, watchable and Steve Buscemi pops up to provide the biggest laughs.",Grown Ups
4,nogodnomasters,BIG CHILL COMEDY,6,2 August 2018,"The movie starts out with 5 kids who look like the adult stars winning the city championship in basketball in 1978 at the buzzer. 30 years later they reunite at Coach ""Buzzer's"" funeral and opt to spend a weekend together at a lake house with their families. Three of them have ""normal"" families that don't appreciate them. A fourth is married to a woman twice his age and a fifth is still single.The humor consists mostly at exchanging barbs and zingers, making fun of people who are fat, short,ugly, or old. There is a sophomoric running joke of the 4 year old that still breast feeds (even in public) because the liberal permissive parents can't say no. This joke could have been left out. (Sometimes less is more.) After spending a few hours outdoors, the big five notices that their families are all inside in their electronic world. They go inside and force the family to enjoy the great outdoors with expected results. Eventually the team they beat for the championship as kids challenges them to another basketball game because Robin Williams didn't gross us out enough.The movie ends on a warm and fuzzy note as many inane comedies do, teaching us a lesson on the importance of family and friends, but not overly warm and fuzzy. I thought Salma Hayek did an excellent job considering her poorly written lines and overall weak script",Grown Ups
5,kosmasp,Kidding around,5,23 October 2010,"As with most of the Adam Sandler comedies it's more about the kid still being there. Even if the outer shell is there and is trying to fool you, there is still more kid inside him than an adult. Of course this shouldn't come as a surprise to you. If it does, you clearly haven't seen his other movies.And depending on your feelings for simple comedy, you might like it more or less than what I have rated. I never was a big fan of Adam Sandler and most of his movies (Little Nicky and the one with the Golfer), though I liked him when he played in more dramatic movies. But then again, most people do like him, when he's funny, so don't be discouraged, if you haven't tried any Sandler yet ... take a look inside and decide for yourself, if this is for you or not ...",Grown Ups
6,classicsoncall,"""I hope tomorrow you'll find better things...""",6,12 October 2021,"I don't think you could have come up with a better ensemble of contemporary comics to make a film as you have here, but with that said, the picture is only slightly amusing with no real laugh out loud moments to speak of. Instead of going for a cheap gimmick like the four year old still breast feeding, the writers could have cleaned things up and gone for all around family entertainment, especially with all the couples basically on vacation with their kids in tow. The back story of Coach Buzzer's (Blake Clark) influence on the lives of the five teammates only bookends the picture and doesn't provide as meaningful a reunion as it might have if the men involved had gathered on their own to honor his memory. As it is, there are some humorous moments, and others that seem to have a build up and then fall kind of flat. The film's rating here on IMDb seems appropriate, pointing to it's worth as a somewhat amusing time killer.",Grown Ups
7,jboothmillard,Grown Ups,4,10 January 2011,"I thought this film looked funny from the adverts I saw, I assumed however that this film was rated low by the critics, either way I was going to see it, from director Dennis Dugan (Big Daddy, The Benchwarmers). Basically there was a team of five twelve years old CYO basketball players that won a championship game, and now all grown up they are reuniting thirty years later to attend the funeral of their coach, Bobby 'Buzzer' Ferdinando (Blake Clark). In their adulthood, Marcus Higgins (The Emperor's New Groove's David Spade) is a lonely drinker, wig-wearing Rob Hilliard (Rob Schneider) has three daughters he doesn't see much and is in love with a much older woman, jobless Eric Lamonsoff (Kevin James) is overweight and married to Sally (Maria Bello), Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) is a house-husband ordered about by his wife and mother-in-law, and Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler) is a successful Hollywood agent married to fashion designer Roxanne Chase (Salma Hayek) and takes his kids for granted. After the funeral they have arranged to all spend time together in a lake house for the 4th of July weekend, Lenny and Roxanne plan to leave after a few days for her fashion show, but they have all the fun they can in the meantime. They scatter the Coach's ashes in the water, and after hanging out and talking, using rope swings, going to a water park and using cup phones, Lenny and Roxanne decide to stay. There are some arguments between them, with Marcus, Rob, Eric, Sally and Kurt getting involved as well, but they all apologise ready for the 4th of July barbecue, go against the mean Dickie Bailey (Colin Quinn) and his basketball team, they may lose but it doesn't damage relationships. Also starring Maya Rudolph as Deanne McKenzie, Joyce Van Patten as Gloria, Jamie Chung as Amber Hilliard, Steve Buscemi as Wiley and Tim Meadows as Malcolm. The big name male and female stars were obviously to draw in the film's audience, the jokes are a little cliché and there are some sentimental sequences, but it is not that terrible or boring, an average comedy. Okay!",Grown Ups
8,paul_haakonsen,It was alright,6,31 August 2010,"Well, this movie was not really a type of comedy that makes you fall out of the chair laughing. Wait, I am not saying that this is a bad movie, not at all. The story was very nice and the characters were very believable.Sure, there were moments throughout the movie that proved funny and silly, and they worked well enough. But this movie was not just about making you laugh. It had a really nice story to tell about friendship and I liked that part. The comedy was just a secondary thing here.As for the list of actors and actresses in the movie, wow! Lots of really nice performers here, and great comedy actors as well. And I must admit that I think they all did good with their roles and their all brought their own unique (and believable) touch to their characters and the movie in general. Good to see that the stereotypical comedian can achieve more than just laughs.Even a supporting role such as the one portrayed by Steve Buscemi. He was so well cast for that part and just seeing him in that role was cool.I was thoroughly entertained by the movie. Sure, it is hardly the type of movie that you will pick up to watch again once watched it already. But it is nice nonetheless.",Grown Ups
9,tavm,Grown Ups is a nice and funny movie of former SNL players,7,28 June 2010,"Just watched this with my movie theatre working friend and his nephew. In this one, star/producer/writer Adam Sandler reunites with his former SNL castmates David Spade, Chris Rock, and Rob Schneider as former school playmates of basketball along with Kevin James after their former coach-who is played by Blake Clark, a person I last heard as the Slinky Dog on Toy Story 3-passes away. Before one thinks this would be a revisitation of Rock's previous film Death at a Funeral, once the mourning part is over, they all-along with wives and kids and other relatives-go to the gang's former camping grounds for further joking, bonding, swimming, and the requisite challenge to a rematch from former rivals-and fellow former SNL castmates-Colin Quinn and Tim Meadows. Not everything works but there were still plenty of funny lines and stunts and while, yes, there was the corny confession scene of everybody forgiving each other, Grown Ups is a lot of harmless fun even with some of the more risqué jokes in tow. Also providing some humorous moments are Maya Rudolph (one more former SNLer), Maria Bello, Salma Hayek, and, as Schneider's way middle-aged wife, Joyce Van Patten not to mention usual Sandler player Steve Buscemi. So, having just watched a movie full of SNL alumni, I'm now going to see three classic comedies starring members of the original cast. The one referred to as the ""Not Ready for Prime Time Players"".

11,dbborroughs,Unreal and fake,1,4 July 2010,"Rarely do I have the urge to beat up the people connected with a film, but thats the case with Grown Ups possibly the least entertaining film Adam Sandler and crew have been attached to.The plot has a bunch of guys, connected by a winning basketball team in their childhood all coming together after the death of their coach. Their lives are miserable and their families terrible but lovable, but coming together they find its all been a wonderful life.Or something.Its rich whiny stars playing rich whiny people in a story that is fake as they come. There are no characters their are only situations and punch lines. At no point did I feel any of these people or situations were real. It just felt like I was being put on and sold a bill of goods.I really didn't like this film at all.",Grown Ups
12,zardoz-13,An Adam Sandler Comedy for People Who Hate Adam Sandler,8,30 June 2010,"""Happy Gilmore"" director Dennis Duggan's new ensemble feel-good farce, ""Grown Ups"" is an Adam Sandler movie for people who hate Adam Sandler movies. The two times that I saw this comedy, the audience consisted of people who were older than the characters in the movie. This entertaining but lightweight, character-driven, middle-of-the-road reunion comedy resembles ""The Big Chill"" minus its tragedy and recalls the Robin Williams laugh-fest ""The Best of Times"" about old high school rivals looking for a game rematch. Family values outnumber the gross-out gags of earlier Sandler movies, but the insults and putdowns are still hilarious. The mellow but amusing ""Grown Ups"" features a lot of affectionate wisecracking between the starring quintet. Sometimes they can be quite merciless with their ridicule of each other, but it is nothing like the heavyweight Judd Apatow comedy-drama ""Funny People."" Whether you yearn for the earlier Sandler juvenile comedies or prefer his rather mature epics, ""Grown Ups"" strikes a nice balance between the two types of Sandler films. Mind you, half of the comedy here is fueled by public urination, kicks to the groin, geysers of breast milk, Grandma's gnarly bunion, urn ashes dusted into a KFC Grilled Chicken bucket, and bare butt male nudity. Twice in the movie Kevin James cavorts with the KFC bucket on his head like a helmet. Old school Sandler fans may abhor the fact that their hero has gone mainstream. ""Grown Ups"" definitely appeals to an entirely different demographic with its warm-hearted narrative about families, but even old school Sandler fans should find something redeeming about it.Sandler has come a long way since ""Billy Madison"" back in 1995. Typically, the former ""Saturday Night Live"" comedian plays either wisenheimers who flout responsibility or clueless underdogs. Usually, Sandler's most famous underdogs are ""The Water Boy"" and ""Little Nicky."" Gradually, over the years Sandler's smart aleck image has begun to erode, beginning with ""Big Daddy,"" another Duggan movie, where he found himself stuck with raising a child. Sandler's career turned a corner when he made ""Punch Drunk Love,"" ""The Longest Yard,"" and even publicized his support of gay rights with ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry."" Indeed, Sandler has mellowed so much that he has made movies, such as ""Spanglish,"" that would make his ""SNL"" fans puke Sandler plays powerful Hollywood film agent Lenny Feder. Lenny can pull the likes of a Brad Pitt or Julia Roberts off your picture. Nevertheless, his success embarrasses him in front of his friends. Wed to trophy wife Roxanne Chase-Feder (Salma Hayek of ""Desperado"") with her own fashion line, they have two sons, Greg (Jake Goldberg of ""The Ant Bully"") and Keithie (Cameron Boyce of ""Eagle Eye""), an adorable daughter, Becky (Alexys Nycole Sanchez in her film debut), and Rita (Di Quon of ""Pulse""), their tireless nanny. Lenny's boys are hopeless snobs who thrive on violent video games when they aren't texting Rita with their every wish and demand. The same weekend that the family had scheduled a flight to Milan, Italy, for Roxanne's fashion show, is ruined when Lenny gets some bad news. Their beloved basketball coach, Bobby 'Buzzer' Ferdinando (Blake Clark of ""Intolerable Cruelty""), has died. Lenny, Eric (Kevin James of ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop""), Kurt (Chris Rock of ""Lethal Weapon IV""), Marcus (David Spade of ""Joe Dirt""), and Rob (Rob Schneider of ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"") comprised Buzzer's only undefeated middle school basketball team. These middle-aged crazy best friends forever show up at Buzzer's New England funeral with their families. Lenny stumbles through his eulogy, while the hypersensitive Rob warbles his version of ""Ave Maria."" Afterward, they settle into a lake house and celebrate their 30-year reunion over the Fourth of July weekend. Half of the comedy emerges from the characters. For example, Rob is a New Age vegan with three divorcees, wears his hair in a pompadour, and is married to an old hippie, Gloria (Joyce Van Patten of ""Something Big""), that everybody mistakes for his mother. Pratfall prone Eric and wife Sally (Maria Bello of ""Coyote Ugly"") have two kids, Donna (Ada-nicole Sanger of ""BrainSurge"") and Bean (Frank and Morgan Gingerich). Although Bean is four years old, he still nurses at Sally's breasts. Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) is an emasculated ""Mr. Mom"" whose corporate wife Deanne (Maya Rudolph of ""MacGruber"") brings home pizzas for their two children and her flatulent mother-in-law Mama Ronzoni (Ebony Jo-Ann of ""Kate & Leopold""). Conversely, Marcus is an single, drunken Lothario. These guys are so comfortable with themselves that they can insult each other without getting upset.Lenny makes his kids get out of the house and into the woods. Initially, Roxanne isn't happy because she packed for Milan instead of a casual reunion. One day she discovers she has forgotten how to skip a rock across Lake Amoskeag. She decides the Feders must forego the Milan fashion show and reacquaint themselves with rustic rituals. The guys paddle off to a island where Rob spreads Buzzer's ashes. Eventually, one of the rival team basketball players from the 1978 championship, Dickie Bailey (Colin Quinn of ""Crocodile' Dundee II""), goads them into a rematch. Lenny never misses a basket when he shoots. He decides the time has come for the Dickie Baileys of the world to start winning, so misses a basket and loses the game. ""Grown Ups"" alternates between the adults making their couch potato, video game addicted kids play outside and their own slapstick antics at each other's expense. Buffoonish Eric tries his luck with a rope hanging from a tree by a lake. Predictably, he doesn't turn loose and swings back to smash into a tree and then plunge into the woods. One of the funniest ""Grown Ups"" gags involves shooting an arrow into the sky. They call it 'arrow roulette' and the winner is the only guy who refuses to move. ""Grown Ups"" differs from ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan,"" but generates more than enough chuckles.",Grown Ups
13,Calicodreamin,Good fun,7,20 September 2021,"A solid Adam Sandler comedy that's full of good vibes and good humor. The jokes land for the most part, and the cast has good chemistry. The comedy flows easily and while there isn't really a plot, it's easy enough to overlook. Arrow roulette anyone?",Grown Ups
14,view_and_review,Sandler on the Slide,5,6 June 2014,"I consider Grown Ups to be a colossal failure. Is it the worst movie ever made? Not even. Is it the worst Adam Sandler movie? I don't know. What I do know is that he had all star talent in this film and the feature didn't produce. Rock, James, Spade, Sandler and even Schneider... all names that have had enormous success so I was expecting a laugh a minute; thud.Does this film prove that chemistry is more important than talent? Or does it prove that Sandler is losing his touch? It may be a little bit of both. For sure, Sandler is losing his touch, but it may also be that those superstar comedians don't do well sharing the stage. In either case the net result was the same; the movie did not nearly live up to the high expectations.",Grown Ups
15,neil-476,Amusing but not exceptional,7,1 September 2010,"I have grave reservations about Adam Sandler. His comedy work exhibits two major flaws as far as I can see. One, it is sometimes unpleasantly cruel and, two it can sometimes be excessively sentimental.Grown Ups concerns five men feted at age 12 when their basketball team wins a championship, who convene over the 4rh July weekend with their families on the occasion of the funeral of their coach. Childhood is revisited and lessons are learned.Some of the humour here is cruel. I do understand that cruelty can sometimes be an essential ingredient of some humour, but there are times when the cruelty overpowers the humour and there is a case in point here - there is a lot of fun, much of it unpleasant and uncalled-for, poked at the older woman (Joyce Van Patten) to whom Rob Schneider's character is married. While this is a valid target for humour, some of it is nasty enough to compromise any sympathy one might have for the characters generating it. Contrast this with the cruel humour the five friends practise on each other, all in fun.This was the only aspect of the humour I didn't like. The rest of it - character, situation, verbal, and especially knockabout physical humour, all worked well.There is a sugary slab of saccharine sentiment at the three quarters point, but it is mercifully brief.The messages are delivered without subtlety, but they are fair points to make.Jasmine and Madison were pleasing eye candy. I was expecting Bridget to turn from a caterpillar into a butterfly, and was disappointed when it didn't happen.Steve Buscemi had a short but very funny cameo.Overall, I laughed quite a lot and so did the rest of the cinema, so I have to reckon this as a success.",Grown Ups
16,anaconda-40658,Juvenile.,4,13 July 2015,"Grown Ups (2010): Dir: Dennis Dugan / Cast: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider: Boring comedy that remembers those carefree childhood innocent days where technology was not an interruption. Five friends get together after their childhood basketball coach passes away and they decide to go to a lake house for family time. Directed by Dennis Dugan whose better comedy credits include You Don't Mess With the Zohan and I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry. Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider go through the usual family harassment while trying to relax. Sandler presents his usual persona and leads a competition against a standard group of rivals. Rock is extremely underused as a stay at home father. Kevin James is basically the brunt of fat jokes whose opening swimming pool scene is one of the few really funny moments. Spade plays a drunken pervert who often turns up in the midst of trouble. Only the fifth billed Schneider has an interesting role with his romantic life with older women and has hot daughters whom his friends stand around and gaze at like hyenas watching a gazelle before brunch. The film is well made and plays as a buddy flick that male viewers may possibly relate too, but unfortunately the payoff is hardly funny or rewarding. There are too many characters and less time to really develop the main characters for whom the stars portray. It does contain a theme regarding technology and taking the simple things for granted. It remembers the old days when films were better. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Grown Ups
17,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Grown Ups,8,14 August 2010,"It's been some time since I consistently laughed that loud during a comedy; I will unabashedly say that despite its lukewarm performance at home, I had enjoyed this for the zaniness and the assembling of an ensemble of comedians who seem to be having a ball of a time in bringing this film to fruition. Written by Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf, director Dennis Dugan probably got it easy to bring them all working together since he's work with most of the marquee names in films like You Don't Mess With The Zohan, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, and The Benchwarmers, and yes, I'd enjoyed those mentioned comedies too.The gist of the story tells of a get together of best basketball friends at the time of their coach's death. Having not seen each other for so long, they decided to spend the Fourth of July weekend together with their respective families in their old hang out as an extension to their meetup, to relive the good old days. Naturally each brings their own set of issues to the table, but the film offers them up more for laughs, and a lot of focus going for Sandler's Lenny Feder in settling with his jet-setting wife Roxanne (Salma Hayek) and spoilt brat kids, because daddy is now some big shot Hollywood agent.The film reminisces how life was like back at a time when technology was not so pervasive and prevalent, and a time when growing up meant getting together with other kids and have fun in the real world, not virtually through a computer or communication medium. It dwells on how technology has inevitably evolved our lifestyles and that of the next generation's, that they are missing out on the good old days in the building of character, resilience and experience. Children need to get out of their shells of comfort to live life, if that's what the message in the film is all about, and as adults, we should learn to hang loose from our hectic lifestyles once in a while, to chill with close friends whom we hold no secrets to.But let's not kid ourselves, we're in this film to see the likes of, besides Sandler and Hayek, the other cast members of Kevin James who automatically assumes all jokes regarding physicality (and I suppose he's on his way to become a great physical comedy actor), Maria Bello being the mum who still breastfeeds her four year old kid, Chris Rock as the unappreciated house husband, Maya Rudolph as his very pregnant, alpha-female wife, David Spade as the only bachelor amongst the group of friends and whose acid tongue doesn't spare anyone from his barbs, Rob Schneider as the spiritual weirdo whose wife is of a granny's age, and Joyce Van Patten as that still-sexually active senior citizen. Most of the best scenes come from the cast members getting together, either during the guy's hang out, or the ladies themselves, or when everyone gets together for meals or an evening wind down, that the good natured jabs and barbs come fast and furious. It seemed like their ad-libbing aplenty here, with each given a free role to outwit one another, that makes this comedy work wonders especially when everyone's delivering their punchlines with natural ease, building on the energy created by peers.And that's not forgetting the zany situations they find themselves in, which of course are engineered for laughs, such as those at the water theme park, the diner, and the carnival. Almost every scene here pays off and don't overstay their welcome, knowing jolly well when to cut short any unfunny moments, and when to allow situations to run a little bit longer when everyone seemed to be on a roll.It's a get together of friends and family that most of us can identify with, because if we have a bunch of close friends and it's time to get together, I suppose we're all up for similar shenanigans, or at least be up for some good natured ribbing amongst one another over food and drinks, and probably relive the old days by doing some of the things we do back then, that makes this film run parallel with our own realities. This one's a winner in my books, and I highly recommend it.",Grown Ups
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,One of the laziest movies I have ever seen,2,5 July 2010,"A couple of weeks ago I had the pleasure of seeing a great Adam Sandler performance in Funny People. I was telling my friends how my opinion might have started to change with Sandler and that he does have a lot of potential to be a great actor. Then my friend dragged me to see Grown Up's, Adam Sandler sent me back with this failure of a movie. My God, my head hurts from this movie, it's like Adam Sandler just sent his friends over to his vacation home and said ""Hey! See those camera's? Let's act like idiots for 2 hours and make millions of dollars by releasing the footage as a movie!"", heck, for a few million dollars I would just film how my friends and I act if I was guaranteed good money for it. Adam Sandler wrote this script exactly for his own ego, his character is successful, a great basketball player, a wonderful father, a kind man, married to Selma Hayek, rich, loving, funny do you get the point yet? This is one of the laziest and most hurtful movies I have seen this year and is a shame to the word ""comedy"".Lenny is a Hollywood agent married to Roxanne, Eric is married to Donna, Kurt is a stay at home father and is married to Deanna, and Rob is married to Gloria despite the fact that Gloria is 30 years older then him. Lenny gets the news that their old basketball coach that led them to their one and only championships has had a heart attack and dies, he contacts all the guys to see how things are going, and to tell the about the news. The five men, along with their families, come to their hometown for the funeral. The families go to Lenny's lake house for the weekend, and reminisce about the good old days. Lenny is constantly insulted by the guys, making fun of him because he is a ""ugly Hollywood agent"". They make fun of Rob's wife, they make fun of Eric's obesity and breast feeding wife, they make fun of Kurt being ""Mr. Mom"", they make fun of their single alcoholic party friend Marcus. Lenny and Eric then take their kids to the water park, only to be mocked by the team they beat in the championship leading to another pointless game, they for some odd reason haven't gotten over the win that was how many years prior? Throw in some random family oriented problems that they skim over and that's how we get in Grown Up's.I had maybe three small laughs during this film, mainly coming from Steve Buscemi's performance. But seriously, the hurtful jokes were a bit much, they kept making fun of Kevin James' weight, Chris Rock's pride in being a stay at home dad, Rob Schneider's older wife. I can see one joke about it, but they constantly go on and on, making it ridicules and also makes you wonder how these guys are friends because my friends and I give each other a hard time, but not to the extent where it's almost 24-7. Then Sandler trying to throw in family oriented drama or love was so forced that it made me sick. He starts to have a little tiff with his wife and it's passed over within a second, making it completely pointless. This film was a waste of talent and money, it makes you wonder how these guys are ""real comedians"" that get a paycheck. Don't waste your money on this movie like I did, if you really wanted to see it, get together with your friends for a weekend and goof on each other, you saved 9 bucks. This was just a bad movie.2/10",Grown Ups
19,KineticSeoul,Just go camping,2,17 July 2013,"This movie just blows in every level. I am not quite sure if this is suppose to be adult comedy or a family flick. But everything about this movie falters or just mundane. This movie cost around 80 million dollars to make. And the budget probably went 15 to 20 million dollars to each of the main cast. It's basically a Adam Sandler movie but few other comedians around him but the jokes and how they interact seemed so fake, forced and mundane it falters. Watching this movie was like watching a bit more adult version of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" and it just doesn't work. The only thing that slightly stood out for me is Chris Rock acting like a very feminine man. This movie is basically a lame bonding movie with friends cracking uber lame jokes at one another. It's more fun just hanging with your real friends at some place while having a meal any day than sitting through this waste of time.

My stomach literally hurt – no, not from laughter.This abomination has almost zero plot; this hateful movie was just to get yesteryear's buffoons together, à la any rat pack movie and please forgive me for comparing these has-beens to the late and great 'pack. That said, I will try to summarize the movie just as quickly as they took to write it: boys play basketball, have a ""great coach"" who dies years later and the boys (notice: not MEN) reunite using that as an excuse to goof off, be mean and show off their not-so-trophy wives, kids and rented cars.That's pretty much it. That sums up the aimless ""comedic adventure."" After the six minutes it took them to write the outline (I'm assuming there was no actual screenplay) they chose follow that with incredibly lousy jokes that would beat any horse beyond recognition, terrible music that attempted to remind us of ""back in the day"" – bah, sporadic editing and an extremely absent director. The final result? Drop dead (if you think this is even remotely a) comedy.Sure, they looked like they were having a ball, and maybe that's where I got the Rat Pack reference, but they failed to make it even minutely interesting to us. There: I completed this without a single cuss word, but if this is what it means to grow up, I'm going to end it now. BANG.",Grown Ups
21,FeastMode,my notes,1,19 July 2019,"This movie started off decently. i was enjoying it for the most part. then it fell off a cliff. not only did the comedy become so lazy, sophomoric and slapstick, but they tried these ""feel-good"" moments with the kids and the couples that made my brain hurt from how cringe-worthy they were. i couldn't finish it. stopped with like 30 minutes left (1 viewing)",Grown Ups
22,Robert_duder,Really...did we expect more? I think it comes in under pretty standard.,6,21 August 2010,"Grown Ups is okay. Some even liked it a lot. A lot of IMDb reviewers sort of nailed it on the head when they called it predictable and formulaic and I think that's what this boils down to. Its very safe. I mean it doesn't take any great leaps in comedy, and it won't have you quoting funny lines for weeks although there are some decent ones...""I wanna get Chocolate wasted"" is a popular one around our workplace. I think Adam Sandler and his comedy troupe just really wanted a fun summer comedy without going blockbuster and really that is what they deliver but maybe we expect more from a collaboration of comics like this. There is not really a climatic moment where you're rolling in the aisles and there is just a huge ensemble cast and sure some might not be what some consider great comics but nonetheless the cast works well together and I think I just hoped for more. Perhaps they were more excited about getting a bunch of friends together then actually entertaining.Adam Sandler seems to tone down his leading man persona to play part of the cast. His doting Dad who wants nothing more than to teach his kids the love of being a normal kid. Sandler should be the leading man in the bunch and the comedy should rest squarely on his shoulders but it doesn't and his character has little depth. Kevin James returns to doing what he does best which is being Kevin James. I've never seen him do anything else. So the only thing I can say about his performance is if you like James...here he is...again. Much like Sandler Chris Rock seems to tone down his comedy so he doesn't overshadow anyone else. However, I must say he comes across this time as nearly boring and his character is the butt of his wife's and others jokes. David Spade is good and even less sarcastic than usual as womanizer Marcus. Rob Schneider rounds out the troupe being his usual self but he actually fits well into the cast. Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, Maya Rudolph, and Joyce Van Patten play the wives. Van Patten is probably the best of them, in fact gives the best of the laughs. The other three, well decent actresses, don't get a lot of depth and are mostly there just to be fillers to the family. Some of the best of the cast are those we barely see. They are the fleeting supporting cast including Tim Meadows, Colin Quinn, Steve Buscemi, and a great performance by Ebony Jo-Ann.This film is put together by the entire members of the Adam Sandler troupe that stick together. That includes director Dennis Dugan who has directed a host of Sandler pics for years. Having not particularly enjoyed many of his comedies especially Sandler's early silly slapstick comedies I can't speak overly highly of Grown Ups. Understand that it isn't a bad movie...it just...is. It's a little slow, and really doesn't impress or leave an impression at all. It is utterly forgettable but at the same time not a complete mess. Its a time waster and will probably entertain some mildly. 6/10",Grown Ups
23,MLDinTN,substandard for Adam Sandler,5,21 March 2011,"This movie had some laughs, but it was pretty silly and considering all the medians in it, it should have been funnier. The movie starts out showing 5 youths playing a basketball game against rivals. Jump ahead about 30 years, and we see the 5 of them today. They get word that their coach has passed away, so all return for the funeral. After that, they go to a rental lake house for the weekend. So, it the 5 guys and their wives and kids.Comedy tries to ensue. Such as meeting Rob Schneider's two hot daughters and then his 1 not so hot daughter. Plus he's got a grandma for a wife. Chirs Rock has his pregnant wife. Adam Sandler is a Hollywood agent with very spoiled children and a nanny. David Spade is the ever single ladies man. Kevin James tries to pretend to be a bigger success than he is and has a 4 year old still drinking mommy's milk. Through the weekend they have fun like going to a water park and meeting this really hot guy with a really annoying voice. Then the ending is another basketball game against their rivals from when they were kids.FINAL VERDICT: It has some laughs but should have been better. I'd say it's more for teenagers.",Grown Ups

Their idea of a fun different than what most people would expect.The acting is good. These actors always have been good entertainers. I liked the scenes between Rob Schneider and that old lady.

Their beloved coach took them to a swanky eatery to celebrate, when they were kids, and told them to live their lives meaningfully before the ""final"" buzzer sounded. But, now, as adults, the quintet may have forgotten his words. In Lenny's household, the two sons play video games and text the nanny for refreshments all day long while his wife (Salma Hayek) works on her fashion designs. Lenny, a top agent, is living the good life but can't get his kids to go outside, not even his lovely daughter. Word arrives that coach has died and, although Lenny and family were to travel to Milan, they postpone the trip by one day to attend the funeral. Meeting up with his former friends, Lenny finds that their lives are off-track, too. Eric has gained weight and has 2 bratty children, Kurt has become a house husband, Marcus drinks too much and chases skirt while Rob is married to a considerably older woman, his fourth go around. Changing plans, Lenny rents a huge loghouse to let everyone linger a few days together, ceremoniously scatter the coach's ashes and re-connect, children, too. From hikes to swims to ""paper cup phones"", this crowd is discovering what is important, right? It would be impossible not to laugh at the good moments of this film, which seems like a long improvisation by these experts of comedy. There are some great lines and funny situations, certainly. No, its probably not the most memorable film of the year but if a feel-good experience is needed, this one should fit the bill. The cast is stellar, with all of the major actors doing fine and funny work. For the most part, too, they seem to work as an ensemble, passing around the catch phrases nearly equally. This viewer, however, wished that Rock had had a few more lines but he certainly makes the most of what he was handed. Hayek, Maria Bello, Maya Rudolph, and Joyce Van Patten, as the leading ladies, support the men nicely. The scenery, from the lovely wooded home to the riverfront, is a joy and the costumes, camera-work, script and direction are above average as well. Yes, some of the humor is not appropriate for younger children so parents need to be cautious. Nevertheless, if you like Sandler, James, Rock, etc and/or you would welcome a chance to laugh with your loved ones, ante up and go see this flick soon.",Grown Ups

While it is aswarm in SNL alumni, Grown Ups is a solemn assembly of family-friendly, non- alcoholic jokes delivered by a collection of castrated comedies.In fact, this movie is an example of what happens when stand-up comedians don't die of an overdose or commit suicide early on in their career.

29,ironhorse_iv,This movie needs to grow up. It's so stupid.,5,21 July 2013,"I thought this movie was pretty dumb. Sorry, it was just silly and full of holes. This piece of garbage need the trashing it deserved. I have nothing against silly humor and have enjoyed some of the stupider films made by these actors, but this movie was just lazy. None of the characters seem like characters. It was watching the actors play as themselves with different names. With all these big names, the film directed by Dennis Dugan had great potential. But it just fell flat. This film remind me of another huge cast of comedian buddies movie. 2013's 'This is the End' works because it gave us a plot so out there that you can't help finding it funny. Both have a group of immature grown-ups that are mean-spirited and self-indulgent, but in 'This is the End', we see them punish for their answer. In 'Grown Ups', none of them go into any self-development. Why call the movie, 'Grown Ups' if none of bland, one dimensional unreliable characters truly grow more mature? If you going to keep the mean spirited humor, then why have slushy sentimentality? The movie is truly a bad version of 1983's the Big Chill. The plot is very similar to that. 'Grown ups' is about five friends who reunited for the Fourth of July holiday weekend in a camp after their junior high school basketball coach passes away. The story concept itself really had good potential, it could have been a smart comedy about childhood friends reuniting after all these years and catching up, having fun, being silly; you know, a comedy about something we could all relate to. Sadly I can't say most people can relate to them. First off, Adam Sandler plays an annoying over rich movie agent Lenny Feder marry to over the top hot woman Roxanne Chase (Salem Hayek) with spoil Paris Hilton like kids. The supporting characters are also just as annoying. Kevin James as Eric Lamonsoff was there for stupid fat jokes. I have to say Chris Rock as Kurt McKenize was under used, Rob Schneider was everybody favorite punching bag Rob Hilliard, mock because of his much older wife, and hot daughters is just a little more stupid than the others. Last is David Spade as Marcus Higgins in an unbelievable role as a womanizer and slacker who comes off as weak. Also to note, there is a lot of ex SNL cast members doing cameos in the film such as Tim Meadows, Norm Macdonald and Colin Quinn in this film. Then you got Steve Buscemi sports a cameo in the film. He look like Gollum from Lord of the Rings. He is so pale in the movie. I don't even see any of them as ex-basketball players. I don't even think they can even play basketball. Come to think of it, considering the group of people, and the theme of an old friend dying, they couldn't have come up with anything more emotionally affecting? Not like they had any real life events they could draw from. That is perplexing at best. But somewhere along that road it just took a nosedive into mediocrity. The amount of potential that was completely wasted here is mind-blowing. Jokes about potentially life-threatening injuries are still considered funny in Hollywood somehow. There is plenty of stupid slapstick humor, and prat falls to make any Jackass fan happy. Who in their right mind think arrow roulette is great idea? Other jokes fell flat to me too. I just turn off by the urinating, poop, and breast milk jokes. The worst had to be the animal getting hurt by the fat guy joke. Why are animals getting hurt a sign of humor? It's like dead baby humor, it's too dark for suppose family picture like this. If he going to have dark humor. Why can't we have some sophisticated dark humor? I have to say Big Daddy and 50 First Dates were decent so this movie could have been better. It felt like watching Adam Sandler hang out with his friends doing stupid stuff for an hour while somebody left the camera on. I know comedy movies such as this are suppose to be enjoyed, not ripped apart and analyzed. Critiques need to realize that it's entertainment, and as long as it is entertaining, it's might be a effective movie. Still, I wasn't entertain. Rather than watching this movie, I think people should just go outside and make their own friends, because watching this is just too lame. It's like watching a bunch of frats boys. A sequel indeed came out in 2013, titled 'Grown Ups 2'. Unfortunately it's worst then this movie. Sure if you look at it from a mature perspective it wasn't that great of a movie, but if you look at it from the immature, good sense of humor perspective, you might find it funny. I try to look at it immaturely, but the jokes weren't catching me. Like I said before, I found more humor in 'This is the End' then this. Unfortunately, supported to the end was the same - shallow atmosphere. Almost nothing was learned. The moral at the end was ""convex"" as the entire movie. I do not recommend, but it is worth watching, you want a stupid movie to watch. I saw it in theaters at the behest of a friend who enjoyed it, and went in with really low expectations, and if you set your standards low enough and turn off all brain function, the movie is actually watchable. If not, then you agree with my statements.",Grown Ups
30,The-Sarkologist,A Quite Amusing Feel-Good Movie,7,13 August 2020,"This is definitely one of those feel good movies, and a little different to a lot of the other Sandler movies that I have seen. In once sense it doesn't seem to follow that trope where we have a man-boy that is forced to grow up. Rather, we have a rather successful individual that comes to learn what it means to live the simple life.The movie is focused around a group of friends who won a basket ball game when they were in primary school. At the celebration dinner afterwards the coach, Coach Buzzer, told them to make the most of their lives. The movie then shifts to when they are adults, and they have drifted apart somewhat. Sandler has become a pretty successful Hollywood Agent however it turns out that the rest of the gang are really just living simple lives, though they are nowhere near as successful as Sandler.After the funeral, an arrangement has been made to go out to the lake, namely because that is where the coach wanted his ashes scattered. However, Sandler's wife has an appointment in Milan, and his kids are horrified that they have to spend time away from their games machine. Also, they drag the au pair along with them, but they don't want to make it obvious that she is a nanny, so they attempt to convince everybody that she is actually a foreign exchange student.Yeah, this film was actually quite amusing, but it also goes a long way to demonstrate the value of a simple life. It is interesting that it is really only Sandler's character that has actually become successful, the others certainly aren't in that category. One of them is a house husband, another is basically a stoner, and I won't give too much away regarding the other characters.Yet, oddly, it seems to be Sandler's character, and his family, that needs to come to terms with where they have gone. Milan sounds like a pretty good place to go for a holiday, but there is just this pining to remain at the lake with his friends. In fact, there is also that thing with the au pair, where he doesn't want to make it obvious that he has hired somebody to look after his kids.Once again, this seems to be one of those contradictory films that comes out of Hollywood. It promotes the idea of the simple life, but the actors in the film (some of them pretty big names, such as Chris Rock and Salma Hayek) certainly don't live simple lives. Sometimes I wonder whether they could actually learn a lot from what their films are saying, instead of going out at buying the entire cast a mazzarati because the film did so well.Oh, it is also one of those rather odd films that seems to defy the critics in that it is rated pretty poorly, but still managed to make a bucket load of money. Oh, and there are some pretty cool jokes in the film as well, particularly the one about getting wasted. Having the kids certainly did add a lot of charm to the film, especially some of the things that they managed to get up to.",Grown Ups
31,Floated2,it wasn't that bad yet wasn't that good,5,17 July 2010,"Grown Ups is just another Sandler and his buddies movie. It is simply about Sandler, James, Rock, Spade, and Scheinder hanging out and remembering their past. It starts out with the friends as kids at a basketball championship game, then fast forwards to the present day. This is where the characters come in to place, and where it starts. Then once the characters are introduced, they all get a message telling that their coach ""passed away"". So they take this news and decide to go to his funeral, then eventually spend and hang out at a beach house. A lot of critics slammed this one saying with all the comedic talent involved it should've brought more laughs. I guessed that's true but laughed a few especially some time towards the ending. To me this was like being at an actual cottage with these guys cause I believe the banter back and forth amongst them wasn't all scripted more brilliance to the film and maybe more of the laughs critics missed out on. For any fan of these guys. Though it felt kinda cheesy and seemed like it was filmed in a weekend or two, and they just put in the fun parts.

32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Classic Sandler humor falls flat without plot and too many ""family moments""",4,25 June 2010,"Adam Sandler's movies have almost always had a family element if they weren't a major part of the story (parental responsibility in 1999's ""Big Daddy,"" father-son relationship in ""Billy Madison"" and ""Little Nicky""). But lately, especially since the birth of his first daughter in 2006, it's begun to drastically shape his film choices. It started with ""Click"" in 2006, a story about appreciating family moments, and continued especially in 2008 when he teamed with Disney for ""Bedtime Stories."" The emotional sweetness of family life has been a major force in Sandler's work, but his patented insult and immature humor has not budged over that time. The latest result of that combination of family love and dirty adult humor is ""Grown Ups.""Despite pooling together the talents of long-time Sandler friends and collaborators Rob Schneider, Chris Rock, David Spade and Kevin James, ""Grown Ups"" is an aimless comedy that amounts to a string of recurring jokes and improvisational insult humor with a 50-50 success rate. One shouldn't expect much else from a Sandler movie, but it's the plot and attempt to be more family-centric that dampens the humor.The movie focuses on five old friends, each with some quirky character concept (Rock's a stay-at-home dad, Spade is a single man-whore, James is fat ...) who come together years later after the junior high basketball coach who led them to a state championship passes away. They spend the weekend together with all their families at a lake house and do various activities, some funny, some not.That about does it for plot, which ends up as the ultimate problem with ""Grown Ups."" Each character has a back story that influences how they behave and such and what they learn by the end of the film, but nothing pushes this movie along except the jokes that Sandler and co-writer Fred Wolf whip up. ""Grown Ups"" survives solely on serving up these jokes of all kinds from creative insults (""you look like a midget Elvis"") to physical humor (a few fart jokes and a couple kicks to the groin are examples). Their hope is that at least the majority will get laughs, which works well enough for the first hour, even though some of the recurring gags get sucked to death until they're completely dry, such as Maria Bello, who plays James' wife, breast-feeding her four- year-old son. If you enjoy Sandler's humor, the early barrage of jokes delivers enough decent laughs despite how contrived and even predictable his style has become.Interestingly, the family element looks like it could work toward the beginning: Sandler tries to convince his two boys to stop playing video games and texting and behaving like rich snobs, something recent movies seem to forget in their depiction of today's kids. Family drama and tender husband-wife moments wiggle their way into the story, but to no effective amount of conflict or resolution. All of it remains secondary to Sandler and his buddies clowning around together, even if the film's goal is to clearly balance the two. Unfortunately, it's the gushy family stuff that ends up weighing down the final act because the story climax falls on the sentimental side, not the humorous one. After all, when your movie is just a bunch of jokes and characters interacting with each other in attempt to amuse themselves, there's no obvious trajectory and no ""great"" ending that makes sense. As many of Sandler's films tend to do, the bottom of the movie drops out with barely a joke and these peripheral cameo characters such as Steve Buscemi are called upon to provide ineffective comic relief.""Grown Ups"" strives to be funny in that Happy Madison productions way, but also heartfelt and real in its depiction of family life. The objective is admirable, but if families hanging out and various members of them being completely wacko were entertaining in reality, we wouldn't need to go to the movies to watch a movie about that and nothing else -- we'd just do it ourselves.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Grown Ups

The other three main players are so-so; the female roles were superfluous. If this movie had confined itself to being a reunion between the Rob Schneider-David Spade characters, then this movie may have been great. The other players got in their way. The problem with this movie is that it tries to bite off more than it can chew, so has cinematic indigestion. Too many characters, too much schmaltz. Remember: Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy didn't need anyone else to be funny. The Three Stooges were not the five stooges. The same applies to Schneider and Spade. Team them up together, give them a goofy script, and they will be funny. Add in an ensemble cast and they will get lost in the crowd, which is what happens in this movie.

38,estebangonzalez10,A waste of a talented cast,5,19 July 2010,"¨We needed to be here. Our kids were turning into snotty, spoiled, little. This is what we needed. ¨ How can a film with so many talented comedians fail to deliver laughs? Grown Ups will only make you wonder more about this question because it is just one of those movies where talents go to waste. Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, and Robert Schneider all have had lead roles and one would assume that so much talent combined would result in a hilarious movie, but it wasn't the case because the material they had to work with wasn't any good. They probably had so much fun working together that they focused on enjoying themselves instead of trying to write a better story or smarter jokes. Not even the talented actresses such as Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, and Maya Rudolph helped improve the movie. This is just another one of those movies that relies so heavily on having a star cast that it forgets that there are other important elements to making a film. Great actors working together doesn't necessarily mean that you will have a great movie. Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf wrote the screenplay for this film and it is so sad to see them rely on old jokes. There is nothing fresh about this movie and you can predict most of the jokes that are going to be told. I think that all the focus of the movie was put on the cast that they forgot to find decent material to work with and that is the main problem with Dennis Dugan's film. Dugan has directed most of these actors in the past in You Don't Mess with the Zohan, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry, and The Benchwarmers.The plot centers on a group of friends from a high school basketball team who reunite after several years at their coach's funeral. Lenny (Adam Sandler) was the star of the team and is now a successful Hollywood agent. He is married to Roxanne (Salma Hayek), a fashion designer, and they have three kids. He is worried about his children who stay playing video games all day and on their cell phones. Eric (Kevin James) is a restaurant co-owner, or so he says, and he also has two children and is married to Sally (Maria Bello). They have a four year old son who still breast feeds. Kurt (Chris Rock) is a stay at home dad, living with his children, mother in law, and wife, Deanne (Maya Rudolph). Marcus (David Spade) is probably the most immature of the group and he is still single. And finally there is Rob (Rob Schneider) who is married to Gloria (Joyce Van Patten) a much older woman who could very well be his mother. After the funeral Lenny decides to rent the cabin where the team celebrated their championship for the Fourth of July holiday weekend. The five friends spend some time together with their wives and kids and learn some important lessons in the process.The plot is very poorly developed and this movie could have been so much better considering the cast, but it really fails by focusing on very lazy humor instead. It is like these guys were simply put together in the movie and let each one improvise. I am sure they had a great time making this movie, and had much more laughs than we did by watching it. Not even the supporting roles by Steve Buscemi, Tim Meadows, Colin Quinn, and Norm MacDonald were enough to save the movie. Grown Ups is just one of those movies where you have to grab your head and wonder how all this talent was put to waste. This just proves that having an all star cast doesn't mean you can make a decent movie and that it is important to have good writers mixed in the process. This was really a huge disappointment considering I am a true fan of most of these actors and have laughed hard at so many of their movies. Either the material they had to work with is getting worse or I am just getting older and not finding some of these men as funny as I used to. I am still waiting for a decent comedy to come out this year and put a smile to my face.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Grown Ups
39,mattkratz,not as bad as the reviews made it out to be-but still not great,8,22 July 2010,"I came to the theatres expecting to see a movie filled with a bunch of lame gags and the stars acting like a bunch of imbeciles and children, based on what I had heard from the reviews and previews. I had also seen the ""pee-in-the-pool"" scene in the previews, which grossed me out when I saw it then, and I was a little hesitant to see it. When I finally did see it, though, I didn't think it was as bad as it was made out to be. They didn't exactly act like that. I think the movie was reasonably funny, and I will admit there were some crude humor scenes, as you can expect from an Adam Sandler movie, and the PITP scene was minimal, as it turned out. I loved the rope scene, the water park scene (escpecially with the guy on steroids!), the climactic basketball scene, and most of Rob Schneider's scenes. It wasn't as good as it could have been and most of the potential for this material was wasted, but it was still pretty good. Not great, just pretty good. You might want to see it to get your own opinion. This was mine. Don't let the reviews think it was THAT bad.** out of ****",Grown Ups
40,davispittman,Kind of a Let down,5,14 March 2016,"Okay, I wasn't expecting a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. And I realize that Adam Sandler's career in the film industry has been on a big decline. His dwindling quality is partly displayed in Grown Ups. Sandler is alright I suppose, just OK. The rest of the cast isn't any different at all really, it's just kinda mediocre at best. The gags do get tired and worn. The reason grown ups is getting a 5/10 is because of some of the warmer heart felt moments, they weren't amazing, but they were pretty good. The comedy just gets so old and been there, done that. The film doesn't cover any new ground whatsoever. That's not always a bad thing, but it is in this case, because grown ups just recycles old used worn out jokes and mediocre gags to try to entertain and make the audience laugh. For me, this movie was just eh whatever, I'll never see it again, because there are movie movies I would much rather watch than this. 5/10 for 2010's Grown Ups.",Grown Ups

This one's a real mess. Terrible script, aimless ideas and situations scattered all over which don't amount to anything. There's potential in this ensemble, but it was a wasted opportunity. Even worse, what should have been a situation centered solely on the five guys and their male reunion is compromised by also featuring their wives and children, all of whom are even more boring than they are.

43,EUyeshima,Weakly Rambunctious Sandler Vehicle Comes Across as a Tepid Home Movie,3,23 March 2011,"""Droningly predictable"" is the only way I can describe this 2010 Adam Sandler cookie-cutter comedy with any clarity. Like the dehydrated banana that Sandler uses to hit Rob Schneider's face repeatedly, I felt a certain numbness sitting through the longest 102 minutes I can recall experiencing a movie at home. Working from a script co-written by Sandler and Fred Wolf, director Dennis Dugan, a longtime Sandler handler, appears to be going for a slapstick version of ""The Big Chill"" with a far more superficial sense of introspection. The story, such that it is, focuses on five elementary school buddies who gather over thirty years later for the funeral of their beloved basketball coach. With their families in tow, they turn the event into a weeklong reunion at a lakeside cabin in New England. At first, the sight of Sandler with his old SNL buddies Schneider, David Spade and Chris Rock, along with Kevin James (obviously filling in for the late Chris Farley), is encouraging given their genuinely funny ribbing of each other. I wouldn't be surprised to find out if they ad-libbed most of their lines in this scene.However, the film quickly degenerates into a standard, ""Yours, Mine & Ours""-level sitcom with heavy doses of sentimentality interspersed with goofball humor fluctuating between innocuous and tasteless. Sandler plays high-powered Hollywood agent Lenny Feder who is afraid his spoiled kids have lost touch with their humanity and the simple joys he enjoyed as a child like skipping stones. The other comics play stock roles - James as Eric, a failed lawn furniture salesman and the butt of all the mandatory fat jokes, Rock as Kurt, an emasculated, Food Network-obsessed househusband married to a career superwoman pregnant with their third child; Spade as Marcus, a womanizing horndog who refuses to settle down; and Schneider as Rob, a New age-spouting massage therapist married to a woman three decades his senior Each goes through a midlife crisis that requires some amount of personal humiliation before the power of their friendship kicks in. There are plenty of set-up scenes and sight gags that may produce a mild chuckle before the inevitable showdown with a rival basketball team.While it's good to see fellow SNL alumnus Maya Rudolph play Kurt's wife, it is something of a head-scratcher to see actresses of the caliber of Salma Hayek and Maria Bello take such flimsy parts in this production. Hayek plays Lenny's fashionista wife as if she's auditioning for Sofia Vergara's role in ""Modern Family"", while Bello is trivialized into a running sight gag constantly seen breastfeeding her character's four-year-old son. Familiar character actress Joyce Van Patten (Dick's sister and the director's ex-wife) has the most humiliating moments aggressively pursuing Schneider for sex. Steve Buscemi shows up late in the story as one of Lenny's hometown nemeses and ends up in a body cast for an extended sight gag. There is little else to say about the film except to say if you are not a die-hard fan of Sandler's, you should consider alternative entertainment. The 2011 DVD offers three short featurettes - two focused on the making-of aspects of the film and the third a gag reel. The Blu-Ray adds deleted scenes, a commentary track from Dugan with none of the principal actors participating, an Apatow-type blooper reel called a ""Riff-o-Rama"", and three additional shorts focusing on the behind-the-scenes details.",Grown Ups
44,TOMNEL,Five guys and their wives and kids crack unfunny jokes for an hour and a half.,3,24 April 2011,"Adam Sandler rarely makes a good movie, and if you see the ""Happy Madison"" logo in front of one of his films, it's almost assured that it's going to be a ridiculous picture. This was no exception. ""Grown Ups"" is an example of much of the worst elements of Sandler's films, all thrown into one movie, without any plot to hold it together. It's a sloppy mess of a film, that relies completely on the charisma of it's leading five funny men to hold it up, and while they are sporadically funny, they miss more than they hit. It's not as bad as ""Chuck and Larry"", but this is still a very bad Sandler film, and one of the lesser pictures of his.Normally I put the plot synopsis here, but this film has no plot. Five friends that all were in Jr. high together meet up again to attend their old coach's funeral. Then they all hang out in a cabin and make jokes. Then they spread the ashes and make jokes. Then they go to a restaurant and make jokes. Then they go to a water park and make jokes. They continue making jokes from set piece to set piece until the ending.Making bad jokes and getting no reaction from the audience is one thing, but making the bad joke, and then having your characters laugh at them like they're hilarious is another. Half the time somebody says something that's meant to amuse the audience, the other character's causally laugh at it. Now there's nothing wrong with characters having a good time, but they just laugh too much here. It's like the five leads provide a laugh track for the movie, along with their wives, kids, and basically any extra who happens to be in the scene. These are five ""funny"" men, and seeing Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, David Spade, Rob Schneider and Kevin James star in a movie together might make a Happy Madison fan pee themselves in delight, but these guys are just not given much funny to say. And the constant laughing from everyone just makes you realize more how irritating this thing actually is.Now onto what is particularly unfunny about this. Comparison and simile jokes are everywhere here. ""(BLANK) is as (BLANK) as a (BLANK)."" or ""He/she looks like a (BLANK) with a (BLANK)."" There must be at least 100 of these style of jokes in this thing. Maybe five were amusing...maybe. That's being somewhat generous. Going along with the comparisons are the puns. Chris Rock's mother-in-law has a huge swollen toe...Chris Rock refers to her as ""Toe-bo cop.""...wow that's funny? Next up in the joke department are a lot of crotch hits, face slaps and falls and whatnot. Again not funny. Occasionally an amusing joke squeezes through the junk and might get a chuckle out of someone, but overall these jokes are pretty bad.Conflict is needed to make a movie good even in comedies. The conflicts in this movie are 1)Sandler and Salma Hayek are angry at each other about a Milan fashion show, 2)The five guys have play a basketball game against some old rivals, 3)Sandler wants his kids to stop playing video games and to live. None of these have any large impact on the film, and they are usually resolved within ten minutes of being introduced. This thing has no large conflict, and is mainly just five people sitting around filmed in what looks like a beer commercial, cracking mean spirited jokes about one another. This could be potentially a funny film with all the talent involved, but very little works. Instead what we have is five people amusing themselves and leaving the audience wishing they could be on the same wavelength as these guys so they too could find this amusing. If anything positive could be said, at least the actors aren't too bad, and seem to be having a good time. I know I wasn't.My rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 102 mins. PG-13 for sexual and crude jokes, language and some violence.",Grown Ups

This is kind of like ""The Big Chill"" for the new generation. As five friends from a former basketball team go to honor their loving and fallen coach at his funeral. As they also have different lives. Adam is a successful agent but with spoiled three kids and a fashion-driven maker wife in Selma Hayek. David Spade is a Playboy! Rob Schneier is with a much older wife and a vegan-Buddhist guru like and has different daughters, with different marriages. Kevin James owns a lawn mower company and has a family, but not is all what it seems to be. Chris Rock is a put upon father and husband who does everything. But his pregnant wife, two kids, and funny but obnoxious mom living with them. There all of them get together for the weekend, in the cabin up in the woods that Adam Sandler's character rents. But while there, they find out what is important. How life is precious, learn to have fun, live together like it is your last day. And not take life for granted. Though it has some pretty gross but not all gross if you know what I mean, humor. Like men being boys and never wanting to grow up. In the process, the women and children learn something about themselves along with their spouses and fathers respectedly. If you are a SNL fan and a fan of Adam Sandler's this movie is for you.

It's almost as though they just sat around, off the clock, and had themselves filmed...with hangovers. They set up a series of easy jokes ranging from Kevin James' weight, to Rob Schneider dating an older woman. Each of the too many characters then makes a joke they may have stolen from the internet. The women are underused but a nice treat, with Bello and Hayek used for simple jokes. Bello still breast feeds her four year old son, can you imagine?!!? Chortle, chortle. A series of set pieces which show these guys past their prime. Cheung and Riley show up for some excellent, wonderful eye candy and a few cheap jokes as well. Rock has the least to do, but the most interesting and wasted part. His developing friendship with Sandler's nanny is quite sweet, but is kept at a distance to try and generate some form of suspicion. It is then completely explained in a few lines of dialogue.

Not only are the jokes weak and almost maddeningly predictable, the actors don't even get an actual story to work with. You can literally just erase main characters from this movie and it wouldn't affect the proceedings at all. Honestly, what does Chris Rock get to do in this movie? Can't remember a single one of his lines, really. The movie never really works up to a point, the characters have no goals, they just exist and you sit there and accept it.

49,Matt_Layden,A Missed Opportunity.,5,11 December 2010,"After their basketball coach dies, 5 friends get together at a cottage on a lake to remember him and the good old days. They bring their families along as well. Not much to say in regards to plot or story there. It seems that the funniest parts of this film, all happened behind the scenes. Going into Grown Ups, I got the nostalgic feeling, old buddies from the SNL days and stand up comedy are doing a flick together. Should be funny, since you have all these comedy 'heavy weights' together in one film. Too bad they had the cameras rolling during the wrong time.Grown Ups is chuckle funny, but should be gut busting funny. That's the problem with this film. It seems that the guys just seemed to be hanging out and having a good time. That's great and all, but we aren't apart of it. Sandler, without a doubt, decided he wanted to hang out with his friends and get paid to do it. Then one day they thought they should go to the water park and have even more fun while they get paid...and they did.Another set back is that the film is kid friendly. You're taking funny man Chris Rock out of his element right away, and it showed. Kevin James, as funny as he is, will never replace Chris Farley. I still prefer the physical comedy of Farley over James. Schneider plays the weirdo of the group, that they like to pick on. He is stuck again as the sidekick, even in the this ensemble piece. David Spade plays his crude self and of course Sandler is playing the kid friendly version of himself. Most of the stuff is improvised, they even keep all the scenes where they laugh at each other. It's all good an fun, but most of it isn't that funny. Spade walking out of a closet dreaming he did stuff with a short blonde, then moments later having the dog walk out, is not funny. The funny men have their families with them. Their wives, all of them out of their respect husband's league. Yes, even the grandma/wife. The kids, most of them are annoying (Sandler's kids) which I guess was the point, but even after they accepted the awesomness of playing outside, I still despised them. The film has no real plot, as I mentioned, it's just the guys hanging out and having fun. You'll get a few laughs here and there, but every single one of these guys have been in something funnier.",Grown Ups
50,bob-rutzel-1,"Bland, Weak Story",2,18 November 2010,"The boys that won a championship for their coach back in the day attend his funeral 30-years later. Then they go with their families to a cabin in the woods for picnic outing so to speak. I think the idea of this story was to show the kids of today that the now grownups had fun back in the day without all the technology that is available to their kids today. But, that fizzled and we just saw one picnic event after another where all participated and their were no realizations by the kids that they could have fun without all the technology available to them. It was just one event after another where 5-comedians try to verbally outduel each other, and none had any lines worth remembering. So in essence, this was all bland with one ""we've seen it before"" sight gag after another. Some worked, most did not, but still not much was funny. The only funny event, for me, was when Kevin James' character is in the pool and is warned by his kid not to pee in the pool as the water will turn a deep blue because of a certain chemical put into the pool. He says he is not going to do that, but we all see the deep blue expanding in the pool around him. And, to add insult to injury we see more deep blue colors around the other adults in the pool too. Got to admit, it was funny. Not nice, but funny. There was one event I really hope kids (or adults) who see this movie do not imitate. That is Arrow Roulette. Someone shoots an arrow up into the sky and it can come down on someone and actually kill that person. Here the arrow comes down and pierces someone's foot. And, this is funny, why? Remember the movie, The Mexican, where the whole town is shooting guns into the air and one bullet comes down on someone and kills him? There should be more responsibility with these things whether they be arrows or guns. See? Adam Sandler should be ashamed of what he allowed in this movie (he was one of the writers).The teachable moments were lost on the kids. Were there too many beans in the pot? Too many comedians I mean? No, it was a weak script with a lack of purpose after the beginning of what this was supposed to be. The script forgot about the kids. The Grownups really weren't that at all. The comedians (term used loosely) just had a ball with themselves. I thought I knew the purpose of the story but apparently, I was wrong.

51,bkrauser-81-311064,Grow Up Already!,5,10 January 2014,"I'm not part of the Adam Sandler hater group; it's one of the ways I show my generational stripes. I grew up on Happy Gilmore (1996), The Waterboy (1998) and Big Daddy (1999) and despite some faults; I actually enjoyed watching You Don't Mess with the Zohan (2008). It's crude low-brow humor and if humor is subjective I'm going to have to differ to the crowd in respects to Sandler.Yet regardless of my casual acknowledgement of the former SNL member's funniness, Grown Ups is not Happy Gilmore. It's not even Little Nicky (2000); at least that movie dared to put the known universe in its hands. Grown Ups focuses on a grounded premise, with boring conflicts, to deliver a dead film with nothing to offer. The fact that it offers the comic styling of David Spade, Kevin James, Chris Rock and that guy from The Animal (2001) and does nothing with them is an added shame.If Grown Ups involved the aforementioned comedians in a room together doing stupid things for 90 minutes I actually would have been fine with it but instead they decided they wanted to create ""characters"" for themselves resulting in David Spade playing the least convincing ladies man on earth and me face palming at Chris Rock's stay at home dad schtick. The only person I might believe in character would be Sandler a la Punch-Drunk Love (2002) but instead he plays a Hollywood insider with a mansion and a live-in maid. Big stretch there Dink.There are conflicts throughout the film in the classical definition of the word. Kevin James's character is hiding the fact he's unemployed by overcompensating (oh wait that wasn't revealed to the audience until the end). David Spade's character has a drinking problem (addressed but never resolved). Oh yeah, there's also something about a basketball rematch between another group of aging men who never grew up consisting of Colin Quinn and Happy Madison regular Steve Buscemi. That happens, in the film's climax, I guess.Despite the film juggling a truckload of cliché conflicts, there is no tension or sense of the stakes. Everyone is just so blasé about everything that by the time the big game rolls around, I'm less interested in the characters and more interested in where the matching jerseys came from considering they just agreed to play is by the spur of the moment. With a little extra polish and perhaps a few trimmings and add-ins here and there this film could have been this generation's Parenthood (1989) but instead settles to be a Cheaper By the Dozen 2 (2005) retread.And speaking of parents; almost all of the main characters are, in fact parents and are married with wives! Wives who for the most part are treated derisively with Oscar nominee Salma Hayek getting the brunt of the she-devil trope we come to expect in a boys-club comedy. Also getting lampooned for playing their characters convincingly are Golden Globe nominated actress Maria Bello, Emmy nominee Maya Rudolph and veteran stage actress Joyce Van Patten.So let's just say Grown Ups failed as a story and as a character piece. But just as The Expendables (2010) was about aged action stars doing their thing, Grown Ups is about a bunch of aging comedians doing theirs. So the bottom line; is it funny. The answer is a resoundingkinda. It's sporadically funny at certain moments, most of which were in the trailer. Much of the friends' ragging and japing is funny if you don't consider they should be in character. But when all is said and done and the last Voss has been spilled, it's scary to think the funniest thing about this movie is Rob Schneider.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Grown Ups
52,moviexclusive,There isn't much 'Grown-Up' charm for a movie called Grown Ups,4,29 August 2010,"There were two main attractions that lured this reviewer to watch Grown Ups. The first being the possibility of looking into a crystal ball – to get an idea how he and his buddies might look like many years down the road from now when we have all had children. The second would be that any Adam Sandler movie is a guaranteed hit. The verdict? Let's say that both attractions turned out to be major duds.The movie introduces us to the five friends as little league basketball players. The motley crew is led by Adam Sandler and consists of Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider. Together with their coach, the team successfully clinches the 1978 championship. Fast forward thirty years later, they boys have all moved on with their lives but their coach brings them together one more time when they all return to their hometown for his funeral. In doing so, they also plan to have a great big family outing at a lake house to celebrate Fourth of July.In truth, the prospect of these comedians getting together should be like Stallone assembling his Expendables team but the team up works for a bit and then it crashes tremendously. The really funny jokes were a rarity, the mediocre ones were scattered throughout while the fall flat on their faces ones, plentiful. While the comedic team ups would have worked at a smaller scale (ie. Sandler and James in Chuck and Larry), in here there is not much believability that these people actually spent a good chunk of their lives together and this is further extended to the different relationships too. Salma Hayek in a comedy is something but she and Sandler are just not funny together. Even the reliable Maya Rudolph of Saturday Night Live fame cannot keep things together opposite Chris Rock.Somehow, it felt that the script was trashed out in double quick time with a paint-by-numbers guide, with no effort whatsoever to be different. As a matter of fact, it seems that the actors themselves could have used this opportunity to have a bit of a break themselves. The one highlight though would have to be how disconnected children these days are from the real world. With the over-reliance on technology and staying inside, there are those who are clueless when placed on an open patch of sprawling green. The children's discovery of the best things in life serves up as the only memorable piece to this movie.This movie ranks up there with You Don't Mess With the Zohan, the other Adam Sandler movie in recent times that has been so bad. It is also no surprise then that audiences in the States did not warm up as comfortably to this movie. Wait for the DVD or for it to appear on cable. www.moviexclusive.com",Grown Ups

The movie concerns five friends who come together for the funeral of their old basketball coach, a much liked man played briefly by Blake Clark who touched their lives, but the movie works best when it leaves the plot and the guys start firing lines at each other or just generally trying to get under each other's skin. The best recurring gags involve their kids who are so jaded that their fathers were once kids (two of whom are future Disney stars) and Ron's wife who looks old enough to have dated Moses. One of the kids only drinks expensive bottled water, one has continued breast feeding way past the cut-off date and several gags involve Schneider fathering two VERY hot daughters and a third that looks so much like him that you'd think its Schneider playing another character.

Both Cynical And Sort Of Sweet.,7,15 November 2010,"i can't complain. this was a free rental. i thought it was funny. but i happen to like Dennis Dugan and all these actors.i also think movies that portray people as lunkheads are amusing and sort of insightful. i mean people are lunkheads. especially in this country. and i'm not just calling names, i include myself in this. America has always had a sort of sweet, naive, lunkheaded earnestness that i always think is funny. as long as it doesn't lead us to far astray, there's something frank and honest about it.everybody in this movie including the kids are basically idiots. when Adam Sandler talks about being with his friends who he describes as ""average, normal folks"", the one wife seems surprised and adds, ""are we normal?"". the disturbing answer is probably yes. nobody's perfect right?of course this movie is silly. what Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade movie isn't? anyone who watches a movie with these comedians and doesn't know or expect that, is even more knuckle-headed than the characters in the film. and anyone who thinks this should have somehow been better is unrealistic and giving this too much thought.i wouldn't say this movie is the cynical all-American classic that the original 'National Lampoon's Vacation' was, but it was cute, gross at times, but kind of sweet and cute and funny.",Grown Ups

Grown ups is one flawed film. But I won't deny: It's kind of fun. It has it's flaws, but in some way works.There is no real plot here. All it is is a group of old friends(played by Adam Sandler and all of the above) who go for a funeral of their old basketball coach. And yada yada yada you know where it goes.The movie isn't that bad. It's flawed though. Some of the laughs are a miss. You can really tell where the plot is going. It's kind of corny. But yet, at the same time, I am kind of recommending it. I'll tell you why. Just wait.I did laugh more than I expected to. I wanted to hate this movie. But I didn't. Also, I like the supporting cast more than the main cast. I love Maya Rudolph as Chris Rock's wife.Always have,ever since Idiocracy. She's hilarious.Salma Hayak is also delightful as Sandler's wife and is still hot for her age. I also like Maria Bello as James' wife. She hasn't been in much. I even liked it her The Mummy 3, which everyone else hates but me. I also appreciated seeing some of these actors together. I mainly appreciated Colin Quin's role. Cause I haven't seen him in a while. Grown ups, with it's flaws and lack of originality, still works.

It just goes to show, not everyone likes the same things, and that's okay. I laughed throughout - almost like I was there with them.When the beloved coach of their childhood champion basketball team passes away, 5 friends since youth come together with their families for the funeral. Each of them having taken very different roads to end up in different jobs and financial statuses. But, all of them still share the same background, same basic sense of humor and similar family problems. They're friends, and even after all these years, they don't miss a beat.This isn't one of Adam Sandler's best movies, but it is one of his most down-to-earth and casual films. It really is like old friends hanging out together, joking around and having fun. It is this kind of humor, the kind you have when you're with your best friends and just enjoying the time together. On the strength of this comedy type is where this movie excels. It handles most of the subject matter realistically, with some over-the-top moments - ie: the breast pump scenes, and the hanging by your feet from a zip line at the water park (which, of course, they would never let you do), but that just adds to the overall feel. The various family dynamics are entertaining - for example, between Kurt McKenzie (Chris Rock) and his mother-in-law. And each actor brings his own brand of humor effectively to the screen.I had a fun time with this movie - I've already seen it more than once and am sure to watch it again.

68,Rickting,Truly and intense harrowing,2,17 April 2014,"In this Sandler comedy vehicle, a group of old friends played by a group of successful comedy veterans go to a lake-house with their families and reunite after their old basketball coach dies and act really, really immature for their age. That's it. No seriously, that is actually it. No character development, no consequences, no ending, no substance and no structure. Just 5 repulsive men, played by inexplicably popular comedians, staying by a lake and mucking about. I want to add that I'm not its target audience and Sandler die hards will likely enjoy it. I did laugh a couple of times and there is a relentlessly light and silly tone which for some, will be comedy gold. For me? A relentless nightmare. There is no plot. Most films have 3 acts. This is a first act stretched to 100 minutes, with nothing really happening. Watching Grown Ups is like waiting in line for a theme park ride for 2 hours and the ride then breaking down when you're about to get on it. How does the film end? At some sort of party, someone gets shot in the foot and the movie ends. No-one learned anything. No-one rediscovered anything. There was no point.With the exception of Chris Rock, the comedy veterans (especially Kevin James) are awful, with Dennis Dugan once again proving himself a thoroughly unimaginative director. None of the characters are likable, and the film is nothing more than an excuse to get its stars in the same movie. They weren't interested in plot, character or any kind of maturity. The script is heartbreakingly immature and simply isn't funny. It's also incredibly lazy, as entire set pieces consist of old ladies farting, Kevin James swinging into trees and repeatedly urinating in public swimming areas, the characters being sexist, Adam Sandler trying to pretend a bug zapper isn't zapping bugs and the main characters (who we're supposed to like even though they're being sexist, rude or immature (frequently all at the same time) for the entire movie beating each other up and insulting each other. Grown Ups was supposed to be a comedy. Sadly, screenwriters Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf were unable to work out that what they were writing was about as funny as 12 Years A Slave. Somehow, despite the fact it is a comedy bomb on nearly every level, it still made $271 million worldwide.2/10",Grown Ups

There is absolutely nothing to recommend this pile of crap. How they got anyone to bankroll such a weak concept and rubbish script is beyond me. I have not managed to even crack a smile yet.

72,scottshak_111,Amazing quality humor,7,17 August 2010,Adam Sandler wove a lovely story in the Grown ups. Though the movie had not much to offer but the story was really lovely and totally enjoyable. I had a great time watching the movie as Adam didn't leave any stone unturned. He carried it well as he always does in his all movies. As an amazing comedian he came up with great punches and I had a great time enjoying the comedy.The movie also showed some great moments where despite of the little ups and downs in a relationship 'Love and truth still rules' was also given precedence.There is something about Adam Sandler that really gives comedy a new dimension.His humor is the best- the way he comes at one after a let down is a joy to watch. If you want some best come back lines then start watching how Sandler does it. Kevin James on the other hand is the funniest actor alive. His acts really could possibly bring back even the dead.He is damn funny when he dances with his unique style which we have so far seen in his previous movies be it be Paul Blart or The hitch. Rob Schneider and Chris Rock and David Spade were at their best. Rob had a thing for the oldies. The concept was really catchy coz each one of them were 'normal' as Adam said. I was really looking forward to watching this movie and I don't regret it. The humor was unlike all the stupid movies and it had a lot of HAHA moments in it. I'd recommend this movie to everyone as in this case Too many cooks didn't spoil the food.,Grown Ups
73,Jackpollins,Surprisingly funny stuff,7,29 June 2010,"Grown Ups is the story of five childhood friends who meet up for the first time in 30 years to celebrate the passing of their basketball coach. If this reminds you of the 1988 Louie Anderson comedy The Wrong Guys, then I don't blame you. That said, this is a very funny movie, much to my great surprise. The cast is terrific, including Kevin James, Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, David Spade, Mario Bello, Maya Rudolph, Salma Hayek, and Chris Rock. Yes, this is a (mostly) SNL reunion. Chris Rock, however gets the short end of the stick, getting the stereotypical supposedly gay character that everyone's come to know and hate. With the exception of Schneider, who's been in some funny stuff but has not been himself funny, we all know these are funny people, and they show it here. The chemistry between all the friends is there. You can really tell that these people are all friends. Sure, they (hilariously) insult each other, and they act like they have something against each other, but you know down deep in the pit of their stomach they really like each other. We get a surprisingly little amount of fat jokes from James, and Sandler doesn't play it one note like he usually does. This is what makes Grown Ups surprisingly funny, the fact that these comedians are allowed to be funny without being their stereotypical characters the film makers could of easily made them. Overall, Grown Ups is worth a trip to the theater, but not as easily as some other stuff.",Grown Ups
74,bluesman-20,Fun movie It's a comedy don't make more of it then you should.,10,22 July 2010,Grown ups is a fun and relaxing comedy. I took my wife to see it and we both greatly enjoyed it. Now people may complain about this or that but if they do they miss the point the movie is trying to make. 1978 a group of friends playing basketball win the big Championship and the coach as a reward rents a beautiful cabin for all of them and their families to enjoy. The Coach makes a speech about how they should all approach life like they did this game and they will be winners champions with no regrets. flash forward 30 years later and each of them receives a phone call the coach is dead. They decide to rent the cabin and hold a reunion bringing their families with them and to try to introduce them to the magic of their childhood years and teenage years. Adam Sandler is a wealthy high powered Hollywood agent who just wants his kids to grow up to be normal and not spoiled. Chris Rock is a henpecked house husband who gets no respect from his business woman wife or his kids or his mother in law. Kevin James is a typical dad with a wife and kids and a weight problem his wife still breast feeds their 4 year old son and the magic has gone out of their life. Rob Schneider is a dramatic love them and leave them man except he loves the older ladies. David Spade is the single guy here and he's the drunken party animal. All of them have secrets and all of them feel like failures in one way or the other. But by the time this weekend is over secrets are revealed and friendships are restored and marriages are given back their magic. this movie does not promise the earth moon and the stars All it wants is for you to relax shut your brain off and park your worries in the lobby. It's not a laugh every scene or a laugh riot but it does have laughs and it is a nice lazy relaxing movie that we all need once in a while. I loved this movie and recommend it for what it is.

75,rollernerd,SNL Reunion,6,28 October 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is the comedy flick Grown Ups (2010) where we see Sandman and his SNL alumni pals including Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider play as high school mates who reunite together in their home town after their basketball coach passes away. They bring their families and rekindle their friendship during the Fourth of July holiday weekend. This is a down-right family friendly flick with heaps of gags and good banter amongst the friends. However, the gag with the kid still getting breastfed and the grandma farting was good at the first two times and should have been left there. The shooting the arrow up in the sky and James and the Sandman picking on Spade while he was sleeping were great. Aside from the comedy, we do see an awesome water park scene and the Sandman's basketball skills. Like with most of Sandler's films always come with a message which is today's kids are to disconnected and too spoilt. The movie reflects heaps around kids should just go outside to play, go for a swim and run amuck. The divergent comedic styles of Sandler, James, Rock, Spade, and Schneider come together and show us how great they are with their improvisations. There are some great lines and funny scenes. No, it's not the best memorable film but still gave me a few laughs. Overall, a solid family comedy with slap stick moments 6/10",Grown Ups
76,raisleygordon,Not as funny as I hoped,5,7 September 2010,"Bringing SNL alumni together (with Kevin James) is ideal for a movie. Unfortunately, the film is short on laughs. And it doesn't really take off. Another problem: Do we really need to see the wives and children of these five men? They don't add any funny material to the movie, and are not necessary, at least not as leads. Well, if they are supporting characters, they're not limited nearly enough. The reason and place for this get-together, I have no problem with. But if these 5 men were by themselves most of the time, with everyone else in only portions of the movie, then this might have gone somewhere. From the director of Big Daddy and Happy Gilmore, I expected more. One scene I enjoyed was when these people were at the water park. Everything else is mediocre at best. If the movie is trying to be the usual gross-out comedy, it's not trying hard enough. If it's trying something new, it's not trying hard enough. ""Grown-Ups"" seems to be more interested in being clever than funny. This might be much more funny as an SNL skit, but as feature-length, there's either too little or too much effort.**1/2 out of ****",Grown Ups

83,mrcibubur,another stereotyped comedy which was barely funny,5,27 September 2010,"This was actually quite an entertaining movie as a sort of take on American life but never a million years was it funny except perhaps for the opening scenes. It is extraordinary that Adam Sandler deludes himself in believing that movies such as this and 'Funny People' are in any way funny because it is light years away from public expectation of a comedy. As pure drama, I find the movie entertaining for the pure concept of a story that a group of young men who played basketball together at school meet with their families many (30) years) LATER on a 4th July weekend. there is a fakeness to the characters and the lives which they seem to lead and apart from the very opening scene, the movie has nothing to do with basketball at all.Adam Sandler is involved with the screenplay and directing and a real opportunity has surely been missed to tell a really good down to earth 'grown ups' drama. Not all movies work as a comedy and it is time the talented Mr Sandler looked beyond these limitations to show those talents in a more versatile way. Maybe he does not want to and we will get more of these 'contrived' movies thrust at us year by day.this is a 'no brainer' movie for sure, there are too many offending and awful one liners, dialogue is lacking and even action to cause us to laugh at something is minimal; after the fat guy on he rope hit the tree pretty early on, that was pretty much it for me.Its a safe family film and it wont offend anyone watching it despite several innuendos such as 'swimming' and 'wasted' among others and the four year old child breastfeeding is an unnecessary sub-story.At the end of the day, we should remember the coach who died who brought the guys together and not the guys themselves and their families.

To me this was like being at an actual cottage with these guys cause i believe the banter back and forth amongst them wasn't all scripted. I love Kevin James and Adam Sandler together. Any projects that they are both involved in usually = hilarity.

85,Fields201,I was reunited with someone after eighteen years seeing this,8,29 June 2010,"The first day seeing this girl after eighteen years, we went to see this movie. I thought it was a good movie to see since we hadn't seen each other since we were kids and this movie follows something along that line.By the time the movie was finished, I remarked to her, ""Happy Gilmore is better."" And she remarked, ""It wasn't Adam Sandler's best movie."" Luckily, the movie wasn't devoid of any comedic moments. There is. There are a lot laugh out loud parts to the movie like how they make fun of each other or Kevin James falling over something. It's in the third act where I realized that this movie seems composed of scene after scene and how it almost tries to force you to love these characters.And to me, that was the selling point of this movie. It was finding a way to put Adam Sandler, David Spade, Kevin James, Chris Rock, and Rob Schneider all in the same movie. Oh, and give Adam Sandler another hot wife (Salma Hayek). Since this is a summer movie, they threw them into a summer resort. And hey, let's revert back to Happy Gilmore days and throw in a sport. Haven't tried basketball yet. There we go! Throw that and some gags and we got a movie! And this falls into what I said before, scene after scene. You are just going from one scene to the next without a real focus to what their motivations are. There really isn't any from what I saw.Despite all that, I seen worse and there were some funny moments in the movie that merit a watch.

This movie is more of the same Sandler with each character basically playing themselves with no real development at all. The film never has any cohesiveness and always feels like a bunch of friends wrote a movie and invited more friends to help. I won't even get into the story because it is so simple and contrived it's not worth mentioning.

It's pure non serious humor, yet presented in a very straight and salty manner at the same time has a message embedded. Just like the 'Click' and the 'Funny People', 'Grown Ups' does make you think about one or two realities of life.Five good friends from school days re unite after their Basketball coach passing away in their home town. Having way different lives from who they actually wanted to be and bundled with certain regrets and joys the gang along with their families set to spend the holiday weekend on a known place from their childhood. The story is about how they fix in and as fathers how they try to keep the balance between their kids, wives and most of all the friendship. The events which happens on the two day stay is well constructed and humorously packed and keeps the viewer intact. Thought the plot is not complicated and out of the ordinary some scene may seems familiar and will make you wonder of your life and how things change.'Grown Ups' is a good movie.

90,Bravesfan17,A fun movie for Adam Sandler fans,8,2 July 2010,"Grown Ups marks the fifth collaboration between director Dennis Dugan and actor Adam Sandler. Not only that, but there is also an all star cast that contains Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, and Rob Schneider.All 5 of them show how hilarious they are and how great the chemistry is among them. They all have their moments and have good jokes within the script.The movie starts with the main 5 actors as younger kids in middle school playing in a basketball championship, which they ended up winning on the final play. The story then transitions to 30 years later where their beloved coach (played by Blake Clark, one of Sandler's friends and frequent collaborators) has passed on.After the funeral, the main guys decide to go to their old lake house and spend some time there together. The story then focuses on them rekindling their friendships and getting their kids to spend their time the same way their parents did at that age.Along with the main 5 actors comes wives. Salma Hayek plays Sandler's wife, Maria Bello plays James's wife, and Maya Rudolph as Rock's wife. They are all very funny in their parts and have some great moments to be funny.Grown Ups is definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of Adam Sandler or any of these actors. It is full of fun and laughs. There are times when it feels like director Dennis Dugan is trying to have his actor force lines or force part of the story, but he makes up for it with the laughs that come within other parts of the story.",Grown Ups
91,Jonathon_Natsis,"Childish, but I never expected any better",4,2 February 2011,"What would be a befitting summer comedy in the United States is actually a somewhat out- of-place winter comedy upon hitting Australian shores, awkwardly wedged between higher- profile comedies (Get Him To The Greek, Toy Story 3) and cash-cow monsters (The A-Team, Twilight: Eclipse). Still, it complies with the formula for commercial success in this genre fairly stringently: easily-identifiable cast, light on plot and an uncomplicated ending wrapping up the film's events in a neat little package.Adam Sandler leads the rest of the frat pack in Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider (of course, it's a Sandler film!) who gather their respective families for a weekend away at the guys' favourite retreat after they reunite at the funeral of their high school basketball coach. Instead of being a film about dissecting the differences in each man's life since losing contact with each other (with some well-scripted comedy thrown in for some light-hearted entertainment), it dosen't really have much a plot in hindsight. I'm not implying that that's what I expected out of Grown Ups, but it would have been a refreshing surprise nonetheless.Rather, the film just seems to jump from gag to gag, often recycling the same material introduced in the first fifteen minutes, and lazily applying it to different situations. The slapstick is about as funny as slapstick can get in modern cinemaif applied with a bit of thought behind the set-up, it can leave you with tears of laughter. But the biggest buzzkill to the laughs that could be generated out of slapstick is predictability. We know James will hit that tree, we know Buscemi will run into the house, we know Hayek will accidentally peg that rock into her son's gut while trying to skip it across the lake. You get the idea.Any other form of comedy used pretty much misses the mark on all fronts. Visual gags (particularly those involving Schneider and his family) become very tired very quickly, and the interplay between the characters feels forced and undeniably cliché, which is disappointing considering these are supposed to be a bunch of guys who've known each other for their entire childhood. If I had to find one benefit out of Grown Ups, it would be David Spade's performance. By no means mind-blowing, the life-loving, heavy-drinking bachelor he plays is given the best one-liners of the film, and his natural delivery and tone make him the only truly believable character. In fact, this individual was the only one that actually benefited from a lack of character development, allowing him to play his part with comfort and flowing simplicity.While appearing as something of a waste of time to those of us who take our films seriously (high on drama, emotion and purpose), Grown Ups is, at its core, an inoffensive movie targeted towards no specific market. It dosen't contain any single element of filmmaking that completely destroys the experience. Instead, it stumbles on a multitude of minor points that would have otherwise made it more engaging. *There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

95,DanLives1980,Fantastic family comedy!,8,10 August 2013,"I can't imagine that a lot of serious comedy fans anticipated this movie at first, given the cast of great comedy actors that weren't having the best of luck at the time! The great news is that Grown Ups, is old-school awesome, with a story right from several classics that made many a Saturday Night Live legend a comedy movie legend.Five friends - Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider and... holy crap, David Spade??? hear of the news that the man that influenced their childhoods the most, their basketball coach, has passed away.After the funeral, they drag their families to a lakeside resort to relive old times, only to discover why they're not what they thought they'd turn out like and to do something about it.For a family comedy, it's pretty damn hilariously rude at times, but what I love so much about it is the chemistry and camaraderie between the leads.The dialogue is the backbone of about 50% of the movie, consisting of Sandler, James, Rock, Schneider and Spade seriously insulting each other while acting like old has-beens. It was very well written and I couldn't help but laugh out loud throughout, which I'm not used to.The other 50%? Well that consists of belly-laugh inducing stunts, great cameos from the likes of Steve Buscemi and Tim Meadows and some seriously cringe-worthy laughs from wives Salma Hayek (rawrr), Maria Bello (rawrr), Maya Rudolph (huh???) and Joyce Van Patten (blerrghh).If you don't like it, I'm betting you still can't hate it. As much as this is nowhere near a Sandler comeback vehicle, he does get to shine in his old ways sometimes and director Dennis Dugan (Happy Gilmore, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry) injects classic silliness into the movie as much as possible.Each actor does what he does best here but I felt that - good for him, he really deserves better - Kevin James shone brightest with the verbal and physical comedy.I seriously look forward to the sequel!",Grown Ups
96,LiveLoveLead,Crude Rude and Immature!,3,28 December 2012,"Truth be told, it did have some funny stuff and even some endearing parts, but mostly it was over-the-top, stupid humor. Everything with Rob Schneider and the characters that played the childhood rivals was horrible. Rob Schneider's character was lame, and the stuff with his ""sexy"" daughters was just to add some ""cleavage"" to the movie. My 13 year old nephew and his friends loved this movie because it's corny with cheesy humor and some sexual innuendo(immature). But it really isn't for kids. It has a lot of crude humor and suggestive material along with language that really isn't appropriate for kids in my Humble Opinion.6/2011",Grown Ups
97,MovieProductions,"To be honest, it wasn't bad, but it's still leagues away from being good",5,30 June 2010,"** out of (****) ""Grown Ups"" is that typical summer comedy that couldn't be more predictable, more formulaic, or more unoriginal then it is. It also has that by-the-numbers pattern of raunchy humor, thrown in with some childish jokes, and then the inevitable ""feel good"" vibe. In ""Grown Up's"" defense, that's actually a complement. It isn't as awful as one would expect because it's so cliché that it possibly cannot be a disappointment. However, it is still far away from being a good movie because of how familiar it seems. ""Grown Ups"" revolves around a bunch of buddies that reunite when they find out that their basketball coach has passed away. Now these men have grown up and decide to venture out on a nice vacation and stay at a cabin. Yep, that pretty much sums up the plot. It can't get more paper-thin then that right? It's kind of hard to nitpick this movie and to compile a list of positives because for everything that's bad about this movie it's good, and everything that's good about this movie, it's bad. Although, I'll give it my best shot. For a redeeming quality, the movie is pretty entertaining. Your mind won't wander throughout and it's not nearly half as bad as most would expect. Moreover, the performances aren't too shabby either. And actually, the characters are pretty likable, but still are pretty two-dimensional. Moreover, this movie does have its moments. I'm not saying it's humorous, but it sure does have some slightly funny times. Now onto the negatives. I thought that movie had wasted potential. The more mature jokes had a lot more depth and the pay-off was very good. The more childish humor had no substance and just came off very dry. Sadly, the route the movie mostly took was the childish aspect and the formulaic stereotypical jokes. *sigh*. Moreover, I thought the dialog was just awful. I mean, who speaks like that? So nonsensical. Furthermore, I thought the whole movie was pointless. I mean if you have a by-the-numbers plot, typical performances, and a been-there-done-that tone, then what's the point of making a movie? When making a movie it should be at least twenty five percent different then what audiences have seen or else they're paying to see the same mediocrity over and over again.Overall, ""Grown Ups"" could possibly win the award for the most cliché Hollywood film of the century, although, surprisingly, that's sort of a complement. Grown Ups knows its formulaic and very dry, but they just want to give the audience a fun outing, which they do, but then what's the point? This is the type of film you watch on a rainy Saturday night with nothing possibly better to do or no other film you want on Redbox is available, yet this one is. This movie can have its moments and is not entirely bad, but it's just so formulaic and ""been- there-done-that"" that it's not even funny.

Sandler's movies always had a soft spot, but it's going too far now. Perhaps it's because he's getting old?

My advice is don't bother and watch something like the Hangover or American Pie. The movie is littered with lame gags that nowadays are not funny simply because you expect them.

103,robinski34,Groan Ups,7,31 August 2013,"Every bone in my body wanted to hate Grown Ups. Surely this would be another brain-dead Adam Sandler spliff, his partner in crime Senor Schneider's presence like a red rag to a bull, and yes GU is often crass and tasteless, smeared with great dirty stains of crude and puerile humour, but there is something else going on here. There is a resonance in the central theme of lost childhood and the simplicity of bygone days that speaks to our need for friendship and simple pleasures, and that enables me to forgive a lot of this film's lazy failings. For me there was one reluctant laugh for every two inward groans, and shakes of the head were often followed by a nod of recognition and possibly even a smile. There are some moments of effective slapstick and as we know from his better moments Sandler is capable of being likable. His posse of Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Schneider have an easy camaraderie that is watchable, and their significant others Salma Hayek, Maria Bello, Maya Rudolph and Joyce Van Patten provide effective foils for all the nonsense. Ultimately there is a sound message at the heart of Grown Ups and this is what redeems it. Infantile, misogynist, heart-warming fun for all the family.",Grown Ups
104,feyipuk,"Feel good, family fun",7,26 July 2014,"I can't say I'm a fan of Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Rob Schneider, Chris Rock and most of all David Spade, on there own. There is something about putting all their characters together that (sort of) works. Yes, they're playing the same characters that they always play. Yes, many of the jokes are physical/slapstick in nature. And, yes, you know that know matter how bad things get, it'll work out in the end. Yet, here that's actually a good thing, as they try to come to terms with how their lives have changed since school, and growing up. For example, Adam Sandler is a ""nice guy"", who feels his life has got away from reality, which is ironic, given his life is as a Hollywood agent. The way he acts, you do wonder how he got to be so successful at his job or how the story will affect future work. What makes the difference are the women in their lives. Maya Rudolph, Maria Bello and Salma Hayek play the preoccupied wives well. They have their lives more together than their partners, yet there's the sense that as a result they miss out on having the fun and sharing in the guys lives. The guys aren't trying to overcome some evil adversary with their humour, but trying to reignite the sparks in their relationships.",Grown Ups
105,nlytnd_1,The worst movie I've ever watched... no exaggeration!!!,1,10 December 2010,"Just for the record I like stupid comedies (among many other comedy type movies) and so do the other 2 people I watched this with and we all thought it was horrible! The only thing comedic about this movie is how bad it was/is. Every joke failed miserably... even if a joke or funny scene had potential it was presented in such a way that made it really not funny. The director used a comedic style that's intended for the audience to laugh with the characters rather than at them. It's a very difficult style to pull off, especially when it's used for 95% of a movie. In Grandmas Boy (which I really liked) they used this style (laughing with) for the scenes with J.P. and some other scenes as well and it worked. In order for that style to work the characters have to really be believable and even then the stars have to align.This movie was written and acted so bad that the style made it worse than it would have been otherwise. My friends and I all thought the same thing in reference to Selma Heyak, ""has she always been this bad of an actress."" Apparently yes, I guess her hotness covered it up all these years. Anything with Selma Heyak will be anti-chub from now on... I can't believe I was duped into not recognizing it before. Some type of badge should be given out if you made it through this movie without walking out or shutting it off. A badge of patience, withstanding torture, or a badge for stubbornness perhaps? I can't take all the credit, my friends and I helped pull each other through the ordeal.This is unarguably the worst high budget movie ever made.

106,montera_iulian,Maybe the screenwriter should grow up?,5,10 July 2010,"What would you expect from a comedy that has at least 3 of the best comedians today? Something awesome I assume. The result? Nothing like that. My review for this is kind of short since I don't have a lot of things to point out.The story is about 5 guys who remain in touch for like more than 40 years and decide to spend an entire weekend together in memory of their old childhood and their late coach. Now besides the fact that the movie is built around their memories from their childhood the movie also captures the conflict between the 2 generations in terms of childhood entertainment. This plot could really have a lot of funny moments but the script pretty much lacks of funny moments. Too many clichés, too many washed-up jokes and even at times a lot of overreacting. Adam Sandler, Chris Rock or Kevin James did great as far as acting but the problem was the script. It was so boring, predictable and few good jokes that in the second part of the movie I was bored but continued to watch it hoping that something could turn good. But it was the same. Salma Hayek was gorgeous for her age and I kept myself asking one question: why does she not appear in any movies lately? The execution was the same as the other Dennis Dugan movies, You Don't Mess with the Zohan or I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry. The soundtrack did not help the movie either just because it was so dull. I don't know what to actually say about this because I had such high expectations that I end up being so disappointed. Still this movie looks good for some hot afternoon you would wanna waste. There's nothing wrong with the cast since the chemistry is so good between all of them but the main problem is the story which is just... boring and not funny. I laughed like 3 times in the movie... If I recommend it? ... As an Adam Sandler fan, like I am, I would just because it's not that bad but as a whole movie... you could easily skip it.",Grown Ups
107,Legendary_Badass,Friends don't let friends see Grown Ups,2,25 June 2010,"Lenny (Adam Sandler) is the self-proclaimed most powerful agent in Hollywood. He's married to fashion designer Roxanne (Salma Hayek) and has three children with little grasp on reality. Lenny feels that much of his success is owed to the lessons provided to him during youth basketball by ""Coach Buzzer"". On hearing news of his beloved coach's death, Lenny wrangles up the family and heads to the funeral where he is reintroduced to the old starting lineup, Kurt (Chirs Rock), Rob (Rob Schneider), Marcus (David Spade), and Eric (Kevin James). After the funeral, Lenny makes arrangement for their families to spend the Fourth of July weekend at the nearby lake, providing them with a chance to catch-up and expose their kids to the elements.This may be a bold assumption, but with so many Saturday Night Live alums appearing above the title, I do believe Grown Ups is intended as a comedy and therein lies the trouble: Grown Ups is not funny. It might be gross, lowbrow, and nonsensical, but it isn't funny. Movie humor requires that the comedians not snicker at the jokes of their pals as if to cue audience laughter. It also helps to not affix one attribute to each comedian and ride it for the remainder of the film. Does Kevin James look heavy enough to be a running fat joke to you? Would Rob Schneider's affection for older women split your sides? As lame as these efforts are, none of them compete with that which Chris Rock is given. The movie is exactly clear, but it seems that he enjoys cooking. For some that makes him into a subtextual homosexual stereotype one moment, and a suspicious cheating black husband type the next. Regardless your interpretation of the coding, his vast spans of time without significant contribution to ""the story"" raises eyebrows. Celebrities hanging out doesn't have to make for a bad movie. The original Ocean's Eleven was a Rat Pack collaboration and Steven Soderbergh's 2001 remake rifled through George Clooney's curriculum vitae for supporting players. Both these films concerned a plot that was worthwhile, a casino heist. Friends get together to perform a task with a clear goal in mind— a tried and true formula. That's not good enough for industry trailblazers Adam Sandler and Fred Wolf, who pen a groundbreaking script for Grown Ups in which characters appear for the sake of luck, have one train of thought, have friends who despise them, have one defining characteristic that they retain from youth, and to top it off they have nothing of importance to accomplish. I could spend time on the levels of non-acting found in the child actors of Grown Ups, but the likely culprit for their performances is the unholy alliance between the writing and director Dennis Dugan's orchestration.There is something for the characters to accomplish, and it's the clichéd since the early '80s sporting event rematch. Even the worse of these movies does an effective job in setting up the big game that is until Grown Ups came along. Here, Lenny and friends didn't even know they were going to be playing basketball, but somehow the wives found the time to sew uniforms for both the boys and cheerleading attire for themselves.It's not enough to force characters into mingling when they are supposedly out of contact for years yet never miss a step. They don't argue with each other, and they don't discover a pirate treasure that will save their neighborhood. They have no drama. Since there is no friction or comedy, I see nothing that screams for Grown Ups to be approved, filmed, and theatrically released nationwide. The title is what children call adults and if it's part of your vernacular, you just might be in the target demographic.",Grown Ups

And I do agree with that, I do agree that life is more fun in the nature and surrounded by good old friends. Character analysis: We don't know enough about characters to like them or get a sense of the reasons why they do things. We don't know them in a deep level, we only know them superficially. Towards the end the movie intents to become emotional but it only becomes cringy.

David Spade gives me the absolute creeps - the only time I found him watchable was in Joe Dirt. Rob Schneider has done some passable comedy, apparently...I don't think there was any purpose to this film other than getting together a bunch of well known/semi-well known comedians and have them bounce dialogue off each other. It just doesn't work though, in fact it's painfully unfunny. After about the first 20 minutes you realise 'this is it'...How (the declining) Sandler and Rock thought this was a good move (or even a releasable movie) is beyond me.You can expect: Utterly unrealistic characters (and not in a funny way).

Rock - just, why?? Fat bloke - I don't know who you are but you being fat seems to amuse Americans. Rob Schneider - you have done some comedy that other people like. David Spade - you are as creepy as ever and bizarrely supposed to be attractive to women in the film?Do yourself a favour and watch Waterboy, Anger Management, Happy Madison or a Chris Rock stand up show for laughs.

I am a fan of Spade, James, Sandler, and Rock and I find them funny in movies of their own. This movie is not funny and one word comes to mind. Pretentious. This movie just assumes that because it has all these funny comedians in it that it will be funny by default. Its boring. It reminds me of a 1980's Dan Akroyd and John Candy movie called ""The Great Outdoors"". That movie also tried way too hard to be funny. It too was Pretentious.Grown ups would have been a lot funnier if it did not have children in it. I understand they are supposed to be ""grown up"" with their kids, but these comedians, minus Kevin James are usually in pretty vulgar movies and having kids part of this movie limits their comedic talent.Do yourself a favour and avoid this pretentious movie.

To be sure, he's put out some clunkers, but I always thought the criticism was a bit ridiculous.Anyone who was introduced to Sandler (and Rock, Spade, Schneider) via SNL knows what a comedy juggernaut this guy represented. And just like with Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Jim Carrey or Will Ferrell, there is always a backlash, fairly or unfairly.I have come to really enjoy this movie. It's one of those rewatchable flicks. The kind where if you happen to come across it flipping channels, you always watch it until the end. It isn't my favourite Sandler movie, nor is it even my favourite comedy.But it's a movie where every time I watch it, I appreciate the little inside joke moments. I know a few people who have worked on a Sandler movie-set, and they all speak very highly of him, and the atmosphere, on set.I love that Sandler has created his own cinematic universe, where he makes movies that involve his friends and family. I love that he taps into the SNL pool of talent, time and time again.And in an era of comic-book & fantasy blockbusters, he's still making 90-120 minute comedies.

To put it simply, we laughed our asses off. Kevin, Adam, Rob, Chris and David are at the top of their game and Grown Ups is a riot. An added bonus is Steve Bucemi's appearance in the second half. He hasn't been this funny since The Big Lebowski. Slapstick humor, dumb one-liners and groaners, a lot of old age gags, a few fart jokes and even a couple of sweet moments made this film worth our time. The supporting cast includes Salma Hayek, Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph. Even the indie crowd likes a good kick to the groin now and then.Director Dennis Dugan paces this comedy well and manages to keep any one of his comedy stars from stealing the show. Look for his cameo during the flashback scenes of the kids' basketball game.Sometimes we want art and sometimes we really need to enjoy ourselves.

I found myself just kicking back, laughing, and forgetting about everything else that was going on in my day.I am sure that the creators of this film thought the exact same thing!

123,RNHunter,Good but no better,5,13 July 2010,"Well first of all, to be fair, one can do worse than an Adam Sandler Happy Madison picture. It will of course be at least light entertainment and a good means for some at least minor enjoyment for a few hours. So let me be clear that I am not suggesting you take a pass on this movie. Maybe light entertainment is what you want.But Gone with the Wind it is not. While watching this movie I kept feeling that Adam Sandler must find his jokes far funnier than I did. I had to ask myself why, and I think Sandler, who is talented, is trying to do so much that he is over his head. Clearly with this being a Happy Madison picture, Sandler had a lot to do with the movie control as well. Well, the problem was that he was also too much the actor center of attention in the movie. He had some good cast with him, like Chris Rock, David Spade and others that can be quite funny. But I got the feeling that Sandler held them back, and they mostly stood around watching all the lead lines going to Adam Sandler and far too much of the action. One also suspects who did the script, since jokes could have been funnier - and yeah, guess, Sandler did much of that as well. So the issue is while he is talented, he struggles trying to produce, star, monopolize most of the most action and also write a funny movie. A smart person knows when to stop and when to turn loose your cast - Chris Rock, David Spade and others and let them be their funny selves.Alfred Hitchcock was often in his own movies, but often you could not even find him, and his movies were great. He knew where to limit. Clint Eastwood made the transition from actor to director and then sometimes both director and actor - but he does it. Eastwood makes it work. In an Eastwood movie, Eastwood is already an important character, but I never get the feeling that he is hogging the spotlight. So Eastwood films even with him doing multiple jobs stays real. Something Sandler should think about - be real to how much you can do.",Grown Ups

125,MikeK1987,"Poorly written dialog, Mediocre forced jokes, Sandler needs to stop making movies!!!!!",1,20 January 2011,"I grew up on Adam Sandler. SNL reruns on Comedy Central, ""Billy Madison"", ""Happy Gilmore"", ""The Waterboy"", & ""Little Nicky"". All movies that made me laugh when I was younger, and every once in a while, if I happen to catch one of them on cable, gets a bit of a chuckle out of me here and there. But with films like ""Big Daddy"", ""Mr. Deeds"", ""Click"" and ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"", Sandler got too serious (not counting his actual serious roles; ""Punch Drunk Love"", ""Reign Over Me"", and about 2/3 of ""Funny People"" were great, I f--king hated ""Spanglish""!). Sandler's biggest downfall was trying to make his films clean, I'm guessing so his kids could watch his movies. What made those 4 early movies so funny to me was that they weren't quite based in reality and featured a good amount of inebriation, not quite glorifying or bashing drug and alcohol use, but really just being silly about it.""Grown Ups"" is simply the latest of Sandler's ""serious clean comedies"". And while it's nowhere near the worst film ever made, I would sooner watch ""Battlefield Earth"" or ""The Room"" before I watch this piece of s--t again!I really expected more from the 5 lead actors. Adam Sandler and David Spade almost get in some good lines, but they're few and far between. Kevin James and Rob Schneider characters are nothing more than punching bags for jokes. Their characters are quite simply a fat guy, and a hippie vegan with a wife that's twice his age, and that's all that their characters are. I usually hate cardboard cutouts, but then again those 2 guys deserve it, since their acting repertoire includes such gems as ""The Hot Chick"" and ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"". The only credible one out of the lot is Chris Rock, who, while I'm not typically a fan of his acting roles, I throughly enjoy his stand-up. And the actors who have portrayed so much better roles in much better films like Salma Hayek, Steve Buscemi, and Maya Rudolph, only makes this film that much more painful to watch! I really hope that deep down all of the credible actors in this film do regret working on this film.The jokes are forced, if non-existent. The various subplots of the snobbish spoiled rotten kids, the sex-starved married couples, the frequent lying and unfounded suspicions, the stupid childhood rivalries, the Asian nanny foreign exchange student. And I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what other unfinished subplots this film entails. Come to think of this, there's barely even a central plot to being with! This film is nothing more than Adam Sandler wanting to go on vacation with his buddies and get paid for it, which would explain so much if it turned out to be true!Another thing that bugs me about later Sandler films, including this one, is that they are always crammed full of your typical Classic Rock station playlist, but don't get me wrong, I actually like most of the bands that were featured in this soundtrack (ex. Bad Company, Jefferson Starship, Joe Walsh). But that kind of soundtrack worked for ""Joe Dirt"", because that movie was actually about the music. In ""Grown Ups"", it's just shading a false sense of nostalgia that's never even been established. The worst of that is the repeat usage of Joe Walsh's ""A Life of Illusion"", which was used to much greater effect in the beginning of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"".I've really had enough of these stupid Sandler films. You would think that after being involved in making such great films like ""Punch Drunk Love"" or ""Funny People"", that he would've hopefully gotten his priorities straight and tried to make a decent comedy with some substance and good writing and good directing and so on, but it's still so clear to me that Adam Sandler cares nothing more than to get the easy paycheck about 90% of the time, and only very occasionally will take a risk on a not-so-easily bankable movie. Yeah, you'd think after being fresh from working with Judd Apatow, that Sandler would've learned something by now about making a great movie. But no. That's not happening when you can command such a high salary for this s--t!",Grown Ups

This is also the premise of his new film. This film, was no doubt a situation where I'm sure these friends had more fun shooting it than what we get in return. An absolute abysmal film and largely a comedy that perhaps 15 years ago might have had some better Sandler moments. Here, these guys look tired and old and are not honing their comedic craft. Compare this comedy to the newest ones we have been given in the last several years. 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall to name a few. Sandler's crew do nothing to accommodate where we are going in terms of humor, nor where we have been.

Out comes a sporadically - at times hysterically - funny comedy, more episodic than coherent, with bouts of the trademark Sandler-Dugan sentimentality. These guys do know each other for decades, and the natural ease that accompanies their actions is the major asset of this film. On the distaff side, Maria Bello is memorable for all the wrong reasons, and it would be interesting to know how the executives at Sony got Salma Hayek and Joyce Van Patten committed to the project.

Unfortunately, most of the jokes were cringe-worthy. I've liked Sandler in past films, and he has some good lines here as well....which is the problem. Y'see, Sandler co-wrote the script with another fella, which leads me to believe Sandler wrote all the good lines for himself, along with giving himself a beautiful wife. This is all my theory, but it's strange how he (out of all 5 leads) didn't have many problems with his personal life.Nevertheless, the interaction between them is solid at times, awkward at others. I actually liked Spade the most since it felt like he wasn't delivering his lines like a robot. Another issue was when all 5 were together, it felt more like they were doing standup for a large crowd instead of playing off each other naturally and doing some, I dunno, ACTING.

135,bradencn,Adam Sandler and Crew Having Fun at Our Expense,3,20 November 2014,"Adam Sandler has done a lot of wonderful things, don't get me wrong, but this film is not one of them. It was extremely frustrating to watch. In short, it seemed like Adam Sandler and his group of goonies thought up all of the fun stuff they would like to do in a movie and just did it. Sure there were a few good one-liners, but about 15 minutes into the movie, it was pretty obvious not only how it was going to end, but that it would be a pretty bland comedy throughout. Unfortunately, I watched this film just after watching 21 Jump Street for the first time. Adam Sandler having such a successful comical career, my expectations were pretty high for this film. However, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, who are not as famous as Adam Sandler, completely owned him as far as humor goes in this film.I will not compare the two films beyond that but let me share the ""blandness"" of this film:5 childhood friends now grown ups are these immature men with families of their own...3 of them with hot wives of their own, 1 the typical single guy (David Spade...is he EVER not single??), and 1 getting it on with an old chick and randomly has two extremely hot daughters. Of course all of the other men drool over these daughters (not surprisingly), but what makes it not funny is that you knew that it was going to happen. I mean, come on. Everybody in this film: Adam Sandler, David Spade, Kevin James, Kris Rock, Rob Schneider...their actions and comedy were SO PREDICTABLE! David Spade was still the single horny guy, Kevin James was still the fat loser that was always loved but made fun of, Adam Sandler was still the somewhat intelligent but nonchalant father that liked to crack his typical corny jokes. Kris Rock was perhaps the only unique character in this whole film. Honestly, his role was pretty funny, as was Maya Rudolph's (who played his wife).It seemed like Adam Sandler, when writing the film, said, ""Hey guys, wouldn't it be fun to go to a water park in a film? You wanna go?"" And then David Spade said, ""Yea, that would be cool. I'm down to have at least one scene where I get drunk again and forget to put on my pants."" And then Kevin James said, ""Haha that WOULD be funny. I would love a scene where I can eat chicken wings and dance around with the KFC bucket on my head, just because, like, who does that?!"" And then Adam Sandler comes back in and says, ""Sure! That all sounds funny! Wouldn't it also be funny if we played the game where we shot an arrow in the air and ran from it, but it actually came down and struck someone in the foot? That would be great!"" And then Rob Schneider says, ""HAHA! I'll take the hit! And then I'll have my funny older wife fix it for me while I try to act like I am in so much pain!""Come on, seriously? It was just dumb humor. People may think that I'm too hard to please when it comes to this film, but, quite honestly, please, if you are going to write a comedy, think it through. I don't want to watch a film that feels like everyone in it just want to have some fun and trust that the world would love watch them being goofy at a water park or in a nice vacation home. I want the film to be written for ME (yes, I'm selfish...write to ME, your AUDIENCE). I don't want to feel like you wrote this just for yourselves because you knew you would make a profit anyway.There was no depth to this film, no sinking lesson learned (sure, it had a theme of appreciating the simple things in life, but it didn't sink home like a movie like ""The Intouchables"" would), and it only proved successful because of the ""all-star"" cast that seems to be stuck doing the same things over and over again.

136,riva-910-797068,Disappointing,3,29 November 2010,"For a movie to be called grownups adolescent jokes abound in this movie. From the guys playing ""the dozens"" with each other to peeing in a public pool it was like watching overgrown teenage boys.The movie centers on a group of childhood friends that come together due to the death of their middle school basketball coach. The friends with their wives and children spend the weekend together to scatter the coach's ashes and get reacquainted. While there they refocus on what is really important in life; friends and family.The plot was uninspired. Middle aged men looking at their lives and realizing how off the mark they are. The story was just an excuse to get all these really funny guys together. Too bad their talents were wasted on potty humor and sex (or rather the lack thereof that they complain about). There were stereotypical characters like the rich guy with spoiled kids or the hen pecked husband. These characters gave way to the regular repertoire of momma jokes or fat jokes.I sat in the theater thinking I wish I had a remote to fast forward. I was uninterested in the story and the characters. I was under no illusion that this would not be a thought provoking drama but I was expecting lots of laughs with this line up.

This, however, is a bunch of actors messing around amidst a very flimsy framing device.They play basketball, they go to a water park, they fall over (several times). And that's it. There aren't any jokes, there's no character development and there's certainly no plot twists.I'm baffled as to how Sandler wrote this back in the nineties and hasn't seen fit to work the script into something workable. Nope, I guess it was easier just to ring up his friends (the talentless Kevin James, Rob Schneider and David Spade, the mediocre Chris Rock, the hopelessly loyal Steve Buscemi) and suggest that they all spend a studio's budget on having some laughs.

138,lucius_420,"Don't Watch It,, see the trailer and then Just Say No to Garbage!",1,1 July 2010,"If you have any real sense of humor at all, then you should agree with me that Adam Sandler has not been in a funny movie since Little Nicky. Obviously him and Dave and Rob and Chris really show their true lack of any comedic talent at all and how the only reason they were ever truly funny at all was because there were a lot of extremely-high-on-drugs writers during their good old days at Saturday Night Live back when Chris Farley (R.I.P.) was alive who sadly ended up overdosing on drugs just as John Belushi (R.I.P.) did before him while working at the same show. I read that John Belushi was supposed to be hanging out with Robbin Williams the night he overdosed and died and that is the reason why Robin Williams stopped doing drugs. I always wondered why he stopped being funny. You should check out his old stand-up comedy act when he is super high on drugs, it is phenomenal and the reason most people still think he can be funny. These scumbags that can't act or tell a single funny original joke are doing a disservice to the comedic profession by agreeing to take a paycheck from this retarded script together just so they can take millions of dollars out of the pockets of the millions of brainwashed adult human slaves that don't have a taste for any kind of movie that isn't a totally unintelligent ""romantic comedy"" and are the reason for the worse and worse mediocrity we are faced with daily from Hollywood products. They're not romantic at all and they're not comedic at all so stop making these horrible films you curs!!! Lowly dogs! I watched the trailer and I knew instantly that this film was a steaming pile of donkey turds. The script writers of Hollywood obviously think that the same five slapstick gags will work a million times over in every single ""comedy"" movie they put out again and again and again. Actually, they're drama/comedies now because all subliminal messages are designed to force you to accept enslavement by your connection to the society you live in. They want you to think that you have to spend your life being subservient to some cruel heartless frigid female. They want to dumb down your idea of humor so that you will accept more and more boring movies as actual comedy. Here's where I come in with one of my favorite lines from the John Waters movie 'Cecil B. Demented': ""Power to the people who punish bad cinema!"" Don't let yourself settle for mediocrity, go back to your VHS collection and watch 'Three Amigos' which is several million times funnier that this movie and always will be no matter how stoned I am. The real shame for me is that this is the second (or third?) time that they have gathered the old SNL gang together without Chris Farley and they have instead inserted the fat completely untalented unoriginal horrible ""actor"" named Kevin James as a substitute for the ""fat-guy-falling-down-and-rolling-around-slapstick"" that is totally a rip-off of Chris Farley's brand of comedy and a cheap pale imitation of his shadow as though that wouldn't produce insult to injury. I consider it to be a seriously grave insult to the memory of Chris Farley, a man whose slapstick was actually hilarious because he worked really hard to make it look like he didn't plan it, as though it wasn't staged. I loved Chris Farley's comedy. He was freaking brilliant. This Farley wannabe thing really needs to be shot and killed more than once. Boycott this movie and all Sandler/Spade/Rock/Scnheider productions that feature Kevin James as a Chris Farley substitute or you are a traitor to comedy! Seriously, they've got enough millions already, they could have spent their own money for once actually writing a script and making an actual funny movie! It is entirely obvious to me now that they aren't trying to make funny movies. The Hollywood overlords have decided this is the big romantic comedy you're getting this summer with the most droll script imaginable. The child worship syndrome has really got to stop. Fundamentalist Christians who censor true art that might make you realize how supporting this ""Adam Sandler movie"" with your money is making you more stupid and making the quality of future films even worse. IF you actually go see this in the theater then when they get the check for millions the idiot script producers think, ""Oh, they paid me 300 million big ones for that steaming pile of dog turds, so they must like dog turds and so I'll make a whole bunch more dog turd films because that is what everyone is paying to see. None of the producers there have true vision. Every movie they make is intended to make adults act more like children. The freaking title to this one itself gives the dang game away even. Like that other review I saw (which was brilliant, by the way) said, ""Friends don't let friends see Grown-Ups"". Seriously people, you need to pay attention here. Hollywood is forming peoples world view and is the main reason that the world has gone to hell because it is why so many adults act like children. As Bill Hicks put it, we have an 8th grade emotional level as a country. Going to kill a lot of other people in Afghanistan and Iraq based on hearsay evidence is something only a child would do.

To me it just wasn't that funny and the movie only focuses on the fact that these are a bunch of old dudes not in their prime anymore. Sandler always gets the most beautiful women in his movies so of course he went with Selma Hayek and Maria Bello. They are still very talented actresses but all they could do is work with the roles that were handed to them. Steve Buscemi was the best part of this movie but you can put him in pretty much anything and hes hilarious. He is also the only actor out of the other guys that is still doing well (Boardwalk Empire). I think maybe it is time for Adam to throw in the towel or start aiming for more serious roles since he can't be the funny guy that we all knew and loved 12 years ago. I hope he takes a good look at himself and realizes he can't do these kind of movies anymore and sell it as a comedy. This felt like a drama and im not impressed at all.",Grown Ups
141,ikari1,"Great comedy, definitely underrated",10,9 October 2011,"This is one of those movies about catching up with old friends, and watching the effects all these pasted and some time wasted years had on each other. The laughs are plenty, the acting is perfect for a comedy, the women look hot (really hot), and the men vulnerable and true. The script is just right and the gags have not gone overboard. With the exception of sandler and hayek, every other snl star on this movie has been filming comedy flops for a long time, so when i decided to see the movie was only because i wanted to watch a feel good comedy, and my expectations were not that high. What can I say? I was pleasantly surprised, this movie delivers, it is a sweet little comedy, that you can watch with your other half.",Grown Ups
142,cesarbau,"Sometimes funny, but mostly we are not amused",4,28 October 2010,"For some of us watching ""Grown Ups"", a buzzer at the end of the first half would have been a welcome relief. At that point, Roxanne Chase-Feder (Selma Hayek- Pinault, please note), the wife of ex-school basketball star Lenny Feder (Adam Sandler), prepares to storm out of the lakeside lodge and fly back to Milan, where she is a fashion maven.By then, we have been subjected to the images of a dead man's ashes blown over a bucket of fried chicken; a ""48-month-old"" boy being breast-fed; a grandmother's bunion and swollen toe; a middle-aged fat man urinating while in the middle of a New England lake in full view of young ladies; and bacon sizzling on a bug zapper. Those gags are meant to make our day, but despite the occasional wit, restrained flatulence jokes, and chuckle- baiting punch lines, they leave us cheerless and wondering if we deserve better.No, we don't deserve better, because we stay glued to our seats, hungry for any entertainment. Roxanne stays for the flimsiest of reasons, and we get another dose of the same-oh same-oh, only a bit grosser, a tad zanier, and a little more hectic. Sometimes, in a flash of comedic brilliance or a cute, well-delivered joke, we laugh. Sometimes. Breast milk squirts across the screen. Dave Spade's bum makes a cinematic debut (""That's an ass?"" – the movie's best line). And some pratfalls happen, but we're still not amused.Just before the end, we are treated to what could be the most excruciating scene from Hollywood in recent years, when out of the blue, the three married couples in the story do the I-have-something-to-confess routine, pouring out their hurts and pain not even hinted at earlier. Television does this sort of thing much better and ""Grown Ups"" shows how deeply television has subverted mainstream cinema, and us moviegoers as well. If the scene was meant to be a parody, then the script and direction could have used a lot of fine-tuning. Curiously, the careers of the main collaborators of this movie, director Dennis Dugan and co-screenwriter Sandler himself, got started in television. The sad thing is what they have here is a rich lode of possibilities, from the story concept to the able actors. A quintet of middle school basketball stars reunites after 30 years for the funeral of their coach, their mentor on life. This theme of buddies' reunion has produced two memorable films, ""The Secaucus Seven"" and ""The Big Chill"". Structuring a comedy or farce around it -- now that's a true challenge. Another angle barely explored here is the new generation gap: between the texting and the Web-social-networking kids of the Digital Noughties and the survivors of the Me Decade of the 70s, or the Revivalist 80s .Sandler succeeds in the box-office because he has made and still can make millions laugh. And to top it all, he's got one of the most likable faces in the business, totally affable and engaging in a reassuring sort of way. And don't forget his great comic timing, delivered with his trademark smile. But he may be depleting his bank of admirers. He and the other makers of ""Grown Ups"" were sitting on a gold mine of material and talent but they managed to deliver only fluff.",Grown Ups

144,airguitar57,Do you really need us for this,5,6 August 2010,"Since the advent of the internet, we have become inundated with film trailers. Like anything on the web, this causes criticism to flow like water. There are shouts of ""the trailer gives too much of the film away"", ""all the good jokes are in the trailer"", ""the trailer is extremely misleading"" as well as any number of ""first"" or homophobic remarks (isn't anonymity fun). Grown Ups is that increasingly rare case where the trailer pretty well defines the film. It isn't anything special and it sure isn't the funniest film of the year, but it's got Adam Sandler and all his friends so it can't be all bad.Back in 1978, five friends won the basketball championships. It was the best time of their lives and they were the best of friends. Thirty years later, these guys have grown apart and almost completely lost touch. After the death of their championship basketball coach, Coach ""Buzzer"" (Blake Clark), the five friends are reunited. To celebrate the life of their beloved coach, Lenny (Adam Sandler) rents their favorite childhood camp for the Fourth of July weekend. Over the weekend, the friends are forced to cope with the changes that have accompanied their long absence and rediscover the friendship they once shared.I am torn whether to be annoyed at Grown Ups or to just let it be. One thing is for sure, the film doesn't try to be anything special. That may be the root of my annoyance, the fact that the film doesn't try. A film with the amount of talent that Grown Ups carries, with the exception of poor old Rob Schneider, has the potential to be damn funny. Unfortunately, it seems like Schneider is trying the hardest out of the bunch and that doesn't work out well for anyone, just look at what happened with The Animal. There were moments in the film where I wondered if an audience was even necessary. Clearly, each and every person involved in the film is enjoying himself. I can only imagine how good a time it was to make this film. These guys are being paid to hang out with some of their best friends and goof around. That sounds awesome. The problem seems to be that there was no one there to remind them that a film was actually being made. Filming the events that take place seems like an afterthought. I'm glad these guys were able to enjoy themselves, but the audience isn't benefiting from their jubilation.The story is weak. Sure, people reunite but let's be honest, it is rarely smooth. If you haven't seen an old friend for years, are you going to dive right back into the good old joking times? I think not. I don't doubt that eventually everything would be back to the way it used to be, but it's going to take longer than 2 minutes. Hell, even that first time you see your friends after going to college is awkward, and we're only talking about months at that point. All I ask is that a film offers me a bit of believability and Grown Ups seems almost shocked that a viewer would ask for such a thing.If you were to stop reading at this point, it would seem like I despised this film, but I didn't. There are plenty of laughs in the film, and even more if you have no problem surrendering your intellect for 102 minutes. Most of the children in the film are as annoying as the day is long, but there is one bright spot in Becky Feder (Alexys Nycole Sanchez) the youngest daughter of Sandler's character. The girl oozes cute and is the sweetest character in the whole film. She is so sweet that it verges on making your teeth hurt and you will have to fight a strong urge to say ""awww"" anytime she's on screen. Some jokes outstay their welcome (I'm looking at you, joke about the pool water changing color, you weren't funny the first time) but there are enough jokes that land to make the film watchable.I will admit to being bias to pretty much anything Adam Sandler does. My love of Sandler can be traced back to a place of deep immaturity and my discovery of Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. I've grown up with the films of Adam Sandler, Big Daddy remaining one of my favorites to this day, and to dislike one of his films almost feels sacrilegious (I like to pretend that Little Nicky never happened). If this wasn't a Happy Madison production the film's grade would probably be a letter lower, but the middle-schooler in me just couldn't do it. If you choose to cry foul, that is just fine, it's a generational thing.Grown Ups is a film that seems perfectly happy just being itself. The entire film seems cobbled together just so a bunch of friends can get a chance to hang out. My best guess is that the atmosphere of the entire production was extremely fun and filled with quite a bit of hilarity. The problem is that only a little bit of that hilarity found its way on screen. Despite all of the faults, it isn't a total waste of time. It's hard to keep from at least chuckling throughout the film, but that's just a compliment to the comedians. The film also proves that Colin Quinn is actually still alive, which is a nice little surprise. There is no reason to rush to the theaters to see Grown Ups but whenever you get around to it, I'm sure you'll walk away smiling.",Grown Ups
145,batudingin,They could do much worse,7,13 July 2010,"Some are not happy with the movie. And that is OK since this movie never aims for an Oscar. But come on give it a break. Adam is clearly trying to make something to do anyway. And they seem to have a good time making it and it shows. The alumni of Saturday night? Minus Chris Farley that is, challenged by the work horse king of queens. Allow me to make a point. How many other movies that needs an out of the world story? Sandler clearly has done enough remakes, click, Mr deeds, and other stories that is not even that funny to begin with. Chris rock? are you kidding me? He is on a downward spiral thanks to copying french and foreign movies and making it Brooklyn wise. The short guys? Spade and Mr Gigolo? Whatever they have been doing has the critics confuse their work for hecklers.All I am saying is they could have done worse. Much worse than this. But this one has got some point, especially at the end, the thing Sandler said about winning and losing clearly shows that he still holds his grounds well by being who he is despite the mega budget outlay of the motion picture. The laugh per minute is well, not bad. If you cannot Laugh, then smile. If you cannot smile, then smurf. This movie is to bad to be frown all about. Let's have fun and make friendship worthwhile with the people you care about the most.Me and my friends seldom does the same thing. Like what some of them do in the movie.

The reason it's so bad is that it's simply missing the whole point of it -having a family vacation with lots of trouble showing the generation gap between the parents and their children. The whole story gets too messy when the story and its scenes are focused on irrelevant details and characters (like those guys from the basketball game...) instead of the already known variety of characters. And besides ,most of the cast was pretty bad (especielly like Adam Sandler which was smug ,Salma Hayek was unconvincing ,Maya Rudolph unreliable ,Rob Schneider was simply ridiculous ,and David Spade as his usual flat meaningless characters.....) not mentioning it wasn't funny most of the time (there were a few funny jokes but that's it) -and it was sometimes very vulgar and sexist.

150,jjf662001,5 friends reunited for a funeral for their old basketball coach.,7,1 January 2011,"DVD ALERT. Grown up'sI was at friend's house over the thanks giving day holiday weekend helping with his holiday decorations outside. We got into a conversation about movies my favorite topic. He said he had a copy of grownups staring Adam Sandler. I said definitely, how you could go wrong with an Adam Sandler movie.I know there are people saying Adam Sandler is too childish for me. What can you say about Adam Sandler he has made some memorable movie characters? He didn't disappoint with his latest Happy Madison project. He brought together a group of some today's funniest comedians including Chris rock, Kevin James, David spade, and Rob Schneider. It also includes the beautiful Salma Hayek, Maria Bello and Maya Rudolph. I thought it was a good script about a bunch of old friends brought together years later by the death of their old basketball coach. They reunite after 30 years in a small New England town to pay respect to their fallen coach. When they first meet they give each other razzing about how much they have changed weigh gain, Chris rocks house husband life, Kevin James wife breast feeding his 4 yr old (very funny scenes) rob Schneider very older wife and beautiful daughters and the guys trying to figure out how they came out of him. The location of the movie in New England was a great choice; the cabin they stayed in the local town had a family friendly feeling to it. Some of the memorable scenes were they were eating after the funeral and Mari Bello started breasts feeding their son.She called him over to where she was sitting pulled out her breast. The group asked how old their son is she said 4 yrs old. Chris rock face had this look of horror and slide down the bench...lol. The comedy in this movie is definitely Adam Sandler material. The scene at the pool in the water park defiantly fit that bill. Kevin James daughter asked while in the pool are peeing in the pool he said no honey; she says they put a blue liquid in there to see pee. He said it's just a myth sweetheart. The pan back the camera and all off his buddies are peeing, the whole pool of people scatters. I enjoyed this movie because it had a buddy theme to it, old friends get together reminisce about the old days, talk about what there up too. There is a lot of joking around between them and their families. Throughout the movie Adam and the guys realize its has become very hard to raise there kids they way they have been raised when they were kids. Adam Sandler realizes his kids have become very spoiled brats ex: they got insulted when the nanny brought then hot chocolate that wasn't Godiva flavored. He try to get them to realize there other things to enjoy then video games 24 7, playing outdoors getting fresh air skipping rocks on the lake where their cabin is. His other movies were mostly geared towards guys and his sense of humor. This has a family sense to it.You get to know the guys families as the movie goes on, and it more than a regular Adam Sandler movie you're used to. It has a family atmosphere to it. This a movie everybody can enjoy. It was the type of movie where you can imagine you and your friends in the roles of Sandler and his buddies and their families. When you're done you will want to call your friends and say hey let's get tighter for a barbecue.I really enjoyed this movie and would definitely suggest buying or renting it.I give it 2 1/2 stars.my link is http://thehollywoodreview.blogspot.com/",Grown Ups

The rest of the film barely elicits a chuckle but it turns in to a family feel good film that doesn't make you want to run screaming for the exits. What seriously helps is the movie's babe watch factor believe it or not.

153,GodsPrototype,Final nail in the coffin...,1,19 December 2012,"This is a harsh review but exactly how I feel a few hours after watching it - unhappy and depressed! I looked at the front cover of the DVD in tesco, it looked fun, was £3 and promised lots with some of the best comedy actors in the business, I was excited to see it, I love Sandler, Buscemi, Rock, James and Schneider...then......Two hours later... I was wondering whether to hang myself or convince myself that times have changed and this is what comedy is now. This film is without a doubt one of the unfunniest funny films ever.There can be no real spoilers for there is no real plot - that's okay though, some films without plot are some of the best ever made - but this is just badly written and it's one of those films where every scene you're watching: you're thinking to yourself ""Well, my Nan could have made that scene funnier"" (by writing it, not starring in it!) I've turned away from Hollywood before and if this is the new future of comedy then count me and millions of others out.Is this the final nail in the coffin of the career of Adam Sandler? Maybe! But when 'Men in Black 3' is funnier than the latest Sandler film then you know that something has gone terribly wrong. This has actually been £3 wasted and I've never said that about a film before.If you want a film to make you go ""huh, that was kinda comical"" three or four times in a tedious two hour sitting then this is it, if you want to have a good laugh and feel good about yourself after - head off elsewhere!",Grown Ups

155,ajfdomingo,Familiar Lines,6,13 September 2010,"Grown Ups is one of those films that can be seen as either fun or repulsive. Adam Sandler's slapstick and often times, bawdy brand of humor tends to polarize viewers into opposing camps. One cannot help but think about Saturday Night Live, with the composition of the cast and the way the script is written. You can feel like you are watching a set of comedy skits stitched together. Having said that, Grown Ups, in my view generates enough laughs to be considered entertaining. The characters do go over the top with their physical routines and coarse jokes but that can also be what separates this film from other comedy flicks. Sandler risks making films that border on the absurd and that is what can turn away some people. There are times though that Sandler's daring can make it worth paying the admission price. Make it a matinée though.",Grown Ups
156,stitch-99,Just close your eyes and think of England.,1,8 December 2010,"I was coerced into seeing this film in theaters, which my entire party soon regretted. There is, quite simply, a shortage of hate-charged words to describe how I feel about this movie.Since it is supposed to be a comedy, I'll start off on that subject: almost all of the humour was insultingly stupid. Whenever the audience around me would laugh at something that almost literally physically pained me, I wanted to stand up and shout, ""DON'T ENCOURGE THIS!!!"" Quite frankly, it's a miracle I didn't. The few funny lines were surrounded by so much idiocy that I can barely remember any of them.Moving on, the plot line (or lack thereof) was absolute manure. Throughout the entire film, we simply throw five different families, each of which has enough going on to be a movie unto themselves, into the same location and watch what unfolds. No single subplot was given enough prominence to be considered the main conflict. Subplots would be resolved really early in the film, forcibly dragged back up, and quickly resolved a second time. Throughout the movie, there was a running gag about Kevin James' bad health, which one would think would turn into a major part of the story. Well, that just makes too much sense. Instead, Kevin James gives the revelation nearly at the end that he was recently fired and can't find a job, which wasn't foreshadowed at all. And, his poor health serves to just get him out of the way so that Adam Sandler can complete his subplot with his son. Most of the many subplots were resolved by a spontaneous scene in which everyone simply talks everything through, with no sense of conflict whatsoever. The antagonists of the movie, while the funniest parts, were hardly ever on screen, never developed, and their inclusion in the ""story"" made little sense.If my review spares one person from violating themselves with this abomination passing itself off as entertainment, my sacrifice will have been worth it.",Grown Ups

There is also hardly any plot, the acting is mediocre, as parents all the adults should lose their rights, half the people are just total A-holes in this 'peice of crap' movie.And yet, I never get tired of it. I have no idea why either. It's just an Adam Sandler feel-good movie, and I could easily treat this one like I do Funny people (Which is straight up HORRIBLE) or some older comedy that he's in, but I think the title 'Grown Ups' is actually very accurate for this one. Maybe it's cause I tried a different approach the first time I watched this movie and made myself look forward to it and feel right at home. Maybe I just like the simplicity of it. I think the main reason a lot of people don't like is the expectations they had. Again, it's understandable considering the cast, and the many missed opportunities for a good joke, but I still love it. To me, this is actually Grown Up and really down-to-earth and realistic: something that I could do in my lifetime.

They bring their own families to a ""lake house"" and soon find that the free-spirited goofiness of their childhood hasn't faded, even if they are supposed to set good examples for their kids.Filmed mostly on Boston's North Shore at Chebacco Lake in Essex MA (it was fun to see the basketball game at the end, which took place at a park quite familiar to me--home to a long running folk music festival). May-December romances and spoiled kids; ""fugly""-looking teammates who father gorgeous daughters (well, two out of three...); using a bug zapper to fry bacon, and daring stunts at a water park, this film is a goofy, enjoyable romp that shows some boys who become ""grown ups"" but don't forget their inner kid.",Grown Ups

The only movie I tolerated him in was ""50 First Dates,"" and that's only because my daughter was on a flight from Salt Lake to Anchorage in 2003 and was sitting behind some men who were talking about a movie they were working on called ""50 First Kisses"" (title later changed). I saw the movie (title later changed) so I could see some Alaskan scenery, only to find that the whole thing took place in Hawaii with just a tiny bit of Alaska at the end.Sandler plays a successful Hollywood agent with spoiled kids and a gorgeous wife who is a successful clothes designer. He reunites with his old boyhood basketball-playing friends (who won a championship in 1978) 30+ years later at their coach's funeral. Afterwards they and their families spend a few days together at the late coach's summer cabin on a lake (in Essex, Massachusetts--beautiful scenery!) and try to reconnect and relive their childhood years by acting like idiots, ignoring their wives and ogling young girls (daughters of the character played by Rob Schneider) and trying to introduce their children to the joys of a 1970s childhood (no video games, iPods, cellphones).Adam Sandler is talented but I'll stick with him in SNL, thank you very much. I challenge him to write/produce a movie that has some substance and actually encourages the audience to think--not making crude, stupid, comedies. He has the talent; he just doesn't do it.

Adam Sandler plays Lenny Feder, a successful Hollywood agent who has grown annoyed at his children being spoilt. The gang, now all married with children alike, with the exception of Spade's character Marcus, spend the Fourth July weekend in a lake house in New England catching up on their misspent youth. Cue lots of fun at the water park and plenty of old people gags.My verdict: The casting is great, you can see Sandler and his real life buddies are having a great time in this feel good movie. I loved Maria Bello in this, especially as I wasn't used to seeing her in such a comic role, so was a nice surprise. I have to say I don't think it's worth the cinema price as despite the cast it isn't side splitting funny but is consistent with the humour. The few belly laughs in the film come from Steve Buscemi who essentially saves the film for me. It gets a bit cheesy in places but luckily the jokes quickly nip that in the bud.It's not what you would call thought provoking and there's a lot of boyish humour there. That said it doesn't skimp on the comedy or the talent. It's sure to make for a great night in so I fully recommend the DVD when it comes out.",Grown Ups

This movie made me laugh out loud a couple times. It also reminded me of things I did as a kid as well. Not being ignorant to the type of movies A.S. makes I fully knew what to expect. I wasn't looking for Citizen Kane, Casa Blanca or Network but something light and funny and this movie fit that bill for me. Now next time I want to watch a movie that makes me feel angry, depressed or hateful I'll watch Schindler's List, Sophie's Choice or Taxi Driver.

Like one reviewer rightly said- u get to only giggle 2-3 times. its a pity movie goers cant sue directors and actors of a terrible movie. For that wil end this problem of citizens being deceived on a large scale. in fact its made me begin to dislike kevin james, chris rock, rob schneider, adam sandler, etc for even being in a movie like this and i hate sandler even more for writing this piece of garbage,UNLESS his intention was to lullaby kids to sleep, then i would say-its a classicthis movie is worth 0.1 stars",Grown Ups
170,Krusader_Donkey,"DHKR: Grown Ups- ""A Harmless Summer Bro-Film""",6,27 May 2015,"Grown Ups isn't good. It's actually quite awful in critical terms. It's only saving grace is it's cast of actors, but even their potential is squandered at Sandler's obviously juvenile sense of humor, which mostly relies on the whole ""Hey! Look at this, isn't it wacky and silly?"" notion. It's story is nonexistent, much like Seinfeld, only going through simple settings and ideas for a clunky-linked sequence.As you guessed, this is a Happy Maddison film, makers of a surprise hit (www.imdb.com/title/tt1114740/reviews-208) but mostly are infamous for their juvenile- humor movies that are meant only for the lowest common denominator. Don't ever expect anything from these guys, cause I'm aware of how little they care. They, in turn, should realize how little I care.If I'm able to tip my hat to the production company for anything, it would be that HMP knows who it's general audience is, and knows them in spades,which isn't particularly a bad thing. Before, I stated that Sandler's modern filmography, when under this production company's name, can be enjoyed as films you watch with friends over the summer. And Grown Ups, silly as it is, is exactly the definitive film for that description.Grown Ups has it's moments, but it's always pushed to the side so Kevin James can earn a ladder on a board game of Chutes and Ladders or if David Spade can take another groin-shot by Rob Schneider. It's dumb, it's full of plot holes and subplots that go nowhere, and it really is just an excuse for Sandler take a vacation at the Lake and still get him and his buddies paid. But, for all my griping, I feel a weird creeping nostalgia of my own summer vacations when watching this. I felt myself actually smile, laughing even. Take a moment to think about all the dumb things you did with your friends over that time. The time you first time you went on a massive water slide at a water park and went so fast that you almost broke a toe. The time you won 4 games of Scene-It in a row and your buddy threatened to punch you in the face if he found out you cheated. The time you first did something so profoundly stupid, resulting in any injury imaginable, but you just laughed and laughed because you were under some kind of influence. It's very cartoonish, sure, but don't you remember having any close calls like that?That's what makes Grown Ups work as a Summer Bro-Film. It makes tons of money from teenagers that laugh at Sandler's bag of tricks, but it also makes one connect to one's personal past from the summers you spent AS a teenager, acting like a bunch of jackasses after watching TV. It's still bad, as a film, but for those who can look pass that, I think you can enjoy it.3 and a half Stars- C-Ranking",Grown Ups

Grownups had too much juvenile ""put down"" humor. The buddies (the wives aren't given much to say or do) put down the kids, the adults, the mother-in-law, even the dog. Very lazy, shallow script that could have been a comedy classic. After 22 Sandler movies, I only rated 2 very good (50 First Dates with Drew Barrymore and Don't Mess with the Zohan). I hated Big Daddy because it taught kids it's OK to pee against the wall in the city. Grownups gives guys frequent leering of T&A. Yawn for us chicks, Adam Sandler has become like Burt Reynolds and his Smoky and the Bandit ol' boy buddy flicks. He gives all his friends small parts and plays the laid back dude. For that he now pockets $20 million plus a % of the gross. I said there was no justice in the world when he was worth ""only"" $50 million (after he made Mr. Deeds). Yes Grownups had some chuckles (I loved the cougar couple and the basketball showdown had some good recurring laughs and an all is well ending, but it was mostly just too predictable. Now that he's personally worth more than $300 million - per Celebrity Net Worth site - If only he'd part with some of it to pay more for scripts with more depth and some intelligent humor instead of the same old shallow plot with low class humor from beginning to end.",Grown Ups

David spade was my favorite character. because he was always hitting on rob,s daughters. i give it 8 out of 10 because some of the movie was slow. my second favorite character is Kevin James he was daring thinking he could use the rope over the water but falls funny! and how they kept making fun of rob for saying maze. a clever funny awesome comedy. and one of my favorite scenes was when they played arrow roulette and rob has an arrow in his foot. 8 stars great movie1",Grown Ups

This steaming pile is not one of them.Bunch of boyhood friends go into the forest to spread the ashes of their coach and on the way manage to learn a couple things about their sad mid life crisis's. Or something like that. I think Im going to rename Adam Sandler ""Mid life crisis man"" After sitting through Funny people which is basically a longer slightly more angry and cynical version of Grown ups, Im beginning to wonder if Sandler will ever make another movie as good as Zohan or Happy Gilmore. I reckon his time is up.This movie is filled with stupid predictable situations that are supposed to be funny. Every stereotype in the book is utilised here. And if you don't fall asleep during the first 30min you'll Have a hard time holding back the vomit for a remaining 60min of sappy life lessons that feel like they came off the story of the love boat.I have no problem with the idea that Sandler wants to spend time with his family and friends, but please Mr Sandler, keep it at home. And stop making movies about what you think is important in life. No one cares! As far as the acting is concerned, you get what you would expect from the main cast. But, performances from Salma Hayek and Steve Buscemi (Whom I believe are reasonable actors) are both wooden and hammish.

The wives all were great too, and Chris Rock's mother in law was hilarious. Even the kids, the whole cast just worked for me. I wish they had given Chris Rock more screen time as opposed to Schneider and Spade but what are you gonna do? The only complaint is that there really wasn't a very focused plot. It was just a bunch of jokes and gags strung together for most of the film. But I didn't care because I wasn't looking for a technical masterpiece. If you want to laugh go see this movie.

176,martaborows,Grown Ups,6,28 October 2014,"Young or old, this movie's for you. A perfect combination of some of Hollywood's most comedic people makes Grown Ups one of the best comedy's of the year. The hilarious script is suitable for all ages, and the light plot makes for a relaxing summer movie.Grown Ups starts off with five young boys winning a championship basketball game in middle school, following a retreat to a lakeside cottage with their favourite coach. The lives of the once passionate basketball players fast forwards twenty years, creating a story of a memorable summer which starts with the recent passing of their former basketball coach. His death takes them on a journey to the same cottage they traveled to as a team for many summers and reunites the old friends and reminds them of the importance of taking a break from day-to-day responsibilities.One of the messages in the story is that life doesn't always have epic occurrences like movies usually portray. Grown Ups has minimally connected scenes with little complexity in order to just relax the viewer's mind. This along with the beautiful setting of lakeside cottages, elegant churches and water parks, helps to serve as the perfect little getaway from our busy lives.Happy Madison Productions never ceases to disappoint viewers. Casting Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Kurt McKenzie, Marcus Higgins and Rob Schneider in the same movie was a recipe for a great cinematic experience.Grown Ups continuously reinforces that summer is a time to spend with your loved ones and just have fun, and those who can't make time for that are losing moments that could never be replaced.",Grown Ups

For that I have to say that it is quite good. the plot flows well and no scene seemed out of place and everything worked really well together. For some characters there story arcs either went too quickly and were rushed or seemed incomplete and patchy but you wont pick up on it during your first viewing. I only did after my second viewing because I was so intrigued by the movie.The comedy of this movie was very funny and I found myself laughing all the way through it. The mix of jokes for kids and adults blended well and neither seemed to unbalance it. The combination of adult and kid jokes also make it so that parents watching it with there kids will be able to enjoy this movie just as much as the kids will. At times there did seem to be one to many fat jokes in it though.The acting of this movie was incredible good as well. There was only a very, very few times when the acting was only slightly off which I am very appreciative of. Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast deliver good character interaction and also just generally good acting. There didn't seem to be any over acting in this movie and it all seemed natural. The comedic timing of the actors also made this movie that much more entertaining and funny.In conclusion this movie is great. I haven't seen a good comedy as this in a while now. The mixture of humour and laughs just seemed to be the icing on the top of the cake for this movie. With everything considered I am going to give this movie a 8/10.",Grown Ups

I dunno about these other guy's screenings(i'm pretty sure every other review here is bullsh*t), but when i saw it the audience was practically dead, near the ending there was snoring coming from behind my seat. the only good thing about this movie is that martin lawrence isn't in it. predictable trash with forced jokes and a generally sh*tty story, this movie failed to entertain me on all levels, therefore i give it a one. stay the f*ck away from this mess of a film",Grown Ups

I loved The Waterboy, Hitch, Madagascar, Funny People, Dogma, Good Hair, The King of queens, Spanglish, Punch drunk love, happy gilmore etc.So I do like these actors.

I only went to see it because me and my girlfriend got into a fight and kicked me out of the house for a few hours. I had already seen Toy Story 3 and noticed today that ""Grown Ups"" would be starting in 30 minutes. I said to myself, ""What The Heck. It couldn't be any worse than the trailer of it suggested."" I was wrong. Dead wrong.The plot in itself is about as thin as you can get. I don't want to get into trouble on IMDb for posting spoilers but there is really nothing to spoil about this movie because there really is no plot to it. It's really nothing more than just a bunch of random 'jokes' thrown together for a few cheap laughs. What can you expect out of an Adam Sandler film but at least ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Billy Madison"", ""Click"" and ""Big Daddy"" were tolerable. This film on the other hand is not.I will spoil one thing for you however. There is an obese black woman who is the mother of Chris Rock in this film. We get a nice little shot of bunion and callused feet as well as her habit of farting randomly. There are some jokes that rather fall flat such as jokes about homosexuality and so-called 'male bonding' and the film seems to insult today's 'tech savy' video game and texting children. Plenty of morbid dark humor (such as making jokes at a funeral and spilling someone's cremated ashes into a bucket of KFC.) There's also quite a bit of slapstick (being shot in the foot with an arrow) and toilet humor (Peeing in swimming pools.) Basically if you have an IQ of less than 45 and/or you find jokes similar to the ones in movies like ""Big Momma's House"" and ""Are We There Yet?"", ""Grown Ups"" is the perfect film for you.

To me, it looked like a paid vacation for the SNL'ers courtesy of Happy Madison. The jokes were stale and not well executed by the entire cast. Case in point, I laugh at any fart jokes in a movie, however, the farting mother-in-law blaming it on the dog wasn't funny. All the ex-SNL'ers were just going through the motions and getting paid. The only one who was making an effort was Kevin James, so much so, that at times, he looked as though he was trying too hard to fit in with the SNL gang (overacting). The storyline/plot was lacking and extremely shoddy. For example, we understood why these guys loved their Junior High Baseketball coach, however, after 30 years, why would a basketball coach entrust his ashes to these guys to scatter? Did he not have a wife, kids, boyfriend, whatever? That part seemed strange to me. Also, the zip-line at the water park was absurd, and frankly, outright dangerous. Lastly, cooking bacon on a bug zapper? I know where Sandler was trying to go with this scene (gross out factor), but it just wasn't working for me.

Must have been a fun job being on that set, with all those comedians. More important, I thought, was the message I got out of it with the kids. That kids need to go out and play and not be so dependent on TV-Cable-Internet-Texting-Video Games and the lot. I see a lot of my buddies' kids sitting in the house on beautiful days and they just want to x-box and email or twitter. That is why I really enjoyed the movie, because that part of it was so dead on. I believed the movie in those moments because they were real moments. This isn't one of those intellectual thinking critiques on how society has moved at warped speed with technology and how's it affected our youth, but it's kind of true and the writer got it out there without making it a political agenda in a non-abrasive comedy.

I heard this movie made over 230% net profit- about $191.4 MM net profit. That is the only reason they're making another one. Please do not watch the next one.

That's why I love it, the only ""villains"" of this movie are some middle aged guys that they beat in a basketball game years ago and that never reaches anything but name calling.All of the characters are likable and seem like one big family, the actors gel really well together and I love the ad lib scenes.

The interaction between these former team mates indicates that although they have achieved in life they still haven't fully grown up.The comedy is quite lame most of the time but there are a few laughs to be had and the supporting characters are quite good who includes Maria Bello and Selma Hayek.

However, it turns out to be a different kind of bad: it's spirited, sweet, and utterly devoid of competence. It's a slap-dash script, acted meagerly, with ham-fisted direction.If you've seen the TV show American Idol, you may have seen one of the judges critique a performance by saying that it was a bit ""trying too hard."" The singer is sincere, does everything just the way that he or she assumes the audience will want it, and yet it comes off as utterly ""by the numbers,"" and insipid. Well, that's pretty much this film. It features a bunch of funny actors who didn't have a lot of funny lines but tried really hard anyway. It's thin.

Really liked him in Happy Gilmore and thought he took a chance and did pretty good in Spanglish or whatever the name of the movie was, but in Grown Ups it seemed like he was playing hall monitor and had his fingers in the director to make sure he wasn't upstaged at any given time. Sure the other actors had their moments, but they were limited. It was Sandler's show. Thought he or the director or the script could have given a little more of the moments away, spread them around a little or better yet, create more for the others or improve what they had. Was really looking forward to the movie and I'm not crushing it, I enjoyed it and when the actors were doing what they do best there were moments of fun, but seems like there was a leash around a couple of necks or maybe the supporting actors around Sandler didn't want to overstep their boundaries.

That was until some eye candy in the form of Rob Schneider's character's daughters (minus the look-a-like one!) finally peeked my interest back into this lackluster film. Yes you might have a go at me for being another typical male, but they have some scenery there for the ladies too, albeit a buffed up Canadian who's pepped up on too much helium. And I'm aware that there is more female flesh on screen but what do you expect from a film about 5 guys and a very thin plot?

In other words, don't pretend that you don't know what to expect.After 5 minutes of this film you know exactly where this film is going and I find that quite annoying despite the amount of ""comedic"" talent on show here. In saying that, having more than 5 big names in the same movie, doesn't always guarantee a great movie. Yet, Hollywood still falsely believes this. And what is it with these movies putting a lot of their potentially funnier moments in their trailers?? We saw ""Get Him To The Greek"" last week and they were clever enough to omit some scenes in their trailer from the final product. It certainly helped with the film in the end.At first I was wondering how more than half the audience found that first hour of ""Grown Ups"" funny. But it wasn't until the house lights went up at the end of the movie that I realized that 75% of the audience were under the age of 20. I'm all for slapstick humor but far too much of it looks like the cast were just reading straight from the script. Not too much imagination and improvisation at all from a group of comedians (Kevin James aside) who did this for a living on Saturday Night Live. When others have reviewed this film and have said that, ""You'll like this film if you're a fan of Adam Sandler"" is completely untrue. ""Happy Gilmore"" was very of its time which is why many still today regard it as a classic comedy. I can guarantee that unlike ""Happy Gilmore"", ""Grown Ups"" will not even come close to being regarded in the same way in 15 years time, let alone 5 years time. Adam Sandler's time as an actor, writer and comedian are just about up for me, especially if movies like ""Grown Ups"" and the appalling ""Funny People"" are anything to go by. Now why have I given 5 out of 10 stars then you might ask? There were some moments where I was literally laughing-out-loud in the second half of the movie thanks to Rob Schneider, his more senior wife, and the cameo of the ever reliable Steve Buschemi. Schneider seems to be a natural for these types of films and despite getting hammered for pretty much any film he releases when he is the main character, he shows his versatility in this role. Very rarely have I seen a movie that advertises itself as comedy, do I find that the second half is actually funnier than the first half. So for that too I'm glad I didn't head for the exits early. The other reason for my score is that ""Grown Ups"" actually tries to send a good message to kids in a few different ways which at least gives the film some heart. The scenes with the ""phone-cups"" (after Sandler's spoilt kids are deprived of their typically rich lifestyle - no video games, no mobiles)) and ""learning to know how to win as well as lose"" are important in a child's upbringing. Seeing as this is my review, all I can suggest is, if you're taking your kids and you want a light-hearted comedy, then by all means, go and see it. Don't be put off by the usually foul-mouthed Chris Rock as his character is completely toned down and stripped of his usual outrageousness. If you are over the age of 25, then like my girlfriend and I, you'll should see right through this film very early on.",Grown Ups
200,stelmarkou,Finally a movie with big names that I enjoyed.,8,15 February 2011,"When I saw the cast I thought to my self no chance this will be a movie to buy for my DVD collection but it really is.Sandler, Spade, James, Rock & Schneider working together make it a constant laugh. Smart jokes and embarrassing situations make this an 8/10 for me.And to top it all up you have Salma Hayek in a bikini, can't go wrong really!It's one of very few movies with a rich big cast that works. Probably the first since Cannonball Run II. Standard things in Adam Sandler movies though such as the obvious happy ending, big bank accounts and about 5-6 actors that he uses in all of his films!",Grown Ups
201,nummy3,Uneven comedy,4,5 February 2011,"While there were certainly times during ""Grown Ups"" where I did laugh, overall it was a bit disappointing.The biggest drawback to the comedy in this film is that it's based primarily upon put-down jokes (which get old fast) and clichés. The put-down jokes were occasionally amusing, but the constant jokes about people being fat, stupid, or ugly makes it seem as if the script was lazily written. Couple that in with the many clichés, a notable one being that, as always in films, anyone who tries to eat a healthy diet is always freak and a complete mutant of a person, and it made me think all the more that the script was lazily put together.While you could do worse than choosing ""Grown Ups"" when renting your next movie, save it for one of those times when you can't find anything else good to watch.",Grown Ups

But I guess if you are expecting a movie with lots of meaning and a great story line... yes, then you will be highly disappointed. But hey, that's not what I am looking for. I am looking for a funny movie where I can just laugh out loud for 90 minutes. And that is what ""Grown Up"" gives you. Laughs nonstop. I really enjoyed the movie, the cast delivers one funny situation after another, just as you would expect it from Adam Sandler, Chris Rock, Kevin James and the others. I had tears running down my cheeks, I haven't laughed that much in a movie for a long time. So here is the secret to the funniest movie of 2010: Do NOT expect a great story and you will have the greatest fun!! Enjoy & laugh, that's what this movie is all about.

Grown ups is actually painful to watch.I've never found Sandler funny but he's never been this annoying either.Kevin James is just the token fat guy to be laughed at. There are so many fat jokes and none of them are funny.Rob Schneider? when was the last time he was funny?? Seriously do yourself a favour and skip this one. It's like bacon flavoured vodka.

Not Half Bad,5,25 August 2010,"so i had my doubts with this movie, the trailers made it seem cheap, such as an unoriginal story (which it has) and poor jokes (which it has). but overall it is watchable. I would call myself a sucker for these comedies but the latest modern comedies appear to lack in something but i don't know what it is yet. anyway... this is a one-watch movie, it has it's moments, and the second half is pretty good and an improvement to the first half. it has your typical characters that would make a comedy, your successful guy, the strange hippie guy, the black guy, the horny and the fat guy (which is played by Kevin James and yes you will find this movie being overdosed by fat jokes, oh god so many fat jokes). as Adam Sander movies go this beats funny people, which was a movie that had no idea what it wanted to be. but here, this was your summer comedy that has been rebooted. kinda like the 2010 version of The Great Outdoors but not as great.",Grown Ups
207,diana_bereczky,"Fantastic, Fun and Considerably Heart Warming!",7,28 November 2010,"What can I say about Grown Ups...Only positive points for this film because it is truly enjoyable. This is a movie about 5 guys who played team basketball at their school and end up going separate ways after school (duh). What brings these boys together is the death of their coach and thus begins a story of Grown Ups, telling tales of their successes and remembering the good times when they were young.This film isn't Harry Potter, Star Wars or the fantastic Lord of the Rings trilogy but for what it's worth I would like to express just how lovely it is to think back to the times when we all had fun as children/friends and Adam Sandlers film made me feel like a home sick school girl.I would also like to commend Adam Sandler for raising awareness of the fact that children will no longer value outdoor play as our world is becoming infested by too much technology. Children as young as 11 years old have more advanced mobile phones then I when I was 15 (which was 9 years ago) and video games graze their minds of maturity, seriousness and fresh air ha-ha...I know this because I spend heaps of times indoors then out and I miss the days when I was younger and riding bikes with my younger friends.All in all, Grown Ups isn't to be taken seriously and if you're going to sit through this movie and bad mouth the content within this film then I would have to question ones mentality. Seriously, even I know how ridiculous Adam Sandler films can get but this one is probably my top five favorite Sandler films. I highly recommend this film to anybody who is looking for a much laid back, family fun, hilarious comedy flick. 7/10",Grown Ups

When seeing the previews I thought with a cast like this you can't go wrong, it must be a goldmine of laughs! But after watching the movie my feelings changed a lot. Sure there were a few moments that made me laugh but to tell you the truth a lot of the jokes were over used and got tiring. I felt as if they were trying too hard to make the audience laugh and that they were trying to fit in as many jokes as they could into each scene. Of course it's not the most horrible movie i've seen. I just don't think the plot was strong enough and I don't get the same charming and funny vibe I usually get when watching a movie with any of these actors in it. I feel that a lot of the movie was also was very cliché and predictable. I do think that this movie could have been a lot better.

I did so AT LEAST 5 times during this movie, in the movie theater I should've felt embarrassed for laughing so loud, but the rest of the audience was laughing too.

I thought that the jokes were too cheap, and the writing too sloppy, with the overall effect being a lazy, over sugary attempt at comedy that just wasn't funny.There were several scenes that were badly acted, and I suppose the director has to take the blame for that. Selma Hayek's character labored the point about the tooth fairy to the child, way beyond a simple slip up. It wasn't credible, so why didn't they use another take? Each character confessing to their flaws, and misdemeanors towards the end, was just painful to watch.Using actors like Steve Buscemi and Tim Meadows should have elevated this to something; that while not Oscar material, should have been belly laughs start to finish.I felt depressed after seeing this - comedy movies shouldn't do that to a moviegoer...",Grown Ups
216,mitchel_vaneeden,Great cast gives mediocre performance,5,29 August 2010,"When I first heard the announcement of this movie I was thrilled. I usually like Adam Sandler and Kevin James in leading roles, Spade and Schneider are no actors who can carry a movie but as part of this cast it might work out for them and I'm not a Chris Rock fan but heah, 4 out of 5 should work. In this review I'll give a short review of the plot, after I will present my interpretations of some flaws which ruined the movie for me.This film is basically about 5 grown ups, who formed a basketball-championship winning team back in '78, but now lead totally different lives. They are reunited after their basketball coach passes away. For some unknown reason our five protagonists share a weekend with their families after the funeral. Until this moment, the viewer waited and waited for the movie to begin, to develop towards some funny or unpredictable plot turns, but they never come. During the rest of the movie the five come to realize their lives aren't that bad and that their '78 opponents should realize that their lives are not that bad either. And what's a better way of pointing that out than a rematch which is, surprisingly, won by the other team. A weak moral statement to end the movie.So why doesn't this movie work as it should?First, five 'leading' roles is too much for this movie. Result: very little character information and development. All characters are introduced in 2 minutes, so how should we feel sorry at the end of the movie for Kevin James that he isn't the head of some store like he told us in 10 seconds at the beginning of the movie? I didn't even know what he did until that moment. And how can we show empathy for Schneider who failed his past three marriages?Another thing which bothered me the entire movie was the fact that, let's say, 75% of the jokes were just bad. The whole movie felt like the five protagonists had a reunion but the viewer was not invited. Even worse is the fact that when one made a joke, others laughed on screen!! Felt like the first 3 seasons of Friends... An example of such a joke is when Spade makes fun of Sandler because he is fat. (a joke which will return at least 4 more times and seems to be funny to the others again, and again, and again and again). But common! Everybody who has seen Spade perform before knows HE is the one who gained weight. Furthermore, the 'Kevin James is fat' jokes are already milked in practically every episode of 'The King of Queens', so for all future movies with Kevin James a strongly suggest: ''Stop the Kevin James fatty jokes! We know the man is fat, but it's just not funny anymore.''In the same category as the latter point we can put the character and performance of Chris Rock. Rock doesn't fit in this company at all. Rock needs a movie in which he can at least say 50 times that he's black and how black people are disadvantaged by society and make jokes about other black people. I once saw a stand-up comedy show of him and I did not now one man could make so much jokes about how black people have a hard life, etc. etc in 2 hours. In this one, he is houseman, and is doesn't work out for me. Especially and the end of the movie, with his dialogue with 'the other black man', I wanted to turn my computer off. All other actors were stereotypes, so all jokes made by them or about them could be seen from miles. 'Hot clothing-designer wife has no time for kids and realizes she could be a better mom during the movie', 'ignorant hot mom comes to realizes that she should let her husband suck on her **** instead of her almost adolescent son', and 'pregnant working mom should pay more attention to her almost-turned-gay husband'. In my opinion, a great misuse of some great hot actors.I can continue my review with maybe 30 more of these point, but I guess everybody who reads this gets my point. I felt so disappointed after seeing this movie, I just had to write this. With such a promising cast...it just felt like the five leads had a great time making this movie with each other and had a lot of inside jokes to share. Too bad viewers were not invited, so most of these jokes were just bad...just bad.",Grown Ups

I went expecting it to be nice, relax and enjoy, but it was boring, awful and even out of taste in some scenes. This was the first time I wanted the movie to end soon so that I can get out of there. It was really boring, no matter how I tried to find the funny parts in it. Of course it had its laughs, good ones too, but they were too few. The movie just sinned in many ways. First, it was just a lot of ideas glued together by unbelievable links. Second, it was stuffed by too many clichés, some over used, some under developed. And really, the straw that broke the camel's back in this movie was the unbelievable scene about Adam's missing the final basket to help getting the other guy's self esteem up. Once again, big names DO NOT make good movies, especially if they get hijacked by a dull out of ideas Adam Sandler, who is also the producer. Salma Hayek went unnoticed; I thought Maria Bello was much better. Alas that in the movies you can't get your money back!!!! Not worth wasting you money or time on it.",Grown Ups

A good story turns into a bad script, and no matter how many actors you might want to bring in, it just is terrible. OK! Then we add a couple of sexy girls just to spice things up, but that doesn't really work! Well... may be with the teenage audience. So, I'm thinking may be the movie is just for the teenagers.

Most of the jokes were funny, some were stupid. But I think the movie was fun. I knew it was going to be PG-13, but the trailer looked like a PG, except for the scene when they talk about getting wasted. But then I saw it, and it really is a PG-13 movie. I mean it has a few swears and it does has partial nudity, but I still think it's a good adult/kid movie.The acting in this movie was good. I wasn't expecting them to be making jokes almost the entire time, but some of them were pretty good. And some were just plain stupid. The jokes weren't quite predictable, but you would expect jokes like that from a movie with those actors. The actresses jokes were also funny and stupid. And the kids jokes were actually all pretty good.So, I think it's a fun summer movie. With some great and some stupid comedy. The cast was perfect, and the jokes were alright. It somewhat kind of reminded me of Cheaper By The Dozen 2. Only because in that movie, the family went to a lake site just like in Grown Ups and during the film, the big family had some OK and some stupid comedy as well.

Then the 3 daughters with the third one not being an incredibly hot supermodel like the first two, why diminish someone based on looks? This movie is what is wrong with movies nowadays. I remember them promoting this movie on Howard Stern and they claimed it ""was this summer's The Hangover"". WOW were they off! The movie was vapid, childish and unnecessarily stupid but the worst part was that absolutely none of it was funny unless you find cruelty hilarious. This was no Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, or Big Daddy, this is the worst movie Adam Sandler has ever put out. I saw rumors they are making a SEQUEL!

I do now admit I found this move laugh out loud funny because to get these guys together and basically provide an outline for a film and allow them to basically do stand up and Ad lib really worked. There is a flimsy story line with a feel good message but even the actors seem to treat this like it's a stand up festival.In addition to the main actors being funny, all the supporting players are hilarious including Maya Rudolph's 'mama', bunion and all as well as Gloria, the hippie sex starved wife of Rob Schneider.I guess this movie proves that when you go in expecting nothing all you can get is pleasantly surprised.",Grown Ups

Seriously.The script is extremely tame and family friendly, none of the actors deliver any funny lines (most of the time they're picking on each other with lines as original and funny as the average 'yo momma' joke). So the only reason for going to see this movie that won't make you feel cheated is if you want to know what it would be like to go on a summer vacation with washed-up comedians, a bunch of kids, a racist stereotype (fat, flatulent, black grandmother yelling from a porch through the entire movie), without having to worry about ACTUALLY going on vacation and having any fun.I give it a 4/10 because of Norm's cameo.",Grown Ups
232,frankveer-1,Just another Adam Sandler film...,10,11 July 2010,"There is nothing wrong about this film... there is nothing right about it either. It's just another Adam Sandler feel-good movie, and if you like these (I certainly do), you will like this movie too. If you hate them for a lack of plot or the shallowness of the jokes, you won't. I just know I laughed a numerous amount of times, and I felt good after having watched it.And no, I'm not a stupid guy; I like a good plot, good acting, directing and well-thought-of puns as does the next guy. But there are times when you feel like watching a complicated drama, and there are times when you feel like watching a no-brainer.This is definitely a no-brainer, which will make you feel good from time to time. That's why Adam Sandler makes these movies, and that's why they keep doing so well.They will make you feel good :)",Grown Ups
233,mmalone-14,Groan Ups,1,5 July 2010,"This movie is terrible. What a poor excuse with all of the talent involved. I am so glad that Adam Sandler and his friends had fun making this piece of garbage. Next time include a paying audience in on the joke. It would have been nice if one joke (were there any?) would have worked. Did I mention that not one joke worked? Adam Sandler claims that he co-wrote this mess, but we all know there was never a script. Adam just called up his SNL drinking buddies and said, ""Hey, Let's take a vacation and film it for $80 million and charge people for it"". Adam Sandler plays just a lazier version of himself. There is nothing he does in his movie that is amusing, but he did manage to crack himself up in nearly every scene. So at least he has that going for him. (I know that Adam's character stepped on the line and that is why he grew up to be a jerk.) I don't think anyone told Chris Rock that they were filming a movie until after it was completed. He looks befuddled in every scene. It is a shame that he is so bad in this trash when he was so good in Death At A Funeral. His acting in this movie is the real kiss of death. Kevin James has never ever been funny and so I expected nothing from him and he delivered a grand slam. Kevin spends almost half the movie inside a KFC box. That is how embarrassed he was. Dennis Dugan did a lazy job of directing(?) this ""woodland waste"". It's like he just set the camera down and let these 5 men try to act around it. I bet he spent most of his time trying to convince the stars how funny each scene was. He should be Razzy nominated. I will skip to the end of the movie because nothing really ever happened. Out of nowhere comes not even half-baked melodrama with each couple overcoming some stupid problem. Each issue is brought up and resolved within 5 minutes and then never mentioned again! Why bother even brining it up in the first place because no one cares in the slightest. The final basketball showdown is filmed as if the entire crew fell asleep. I've seen more tension in a Dora the Explorer episode. Sandler's final lesion is worthless and really doesn't make much sense when you think about everything that has happened before it. Sandler's family was due for a loss and the evil guy was due for a win. What??? The evil guy was a jerk to everyone in the movie. And besides how do you know he was due for a win you haven't been in town for a long time. You know nothing about his life. How in the world does that insignificant game change that much? No one in the audience is buying that ending Sandler. No one. The women characters in the movie do nothing of note, are interchangeable and look as bored as they audience watching these 5 idiots try and make the lamest stuff funny. I won't mention the women by name to spare them of unfair blame. And last but certainly not least (or very least) is the acting duo (?) of Spade and Schneider. They are so bad that they make the acting in Troll 2 look Oscar worthy. Both should have to give up their SAG cards for this. I want to vomit just thinking of their acting again. They are worse then amateurs. I think both of them must be hiding a dark secret of Sandlers; otherwise why are they here. I have an idea for Adam Sandler's next movie. Please call it ""Train Wreck"". This way when it is released no one will be surprised when it sucks.",Grown Ups
234,cslsr,A return to form,9,30 July 2010,"This is an absolutely hilarious movie. Adam Sandler was starting to disappoint for awhile. Funny people almost looked like a mid-life crisis with the graphic and completely unnecessary sex-scenes. But this is a return to the Adam we all know and love. It is chock full of funny performances. The only let down in this one in Chris Rock's rather dry humor. I think Kevin James is also a really funny guy, who rarely has a director who captures it. This movie is an exception to that general rule. I was literally crying I laughed so hard. The addition of Steve Buscemi added a nice touch.

It was an average comedy movie. The true talents of Chris Rock were not used. To be completely honest, I'm not even really sure why he was in the film. He did not bring his comedy to the table. Spade and Sandler were funny as usual. I also liked seeing a different side of Kevin James. He was very funny! Overall, if you like the great SNL skits from the 1990's, you'll enjoy this film.

When he was younger he wrote and starred in movies that contained material the younger people were drawn to and would engage in on a regular basis....and that was what made them funny. Now, as we(and Adam)grow older he has gone in another direction and is making movies that can be appreciated for a different reason. He has began to enter a stage in his life(just as those of us who appreciated his earlier movies have)where you have to slow down a little bit. We have all started to get into that part of our lives where we settle down, get married, (get older...lol) and have children. As we enter these stages we should learn to appreciate this stage of our life, as he, himself, has begun to....as illustrated in his movies. Maybe he wants his kids to see some films that their daddy has made without having to ask what certain four letter words mean every 5 seconds of the film...lol.All i'm saying is that it was a good film....maybe not for the same reason as his earlier films were....but still a good movie.

238,mitchtj1,Worth a look for any Sandler fan.,6,28 June 2010,"Firstly, i am going to say that the general buzz on the internet of this film scoring 1/10 stars and the opinions on IMDb do it no credit. I was really looking forward to this film purely based on the all star line up, however i was completely deterred upon hearing initial opinions. Having seen a lot of modern Sandler films, Grown Ups provides a significant amount more laughter than films such as ""Click"", despite lacking in story by comparison, it also gave me more laugh out loud moments than the inappropriately named ""Funny People"".Being harsh on this film is easy, the story is absolute trash, and the characters are completely unbelievable, and poorly explained, by the end of the film the sudden 'character development' and general preachyness of the plot line will most likely leave you wishing the film will end, and considering the running time of under 2 hours, it really does feel its length. But despite the absolutely terrible story, the humor by Sandler, Rock and especially James is top notch and you will laugh at this film, see it with your partner or a friend and i guarantee, you will have a good time.",Grown Ups

240,Gomfa1583,A movie that brings back the true fashion of being a kid,7,22 July 2012,"I think Adam Sandler did a great job in this movie of reminding parents the importance of teaching their kids about being a true kid that doesn't consist of being inside all day under the constant supervision of a parent. He really encouraged the idea of getting away, letting go of spoiled rich kid behavior and going out and getting hurt and getting right back up and going at it again.Kids should be allowed to go outside, get in trouble, have fun, and do stuff that is just dumb and stupid because it is what makes being a kid all the better, plus makes the memories all that more to cherish.The part when the kids sounded like they were talking on their cell phones, but instead found them with string and cups talking to one another, it is one of those Adam moments that he gives the audience to say ""this is how kids should grow up, playing and learning on their own.""The overall idea of bringing back the friends he grew up with for a fun weekend was a good idea for a movie. The acting was a little bland at times but I think it is great that Adam always beings back his friends to make another great movie. The jokes can be corny at times but I think that is what he strives for, something everyone can get.",Grown Ups
241,benk2005,"A great deal better than the ""worst"" movie or comedy",8,10 March 2011,"The first time I saw this movie was with my dad at the movie theater. I wasn't expecting much, since I read all of the bad reviews in the paper and on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, as it turns out, you can't always trust the reviews! I find it very hard to believe that anyone could honestly say this is the worst movie they've ever seen - unless they've only seen a few movies.It's a rather simple story - 5 buddies who grew up on the same basketball team that won a championship, reunite as grown ups when their coach dies. While I can't say the story is the most original thing on the planet, I can say this movie has a very good laugh-a-minute ratio that few other current comedies can top. Just having 5 great comedians is enough to boost this one above the average comedy. I certainly liked it more than You Don't Mess With the Zohan and Mr. Deeds, both of which are Sandler movies.Grown Ups has a lot of heart as well. You can tell the characters really care about their families, and their coach, and are happy to reunite and see each other again. Also, there is a ""going back to older times"" type of lesson to the movie - the grown ups emphasize getting outdoors instead of staying inside all day and being super spoiled. It's fun to see how the kids learn to appreciate the simplicity of being outdoors, and how the grown ups connect with each other and with their kids.While it's not going to win any Oscars, Grown Ups is a very funny movie that is worth watching.

One theory is that i was young when I watched movies with those actors and my sense of humor was something else than it is now. But how can I explain the phenomena of still laughing at jokes in Deuce Bigalow, The Waterboy, Happy Gilmore and so. They are all stupid comedies where you don't have to think, just watch them and you get it. Or is it like I just think they are funny because in my subconsciousness I remember them to be it? About the other actors, Chris Rock hasn't made a watchable movie in years. I really liked Kevin James in The King of Queens show. David Spade......OK, let him be. And finally, why is Salma Hayek in this movie? Now shortly about the movie... it.... just ain't funny. In the end there where just disappointment.

Since I am bored, I will give you a full review.If you had told me the premise of Grown Ups maybe a year ago, I would have been stoked... ""Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Rob Schneider, David Spade and Chris Rock, hanging out in a lake house, cracking wise at each other for two hours? Sign me up! Whats the plot? Wait that IS the plot? You mean they just hang out and insult each other? OK OK, still somewhat excited, it will be R rated right? No? Hmm.""That would have been my reaction a year ago. However, I first heard about this film recently, so I fortunately didn't have any time to build my expectations for it above ""first day of school"" levels of dread. Even so, I was disappointed. Grown Ups is a horrible thing that has been unleashed on the movie-going world.I guess maybe I'm not giving this film any credit. There is a plot; seems the five aforementioned stars used to play Middle School basketball together. The coach of their championship team dies, and THAT'S why they all get together at the lake house. Sorry if its hard to follow but if so then maybe you will like this movie.What follows is an odd collection of tender family moments interspersed with fart jokes, nut shots, and fat people (Kevin James) or short people (Rob Schneider) getting hurt. Oh and did I mention the barrage of one-liners? Basically, the entire script is one big wry joke after another. I guess the writers realized nothing they could come up with was particularly funny, so they should go for quantity over quality. There are also several running gags (the not-yet-weaned four year old, the dog barking a lot, Kevin James is fat, etc. etc. ad nauseum). This might have worked, if even 25% of the jokes were actually funny.sample of actual dialogue: (wayward basketball knocks beer out of woman's hand) Woman: Hey! You spilled my beer! Husband: Why does everything have to be about you? Woman: Why do you have to be such a DICK? hahahahaha! funny right? no? anyone?Problem is I laughed maybe three times, and I'm being generous here, throughout the whole movie. The phrase ""one-joke-premise"", used disparagingly for many films, would be an accolade for Grown Ups. Oh and lets talk about casting; I appreciate the filmmaker's decision to help make up for their lack of skill by putting as much eye candy on screen as possible (Rob Schneider's daughters especially). But am I really supposed to believe Kevin James is married to Maria Bello? I didn't believe it with Leah Remini in King of Queens, I'm not going to buy it now. And Sandler with Salma Hayek? That one was only plausible because they made his character filthy rich.I could probably rant about this film for a few more paragraphs, but I digress. You get the point by now I hope.",Grown Ups

I'm someone who enjoys multi-layered cinema, hates screwball-comedy and would therefore be expected to hate this. However, I like gentle wittiness. This movie had enough of that to keep me satisfied and my 17 yr old son and 21 yr old daughter enjoyed it too. The situations are cleverly worked to bring the best out of the four main protagonists and although the fattist, sexist, ageist remarks sometimes grated a little, I still was able to see beyond that to a message which declared that naive fun with the family isn't to be undervalued.

If I wanted to hear a bunch of guys making fum of each other I would just hang out with my friends and I wouldn't have to pay for that.

Completely unfunny jokes, the fact that they used other characters laughing to make you laugh because the scenes were not funny (in the church, all the characters laugh and snigger while a character sings Opera, it's not funny, but they bring in a veritable television audience to laugh in the crowd so you might laugh along, like a sheep).There's a bit where they all get on a boat randomly. They talk for a while before the gag in the scene happens. This was so cliché, corny and sentimental prior to the joke that I actually don't remember a line of dialogue, I even said to my friend next to me ""I phased out during that what'd they say?"" And he said ""I have no idea either"". Enough said.His wife gets angry and storms off to the toilet, they decide to stay a while and she storms off with a toilet seat protector stuck to her bum. It's completely basal humour. It's not funny at all, completely desperate. The film is laced with them, as well as a comedic sidekick in the guise of vegan wannabe Rob Schneider (worst actor ever? Possibly).The amount of misogynistic staring at bottom jokes and looking at breasts is off the scale. Actual breast milk jokes.

It can't be children because there are a slew of statutory rape jokes (someone call the Special Victims Unit), and it can't be adults because there is no story. The best assumption I can come up with is that this movie was made for teenagers with short attention spans.It seems like the director is purposely trying to distract people from the fact that there is no point to this movie. The camera will often focus on random objects that in no way have any effect on the plot; moreover, there are weird subplots that are never resolved. I don't want to directly blame the visual editor because he can only do so much with the content that he's given, but this movie is super choppy. It's just not cohesive at all.I don't feel emotionally involved with any of the characters. Is there a struggle? I guess the theme of this film is that people exist, and as long as that's true, then things will happen. Maybe someone could come to a realization. Maybe that could influence the viewer into experiencing some sort of emotion. That being said, the two daughters in this film were extremely attractive (I've just been Dick Wolfed). The main flaw of this movie is that it just isn't funny. Every scene has a build up to a joke that fizzles out. It's difficult for me to believe that any writing was involved in making this film. If you want to watch a terrible movie and laugh, then pick up Tommy Wiseau's The Room or 2012.

The man deserves an Oscar because he makes me laugh. So if you read this and you want to see a funny movie, pick any of his. I recommend these ones, Click, Zohan, Happy Gilmore, That's my boy, Spanglish... Stop comparing his movies with your favorite epic tales, deep emotional drama's or the latest blockbuster that won 10 Oscars.

Adam Sandler seems to play the same character in every movie he does, but they aren't fun or interesting people like Will Ferrell; he plays childish men who thinks they are brilliant. He this method of acting seems to just be shouting and it annoys most people in the end. This film is full of cheap one-liners which like his other films do.It is too predictable, cheap and boring.i didn't enjoy the sleazy movie and if you like good movies I'm sure you wont like it either.However Children may like this film though because it is meant to be fun and exciting and its lazy comedy which children will get and wont get bored because its easy to follow.",Grown Ups

I am generally more forgiving of independents and amateurs, but when you have the talent line up of this movie you must have a better script. The premise is similar to ""That Championship Season"" and could have come off as a sweet, nostalgic comedy like Sandler's ""Spanglish"". Instead, this is a dismal failure that should wind up in the trash. 1 star for failure to take advantage of the comic talent. They are playing a trailer to sell the DVD which makes the film look like it may have some comic substance, but the takes are out of context and do not display the stupidity of the whole. Gags like having the stars show urine detection in the pool or Kevin James pulling the back off a ski boat do not advance the theme of the story. How could someone allow this movie to be made?",Grown Ups

I refused to watched more than half of it and i can't help wondering why so many famous actors agreed to take part in this. There were moments when i just felt disgusted and moments when i just wondered why on earth would anyone laugh with the stuff the characters do. I couldn't even force a smile.

Well I got that, it was exactly what I needed, to laugh and forget things for a while. Who here seriously goes to an Adam Sandler movie expecting a well defined plot\subplots or character development?

Though every minute you will be smiling and giggling. Not necessarily geared for younger crowds, but more for late teens and mid aged people.

I really like Sandler, Rock, Spade and Schneider. i also love Kevin James for his stand up and the show ""King Of Queens"". Buttt, it just wasn't very good...at all. Im a huge comedy fan but the main problem with this move was...it wasn't funny. Really out of the entire movie i may have chuckled twice. Lets see...First there was this running breast feeding gag that they drove...into...the...ground. over and over there would be some joke like ""Mommy, i want her milk (kid pointing at Hayek)"" it may have been just a scrap funny at first, but after 4 times, i couldn't take it anymore.Second, there was no plot. Honestly, none. No story, no big conflict, no climax or anything leading up to one at all. It was a few guys getting back together and trying to get their kids to play outside and all the time not being funny at all.Third, these are funny guys. all of them. they have their faults but they do have talent. i wanted to laugh, really, but there was nothing to laugh at. I went in with high hopes because of the talent in this film but they were blown to pieces.All in all, don't see this movie. Its not even that funny for young kids or older teenagers (like myself).

It just seems like all the actors were just bored one day, decided to get together, and put something together, because they needed some cash.

This movie is about him working to humble his pampered kids along with his snooty wife. Trust me, the wife plays her role well. You're egging for something bad to happen to her the whole movie. There is some odd moments in the movie such as where Mr.Pink circa Reservoir Dogs makes his appearance. Along with the very odd scenes between one of the main characters and his senior citizen lover. But you know what, it's a really decent movie to watch with the family. Sandler does the right thing, more than once.

With such an allstar cast you'd expect it to be funny for both the children and for the adults, but this is not tyre case at all. It doesn't matter that ""kings and queens"" is a great show...the cast did not put on any kind of memorable performance, more like a forgettable one, and an un- funny one, and what happened to chris rock? He looks like he is going down the road that eddie murphy did by playing these family oriented roles...and it simply falls flat. Sorry but I'd have to give this a huge thumbs down. Is one scene even funny? No not at all. You will want to ask for your money back I promise you that....just make sure the popcorn is good at rhe least.

Plagiarism,1,10 October 2010,"Sandler, like many successful people in the film-i.e Tina Feye,Steve Matin,Eddie Murphy Become so out of touch with why they were successful in the first place they have to over- compensate and just basically steal ideas from other people. The breast-feeding joke is straight out of the U.K T.V. series ""Little Britan"". Which i guess Sandler figured no one had seen. The arrow flying in the air is from ""Garden State"". Which I guess he figured not many people had seen the movie. Its not just that he stole the jokes, or rehashed his own material, the film is less than funny- negative 10 on a funny scale. And the utter waste of talent. I wished they could sue for joke stealing, he would be in court for a long time. Sandler is obviously suffering from some kind of mid-multi-millionaire-movie -star life crisis! And of course all he really wants is to be a serious actor and have his own Philidelphia. But not sure thats ever going to happen to him. Maybe he and Ben Stiller have lots to talk about, they are both trying to do the same things, caught between real actor and silly funny guy forever. Maybe they should be in contact with Steve Matin and they can all write clever plays and screenplays together! Better still Bill Murray, he knows all about it.

No laughs period. The movie starts by showing all the actors in a basketball game which they won a championship. They are children. Then we see them as grown adults. All the typical stereotypes are present. Adam Sandler plays a rich Hollywood Agent (whatever that is?) who has a wife who barely speaks English and 2 spoiled kids who play video games all day!

My only criticism about this movie is the lack of humor from the ladies. It would have been nice to have seen the women have strong jokes and not seem so amateur. They were kind of funny, but almost all of the funny lines were from the male actors. Rob Schneider, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade, Steve Buscemi, and finally Adam Sandler: you all are hilarious! 'Maize.' If it weren't for Rob Schneider's character this movie would not have been nearly as funny. With them bouncing off of each other with jokes about his wife, height, kids, etc and his toupee flying in the wind, it was side-splittingly funny. It seems like there was a lot of improv, which I love. I loved the connections between all of the characters, but I wish the 'game' would have been when they were in high school or later because the whole concept of them being 12 years old winning a game and being the privileged ones to spread the coach's ashes is a little far-fetched.

But farts as jokes are never funny; that is, when farts are both setup and punchline, they are not funny. 3) Violence as comedy. I'm not talking about just any kind of violence; I'm talking about Three Stooges type of violence (the kind that goes ""Bonk!""). Anyway, this movie is bad. Terrible.

I bought the part 1 & 2 combo disk, and after the first half of part 1, I threw the disk & case into the trash. It was as if these guys got together and started filming with no script, and just made it up as they went along. And nothing happened, over and over and over again. A woman breastfeeding a four-year old might be funny to some. But I can't imagine the same idea being funny every 5 minutes.

Lame jokes that had nothing to do with anything are in abundance here because, as someone else pointed out, there was no quality control. As more stars, like Steve Buscemi, start to randomly show up as oddball, uninteresting characters, it becomes cleasr that this was just a chance for these people to get a pay check.Hopefully this will be the worst movie I see all year as I re-implement my Nothing Less than 3 Stars (out of 5 at Netflix) Rule.",Grown Ups
307,katejesse-62061,Comedic gold -- joined IMDB to help this skewed review,10,22 January 2020,"I signed up with IMDB just to write this review -- I am legitimately perplexed by all the negative reviews. It's almost like they were watching a different film, had to double check. I saw it 2 days ago and still can't get over how good it was (esp for an Adam Sandler flick, no offense) .. I'm a 34 y/o female (not that it matters but hey, I might not be in their target demographic) who watches everything from art-house to mafia movies, as long as they're good. Last good thing I saw before this was The Irishman which was award show bait (and excellent). Anyway, this 2010 flick was a GEM filled with nonstop laughs -- it's up there with The Hangover, Stepbrothers, etc... But not only that, it has HEART and the MOST RELATABLE CHARACTERS -- such as anyone trying to get their kids outside, Adam's downplay and Kevin James' embellishment of their change in socioeconomic status in the funniest ways possible, the single guy feeling weird & just getting hammered, the mixed sentiments at the funeral, I could go on.... Moreover, the social commentary here was refreshing & thought-provoking.But my favorite narrative throughout was Sandler's attempt at ""normalizing"" his stuck up, post-millenial kids with the great outdoors and just being a kid (the 90s childhood I grew up with). His gesture at the end also really warmed my heart :)Why aren't there more comedies like this anymore? People are becoming way too uptight. I actually pity anyone who didn't enjoy this as it prob means u have zero sense of humor and/or are generally miserable.",Grown Ups
308,theboyoverthere,The movie suits its IMDb rating,5,14 July 2010,"I went into this movie without any knowledge of what it was actually about. Surprisingly I had not read any previews, reviews or ratings. I hadn't even seen the trailer to the film. Thankfully Growns Ups isn't a movie that requires ... well, any thought.It is a very simple plot that lacks any real depth: Five childhood friends are reunited 30 years later due to the death and subsequent funeral of their beloved middle school basketball coach. The five men and their respective families decide to spend the fourth of July weekend at a holiday house. The men spend the majority of their time reminiscing on the good old days and revert back to their childish antics. There is plenty of family bonding in the movie, which generally creates a ""feel-good"" atmosphere.Generally I found the film worth watching but I certainly won't be rushing to purchase it on DVD. It is one of those movies that you'll watch, chuckle at a few things and then forget about. The acting was just so-so. You'd definitely expect more from the cast of: Sandler, Rock, James, Schneider and Spade.In conclusion, if you find yourself sitting at home bored out of your mind. Go watch the film and have a light laugh. You'll probably enjoy yourself for a couple of hours. Otherwise, wait until you can hire it on DVD or borrow it off a friend.",Grown Ups

What was it that I didn't like or should I say the audience didn't like about this film? Was it the poor acting? Was it the offensive jokes? Was it the poorly developed stories? or was it a combination of everything? If you guessed everything...DING DING DING....You win! What do you win? A ticket to one of the worst pieces of Junk Hollywood has ever put out.Let's be honest now...shall we..?? I have never been a fan of these dumb slapstick comedies that Hollywood continues to unleash on us however I have enjoyed some, for example, I loved the hangover and knocked up. The characters were not well developed and the funny jokes...wait....did I mention nothing about the movie was funny!, well anyways for argument sake, the funny jokes were unprepared and lacked rehearsal. Everything about the movie or should I say piece of garbage was predictable? What do you get when an overgrown man swings on a rope near a wall??? Well, what do you think? He smacks right into it! Everything thing in this movie felt forced, even the sentimental, wait, whats sentimental about a bunch of grown men making fools of themselves, well, i'll humour you, the sentimental parts were awkward and at times, you saw yourself asking simply...why? Why are they crying? Why are they hugging? It was as if, the director sat a camera down on the floor in front of these actors and said ""make me laugh"" only they didn't, they didn't make anyone laugh. In the theatre I was in, I saw about 30% of it leave 20 minutes into it and the rest of them (real troopers they are and I mean that!!) were constantly looking at their watches and exchanging uncomfortable looks at each other whenever an offensive joke was made (most of them were offensive). A perfect example of this was when the gruesome 5 (if you haven't guessed already who they are, the five adult men who still find it necessary to still act like children) were a water park with their wives and children while the men are out making fools of themselves and the women are checking out a totally ripped man who when he gets closer depicts the stereotypical Canadian saying aboot and eh! They all laugh at him! Geez! what a slap in the face to Canadians! I took great offence to this. This movie completely missed its target, whatever that may have been and left you wondering why did I just pay money to see this??

The jokes are not funny, the acting is not anything to brag about, and the story is for the most part stupid.I now believe the friends and family who recommended this movie to me must be semi retarded and i'll never think of them in the same way.

It has a solid plot line, morals (Well hidden, where I like them), characters who grow, as well as ones who don't, and a point to prove. With a large list of highly talented and well known comedians, the movie flows smoothly and sparks a source of entertainment for most any age group/interest.

This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your time watching this...Cannot believe Adam Sandler did this movie. I almost turned this movie off watching it and I don't usually do that either. I'm not sure how anyone could even think this movie is good at all. If you like this movie you probably have terrible tastes in movies. I was angry that I wasted 5 dollars to rent this on-demand.

323,asalitur,Thoroughly Bad with Some Laugh-Out-Loud Moments,1,25 June 2010,"Some advocates of this movie suggest that it has become so maligned because few critics appreciate slapstick humor. As a person who does enjoy this type of humor, I have to say that is absolutely false. While the film did contain a good deal of crude humor that will make most viewers laugh, many jokes simply fall flat due to hackneyed writing, amateurish directing, and mediocre acting. And of course, the remaining 80 minutes or so of the film that isn't pure slapstick is remarkably excruciating. The plot has no substance whatsoever and the sentimental family-bonding moments are neither heartfelt nor cute in that corny, easy-to-relate to way. The film may have only lasted an hour and 40 minutes but it felt like nearly three hours. This is easily one of the worst in-theater movies of the year.",Grown Ups

The script is nothing short of tacky and the movie never really gives you a reason to keep watching.I kept looking over at people in the audience after one liners and everyone would just kind of look at each other with awkward, uncomfortable faces.Almost every star in this film feels past their prime with the exception of Kevin James.

Good friendship, getting outside enjoying nature (something as simple as skipping rocks on a lake) and relaxing.

If you like Adam Sandler amongst the other actors in the film, i recommend that you see Grown Ups. If you do not like the main roles then i am going to tell you now; you are not going to like it.

It was fun to spot all the well-known, as well as some lesser-know, actors, and some of the themes and scenes brought back great memories. Spot-on timing. It also looked as though the cast was having a great time. This one is even better than the previews and commercials - which are pretty good in themselves.

You knew the guy would hit the tree, or you knew the guy would hit the wall.And don't get me started on the ""emotional"" moments. Every ""true"" moment felt fake and and made you think: ""why is this even in here."" The part where one guy lied to another and the making up afterwards made me feel like it was so fake. ""Who cares?"" is what you will think in these heartfelt moments.Also, the ""child"" aspect as the adults was nonexistent. ""Boys will be boys... some longer than others"" doesn't fit the movie much at all. Acting like a random drunk or a vegan guy doesn't seem exactly childish to me. Maybe in the water park scene or possibly the rope swing scene they act childish. But not enough to fit the tag line.Perhaps I don't appreciate slapstick or crude humor as much as some people.

I though for sure after they scattered the ashes they were going to take off and do something crazy but nope, went back to the house. I was actually embarrassed to laugh at the few parts that I found slightly funny. Felt a little bad for David Spade too - he just seemed like the outcast friend and I think he's got more to offer than that. There were a couple of other familiar faces too.

Of course the movie includes cameos from all the regulars in Sandler's films, so you will not be disappointed there. I can recommend this movie for anyone who loves to let go and laugh. However the jokes are not family friendly. The jokes are for adults, which only adds to the comedy of the movie. An added bonus is the off camera relationship of these comedians, it really bleeds through to the movie.

After seeing this movie first and then reading the reviews afterward I might need to rethink my strategy. Some people really need to relax or something..This is a summer comedy and as such normally isn't going to be some Oscar worthy film. It's supposed to fun and deliver a message. This film did both and did them well.As kids, these 5 friends were on a basketball team that won the championship game. Their coach held a celebration for them and told them in his speech that he was very proud of them for giving it everything they had during the game so that when the buzzer sounded they were the champions. He encouraged them to go through life the same way so that when the ""final"" buzzer sounds they won't have any regrets. For those that need a hint, this speech is where the main plot of the film begins...Years later they all get a phone call that their coach has died and so they all went back home for the funeral. Yes, they do a lot of crude and what some would regard as hurtful jokes towards one another. That's what guys do, OK? We take things that are serious and we make fun of them. Our friends know that we have mad love for them but their still gonna get their balls broken when we're sitting around. Anyway, they do a LOT of this. Maybe even a little too much but it's all in fun.Lenny (Sandler), who is a wealthy Hollywood type with a fashion designer wife (Hayek) rents a cabin that they used to stay in when they were kids for the weekend. They all discover over the remainder of the film that they haven't really been living their lives the way that ""Coach"" would have wanted them to. They have forgotten what things ""really"" matter and how to just relax and have fun (even outdoors).The movie contains a lot of crude humor, men staring at very hot young women, and bratty kids slowly turning into normal kids.If you want to enjoy a comedy with some substance and just have fun, this movie will be a treat.

I mainly went because David Spade was in this movie and i think he is brilliant for what he is, he's an all round funny guy even when you look at him it makes you laugh. Chris Rock, Rob Schneider and Kevin James played good characters but the best character in the whole film was played by Ebony Jo-Ann who in the film plays Mama Ronzoni every time she said something it made me chuckle! The slight down side is when your watching you suddenly feel like you've seen this movie before. I know it is only a comedy but we are the people paying to watch it...so a little more originality would not be to much to ask for.

There are some moments that make you laugh but most of them are just carried out forcefully.The actors in the movie can do better than this and they shouldn't sign up for a waste of time and resources like this movie was.An opportunity for new comers to make a ""break through"", but not good enough. The same situation as with video clips for new songs - if you don't know how to entertain the simplest thing is to put a half-naked woman with a good body.

Now sure it doesn't have a plot but that doesn't make it stop from being a good movie. Plus the PG-13 rating is perfect because little kids and teenagers can watch it.I also have to ask why do people complain and complain? Multiple reviews comment about the marriages in the movie. No way someone that fat can get someone that hot! Really? It's a movie. I mean look at Avatar? No one says ""Hey, Pandora isn't real! Let's hate on it!""

Now after 30 years they have a chance to meet again. What brings them together is a funeral of their coach and weekend plan for a big family outing at a small hut near the lake. During that weekend we can see how they are re-experiencing school times, making fun of themselves and trying to show their children that they can have fun just like in the old times. Their coach's speech which he gave them on the night of championship celebration seems to be relevant for them even now: ""You know you played the game just like I was always asking you to play. You left everything you had up there on that court, so when the final buzz went out: eeee, we were champions. I want you to promise me something. I want you to play the life just like you played that game, so when that final buzz goes off: eee, you have no regrets.""Life coaching is about taking life to a highest level.

It seems like Adam Sandler said I feel like taking a vacation with my best friends, heck why not get paid for it, lets find someone to write a movie around things we want to do. Whoever wrote it, it has the lamest story line. Sure you get a few laughs here and there but many parts of it were just plain weird. There were too many characters that seemed to have just been put in the movie and they had to find lines for them so just through in some stupid storyline to put them in there. I love all these guys in the movie and I think that is what gets everyone to buy tickets or rent the movie and that is why they made 270 million on ticket sales alone, because people like these actors, but in this movie, I did not like them at all, but that is how they made all their money, you have to go see it or rent to find out its no good.

I have my own taste.With any movie, you need to see it for what it is and not what others say it should be, having said that....I LOVED this movie. In this economy, we are forced to think before we can drop hard earned money on anything not deemed necessary. This movie was everything I thought it would be, nobody is going for Acadamy Awards with this movie, it was a bunch of comedic actors, putting forth a great effort in making a movie that would bring a smile to your face. I thought they did it very well. No grandstanding by any one actor, solid group effort. Many films these days, seem to be more interested in effects and ""symbolism"" or cult following. Grown Ups is flat out a joy to watch, it doesn't get boring and it made me laugh...really laugh. With all that is going on in the world and in my life, it was nice to sit back for a while and allow these fine people to entertain me for a while. I seen this on DVD, but I would have paid top price in the movie theater to see this movie. I tip my hat to all those involved in this production. I think actors of today only make the movies they think will draw awards and draw the biggest buck,and they forget who they are making these movies for, not themselves but for us. This group remembers and made the movie with the hopes of bringing us laughter, and they did so 110%.",Grown Ups

346,cubfanallways,Painful to watch.,1,5 December 2010,"Let me preface this review by saying that I like dumb humor, immature humor, campy humor, Adam Sandler films and predictable plots. Dumb and Dumber, Uncle Buck, Home Alone 3, I'm not difficult to please.I can absolutely state that this was the worst film I have ever sat through in it's entirety and so does my wife. 10 minutes into the film we just stared at each other and said simultaneously ""This is bad"". Bad as in EMBARRASSING. We were pinned in at the drive-in and could not leave. Desperately we shut off the volume but the external speakers were unfortunately very loud.The camera work was horrible, sounds were very muffled and the humor was forced. The older kid which was still breast feeding, too similar to Meet the Fockers. And they kept going to this 'joke' again and again. At one point Kevin James was looking around and grabs a milk from someone at the pool. Very unfunny. The lifeguard calls the daughter FUGLY. Not funny, not clever. Many of the jokes remind me of just sitting around with my family and trying to be funny, with the exception is that I'm not paying admission! Please heed my advice and park at a corner spot at a drive-in if you are unsure of the quality of film you are watching.",Grown Ups
347,ranilv,I like,10,28 December 2010,After many years a movie which makes you laugh. I have been on three flights where i have seen people laughing uncontrollably loud as it is simply hilarious. If your idea of a movie is something that is always serious and get out a message this is not the one for you. However for light hearted comedy that has you tearing with laughter throughout the movie this is the one. There were 5 of us who watched the movie which included females aged between 35-45and we all loved it and voted it one of the best lighthearted movies of recent time. The movie explores how people who are equals at school grow up to follow many different paths some successful some not so. Along the way they all have issues rich or poor and true friendship transcends wealth or fame and can give you happiness. In todays context the movie gets a message across in a funny way. What more can i say great movie 100 minutes of pure laughter.,Grown Ups

Based on the cast, this SHOULD be quite a decent comedy. Sadly, it seems the producers thought the exact same thing and that would be that.But it wasn't, isn't and probably never will be that.This is literally 100 minutes of a bunch of childhood friends meeting up at a later stage in life for reasons that isn't very interesting, then they sit around making cheap put-down jokes on one another (""Kevin James is fat, let's laugh at him! HAHAHA!""). That's it. It's like being a fly on the wall on a get-together with some people you don't know and don't care about, telling internal jokes and talking about their childhood. Sounds like fun? Trust me, it isn't. And the fact that so many find it funny make me lose hope in humanity.It does however work very well as a benchmark for suckyness, so it's almost worth watching just for that.",Grown Ups
350,hensleyep,Family Fun Movie,8,23 January 2011,"With a cast of Adam Sandler, Rob Schneider, Chris Rock, Kevin James, and David Spade, Grown Ups has high expectations to be a hilarious movie. The characters are witty and the movie is filled with good natured humor. If you are looking for a movie to take your family to, this is it. Sandler, Scheider, Rock, James and Spade are five adults who were childhood best friends and when reunited, they constantly pick on each other and their families. Although some of the jokes are a little corny, overall it is very funny. This movie can be compared to many of Sandler's movies but what makes this one stand out is the fact that it is comical for people of all ages. Not only is this movie a good comedy, but it also has a touching side. The weekend at the lake brings all the families closer together and closer to each other. The relationships get stronger and the friendships become greater. This is an all around great movie!",Grown Ups

I did not laugh a single time during the whole movie despite so many apparently funny actors. It seems like most of the crew were ready to fall asleep at any time. The movie did not flow from scene to scene and it seemed like they were making up the movie as it went along. I watched it with 2 of my friends and they did not like it either. Someone had to have realized it was going to be a terrible movie during filming as none of the jokes were even funny so I'm surprised they came up with this garbage. Someone probably came up with the story in a day. Next time I will make sure to read reviews before checking out something from Redbox.

The cast is great, the plot not brilliant but who cares. It's an Adam Sandler film so it's not going to be winning any Oscars, but it will make you laugh. I would recommend people to watch this film as it's a feel good film, something to bosh in on a Sunday night.

Throughout the movie the lighting stays perfectly bright enough to think that you are there for yourself. The soundtrack is also well chosen for the action in the scenes.I think the script is also very well written, it is written in a way that helps to show and remind the audience of how close the characters are. The jokes are all over in the script and are easy to find so that there is constant humor throughout like when they are sneaking through the back of the water slide and rob tells his daughter jasmine not to fall for Marcuse's ""crap"" and she says ""but I thought he was gay?"" and rob says ""NO he just seems gay, he is a genius"", or when Gloria sees the lifeguard coming towards them and says ""ok now nobody fart"" but then the lifeguard turns out to be a high pitch voiced Canadian from Saskatoon. The actions that they make in the movie are also very funny like when they play arrow roulette and rob takes the arrow threw his foot and even when Gloria says to put maze on it and the guys still are making fun of the word maze and how he says it.It was also very well edited the cuts are so clean and perfect.

The commercials were so embedded in our brains that we had to see the movie. Plus, what appeared to be the best cast on paper, I said ""Maybe Adam Sandler's best movie ever?"". But the movie was a fail from the start. The comedy was nowhere to be found. I wasn't even sure they were using a script in multiple scenes.

If you just want a good laugh, then you can find something better than this. If you are ever tempted to watch this movie, then you should take a shower and watch Duck Soup five times.For the record I only saw part of this movie because it was food day in Spanish class and the teacher wanted to have a movie during it.

Many years later the coach dies and they all go to the funeral. Four of the people like making fun of the other guy. The jokes are about how short he is and what kind of person he is.

When they are at this cabin, they get caught up and plan a second championship game, the rich dad lets the other team win so he can show his son that they need to learn how to lose.You may not understand this review, but you need to see the movie before you can understand it clearly.

As I watched it, I got the impression that each actor/comedian was given the OK to pretty much do whatever he wanted during the scenes. The movie was awfully disorganized; I wouldn't have minded so much if it was FUNNY. But, alas, it was NOT funny. It was a lame attempt at entertainment; geared towards 12 year old. I couldn't believe that the likes of Maria Bello and Selma Hayek actually agreed to play a part in the movie. What were they thinking?

I like to laugh and release my cares for a bit. I guess that's the kid in me; I pray I never lose that children's enjoyment of the simple things. So, this is a simple movie, and I loved it for that. For allowing me to just relax, remember my own childhood, recall some of the more ridiculous moments of my own adulthood, raising kids, silly things I've done or thought or said, and that, I really believe, was the goal behind this movie.

Another slob (Kevin James) has a four year old child who demands to drink only milk that is his mother's breast milk and this same joke is repeated horrifyingly throughout the film.

But Lenny Feder, who was the most successful one, has to leave to Italy where his wife works. They start by having dinner in a place where they meet an old member of the basketball team that they had beaten 30 years ago. Then the old member, Dickey Baily, accused Lenny Feder for cheating because when he scored the last shot, his foot was on the line, but Lenny refused to argue with him and told him that they just wanted to have some good times with their families. Now he is waiting for the dinner but no one knows that he is not staying for the hole vacation. His friends get upset because of this and also his wife got upset because he made her feels guilty for leaving to Italy. On the next day, the five friends go to a place to where they threw the coach's ashes. After that, they went to play a game called ""arrow roulette"" in the forest near the lake house.On the next day, Lenny and his wife are packing for the trip to Italy. Then, looking at her children having fun, she feels as if she is depriving them from this great family's quality time. So, she decided to stay and asked her husband, Lenny, to take them to the best place where they can have fun with the kids. Their choice was a water park. The old days excitement called them to play a game against Baily's team. It was funny because they were getting old. Lenny lost the game on purpose just to make Baily happy. After the game, they old friends, their families and the other team members sat together watching the fireworks as a symbol of happiness and joy.The movie was amazing. The script was one of the funniest scripts I have ever seen. The movie teaches us to put our family before everything especially our jobs. And I couldn't see anyone else doing the role of Adam Sandler and Salam Hayek.",Grown Ups
375,oyusama,Grown-Ups - My Summary,10,11 November 2014,"""Hi,GROWN-UPS the movie stars Adam Sandler and Chris Rock. The high-school gang are getting back together after their coach's funeral.They bring each others families and have lots of fun.All their childhood memories comeback as they haven't seen each other in 30 years.I loved it.It was really funny!You should watch it and maybe watch the next one after.I normally like horror films but this was a comedy which I enjoyed.By Celine, aged 12""",Grown Ups
376,lukewaiting,No. Just No.,1,8 August 2015,"Hey, do you have 102 minutes to spare? Oh, that's funny because Grown Ups is 102 minutes long. Instead of putting yourself through 102 minutes of the pure agony of watching/listening to Adam Sandler and Kevin James laugh at fart jokes, put your pinky finger in a blender then go get said finger surgically reattached at the hospital. You will find that experience much more interesting and a lot less painful. Both physically and emotionally. How Adam Sandler and Kevin James are still allowed to make movies is beyond me. I am absolutely bamboozled that there's *apparently* enough demand for a Grown Ups 2. WHO IS WATCHING THIS?! If you are, stop. Stop. You are a terrible, terrible human being and do not deserve nice things.",Grown Ups

378,bensolidrock,"fun filled, all age, rip-roaring comedy.",10,12 October 2016,"I watched this with the lads, knowing it was going to be pretty decent as Adam Sandler is a strong favorite. Although expecting it to be pretty good, unknown to the fact that it was going to be one of the all time bests, hilarious and unique is funny for everyone although may not be appropriate for sensitive viewers. I later watched with my daughter and wife and both classed it as their favorite movie, sitting in tears of laughter. Many famous characters that you know are funny. Contains a small amount of strong language, and a few sex scenes. The script has been written with immense thought and skill, in which only the best with a sense of humour could write. joke after joke, cringes and true, this is most definitely one of the best.",Grown Ups
379,ffontescarvalho,Amazing,10,11 September 2018,"The way this movie satirizes modern education and at the same time enhances family and long term friends values is absolutely fantastic.All this joined with Adam Sandler's ability for representing and the nice jokes themselves, makes a perfect combination.I would love to watch the third episode!!",Grown Ups

381,lorian69,"Waste of talent, very poorly written",2,3 April 2011,"This movie, unfortunately, completely lacked in any substance funny or otherwise. The characters are childhood friends brought back together at the funeral of their middle school basketball coach. Then they spend a weekend in a rented lake house, and that's quite literally the extent of the story. There are some weird attempts at character plots, but it's all very shallow and unsatisfying. And by shallow, I mean it sounds like a bunch of friends got together to have a mediocre weekend and decided to hand out paragraph-long backstories to everyone and then everyone half-heartedly pretended to be that person.There are dozens of plot points that sort of exist, but nothing ever happens. Kevin James' character shows repeated signs that he has diabetes, but apparently that isn't actually a plot point. Every couple has about 5 minutes of conflict that is resolved with nary an effort. There is never at any point even a threat of a plot poking its head in besides ""here we are at a lake house."" The jokes sound like they're an afterthought and are worse than what I'd hear in a normal conversation with my co-workers. Very sad, especially considering that I like almost every actor and comedian in the movie.",Grown Ups
382,tmartenst,"Hmmmm, not so good",3,24 December 2010,"I hoped that this movie was decent enough based on the cast involved but my wife and I were pretty disappointed. It was filled with cliché statements and scenarios, similar jokes as other movies and overall bad writing in my opinion. I kept watching because I always do but I was sad that I did.By the way, I love movies and have been on IMDb for a while and this is my first review....motivated by how bad my wife and I thought this movie was.There were a few funny pieces to the movie but not enough to turn it around for us.",Grown Ups
383,wwcwhite5,Hilarious movie with great tunes and actors.,8,28 March 2011,"This movie is just what you would expect from a Happy Madison Production. Adam Sandler and fellow Saturday Night Live alumni (David Spade, Chris Rock, Rob Schneider) plus Kevin James spend a weekend reconnecting with each other and remembering their dearly beloved high school basketball coach. The old rivalry against the team they beat in school is afoot and against several other Saturday Night Live alumni (Tim Meadows and Collin Quinn). Look for many other regulars from other Adam Sandler movies. I love to look for the actors he brings in from his previous films, this just adds to the connection between the audience and the characters. The interaction between the guys, their wives, and kids is what drives this movie. The music is awesome and the story is well developed for a feel good family friendly movie. For the guys there is plenty of eye candy and the women will be pleasantly surprised with the water park scene as well. Adam Sandler and company are often under-appreciated for their acting ability because it is often wrapped in comedy. The kids and the wives in the movie bring balance and add depth to the film.While the movie will not win any academy awards it does offer Best Actress Oscar nomination (Selma Hayek), Screen Actors Guild Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Television Series Drama (Steve Buscemi) as some other great talents. Low reviews of the movie do not do justice for the decently developed characters and use of the cast. If you truly like comedy you will enjoy this movie.",Grown Ups
