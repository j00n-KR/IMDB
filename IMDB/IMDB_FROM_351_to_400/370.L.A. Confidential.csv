0,MartinHafer,not as good as I expected,6,4 June 2005,"This movie is a 1990s version of the old film noir movies of the 40s and 50s. Technically speaking, it is an excellent movie. The photography (though not in black and white) was good, direction and pacing smooth and acting was top-notch. So why didn't I like the movie more? First, I found it hard to like anyone. You don't want to like the bad guys, but having the hero have sex with prostitute Bassinger seemed really out of character for a ""good guy"" (as well as yucky considering how many other men had plunged into her nether-regions before him). Secondly, film noir WAS violent and, at times, unforgiving but it wasn't this graphic. Yes, this is probably because LA Confidential was made in 1997 but showing so much isn't so much a homage to the genre but ignoring the rules of film noir--where the viewer knew blood and sex was there but it wasn't explicit.",L.A. Confidential
1,TheLittleSongbird,Superb film-making,10,11 June 2017,"As a fan of mysteries and thrillers and who likes a lot of the cast (such a great one on paper), expectations were high for 'LA Confidential'. And 'LA Confidential' didn't disappoint at all, it is an outstanding film on all levels and should have won the Best Picture Oscar of 1997 and won more.Visually, 'LA Confidential' looks great. The photography is both audacious and stylish, suitably the story and genre superlatively. A good music score also helps and there is an appropriately haunting one courtesy of one of the greatest film composers ever. Curtis Hansen directs superbly, it has a lot of style and how it balances everything is so cleverly done, he hasn't made a better film and to me it's the best directing of his entire career.'LA Confidental' richly deserved its Best Screenplay Oscar. No other film that year came close to the film's rich character development, complexity and its refusal to fall into cliché territory. All the characters are compelling in their realism and none of them feel stereotypical or one-sided, actually breaking the mould of good cops and bad villains. The story is gripping in its intensity and thrills, with plenty of unexpected twists and turns, and very rare a dull moment.The acting is exceptionally full-blooded and there isn't a single weak link. How Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey weren't nominated for Oscars is unfathomable. Spacey in particular is brilliant, though Crowe is appropriately hard-nosed and Pearce has rarely been better.James Cromwell and Danny De Vito also shine. Cromwell is chillingly insidious and De Vito has never been slimier. Whether Kim Basinger deserved her Oscar win is up for debate, to me it was a very worthy win where she gives her role hard edge and charm.In conclusion, superb film-making and an outstanding film on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox",L.A. Confidential
2,bkoganbing,Eisenhower Era LA,10,28 May 2008,"I think that all LA Confidential needed was possibly the writing touch of someone like Raymond Chandler or Dashiell Hammett. But since those two worthy gentleman are beyond reach, this is as good as it will get for the modern cinema.Anticipating the film Crash by several years, LA Confidential is a period piece set in the Eisenhower era Los Angeles and its police department which has a history of corruption more than most. A whole lot of separate incident are tied together quite intricately as the cast's three police heroes, together and separately piece it all together.Three very different kinds of cops are portrayed here. First is the laid back Kevin Spacey who has a casual attitude towards the corruption he sees. He's also the police adviser to a Dragnet style show and enjoys a whole lot of perks that come with it.Secondly is Guy Peace who's a real boy scout, but is the son of a hero cop and also knows how to work department politics. He doesn't look the other way on corruption, he rises in rank because he turned in fellow officers and he's hated up and down the line.Finally there's Russell Crowe whose character reminds me of the big dumb son in House of Strangers played by Paul Valentine who Edward G. Robinson made a guard in his bank. Even in the days before the Miranda decision, Crowe made a specialty of getting confessions the old fashioned way. Certain higher ups, particularly Captain James Cromwell recognize his unique talents and call him in when needed. Like Valentine though he proves in the end to be quite a bit smarter than everyone gives him credit for.The beating of some Mexican prisoners, the massacre of six people at a Hollywood Diner, a call girl service where the girls are made up to look like movie stars, a bisexual actor killed at a sleazy motel, and a whole lot more are all part of an complex story that won one of two Oscars LA Confidential received, for best screenplay adapted from another source.The second Oscar went to Kim Basinger as one of the call girls who is made up like Veronica Lake. She gets all the men in this cast into maxim hormonal overdrive, especially Pearce and Crowe. Basinger won for Best Supporting Actress that year.Woven into the story are such real characters as mob boss Mickey Cohen whose arrest for tax evasion sets up a lot of the situations here, his number one enforcer Johnny Stompanato and Lana Turner who would shortly be some of the biggest tabloid fodder ever.Look also for some nice performances from Ron Rifkin as the blackmailed District Attorney and Danny DeVito as a sleazy columnist.Had LA Confidential not come along in the same year as Titanic it might have won a few more Oscars including Best Picture which it lost to Titanic. Still the success of Crash, a film with similar structure and themes may redeem LA Confidential.Not that it needs much redemption because you won't be bored for an LA minute.",L.A. Confidential
3,Leofwine_draca,An exemplary piece of filmmaking,10,20 August 2012,"What's not to love about L. A. CONFIDENTIAL, the 1997 Oscar-winning detective story about the sleazy side of seemingly glamorous '50s-era Los Angeles? It boasts an outstanding screenplay adapted from the James Ellroy novel, excellent direction from old hand Curtis Hanson, and truly tremendous performances from the entire cast.The film itself is a dense narrative mixing together multiple strands: drugs, prostitution, murder, sleaze, the media, and a massacre. Despite the lengthy running time, this film never sits still and it keeps on grabbing you and propelling you forwards until the credits finally hit. It's an exhausting, exhaustive look at its subject matter and I loved every hard-boiled second of it. The ten-minute segment that takes place around the hour mark, where the plot initially appears to have resolved itself neatly, is a mark of genius.When I think fondly of L. A. CONFIDENTIAL, though, I think mainly of the acting. Guy Pearce, sheer excellence as the by-the-book rookie, leading us through the film with a charming mannered performance. Just why hasn't he made the A-list in Hollywood after his turn here? Then there's Russell Crowe, bringing a simmering vitality to his role that's been missing ever since. Crowe is a scene stealer, and that's a difficult job when you also throw in a career-best Kevin Spacey into the mix. Kim Basinger bagged the Oscar, but Pearce, Crowe and Spacey all deserved one, too.Throw in a fine supporting cast (particularly James Cromwell and Danny DeVito), top-dollar production design, oodles of violence, moments of warmth and humour amid the carnage and you have one of the best mystery films ever made. Yes, L. A. CONFIDENTIAL really is that good!",L.A. Confidential
4,SnoopyStyle,great modern noir,9,7 March 2015,"It's 1950's Los Angeles. Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) is a mud raking journalist. He often works with fame-whore narcotics detective Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) who also works as a technical adviser on popular TV show Badge of Honor. Sergeant Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is ambitious trying to live up to his murdered father's reputation. He testified against Bud White (Russell Crowe)'s partner. Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) doesn't believe he's tough or corrupt enough to be a real detective. Bud is rough cop out for street justice. The three detectives become involved in the investigation of the Nite Owl killings and call girl Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger).This is one of the best modern film noir. It is brilliant with style. The acting is impeccable and Kim Basinger is a great modern Veronica Lake. Russell Crowe kills it. Everybody is doing great work. Some people may be put off by the many characters and multiple story lines. To me, the chaotic story only adds to the style of the movie.",L.A. Confidential
5,Hitchcoc,The Fox Is Guarding the Chicken Coop!,9,12 January 2010,"This is a great mood piece. It has a sense of time and place, not to mention some incredibly memorable characters. This is early Russell Crowe and he is really a movie presence. This has so many layers and yet it plays fairly. The people are multi-dimensional from James Cromwell, whom I love, to Kim Basinger, a really underrated actress. And, of course, Kevin Spacey is his solid self. I've seen so many portrayals of corrupt police forces and without a delicate touch, this could have been clichéd. It wasn't. We have a balance of show business and violence, drugs, you name it. We have an overzealous son of a cop who we start out hating and then begin to accept because he is driven in the right direction. I missed this the first time through during Titanic-mania, and I've always been turned off by the title (the tabloids of the fifties), but this doesn't fail to satisfy.",L.A. Confidential
6,classicsoncall,"""Welcome to Los Angeles, the city of the future.""",10,27 November 2011,"""L.A. Confidential"" is the kind of gritty crime drama you can really sink your teeth into with compelling characters and a complex story that brings Los Angeles of the 1950's to life in a big way. You have to pay attention though, because there are a host of main players all vying for attention when they're on screen, and their stories intertwine involving hookers, a heroin racket, and corrupt cops all over the place. All of the principals are stand-out, so it's tough to single out any of the main players; all are on top of their game and convey their characters effectively. Guy Pearce looked like he might have been out of his league at the outset among actors like Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, James Cromwell and Kim Basinger, but his character grows throughout the story until he leads the final charge to take down the corrupt chief of detectives Dudley Smith (Cromwell). Comparisons to 1974's ""Chinatown"" are inevitable and are all over this board, so I won't dwell on the obvious. Of the two films, I'll take L.A. for it's even MORE intricate plotting and writing. The fictional Rollo Tomasi may have been inspired by the non-existent Keyser Soze, but since we knew that up front, we see it utilized as the hook Exley (Pearce) uses to put two and two together. All in all, this is a masterful film and one of the best that doesn't quite crack my Top Ten List, but it just misses ever so slightly. Maybe if it had been done in black and white.",L.A. Confidential
7,gavin6942,I Wish This Film Had Been Five Hours Long,9,18 September 2006,"What happens when a squad of corrupt cops in the 1950s explore a murder case from multiple angles and find their corruption coming back on them like chickens coming home to roost? Who will solve the crime? Who will survive and what will be left of them? This movie is phenomenal. The only reason I didn't give it 10 out of 10 is because I didn't care for the ending (which I won't reveal). It's a world were Hollywood and law enforcement cross over and even the hookers want to be movie stars. I have not read the Ellroy novels, but I have been told they are even more intricate than this film with a lot more backstory. I would watch a five or six hour version of this film. But even so, that is the strong point of this film: multiple stories that begin to overlap. Sure, others (Tarantino) have tried this, but I think this is the most expertly done conception I've seen yet.Kevin Spacey's part as a Hollywood obsessed cop is beautiful and he fits the part to a tee. His role is supposed to be similar to Dean Martin and I can see that; Spacey again harnessed this kind of character when he made ""Beyond the Sea"". Spacey's role is the connection between the world of law and the world of fame.Russell Crowe plays the ""bad cop"" who crosses the line with sheer thuggery and an attraction to a prostitute (Kim Basinger, who does a fine job being both alluring yet tasteful). His part was supposed to be for Michael Madsen (one of the greatest actors of all time for a cop/crook movie), but I think Crowe may have been the better choice. Who else can be a natural thug?Guy Pearce... I was not sure how to take him. I have not enjoyed him (""Time Machine"") and yet also loved him (""Memento""). In the beginning, I thought it would be another geeky Pearce role and I was a bit concerned. But as the film progresses, so does Pearce's character become more lovable and impressive. You'll agree.Danny DeVito was okay and James Cromwell was insidiously delightful.Brian Helgeland adapted this screenplay. You may know him best as the writer of ""A Knight's Tale"" and ""The Order"". The Order was crappy. But A Knight's Tale is fantastic. This, by far, will go down as his crowning achievement. He may as well call up Michael Bay and go retire in the South Seas where they'll never be found.Simply put, this is the best film I've seen in at least a month (and I watch at least a movie a day). Maybe the best film I've seen all year. Don't set this movie aside, you need to put this on the top of your honeydew list.",L.A. Confidential
8,lee_eisenberg,a masterpiece in every respect,10,30 September 2005,"I can always remember ""L.A. Confidential"" as the first gritty-noirish-seedy movie that I ever saw in the theaters. And it makes me proud that this was the first one that I saw. We all can assume that movies about the inner workings of the police world are going to be gritty-noirish-seedy, but overall, it doesn't do ""L.A. Confidential"" justice to only classify it that way. Curtis Hanson created an INDESCRIBIBLY great movie here.It's 1950s Los Angeles. Tabloid writer Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) likes to advertise the City of Angels as paradise on Earth, where you can raise an all-American family, meet a movie star, or even become one. But before too long, we get to see the police department. Officers Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) are the main characters. White is the type who loves to help damsels in distress, but even he has his weak points; squeaky-clean Exley is the son of a cop, carrying on his father's work; and Vincennes mainly likes his job because of all the places that he gets to visit.Following a murder one day, it's up to the three officers to investigate. But what they eventually uncover pales in comparison to what anyone would have expected. You see, some things extend farther than most people realize.Kim Basinger won a well deserved Oscar for her role as sultry prostitute Lynn Bracken. A Veronica Lake lookalike, she's the type of woman who can lead you to new evidence...or might be planning something else.I can't try to explain how good this movie is. Like ""Chinatown"", it shows the seedy underside of something usually assumed to be pure, but never gets too full of itself to the point of being silly. Why, oh why, did the Academy give ""Titanic"" Best Picture when ""L.A. Confidential"" was nominated?",L.A. Confidential
9,jboothmillard,L.A. Confidential,8,12 September 2005,"For an adult action or thriller type cop drama, this is a pretty good chance to see some good stars do some cool stuff. BAFTA nominated Kevin Spacey as Sergeant Jack Vincennes is quite cool but also quite gritty at times which makes him quite a good hero. Russell Crowe as Officer Wendell 'Bud' White is someone who seems and suspicious and not always to be trusted, he seems like a bad guy. Oscar and Golden Globe winning, and BAFTA nominated Kim Basinger as Lynn Bracken is quite saucy and looks quite pretty. Also starring Memento's Guy Pearce as Det. Lt. Edmund Jennings 'Ed' Exley, James Cromwell as Capt. Dudley Liam Smith, David Strathairn as Pierce Morehouse Patchett and (one of the reasons I wanted to see the film) Danny DeVito as Sid Hudgens. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Director for Curtis Hanson (8 Mile), Best Film Editing, Best Music for Jerry Goldsmith, Best Sound and Best Picture, it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Director, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay. Kevin Spacey was number 4, and Russell Crowe number 26 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",L.A. Confidential
10,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of L.A. Confidential,7,20 June 2006,"The GOOD - Interesting, start-to-finish and a real visual treat if you like to see the 1940s on film. This has the gloss of ""Chinatown,"" cinematography-wise with nice period detail. It also had the advantage of modern-day surround sound. Meanwhile, the cast does an outstanding job with such modern-day stalwarts as Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Bassinger, Danny DeVito, Guy Pearce, David Strathairn and James Cromwell. All of them played interesting characters. As a fan of the '40s Veronica Lake. I enjoyed Bassinger's impersonation of her. Veronica should have looked this good!The BAD - A sordid feel to this film almost all the way through, from the tabloid mentality-narrative by Danny DeVito through all the various creeps and corrupt cops. Speaking of the latter, I just get so tired of filmmakers' almost always making the police look bad. In this film, everyone is dirty, even the only supposed ""clean cop"" (Pearce) who compromises his integrity in the end, too. They make the cops look even worse than normal by showing them blaming a black person who is really innocent. That's fine for To Kill A Mockingbird in 1962 but by this time all it demonstrates is Hollywood Liberals playing the race card again. Also, the story is a bit too mean-edged for me, with too many usages of the Lord's name in vain.OVERALL - There is no denying this is an intriguing film, glossy and slick with just one short lull and one that keeps you involved for almost two hours. So, for the entertainment value, even with the negatives, this is worth checking out, especially if you are a fan of film noir.",L.A. Confidential
11,Tweekums,Sleaze and corruption in the City of Angels,10,23 April 2017,"It is the early 1950s and Los Angeles is a great city to live in; the police keep everybody safe and everybody has a chance of making their dreams come true at least that is the Hollywood version. The reality is less pleasant; cops are more than willing to rough up a suspect or plant evidence to secure a conviction and many who dream of becoming famous end up in vice. This story is centred around three detectives; Bud White, a man who is willing to get rough but won't tolerate those who hurt women; Ed Exley, an honest cop who would rather see a guilty man go free than break the rules; and Jack Vincennes, a celebrity cop who takes payment to make sure any newsworthy people getting arrested make the front page as well as working as an adviser for a popular police show. They end up working for a common purpose after a massacre in a local diner where one of the victims was a recently fired cop, White's ex-partner. Evidence points to a trio of black youths but evidence isn't always what it seems and the detectives soon start to believe they got the wrong people. As they dig deeper they uncover corruption in the LA Police Department, high end prostitutes who look like movie stars and the blackmail of city officials.This is a great thriller with a real noirish feel; it may be twenty years old but it still feels fresh thanks to the great performances from an ensemble cast of quality actors. The story has a grittiness to it as few of the characters are particularly pure and even those who are will have to bend the rules more than a little at times. There is a good central mystery concerning who is behind the killings and when the truth comes out it is neither too obvious nor too much of a surprise. There is a sense that our protagonists are in real danger as those who they should be able to trust are the very people who present the threat. Over the course of the film we learn about the characters backgrounds in a way that makes them more sympathetic; even some who initially come across as brutish or sleazy. I can't say I know that much about '50s LA, apart from what I've seen in movies, but this certainly feels authentic. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of crime drama; it is a great example of the genre.",L.A. Confidential
12,moonspinner55,"Pretty good crime drama...but any comparisons to ""Chinatown"" may be premature",6,16 October 2007,"Sordid goods in a glossy package. Crime-drama from director Curtis Hanson concerning police corruption and murder in 1953 Los Angeles is, much like its scenario, seamy stuff underneath a classy veneer. Kevin Spacey is the narcotics officer, Russell Crowe the investigating officer, Guy Pierce the new lieutenant, Danny DeVito well-cast as the gossip columnist, and Kim Basinger the hooker whose bosses figure in the crime spree and drug-trafficking. Overstuffed, overwrought, with nasty sideline details detracting from the intense narrative of cops-gone-bad. The picture certainly looks good, and keeps its momentum up despite a byzantine plot that becomes harder and harder to follow. Basinger won the Supporting Actress Oscar; the screenplay also copped statues for Hanson and Brian Helgeland, who based their script on James Ellroy's novel. The movie has punch--but doles it out in spurts. The first hour is best, and most of the ensemble acting is spot-on, but interest wanes once the story becomes too muddied up. **1/2 from ****",L.A.

13,blanche-2,The cast of a lifetime in a 1997 noir set in LA of the '50s,10,29 May 2010,"One of the greatest films ever made, L.A. Confidential benefits from a great script (Brian Helgeland), great performances (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, David Straithairn), and great direction (Curtis Hanson). It's not easy to do a film noir in modern times that is set it in the past. All too often, the performances are too stylized or nonorganic, the direction is stilted -- the whole thing comes off as an attempt, and not a very good one. In this case, though, the result is brilliant.Basically, L.A. Confidential is the story of three very different kinds of police officers who become involved in the same case, the Night Owl Murders. There's Russell Crowe as Bud White, the loose cannon, a strong but vulnerable cop; Guy Pearce as Exley, the political, honest, by the book cop who incurs everyone's wrath; and Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes, the celebrity detective who is a consultant on a Dragnet-type TV show, Badge of Honor. He works hand in hand with a writer for Hush magazine (Danny DeVito). But they're not the only ones embroiled in the Night Owl diner slaughter. There's Dudley Smith (James Cromwell), the Chief of Police, Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), the bisexual D.A., the wealthy, powerful Pierce Patchett (David Straithairn); and Lynn, the Veronica Lake-lookalike call girl (Kim Basinger). And Rollo Tomassi, of course - an important name in the investigation.It's hard to single out any one performance. The film is perfectly cast. The three officers - Spacey, Crowe, and Pearce - are as brilliant as the characters they play are different. And everyone else in the cast is fantastic as well.Historically, there are some things that are not correct as far as Hollywood - The Bad and the Beautiful and Roman Holiday did not run at the same time; and the duo of Johnny Stompanato and Lana Turner came later. However, two elements of the film are based on reality or at least rumors - there was supposedly a call girl ring where the women looked like famous film stars; and ""Hush"" magazine, the cover anyway, looks like ""Whisper"" magazine from that era.L.A. Confidential is a story of twists, turns, and camaraderie that take place on the mean streets of '50s L.A., a story that winds up changing the lives of everyone involved. Filled with atmosphere and suspense, it's a not to be missed, violent, vivid portrait of a time when things at LAPD were (and still might be today) off the record, on the q.t. -- and very hush-hush.",L.A.

Sure this film has great acting besides Kevin Spacey (Including Kim Basinger's Oscar winning performance and Russel Crowe, Danny DeVito and Guy Pearce's performances are also good) but Spacey is just terrific in this film.  He plays a corrupt cop in the 1950's with a few others, including Crowe in a exceptional role and James Cromwell as another guy.

17,sunwarrior13,An Enjoyable Treat For Lovers Of Good Movies,10,25 February 2012,"L.A. Confidential is a neo-noir film based on James Ellroy's novel of the same title, the third book in his L.A. Quartet. Both the book and the film tell the story of a group of LAPD officers in the year 1953, and the intersection of police corruption and Hollywood celebrity. The film adaptation was produced and directed by Curtis Hanson and co- written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland.At the time, actors Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe were relatively unknown in North America, and one of the film's backers, Peter Dennett, was worried about the lack of established stars in the lead roles. However, he supported Hanson's casting decisions and this gave the director the confidence to approach Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger, and Danny DeVito.This award-winning crime drama explores both the dark side of the Los Angeles police force and Southern California's criminal underbelly in the early '50s, when Hollywood was still seen as America's capital of sophistication, glitter, and glamour. Dudley Smith is the head of the LAPD and is loyal to his officers and eager to turn a blind eye to violence or corruption within his department, as long as it's the ""bad guys"" who are getting hurt. Bud White is a police detective whose violent and cynical nature is often at war with his basic sense of decency and justice. Ed Exley is a beat cop-turned-detective whose strict by-the-book philosophy and willingness to blow the whistle on other officers is balanced by a shrewd and opportunistic understanding of the internal politics of the department. And Jack Vincennes is a flashy ""Hollywood"" detective who serves as technical adviser for the TV series Badge of Honor. He is also in cahoots with Sid Hudgeons, publisher of the scandal sheet Hush Hush, who throws kickbacks to Vincennes in exchange for being brought along when showbiz figures get busted. White, Exley, and Vincennes find themselves drawn into a tangled and sticky web of violence and betrayal following a multiple murder at a coffee shop that is believed to be part of an effort by Mickey Cohen to consolidate his hold on organized crime in L.A. This lead appears to be connected to the discovery of a bizarre pornography and call-girl ring operated by Pierce Patchett, whose women are given plastic surgery so that they more closely resemble well-known movie stars. White's role in the investigation is complicated when he falls for Lynn Bracken, one of Patchett's prostitutes, who is the spitting image of Veronica Lake.You have to pay close attention to follow the double-crossing intricacies of the plot, but the reward for your work is dark and dirty fun.With its plot that zigs and zags like knife slashes, its cynicism stoked to the melting point, the movie brings the thrill of corruption crackingly to life.Also,it is an irresistible treat with enough narrative twists and memorable characters for a half-dozen films.In summary,this film has taut pacing, brilliantly dense writing and Oscar- worthy acting combine to produce a smart, popcorn-friendly thrill ride.",L.A.

19,hitchcockthelegend,City of Angels? More Like City of Demons!,10,7 August 2016,"Curtis Hanson directs and co-adapts the screenplay with Brian Helgeland from legendary pulp novelist James Ellroy's novel. It stars Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Dante Spinotti.It's 1950s Los Angeles and three cops of very different morals and stature are about to be entwined in crime and corruption...I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job.Tremendous film making. Hanson takes Ellroy's labyrinthine story and pumps it with period authenticity and seamless direction, the latter of which sees him garner superlative performances from the cast. This is the side of Los Angeles nobody wants to talk about, it's awash with corpses, hookers, seedy set-ups, violence, drugs, racism and corruption a go-go. And that's just involving the politicians, the press and the coppers!Rollo Tomasi.The absence of genuine heroes on show still further keeps ""The City of Angels"" covered in dark clouds, where even as the plot twists and turns, as the mysteries unravel and brutality unfurls, the final destination of the principal characters is never clear, thus there's a continuing edge of seat pulse beat within the pic. It's also sexy and dangerous, the dialogue sharper than a serpent's tooth, and while the ending is a little too cosy as opposed to original noir wave conventions, this is pure noir in all but black and white photography.It won only two Academy Awards, Basinger for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and for Hanson and Hegeland for Best Writing - Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Frankly it should have won a dozen or so for it's not just one of the best films of the 1990s, but also one of the best Neo-Noirs ever produced. 10/10",L.A. Confidential
20,Theo Robertson,Hollywood Wasn`t Ready For It,7,12 February 2003,"Hard to imagine now but in 1997 many of the cast in LA CONFIDENTIAL weren`t well known . Kevin Spacey had an Oscar under his belt but hadn`t appeared in many starring roles , Guy Pearce was known only to NEIGHBOURS  fans while Russell Crowe was remembered only for his powerhouse performance in ROMPER STOMPER . In fact it sounds ridiculous in 2003 but the two best known members of the cast when this was released were Danny DeVito and Kim Basinger The real star of LA CONFIDENTIAL is the script . I`ve never read the novel but I`ve often heard it`s unfilmable . Never once did I get the feeling this was true while watching the film adaption because the only thing to strike me about the script was its intelligence , yes you`ve read that right an intelligent Hollywood script complete with violence , wit and a couple of shocking twists and turns . The only criticism about the story is the old cliche of one of the cops being a naive idealist while the other cop is a violent fascist thug . LA CONFIDENTIAL was stuffed at the Oscars by TITANIC but that`s not surprising . How many academy voters are going to love a film about corruption , vice and murder set in Hollywood ?",L.A.

21,writers_reign,Watch This Spacey,8,31 August 2009,"This is a logical extension of the great noirs of the 40s, Chandler's The Blue Dahlia etc. It's the kind of movie that Martin Scorcese and/or Quentin Tarentino MIGHT make if, as they should be, both were heavily sedated during shooting. In other words although L.A. Confidential IS violent at times the violent is only a percentage of the film as opposed to the be all and end all with Scorcese and Tarentino. Here the violence punctuates a highly stylish thriller in which several strands are artfully woven into a fine tapestry with a subtlety and sophistication totally alien to and beyond the capabilities of Scorcese and Tarentino. The acting and direction are uniformly first class throughout and Hansen's love of and respect for the 'old' Hollywood is palpable in every frame. One to cherish.",L.A. Confidential
22,Boba_Fett1138,"Next to ""The French Connection"" the ultimate cop-flick.",10,14 May 2005,"Next to ""The French Connection"" this is the best cop movie ever made, in my opinion. What makes ""L.A. Confidential"" a fantastic movie is the brilliant story and the acting by the big cast.The story follows three different characters and story lines that in a way are all connected to the same case and perfectly come together during the movie and at the ending. The story is just nothing short of brilliant and it has some good film-noir kind of plot twists and elements all set in a brilliant '50's atmosphere, also brought to live by Jerry Goldsmith's soundtrack that perfectly creates the right mood. This movie was made like movies in the '70's were made, which in my opinion was the golden age for movie making. Especially the way the story was told reminded me of some movie from the '70's.The movie features a cast with some big names; Kevin Spacey (at the time he was at the prime of his career, everything this guy touched turned into gold), Russell Crowe (who was at the time a pretty much unknown actor.), Guy Pearce (dito...), James Cromwell, Kim Basinger (won an Oscar for this movie.), Danny DeVito and Ron Rifkin. The cast is really impressive and they all give a top-notch performance. This alone is already a reason why ""L.A. Confidential"" is an absolute must see.But seriously the best thing about the movie is still the brilliant story, it is really one of the best story's and movie of the '90's. The story kind of gets complex at times so my advice is to watch this movie with a clear head and pay attention to it at all times.The combination of the brilliant story and cast is what makes this movie an absolute must see and one of the best movies of the '90's.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",L.A.

23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Very good, but too slow and overly complicated",9,5 December 2004,"I decided to check out this film after hearing many good things about it, among others that it was the best film Curtis Hanson has made... and since Hanson also directed 8 Mile, a movie I enjoyed very much and have seen several times, I thought it would be worth watching. I wasn't mistaken. What I wasn't prepared for, however, was how darn slow it was... it never seemed to take off. Maybe it's the fact that there are almost constantly introduced new characters, maybe it's the fact that half of the actions in the film don't seem to have much of an impact on anything, other than move the plot a little bit forward(a tiny little bit)... I don't know. It never really captivated me, and I found myself often not paying that much attention to it. The film is good, no doubt about it... but it's just so slow... and in the end, it seems unrealistic. The very ending seems to be set up to throw in an action scene. The plot is good, but the pacing is bad. The script is good. The acting is great. The characters are well-written and well-acted. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has so much going for it, and, luckily, pulls most of if off perfectly. But that pacing is horrendous. I haven't read the novel which this film is based on, but I think that the film does it justice... anyway, that's what the author says on one of the featurettes on the DVD. The dialog has several memorable lines, the characters are conflicted and not immediately likable, but you eventually grow to like them, the script has some great scenes... but the pacing just... no. Maybe it had something to do with how hard it was for me to tell Kevin Spacey's and Russell Crowe's characters apart, partly because they looked alike and partly because both characters acted alike. I liked this movie, but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't bored out of my mind for about a fourth of the run-time, scattered around the film. Too long and too big, in my opinion... but not bad. I recommend this to fans of Curtis Hanson, neo-noir drama-mystery-thrillers and any of the actors involved in it. 9/10",L.A. Confidential
24,view_and_review,Glitzy Crime Mystery Drama,4,25 October 2020,"My immediate thoughts about ""L.A. Confidential"" were: ""Mulholland Falls."" Both are crime, mystery, drama films about mid-20th century Los Angeles and are centered around the LAPD which is brutish in its methods. There's also an issue of photos of an important man and a high-priced hooker.Those were the similarities. Well, that and the fact they both had all star casts.
The two movies diverged after that which didn't make one better than the other. Neither film moved me.""L.A. Confidential"" centered around three cops: Wendell ""Bud"" White (Russell Crowe), Sgt. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), and Lt. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce). The only thing about them that was the same was that they were all LAPD.Bud White was a heavy-handed, extremely violent cop who particularly loved to dole out pain to women-beaters. We were made to believe that his type of justice was necessary and that somehow he was a good guy because of his rage dressed as chivalry.Jack Vincennes was a media hog on the take. He would get kickbacks from the local tabloid reporter Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito). Sid would feed Jack the info about an impending crime that was good for headlines and Jack would make the bust garnering dollars and press coverage.Ed Exley was straight laced to the point he would even rat on his own police brothers. Ed was a rarity to say the least. When he was willing to testify against his fellow officers for beating up some Mexican detainees he was made to seem like a bad guy: a weasely politician type willing to step on anyone to get to the top. God forbid he told the truth because it was the right thing to do. No. He was doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.The three of them were made into unlikely bedfellows because they all were looking for the source of a rash of crimes in Los Angeles; with on particular crime being the most pressing. Someone killed several patrons of a diner in what looked like a bloody robbery. Amongst the patrons killed was a cop and a prostitute Bud White came across. Three unlucky Black men would pay the price for this crime though we know that they were just fall guys.To get to the real killers it would take Bud White's fists, Jack Vincennes connections, and Ed Exley's conscience. To me it was a glitzy whodunnit. You strip away the names: Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, David Strathairn---and it's not a crime mystery any better than other crime mysteries.",L.A.

25,evanston_dad,Kinetic Modern-Day Noir,9,16 July 2009,"This terrifically exciting modern-day noir is like a crime thriller from the 1940s given an extra jolt of color, violence and profanity. Director Curtis Hanson created one of the best and most memorable American film to be released that year, even if it got steamrolled by that cinematic behemoth, ""Titanic."" ""L.A. Confidential"" has a fabulous ensemble of male actors cast as its cops and robbers -- Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey all do sensational work. Unfortunately, there wasn't room for any of them at year-end awards time, and it fell to the lone female, Kim Basinger as a Veronica Lake style femme fatale, to represent the film at the Academy Awards by winning the Best Supporting Actress Oscar. Basinger looks the part, but she's window dressing. This film belongs to its men.A kinetic and wildly entertaining movie.Grade: A",L.A. Confidential

Guy Pearce plays an underdog cop set to testify against other cops and their conduct. His father was a cop so he tends to do things by the book. Kevin Spacey plays an officer who allows his arrests of celebrities to hit local news. He reluctantly teams with Pearce to find answers involving a strings of murders. Russell Crowe is a good cop yet he uses interrogation to get information out of suspects targeted in an operation. Kim Basinger plays a prostitute who leads Crowe on and allows a picture taken of her involvement with Pearce. She is one of many women modelled after famous actresses. She is to represent Veronica Lake. Finally there is Danny De Vito as a sleazy editor for a show business tabloid containing celebrity gossip. They are all involved in a scheme where a trail of murders point to law enforcement. Expert directing by Curtis Hanson who previously made The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Bad Influence, but this could possibly be his greatest achievement. He achieves the necessary noir appeal underlining a theme about police corruption, and an underdog who stands against the masses and influences his biggest critics. The result is one of the year's best films. Score: 10 / 10",L.A. Confidential
27,The_Void,In a word: flawless,10,28 December 2004,"From the moment it begins, with Danny DeVito giving the audience an account of events in the style of a pulp-newspaper article, L.A. Confidential grabs your attention and doesn't release it until the credits role. This is both an intriguing mystery and a brilliant character study shot in the style of the classic film-noir. Like Chinatown before it, L.A. Confidential gained instant classic status as if it wasn't for the fact that we know it was made in the late nineties; it could easily have been made during the peak of the film-noir era. Through a flawless ensemble cast and brilliant storytelling, this film has cemented itself as a modern classic and what I consider to be the best film of the nineties on the whole.Based on a pulp novel by James Ellroy, L.A. Confidential follows the fates of three very different police officers; Bud White, a short-tempered thug that uses brute force in order to gain what he considers to be justice; Jack Vincennes, the celebrity, quick-dollar minded cop, and Edmond Exley; the collage boy that values the rules and doing what's right to achieve justice. When a shooting occurs at a night café, the three attempt to solve the mystery in their own unique way, but discover they must band together in order to defeat their imperfections and get to the bottom of the mystery. This film is very character driven, and throughout the focus is always on the three leads. We get to know them during the film and their characters are always interesting thanks to the fact that they are three-dimensional human beings. Why they do things and how the plot develops directly relates to their personalities, and this means that our confidence in them is rewarded.L.A. Confidential sets itself apart from other films of the same nature as it creates the world from which it's story will develop, as opposed to creating it's story and developing it's world around it. This allows the film to tackle it's plot from a multitude of different angles and thereby it has complete freedom to put the audience at the centre of the mystery. Because of this, the film requires the viewer to pay complete attention to the proceedings and missing a minute of screen time could result in the viewer losing the plot. The film rewards it's viewer's attention by keeping itself constantly involving and exciting, and never becoming boring. The fact that it is strongly character lead means that the film has a warm heart, and it easy to get involved with and care for the characters at it's centre; thus allowing the film to be easily to get involved with for the audience. The story encompasses many themes, most notably justice and the desire to do what's right. All three of the characters desire this, and it is only through their imperfections that their methods are different. The themes portrayed at the centre of the tale will always be relevant, no matter what period the film is viewed in, thus lending it the same longevity that many of it's fellow classics enjoy.Of course, L.A. Confidential's prowess is helped implicitly by the fact that everything about it is absolutely flawless. You could spend hours trying to pick faults with the film, but there's no point because it doesn't have any. It's surprising that L.A. Confidential so faultless because the track record of it's major players prior to it's release isn't exactly brilliant. Curtis Hanson was a director of fluff movies such as The River Wild and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, and it didn't seem likely that his career was going to change. Guy Pearce started out on the Aussie soap opera; Neighbours and his only real impressive acting credit prior to this film was a silly performance as a drag queen in the comedy; Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Similarly, Russell Crowe's resume wasn't exactly impressive either and he was practically an unknown upon release. Kevin Spacey was in a slightly better position than the other two with impressive performances in 1995 films, The Usual Suspects and Seven; but it wasn't until L.A. Confidential that he truly reached the pinnacle of acting that he resides at today. Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito have made more than their fair share of rubbish and I don't feel that I even need to go into their backlog of films. The fact that it's players came from less impressive backgrounds only makes this film more of a masterpiece as they all perform faultlessly, and it goes to show that you don't need the greatest stars to create a masterpiece.The first thing that struck me about L.A. Confidential was it's delicious 1950's style. Through it's lush cinematography, the film seduces the audience into believing that they are there in Hollywood's golden age. Through the fashions, cars and mentalities portrayed on screen; L.A. Confidential succeeds in doing exactly what cinema was invented to do; transport it's audience to the place where the movie is happening. That's part of what makes this film a classic; it does for a modern audience what films of yore did for their audiences and achieved greatness in doing so. In these jaded times, it's easy for movies with dazzling effects and the latest stars to gain itself praise, but many of them fail in really leaving a lasting impression and making the audience feel like they are in the fray with the lead characters on the screen. L.A. Confidential does not fail in that respect.All in all, this film is the reason I watch films. For all the reasons I have stated above; L.A. Confidential is a cinephile's dream. When the movie is over and the final credits role; you know that you have seen a movie, and the movie you have witnessed really is the very pinnacle of 1990's film-making. L.A. Confidential is one of a few films that truly deserve the title; 'masterpiece'.",L.A. Confidential
28,safenoe,We need to talk about Kevin,8,12 May 2021,"I thought Kevin Spacey was superb in L. A. Confidential, and I hope he isn't excised from the film in future re-releases.

29,Mr-Fusion,"Off the record, on the QT and unbelievably great",10,2 February 2016,"""L.A. Confidential"" is what comes to mind when I think of police corruption movies, especially on the basis of pulling back the curtain of Los Angeles' star-studded image to expose its seamy underbelly. It's a world where the bad guys are vicious and the cops aren't much nicer. I do hear ""overrated"" a lot (these days) when discussing this movie, and obviously, I don't agree; but I think we can all agree that this is one hell of an ensemble cast. Even when I want to single one player out above the rest, another steps up to refute that notion. Every single person is ideal for his/her character. It's a huge part of why this movie is so damn good. That, and its flawless pacing.There are plenty of reasons to love this movie, but maybe (maybe) above all else, is the setting. This period (let's say from '45 to '55) has long been my favorite in Hollywood cinema. It's partially why I take to movies like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Chinatown"" and ""Devil in a Blue Dress"". Between this movie's sets, locations, warm color palette, wardrobe and Goldsmith's score, it's a stunning depiction of the time and place. I mean, this is a nice-looking film. ""L.A. Confidential"" makes an airtight case for wanting to delve into such a disreputable world. The craft here is unparalleled.Top ten, baby.10/10",L.A. Confidential
30,namashi_1,Oustanding Work....,9,24 October 2009,"Curtis Lee Hanson's finest film as a filmmaker lies in 'L.A.Confidential'. Based on the 1990 crime fiction novel of the same title by James Ellroy, this film is a gripping tale that catches you right from the word go.A film like 'L.A. Confidential' deserves a standing ovation.... everything in here is so so perfect. Right from Direction, Production, Cinematography, Performances and in every other category, the film scores and leaves you awe-struck.The twists and turns in this 1997 classic are simply spell-binding. The climax is the most interesting, gripping and highly-charged sequence you'll ever see. The tension, the misunderstanding... everything is so well placed and executed, that you can't help but Stand Up and Clap when the final credits roll. Bravo! Performances are superb: Kevin Spacey steals the show. He's fantastic as comical cop. His exit is shocking. Kim Basinger deserved every bit of that Oscar she got. She delivers a fantastic performance and looks amazing in every frame she's in. Guy Pearce is excellent. Russell Crowe's role is meant for getting the claps and whistles, he's simply superb. Danny DeVito is effective as the journalist. James Cromwell takes charge in the second hr, he's excellent in the Kevin Spacey death scene. David Strathairn is very good; in fact, this ranks amongst his finest works.on the whole 'L.A. Confidential' is a winner all the way...

31,JamesHitchcock,Neo-Noir for the Nineties,8,20 April 2006,"The last of the classic films noirs were made in the late fifties or early sixties, but there have been later films which, while dispensing with the characteristic, moody, black-and-white look of film noir, attempt to capture something of its spirit, a development which has been called ""neo-noir"". Perhaps the best-known neo-noir was Polanski's ""Chinatown"" from the seventies, and ""L.A. Confidential"" can be seen as a ""Chinatown"" for the nineties. Both films are period pieces, set some forty years before they were made. Both are set in the Los Angeles area, as were many of the classic noirs. Both are in colour rather than black-and-white, but both have a typically complex noir plot, involving widespread corruption and wrongdoing.""L.A. Confidential"" is set in the Los Angeles of the 1950s. The heroes are three officers of the city's police force, with very different characters. The classic films noirs generally took a cynical view of human nature, and neo-noir has followed this tradition. All three men can be seen as flawed heroes. Bud White is a man of action, with a violent, unpredictable streak, not above beating up suspects he believes to be guilty or planting evidence on them to secure a conviction. Bud's particular anger is reserved for men who use violence against women; at the root of this lie bitter memories of his own childhood, when his mother was murdered by his father.Like Bud, Edmund Exley has lost a parent to violence; his father, himself a police officer, was murdered by a criminal. In other respects, however, he seems to be Bud's exact opposite. Exley is a quiet, calm officer who insists on doing everything by the book, refusing to use Bud's methods to obtain a conviction, even when encouraged to do so by his cynical superior Captain Dudley Smith. When a group of officers bring the force into disrepute by beating up a number of Mexican detainees, Exley is prepared to earn the hatred of his colleagues by naming names. Exley's flaw is that he seems too good to be true. His sense of integrity can coincide too neatly with his own advantage; we sense that he informs on his colleagues not because he cares for justice for the Mexicans but in order to advance his own career.Jack Vincennes also leaves us with the impression that he is uninterested in justice. Indeed, he does not seem very interested in police work at all. His main interest is his lucrative sideline as adviser to a TV cop show which enables him to mix with actors and other glamorous celebrities. Vincennes also has a corrupt deal with Sid Hudgens, the editor of a scandal-mongering magazine called ""Hush-Hush"", whereby he will, in exchange for money, provide Hudgens with information about which celebrities are about to be arrested on drugs or vice charges.The three are brought together by the investigation into the shooting of a number of patrons of a diner called ""The Night Owl"". At first it seems that the killings were carried out in the course of a robbery, but it emerges that the suspected robbers arrested in connection with the crime are in fact innocent. As inquiries proceed, the three officers begin to uncover an increasingly complex web of corruption and crime, involving Hudgens's magazine, a businessman who runs a brothel where the prostitutes have had plastic surgery to look like famous film stars, the police themselves, and the struggle to inherit the empire once controlled by the city's now-imprisoned gangland boss. The three have never been friends- indeed Exley and White hate one another, partly because White was one of the men fingered by Exley, partly because of rivalry over Lynn, the beautiful Veronica Lake look-alike from the brothel. Nevertheless, they find that they must work together in order to survive.Unlike some, I was not too concerned that this film did not win the ""Best Picture"" Oscar, as ""Titanic"", although a very different film, is nevertheless a good one in its own right. I was, however, surprised that there was not a single ""Best Actor"" nomination for the male leads, Russell Crowe as White, Guy Pearce as Exley and Kevin Spacey as Vincennes, as all three are excellent, with equally good support from Danny de Vito as Hudgens and James Cromwell as Captain Smith. (This was the film that first brought Crowe and Pearce, both Antipodeans, to public notice). I was delighted by Kim Basinger's ""Best Supporting Actress"" award, as this confirmed what I had long suspected, namely that she is a major talent as well as a major-league beauty. She brings a touching freshness and innocence to the role of Lynn, even though she was already in her mid-forties at the time.The success of this film is due as much to the direction as to the acting. Curtis Hanson had made some good films before this one, notably ""The Hand that Rocks the Cradle"" and ""The River Wild"", but those were both in the standard thriller mould. ""L.A. Confidential"" is something more than that. Like the films noirs that served as Hanson's model, it effectively conjures up an atmosphere of decadence and sleaze, touching upon the darker side of human nature. One of the best crime films of the nineties. 8/10",L.A. Confidential

Maybe I was expecting too much because of all I heard. But it was just OK. The acting is great, the story is fine. It just seemed a little bit above average for me.

It recently came on television again and I thought to myself that maybe -- hopefully -- I'd like it better now and see whatever it was that I missed before.Unfortunately, my opinion remains the same. ""L.A.

The entire cast seemed to fit their roles well & while none had the performance of their careers, they all did fine with a solidly written script.Not enough modern films made as well as this one.

35,Red-Barracuda,Neo-noir masterpiece,9,6 September 2013,"L.A Confidential is an excellent neo-noir detective film. Set in the 50's heyday of the original noirs, it is able to recall the past while updating it for the 90's. The fantastic production design oozes period detail perfectly and captures both the Hollywood glamour but also the dark underbelly of L.A. The look and feel is one of its chief pleasures, creating an atmosphere and mood all of its own. The story is a typically convoluted murder mystery with the influence of the hard-boiled detective novels that inspired the original film-noirs. It's a very well controlled narrative which keeps the mystery enticing while introducing the characters brilliantly. They are a typical array of types you would expect to see in such films, such as the femme fatale and the cynical cop. But the beauty of the film is that it gives us the ingredients we are used to and want but fleshes them out in ways that makes it all feel very fresh.The performances by the key players are hugely instrumental here. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are the three very different policemen involved in the case and all give exemplary work. While Kim Basinger and James Cromwell impress in important support roles. It's a real ensemble film. And with a very written script you have the final piece in the jigsaw, making this a film that works as a mystery and dramatically; a film that mixes the glamour with the darkness. In this sense it resembles a 90's Chinatown (1974) and you don't get much better than that.",L.A. Confidential

But this movie shows up is the limit and what is right and wrong in order to get the job done and taking down the bad guys. This is noir done right with some great storytelling. It really does get down to the dirty aspect to the police force back in the early 50's and has enough grime and grit to intrigue most audiences that is into this type of genre. Even if your not into this types of genre, it's still a movie that should be watched by anyone at least once. The story revolves around 3 police offices one who is a smart and yet not willing to bend when it comes to the law no matter what and is a bit of a snitch. Also sometimes he comes off as a character that cares about the image he thinks up for himself than actual integrity. The second is a hot tempered cop that is willing to get his hands a bit dirty in order to get the job done and unleashes his own person justice. The third is a selfish cop that only care about himself and nothing really matters as long as he reaps the benefits and there is a payoff. The movie will have the audiences attention because it's entertaining with it's intelligent investigation and put together well without it being way too convoluted, the way it's all connected is integrated in a way where you can't help but pay attention to what is going on. And the audiences are going to have to pay close attention to the investigation to get the most out of this movie. The dialogue is also sharp and the acting performances are the same as well. I was looking forward to seeing how every piece of the of puzzle is gonna be made at the end. And the ending is good and the puzzle to the investigation is put together almost brilliantly. So overall I am going to have to give this movie a 8.5/10.",L.A. Confidential
38,thesar-2,Don't be hush-hush – WATCH THIS MOVIE,10,1 December 2012,"(This is Part III of my ""I Love the 90s!"" special review series. From review #490-499, this being 492, I revisit what I feel are classics from the 90s. Unfortunately, one (Hellraiser: Bloodline) didn't fit the ""classics"" genre I'm referring to, but the rest, including this MASTERPIECE, I loved.)I want to get three things I didn't favor in what is a MASTERPIECE, a CLASSIC and one of the best movies of ALL TIME, out of the way. Thankfully, these three are NOT the movie's fault; blame it on marketing and the idiocy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, or the Oscar buffoons.#1 Kim Basinger does NOT belong on the cover, let alone half the cover. Not only did she play a small part, not only did she only play in just one of dozens of story lines, but the other actors outshined her throughout.#2 What's the deal (still on Basinger) with Kimmy winning the only acting award at the Oscars? Heck, she was the only one nominated! Sure, 1997 was tough competition for stars – eventual winner-Jack Nicholson was excellent in As Good As it Gets – but the three leads: Pearce, Crowe and Spacey, not to mention Cromwell and DeVito, were all on TOP of their game. Perhaps the Oscars said ""Boy, we can't pick between all of these excellent performances, so why even nominate any of them."" Of course, that didn't stop them from nominating both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in Thelma & Louise a few years back. Furthermore, she was, in fact, good, looked gorgeous and believable in her role, but she was the weakest link in a long line of excellent performances.#3 I did like Titanic. Sure. But in the 1997's best picture line up (remember, back then, they only did the top 5) consisting of As Good As it Gets, Good Will Hunting, The Full Monty, Titanic and L.A. Confidential, L.A. Confidential took the cake far and above the rest. In fact, As Good As it Gets was better than Titanic. But, they do like their grand epicsI do want to thank them, fast forwarding 13 years to this year (2010) they dissed Avatar. At least they got that right.Whewnow I can praise one of my all time favorite movies. Crowe gave his best performance in spades and layers. He'll even tell you he's not smart enough to solve his dilemmas, but still shows the depth what others say about him. Then there's the all-around master, Spacey, who added much needed humor and elegance to the film. Pearce, wowtwo words: Clark Kent. And it was refreshing from both his excellent portrayal, but also to see Clark Kent in an alternative role.In addition to those fantastic performances, Cromwell and DeVito also were near perfect. Also, you have a great score, mood is fantastic, cinematography was suburb – watch it in Bluray if you can, it's gorgeous and it contains one of the most complex and wonderful scripts I have even seen on screen. I've been told they even toned it down from even more multistory-lines from its source material, its novel. Honestly, there's so much in this movie, I don't know if I could even take any more inter-webbed , overlapping subplots.In fact, it would be hard to even give a synopsis as I normally do, but I'll try.Picture it, 1950s L.A. – a place people want to come to: escape or be noticed, get rich or die trying or to sleep with real movie stars or fake ones. The story begins with the semi-narrator, gossip-columnist, Sid Hudgens (DeVito) who pays for his storieswait, I let's start over.(This paragraph might contain some heavy spoilers, skip over if you haven't seen the movie.) There are at least 8 main leads, all intersecting one way or another, leading this way, that way, and let me make one thing clear: I challenge anyone who has never seen this, read any of the spoilers or the book to predict where any of the multilayered stories are headed. There are the cops: Suave Jack (Spacey,) Meathead Bud (Crowe,) Clark Kent Ed (Pearce,) Do-No-Right Dudley (Cromwell) and D.A., or dick-n-ass, Ellis (Rifkin.) Then there's Loose Lynn (Basinger,) Vicious(-tongued) Sid (DeVito) and Pimpin' Pierce (Strathairn.) There's actually more, but these are the eight leads. Eight!As much as I loved the (remake) Ocean's Eleven, where they also had a magnitude of characters, all with their individual backgrounds and depth, this movie handled it better. Ocean's had more than 10 characters, duh, but in reality, they focused on the main three actors: Clooney, Pitt and Damon. Here, everyone gets their own screen time, each have incredible depth and range thanks to the actors involved and each have their back stories along with actual growth.To really make the movie basic or dumbed down for one central synopsis, it boils down to go-getter Ed who's made responsible for solving a multi-slaying homicide, but he doesn't think that the outcome is true justice. Honestly, I think that's the one line that's constant as there are at least 5-6 more supposedly irrelevant plots hanging around.When you begin to watch L.A. Confidential for the first time (or in my case, the fifth or so) it just seems a little complicated at times. Even I have a little hard time following each thread, even when I rewatch it again. And that's one of the beauties of this movie: each experience is brand new. And even if you ""get"" the movie as a whole, the next time you watch it, you can sit back and focus on the crisp scenery, the richness of 1950s Los Angeles or the delicious performances. If you don't really feel you're there, quite honestly, I don't know what other movie or any film noir that will. Obviously: SEE IT!",L.A. Confidential
39,sol1218,Hold up your badge so they'll know your a policeman,9,28 June 2006,"***SPOILERS**** With big time L.A hoodlum Mickey Cohen, Paul Guilfoyle, sent up the river in a federal penitentiary on a tax-evasion rap a vacuum had been created in the city's organized crime hierarchy. Hoodlums descend on L.A, like a hoard of locusts, from all over the country in order to fill it. The L.A police Department has the head of the organized crime task force Capt.Dudley, James Cromwell, given the assignment to keep the city from having another Mickey Cohen take over the mob. Capt. Dudley does it with both ""swift and merciless"" justice in many cases not caring a lick about the law ,that he was sworn to uphold, to do it.Hard and brutal movie about a brutal time post-war L.A. With the city trying to clean up it's shoddy image by having, among other things, a Dragnet-like TV show ""Badge of Honor"" with L.A cop Det. Sgt. Jack Vincennes, Kevin Spacey, as the shows technical adviser. ""Badge of Honor"" shows how efficient and honest the city's cops are where at the same time in real life L.A has one of the worst records of police corruption of all the major cities in the United States. An epidemic of corruption that reaches into the very highest echelons of the city government and the District Attorneys office.Straight as an arrow cop, one of the very few on the force, Det. Ed Exley, Guy Pearnce, gets a call at the local precinct about a robbery at the Nite Owl Diner. With no one available he answers the call himself by driving over to see what he could do. What Exley didn't know at the time was that he would get caught up in not only a mass murder but a cover up of the killings. That cover up would go straight up to the LAPD office that's in charge of combating organized crime headed by the very highly decorated and greatly admired Capt. Dudley.The film ""L.A Confidential"" has both the clean cut and soft spoken Det. Exley and his rival on the force the brutal and Neanderthal-like Officer Bud White, Russell Crowe, end up working together to crack the Nite Owl murder case. This even after it was solved with Det. Exley getting all the credit and a promotion in solving it. White and Exley who had no use or love for each other slowly came to the realization that they were both being manipulated by forces beyond their control. With big time pimp and highly successful L.A businessman Pirice Patchett, David Stratharin, being one of those pulling the strings.Patchett running a high-class call girl operation called Fleur-de-lis has his hookers made to look like movie stars. One of them ended up among those murdered at the Nite Owl a Rita Heyworth-look alike named Susan Lefferts, Amber Smith. Also among the dead at the now-infamous eatery was Det.Sgt. Dick Stensland, Graham Beckel. Sgt. Stensland used to be Officer White's partner before he was drummed out of the department for abusing prisoners in his custody.Pinning the Nite Owl killings on a trio of inner city hoodlum Sugar Ray Cullins, Jeremiah Birkett, and his two partners in crime Louis Fontaine & Ty Jones, Salim Grant & Kareem Washington, had the case just about solved. Later with the three accused murderers escaping from the precinct lock-up and ending up shot and killed by the perusing cops, which included the now promoted Det.Let Exley, just about iced the case.It's then that strange things started to happen, with a number of former Mickey Cohen associates getting rubbed out, that Det. Sgt Vincennes began to check out the deceased and disgraced Det. Sgt. Slensland's record. Vincennes finds a number of cases that he was on back in 1939-41 that has him linked to Capt. Dudly and another drummed out of the department corrupt cop Leland ""Buzz"" Meeks,Darrell Sandeen. These decade old cases had to do with getting paid off by the Cohen mob to look the other way on their criminal activities. All this investigating on Det. Sgt. Vinceenes' part eventually lead to his murder.Everything started to crystallized before the Det. Sgt. Vincennes eyes in the mob-LAPD connection that now involves a massive and secret attempt to take over Mickey Cohen's criminal empire. An empire of gambling drugs prostitution and murder for hire,or Murder Inc, by non-other then elements in the LAPD itself! The crooked L.A cops used, when murder would blow their cover, the sleazy and powerful Pierce Patchett and equally squalid Hush-Hush magazine editor Sid Hodges, Danny DeVito, to do their dirty work. This involved Patchett's Fleur-de-lis call girls getting involved, and being photographed,with anyone who's a threat to the corrupt cops operations. One of those blackmail was non-other then the L.A District Attorney Ellis Loew, Ron Rifkin.Penetrating and powerful film with the beautiful Kim Besinger as Veronica Lake-Look alike Lynn Bracken getting involved with both Officer White and Det. Let. Exley. Both cops end up pooling their talents, of brute force and keen brains, to try to break the reign of terror and corruption that infiltrated the LAPD.",L.A. Confidential

41,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,One of the best films ever made and quite possibly the best film of the 90s,10,16 October 2007,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning 1950s Los Angeles is a place that's trying to spruce up some glamour and recognition. But it's also suffering at the hands of a corrupt police force, lead by dodgy captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) who uses heavies to force would-be crime lords out of town, and also Bud White (Russell Crowe) an abuser of power who gets his job done more with his fists than his handcuffs. But there's a new boy on the scene- Edmond Exley (Guy Pearce), vying to become seargent at the age of thirty. His father was killed in the line of duty but he plays strictly by the book and has a natural yearning for justice. Needless to say, their paths soon cross- but when some people, including White's partner, are found murdered in an all night diner called The Night Owl, an intricate web of lies and deceit is unravelled and the two may have more in common than they thought.Everyone has this image in their heads of the 1950s being a happy, rosy time, 'the good old days' when everything was decent and proper. James Ellroy is a detective novelist who shatters all those conceptions, throwing in our face an era as decadent and corrupt as now, if not more so, with corruption everywhere and everyone on the take. And Curtis Hanson has brought his vision to life perfectly.L.A. Confidential has more twists and turns than a rattle snake, a rich, multi-layered story that you can pick up new things on every time you watch it (mind you, the film's so good you'll be dying to watch it again as soon as you can anyway.) It is also completely unflinching when it comes to showing the more intense, raw parts of the story, in the most realistic, hard-hitting way that just adds to the overall great effect.He has also succeeded in bringing the day and age the film is set in to life perfectly as well, with the soundtrack, production design and costumes all spot on. It literally feels as though you're living right in the story as it's going on.And the performances don't disappoint. Former Neighbours stars Pearce and Crowe made big names for themselves here, Pearce as the fiercely straight, determined officer, one good cop who holds on to his integrity in a department sinking in corruption and Crowe as the officer more in favour of rough justice, who's always brimming with a boiling anger that could snap at any minute. The supporting cast are all on fire as well, Kevin Spacey (rising star at the time) as the show-bizzy glamour cop who likes all the attention but has his heart in the right place, Kim Basinger as the torn love interest, Cromwell as the seemingly infallible captain and Danny DeVito as the sleazy journo always sniffing where the money is.Everything about L.A. Confidential is perfect. It all comes together in the right way and everything works. The publicity and hype was always going to mean Titanic would win the Oscar, but how right that this is the film that's been remembered by true lovers of film for longer. It really is so rare for film-making to get it this right. *****",L.A. Confidential
42,ElMaruecan82,"Reinventing the ""Good Cop - Bad Cop"" Trope ...",10,15 March 2017,"You know what all neo-noir masterpieces have in common? They didn't even try to be noir, their power relied on confident directing, perfect writing and solid acting and the whole thing just looked fresh, original and possibly the best thing for a movie: to be watchable and re-watchable. This is ""L.A. Confidential"" in a nutshell, one of the best movies of the 90's.Adapted from a novel by James Ellroy, the plot is the kind of masterpiece of stylish complexity that is just too labyrinthine for the big screen, yet Curtis Hanson compresses everything into a neat episodic structure so that by the end of each act, we've progressed in the comprehension of what is going on and the changes it has on the main protagonists. As a matter of fact, the characterization matters more than the investigation, which is saying a lot because the investigation surrounding a massacre at a seedy night-club (naturally, only the tip of the iceberg), is captivating as hell.But let's get back to the characters, this is the meatiest part of the film. ""L.A. Confidential"" focuses on three cops who couldn't have been more different: Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and Bud White (Russell Crowe).Vincennes is a consultant for a ""Dragnet""-like show called ""Badge of Honor"", which makes him a movie star by proxy. What does that mean? Simply that in the early 50's, Hollywood became the new Sodom what's with all the booze, drugs, the criminal wave following the arrest of local mobster Mickey Cohen and of course trashy star-studded tabloids' headlines covered by Hush-Hush magazine editor Sid Hudgens (Danny De Vito). Vincennes embraced the sleaziness of the city without letting its soil his nice suit, he bribes, blackmails and takes ethical shortcuts but never at the expenses of law enforcement. As his Captain smartly advises ""don't try to do the right thing, you haven't had the practice"", sill, Vincent might not be clean but he's the essence of cool, so we forgive him.Exley is the steely ambitious college-boy whose glasses and 'Holier-than-thou' attitude earns him a range of reactions that go from tacit suspicion to sheer contempt; it also earns him his first promotion thanks to a fine tactical move. Exley might not be likable but he's not despicable either because we admire a cop who'd trade popularity for principles. Finally, Bud White strikes as the anti-Exley, this is a guy who hits first and asks the questions later, he doesn't rat on his partners and is known for his particular hatred toward woman-beaters. He happens to be the right-hand man of Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) and occasionally, the right-fist man when some punchy methods are required against criminals. And at the top of the pyramid, Dudley Smith makes good use of White's brutal force and Exley's by-the-book standards. He knows pretty well how to use his boys like so many pieces of a chess game and even dispose of some nuisance when comes a risk to compromise the image of LAPD.So from this gallery of original character, It all comes down to one pivotal moment where our opinions are challenged. Exley stop to be an ambitious opportunist, but a man with a personal record to settle and who knows how to be tough and bad-ass, White shows a warmer side of him notably through his interactions with a hooker named Lynn (Kim Basinger) and Vincennes also has a moment of realization, that can't be spoiled. The film is about three men who become aware of their limitations but move forward, because there's always a line you mustn't cross. Speaking of Basinger, she won her Oscar for her performance as Lynn, a hooker who screams 'femme fatale' but whispers an emotional fragility that channels Faye Dunaway in ""Chinatown"". In fact, she embodies one essential aspect of the film; nothing is exactly what it seems.This notion serves one of the film's many subplots, involving a doctor, played by David Strathairn, turning escort-girls into celebrities' lookalikes. The confusion culminates with an embarrassing but hilarious mistake committed by Excel, one. that shows how cinema, police and crime were easily interlocked, and that the city of angels couldn't do without a few devils here and there. The omnipresence of corruption is persistent in the plot and it's less a matter than realizing who is bad and who is not, but to which extent they are. And you can't get to such multi-layered level complexity without top-notch acting. It is a credit to the late Hanson to have cast the two fresh faces of Pearce and Crowe to star in an American period picture. Speaking of these two actors, one of the many delights of ""L.A. Confidential"" is to see these rivals with diverging methods realizing that they serve the same case and need to cooperate.The screenplay (second Oscar-winning category) is quite self-conscious about the way it retreads the good cop / bad cop cliché, so it uses a scene that reinvents the trope in such an inventive and brutal way, ""L.A. Confidential"" becomes immune to any comparison. When a pompous big shot ends up panting in a fetal positions, you know these guys mean business.Well, that's what ""L.A. Confidential"" in a nutshell, a movie that means business with guys who learn a thing or two in the process. It might get a little conventional during the climactic showdown but to say something that can only be applied to the best noir movies: it's not the destination that counts, but the journey.",L.A. Confidential
43,paul2001sw-1,A darker shade of noir,9,21 December 2004,"Three bad cops, each repugnant in their own ways: these are the central characters of James Ellroy's 'L.A. Confidential', a gem of a book for those who like their thrillers ultra-tough and equally byzantine. If Ellroy has a weakness, it's a tendency to excess, both in tone and in plotting. Part of the reason Curtis Hanson's film of the novel is quite so entertaining is that he makes two spot on choices. Firstly, the mood of his movie is two parts hard-boiled realism to one part cartoon, which perfectly matches the book. Secondly, the greatest meanderings of the labyrinthine story are pared down, without sacrificing the complex essence (and essential complexity) of the tale. He also gets a string of great performances from his stars, hamming it up just enough but never too far: Russell Crowe does his usual meat-head with a heart role, Kim Basinger plays a femme fatale but most enjoyable is the double act of Danny de Vito and Kevin Spacey. James Cromwell is also good, although he seems confused as to whether he is Irish or Welsh! The result is utterly gripping and enormous fun, but it's no 'French Connection': ultimately, the film is far kinder on its violent hero Bud White (Crowe) than that other film is on Popeye Doyle, and the good versus bad ending is more conventional than the first two thirds of the film (or indeed, than the book's own, more confused, conclusion). But it's still a show of the highest class.",L.A. Confidential

What captivated me about this movie is great acting, masterful directing, and just a wonderful, well-written screenplay.This film is a mixture of police corruption and Hollywood celebrities that shaped the city of Los Angeles in the early 1950's.The acting is just fantastic. The three lead actors of Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pearce gave the best performances of their careers. I loved Russell Crowe who is a tough guy but with a soft heart for women. Also, Kim Basinger and James Cromwell gave memorable performances.Overall, this is a great mystery thriller that has a nice plot twist, a common theme for films of the 1990's.

From beginning to end of the best cop flicks ever shot anywhere and while I gave it a perfect 10, the current IMDb rating (8.3) is pretty darn close. Crowe and Spacey, two Oscar winners in their own right, as cops, that's enough to make you want to sign up for the force yourself. The other reviewers are right, this film was CHEATED in all the awards categories that year; in decades to come, will viewers want to get seasick one more time on the Titanic -- a story where we know exactly what is going to happen before it does -- or will they want to watch this story unfold moment by moment..? To this reviewer the larger ""crime"" in this ""crime tale"" is Pearce. How good was he here as Exley? How hot is the sun? How high is the sky? He gave the single best performance of his life here and the buzz was that it would launch him into other projects...? But for some reason that never happened. Pearce did a few name films here and there (a forgettable remake of Monte Cristo for example) and even went back to AussieLand to pick up work there, but never again (sorry to say) flew the heights he flew here.

The film focuses on three different types of cops played by Spacey, Crowe, and Pearce, and all three actors turn in fine performances, along with Basinger, who won an Oscar for playing a prostitute who's a Veronica Lake look-alike. The set pieces and cinematography effectively evoke the period. It recalls the great film noirs of the 1940s.

50,The-Sarkologist,Uncovering the dark side of Hollywood glitz,9,7 June 2013,"Every so often the Americans can make a good movie, sometimes they can make a movie with such depth and meaning to character you wonder if Hollywood actually had anything to do with it. L.A. Confidential is a movie that begins with a very solid background, believable characters and leads you through a world that is meant to shock, though this movie does not work on shock value alone. It has been based on the book by the same name by James Ellroy, and from what I have read the book goes much deeper than the movie does, and this movie is very deep.The time in 1950's and Los Angeles is booming. Everybody wants to come for it is a paradise where the movie stars dazzle and the sun always shines, but beneath this glamour there is the crime lord Mickey Cohen, but in true Los Angeles style he is arrested in the same manner as was Al Capone and his is locked away for a long time. Thus the movie begins by showing us, the viewers, all of the glitz and glamour that makes up Los Angeles of the 1950's. But this glitz isn't going to be around for long, for it is quickly scrapped off to reveal a very dirty and corrupt underside.The 1950's was a time when everything was supposed to be wonderful. Hitler had finally be destroyed and the freedom of the United States was running strong. Drugs and homosexuality, prostitution and government corruption did not exist in the minds of the everyday person. The movie works to undermine this completely for throughout L.A. Confidential we are continually confronted with these elements. We have high-class prostitutes cut to look like movie stars, corrupted government officials and a police force that is beginning to show signs of what will happen in twenty to forty years time with two Los Angeles Riots.Everybody in L.A. Confidential is white, except for the occasional Hispanic and Negro. This is a statement in itself for racial segregation seem to be strong back then. We notice that all of this Hollywood glamour is all focused on the Anglo-Saxon's world. The only Hispanic in the movie are three Mexicans who are beaten up in the gaol cells and the four Negroes are violent thugs which have kidnapped and raped a Mexican girl. The Mexican girl even says ""I lied because I am a Mexican and nobody cares about a Mexican."" The movie focuses around three cops, but the good guys and the bad guys are not at all clear cut. There is Bud White (Russel Crowe) who is a thug of a cop who hates women bashers. He begins as a strong arm for the Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell – who played the farmer in Babe but now plays a completely different role) and as the corruption begins to grow we notice how White begins to change. This begins to come more evident when he meets Lynn Bracken (Kym Bassinger) a prostitute cut to look like Veronica White, and falls in love with her. Then there is the rookie Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) who comes onto the police force with the idea of being a cop of honour and integrity and also a detective. He refuses to bow to the corrupting forces of the police force, and even alienates himself from the rest of the department to stand up to what he believes is right. His vision of the police force begins to stain through the movie as he begins to see the corruption inside and outside the force. He begins believing that he must be honourable and realises at the end that honour must be thrown away for justice to be done. Finally there is Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) who is a vice cop that is on the payroll of magazine editor Sid Hudgeons (Danny De Vito) who pays Jack $50 to arrest people for the purpose of a story for his tabloid Hush Hush. Jack is also an adviser on a TV show called Badge of Honour, which is little more than a propaganderous creation designed to make people believe that the police force is clean and beautiful and is there to serve and to protect.It is interesting though because one of the key issues that faces the police force in this movie is public relations. The brawl in the cells comes down to how are the police going to deal with it without staining the reputation of the police force. Nobody wants to testify, except Ed Exely, and through his help, they come up with a plan of dismissing one officer and forcing a few others to retire.L.A. Confidential is a masterpiece of a movie. It was in the cinemas in Australia for over 5 months which is a incredibly good stretch for a movie. In my opinion is supersedes Titanic as a movie for it is not Hollywood hype but rather a movie that removes the hype to show the reality. It received two Academy Awards, which I would say is an achievement, especially in a year in which Titanic dominated it. In my opinion, L.A. Confidential is superb and should have received more.",L.A. Confidential
51,sol-,My brief review of the film,8,14 December 2005,"Overall, there is no doubt that this is a good film, and the final half hour is very thrilling, with an excellent conclusion. It unfortunately takes quite a while to reach this point, and in the meantime the film fails to do anything particularly special. On the positive side, it is intriguing, with a complex web of events, the editing gives the film an appropriately exciting style, and the sound recording, whether it be office noises or gunshots, is always on the mark. A couple of things that the film failed to do for me were setting up a feel for the 1950s (the film looks too modern, and there are few indicators of the time period) and maintaining dramatic tension. James Cromwell looks so goofy in his role, and some parts of the film towards the beginning seemed to indicate comedy, in particular with Danny DeVito's character. Guy Pearce is the best of the cast, though perhaps the only one who pulls off a great performance. Kim Basinger won an Oscar, but perhaps for the film's reputation more than anything else. Other than looking a lot like Veronica Lake, there is little else to her role. The violence in the film does not work either. It is too graphic for it to be any dedication to noir, and it is so over-the-top at times that it is as goofy James Cromwell's character is. Perhaps the big problem though is working at what it is trying to say as a film. It is a study of the police force: corruption and working one's way to the top, but these ideas are only really fleshed out towards the end. The film's insight into detective work is good nevertheless, and at the least the film is able to end solidly. So yes, it is a good film with a great conclusion, but the path to getting there could have been improved upon perhaps. I have not read the novel, so maybe that is another thing? Some say that it is a rather good adaptation. Either way, the film is worth a go.",L.A. Confidential
52,briancham1994,Terrific noir,8,8 July 2021,"This film is a great noir film that hits all the right notes. The setting is brought to life with extensive details and celebrity culture. The acting is great and all the characters have emotional depth. The plot is full of mystery, twists and turns. What starts out as a diner shootout turns into something much deeper where nobody knows what is really going on and who is responsible. The best part of this film is how it weaves together so many threads and characters together in a slick way that is easy to follow, raises the stakes and becomes clear by the end.",L.A. Confidential
53,tomgillespie2002,Still thrilling cinema 18 years on,8,21 November 2015,"Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential is a now long-established movie classic, regularly featuring in the various Top 100 lists drummed up by magazines and websites. But despite the impeccable performances from the film's three leads and writers Hanson and Brian Hengeland's firm grip on the labyrinthine plot, something about the film has never quite sat right with me. Don't get me wrong, I still think this is fantastic cinema and I've adored the few James Ellroy novels I've read (L.A. Confidential is adapted from the third book of his 'L.A. Quartet'), but some corny dialogue and flat cinematography weigh down what is ultimately an absorbing character piece.There are a million stories in the city and it is the job of Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), the editor of trashy magazine Hush-Hush, to find them. Celebrity cop Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) works on the side as 'technical adviser' for cop show Badge of Honor and is paid by Hudgens to bust celebrities in all sorts of compromising situations. It's Christmas, and Bud White (Russell Crowe) is buying liquor for the station when he stops by a house and beats on a man for doing the same to his wife. At the station, ambitious young cop Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is determined to live up to his father's reputation and refuses to be drawn in to the various exploits of his corrupt colleagues. When a group of Mexicans are brought in for assaulting two officers, the drunken officers assault them and the story hits the newspapers.It's difficult to summarise the plot as the film is always moving forward, putting many pieces into play to the point where you struggle to figure out how it will all link together. The main crux of the film lies with a massacre at a diner called the Nite Owl, where many are killed along with White's ex-partner Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel) and a girl White met at Christmas. She looked beaten up, but Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) assured him it wasn't what he thought. Also, with her at Christmas was Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), a millionaire who runs an agency of hookers made to look like movie stars by plastic surgery. After the incident with the Mexicans, Exley becomes despised by his colleagues for testifying against those involved, particularly angering White after Stensland was shown the door, and forcing Vincennes to testify by threatening his work on Badge of Honor.Acting out almost like vignettes, the various pieces of the puzzle stay apart for the majority of the film, and it's difficult to figure out what the plot actually is. But the way all these elements ingeniously blend together at the end is the film's main strength. Somehow, Hanson also manages to retain his grasp on the film's trio of complex leads, who are all heavily conflicted and psychologically scarred in some manner. Even Exley, who is a determined straight- arrow, concludes that circumstances often call for one's dark side to be embraced. It's a film noir more invested in the driving force at the core of its central characters than any crime committed, and a crime story more focused on the politicking of the higher-ups and the corruption that comes with it. Despite the occasional wobble, L.A. Confidential is still thrilling cinema 18 years on.",L.A. Confidential
54,poe426,Stylized neo-noir...,8,13 October 2014,"One of the more interesting (if theatrical) westerns to come down the pike over the years was TOMBSTONE: the performances were sometimes over the top and the progression of events pared down to their absolute bare minimums, but it worked. Ditto, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL. Many of the performances are theatrical in the extreme (those of Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and Kim Basinger, in particular), but the film overall is effective. While some of the twists and turns aren't exactly unexpected (especially not for fans of films Noir), as a whole the story succeeds admirably: it's Neo-Vintage Crime Noir at its best. We haven't seen very many of these kind of movies in recent years. More's the pity: we could sure use More Noir.",L.A. Confidential
55,filipemanuelneto,"For me, the best film of 1997 and one of the best at the end of the millennium.",10,18 April 2021,"This film is an excellent cinematic tribute, paying homage, in a way, not only to the golden age of American cinema, but also to cinema noir, with a style that largely resembles the stylized and gloomy look of these films, but devoid of shadows and something dark that characterizes them. The film is now a little forgotten, or at least I haven't seen it so much on TV specialized movie channels... but the fact is that it is a remarkable work of cinema, won two Oscars (Best Actress, for Kim Basinger, and Best Adapted Screenplay) and received nominations for seven more statuettes (Best Film, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Soundtrack). It was, in fact, the great film of 1997, even better than ""Titanic"".The film takes place in the golden years of Hollywood: shortly after the arrest of the biggest mobster in the city, the police seem determined to prevent the formation of new crime syndicates, but gradually the rot and corruption of the police force itself becomes evident. Among them, three policemen stand out, for different reasons: the brutal Bud White, the self-centered Jack Vincennes and the determined and incorruptible Ed Exley. Each of them, alone and in his own way, finds himself investigating the same crime: the death of a policeman in a massacre that took place inside a restaurant, and his eventual relationship with a mobster who runs a deal of luxury call-girls, surgically operated to resemble cinema stars.I loved this movie, in all its engaging ways. The script is extraordinary and develops in a wonderful way, giving each of the characters the time to develop, even some that would otherwise be relegated to an amorphous background. As in a good film noir, women are not as innocent as they appear, and the police are far from being the heroes. There are no one-sided characters, they all have a rich dark core, which the script takes as much advantage as it can.The cast is truly colossal and is full of big names. Kevin Spacey achieves, with this film, one of his best works as an actor, at least for me, and the same can be said of Kim Basinger, in a somber character that reminds us of one of the most wronged and forgotten actresses of the golden age of Hollywood : Veronica Lake. Did the Oscar given to Basinger this year also end up being, indirectly, a posthumous prize for this great actress, whom Hollywood devoured, but never esteemed or honored? In addition to these two actors, the film also features an excellent work by two Australian actors, Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, both at the best level, and a great Danny De Vito, in an amoral and delightfully hypocritical character. James Cromwell was equally excellent in his role.Technically, the film is full of value and quality, starting with grandiose cinematography, which avoids falling into the commonplace of noir films and fills the screen with color and light, capturing the Californian sun and the beauty of the city in its rich colors. The filming locations chosen for the recordings are excellent and their judicious use helped the film to fit the period and the context in an impeccable way. The sets and costumes, as well as the automobiles that were used, help a lot in creating an environment and a clear temporal notion, and are magnificent on the screen. The soundtrack, in charge of Jerry Goldsmith, is impeccable and appears at the right time.",L.A. Confidential
56,TheMovieDiorama,L.A. Confidential is noir crime executed to the highest standard.,9,24 February 2018,"Well, I wasn't expecting that! I went in thinking it would be an overlong stylised drama with one or two scenes of detective work. Quite the reverse actually, it's entirety was an unsolved case. Three separate officers, each with their own motives, investigate separate aspects to a case which eventually interlink with each other. Let me just whip out the old crime checklist: Shootouts? Check. Detective work? Check. Corruption? Check. A plethora of twists and turns? Most definitely. The latter is what truly separates this from other similar crime stories, there are so many twists that are naturally executed. There isn't one moment where I thought ""Oh, that was a coincidence!"". All of these characters are fleshed out, each with a contrasting personality, where any decisions that are made just feel right. A serious straight rookie quickly climbing the ranks utilising his intellect. A tempered brute using his physicality to progress with the case. Then you have the suave experienced officer who uses his connections to get answers. Individually they work excellently, but as a unit? Even better. It plays out brilliantly because of Hanson's direction. Refreshingly switching between these officers and showcasing the 1950's L.A. lifestyle, he managed to create an environment that lives and breathes crime. One of the best casts I've seen from a 90's film. Crowe, Spacey, Cromwell and Pearce (arguably my favourite role of his) all brought grit and emotional captivation to their roles. The script is densely compact with development and taut pacing, although occasionally does dip. I did find Strathairn's character underused and didn't add much to the story. However, the focus is on the case, naturally including character development and thrills to make an outstanding crime thriller. I suspect this will eventually gain the perfect rating.",L.A.

It was based on an old story, but was done differently from all the others. The picture followed 3 policemen as they went about their duties; one by the book, the other 2 somewhat sordidly.

59,SAMTHEBESTEST,A promising crime drama with few shortcomings..,7,11 April 2020,"Short Review :-
Watched LA Confidential (1997)
A promising crime drama that has a few shortcomings. Not a complete thriller nor a complete drama yet grips the scenario with lot of conflicts and then shortfalls to it's own content. Let me see what i liked, Outstanding performances by Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and hot as hell Kim Basinger, the screenplay with a pace, director's conviction to get the story to the end. The things didn't work for me are, The Prostitution angle and the love story made on it, The overall conclusion on corruption and mainly those cops covering up thier troubles for the sake of the image in public. Maybe, this is not something i expected especially towards the end when you just don't get enough thrills and realise all this drama and backdrop hunt was made to destroy a simple Porn-chain. Ain't it just too less for a Film that has been loved by critics and audiences? I could be the only one to dislike the film that much but yes i have my own views. I could be wrong or i could be right, i don't know, i better fall for a film with a better and strong climax that should really inspire Cops and help them to fight against corruption. Overall, LA Confidential is a promising crime drama with some deficiencies in it's content and we have seen so many better and Cult films in this genre.
Rating- 7/10*",L.A. Confidential
60,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Jam-packed with all the best crime drama elements,9,17 April 2008,"""L.A. Confidential"" has it all: rebel cops, corrupt cops, two-faced killers, seductive women, drug-runners, prostitution, murder, set-ups, mystery, gun fights, suspense, brain-teasing twists and turns...the works. If that seems like too much crime drama stereotype for one film, let me assure you that it all works and it works well. That's why ""L.A. Confidential"" is hailed as one of the best films of the 1990s, though it should be seen as the precedent- setter for the crime drama-obsessed decade that followed it.The plot is too intricate to summarize briefly, but after LAPD cops and detectives beat up on several jailed Mexicans because the Mexicans had allegedly been responsible for the beating of two other cops, the bad press for the LAPD sets into motion a sequence of events that become further worsened when a massacre occurs at a coffee shop. Bud White (Crowe), Jack Vicennes (Spacey) and Ed Exley (Pearce) are all very different cops who go about investigating the case differently but end up closer to each other than they realize.""LAC"" can be viewed in two separate halves. The first hour feels like a film in itself and the second hour feels totally different until the ending ties the two together. The feeling you get is the film is long, especially because mystery-wise your brain has been working in overdrive if you like to try and figure things out. It's a wild ride, albeit a very good one.The acting is all phenomenal. Everyone plays terrific characters. The film was just the beginning for Crowe's leading roles, Spacey works his lovably hateable charm and Pearce really adds a different dimension to the cast as highly moral justice-driven cop. Even Kim Basinger as a woman involved with and caught up in this mystery seems to steal every scene that she's in with her beauty and poise.The only thing going against the film is at times it does feel over-the-top with all the plot lines going on, especially at the end, but at that point you're so caught up in the well-developed characters and their subsequent motives, as well as the mystery, that the feeling is easy to block out. Had it not been the first, it may not have been one of the best crime dramas of all time, but it certainly was and it deserves kudos for it.",L.A. Confidential

63,imseeg,"Could have been greater with a more credible, shorter story. Still a great detective, but has got the smell of a copycat of the brilliant ""Chinatown""...",7,20 May 2020,"Definitely worthwhile watching, but it aint a masterpiece. It's decently acted though. It is a dirty cop movie, that could have been greater if only it werent for some pretty lame, unbelievable plot turns.The good: the setting of this movie takes place in the fifties in LA, at the time of the big Hollywood glamour stars. The settings and scenery of the fifties in LA are being portrayed quite beautiful. More good: the actors are good. Simply straight good. And the story is quite suspenseful, fascinating and even thrilling at moments.The bad: it is basically a copycat of the brilliant seventies classic ""Chinatown"" with Jack Nicholson. That classic though is way better than this movie and the cheap smell of a copycat lingers in many scenes. A good copy of another movie is not a bad thing, but the script is lacking credibility in plot turns. And it simply lasts a bit too long. That's killing for a suspenseful movie, when you get bored..., but only at some moments, the majority of the movie is quite entertaining.",L.A. Confidential
64,Vartiainen,Neo-noir perfection,9,10 July 2018,"Los Angeles, 1950s. A big-time crime boss has ended up behind bars and now the criminal underworld is in turmoil, all the players vying for the top spot. Amidst all this we follow three members of the LAPD, as they all try to live their lives, do their jobs and perhaps even get somewhere in life.What I like the most about this film is its complexity and its willingness to push the genre. It's a neo-noir film, emulating the film noir thrillers of the early 20th century. And it works as a very good example of that genre. Everything from plot to characters to locations to atmosphere is at it should be. But then the film keeps adding to the pile. Especially when it comes to the three main characters. Take Russell Crowe's character, Bud, for example. At first he's a brute, nothing more. His police work hasn't bothered with the framework of the law in a long time and for him his job is an excuse to let out the rage bubbling within him. But then we dig deeper and find reasons for that rage, and suddenly it isn't so black-n-white anymore. Oh sure, he's still a brute, but in a way that we can understand, if not condone.This holds true for the other two as well. They all start out rather unlikable and unsympathetic. But the longer we follow them, the more we start to like them. And yet they never let go of those central traits we detested at first. If that's not good writing, I don't know what is.Great movie. Nail-biting and twisting plot with a heavy pulse. Fantastic characters played by A-list stars. Superb technicals helmed by a talented director. What's not to like?",L.A. Confidential
65,jtindahouse,Finally got around to seeing this and I'm glad I did,9,7 June 2021,"I don't quite know how it's taken me this long to see 'L. A. Confidential'. It's an IMDb Top 250 film, starring three of my favourite actors, with a great supporting cast and from one of the best years of film of all time. It wasn't quite the game-changing film I had hoped for, but it was still really good.This is one of those films that I can imagine getting better with each viewing. I feel like you could watch it a dozen times and would still pick up new things every time. The story gets quite complex and can be little overwhelming on first viewing I found. It doesn't take away from the film, but once you had a grip on where everyone is at and what their motives are then I think you could sit back and enjoy the nuances a lot better. You'll never get back the surprise twist this film throws at you though. Very rarely does a character-turn catch me off guard as much as the one in this film did.Great characters combined with a great story. That's a rare and extremely powerful combination for a film right there and 'L. A. Confidential' has it.

66,freemantle_uk,Excellent Period Crime Drama,10,4 January 2010,"If you are a fan of noir style films, or period crime films like the Godfather, then you should like L.A. Confidential. Here is a smart, complex thriller set in 1950s Los Andreas, with compelling characters and fine director. One of the best crime films from the 90s.The focus of the film is one three main characters who are looking at three different cases. There is Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), an ambitious young officer who wants to be a detective, and has a strong moral view on justice. He gets his wise after the Bloody Christmas fiasco, and proves himself a hero cop after investigating a big murder case. But he starts to suspect things are not all right with the result. Ed's rival is Bud White (Russell Crowe), a violence cop who uses his punching and gun to beat confessions or information out of suspects. He ends up investigating two cases, on involving a massive move of heroin in the background of a organised crime leadership void. The other involves high end call girls which look like movie stars. Bud ends up getting involved with one of the call girls, Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger). The third cop is Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a cop who works on the glamorous size of crime. He is a narcotics cop and a technical adviser for a TV show. He works closely with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), the editor of the Hush Hush maginize. They trade information, so that Jack can make good busts, and Sid could have good stories. Jack ends up being transfered to Vice, and ends up investigating the call girls. Pictures of the call girls with Johns are being used to blackmail people like city officials. Jack also ends up working closely with Ed Exley.The script by Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson is excellent. They make a very complex film with strong characters who have different motivations in the backdrop of an interesting setting. They are a lot of links in the film which puts the whole thing together. They are a number of themes throughout the film, organised crime, prostitution, racism, police brutality, tabloid journalism and legal ethics. It gives you a lot to think about.As a director Curtis Hanson's career has been so-so. But L.A. Confidential shows that he has the potential to do great things. He handling of the material is excellent, he is a fan of the original novel, made excellent casting choices, keeps the film well paced and leaves no loose ends. He gets a real feel for the time and balances out both the glamour and the sleaze of the period and the city. Los Andreas itself acts as a fantasising world in itself. I also like the fact he makes out that racism was not just an issue in the Deep South and this was a period just before the Civil Rights movement started. Black people were easy targets and racism still affects America today.There is a great cast. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are all great actors and all performed well. There is a good supporting with Danny DeVito (in his best role), James Cromwell and Ron Rifkin. All were on the top of their game, and must have had faith in the material. Russell Crowe's character was very true to what he is like in real life.It's a shame that Titanic swept the Oscars because L.A. Confidential was a much better film.",L.A. Confidential
67,strong-122-478885,"And The Crap Hits The Fan, Big-Time, In The City Of Angels",4,1 August 2014,"For starters - I'm sorry to say, but I did not immediately fall in love with Kim Basinger (as I know I was expected to) the very second she first stepped into the camera's view.Nor did I ever warm-up to Basinger's whore-with-a-heart-of-gold character as this film's story boldly forged ahead towards its cornball and clichéd ""happy"" ending.The thing with Basinger was that she was 44 years old at the time of this picture and no matter how much the camera (and the make-up artists) tried to hide this fact - Let's face it, Basinger was about 20 years too old for her part as a high-class hooker who didn't (but was supposed to) resemble 1950's movie-actress, Veronica Lake.And then there was Russell Crowe's character, Bud White, the tough-as-nails, no-nonsense cop (with a hair-trigger temper) whose modus operandi was to kick, punch, (and/or) shoot the suspect(s) first, then ask questions later.What really killed me about Bud was how he fancied himself to be a gallant crusader for battered women, yet, when it came right down to it, he was just as prone to punch and slap a woman around, just like any other hot-blooded, hypocritical, all-American male.L.A. Confidential's biggest downfall was apparent in the way that its story clearly lacked an essential, underlying tightness. It continually showed absolutely no restraint, at all, when it came to the unbelievable corruption, brutality (and whatever) that prevailed in L.A.'s police force (in the 1950s) that went all the way up to the District Attorney.With one bare-faced lie being recklessly heaped upon another, L.A. Confidential's story got itself so bogged down with inane double-crosses, forced confessions and treacherous finger-pointing that, before long, it gave me one helluva splitting headache.At 2 hours and 20 minutes this Film Noir ""wannabe"" seriously cried out for some immediate attention in the editing department.",L.A.

68,ianlouisiana,Sometimes betrayal is the only option.,9,1 May 2006,"As a film of an unfilmable novel this is somewhat of an achievement. As a film per se it is very nearly a masterpiece. When I read ""L.A. Confidential"" it was my first venture into Mr James Ellroy's seriously weird world where much of the enjoyment is in the idiosyncratic writing style.I never imagined a movie could be made of the book and,of course,it hasn't been.What we have is the title,some of the characters and a severely pared down plot that bears a resemblance to the novel but fails to capture Mr Ellroy's bizarre voyage to the distant shores of obsessive sexuality.""The book is mine....the movie is theirs"",he said when invited to comment on the screen adaptation. So forget the novel then and watch ""L.A. Confidential"" THE cop movie of the 1990s.Set in the early fifties when cops were tough and the third degree was commonplace it depicts an LAPD that had become judge and jury in its own bailiwick.It's a story of loyalty and betrayal involving cops,reporters,lawyers and crooks.It's a film of extreme violence,much of it played out in the unnaturally bright and sunny L.A. hills. Mr Kevin Spacey has been lauded for his rather flashy role as Sgt Jack Vincennes but for me the performance of the movie is Mr Russell Crowe's as Bud White the not very bright but shrewd thuggish detective. He is easy meat for the manipulative Dudley Smith (Mr James Cromwell) but his Achilles Heel is a sympathy for abused women,and at the same time it is his salvation.Of all the actors in the movie only Mr Crowe looks as if he belongs in his character's clothes.Bud's sports jacket and casual trousers look suits Mr Crowe as to the manner born while the rest of the cast appear too conscious of the fact that they are wearing ""1950s clothes"" rather than simply clothes. There is a lot of good period detail including an appearance by Gerry Mulligan and Chet Baker(the coolest of the cool) lookalikes. Everyone involved is eventually confronted with a dilemma concerning loyalty.How these interlock and how they are resolved is the key to this movie.In the end it all comes down to one question.Is betrayal ever an acceptable option?""L.A. Confidential"" seems to be saying that sometimes its the only option.",L.A. Confidential
69,XweAponX,A Buttkicking Confrontation between Crowe and Pierce,10,29 September 2012,"This film brilliantly captures the atmosphere of the 50's and especially the Los Angeles of that era. The Power Gap created by a jailed Mob Boss ""Mickey Cohen"" causes a series of murders of all of Cohen's Lieutenants, which we get to see as Danny DeVito aka ""Sid Hudgens"" from ""Hush-Hush"" magazine narrates the graphic violence.Russell Crowe is ""Bud"" White, a two-fisted cop who can't stand seeing women abused, due to his witnessing his mother murdered by his father when he was a child. But Bud himself has a streak of Brutality. After dealing with an ex-con, soon to be con who was beating his wife on Christmas Eve, he and his partner Dick Stenzland make a liquor run for the ""office"" booze party - White meets ""Veronica Lake/Lynn Bracken"" with an immediate spark. Out in the parking lot, White sees another young woman with a broken nose in the back seat of a car containing millionaire Pierce Morehouse Patchett (David Strathairn). In the middle of Whites' inquiries, out pops ""Buzz"" Meeks (Darrell Sandeen) who White easily beats the crap out of. Stenzland tells White ""He used to be a Cop""This intro only seems like it bears little relation to the story as it develops, but in fact it is close to the heart of the story: And we see why as we watch it unfold.Ed Exley is the son of an honored LA Detective, who may have risen in the ranks using unethical means, who had been murdered by ""Rollo Tomasi"" - ""The Guy who Gets Away with It."" Ed however, will not take the gratuity offered to him by ""Jack Vincennes"" (Kevin Spacey), as he comes in with a wholly set-up marijuana bust (by Hudgens, for publicity) of two hapless kids. Vincennes is technical adviser to a ""Dragnet"" style TV show ""badge of Honor"" and he lives for doing it.What begins as a seemingly harmless New Year's Eve party ends up with cops beating the crap out of two Hispanic guys in Jail who had shot and killed one cop. They could not wait for the Press to leave the building and the whole thing is splashed all over the papers. Heads have to roll, and the only cops who come forward are Exley, who willingly plays Whistleblower, and Vincennes, who was coerced into testifying, or lose his job on the TV show. The ""rolled head"" ends up being White's partner Dick Stenzland, 1 year from retirement, which infuriates the entire department against Exley. But Exley was promoted to ""Detected Lieutenant"" - Because it was his idea on how to get Vincennes to testify.These two scenes are very important to the continuity of the film. As a chapter in James Ellroy's Quartet of novels about LA, many of the elements were in fact based on real people or events. The beating of the two Hispanic prisoners really happened, and according to a few Hollywood personalities from the past, there really was an agency similar to ""Fleur-De-Lis"" that hired prostitutes that resembles famous Hollywood Starlets. And there actually was a power vacuum left by the imprisonment of real-life gangster Mickey Cohen.Curtis Hanson uses these real elements to tell James Ellroy's tale of corruption in the mid-50's. It is a tapestry of complex, interconnected events which will eventually bring three detectives: Ed Exley, Bud White, and Jack Vincennes to the inescapable conclusion of who really is Rollo Tomasi, and Rollo is closer to them than we could possibly imagine.There is one MacGuffin in this film: The Briefcase with Mickey Cohen's stolen Heroin. In some movies, the crime is solved by ""Following the Money"" - In This case, the crime is solved by Following the Heroin.This film should have won an Oscar for the gritty realism portrayed, and it survives under the scrutiny of multiple viewings.",L.A.

70,MaxBorg89,Essential Film Noir,10,15 January 2006,"L.A. Confidential, one of the best pictures of the '90s (in fact, it could have won the 1997 Best Picture Oscar: it's so much better than Titanic), is the definitive proof that there is no such thing as an ""unfilmable"" book: Curtis Hanson (with the help of co-writer Brian Helgeland) has turned James Ellroy's noir masterpiece (which is 800 pages long) into a 135-minute long modern classic. It's THE noir of the '90s!The story takes place in L.A., early '50s. It's a city where everything looks perfect, where everybody goes to become a movie star. But, as Danny De Vito's opening voice-over informs us, it's not as good as it looks: the ""City of Angels"" is actually run by Al Capone-clones such as Mickey Cohen (Paul Guilfoyle, aka CSI's Brass), and the police... Well, it just so happens a lot of the LAPD is among the mob's unofficial employees. And it's in this kind of environment that we first meet the three key players: Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is an ambitious young man who wants to be as good as his dad and do his job properly, even if that includes turning in his colleagues; Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a disillusioned cop who not only accepts violence as part of the job, but even uses it as often and much as possible in his personal crusade against wife-beating men (as his partner puts it:""You're like Santa Claus with that list, Bud, Except everyone on it's been naughty""); and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is the classic ""Hollywood Cop"", who gets paid by tabloids to bust coke-snorting celebrities. These three men, so different, will have to join forces when they discover their respective cases, which involve corruption, drugs, prostitution and various murders, are all linked to the Nite Owl massacre...The award-winning script's focus is on the differences and similarities that connect the three protagonists and their views on the law. Hanson has completely removed the subplots concerning Vincennes and Exley's love lives (which occupied quite a bit of the book), preferring to show us only the bond between Bud White and Lynn Bracken, a whore but also the one person who truly understands the conflict and hatred that are at the center of the brutal cop's mind and soul. She's an extraordinary person, and she's played by a great actress: Kim Basinger, who was justly given an Oscar for her performance. As for the other actors, L.A. Confidential kick-started Pearce's career, confirmed Spacey's status as Best Actor of the Decade and reminded us that James Cromwell and David Strathairn are two of the best character actors around. But it's Crowe, in his Hollywood debut, who really steals the show. Forget A Beautiful Mind, The Insider, hell, even Gladiator: this is the role that should have obtained the Academy's attention.New to the genre? This movie is a good start, alongside The Untouchables. Already a fan, and excited about Brian De Palma's upcoming adap of Ellroy's The Black Dahlia? Just keep watching L.A. Confidential in the meantime.",L.A. Confidential
71,estebangonzalez10,One of the top 20 films of the 90's,9,13 August 2013,"""Rollo Tamasi is the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It's supposed to be about justice.""L.A. Confidential was a very pleasant surprise. I had been waiting a long time for a crime drama like this one and somehow I had never been able to see this classic film from 1997. They don't make crime dramas like they used to in the 90's anymore. L.A. Confidential belongs in the same rank as Se7en, The Usual Suspects, and Heat in my opinion. Unfortunately, in the last decade this genre has faded away. This is director Curtis Hanson's best film and despite directing many more movies in the last decade they have been decent or misses. None of his films compare to the set and mood he's established here with LA Confidential. The film is full of suspense, thrills, and has several twists along the way. This is just the kind of film I love to see. The performances were also all really strong thanks to a spectacular cast and a fabulous adapted screenplay written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland (42, Man on Fire, Mystic River). The script was adapted from James Ellroy's crime novel and it incorporates several true events from the 1950's crime world in L.A. Fans of film noir and crime thrillers will be in for a treat here because this is a really special movie and it deserves all the awards it has received because this is a very satisfying film. The last hour of this thriller is really intense and will leave you at the edge of your seat. The build up is also very satisfying because the characters and events are all well developed.The film takes place in LA during the early 50's right after the arrest of the well known gangster, Mickey Cohen. The LA police department is as popular as ever thanks to this arrest and a TV drama glorifying them. They are prepared now to face the war over the control of the drug trade that Cohen's arrest has provoked. Among the best men in the department we have the hot headed cop, Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is willing to do what it takes as long as the guilty pay for their crimes. He's extremely sensitive towards abused females and is ready to punish the criminals. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) on the other hand is always looking for fame considering he's a consultant for the cop TV show. Jack has close ties with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) a magazine editor who makes deals with him to cover some high profile arrests after setting up their victims. Then there is the promising young officer Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) who does things by the books and has impressed the DA and high officials for his smarts. Exley is ambitious and is looking for a big arrest in order to climb the ranks. These three men despite being very different from each other will have to join forces if they want to solve the brutal crime that has just taken place near a local cafe. Their main suspect is the millionaire, Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a sort of high profile prostitution net involving Hollywood star look a like hookers. One of these hookers, Lynn Bracken, is played by Kim Bassinger and begins to be romantically involved with Bud. James Cromwell plays a supporting role as one of the Sergeant's in the police department.This film received 9 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director, but only won two (Kim Bassinger for best supporting actress and Hanson for best adapted screenplay). There is something unique about this film despite the fact that the subject matter has been dealt with before a million times (corrupt cops and gangsters) and I think it has to do with the fact that there is no main character here. All three officers have the same amount of screen time and they all kind of play out like anti heroes. They are not your usual heroic cops, instead they are all flawed but easy for the viewer to identify with and root for. I was interested in what was going to happen to each one of the characters in this film. There are good enough twists for the audience to enjoy this film based on the action alone, but the performances from Spacey, Pierce, and Crowe are all so good that they just elevate this film and take it to an entire other level. Basinger is really good here as well, but I don't think she was better than the male actors in this film. L.A. Confidential is one of the best crime dramas I've seen thanks to a great script, some incredible performances, memorable characters, and a lot of thrills. This film is a must see.",L.A. Confidential
72,Fluke_Skywalker,The seedy side has never looked so good,8,26 September 2014,"'L.A. Confidential' has a plot with a lot of moving pieces, and yet not once did I ever find my self confused. It's a fantastic piece of storytelling, and a textbook example for anyone who wishes to see how you weave together a complex plot without losing your audience.This is also just a stunning film to look at, really capturing both the Art Deco glamor and seedy underbelly of Los Angeles in the early 1950s. But what really makes 'L.A. Confidential' tick are its amazing performances. There isn't a single weak link in this chain. It's a striking ensemble.Not merely an imitation or homage to the noir genre, 'L.A. Confidential' is the real thing.",L.A. Confidential

CONFIDENTIAL is an excellent film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat and blow you away. Smith (James Cromwell) kind of gave me the creeps. You'll understand why once you've read the book and seen this movie. In my opinion, the performances were top grade, the direction was superior, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the cast was perfectly chosen. Also, the soundtrack is really good, too. Before I wrap this up, I must warn you that this movie is very violent if you're going to see it, so viewer discretion is strongly advised. Now, in conclusion, if you like Curtis Hanson films or enjoyed James Ellroy's title novel, I highly recommend this movie. It's sure to keep you guessing from start to finish.",L.A. Confidential
75,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Triple homicide at the Nite Owl,10,11 July 2016,"The finest Los Angeles film noir to ever come out of Hollywood, Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential is a serpentine wonder, a two and a half hour parade of hard boiled detectives, sultry dames and shady dealings, all wrapped up in a multiple murder story that kicks everyone's arc into gear, taking you places you didn't think you'd see some of these people go. 'Triple homicide at the nite owl', barks the headline of a gossip rag run by a sleazy Danny Devito, and indeed the crime scene has everyone buzzing, from the shirt tuckers in the highest ranks of the LAPD, to the burly brass knuckle wearers on the brutish task force. Something is amiss with the case, and Sgt. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) is a dogged straight arrow with a nose for corruption. He isn't quite the formidable force needed to barge down certain doors or break certain bones though, and that's where Det. Bud White (Russell Crowe) comes into play. The two are initially at each other's throats following a cleanse of many of the department's corrupt officers, spurred by Exley himself. It soon becomes clear that they have no choice but to work together, in order to smoke out the evil source of the crime, which may be closer to home than anyone thought. Crowe and Pearce were not the stars they are now back then, but came up from the farm league in sensational style, barging onto the Hollywood scene in shotgun toting, sh$&t kicking style. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her poised, complex turn as a call girl who works for a pimp named Pierce Patchett (a glib David Strathairn), an eccentric who pays surgeons to deck his girls out to look like movie starlets. My favourite performance in the film comes from a diabolical James Cromwell as Captain Dudley, a dangerous rogue who you don't want to cross for fear of his unpredictability. Kevin Spacey is all style and self loathing as Jack Vincennes, a media mogul of a cop who advises on TV shows and hogs the press limelight like a boorish politician. The supporting cast is all across the board, including work from Simon Baker, Graham Beckel, Tomas Arana, Ron Rifkin, Brenda Bakke, Jack Conley and an amusing cameo from Paul Guilfoyle as Mickey Cohen. Adapting a novel by the great undisputed king of LA noir, James Ellroy, Hanson weaves a deadly web of sensation, intrigue and steamy goings on that never follows a readily discernible pattern of narrative, and constantly has tricks up it's sleeves. Remember Rollo Tomassi.",L.A. Confidential
76,davispittman,Entertaining mystery film,8,9 April 2018,"L.A. Confidential (1997) is a crime drama/mystery film that has gone down in cinema history as one of the best films ever made. It is a great film, that's for damn sure. They did so many things right with it, from the acting to the clever dialogue. The acting and the cast is probably my favorite thing about this film. Russell Crowe, one of my favorite actors, gives a fine performance here as Sgt. White. His character has depth and is interesting, thanks to the writing and Crowe's skills with acting. Guy Pearce is great here, playing a hated cop, who has just been promoted to lieutenant. I loved how he played his character and the dynamic between him and the other characters. Kim Basinger gives what is probably her best performance. This was Academy Award win for best supporting actress, a win that she so deserved. I can feel her raw emotion in every single moment of her beautiful performance.The writing is great too, I was intrigued by the dialogue, especially when it involved Basinger's character. Very smart and quick, kept things interesting. I hate a film with poorly written dialogue, it's sloppy and you wills surely lose the audiences attention. Thank god this writer knew what he was doing. The editing was done well and I adored the costumes and set designs. I suggest L.A. Confidential as an interesting crime/mystery drama.",L.A. Confidential

78,gcd70,Stylish 50's crime flick does everything right,7,4 July 2008,"Crime ala 50's is stylishly done by scripters, director and production designer alike. The flick looks great! Dante Spinotti's camera captures the action, sets and dapper outfits well.The story is an involving, multi-layered one about an unexplained gangland killing, and two young cops who approach their jobs in very different ways. Scripters Brian Helgeland, Curtis Hanson and James Ellroy (from his novel) show skill in the way they unfold the plot and simultaneously introduce us to the principal characters, explaining their motivations along the way.Hanson brings everything together very effectively, allowing the storyline to do most of the legwork, while using the intelligent players to full effect. He also gives the film a pleasing pace, and a near perfect length. Jerry Goldsmith adds a strong score.An excellent cast put the icing on the cake. It's great to see Aussies Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe carrying a pic like this. Pearce is strong in bringing to the screen Ed Exley, the good cop whose incorruptible stance is much akin to Kevin Costner's ""Eliot Ness"" and Willem Dafoe's ""Special Agent Ward"" from ""Mississippi Burning"". Crowe is perhaps even better as rough house cop Wendell ""Bud"" White, who wholly convinces us he is a dangerous guy with a painful past. For mine, Crowe is the new Mel Gibson. Kevin Spacey is a delight as social climbing old boy Seargeant Jack Vincennes, and it's refreshing to see him in a more friendly role. Notable in support are James Cromwell as hardened Police Captain Dudley Smith and David Strathairn as a suspect entrepreneur. Good turns also from Danny De Vito and Kim Basinger.Saturday, November 8, 1997 - Knox District CentreClass act from director Hanson and a brilliant cast who all gobble each of their scenes with relish. Aussies Pearce and Crowe are both fantastic, and, at the risk of repeating myself, its great to see two lads from down under taking Hollywood by storm. Kevin Spacey is marvellous as the morally dubious Sargeant Jack Vincennes, and James Cromwell is a delight as the wise old captain to whom everybody looks for support. Kim Basinger and Danny De Vito are perfectly cast, while there is support from David Strathairn.Jerry Goldsmith adds a score that solidifies the plot, which was creatively adapted from James Ellroy's novel by Brian Helgeland, director Curtis Hanson and Ellroy himself.A real treat!Saturday, August 22, 1998 - Video",L.A.

79,dworldeater,"Brilliant movie, one of the best crime dramas ever made",10,30 December 2018,"LA Confidential is an outstanding and original film that is well made and performed across the board. This is a very absorbing modern film noir with meticulous attention to detail with corruption running rampant once the many layers are peeled away. In this world, nothing is quite what it seems, especially in 1950's LA. Performances are second to none and Guy Pierce, Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey bring lots of depth and complexity to these roles as these characters are brought to life. The film is beautifully shot and scored with period songs and Jerry Goldsmith's score going back and forth. The storytelling is excellent and is a great adaptation of James Ellroy's novel. LA Confidential holds up well and as far as crime thrillers go, it is one of the best with the right mix of action, suspense and a truly engrossing story with complex characters. A very interesting film and flawless in my opinion.",L.A. Confidential
80,Boyo-2,Great movie,9,31 July 1998,"I love this movie, it was intelligent, beautiful to look at, and had a fantastic screenplay.  I even like the length and the amount of characters and how you had to pay attention, which is not necessary with most movies these days.  My only gripe is the totally over-rated performance of Kim Basinger. Anyone could have played that part.  I always think that in order to win an Oscar there should be at least a moment of something approaching  memorable...where you can see why that person won...not in this case.  She added nothing to this movie; I thought hers was the worse performance in the movie (other than Danny DeVito, who was in another movie entirely).  Why wasn't Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and James Cromwell nominated for Supporting Actor?  Crowe could easily have won - he WAS that guy. Good, solid movie.",L.A. Confidential
81,adamjohns-42575,Confidentially? It's good!,6,19 March 2021,"This is a good film. It's not from a genre that I like most days, as it is a bit tense and violent and upsets my mental state. I also get incredibly frustrated by injustice and have done since my parents believed every word my sister said when we were kids and I was always unjustly blamed and punished for things I didn't do. But Exley's (Guy Pearce) determination to do the right thing makes this easier to watch. His desire to rid the force of corruption is admirable and I can get behind a character like that, so it's also weird that I found myself backing Bud White (Russell Crowe) too. He is not the most upstanding cop, but he does seem to have a desire for justice, if he deals with it in a different way.The story is very good, but I felt it could have been slower a bit and dumbed down for the likes of me that want to understand, in detail, what's going on. I can understand that it was probably already very long already.It's also produced well although the vocal soundtrack, as seems to be the norm these days, was very quiet, which doesn't help when they all whisper so much.All of the actors give a great performance.
My biggest grumble would be James Cromwell's Irish accent. Definitely not the best I'm afraid, maybe he should stick to farming sheep or building Warp Rockets.Not one is want to watch every year, but something to come back to every decade at least.",L.A. Confidential

Maybe it was just my laziness and lack of investigating that made me think it was going to be some boring, people talking movie but I couldn't have been more wrong.Sure it has its talky scenes but these are punctuated throughout by grisly murders, seductions, police raids, and shoot outs, and yet, it doesn't skimp on story, character, cinematography, or humor.",L.A.

84,triple8,got so much right where so many other movies get the same things so wrong....,9,10 March 2007,"SPOILERS:I had to comment on this movie because I just watched ""The Black Dahlia"" recently and the difference between the two films is quite extreme. LA Confidential is a great movie. It's received so much recognition and has so many positive comments I don't even know what to say about it. But everything that's wrong with certain other, similar films, is what's right about this one.The cast is great. The story isn't GOOD, it's fascinating and plays out in a way that's transfixing. I must agree with many that there are few movies of this kind around today and that's a shame. But there's not much negative to say on this one because the film gets just about everything right....and how common is that? I won't single out any one member of the cast but will say that my one complaint is that Kim Bassenger is the only one who won an Acadeny Award for this film. And I am glad she won an academy award because I'm a major Bassenger fan and always felt she was under rated. But there were other films she was better in then this one. And there's so many others in this film who were as good or honestly even better-where were their awards? There are certain films that one watches where it's almost unbelievable that they or the performers, don't receive even more recognition and this is definitely such a film.Basically anyone who likes Film Noir or just a really good film with a sensational cast, intelligent writing and a fascinating plot should check this out. My vote's 9.5 out of 10.",L.A. Confidential

And seeing this movie now with knowledge of the cast's reputation beforehand just makes their performance here seem even nicer, except for Kim Basinger's which felt like just an okay acting. I really like how the story weave in and out through the perspective of the the three main characters alternately. And the eventual tie in to the entire story is very good. The revelation of the true traitor in this movie has now became somewhat a classic for the other cop movies where the true bad guy is already there all the time. the acting overall is a great one. I really like how Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce played their respective usual characters. James Cromwell and Danny DeVito did great also in balancing their performances.",L.A.

86,Movie-ManDan,Neo-Noir At Its Best! My Favourite One.,10,11 June 2015,"This is my favourite neo-noir film. I think this is the best because it has the 1950s look and vibe in which regular noir films actually were. The general look of this film was only rivalled by Titanic in 1997, in which both films were dead-on in capturing the looks of their respective time periods. This was most critics' favourite movie of the year. I understand why.LA Confidential is a confusing movie that takes several watches before fully understanding it. When you finally do get the full understanding, it certainly feels good. It is about three very different cops in the City of Angels (Spacey, Crowe, Pearce) that investigate a brutal massacre at a coffee shop called ""Nite Owl"" as well as a void being let open by now imprisoned mobster Mickey Cohen (Paul Guilfoyle). What they discover are corruption. scandals, lies and betrayals along the way.Kevin Spacey gets top billing which is false advertising since he is more of a minor character. He was the best-known actor at the time while Pearce and Crowe were relatively unknowns. But that's not a big deal. The movie's general plot and subplots are all super complex and are character-driven which is great. Spacey plays Jack Vincennes who loves the spotlight shining on him and wishes for all the publicity he can get. He has ties with Sid Hudgens (DeVito) of Hush Hush magazine which helps both of them get what they want. Jack uncovers some drugs before the killings.Russell Crowe plays Bud White who is merciless and fierce, especially toward violence against women. He discovers a ring of high-level hookers made over to look like movie stars and falls for a Veronica Lake look-alike (Basinger).Guy Pearce plays Ed Exley who is straight-laced and wants to live up to his father's legacy. He tries to be the voice of reason before and after the massacre, as he is careful and smart about how he undertakes everything. Each men have their own separate paths than intertwine and make them better.The story constantly unfolds and swerves in such fascinating and bizarre ways. it is the best feeling in the world when you come to understand each character and each story to a full 100%. The stories and characters in this have rarely been touched in noir or movies in general. Aside from the stories and characters, the look of this movie added onto the script is what makes this my favourite neo-noir movie. The costumes, set pieces, lighting, everything from 1940s and 1950s film noir are captured to the fullest in this. Other neo-noir movies like The Usual Suspects are not as flashy or brilliantly constructed than LA Confidential.4/4",L.A. Confidential
87,Rob_Taylor,A cop drama that doesn't rely on car chases?!?!,8,25 November 2003,"Yep, it's true. LAC is a good old fashioned cop drama/whodunnit with excellent performances from all the cast. It's difficult to imagine how such a great cast was assembled, but I'm glad they managed it. Though Crowe and Pearce were hardly superstars then, this film certainly did their respective careers no end of good.Things which make this a great cop film:1/ Eddie Murphy isn't in it. 2/ There's no stupid ass wisecracks. 3/ The acting is first rate from ALL the cast.4/ The plot is engaging. 5/ It HAS a plot!To say much about the movie would tend to give away too much of the plot, so suffice to say its worth watching if you want your brain cells stimulated a little. One or two plot elements are a bit obvious, but as with any good film, this becomes something you wait for eagerly to confirm your suspicions, not something you just shake your head at sadly.Although there are no car chases, there is a first rate shootout towards the end of the movie which alone is worth watching the movie for. Add in the plot and great cast and you have a fantastic movie, well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 50.",L.A. Confidential
88,Sandcooler,"Murder and intrigue, 50s style",9,15 December 2009,"This is one of those movies that has you hooked from the first minute to the last, there's never a dull moment in sight. The characters all work well together, and the whole friends become enemies and enemies become friends theme the entire movie is based on is extremely well-written. I really liked the many different twists, they were high in number but they never felt forced, and the movie's inner logic was never disturbed by any of them. If anything, each turn in the story makes the plot seem more coherent. The incredible amount of action scenes and general mayhem also makes this whole thing move at a breakneck pace, and the violence is just really overwhelming. Every scene is well-directed, but to me the violent scenes really stand out as being amazingly brutal. This is one of the greatest movies the 90s have to offer.",L.A. Confidential
89,philip_vanderveken,A nineties movie with a modern fifties feeling. Very nice,9,17 October 2004,"L.A. Confidential isn't just the next one in a line of so many Hollywood cop movies. It's so much better than most of them, because this one has a good plot, an interesting structure and really great acting.Thanks to the different twists you never really know the characters. You think you do, but as the movie progresses, the characters just aren't who you thought they were. The ones that you would love to hate seem to be OK in the end and the nice ones end up to be really awful people. All the actors made the characters very believable. I really loved all of them, but if I have to choose one, it will be Danny DeVito. He's absolutely fabulous as the tabloid journalist who would do really everything for an interesting story about one of Hollywood's stars and starlets...The movie has an authentic and unique feeling. I would call this some kind of film noir, in color. However it just isn't exactly that either. In fact it is a movie without any specific style. The decors, the costumes, the cars... everything makes you believe that you are watching a movie that was shot in the fifties and not in the nineties. The only thing convincing you from the opposite is the fact that it was shot in color.I guess you'll have to see it for yourself to know what I mean. I even think you have to see it several times to get the complete feeling and to fully appreciate the movie. Movies like this are classics from the day they were made and will still be classics in 30 to 40 years. I give it a 9/10.",L.A. Confidential
90,krocheav,Come Back Hoppy Seems We Still Need You....,6,3 July 2016,"I'm treading on thin ice here as this movie is a ""Crowd Pleaser"" so most viewers tend to like it. It has all the elements of a commercial hit; Stylish direction and photography, smart story, slick screenplay adaptation, savvy performances, big budget production details, sex, brutality + violence with coarse language laid on - what more could you want?... Well, dare I ask for a little more credibility?. This script is perhaps at times a bit too smart for its own good.Ex Golf Caddie and original story writer James Ellroy often refers to himself as 'the best crime writer of all time' (that's a high calling for a writer to hang on himself!). Ellroy's a heavy drinker, Benzedrex abuser and gun lobbyist (he owns over 30 firearms!) so, his characters use guns more often than not. His writings also owe more than a passing nod to Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and Jack Webb. The screenplay adaption by writer Brian Helgland and director Curtis Hanson hones several layers off Ellroy's original but remains highly complex (Ellroy had mixed feelings about the end result). Tough cop Bud White (an outright thug) played by Crowe - retains some of Ellroy's own personal life characteristics (mother raped and murdered in his youth) so he has a vicious agenda all his own - but when it suits he's a 'nice' guy at heart - well, sometimes... Director Hanson seems to enjoy violence so lays it on thick - that's OK if it's believable - but, here our 'hero's' (etall) are subjected to brutal bashings of the type that you just don't get up and walk away from (let alone able to speak all that well for a day or two) but somehow they manage to front up next day with a little face rouge and not even a slight limp. Some even take several direct point-blank gunshot hits to the body only to re-appear with a few bandages. Ahh Hollywood at it's best. If discretion of speech is more than eloquence - then the on screen language is about as bad as it gets. Most of the above won't bother too many modern movie fans who've become so desensitized not many will make overly intelligent observations of these over-the-top details. The complexities of the story had the potential to be equally as interesting with half the heavy handedness and could've perhaps appealed to a larger cross section of the public.Friends told me they saw this as an 'in-flight' movie back when airlines used to screen special (softer) versions of films - they enjoyed it - but were disappointed when they went to the Cinema for a second look. It's interesting that this movie had enough going for it without all the ultra 'realism'. Italian born Director of photography Dante Spinotti manages to capture all the action without getting in the way of the story. Award winning composer Gerry Golsmith's sultry music score seems to owe quite a bit to Leonard Bernstein's main title for ""On The Waterfront"" - coincidence or design?. As for Kim Basinger's Academy Award winning performance, well... Action and blood 'n gore crime fans will love it - most general viewers may also but, perhaps with more than a little compromise.Not 'fully' sure why the addition of a clip featuring the man in black (William 'Hopalong' Boyd) on his white horse has been inserted into the end credits - symbolic or just a reference to the era...?",L.A.

He exacerbates this resentment by volunteering to testify in the Bloody Christmas case in exchange for a promotion to Detective Lieutenant. This goes against the advice of Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell), who states that a detective should be willing to shoot a guilty man in the back for the greater good. Exley's ambition is fueled by the murder of his father, killed by an unknown assailant, whom Exley nicknames ""Rollo Tomasi"".Officer Wendell ""Bud"" White (Russell Crowe), whom Exley considers a ""mindless thug"", is a plainclothes officer obsessed with violently punishing woman-beaters. One such incident leads him to confront a former cop named Leland ""Buzz"" Meeks, a driver for Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn). White comes to dislike Exley after White's partner, Dick Stensland, is fired due to Exley's testimony in the Bloody Christmas scandal. White is sought out by Smith for a job in which they harass and beat up out-of-town criminals trying to fill the void left in Los Angeles following the imprisonment of gangster Mickey Cohen for tax evasion. The Nite Owl case, a multiple homicide at a coffee shop, becomes personal after Stensland is found to be one of the victims.Detective Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a narcotics detective who moonlights as a technical adviser on Badge of Honor, a popular TV police drama series. He is providing Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), publisher of the Hush-Hush tabloid magazine, with tips about celebrity arrests that will attract more readers to Hudgens' magazine. When he becomes involved in Hudgen's scheme to set up actor Matt Reynolds (Simon Baker) in a homosexual tryst with L.A. district attorney Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), and Reynolds is killed as a result, Vincennes becomes determined to find the killer.",L.A.

93,mjw2305,Top Notch Thriller,9,23 January 2005,"This is one of those films that may pass you by if you chose to watch it when other distractions are around. Along with the Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction, i made several attempts to begin watching this movie, only find myself switching it off after 1/2 an hour or so due to distraction or lack of attention. Don't miss interpret what am i saying, this not a sign of a poor movie, in fact quite the opposite; it is merely a warning that films such as these require our undivided attention, and without it they may seem to be less than they are.L.A. Confidential is a terrific thriller set in the 50's, with very realistic characters and an accurate depiction of the corruption and issues of the period.The cast includes Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Bassinger and Danny Devito, and every one of them delivers a top notch performance, and i have to say Guy Pearce was surprisingly the one that shone the most.Not to be missed 9/10",L.A.

94,DeeNine-2,Classy film noire thriller with atmosphere,8,18 November 1999,"""L.A. Confidential"" is a ""guy thing,"" a well-directed, fast-paced thriller with an atmospheric feel comparable to say ""Chinatown"" and ""Sunset Boulevard."" Director Curtis Hanson brings the fifties L.A. milieu to life with music, authentic appearing sets and a story that focuses on crime and corruption, false glamour and moral disillusionment as only the City of Angels could play it. Things get a little bit comic book toward the end, but the characters and story and the rapid-fire one-liners will keep you glued to the screen. There's a lot of Raymond Chandler's L.A. here.""Confidential"" was the name of an ""exposé"" magazine published in the fifties in the L.A. area. I recall seeing it as a kid in liquor stores at some distance from the comic books. It used green lettering on its first page (the only page I ever saw), and amazing as it may be, I recall a headline once seen: ""Youth Attacks/Rapes Own Mother."" In this film the magazine is called ""Hush- Hush,"" and Danny DeVito is appropriately cast as its sleazy editor and publisher.Kim Basinger appears as a Veronica Lake look-a-like prostitute and plays it like Lauren Becall from a Bogey film, but without any wit or grace. James Cromwell is the personification of evil as the morally sick Capt Dudley Smith. Russell Crowe as Bud White, the justice-dispensing cop with a brutal temper and a soft heart for battered dames, gives an excellent performance. Guy Pearce as Ed Exley, the cop with glasses who doesn't care what the other cops think is also very good. Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes, the cop whose thrill is to be part of the TV production ""Badge of Honor"" (that's the old ""Dragnet"" series with Jack Web from the fifties) is also good.In short, the cast is excellent and is probably the main reason this classy ""shoot 'em up"" is so over-rated. It was number 27 on IMDb's top 250 last time I looked. Recent movies and especially male-ID films tend to be overrated on this site. As the Internet and IMDb acquire a greater feminine voice, the ratings of thriller/action/adventure flicks will tumble.A question to ask while watching this is, was the LAPD really this corrupt? Quick answer: yes. Next question, why? Answer, because all police departments, like all governments eventually become infested with corruption and must to cleaned out or overthrown. Why? Quick, but non- illuminating answer: human nature. Even you and I, if we had to deal with criminals on the one hand and the bureaucracy of the justice system on the other, day after frustrating and cynical day, might very well take on the values and persona of our surroundings.Some authentic period piece phrases heard in the movie: ""Just the facts, Jack""; ""taco bender""; ""just another Hollywood homicide""; ""maybe that's why he's under a house in Elysian Park and don't smell too good"" and of course the sleazy tabloid tag: ""off the record, on the QT and very hush-hush.""One last thought for Director Hanson: Here's a lyric from a fifties tune that should have made the sound track: ""Confidential as a church at twilight/Secret and moving as a lover's prayer/My love for you will always be confidential to me."" They used to moon over that one in the barrios, circa 1955.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

95,sme_no_densetsu,A well-made detective story with a classic feel,8,29 October 2008,"Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"" is set in Los Angeles in the 1950's and centres on a trio of police officers each trying to piece together the events surrounding a massacre in an all night diner. The film gives a modern twist to many elements of the film noir genre.The filmmakers managed to assemble a fine cast which includes Aussies Russell Crowe & Guy Pearce at a time when they were practically unknown to American audiences. Kevin Spacey stands out as the flashy Jack Vincennes, Kim Basinger won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her performance and there are a number of talented character actors in smaller roles. (Personally, I don't think that Basinger deserved to win the Oscar but I may be in the minority there.)The story, adapted from James Ellroy's novel by Hanson & Brian Helgeland, is a satisfying detective yarn that reflects the Hollywood image as it contrasts with Hollywood reality. The screenplay's intricacies invite comparison to ""Chinatown"", so it's no surprise that it landed the film it's second of two Oscars.Curtis Hanson's direction is well-handled throughout as he somehow manages to give the film a 'classic' feel without making it seem like a derivative throwback. The setting may be the key in establishing this timeless look. The soundtrack is also worth mentioning since it includes some well-chosen music that goes a long way in enhancing the vibe. Jerry Goldsmith's score is another important element (coincidentally, it's faintly reminiscent of his work on ""Chinatown"").The film's high ranking (#63 in the IMDb Top 250 as of this writing) is a bit of a surprise but I see no problem with according ""L.A. Confidential"" a status of modern day classic. It's only a short step away from a truly superlative crime drama like ""Chinatown"", which is high praise indeed.",L.A. Confidential
96,Howlin Wolf,Brilliant.,10,1 April 2001,"I'm not going to launch into an in-depth analysis of the film (Lord knows I had to do enough of that to get an A-level in Media) Suffice to say this is one of the best films the 90's has produced; an achievement made all the more remarkable considering the complex source material. I admire Hanson and Helgeland for fashioning a taut and relatively easy to understand thriller without sacrificing too many of the nuances that make Ellroy's books great (Incidentally, if you're into good reading, I recommend ""The Black Dahlia"") I had to watch this film multiple times daily for a year and not once did I get sick of it. That's a high recommendation!Oh, BTW, Helgeland also wrote the screenplay for one of the massively inferior ""Elm Street"" sequels. From little acorns do mighty oak trees grow.",L.A. Confidential
97,blumdeluxe,A solid police/mafia piece,7,7 March 2019,"""L.A. Confidential"" tells the story of the Los Angeles Police Department back in the days, when officers were hugely involved in crime. When a new officer enters the department, some of the long hidden deals come to light and cause big trouble.What you see is what you get in this film. It convinces with a prominent cast, solid filmmaking and a good look, however it is rather a solid police tale than it is a groundbreaking story. In the tradition of well-known mafia movies, it tells the same story from a different perspective. Entertaining but not breathtaking.All in all this is a very solid crime movie, focussing on a corrupt police. The heart of this movie are the actors themselves, otherwise this is a solid Hollywood Blockbuster.",L.A. Confidential
98,Cosmoeticadotcom,Great,9,21 June 2012,"L.A. Confidential is a great film not because it is revolutionary, in terms of style nor approach, but because it is so uniformly excellent in every area. It is one of those films that stands in counterpoint to the director as auteur, although surely a different director would have made a different film. The point is that the material is so good that it's one of those can't miss films. It also exemplifies that the most revolutionary thing in art is greatness, especially sustained greatness. Any work of art, and any artist, has to be judged in this manner, since it is the only objective way to evaluate things. Notions like revolutionary or daring are too subjective. What was revolutionary often becomes clichéd. True originality resists easy mimicry and subsequent triteness.A good example of this comes from two earlier films that this one is most compared to: Roman Polanski's Chinatown (1974), and Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction (1994). While both of these are good films, neither is great. Chinatown is far less complex than L.A. Confidential, and almost wholly dependent upon lead actor Jack Nicholson's abilities. Quick- other than John Huston, name me an actor from that film. See? It's also a far less realistic film, and far more dependent upon style. Even more style-dependent is Pulp Fiction, a film almost devoid of realism. In fact, even though it is based on a novel, whereas Serpico was based upon real life events across the continent, and two decades later, L.A. Confidential is really an extension of that Al Pacino film's exploration of evil. Both show that all the cops are criminals of one sort or another. Only degree of criminality is in question. In both films, the leads win, but pay for victory with extreme loss. This is why Curtis Hanson's film is better than the two films it's most compared to by critics, and holds up well against the more realistic drama of Serpico. It's also why, compared to the violence, especially in Pulp Fiction, that in this film is never gratuitous. It always is at a minimum, within the bounds of character and circumstance, and advances the story, even if just in a small way. Also, the fact that all the cops, even the 'good ones,' are criminals, is something just not seen in most films of the last few decades of Right Wing hagiography of all who wear uniforms.When this film came out, in 1997, it was one of the few films that I ever saw twice in a theater. After having seen it once with a female friend, I recommended it to other friends, and went to see it again with them. In watching it a couple of times over the years, and for review, it is one of those films that has many things in its backgrounds, many moments that become 'Aha' moments upon rewatch, and make the viewer re-evaluate just what the film is doing and why. This is the definition of depth. Yes, the film is not as existential as Ingmar Bergman's Shame, nor is it as innovative as Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, nor does it present reality as closely and achingly as Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story, but its uniform excellence, and ability to do even its genre moments well (I recall pumping my fist and going, 'yeah!"" when Exley shoots Smith in the back at my first viewing), and recast clichés as something different (bright lights noir), are among the many reasons this film rises to greatness. I would not go so far as the hagiographizing Andrew Sarris, in casting all crime films as pre- and post-L.A. Confidential, because the film does as much to celebrate film noir as it does to recast it, but it certainly is one of the best Hollywood films of the last thirty years or so. It is also the high point of director Curtis Hanson's rather pedestrian career, and the only one of his films to ever come near and surpass greatness, another argument that auteurism is not the only way to get a great work of cinema made for, without the contributions of those mentioned, this film would likely still have been a good one, but great? I doubt it. Regardless, L.A. Confidential is a great film, one of the best crime drams ever filmed. See it. Or else.",L.A. Confidential
99,seymourblack-1,Merits Recognition As An All Time Classic,10,1 January 2010,"Curtis Hanson's magnificent evocation of Los Angeles in the early 1950s shows the city being promoted as a glamorous place where life is good and jobs are plentiful, however, the presence of its large scale, high profile organised crime network and a corrupt Police Department do nothing to enhance this well cultivated image. It's against this background that the events depicted in ""L.A.Confidential"" unfold to reveal an engrossing tale of crime, corruption, drugs, blackmail and politics in a way which incorporates humour, numerous twists, memorable characters and plenty of intrigue.The story's main characters are three very different types of police officers. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is ambitious, honest and operates ""by the book"". He isn't prepared to condone any of the corruption and brutality which he sees around him and this trait predictably brings him into conflict with his fellow officers. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a volatile thug who habitually ignores Departmental rules to dispense justice in a way which he regards as being effective. He also detests men who physically abuse women and takes pleasure in beating them up. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is witty, confident and smart and derives great satisfaction from being the technical adviser on a popular TV cop show called ""Badge Of Honor"". He's also on the take from Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) who's the editor of a popular tabloid magazine called ""Hush-Hush"" and in return he sets up celebrity arrests which provide him with good publicity and Hudgens with good material for his ""scandal sheet"".Following the arrest of a local mobster, the power struggle that ensues leads to wide scale violence and a series of well publicised murders and the adverse effect of this is heightened further when photographs of a massive brawl involving LAPD officers beating up a group of Mexicans appears in the newspapers. The need to show publicly that the Police Department is determined to stamp out this type of conduct leads to the dismissal of Bud's partner Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel) after Ed cooperates with the subsequent investigation. The impressive political skills he demonstrates during this process also lead to him being promoted.A short time later, Stensland is one of the victims of a massacre at ""The Night Owl"" coffee shop and Ed, Bud and Jack all gradually become involved in the investigations that follow. Three black suspects are rapidly identified and Ed's interrogation techniques lead to the case being successfully closed. Ed, Bud and Jack share varying degrees of doubt about the case and their further unofficial investigations eventually lead to a massive web of corruption being uncovered in which city officials, a prostitution business, LAPD officers and drug dealing are all involved.Early on in the story, Police Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) tries to discourage Ed from following his ambition to become a detective and rightly identifies him as a political animal. In testing Ed's ambition, Smith asks him if he would be prepared to plant evidence or beat a confession out of a suspect or if necessary shoot one in the back. Ed is appalled by these practices and answers no to all three questions. Significantly, his attitude later changes as circumstances lead him to abandon his principles. Similarly, Bud finds himself in a situation where he does something he despises when he hits a woman and ironically the lives of all three detectives are put in their greatest danger by fellow LAPD officers.The story contains a number of unusual allegiances as exemplified by Jack's extracurricular activities but it's also interesting to see the dynamic which develops when colleagues who hate each other actually decide to collaborate together.The atmosphere of the period and the location in which the action takes place is beautifully recreated by expert use of colour, costumes, music, DeVito's marvellous narration and Dante Spinotti's wonderful cinematography. The story is lengthy and involved but remains totally coherent and riveting throughout. This is attributable in no small measure to the superb quality of the screenplay by Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland and also Hanson's direction which uses some unobtrusive techniques (like displaying the names of certain characters and inserting a miniaturised image of the Rita Hayworth lookalike) in order to avoid any confusion.The quality of the acting is consistently first-rate with Pearce, Crowe and Spacey all providing outstanding performances. DeVito brings great enthusiasm, cynicism and humour to his role and Kim Basinger is convincing as the grounded and vulnerable Lynn Bracken. James Cromwell makes a very strong impact as a cunning and dangerous authority figure and David Strathairn as the story's most enigmatic character (Pierce Patchett), is also excellent.In ""L.A.Confidential"" everyone is flawed, the LAPD don't live up to the image portrayed on ""Badge Of Honor"", the prostitutes who are cut to look like movie stars are involved in a tawdry pretence and the city itself also suffers from the same type of disconnect between image and reality.By contrast, this movie is the real thing, a great achievement and an immense credit to everyone who was involved in its making. It's a work of considerable substance and rare quality and surely merits recognition as an all time classic.",L.A. Confidential

102,baumer,"Hard to follow, Basinger is not worthy of Best S.A, the three male leads are incredible, overall a pretty good film",8,24 August 1999,"People say that this reminds them of Chinatown, I disagree.  I think it reminds me more of Tequila Sunrise.  Both have confusing plots, both are film noir in a way and both are richly acted and very well written.  What I enjoyed most about this was the excellent performances of Spacey, Pearce and Crowe.  All three carried out their roles superbly.  When Crowe( Bud White ) was mad ( which was quite a bit ) you could feel his anger.  It was written all over his face so that when he lashes out you understand why.  Spacey ( Vinsensse ) was a bit of a hotdog in the film but he slowly changes and eventually doesn't like what he sees in the mirror.  He also has one of the key scenes in the film when he discovers the main culprit.  When he utters the name of the man that supposedly killed Pearce's father, that gave me chills.  It was such a well written scene and carried out beautifully by Spacey.  I admired Pearce's character ( Ed Exley ).  He was not so much a political cronie as he did what he felt was right, all the time.  He had integrity and he never wanted to jeapordize that, for any reason.  That is why at the conclusion of the film I was left feeling strange when the denoument carried out the way it did.  Pearce shoots the bad guy as he walking away.  He didn't defend himself in the line of duty, but he killed a man that deserved to die.  This man was a cop killer, a murderer, a rapist and a man who thought he was above the law.  Does that make it right to shoot him?  I'm sure we all think so, but for Pearce to shoot him would have taken alot.  Asking moral questions the way the film did was one of its great strengths.As for the comparison with Titanic.  Titanic was a superb film that did everything right and deserved to win everything that it did.  These are completely different kinds of movies and Titanic got its just rewards. Just because a film moves a little slowly and has film noir written all over it, it does not mean that it is a better movie than a fantasy that touches your heart.  That was also a problem in 81 and 82 when the tables were turned and fantasy ( Raiders of the Lost Ark and ET) lost out to dramatics ( Chariots of Fire and Gandhi.  I am glad that the academy has learned to recognize movies like Titanic.  To me it was worthy of best picture and best director and the musical score in that film should have won as well.  Enough about that.What I can't understand for the life of me is how Basinger won Best Supporting Actress.  She had what, thirty seconds of screen time?  Her character was well played but I have seen her character a hundred times before.  So that irks me, almost as much as the fact that none of the males won an Oscar.  Spacey and Crowe each could have been up for best actor and Pearce could have been up for best actor or best supporting actor.  Hell, Cromwell could have been nominated as well.  All I know is someone should have won an acting award in this film besides Basinger.  That was a mercy award to me.I really did enjoy this film although I think it is over rated quite a bit. It had me interested and intrigued and it left me asking myself questions at the conclusion.  But I just don't think it is as great as everyone says it is.",L.A. Confidential
103,film-critic,Will this review put me on the QT? How about Hush-Hush?,2,8 December 2008,"In 1997, five films were up for the category of best picture  of those ""LA Confidential"" was a contender. It was an up and down year for the Academy, having the highest grossing picture on the ticket doesn't really allow room for small independent features to see the light of day. Thankfully, ""Good Will Hunting"" proved that wrong, and allowed the comedian Robin Williams to receive the credit he deserved. None the less, ""LA Confidential"" was in the gambit that year, boasting hot new talent, an awe-inspiring image of the golden years of Hollywood, and the grittiness that only James Ellroy could imagine. So, with so many high marks  why didn't this film win? To be honest, my friends, this isn't a very good movie. As other reviews have claimed, and I agree, it is a popcorn film. It has gloss, it has catchy music, and it has veneer, but it lacks the soul to be an award winner. ""LA Confidential"" is a motion picture. In the gambit of releases, it requires one viewing to see where both Russell Crowe and Guy Pierce first found their Hollywood USA footing, but outside of that  it only demonstrates one thing  Kim Basinger didn't need to put her best foot forward to win an award.Wow. Isn't that opening paragraph grouchy? My initial feelings for this film were not as negative as I may sound, it does require one viewing, but alas, this was my second time around and frustration has set in due to the missing hours I cannot get back. ""LA Confidential"" is a film that boasts truths (i.e. there was a club that had women cut like movie-stars for men), or the dirty cops, but ultimately lacks that punch to make it feel  well, real. Let me explain. Upon watching this film a second time, one could notice places where the actor's voices were not synchronized to their lips; one would feel as if they were on a soundstage instead of the actual location, and finally, perhaps the largest downfall, the secondary actors not quite fitting their respected roles. I don't mean to tear apart an award winner, the people have spoken and it has already won, but it should go under scrutiny just like anything else Hollywood recycles. ""LA Confidential"" needed to be darker, it needed further development into our main characters, and it needed more blood  more truth, more honest, more detail. Boasting speaking parts of over 80 people is great, but when there wasn't a strong enough story to support them, it just falls apart at the seam.With so much distress, I must admit, there were parts I enjoyed. I loved the costumes, the fantasy of this missing Hollywood. The freedom during the time seemed stronger than ever, and Hanson captured this greatly. The music countered the film greatly, focusing our attention on the time with upbeat songs and jingles. Finally, I did like where Russell Crowe went with his character. His was the only one that I believed, and trusted to portray a cop still fighting the struggle with his past. He was the darkness that we needed for this film; his character alone represented what ""LA Confidential"" should have been. He was worth watching and should have been presented with his first Oscar, but I digress. Alas, this is all I can say  the rest seemed like a downward scramble into the pit of despair.Overall, I wasn't happy with this film. ""LA Confidential"" could have been the small film that knocked Titanic off its shelf, but because it was so glossed over, because it lacked the grittiness, it just felt like a Hollywood-churned product. It duped the audiences. It promised this dark world of corrupt cops and staunch criminals, but did not deliver. I wanted this to be a great noir film, a great feature to the likes of ""The Untouchables"", but this comes nowhere close. Hanson tries to stay mainstream with this film, but could have succeeded by bringing his own image to the table. I cannot stress this enough, this is a Hollywood film. It is everything Hollywood represents from predictable plots, to friends finding roles for other friends (see DeVito and Basinger), and bloodless shootouts. Even with all the production value going into it, we still couldn't get Crowe's voice to match his lips. Pathetic.One viewing  that is all you will need. I promise.Grade: * out of *****",L.A.

Bud white the wife beater beater police officer is the exemplary police officer in the eyes of Dudley the chef in charge. After beating some Mexicans in the station buds partner is suspended because of ed's testimony. And Dudley assigned him for murder cases after telling him he's not suspended. There's a murder case after midnight and ed took the case. 6 people shot in the coffee shop owl night and one of them was stens who's the former partner of dick. And there was a young woman whom dick saw on a patrol with his former partner in a car with a broken nose next to a man in a car backseat and there was a woman in the car who bought some spirits (Kim Basinger). Ed couldn't be the only one in charge smith didn't let that happen both were in charge and the other detectives didn't like it as he's the snitch. And smith had already pinned the shootings on some black youngsters. And cohen the biggest mafia in la was arrested and his men was being killed one be one. Then dick found billy who's with the broken nose woman in the car and she was actually not beaten but had plastic surgery to look like movie stars because billy was the manager of those prostitutes including lyn who was in the liquor shop and in that car too and was also a prostitute. They captured the black guys and ed interrogated them masterfully. They went after an abducted girl after the interrogation and bud shot one of them and made it look like the naked black guy was going to shoot him and ed was furious. But then the black suspects run away from the station and ed found them in the adress of their drug supplier with another officer and the officer was down and ed killed the rest of the black guys. He became the shotgun ed. Sid and jack wanted to make news from a homosexual DA and used a young handsome man for this. He was reluctant but accepted it as he could become a movie star thanks to jack but jack found him his throat slit in the motel that he was supposed to be with the DA. ed and bud was aware of that the night owl culprits wasn't the black guys because the rape survivor Mexican girl told ed she testified accordingly because they wouldn't care about a Mexican girl otherwise. Then bud went to Susie's moms home and she said susie and his boyfriend who turned out to be stens was having an altercation with another man who was in the basement rotten and he turns out to be meeks the guy that bud had beaten in the car of pierce lyn and Susie. And also lyn and bud made love he's obsessed with her. Ed asked jack to work with him on the fleurs of the Lille case and jack asked in return to work with him on the guy that was killed in the motel case. Jack went to the house of smith to ask about sten and buzz meek the ex cop with bad reputation. Smith turned around and shot jack and carried his body to echo park. His last words was tomasi the nickname that ed made up for the man that shot his police father and got away with it. Smith after the jack case asked ed about if he knows about tomasi and ed knew it all it was him. Then smith took bud to sid to question him about jack and he told about lyn making love with ed and pathcett wanted photos of them. Bud got mad and it was all set up by smith because Sid and smith both working for patchett but smith broke the deal and killed Sid too. Then bud went to kill ed just like Dudley smith wanted and after fighting ed said it was Dudley and stens and buzz worked as partners for him in the past. They went to the office of Leow the DA and bud beat him delightfully until he says they killed the boy because he heard too much. Then they went to patchett to see that he was killed with a fake suicide note. Then they secured lyn at the station and bud was ashemed because he beat her. Both lured to a secluded motel by Dudley and several men of him confronted with both and ed was hurt . Everyone was killed and Dudley came up he wounded both but ed killed him the last minute and stopped being the exemplary detective. The problem was that buzz stole a large amount of heroine and had to be killed. Dudley was the one one who wanted to replace cohen. The last cover up was very sad. The police officers wanted to silence ed not to smear their names. But ed warned them this case needs more than one hero. The two deemed as heroes and ed was honored once again. He then went out to see lyn and bud they talked shook hands and both drove away leaving ed behind.,L.A. Confidential
105,mattymatt4ever,"A wonderfully entertaining, old-fashioned noir",9,2 July 2002,"I had to watch this film for my Film Noir class, and I'm glad I did.  I've seen the movie before, but I didn't remember much about it.  And I wasn't really in any attentive mood either.  Well, this time I was in an attentive mood and the plot fascinated me.  It's filled with all sorts of great twists and turns, reminiscent of the old film noirs.  If the movie weren't in color and didn't contain bloody violence or 4-letter words, it would be just like an old noir film.  ""LA Confidential"" pays tribute the great genre, and dazzles us with beautiful set decoration and costumes.  And to top it off, magnificent acting.  I heard about the studios being adamant (and it's mentioned in the ""Trivia"" section too) about casting two Australian actors as leads.  After all, this is an all-American detective story.  But Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce are so convincing and so great that you forget about that.  They hide their Australian accents remarkably, and they play out their roles just as magnificent as any American actor could.  And this is considering, the two actors were relative unknowns at the time.  So it put a smile on my face, knowing that they were still up-and-coming actors (in the states, at least) and hit it big with this one shot at stardom.  Crowe went on to more successful films like ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""The Insider.""  And Pearce went onto more successful films like ""Memento"" and ""Rules of Engagement.""  Kevin Spacey was also a relative unknown at the time--though not as much as Crowe or Pearce--and gives a cool performance as the suave Jack Vincennes.  I wouldn't put this performance up there with ""Swimming with Sharks"" or ""American Beauty,"" but this is also considering he didn't have much screen time.  James Cromwell as perfectly slimy as Captain Dudley Smith.  And Danny DeVito steals a few scenes as Sid Hudgens, the founder of Hush-Hush magazine.  I wouldn't say Kim Basinger deserved an Oscar for her performance as Lynn Bracken, the Veronica Lake look-alike hooker, but she was good.  Ironically, she's the only one in the cast who received an Oscar. She's sexy and convincing, but she doesn't possess the magic of the classic femme fatales. I can go on and on and on about how I love this movie.  This is one of those movies that I love so much that it makes me want to hug the screen.  I'm definitely buying the DVD.  It's a bloody, convoluted detective story, yet at the same time very entertaining and makes me feel good--partially from hearing the beautiful 50's soundtrack.  I can tell Curtis Hanson put his heart and soul into this work.  My score:  9 (out of 10)",L.A. Confidential
106,hnt_dnl,Labyrinthine tale that showcased stars-in-the-making,10,30 March 2008,"1997 was a year of great movies that introduced some major Hollywood newcomers and talent. There was Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (TITANIC), Mark Wahlberg and Julianne Moore (BOOGIE NIGHTS), Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (GOOD WILL HUNTING), and then there's L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, which may perhaps have boasted the best, up and coming talent of all b/c its stars Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce, collectively went on to do much bigger things, although the stars in those other films didn't do too badly either. Spacey had just won Supporting Oscar for THE USUAL SUSPECTS, but he would go on to win the big one (Best Actor for American BEAUTY). Crowe went on to get 3 consecutive Best Actor noms for THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR (won), and A BEAUTIFUL MIND. Pearce went on to star in the highly acclaimed film MEMENTO. Of course the biggest instant winner from L.A. CONFIDENTIAL itself was Kim Basinger, who won Supporting Actress Oscar for her work in this film.L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is an enthralling, elaborate, complex tale about 3 cops in circa 1953 Los Angeles. Jack Vincennes (Spacey), Bud White (Crowe), and Ed Exley (Pearce) are embroiled in 'separate' cases which all somehow tie in together with discoveries of big time collusion and corruption at the end of the rainbow. The 3 cops couldn't be more different from each other. Vincennes is a 'soft' cop who uses it as a cover for his real interest in becoming a big Hollywood star (he is the cop adviser for a 1950s TV show about cops). White is a hardcore, gritty, tough-as-nails 'dirty' cop who is willing to bend the rules to take down criminals. Exley is a clean-cut, idealistic rookie who wants to do everything above board and also despises cops like White, who he sees as inferior to him. And White hates Exley b/c he got his partner Dick Stensland fired from the force for his major part in an altercation with prisoners at the jailhouse early in the film.Early in the film, there is a brutal mass murder at a city diner and one of the victims is Stensland (who we find out later is much dirtier than White ever was). Separately, White and Exley investigate the crime. White's lead is the fact that one of the diner victims was a young girl that he had seen a few nights before when he and Stensland were out on patrol; the girl was in a car with Pierce Patchett (a big Hollywood flesh king played by David Stathairn) and Lynn Bracken (one of Patchett's ladies of the evening played by the aforementioned Basinger, who is incredibly gorgeous and sexy here, but with a real maturity and edge, perhaps b/c she is actually somewhat older in real life than they made her appear in this film). White goes to see Bracken, supposedly just for the case, but there was immediate attraction between the 2 when they first met and it carries over to this second purposeful meeting at her home. The exchange between Crowe and Basinger in this scene is one of the best in the film.Exley works with Vincennes as his partner on the case. Even though they don't particularly like each other, Exley and Vincennes both have similar goals in solving the case: Exley for career advancement and Vincennes for more media attention. Initially, 3 young black men are arrested and pegged for the crime, but the 3 cops all know better than that, and so Exley and White, again separately, investigate further; later Exley convinces Vincennes to help him b/c it may tie in w/ another case that he is working on of a murdered young naive Hollywood wannabe actor that he met through his sleazy newspaper ally Sid Hudgens (played by Danny DeVito in winning, lighthearted performance).Needless to say, the film gains in complexity, drama, and suspense as it moves along and eventually the 2 real main characters (Exley and White) converge to tie everything together and then work together to bring down the real bad guys. The beauty of these characters is in the fact that nothing is cut and dried about them. They both have major flaws in them that prevent them from being complete cops, so they need to learn from each other to become better cops. When they get together, they actually complement each other the way that 2 'partners' should and in the process learn that not all people are what they really seem like on the surface.The irony of the film is that even though the plot is remarkably complex, it is not that hard to follow once everything is tied together. Of course the acting is top-notch. Crowe, Pearce, and Spacey are all terrific and imbibe their characters with energy, depth, and complexity. It's easy to see how all 3 went on to great things. Special mention should also go to the great James Cromwell, who plays the cops' police commander; he always gives a reliable performance and is important to the plot as well.LA CONFIDENTIAL was directed by Curtis Hanson, who did another favorite film of mine BAD INFLUENCE much earlier than this one and you can see from both films that he has an eye for style and glamour which shines through in this film. The film nails down the 50s look, sets, and props, but is so rich in character detail and plot that you look past the surface, so that LA CONFIDENTIAL is not just some period piece film. It is a major Hollywood production done to technical perfection with some serious heart.",L.A. Confidential
107,hall895,A fascinating look at life in the big city,8,19 August 2005,"Give a collection of great actors a great story to work with and you are likely to end up with something rather special. Such is the case with L.A. Confidential. The boldface names jump off the page...Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, James Cromwell and, in his first big-time role, Guy Pearce. And none of these big names are just mailing it in, here to collect a paycheck. They're all on top of their games, undoubtedly helped to no small extent by the wonderfully nuanced and utterly intriguing story.This story takes place in 1950s Los Angeles but this is a side of L.A. most people don't get to see. Behind all the Hollywood glamour L.A. has a seamy side which will be the focus of this tale. At the heart of the movie are three cops who ostensibly are supposed to be working together but who go about the business of dispensing justice in very different ways. Crowe plays aggressive hothead Bud White. Spacey is Jack Vincennes, who takes more pride in his work as an adviser on a popular television cop drama than he does in his actual police work. And Pearce plays Edmund Exley, a young up-and-comer in the department who plays things by the book. As we will soon see Exley is rather unique in an LAPD which believes in doing whatever is necessary to bring the guilty to justice. Even if it means becoming a little guilty themselves.The movie really begins to move forward with a massacre at a coffee shop. It seems a pretty cut and dried case but initial appearances can be deceiving. Soon White, Vincennes and Exley will find themselves caught up in a maze of lies, deception and mystery. It will be a great test for these very different men as it appears they may well need each other's unique talents to solve this puzzle. And quite the elaborate puzzle it is. One important piece is Lynn Bracken, a high class call girl played by Basinger. Tying together many of this complex story's strands is gossip writer Sid Hudgens who is played with appropriate sleaziness by DeVito. And in the background the whole time is the somewhat mysterious Captain Dudley Smith, played by Cromwell. Here is a man who believes in bringing the guilty to justice by any means necessary. That's all well and good if you know who the guilty are but in L.A. Confidential you're never quite sure who to believe. The viewer is guessing right along with the investigators on the screen. And in the end it all comes together and pays off brilliantly.L.A. Confidential is first and foremost a great story, with many fascinating twists and turns along the way. The film also serves as a showcase for some of this generation's finest acting talents. Each of the main characters is wonderfully unique and each of the actors involved does a terrific job in bringing those characters to life. These are complex characters in a complex tale. It's so involved that the acting had to be stellar if this film was going to work and none of the stars disappoint. Terrific storytelling brought to life by a collection of inspired performances makes L.A. Confidential an absolute winner.",L.A. Confidential
108,jhclues,Compelling Drama From Curtis Hanson,10,27 November 2000,"A study of life in Los Angeles and corruption within the Police Force of the City of Angels in the early 1950's, `L.A. Confidential,' directed by Curtis Hanson, is an intense, compelling drama starring Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce.  It's a time of growth in Southern California; freeways are on the drawing board, glitz and glamor abounds in Hollywood, and there's a lot of money to be made, especially for anyone with the right connections.  But there's a dark undercurrent running throughout the city as well.  The criminal element is thriving under the auspices of gangster Mickey Cohen, and it's a time when certain officers of the law tend to mete out their own, personal brand of justice, which doesn't necessarily land them on the right side of the fence, nor of the law.  There's graft within the L.A.P.D., and a prevalent misuse of authority and lack of ethics that begins at the top, filters down and permeates the entire force.  And when Cohen finally goes to jail, a number of his `associates' begin turning up dead, and strange and untoward things begin to happen in and around Hollywood.  Finally, a nocturnal massacre at a place called the `Nite Owl Cafe' kicks off an investigation that ultimately involves two young officers, Bud White (Crowe) and Ed Exley (Pearce), and a veteran of the narcotics squad, Jack Vincennes (Spacey).  And it isn't long before the proverbial can of worms is wrenched open and, needless to say, many lives are soon destined to be changed forever. 	Working from an intelligent and extremely well written script (co-written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by James Ellroy), Hanson delivers this tightly woven, intricate story with a deft hand and an eye for detail that transports the audience to another time and place.  At the heart of the tale are White and Exley, both of whom are passionate about their work and the pursuit of justice, though they differ greatly in their respective methods and basic perceptions of how things should be and why. And it's this contrast in personalities that becomes the impetus for the drama; what makes these guys tick, and which buttons can be pushed (and by whom) to get them going.  It's an examination of the complexities of human nature, and Hanson handles it all with skill and precision. 	If you hadn't noticed Russell Crowe before this film, you will forever after.  His screen presence here is explosive, and he brings an intensity to his character that is almost unsettling.  You can see it in his eyes; the turmoil lying just beneath the surface, ready to erupt at any moment.  You can feel it just watching him.  It's a dynamic, multi-layered performance that is unforgettable.  Guy Pearce turns in a notable performance as well, entirely credible and believable, though he lacks Crowe's charisma and presence.  But, admittedly, the character of Exley doesn't command the sympathy that White's does; White, despite his propensity for violent action, exhibits a vulnerability that is absent in Exley, who comes off as rather cold and inaccessible.  But again, it's the differences between these two that gives the movie it's momentum.  Kevin Spacey also turns in another outstanding performance as the slick, self-assured `celeb' of the force, Jack Vincennes, the cop whose ethics have become self-serving and who's lost sight of why he joined the department in the first place.  Spacey readily conveys the fact that there is more to Vincennes than meets the eye, which we discover as the story unfolds.  And it's when we learn what's hidden beneath the surface that we realize what a terrific job Spacey has done in bringing this character to life.  And, not to be outdone by her co-stars, Kim Basinger (Lynn Bracken) turns in a performance as a Veronica Lake look-alike that won her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. 	With a supporting cast that includes Danny DeVito (Sid), David Strathairn (Pierce Patchett), Ron Rifkin (D.A. Ellis Loew) and Matt McCoy (Brett Chase), `L.A. Confidential' is an entertaining, absorbing drama that will linger in your memory for days after you've seen it.  Filmed on location in and around L.A. and Hollywood, this is a superlative piece of filmmaking that must be seen, especially by anyone who truly loves movies that are made the way movies `ought' to be made; this is one of them.  I rate this one 10/10.",L.A. Confidential
109,PartialMovieViewer,Two Words: Lackluster and Mediocrity,3,17 April 2014,"How does a potentially good movie - jam-packed with excellent talent – manage to stumble into forgettable mediocrity? It seemed the cast was tight and firing on all cylinders, the director was doing his thing superbly, and production (whatever they do) was more than adequate (I guess) – so – what happened? Did it seem like there were some major character-disconnects? It felt that a bit - there were moments in the story when the plot was more like a disorganized smattering of unruly lice than some kind of a storyline. Was it too long? Again – time is relative and – for me – this show was relatively too long. Predictable? Oh please – this was your typical bad cop vs. badder cop vs. baddest cop. I might be too hard on this flick – I don't know. I am probably spoiled by some of the quality TV crime drama (you know – the ones that have good writers and last an hour). LA Confidential was just not a spectacular tale, it was almost boring. Don't get me wrong – this is not a bad movie – it is actually pretty good – it's just not great. To put it another way, L.A. Confidential, is like a Chevy Corvette outfitted with a Vespa engine all flash and no guts. I apologize to those who loved the movie, but I won't lose sleep over it. This story needs to be re-buried in that woman's smelly basement – at least for me.",L.A. Confidential
110,adamscastlevania2,"A good movie, but come on, it's really not THAT good",5,11 December 2014,"(46%) I cannot help but feel that this is more than a touch overrated. And although it is a good movie without much doubt, I just don't understand the buckets of a admiration that so many people have towards it. Yes it's well made and acted, but it's also flat, overly long, and quite a joyless watch too, while the plot is nothing that hasn't been done many times before with its good cop caught between his corrupt allies and superiors. One thing that this does do well is that it feels like an actual portrayal of the darker side of criminal life back then (although when Guy Pearce uses a handlkerchief to open the door to the night owl cafe with its two billion finger prints smothered all over it, I couldn't help but chuckle) even compared to the original movies of that period this has more guts with its swear laden script and more explicitly sleazy elements that wouldn't have ever passed through the censors back in the 40s-early 50's. This overall thanks to its better elements is worth a look, but I don't feel it's the modern classic many claim it to be.",L.A. Confidential
111,Bob-45,Confidentially: Could have been MUCH Better,8,23 July 2000,"Watching L. A. CONFIDENTIAL at home, about a third of the way through the movie, I turned to my sister (a MAJOR Russell Crowe fan) and said, if this movie maintains the quality it has so far, I'll have to eat my words and admit it should have won best picture.  Heck, had it maintained the quality and momentum, it would have been the best picture of the DECADE.  However, the last third of the movie degenerates into succession ofcontrivances and coincidences, and climaxes with one of the silliest shootouts in movie history. However, I'd rather talk about the pluses of this film. This is quite simply the GREATEST recreation of an era I've everseen.  From production design to set decoration to costume design to makeup, this movie is perfect.  It's all topped off like a cherry on top with absolutely beautiful cinematography (some of the best I've ever seen) Those elements alone make TITANIC's seem like cheap artifices by comparison.  I livedthrough those years and this simply WAS the fifties.  My only quibble (and one representative of the entire movie; that is, soft around the edges)is that NOBODY smokes.  Excuse me...this is the fifties, EVERYBODY smoked.  The character Ed Exley isthe best written, most complex character I've ever seen in ANY form of fiction, and Guy Pearce (quite possibly our best living actor) captures every nuance of this complex man.  Russell Crowe is terrific, alternately frightening and lovable).  Kevin Spacey is, well, Kevin Spacey...a sly cross between Humphrey Bogart and Gene Hackman, with charm to burn.  Kim Basinger is radiant; she's never looked more beautiful or desirable.  Sadly, she's underused, and doesn't have enough scenes to create new sides to the cliche ""whore with a heart of gold.""  Late in the film, when she ""seduces"" Guy Pearce, she has all the ""jiggles"" right (NOBODY, not even Liz Taylor or Monroe looked THAT good in those 50s dresses), but isn't allowed the sluttiness to convince us the seduction is genuine (Kim, I know you won the Oscar; but you should really watch Michelle Pfeiffer in WOLF or WHAT LIES BENEATH to see how it's done).  The scene seems weak and hollow and undercuts her otherwise fine performance. The is certainly the BEST ensemble acting of 1997.  The only false note here is Danny DeVito (see, that softness around the edges again) once again playing Louie DePalma, this time moonlighting as the editor/publisher of HUSH HUSH (the thinly disguised CONFIDENTIAL magazine).  What this part needed was the oiliness of Jay Mohr (JERRY MCGUIRE) Terry Kyser (WEEKEND AT BERNIES) or even David Strathairn (who plays Pierce Patchett).  In other words, better olive oil than lard...If you want a better constructed, less convoluted and better paced movie about police corruption, see THE BIG EASY. However, if you want to enjoy a sumptuousness feast of artistry, Kim Basinger's almost majestic beauty, Guy Pearce's and Russell Crowe's incredible performances, see L.A. CONFIDENTIAL. You'll have a REALLY good time.",L.A. Confidential
112,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A hidden gem of a movie filled with fantastic characters and moments.,9,2 May 2019,"There are police dramas, and then there are police dramas set in Los Angeles. Something about this town makes the crimes that much more interesting. Maybe it's the intersection of fame and criminal activity. Perhaps it's that the crimes are so much more grandiose due to the wealth of the area. Whatever the reason, L.A. Confidential (1997) is a fantastic film that manages to show different perspectives of the seedy underbelly of the glamor and glitz that makes the town so successful. If it weren't up against Titanic (1997), it probably would have won a lot more awards than it did.It's almost surprising how many famous actors are in this film. Sure, some of them were unknowns at the time. Even within three years, we'd see Guy Pearce in Memento (2000) and Russell Crowe in Gladiator (2000), both rising into their stardom. This is not to mention the fantastic performances by Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, and Ron Rifkin. I'd be amiss to leave out Kim Basinger's Oscar-winning performance as well. Of course, with so many great actors in this film, it can be a little challenging to determine what storyline to focus on. This is my only qualm.Maybe these stars made the 1950s L.A. drama more entertaining, or perhaps the whole mystery and corruption surrounding the police department were enough to drive this movie forward. The twists were foreshadowed a bit, but were still shocking and made absolute sense. I particularly enjoyed the action sequence at the end. The three police officers involved with this case (Pearce, Crowe, and Spacey) had different perspectives about how to serve the community, and the epic conclusion brought these disparate views together in a satisfying way.A hidden gem of a movie filled with fantastic characters and moments, I give L.A.

It's based on a critical acclaimed novel with the same name, and the story follows a group of LAPD officers in 1953 as they investigate a series of murders with their own brand of justice, also its police corruption and city is a major part of the movie. The film leans heavily into the noir aspect, and stays true to the era with authenticity and a realistic tone.
Curtis Hanson's work shows as the directing and visual storytelling along with the screenplay its simply amazing. The cinematography and producing design too.The ensemble cast has actors like Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger, James Cromwell and Danny DeVito.

It won one for Best Supporting Actress (Basinger) and another for Best Adapted Screenplay. It should have gotten more wins but that's only my opinion, it's simply a fantastic film and among the best crime films I have seen and is up there with Chinatown of best neo-noir films. It does everything right in that genre, and it's re-watchable.

Confidential is straight-up storytelling, well done.It's hard to know where to step in to comment on the flick; there are so many possible ports of entry. Perhaps the best place to start has to do with its vast portrait of corrupt officialdom. So, if you're the kind of person who gets drawn in to crime stories with broad swathes of moral grey, hesitate not: Watch it now.The flick is rewarding simply from its richness. It has so many layers and treatments and telling scenes and exchanges. So if I start expounding on a symbol or metaphor, it's a fart in a flaw.But I want to try, anyway.Here's a little something that I can recommend by way of a recurring symbol that might help anchor you as you start taking in the firehose of imagery:The flick really centers around Ed Exley's character, played by Pierce. He's the guy who's dancing on the fault line between two aspects of law enforcement practicum; a stoic, fact-basis and a romantic, belief-basis. And the writing fixes on a very clever image that you can see as a key to this dance: Exley's eyeglasses. They dance on and off his face, and you can dependably see this as a symbol of his understanding of law enforcement practice; which starts out vacillating, but eventually settles on a clear vision of true law enforcement in a decent republic. This vision ascends, takes hold, and ushers him into the vortex of the film's crisis confrontation.This is the heart of a story in which the images informing your understanding of that heart are as deep as they are broad. That's how great this flick is.Check it out.",L.A. Confidential
116,Angry_Arguer,Crowe's Vigilance,9,19 November 2003,"Spoilers.L.A. Confidential is one of those miraculous movies that remains strong both in the casting, writing, and staging.  Part of it plays on our desire to be voyeurs in the life of celebrities (the title stemming from a tabloid, duh) and the other half tries to translate noir into the color of today. 
It succeeds and, thankfully, doesn't try to create something like Body Double.Noir is one of the most delightful creations in the world of film because is eliminates the old theatrical sense of right/wrong and makes use of moods in ways that stage actors can't.  With noir, the camera becomes an entity unto itself and we are left thinking.  Some noir entries are cheap, mostly Sam Fuller's, but others like this are really, really good.Russell Crowe demonstrates his ability to be a dominant presence actor like Sean Connery and Kevin Costner, that's the easy part.  As time goes by, he elaborates and becomes more detail obsessed with his role.  By the end, he is the only redeeming actor.  Pearce is a prop like Costner, that is all-to-obvious.Overall, L.A.

The story follows three cops with a totally different outlook on life and MO. Very much like real life these cops are not model citizens. Bud White (Russell Crowe) dishes out his own punishment without the need for intervention of the courts. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is not averse to making a bit of profit from newspaper hacks whilst arresting people. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is quite happy to grass on his partners to further his career. The three cops may not be particularly well matched, but they work together to solve the Nite Owl murder and find something altogether more sinister.The acting from the three leads is outstanding and what makes this movie stand out even more is the excellent support from the rest of the cast.

Prior to production, the author went on record as saying that he considered his work to be ""unadaptable"" for the big screen. The film went on to win the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay. The script is whip smart; every major character is completely three dimensional and has a satisfying story arc by the end of the film.The film's plot is far too complex to summarize here, but I will say that it is engrossing from start to finish.

It's a genre piece for sure - Curtis Hanson is not after originality, he uses every trick in the book and fills his film with genre clichés, but he does it so cleverly that those clichés seem fresh and effective like they haven't been in many years, subverting every expectation the seasoned viewer has, while never actually leaving or deconstructing the genre.As for the cast - not one of the three leads are among my favorites, but all of them are at least partly pre-fame here - Kevin Spacey after his first Oscar but before his second, Russell Crowe before Gladiator, Guy Pearce before Memento - and they all do a terrific job, especially Spacey. James Cromwell, one of my favorite character actors, is chillingly good, and Basinger and DeVito deliver too.

120,TheNorthernMonkee,quality detective story in an artificial Hollywood,9,15 March 2005,"SPOILERS Los Angeles, city of angels, city of dreams. Full of the rich, the poor and people who dream of making it big. As true today as it was in the 1950s. Set in the days of a young and glamorous Hollywood, ""LA Confidential"" brilliantly tells the story of three LA Detectives who keep the piece in their own unique ways.Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) has dreams of justice. Unwilling to stretch the rules, he alienates himself constantly. In comparison muscle 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe) and show-business involved Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) are respected officers. After a mass murder kills White's former partner however, these three men will need to team up to clear the deceit and corruption from Hollywood, politics, and even their own force.Led by the always brilliant Spacey, this three pronged acting class is what any film's director would die for. With outstanding performances by Spacey, Pearce and Crowe, ""LA Confidential"" is hardly short of pulling power. The irony perhaps then is that whilst it is led by these three men, it is an amazing turn by Kim Basinger as a celebrity lookalike prostitute, that won the Academy Award.As well as Basinger's superb turn, ""LA Confidential"" also deservedly won the award for Best Adapted Screenplay. Based on the book by James Ellroy, screenwriters Helgeland and Curtis Hanson (also the award nominated director) do a great job converting the book into a Hollywood story.With cinematography beautifully reflecting the world of 1950s Hollywood, ""LA Confidential"" makes you live and breath the dark side of the American dream. Actors forced into negative actions with the slim hope of landing a role, actresses being physically altered and forced into the sex trade, 1950s Hollywood is shown as being corrupt and decaying. At the same time, with limited score and well used sound, this portrayal is aided by being shown as plain and brutal. To live in 1950s Hollywood was not as wonderful as so many imagine.Led by an outstanding cast and some beautiful imagery, ""LA Confidential"" is a brilliant adaptation of a great book. Containing many memorable performances, it springs alive from the start and doesn't stop until it's explosive conclusion. It is amusing that such an ugly place and such ugly people can be made and shown so beautifully.",L.A. Confidential
121,jpschapira,"""...And very hush-hush!""",9,17 September 2007,"Among other things, what most amazes me about ""L.A. Confidential"" is that the film is just as relevant today as it was ten years ago. I don't know if the filmmaker's objective was to make a statement, but the piece, set in the 50's makes one that still bothers people everyday: the lack of justice in this unfair world. It does it with some clichéd moments and with the necessary amount of action; but with an intelligence uncommonly used these days.""You have to think while watching this film"", my friend Matias said to me; angry, stopping me every time I said something. Actually, you don't really have to pay close attention during ""L.A. Confidential"", because it's such a kind film that it expertly explains everything in a couple of crucial moments; but if you choose to follow it step by step, it will be a tough ride for you, viewer.David Fincher's ""Zodiac"" premiered this year and it is, ten years later, a classy version of Curtis Hanson's violent and rough way of presenting his film. Yes, it's not the same story and Fincher's movie is set in San Francisco, but what ""L.A. Confidential"" essentially shares with it is the genre connection (besides the closeness in periods of time). If you watch ""Zodiac"" and afterwards ""L.A. Confidential"", you'll notice the elegance of the first and the less careful conditions of the second; where the streets are predominant and the rules don't matter so much.Only one guy follows them closely. He is Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), an ascending policeman who plays it by the book and would even tolerate the rejection of his colleagues to get where he wants. Bud White (Russel Crowe) is the opposite, with 'brutality' as a second name and a weakness for abused women; and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) stands in the middle, resolving cases but getting paid for it by a reporter (Danny DeVito) who wants to be the first to know every scoop; in a time where fifty dollars meant a lot of money.These three men (with names presented in big letters and that we never forget) are tangled up together in the resolution of a case in which nothing is what it seems. Of course that the men as I sort of stereotypically describe them, are not what they seem either; as almost everything in this Los Angeles where you ""can't live if you're born without wings"". This phrases and other are found in Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland's beautiful screenplay, based on the novel by James Ellroy.I think what makes ""L.A. Confidential"" such an effective movie in the way that you are filled with adrenaline and excitement can be explained in two parts. The first one: the combination between Helgeland, one of the most talented and versatile writers of contemporary cinema; and Hanson, a versatile director who's proved to be committed with every kind of genre. This decade, he's made a real-life tale (""Wonder Boys""), a family story (""In her Shoes""), a music underdog tale with rapper Eminen (""8 Mile"") and a rom-com (""Lucky You""). The first three are very good pieces, the fourth I still have to watch it. This combination of versatility paved a way for something original and fresh.We don't get movies like ""L.A. Confidential"" today. At least not in that genre, with that intelligence and with those performancesThe character actor Kevin Spacey; so convincing, so powerful and relaxed, so intense, so himself. Would you pay attention to his face? Please, it's unique. Guy Pearce, also so full of character and unique as well; and Russell Crowe, I haven't written about him but he's great and I'll write more when I write about ""Gladiator"" someday.There are some more actors that I haven't mentioned, but I believe pleasure in cinema arrives when you watch things you don't previously know or expectTry to make of ""L.A. Confidential"" one of those movies, because it was for me; and it was great.",L.A. Confidential

123,Pedro_H,"Interesting, well made, but wildly overrated.",7,17 February 2004,"In 1950's LA a set of cops - good, bad and everything in-between - solve crime against the background of show biz and political sleaze.One of those movies that you almost  want to throw money against the pay-window to see and yet walk out feeling that you have been short changed. Maybe what people are praising is not the production - but the ideas and background. The age when gossip magazines threw back the covers of Hollywood (for the first time) to reveal actors and players as they really were. Sadly this just a bit of window dressing to tart up a tired old good-cop-bad-cop police drama.Forget the rave reviews: There is nothing new going on in the foreground. Indeed it works it way to a climax so utterly predictable and shop-worn that it is almost unbelievable. After having some originality and vitality it comes down to a climax that would make a B movie western writer blush!Stacey is cool, Crowe is mad as hell (and not going to take it), Pierce is the college boy that does everything by the book. The guilty and the half guilty and the guilty-by-association get mixed up, but what the hell, they only get pushed up against a wall and have dirty tricks played on them. Probably how it was way back then.Bassinger gets an Oscar for doing nothing but looking sexy. I mean what does she do by way of acting? Look like an expensive hooker? Speak like she is jaded and embittered? Sharon Stone was better in Basic Instinct (and others!) and didn't get a mention for that. Even stranger still she seems to be barely in the movie (a glorified extra even?) and had to talked in to taking the role in the first place. Talk about right place and right place!The trouble with the film is that is gets its novel ideas over too quick and all it has left is to try and bring a bit of poetic justice to a scene where poetic justice was probably very much absent.Sorry, this  a bit of a fraud on the audience, it pretends to be different, pretends to be brave, but in truth it doesn't have to courage of its own convictions. Looking at 1950's Hollywood sleaze on its own might have made a good movie, but this is too frightened of leaving the mainstream to be that film.",L.A. Confidential

Bud White, Exley, Jack Vincennes, the tabloid writer, the Veronica Lake hooker and the police chief amongst others are all very interesting and their various plot threads weave together seamlessly and convincingly toward a very satisfying, not to mention searing, climax.

This time I saw the film carefully, and certainly its main actors, Spacey, Crowe and Guy Pearce did an excellent work as policemen and detectives also corrupted or each with his own ambitions. I cannot assert that everything shown there is real, but some facts may have encouraged James Ellroy to write the novel and Curtis Hanson to make such a film. The plot is a bit complicated to be told by me here, but I may assert that it is a very well done film, with all necessary ingredients. However, I must also say that although Kim Basinger acted very well, I did not find her acting worth of an OSCAR as the best supporting actress.",L.A. Confidential

Don't get me wrong, Basinger was fine, but this film was best when she was nowhere to be found.

It's not that I don't respect the film school types, rather if the story is awful or the characters loathsome, I can't overlook that to appreciate the makeup or the musical score, as some reviewers can.However, despite a whole lotta arty, I found L.A. Confidential to be quite accessible, and it was everything I'd hoped to get from ""The Hudsucker Proxy"", but didn't because it was so arty. There's plenty of action and it's intellectual without being in-your-face. And with acting by can't fail actors Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey... wow!! A fascinating story that gives a flavor of the 1950s without becoming an overly ""cheesy tough guy"" film noir.Who should see this film:-- Everyone (but not young kids) who has even a low-leveltolerance for arty.

It's a story of jealousy, power, men in competition and friendship, with a feel for the mysterious, and an interesting angle on ""the right thing to do"". Superb cast of actors. Tension very well built. The story is complex but not over-complicated, and never goes overboard with excess. It's just right, and makes for a very smooth viewing. There's just enough dialog, well written and believable, and then it also delivers the goods in terms of hard-hitting action, but while always keeping the plot in check. Top notch crime from the 90's, possibly a golden age for the genre, and if you're ever going to watch one, start with this one. You can't go wrong. All the ingredients are there.",L.A. Confidential
136,SquigglyCrunch,"A Well Written, Intense Film that Screams 'Forgettable'",8,7 November 2017,"L.A. Confidential follows three cops in L.A. as they attempt to crack a murder case that is more than it seems. The three main characters, excellently played by Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce, are also well written. Yes, their characters are generally built around one major character trait, but they still manage to branch out from just that. The characters all have motivations that are laid out in expository fashion, but said exposition isn't so drawn out that it derails the film's momentum. It's quick, and it works to flesh out the characters. Not only that, but the characters go through arcs. They get over things, move on from ideas they once indulged, act out rashly like people do. They're flawed in more ways that just being dirty cops, and I think that's one of the best selling points about them and the movie as a whole. I'm a sucker for a good crime story, no matter whose side it takes. Here, L.A. Confidential manages to forge a complex, yet largely easy to follow story. Sure, I got confused with some of the names and such, but the dirty cop formula is one that is often easier to follow than police politics. The movie mixes both, and it actually works. The crime itself is engaging to see as the detectives find more clues and discover more along with the audience. It's a lot of fun, and often creates some stellar tension. If I have but one real issue with the movie, it's how forgettable it is. With poster art as bad as it has, it's no wonder I never paid attention to it until I saw the ratings. It's not a movie that would jump to my mind when someone brings up great movies, or even crime movies for that matter. Maybe later into the conversation I'd start raving about how good it was, but it'd take a bit to get there.Overall L.A. Confidential is a really solid crime drama with great characters and writing. Sure it's pretty forgettable, and I probably won't see it again for quite some time, but it's a solid watch for sure, and in the end I'd definitely recommend it.",L.A. Confidential

1: characters and acting. The main characters that you see are so much more than just officers. They all have such unique qualities and it's acted so well by everyone.
2: the plot. About an hour in I wasn't massively feeling it. I had no real idea about where the plot was heading, I felt intrigued about what's going on, but I had no idea beyond that. But it seriously picks up and you start admiring the characters and you start understanding what's going on and where the direction is heading and it's a brilliantly made story.

142,jhaggardjr,One of the best films of the '90s,10,26 January 2001,"""L.A. Confidential"" is a great movie. This complex mystery-thriller set in 1950s Los Angeles has great acting, great directing, great writing, great just about everything. Here is one of those rare films that pulls you into the story and never lets go. I love it when a movie does that. The main storyline of ""L.A. Confidential"" is about a gruesome mass murder in a nearby diner that has connections with the corrupt L.A. police department. One of the men killed in the slaughter was an L.A. cop. The movie follows two different detectives who try to find who committed the crime and who is connected to it. Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce portray the two detectives, both very different from each other. Crowe is Bud White, the really serious tough cop who doesn't mess around; Pearce is Ed Exley, the self-righteous cop who thinks he can rise above the sleaze in the department. Kevin Spacey also stars as another detective who works with a publisher of a sleazy tabloid played by Danny DeVito. James Cromwell is on hand as the detectives' police captain, and Kim Basinger gives an Oscar-winning performance as Lynn Bracken, the Veronica Lake look-alike call girl who becomes attached to the Crowe character. All these actors are superb here. Director Curtis Hanson does an outstanding job with the way he put this movie together. I was able to follow where this movie was going, and the Oscar-winning adapted screenplay (by Hanson and Brian Helgeland based on James Ellroy's novel) is compelling and brilliantly detailed. The sets and production design is another plus. The movie really looks like 1950s L.A. The cinematography, editing, and music score (by the great Jerry Goldsmith) are all first-rate (not to mention some good old classic songs). I loved everything about ""L.A. Confidential"". I think it's one of the top 10 best films of the 1990s.

This is a triumph of taste, intelligence, craftsmanship, writing, direction, music, acting, design, in short, pretty much everything. There is not one bad thing I can say about this film.  Curtis Hanson and co-writer Brian Helgeland deserve a lot of credit for taking a complex novel and making it work on the screen, even though they had to cut a lot of good stuff out.  Hanson also pushes himself in the big leagues with his directing, because he really feels close to the material, whereas in his previous films, you just got the sense of a competent craftsman.  The acting is also sensational, and though I wasn't rooting for her to get the Oscar (I would have voted for Julianne Moore with BOOGIE NIGHTS), Kim Basinger gave an excellent performance, no matter what the negative comments here have said.  The standout, however, is Russell Crowe, who not only is frightening when Bud White blows up, but shows vulnerability without going maudlin.

There are jobs aplenty, and land is cheap. Every working man can have his own house, and inside every house, a happy all-American family. You can have all this, and who knows? You can even be discovered. Become a movie star, or at least be one. Life is good in Los Angeles. It's paradise on earth . . . (laughs) . . . That's what they tell you anyway. That's because they're selling an image . . ."" So speaks Walter Winchell sound-alike Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) while we see sparkling images of LA life (and catch glimpses of movie stars like Marilyn, Frank Sinatra, and Deborah Kerr). Hudgens produces ""HUSH-HUSH"" magazine, a Hollywood scandal tabloid. Behind all of the glamor there is the seamy side of LA, and Hudgens continues his narrative: Mickey Cohen (by the way, a real person) had taken over the Hollywood crime rackets. His associate is Johnny Stompanato, Lana Turner's love interest (also in real life). But Cohen is soon arrested and imprisoned for income tax evasion. The control of the rackets is thus left open, and hit squads are knocking off the top lieutenants. Sarcastically pointed out are the LA police, who are not against planting evidence and grabbing a few bucks and administering beatings (and, as we soon discover, are not averse to using ethnic slurs, such as wop, jig, and spic). The focus of the movie is an exposé of the LAPD, warts and all.The tale – and it is a serpentine one – is about the intertwining paths of three separate police officers who maintain the peace by their own separate actions: Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce), Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), and Wendell ""Bud"" White (Russell Crowe). Exley is squeaky clean, while Vincennes is compromising and likes to keep his hands unsoiled. White uses brutal methods, to say the least. Despite their differing tactics, and the fact that they may clash with each other (and how!), these three are all basically respectable policemen. At an inquest, Detective White is termed a ""thug"" by DA Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), who has his own demons (see what happens to him!). White's partner is Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel), a loose canon if there ever was one. Exley was first in his class (out of 123) and chose the detective bureau against the advice of Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell). Exley also disagrees with the stiff and sordid Smith, who uses extreme methods that are quite frankly illegal. Exley believes in following the code of honor to the letter. Meanwhile narcotics detective Vincennes works on the side as a technical adviser on ""Badge of Honor,"" a TV police show like ""Dragnet."" As a publicity guy he is also involved in publisher Hudgen's scoops, such as setting up celebrities in compromising situations.The three cops are involved with unraveling the pervasive LA corruption like peeling layers on an onion. There are a series of events that initially do not seem to be tied in. But they are all related to the twisted plot. To mention a few incidents: A parole violator beats up his wife on Christmas night, Mexican suspects are arrested and beaten in jail (they had supposedly killed a cop), White meets prostitute Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) at a liquor store, an ex-cop driver by the name of Leland ""Buzz"" Meeks is shaken up by White, a corpse rots in a crawl space under a porch, and homosexual actor Matt Reynolds is found dead with his throat cut. But the main occurrence that sets the ball rolling is the massacre of six people (including two waitresses) at the Nite Owl Café, where a recently dismissed cop (scapegoat?) was also murdered. Now the investigation begins in earnest. Several Negroes are conveniently implicated in the carnage; they have records (they know something about the kidnapping and continuous rape of a Mexican woman). Later Stompanato reveals to White about a missing heroin cache of 25 pounds. Meanwhile slimy rich pimp Pierce Morehouse Patchett (David Strathaim), owner of the ""Fleur-de-Lis"" prostitution ring, has ""cut girls"" (call girls who have plastic surgery to resemble the likenesses of Hollywood actresses, like Veronica Lake and Rita Hayworth). As the film progresses key characters show up dead. Then there is a shocking revelation at the one-hundredth minute mark when even a major lead is murdered (although there are red herrings). Stick with this one until its riveting climax at the Victory Motel! The atmosphere of the movie feels like it is late December 1953 or January 1954: the cars, the clothing, and the hairstyles. The film does not need popular music of the 1950s to generate the feel of the period. Note that except for Kay Starr's ""Wheel of Fortune"" (1952), most of the rather modest soundtrack comes from the 1930s and 1940s. Now one may complain that the unfurling of so many characters causes some confusion. But the story – tense and suspenseful all the way – does unfold quite neatly. And such excellent character development is often not seen enough in motion pictures. The performances of the leads are all at a high level (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and others) although Jack Nicholson did win the Oscar for Best Actor. Although her part was small, Kim Basinger won both the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress. ""L.A. Confidential"" did garner the Oscar for Best Writing and also was nominated for quite a number of other Oscars, including that of Best Picture, Director, and Cinematography. It is indeed refreshing to see a big-budget feature that delivers. Roger Ebert placed this one into his top ten films listing of 1997. Some folks believe that it just might be the best movie of that year! It is certainly one of the best features of the 1990s decade!",L.A. Confidential
146,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Hey, Chinatown (1974) called and it wants its story back  standard crime thriller template but with lots of flair and feeling",8,26 August 2006,"What L.A. Confidential does better than its 1974 predecessor Chinatown is its treatment of characters  they are dynamic, well-acted and dimensional, all fitting the story perfectly and propelling the film with their charismatic presence. There is no longer a sole Jack Nicholson who needs to facilitate the film all by himself, but an all-star ensemble cast of a police force.Three cops from this police force are at focus, the ambitious Exley (Guy Pearce), the sly Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) and the brutal White (Russell Crowe), all working for the internally stormy LAPD. They are investigating a series of murders in the city that all seem to be strangely linked, glossed over and above all merciless. L.A. Confidential is a self-describing title  the affairs that propel the film are all hush-hush and you feel it in a tense, film-noir atmosphere build up to an engrossing crime thriller.The narrative flow is steadily set at a patient and careful pace, enticing the viewer with just a hint of foreshadowing of corruption and murders  it rarely dishes out huge doses of spontaneous violence. When it does feature bloodshed, it is at a time so carefully construed that it becomes effective for the story, like the violent showdown with Exley in the suspects' hideout house. That is another thing L.A Confidential does better than Chinatown, in which it was all mood and no culminations. Here we have well-placed, sweaty action.Atmospheric, suspenseful and often exciting  and while certainly glossy in a Hollywood glamour days style, this particular part never outshines the characters or template plot. Visuals are placed in the backseat to make room for the all-star cast. So, my hat's off to you, Curtis Hanson, for carving out such a balanced and entertaining product. The curse of 1997 ensured that L.A. Confidential never got to take home the big awards. Titanic is this curse, and it completely swallowed all the big titles are the Academy.But I am not so sure I would have awarded L.A. Confidential with Best Picture even if Titanic had been out of the picture, because this merely manages 'very good'.8/10",L.A. Confidential
147,Cinemaniac1984,A brilliantly done detective crime thriller that is still a winner.,10,6 February 2016,"L.A. Confidential is a brilliant detective crime thriller that is solidified by a terrific all star cast, an engaging story, and top notch direction. Director Curtis Hanson has certainly created a winning masterpiece.Based on the neo-noir novel by James Ellroy, L.A. Confidential is set in 1950's Los Angeles and flips the city upside down and exposes the ugly side of Los Angeles with many issues rife such as organised crime, pornography, prostitution, drug trafficking, police corruption, political corruption, and the ugly side of Hollywood. L.A. Confidential centers on three uniquely different but capable police officers. Detective Lieutenant Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is an intelligent and ambitious police officer however his honesty and rigid adherence to policies and regulations see him as a pariah amongst fellow officers. Officer Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a brutal short-tempered thug who dispenses his own brand of justice against women beaters. Detective Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a narcotics detective who moonlights as a technical adviser on the popular TV police drama series Badge of Honor based on Dragnet. He is only interested in maintaining his image on the social scene in Hollywood and boosts his own image by providing Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), publisher of the infamous Hush-Hush magazine, confidential tips about celebrity arrests that will attract more readers to Hush-Hush in exchange for kickbacks. The three police officers are brought together initially following the Bloody Christmas scandal which saw several Hispanic suspects beaten by a number of drunken police officers. Exley testifies against several officers which results in White suspended from duty and several police officers forced to take early retirement including White's partner Dick Stensland (Graham Beckel). While Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) and District Attorney Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin) promote Exley following his testimony, White and many fellow officers have taken a disliking to Exley seeing him as a snitch and a coward. The three police officers are later connected to an investigation of The Nite-Owl massacre which saw a number of coffee shop patrons gunned down including Dick Stensland in what appears to have been a robbery gone wrong. Though the investigation seemed to have been cut and dried by linking the murders to a group of young African-Americans discharging shotguns, all is not what it seems when Exley, White and Vincennes conduct their own investigations which uncover corruption all around them as well as a prostitution ring run by Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn) which has prostitutes altered by plastic surgery to resemble film actresses including Veronica Lake lookalike Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger in an Academy Award winning performance for Best Supporting Actress).Kevin Spacey is faultless as the charismatic Jack Vincennes. Although he received top billing, the spotlight remains focused on Australian actors Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe. Guy Pearce is perfectly cast as the ambitious Ed Exley and Russell Crowe channels his inner angry man as Bud White who although is seen as a brutal thug actually is exposed as someone with a good heart. Kim Basinger has always been a talented and attractive actress and she finally receives the deserved recognition for L.A. Confidential. Danny DeVito rounds out the cast perfectly as Sid Hudgens, the chief publisher of Hush-Hush magazine.Keep an eye out for The Mentalist's Simon Baker (billed as Simon Baker Denny) in a small but pivotal role as actor Matt Reynolds who finds himself in trouble.Director Curtis Hanson and screenwriter Brian Helgeland have done a brilliant job bringing James Ellroy's novel to the big screen. Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent score actually brings us back to 1950's Los Angeles. Art direction is also top notch.Winner of 2 Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Adapted Screenplay, L.A. Confidential would have netted more awards including Best Picture and Best Director had the blockbusting crowd favourite Titanic (1997) not been there. But that's the way it is.One of the few movies that gets better with multiple viewings, L.A. Confidential is a brilliantly done detective crime thriller that is still a winner in the eye of many viewers.10/10.",L.A. Confidential

149,Lebowskidoo,90's Noir Perfection,10,4 August 2019,"I remember going to see this thinking, ""Who the heck are these two no-name actors,"" meaning Pearce and Crowe. Well, after seeing them in this, they were both in everything and on the rise and I am now admitting my lame first impressions.This movie has style to spare, and a great noir tale to spin. One of the best movies of 1997, if not the best, it deserved all the Oscars...imagine if the Titanic had never sank!",L.A. Confidential
150,Bogey Man,Not as masterful as everyone says,8,20 May 2002,"L.A. Confidential is a Hollywood film loaded with super stars and familiar faces. Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger are there among others. The film is directed by Curtis Hanson and written by him and Brian Helgeland, who has directed The Usual Suspects and Apt Pupil. The film has been praised as one of the best movies ever and so on, and I think that as an entertainment film this is perfect, but as little more than entertainment, it is not THAT great.There are many characters here, and finally their relations solve and it unfolds that nothing was/is as it seems. The film is set in L.A. some 50+ years ago, and there are gangsters and tough policemen, prostitution and hunger for money..Sounds like some Scorsese film, but Confidential is not as personal and great as Scorsese's work, but it manages at least to be pretty nostalgic. The acting is, of course, the best available and during the film's long running time (approx. 130mins) I really didn't feel myself tired or bored. The film is extremely stylish and directed with great skill, so there are no technical flaws in the film. The end scene at the motel is very moody and even reminded me of Ringo Lam's Hong Kong classic City on Fire with all its blue colors and holes in the wall. L.A. Confidential looks great and director has done great job.But there is no particular message or themes in the film, and it becomes somewhat empty viewing experience. Of course themes of greed and corruption are present, but the film doesn't concentrate on them too much and thus isn't too rich in content, but probably they didn't want this to be too difficult for the mainstream audiences..L.A. Confidential is easy to take because there isn't huge need for brains and the film seems to be more entertainment than serious and personal cinema. But it is still enough stylish, at times intense and gorgeous looking so it can be recommended, but don't expect this to be too demanding and challenging film. My expectations were little too high after all the praise, but after all, I'm glad I'm still not disappointed. 8/10",L.A. Confidential

The acting is might the strongest in the film. Kim Basinger won a Academy Award but I thought that MANY other stars(Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey...) deserved to get one too. I could only find one weakness: There is might a little to much action, which is not bad(very well-done action scenes) but it overshadow the drama in the film a bit. 8/10",L.A. Confidential

Honest, sexy and action packed, the movie cliché underbelly of Hollywood and a corrupt LAPD is dragged under the porch to tell a story mostly speculated on the demise of Mickey Cohen's heroin racket.

154,Rammstein-2,A grand cop story,8,13 February 2001,"(spoiler alert)""L.A. Confidential"", stylish and sleek, sure is one of the most entertaining films of the '90s. With a great cast, perfected characters, atmospheric setting and a classic cops-against-cops story, it's hard to miss, but this film does more than revive the '50s - it uses the clichés and stereotypes in a very clever way, especially the mysterious blonde bomb-shell Lynn (Basinger), who is in every way the very embodiment of the classic gangster story lady. Almost film noir, the movie centers around the theme of corruption, and gives a very dark and pessimistic view of the world and of the police force: even the do-right, straight-forward Ed Exley becomes hardened by the impossibility of doing everything by the book in the face of a corrupted police force.The dialogue is excellent, ranging from the most habitual conversations to the stylish, Dick Tracy-like dialogue between Bud White and Lynn Bracken when they first meet. The audience is constantly dodged between comic book adventure and reality, which is a very exciting experience. The film ends in the typical gunfight, bringing to life yet another cliché with great verve.I'm trying to think of the bad things about this film, but there just doesn't seem to be any.

159,jayjaycee,Glamorous neo-noir with phenomenal characters and an outstandingly eclectic screenplay,9,9 December 2020,"""L.A. Confidential"" is a 1997 crime drama directed by Curtis Hanson starring Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce.
⚪
All in all, Curtis Hanson's adaptation of the classic James Ellroy novel is a masterfully constructed police story that successfully resurrects the well-known elements of the fifties' film noir and displays them in all their glamour, and thanks to a intelligently twisted and anything but generic screenplay, superbly performing actors and an indescribably authentic and atmospheric design, it becomes a wonderfully intriguing and stylish homage to the classic crime films that, at the same time, manages to becomes something of its own, nevertheless.
⚪
This time I revisited yet another one of those titles that defined my winter season three years ago, and as if it were just yesterday, I remember what a brilliant experience it was to witness Curtis Hanson's ingenious work. It is one of those films that are almost flawless and feel like they are extremely short, despite having a runtime of almost two and a half hours. How am I not supposed to be extremely consumed by this feature? I mean, just look at the screenplay! What you see in this film is film noir in its finest and most beloved form, and still there is more to it than the nostalgia factor. The way it depicts the investigations is utterly brilliant, because even if it seems like it is incoherent in the beginning, a single effective reveal all suddenly connects everything that previously appeared to be disjointed. However, before I talk about the final, I want to praise the excellently conceptualised main characters and the actors portraying them. Basically, all of them are capable police officers that are good at their jobs, but its their respective understanding of justice and their strategies that define how all the events take place. Crowe plays Bud White, a hot-heated and unconventionally aggressive brute with a passionate hatred for wife-batterers but with his heart in the right place, Pearce portrays Edmund Exley, a hardworking and extremely moral overachiever who would stop at nothing to get to the top and hence is heavily disliked by his colleagues, and at last we have the disgraced Kevin Spacey (I object his person in real life, this is only about his work as an actor) as the sleazy Jack Vincennes who, next to his job as a policeman, collaborates with the local tabloid press by staging scandals and also functions as an advisory in a TV show. Together, the three try to uncover a mystery, and as you can guess, clash with each other thanks to their distinct natures. A pivotal element of this case is the seductive Lynn Bracken, a high-class prostitute and femme fatal, that looks like Hollywood actress Veronica Lake. As wonderful as she looks and as decently as Kim Basinger portrays her, I think it was anything but an Oscar worthy performance she delivered here. Yes, she looks like the actress and yes, she delivers decent acting, but considering that Minnie Driver, Julianne Moore and Gloria Stuart were nominated for ""Good Will Hunting"", ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Titanic"", respectively, it was nothing but a shame, in my opinion, since all the other nominees in fact displayed memorable and outstanding acting. Well, aside from her, the three leading men at least deliver great performances as well. The future ""Gladiator"" star Crowe conveys the ambiguity of his versatile character magnificently, and also Pearce, who would go on to play the protagonist in Christopher Nolan's masterpiece ""Memento"", as well as Spacey deliver powerful performances in their respective roles. I never really understood why the latter received top billing despite being a more important side-character, but fact is, the disharmony between the three totally different characters is what defines this fine film. Through their eyes, we get an insight into the glamorously shady world of Hollywood in the fifties that is defined by depravity and corruption. It is authentic and atmospheric as hell, and it nothing short of intriguing to follow the characters break a case that is more than originally assumed. As mentioned above, for most of the time it seems like that they only do regular police work with no real highlights, cause honestly, there are none and it is almost too simple to be exciting, but it is the unexpected ending that changes it all retrospectively. All the murders, robberies and rape cases that seemed to have been closed, end up being all connected, and even if it is at times a little too confusing (well, at least in my opinion), it makes a lot of sense and is as shocking as it is brilliant. As it turns out, Captain Dudley Smith staged most of the incidents and cleverly twisted the facts for his benefit and wanted to overtake the drug market of the city himself. However, his colleagues get behind his dark deeds, but even though they had the chance to back off and live a easy life, they didn't, so what made them re-open and pursue the case, nevertheless? One word: justice. Even though they define the word entirely differently and had dissimilar incentives, White, Exley and Vincennes wanted to get justice, and I think this is just brilliant. The three detectives who you thought would never work together, overcome intrigues and all the games that have been played with them, and team up for a greater cause. However, as glorious as it sounds, the ending is not all as just as it was planned, cause even if the protagonists have known about Smith's evil side, the press as well as the executive floor don't want to stain the precinct's status, for it would be the ending of it. Eventually, he is still remembered as a hero, but Exley as well. White is left out, but for a good reason, Vincennes has, by the way, been killed earlier on. Achieving justice has its price, and even if Hollywood always conveys this picture, it isn't always gold and glory, and this is what the film excellently manages to depict. In the end, this neo noir is a fine piece of crime story that pays tribute to the era is set in, but also manages to be something of its own. Stylish, elegant, atmospheric and twisted as hell, it deservedly is considered to be one of the greatest films of its sub-genre, and I just love everything about it.",L.A. Confidential
160,jcbutthead86,One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. A Classic Crime Drama/Film-Noir/Thriller/Mystery.,10,14 April 2013,"L.A Confidential is one of the best films ever made that mixes great direction,wonderful characters and a excellent screenplay. It's not only one of the best films of the 90s,but of all-time,a classic of Film-Noir and Crime Drama and one of my favorite movies.Based on James Ellroy's novel and set in Los Angeles,California in the early 1950s,L.A Confidential tells the story of three L.A.P.D cops Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey),Wendell ""Bud"" White(Russell Crowe)and Edmund J. Exley(Guy Pierce)who are all different kinds of police officers and had nothing in common. Jack does it for the fame,Bud does it for fear and brutality and Edmund does it to rise above the ranks and live up to his legendary Father who was also a cop. But when one of their own is murdered in a coffee shop robbery,the three cops must come together and solve the case that's filled with twists and turns.L.A Confidential is a brilliant,classic film that was kind of overlooked and underrated in 1997. Despite doing well at the box-office,receiving critical acclaim and being nominated for 8 Oscars and winning two L.A Confidential was overshadowed by James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic. But thankfully L.A Confidential's reputation has grown and the film has become a classic and rightfully so because this film is one of those movies is that if you watch it on television or DVD you never turn it off and you are glued to the screen. One of the many reasons L.A Confidential is a great film is because of the way the film shows Los Angeles in the early 1950s,because when people think of L.A in the 50s they think movie stars,palm trees,beaches and sunny skies. But L.A.C gives viewers a dark world filled with intrigue and Mystery where L.A is surrounded by a dark and bleak underbelly of violence,sex,drugs and police corruption,selling a false and fake image of L.A as a beautiful paradise,but the L.A in this film is far from a paradise showing 1950s Los Angeles and how it really was the way people in L.A knew about but people outside of L.A didn't really know of. L.A.C is a Film-Noir in the truest since with the characters actions that are harsh and sometimes brutal where the characters defined by their actions just as much as their words and every character is not black and white but in shades of gray a Film-Noir in where nothing is what it seems and no one is who they say they are and there is plenty of twists and turns on every corner. And while L.A.C is in the great style and genre of Film-Noir it is not film in the classic style of Film-Noir:black and white photography,dark shadows and harsh and surreal lighting,but natural lighting. Dante Spinotti's beautiful photography and lighting is more natural and realistic where the sunlight is shown in the way it is in the real world and not in the movies. While the film is 2 1/2 hours the movie moves at such fast pace you feel like you the movie is 90 minutes instead of 137 minutes. There are many characters in the film but everyone gets enough screen time and no role,character or dialog is wasted. The screenplay by Curtis Hansen and Brian Helgeland is just excellent and memorable,with Hansen and Helgeland taking James Ellroy's gritty and tough dialog,the characters from the book and makes situations and moments feel real and just come to life. And while the film doesn't necessary follow the storyline exactly like the book,the spirit of Ellroy's style and writing is still felt throughout the film. The movie's three main characters Jack,Bud and Ed are great characters who fit in the style of Film-Noir and are really well-developed because in the beginning of the film you do not always like them or the things that they do but as the film goes along you begin like them and relate to the three characters in different ways and discover their complex personalities and who they are Although L.A.C isn't an Action film there are a few great Action scenes in the film that are filled with great suspense and surprises during the Action scenes. The final 15-20 minutes of the film is Crime Drama and Film-Noir at it's best and will have you glued to the screen with it's Action and great suspense. A great ending.The whole cast is brilliant in their roles. Kevin Spacey is excellent as Sgt. Jack Vincennes,with Spacey bringing a calm and cool feeling to the performance. Russell Crowe is brilliant and at his best as Wendell Bud White,with Russell bringing anger and intensity to the role. Guy Pearce is fantastic as Ed Exley,with Pearce conveying intelligence and cleverness with the performance. Great character actor James Cromwell is terrific and memorable as cop Dudley Smith. Kim Basinger is wonderful and beautiful as Lynn Bracken,a hooker with a heart of gold and Bud's love interest. Danny DeVito is great as slimy tabloid reporter Sid Hudgens. The Underrated David Strathaim is fabulous and smooth as Pierce Moorehouse Patchett,Lynn's pimp. Ron Rifkin(D.A Ellis Loew),Simon Baker(Matt Reynolds),Graham Beckel(Dick Stensland)and Plalo Seganti(Johnny Stompanato)give fine performances as well.The direction by Curtis Hanson is excellent,with Hanson always moving the camera and keeping the film moving at a tight pace with a great visual style while also doing well with the Action scenes. Great direction by Hanson.The score by Jerry Goldsmith is intense,brooding,excellent and fits in with film's Film-Noir tone. I also loved Goldsmith's homage to his classic score from Chinatown in one of the scenes. Great score from Goldsmith. The film also has great songs on the soundtrack from Dean Martin(The Christmas Blues,Powder Your Face with Sunshine),Kay Starr(Wheel Of Fortune),Jonny Mercer(Hit The Road To Dreamland)and more.In final word,if you love Crime Dramas,Film-Noir,Mystery,James Ellroy or films in general I highly suggest you see L.A Confidential,an absolute classic of cinema that you can watch again and again and never get tired of. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",L.A. Confidential

The three protagonists have different personalities and are very delicately shaped. A publicity facade, a police publicity representative, a courageous person, a force representative, a thoughtful smart person, a wisdom representative, all three are ordinary colleagues to each other because one There is a simple intersection of cases, no one influences who's thinking, and they are all independent individuals.

Confidential delivers a knockout. Though the first time you watch L.A. Confidential you feel the intensity and high drama to find surprise after surprise in the complex and hidden plot. Then after many viewings and you already know how the story unfolds you still enjoy the great acting and admire James Ellroy for having such a fine script. So well written and directed you find yourself glued from start to finish you can't take your eyes off of it. Corruption runs amok in the L.A. police department only to be exposed by a eager young cop Ed Exley (Guy Pearce). Bud White (Russell Crowe) breaks away from the corruption to help Exley after he learns the third cop in the trio and sidekick Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is killed by the corrupt force. I must say Kevin Spacey is one of the best actors in Hollywood today I love watching any movie he plays in. The best supporting element of this entire film is Kim Basinger as Hollywood glamour call girl (Lynn Bracken). She did indeed deserve her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Kim gave a performance that just brightens up the film her beauty is touching. That's the best Kim has ever looked everything from her bold blond hair and body you just name it. L.A. Confidential gives a message to me that we should all search and try to experience some purity from time to time. With corruption as found in this film and many other places hope for more honesty and truth can be experienced more. I like the way Pearce, Basinger, and Crowe beat corruption. Now that's some purity. L.A. Confidential is a great movie due to the script, cast, and message it presents, the best of 1997.",L.A. Confidential
163,Silverzero,"Off the record, on the QT, and very. Hush hush.",10,15 March 2003,"That sums up the epitome of L.A. Confidential. It presents to us the sordid realism of the early 50's, in the way we haven't seen it. Most of us are used to the sugary `Gene Kelly/ Rock Hudson' sunshine utopia that was, in the MGM `Golden Age'. L.A. Confidential shows us the gritty, seedy underworld of this period. And a brilliant job it does aswell. This deft, elegant portrait succeeds on every level. The stars are well suited to their roles and present their own unique styles. Guy Pearce is brilliant as the smart, thinking detective while Russell Crowe delivers equal oomph as the polar opposite to this; the tough no nonsense brood. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her performance and rightfully so. She not only resembles but also mimics the `50's slut' to great effect. The only person who didn't stand out was Kevin Spacey. He didn't do much with his role, was highly unmemorable and gave a very vague performance. He's more of a decoration than the main star. Danny Devito is short and annoying in the usual `seedy journalist' style, but still very convincing. The opening documented narrative sequence establishes the film's unique style and slick dissection of life. The film's direction is never less than superb. The editing, settings and cinematography are top notch. Add on to this a great script and you have a classic. Perhaps it is a bit overrated, but it is also undeniably compelling. Overall, `L.A.

The story it tells of corruption, murder, and LA's seedy underbelly contains more twists, turns, and revelations than any other cop movie in recent memory. This is one of those films where for every answer there's another question, and every time a break is made, it only reveals another layer of mystery. Fortunately, it's still fairly easy to follow, thanks to screenwriter Brian Helgeland's decision to cut out large sections of the novel, leaving only material that directly relate to the three main characters.This is also a wise choice because as important and well done as the story is, it's the characters that really drive LA Confidential. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a hardworking, foul tempered patrol cop whose greatest pleasure in life is tearing into wife beaters. His physique, temperament, and recent involvement in the Bloody Christmas brutality scandal make him the department's go to guy for quietly roughing up suspects. He doesn't give a damn about things like rules and proper procedure, and after the murder of his partner, he's out for blood.His opposite in nearly every respect, Edward Exley (Guy Pearce) is young, ambitious, and a master of department politics. He's one of the brightest men on the force, but he's also a stickler for the rules, and something of a self righteous prick, whose fixation on advancing his own career and willingness to testify against his fellow officers does little to endear him to old hands like White.Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is very much the public face of the LAPD. As the golden boy of the narcotics department, technical adviser to the hit TV series Badge of Honor, and number one inside source for Hush-Hush magazine, he relishes the fame and attention his job brings him. Now, stuck on the vice beat after being caught up in the Bloody Christmas scandal, he's desperate to make the big break that will get him back in the spotlight. The three don't have much in common, and don't particularly like each other, but as their cases begin to intertwine into something much larger, they form an unlikely alliance.LA Confidential is unique among cop movies for how far it delves into each character's personality and motivations. From the beginning, we learn what makes these three tick. The film explores in great depth their differing philosophies of law enforcement, their relations with their fellow officers, their reasons for becoming cops in the first place, and their growing dissatisfaction and disillusionment with their jobs. It also probes just what it means to be a good cop. Is it the number of arrests an officer makes and the prestige that he brings to the department that makes him a good officer? His dedication to his duty and unwavering resolve not to compromise himself? Or is it his willingness to do whatever it takes to see justice done? I also admired the attention paid to the dichotomy between the contemporary image of Los Angeles and the reality that lay beneath it. Nowhere is this better captured than in the opining narration by Danny DeVito, which starts out like one of those sappy promotional real estate videos from the fifties, then effortlessly pivots into a delicious take on muckraking tabloid journalism. Come to think of it, that's a pretty good description of DeVito's character, Hush Hush Magazine publisher Sid Hudgens. Cynical, amoral, and with an uncanny ability to sense a juicy story from a mile away, he has contacts throughout the department, and isn't above manufacturing a scandal when none presents itself. He's as sleazy as they come, and right from the start I couldn't help liking him.The period touches were also done well, capturing the look and feel of 1950's Los Angeles and adding an occasionally humorous subtext without becoming distracting or overpowering. And of course there's a good deal of violence, all done with a gritty realism that evokes the noirs of old. Another parallel to classic noir is the film's moral ambiguity. Both Bud White and Jack Vincennes engage in behavior that is clearly illegal, but neither man is portrayed as dirty or corrupt for doing so. The movie's female lead (Kim Basinger) is a prostitute, yet she is perhaps the person viewers will feel the most sympathy for. And at the end, one of the main players makes a decision that is entirely contrary to the ideals he held at the beginning of the film, but which based on the results is undoubtedly the right thing to do.LA Confidential is not a film that places its narrative in a simple frame of black and white. Nor is it a mindless celebration of blazing guns and blaring sirens. Rather it's a movie that embraces depth, complexity, and character development without slowing or losing its focus. It's hard hitting, exciting, often cerebral, and very dark. I feel justified in saying that LA Confidential is to the cop movie what Chinatown is to the private eye film; an homage to the genre, and a truly great movie.",L.A. Confidential

Next is Officer Wendell 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe in his first US film), a troubled man with a vendetta against wife-beaters due to a traumatizing event from his past where his mother was beaten to death by White's drunken father. Lastly is the young and ambitious Detective Lieutenant Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce also in his US debut), a young man following in the footsteps of his late father whose dedication to justice clouds his vision to what is about to unravel.

The benefit is being able to watch a film (a) without comparing it to the book, thus risking being disappointed & (b) not knowing how it ends, so I've no comment on the adaptation.As for the film, yes it was fairly good, but no classic & certainly overated. I've seen very little film noir but what I have are predominately modern day attempts (Man Who Wasn't There) and I've yet to really enjoy one, as the cinematography & mood often seem more important than a plot, and that happened here to a degree.The story was really hard work to follow. Not through being complicated but that you had to focus on every word & if you missed a single second you were lost. I don't mind corruption in police storylines even though it's been flogged about for years now, but I've seen it done better & more interestingly than here.There were plusses though. Great acting from Crowe & DeVito with Spacey & Pearce in good performances. But the less said about Basinger the better. I'm staggered she won an oscar. She wasn't in it a great deal, had very few lines and when you did see her she was shagging or being slapped. You can fast forward her scenes.Once the film gets going it's one of the most realistic portrayals of a decade from a Hollywood movie, ever. There's also a few thought provoking social issues thrown up, one or two excellently done, violent scenes, a great intro and some good all round action but sadly interspersed with a handful of meaningless & dull scenes that make the plot a bit stop-start.I just couldn't ever fully connect with any of the characters to love this film, which I never seem to be able to do with the darkness of Film Noir.A low 7/10",L.A.

Man, am I glad that I finally got to see it!With the current Hollywood climate, where special effects seem to be far more important than story line or dialogues, it's refreshing to finally see a movie that actually has a deep and sensible story, as well as believable characters and good acting.Sure, the three main characters (Spacey, Pierce and Crowe) are sort of stereotypical and don't really show that much character development, but they at least feel like real persons with real shortcomings. Acting is superb all over (with even Danny DeVito in a serious role), with the possible exception of Kim Basinger. Yes, I know she got an Oscar for it, but all she has to do is look pretty and that's about it. The real winner here is the story, though. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is pretty complex without ever becoming overwhelming. Most importantly, it all makes sense and doesn't contain any huge plot holes I could find.

176,antagonist117,"One of the best films of the 90s, a shining noir with spot-on casting",9,21 August 2013,"""L.A. Confidential"" is so glossy it gleams. Director Curtis Hanson knows how to shoot the stuff that great crime movies are made of, and with style: bloodstained diners, ritzy villas, grody slumhouses, paper- strewn police departments—this movie makes them all look good. The soul of noir is in these places, but they are flooded with brightness instead of cloaked in shadows, and there always seems to be a magic hour glow around the actors. The casting is almost absurdly spot-on: Kevin Spacey as a smarmy egoist, Danny DeVito as a fast-talking sleaze merchant, Russell Crowe as a brooding bruiser. These are big stars of the best sort, ones who make their names and their money on serious projects that please both crowds and critics. Everything about ""L.A. Confidential"" fits that bill, and it all works just as well here as it does in the best action thrillers, from the corrupt cops and the green rookies to the gangland executions and the epic shootouts. It's a genre piece, but an impeccable one. In a different year, one when ""Titanic"" wasn't sweeping up practically every award in sight, it could have netted half a dozen Oscars instead of just two from nine nominations.",L.A. Confidential
177,FairlyAnonymous,"3/4 of the movie is brilliant, but 1/4 of it almost breaks the entire film",7,11 July 2018,"I want to say that L.A. Confidential is a movie that I (somehow) had never heard of nor had any interest in seeing. I'm pretty sure I had seen the poster before, but that was all I knew of it. So even though I am reviewing this movie 20 years after its release, I have not had the plot spoiled to me (though I'm sure I've seen movie that were influenced by it). I'm going to try and avoid spending too much time on the positives of this film because I think there are some pretty glaring issues with this film that have gone unnoticed.That being said, the vast majority of this film is a blast to watch. Most of the characters are very interesting, unique, and well thought out which was probably the most important aspect of the film to get right (next to the story). Exley was my personal favorite because you could tell he genuinely cared about justice and keeping the law in order. He wins his fights by being smarter than everyone else and this makes him an interesting character. The main mystery of the movie is a little incoherent at times, but it was still rather engaging for me and I was invested in seeing where it would go. The strongest elements of this movie have to be the action and the character interaction. Almost all of the dialogue is sharp and entertaining to watch.
Now, onto the aspects of this film that I thought almost broke it: Bud White... my goodness is this character hard to watch. Russel Crowe does a great job portraying him, so it is not the fault of the actor, but the character himself is insufferable. Granted, my view on this is probably different than those who saw this movie in the 90s because the whole political climate as of late is different, but this guy is just an awful ""white knight"". Essentially, he is a ball of murderous rage 24/7 and is constantly looking for an excuse to save women who don't need saving. Oh, there is a woman with several men, how about I go over there and beat them up and then figure out if there is an issue. What makes him even worse is that he breaks the law and even plants evidence/lies on multiple occasions just to satisfy himself. For example, why didn't he tell the woman that there was a dead body under he house? It turns out that his reason for being a murderous killing machine against anyone who mistreats women is because his mom was abused to the point of death and he had to watch. Great, that kind of makes sense, but it doesn't excuse him pulling guns on people, starting fights, and grabbing people's crotches to torture them.Now, this is just one character, but unfortunately his ""romantic subplot"" is another big issue with this film.The romance in this movie sucks. It just does. It doesn't feel natural and it is entirely forced. Bud White somehow falls in love with a prostitute, but it is never explained WHY they fall in love. For instance, the prostitute says really cliche stupid stuff like, ""You're special"" or ""you're different"" but the only thing different about him is that ""he doesn't hide his emotions"" which is an incredibly stupid line because she HAS NEVER INTERACTED WITH HIM OUTSIDE OF HER HOUSE (except for them going to the movie on an occasion). Their romance is so forced that I was legitimately surprised when they started to make out, because there was no build-up to it.Fine, one bad romantic relationship, but this movie has TWO! WITH THE SAME GIRL!Exley goes to the prostitutes house to investigate her because he thinks the relationship between her and Bud White is false and that she was paid off to do it... and then he rapes/has sex with her?!?!?! It's really confusing because he has been established to be the brains of the team and is vastly smarter than everyone else, yet when he is prying for information from someone who he think is manipulating them he then decides to have sex with that said person and assumes that he is not being manipulated... by a prostitute.Really. A prostitute manipulating someone into sex? THAT IS LITERALLY THE FIRST THING THAT SHOULD COME INTO HIS MIND! What makes this plot point even worse is that it was a set-up and now Bud White tries to murder Exley in an attempt to get back at him for having sex with HIS prostitute (again, she is a prostitute. She is having sex with tons of people. Chillax). What makes things really odd is that the other cops in station don't seem to mind the fact that Bud White is murdering Exley? Someone walks into the room, Bud White pushes them out, and then no other cops investigate. Seriously? Long story short, all of this was the bad guy's plan (who was quite obviously the bad guy from the moment we saw him, so it wasn't really a plot-twist). The final action sequence was fantastic and really well set-up, and it was nice to see Exley and Bud White work together instead of at each other's throats. While I did enjoy the villain, his plan was super contrived and required a myriad of coincidences to actually work. Again, it's just a movie, but it is a little troublesome.The main theme of this movie seems to be that following the law completely doesn't always work but breaking the law constantly for the sake of justice isn't the best either. It's a compromise movie. However, the issue with this is that Exley pretty much got everything he wanted through brains and I don't think that he ever really needed Bud White... at all. I honestly can't think of a situation where Bud White's viciousness got him something that he couldn't have gotten himself. On the other end, I don't think Bud White ever learned to not be vicious. The only thing he possibly learned was to maybe not let his emotions get the best of him because he nearly killed Exley (and he hits the prostitute which makes him like his father), but then he goes back to being a psychopath right after that so I don't think he learned anything. This is a fairly big issue with the movie's message, because it doesn't really work. None of the characters (who are alive by the end of the movie) really change except for Exley, who allows more illegal activity to happen... yay?While I think the vast majority of this film is great, I think the biggest issue this movie has is the character drama and the movie's message. The character drama feels so forced and fake that I almost stopped watching the movie because I realized that the established traits of the characters didn't ultimately matter. Anyone could break character to make the plot go in a certain direction, which then cuts out any real sense of tension.Good movie, great acting, great action, okay mystery, bad drama, awful romance. That's my take on it, at least.",L.A. Confidential
178,krational66,A template for a complex plot,8,29 April 2020,"The absolute failure of a bad film lies in the scriptwriter, the relative success lies in the director.
The absolute success of not bad films lies in the director, the relative failure lies in the scriptwriter.At first glance, this seems to say that the writer is always bad and the director always makes things happen. In fact, there are at least two kinds of films that I have not discussed, ""good films"" and ""bad films"". Instead, I'm emphasizing the importance of screenwriting to a film, especially a drama. There is no good script, no matter how good the director is, he can only make a good film. Although it is said that the director is the soul of a movie, I have always believed that without a good script, the soul cannot be possessed. We have many good directors, but not many good works, largely because we don't have good screenwriters. I don't know since when, with the myth of the founding of the Chinese people can not tell a story? !Back to la confidential, which has won over a million awards for best screenplay, and to be fair, I've never seen a feature film with such a great story, ever! Here to add a word, many film masters and successful films are often set in one, their own written words into the image. The director of the film also participated in the main work of the scriptwriter, which undoubtedly laid a solid foundation for the success of the film. Never has a movie caused me to pause frequently during the movie (I usually like to watch it in a coherent way), or even back to the relevant paragraph for clues to the lines; And there's never been a movie that made me want to bang my head against a wall during a movie (I actually meant it for a moment), because the plot was so unexpected that I'll admit that my brain hasn't yet evolved Hollywood to an advanced stage. When the dust settles, the great lines, the great acting, the complex plot... All let me not long aftertaste.The seven main actors in the film, when the film, either has been a mature old drama bone, or is at the time of the big star, or is the future of the real power. You can imagine how much better it is for the audience to have so many excellent actors working together. With the elaborate lines and dialogue of the scriptwriters, it can be said that they complement each other perfectly. Russell Crowe's integrity and careless hands; Guy Pearce's self-effacing, calculating gentleman; Kevin Spacey looks like a handsome man... I haven't seen a movie like this for a long time that allows me to remember at least five characters at the same time after watching it. The last time was probably akira kurosawa's seven samurai.Actually, I really want to talk about the plot, but I can't bear to reduce your desire to see the movie by revealing the plot, so I have to make a few points. The film of such subject matter now general meeting gives the boundary of good and evil ambiguous change, this film is no exception. But specifically, there are many unique. The first three male heroes are all policemen, with different personalities, and the audience will most clearly like and dislike each other. When the murders ""seemingly"" (on the one hand, it does not knot, according to the story development on the one hand, the audience no matter from the rational or emotional also feel it should be the case, faintly feel someone to astray in the three police officers in order to continue to make dramatic conflicts, unexpected three evil suddenly appeared outside (turning point) are performed, and the case continues, this has led to absolute opposition between good and evil, and the audience a different attitude towards the protagonist and unified into support (in fact, the great hero personality differences stand together). And when the final triumph of good over evil (including its own desires), there is an ambiguous treatment in the end. Generally speaking, the plot design is ""ambiguous -- opposite -- ambiguous"", which is obviously different from the ambiguous to death design in Hong Kong films or the ambiguous to death design in domestic films.To compliment the plot, more than two hours of film, in the opening is less than half an hour to start, drag the audience in the water, and when the crowd seems to be over with the case has been held up some fatigue (because there are too many clues to the 7788), drama master again, and this time the power because of the large space in front of the bedding, old clues to add new clues, makes efforts to larger, more fierce, is infinite to the audience the enjoyment on the movie. If the first half of the audience can still participate as a crime solver, the second half of the audience can only be an honest outsider, because the development of the story has been beyond the ordinary experience of watching the film. The relationship between the main characters shifts as the story progresses, the center of gravity keeps moving, and before this tension is broken, that tension builds up again.The last thing I want to say is that some people will unconsciously compare it to ""two smoking barrels."" I think for a moment, the comparison is not very great, because the differences between the two are far greater than the similarities, although they both tell a very complex story seamlessly. ""Two barrels of smoke"" is notable for its lovely British humor, unique video style and brilliant rock music. ""La confidential,"" on the other hand, is shot in the traditional Hollywood style, and its score is mainly jazz, but the music is too monotonous, probably because of the time limit of the story. The highlight of ""la confidential"" lies in the fine lines of the writers and the excellent acting of the actors. The two schools of good and evil as well as the different personalities of the three main characters are also easy to lead the audience to participate. ""Two barrels of smoke"", on the other hand, dismisses the police for justice, mainly a bunch of people who don't represent justice, so the audience instinctively allows itself to stand off the screen and watch instead of getting into any of the characters. Of course, none of this means that the two countries are superior to each other. It's more due to cultural differences between the UK and the us.",L.A. Confidential

His performance is so great I could eat it all right up.The music score, as in so many detective stories, is jazz tinted with the occasional lonely trumpet insisting this is a 40s detective film noir. That is a bit cliché but the movie does change it up and it is not overly insistent.The dialogue is a bit too good to the point of fake, like real movie dialogue. It can get quite fast and smart, which means it lacks the natural stupid that can be found in real conversations. And the spicy dialogue makes another problem more apparent: actors are hard to understand. There is a lot of mumbling, under the breath speaking or speaking with a cigarette in the mouth.The biggest issue though is probably with the story. Like many detective stories tend to do, it has too many turns, requiring more attention than the aforementioned mumbling speech will allow. And when you find out what the motive is.meh, an old story.Despite the issues with the story, this film flows so well and is so well acted that everything else is just dust in the wind. It shouldn't be as good as it is, but it is.",L.A. Confidential
185,honorhorror,"An abandoned cinema gem sung by many, kicked away by Titanic.",10,1 August 2009,"1998 should be a memorable year not only because of the 11 Oscars sweep by the monstrous Titanic, but also because of an abandoned cinema gem that comes out and went away like a gentlemen. That is L.A.Confidential.The parallel storytelling used in this movie were never so fresh and intelligent. If you notice, the 3 cops were all portrayed out of an order, in separate scenes of reconciled scenes. This perfectionist technical undertone gave this movie a perfect presentation of a good novel in every aspect. To note, the camera moves fluently and was so rich in detail that you'd need 10 or more viewings to fetch everything intended. The mystery, although entirely implied and unfolded until the very last moments, was mounted up in a most entertaining way that the director actually achieved a balance between popular entertainment and subtle/intelligent arts. All in all, the presentation itself is a miracle and worth a viewing.Unlike most crime saga, L.A.Confidential assumed the role of a watchdog, a whistle-blower and an entertainer just like the 3 roles Crowe, Spacey and Pearce had in the story. While I recommended the Dark Knight only to those 20 years and older, I recommend this to 15 years and older because it will give them some very good lessons as a person who's about to enter the society. In other words, if interpreted properly, it can be really educating. Rarely could a detective story reflect the racial problem, corruption problem and the unhappy side of a golden age so detailed and realistically. Everything has a smell of 1950's thanks to the superb art decoration.The characters, are all memorable that I could even recite their lines scene by scene. Sargeant Bud White was all women-beaters' nightmare, but he's also a cheap asset who do the muscle job and didn't ask questions--a watchdog. Sargeant Jack Vincennes was an entertainer who enjoyed his little affiliation with Hollywood and utilized every opportunity filling his own self-filled respect and honor.Sargeant Ed Exley the whistle-blower/politician had no muscle or affiliation therefore must work his own way up to the attention of his Captain, the sophisticated Dudley Smith. For each of the 3 main cops, they've got their definitive little details, expressions and moments. Their early stories were all wrapped up in an exaggerated tone told by Sid Huggins' Hush-Hush magazine, realizing their run-of-the-mill status. Later in the movie, their interactions became some of the greatest moments in the movie history. The undertone dropped to a downright reality and dynamics, giving all the threads more fun too see. Well, I still want to talk about human nature portrayed, just that would consume all your time. So enjoy it by your self.It's been 12 years since its release and it's still ranking high in Top 64 on top 250. Another 12 years will only make it even more shiny. It's not a cult classic, but it's the greatest detective movie with a lot to think about. If anyone wants to appreciate techniques and performance, one should head for French Connection or Chinatown. If one wants to appreciate techniques, performances, musics, beauties and an up-beating story which delivers a practical/positive message using the darkest context, go for L.A.Confidential. Hush-hush! P.S. the scene with Lynn Bracken and Ed Exley was surveyed and represented in many English-learning programs, despite all the flexible usage of profanities.",L.A. Confidential
186,Gideon24,The Best Film of 1997,9,4 March 2015,"For my money, the best film of 1997 was LA Confidential, an atmospheric, richly complex, and completely riveting period piece centering on murder and police corruption in 1950's Los Angeles, superbly mounted by director Curtis Hanson.Brian Helgelund's flawless, Oscar-winning screenplay, adapted from a novel by James Ellroy, beautifully interlaces stories of growing organized crime in 1950's Los Angeles becoming a virus that is hard to control with police corruption that appears to be growing in equal doses.The film focuses on a series of brutal murders that become a primary focus for three very different kinds of cops. Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) is a straight-laced by-the-books cop trying to crawl from under the image of his late father, also a decorated officer of the law. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a cop who is serious about getting a criminal behind bars and who is not above beating a confession out of a perp or planting evidence on him to guarantee a conviction. He also has a weakness for damsels in distress and will walk through fire for a woman he feels is in danger. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is an officer who is more passionate about his job as the technical adviser on a television show than his actual police duties. It is the flawless interlacing of these three characters and their individual methods in pursuing justice that make this drama sizzle.This film is so beautifully constructed and such complete attention is required that if you miss five minutes of this film and then return to it, you will be totally confused...for me, the primary aspect of a perfect screenplay.Hanson has pulled uniformly superb performances from his hand-picked cast right down the line, with standout work from Crowe and Spacey. Kim Basinger won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress as a femme fatale who is central to the story and gets romantically involved with both Exley and White. Basinger is attractive in the role, but her Oscar win surprised me, though I will admit her chemistry with Crowe is off the charts here.Solid support is also provided by Danny De Vito, David Straithern, Ron Rifkin, Graham Beckel, and especially James Cromwell as various players involved in the twists and turns this story takes.Stunning art direction, cinematography, and costumes are icing on the cake in this textbook example of how to put a great crime drama on the screen. Remember: ""Off the record, on the QT, and very hush hush.""",L.A. Confidential

2) The relationships between the 3 leads are very engaging and the friendship between Pierce and Crowe by the end is very heartwarming
3) The mystery itself, the police politics and the solving of the case is very well toldNEGATIVES:1) I hate Kim Basinger's character. I think she's a terrible actress and it blows my mind that she won an Oscar for this film. Her entire character is just a love triangle story device and I definitely could've done without it

Kevin Spacey is his usual fabulous self as Jack Vincennes, a cynical cop, and Russell Crowe (""The Insider"", ""Gladiator"") is also riveting as Bud White.  And Kim Basinger is great in her Academy Award winning role of Lynn Bracken.  I think it's her greatest achievement.Winner of two Oscars, ""L.A.

189,sandnair87,Probes the Seamy Underbelly Beneath the Surface Allure of 1950's L.A!,9,16 April 2015,"Spicy and boiling-hot, the sensational noir style crime drama L.A. Confidential is a morality play disguised as pulp fiction - a sprawling saga of venality and redemption set against a flashy 1950's Los Angeles backdrop of easy money, blazing guns and cheap, illicit thrills told with a cool eye and overwhelming evil. Based on James Ellroy's 1990 novel, the movie's L.A. is a shining place where almost everybody has a guilty secret. That includes the triumvirate of LAPD cops - the flamboyant ""Hollywood Jack"" Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), the bare-knuckled brute veteran Wendell ""Bud"" White (Russell Crowe) and the straight-arrow, rich kid Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) - who are thrown together during several investigations and the scandalous tabloid journalist Hudgeons (Danny DeVito) who spews them out to the public. When a nightclub massacre leaves six dead, including a disgraced ex-cop, three black juveniles are arrested soon thereafter. But this apparently cut-and-dried case leads to more insidious developments. As our lead cops dig deeper into what at first seems a simple shootout in a downtown diner, they come to believe that the bust was a setup, the dead suspects fall guys and soon discover links to a furtive call-girl ring run by vice king Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), whose hookers (including Lynn Bracken played by Kim Basinger) have been surgically altered to resemble famous Hollywood stars. Despite their antagonism toward each other - exacerbated by their mutual attraction to Lynn - Exley and White link up to get to the bottom of it all. Drugs, prostitution, dirty politics in high places and mob wars - everything that feeds scurrilous magazines like Hudgeon's 'Hush Hush' becomes the reality the three cops disinter. And it gets worse as they go deeper. Ingeniously adapted by Curtis Hanson and his co-writer, Brian Helgeland, L.A.Confidential is a juicy noir stew of amorality that's gives us a richly populated, self-contained little world that operates according to its own rules. That world is unsavory and grim, an un-magical kingdom of gleaming mansions and corpses rotting in basements. But Hanson and his actors make it a world we believe. The three central cops are all pungent, colorful and terrifically well-played; their combined charisma almost smashing through the screen. Spacey oozes ring-a-ding charm and is slyly hilarious as preening, showboat cop Vincennes. Crowe bristles with hair-trigger tension and exudes a unique and sexy toughness. Pearce makes a wonderful prude who perfectly catches the ""no-flies-on-me"" swagger of a rich boy on the rise. Although she's playing a stock character, Basinger exudes a chaste sultriness and is terrific as a Veronica Lake double. The large supporting cast is tops, too. It's hard to imagine a better slimy scandal-sniffer than DeVito, a colder-hearted cop than Cromwell or a smugger vice lord than Strathairn.L.A. Confidential is a movie bull's-eye: noir with an attitude, a thriller packing punches that gives up its evil secrets with a smile.",L.A. Confidential
190,budmassey,Probably the best crime drama film noir since Chinatown.,10,5 July 2001,"Probably the best crime drama film noir since Chinatown.  Chock-a-block full of marquee talent, the story that starts off slow and escalates in a frightening spiral.Set in the early 1950's, a supposed golden age of American history.  World War II was a memory, and the Korean War was behind us.  There was nothing on the horizon but prosperity and peace.  Los Angeles sat on the verge of becoming the city it was destined to be, and is no more, and everything was right with the world.If it were only true.  A corrupt police force is almost indistinguishable from the organized criminals they oppose.  To make it even more apropos, one of L.A.'s finest is an advisor to a Dragnetish show and has quite a side business selling news scoops to a loathsome gossip columnist delightfully played by Danny DeVito.Kevin Spacey is the most consistent actor in the business, and his performance doesn't disappoint.  James Cromwell and David Strathairn are similarly sharp.  But the real gems are Guy Pearce, trying desperately to shed his Priscilla, Queen of the Desert past as the oh so anal Lt. Exley, and Russell Crowe, whose star potential was just being recognized by American audiences.  His brooding Bud White is the stuff of cinema legends, which Crowe will surely become.  Then there is Kim Basinger, who won a well-deserved Oscar.  She plays a hooker with astonishing elegance and grace, hallmarks of all Basinger's roles.  The stars don't produce as much chemistry between as around one another.  They seem to smolder with private fires that burn slightly out of reach of one another.  But it's still hot!",L.A.

192,Benjamin_Cox,"Evocative and thrilling, this is a cop movie with real class - 89%",9,4 April 2005,"For years, I was brought up to believe that the books were always better than the movies. And for a while, it made sense. I've read books like ""Jurassic Park"", ""The Lord Of The Rings"" (which I'm currently making my way through) and even the ""Star Wars"" novels are exciting, if a little basic, books. So when I spotted the Elmore Leonard's original on sale, I purchased a copy almost wholly on the reputation of the film. Big mistake - the language and prose ran all over the place and I just couldn't get into it at all. It still lays around, unfinished and probably always will now that I have the movie on DVD. And where words fail, pictures and sounds combine to tell the blistering story of corruption and determination in LA's police department.Set in the golden age of the early Fifties in Hollywood, ""L.A. Confidential"" introduces us to three very different cops with very different methods. Wonderkid Ed Exley (Guy Pierce) is the newly-assigned rookie, holding to the ideals of justice for all and playing the game by the rules. At the other end of the spectrum is 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe) who is little more than a suited thug with a badge and the support of his superior, Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell). Somewhere in the middle is Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), technical adviser to hit TV show ""Badge Of Honor"" and reliant on investigative reporter Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) to tell him what's going down in Hollywood, so he can turn up and arrest the suspects for the cameras with a smile on his face. Between them, they must investigate the apparent robbery of the Nite Owl café in which a former cop was slain.Despite the complex story and multiple protagonists, ""L.A. Confidential"" remains a captivating film which never lets go of your attention. The film is a wonderful recreation of a typical noir setting, bright and colourful on the surface but rotten to its corrupted core. Indeed, it seems like Exley is the last good man alive as the case gradually grows to encompass political corruption, seedy dirt digging and prostitution rackets - which brings us to the Oscar winning performance from Kim Basinger as high-class hooker Lynn Bracken. Considering that she has rarely been given an acting role as opposed to simply looking good on screen, Basinger is stunningly good as she raises her game to new heights and holds her own alongside the respected ensemble cast. But she is not alone - Crowe, DeVito and Cromwell are all superb and even former ""Neighbours"" star Pierce is exception as the increasingly desperate cop trying to hold onto his morals when everyone else threw theirs away long ago. The story twists and turns throughout and the ending was one I didn't see coming, which makes so much difference when you consider how many cop films end exactly as you predicted.There is no doubt at all that this film is special. From the cracking soundtrack to the authentic dialogue, evocative costumes to the picture-perfect view of a Hollywood that Raymond Chandler himself would be proud of. ""L.A. Confidential"" does everything right though, for me personally, I would like to have seen a new series of films in this style with Philip Marlowe (Chandler's private detective and star of many books) because that would quite possibly be one of my favourite films of all time. However, it doesn't feel right to criticise this film because it deserves all the praise I can offer. Compulsive, tense and gripping - everything a good cop movie should be. ""L.A. Confidential"" is a movie of timeless quality and a quantum leap ahead of the last film I watched last night on Channel 4 (the bloody dreadful ""Guest House Paradiso"").",L.A. Confidential
193,zfiany,"It's a movie that offers you a new story, witty plot, great actors, and brilliant characters",8,30 March 2009,"I always had something extra for movies that offer you many characters equally interesting and you have to choose one as the best. In L.A. Confidential, you have the brilliant character of Spacey my favorite in this movie, who goes with the flow and plays it brilliantly but he is honest from the inside and without his brilliance the case wouldn't have been solved. Then, you have the character of Russle Crowe, the emotional who has no control over his feelings and his physical strength helps as well in solving the pieces of the puzzle, and finally the character of Guy Pearce who is smart, overly ambitious, and his jealousy which comes from his insecurity makes him act irrationally in a way different than that of Crowe. You have these three ingredients, add to them Devito and Basinger and you will have a delicious movie cocktail.I don't know if anyone remembers the scene of the atheist, in ""Five Card Stud"" with Dean Martin, who before he dies he puts his hands in a way as if he was praying though he is atheist from which Martin was able to know that the criminal is the priest (Robert Mitchum). Spacey does something of the like in the movie. I love these brilliant spices which makes the plot smarter and more entertaining.",L.A. Confidential

This film is awesome, and Russell Crowe is a revelation.  This film explains how an actor relatively unknown in America at the time, got the leading part in such an important and expensive film as Gladiator.  This man is the most impressive actor in motion pictures at the moment and it can only be a matter of time before he is rightly awarded by the Academy.

195,cosmorados,In common with all great films...,9,6 June 2008,"It's distinction is its lack of a bad scene. This is one of those films that is great to watch and familiarise yourself with and then comeback to later on. The film itself is made exceptional by a cast that you the viewer seem unable to take your eyes off as the film progresses.In this film there are a number of great performances but three in particular are exceptional. Guy Pearce as Lt. Exley is perfectly cast as the ambitious young cop anxious to prove himself better than even his father's fearsome reputation, with Kevin Spacey in equally fine fettle as the movie star of cops, Jack Vincennes, using every ounce of charm to create a Dino-esquire portrayal that's perfect in this period piece. But the tour-De-force of performances comes from a man so chilling in his ability to switch from hostile to psychopathic in seconds is Russell Crowe as Bud White. Before seeing this film I had never seen Crowe in anything and wondered where the hell he had come from and who he was, as his portrayal of White is one of the best I have ever seen, so complete is his immersion in the skin of this viscous detective.Through the eyes of these cops we see a town where, as the poster says, everything is for sale, everyone has a price and nothing is what it seems.For anyone thinking of giving this film a try who may have missed it the first time round it is well worthy of a viewing.Nuff said.Em",L.A.

197,Jakemcclake,A More Complex and Less Realistic Chinatown,8,17 October 2013,"I saw this movie about 16 years ago, but it is pretty memorable. Any movie that can imitate Chinatown is pretty memorable and a ""must see"".This movie is a Chinatown rip-off.But, with a capital B, the movie will introduce several themes, and too many characters before getting to a happier but much more unrealistic and much more violent ending.As for themes the movie introduces Good Cop/Bad Cop, Racial Issues, Violence against a woman you care about committed by someone who hates violence against women, the ultimate Evil dude behind it all, and veritable war within LA which forces two former enemies to team up.At the beginning of the movie, I got lost with all of the numerous characters that were brought into the story. You may as well write a movie about the life of every player in the NBA, it was getting that complex. I knew that no one in their right mind would try to make a story about all of these characters, and I was right. Most were killed off.The movie is really about who is behind all the killings and other wrong doings in LA. When you finally find out, you'll see the ultimate evil guy, kinda like John Houston's - Noah Cross in Chinatown. Then instead of the more real but sad, depressing Chinatown ending, we get...WAR, being fought by two characters against an Army who fight for the bad dude. When the about one millionth bullet is finally shot (no I didn't try to count them), we get a happy but less real ending than Chinatown.",L.A. Confidential
198,Bil-3,***** Best Film of the 90s,10,17 February 2000,"Hands-down my favourite American film of the nineties. Curtis Hanson shocked the world by proving to be not only a great director but an auteur with this unbeatable adaptation of James Ellroy's terrifying novel about corruption and crime among members of the LAPD in the 1950s. The hard-boiled detective story angle is brought to life so beautifully, mostly because Jeannine Claudia Oppewall's production design recreates the dark underside of the 50s to such perfection that not even a Coke bottle label is missed. Add to that Dante Spinotti's stunning lighting that rides the fine line between artistic and believable comfortably (as all period camerawork should), Ruth Myers' costume designing and a script by Hanson and The Postman scribe Brian Helgeland (I know, I don't get it either) that pares down Ellroy's mammoth plot about a multiple murder in a local diner involving a policeman with suspicious ties without sacrificing the density of the story or the spiderweb of events involved with it, and you have the best movie of 1997, not to mention the most fascinating detective film ever made since Orson Welles' Touch of Evil. The cast is all brilliant, most notably Kim Basinger as a wordly prostitute who has not only a heart of gold but a mind of steel--Basinger is so strong in her character's every nuance you'll find yourself forgetting she's even acting--and Kevin Spacey as a Dean Martin-esque detective who not only solves an important part of the puzzle, he even discovers he possesses a soul beneath his flashy suits. I just can't get enough of this film.",L.A. Confidential
199,Lucabrasisleeps,"Intelligent, well crafted thriller",10,3 January 2009,"It is funny how ignored this movie is today. Most of the time it just isn't mentioned. But I feel it is one of the best movies in the film noir genre(not that I am an expert in this genre!). It is not just a thriller. It is in fact a movie which portrays the 1950's effectively in such a way that we are transported to that 1950's era of race relations, gender relations and the general corruption in society. It is a battle of personalities and attitudes.The story is quite complex and it took me some time to figure it all out. Murders at the Nite Owl, a bar in Los Angeles, are the focus of the story. There are many disparate events that happen in the movie which are somehow connected. They are joined together at the end in an effective manner which doesn't defy logic. That is quite rare in movies today. It moves like a classic whodunit(one of my favourite genres) and is generally the kind of movie I like. The character development is of high priority here and the characters are neatly fleshed out before the actual story begins. Each scene is important here and each little point is important to the resolution of the mystery. I think repeated viewings might bring out some more details that I missed the first time. The story also involves a prostitute who falls in love with one of the characters. She has a very important role in this movie.The main characters are three detectives named Ed Exley(Guy Pearce), Bud White(Russell Crowe) and Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey). Their conflicting ideals and attitude to life are perfectly portrayed. My favourite character in this movie is Ed Exley with his pacifist and intelligent attitude to police work. My favourite line in the movie ""Is that how you ran the good cop bad cop"" after an intense scene has now become one of my favourite lines. His steadfast devotion to his ideals and standing up to the ""system"" was pleasing to watch. I personally believe that this performance was better than his Memento performance because of the complexity and likability of his character. Russell Crowe as Bud White gives a sterling performance as the tough cop who is not amused with Exley's approach to law enforcement. It may be a clichéd performance as the tough guy with a softer side but he does a good job. Kevin Spacey, as usual, is great in this role as the cop, Jack Vincennes, who loves publicity and glamour. He is more complex than he initially appears in this movie. Kim Basinger as the prostitute named Lynn Bracken also has a good part where she looks sexy as ever(hard to believe she is 40 in this). She gives a worthy performance and she is one of the pivotal characters in this movie.The best thing about the movie is the dialogue. It has a clever style reminiscent of 1940's film noir classics. The movie has a relaxed style throughout with flashes of violence which erupt suddenly. Some of the scenes can stun you as they suddenly come out of nowhere. The relaxed style is what makes the violent scenes seem even more violent. The newer filmmakers must learn from this in the new era where they try to shock people with more violence upon violence. The music is another factor that gives it a 1950's feel. The viewer sometimes may feel helpless at the racism and the police officers attitude towards Exley(at least I did). It is not just a cold lifeless murder mystery but instead it is a vibrant look at the dark seedy underbelly of Los Angeles and the helplessness of a man who holds tightly to his ideals. The scene where he tries to hold back the other officers in the police station brawl is a great example. Overall, highly recommended to people who like detective stories and people who like film noir. But even others who just love good stories with complex characters should enjoy this movie.10/10",L.A.

203,jaredpahl,"Hollywood Noir At Its Seedy, Stylish Best",10,17 September 2019,"Film noir. It's like my own cinematic femme fatale. Attractive in its look, with shadows and neon and pinstriped suits, and often complicated underneath, the genre of detective stories and crime thrillers is seductive to this film connoisseur. I approach every film noir with anticipation. And yet, just like the dames who lure in an unsuspecting private eye, these films often leave me burned. Burned by mysteries whose hooks never catch or whose resolutions leave me baffled. And I still come back. Why? Because of films like L.A. Confidential. Curtis Hanson's adaptation of James Ellroy's novel represents the peak of what the genre can do. It outclasses Chinatown, overshadows Double Indemnity, upstages The Maltese Falcon. If those great films are the seduction, L.A. Confidential is the orgasm. This is the very best film noir.Three characters drive the mystery at the heart of L.A. Confidential. Police detectives Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) the by-the-book rookie, Bud White (Russell Crowe) the bruiser, and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) the crooked veteran, lead an investigation into The Nite Owl Murders, each tackling the case in their own way, and each forming a tenuous connection with a mysterious woman named Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger). Here is where most film noirs stop; with a case for the protagonist to solve, and characters who will reveal their secrets along the way. But L.A. Confidential is not so simple. It doesn't unfold as an episodic progression of events, but rather as a growing and building, tapestry of mystery. The secondary characters involved do not enter the plot in tidy, regularly-scheduled interludes, but in ever-shifting, fluid ways.Describing the plot any further would detract from the surprise of watching this mystery unfold. The Academy-Award-winning script by Hanson and Brian Helgeland finds a way to not only streamline Ellroy's sprawling novel, but dramatically enhance its underlying themes. We are kept abreast of all the plot's developments, never getting lost in the shuffle of characters, dealings, and unsaid secrets. And because the hook catches so easily, the film's carefully timed surprises work completely. What we are dealing with here is a case-study in mystery writing. More than almost any other crime thriller I've seen, L.A. Confidential invites audience investment, leading us along, convincing us we've got an idea of where it's headed before revealing a card that was there the whole time. I was riveted by this story, active in trying to figure out where the mystery was headed and thunderstruck by a shocking third act denouement.I was also, crucially, invested in these characters. Credit goes to the cast. Pearce is a natural rooting interest at the film's core, and Crowe and Spacey bring nuance to their broadly drawn characters. Elsewhere a veritable Hall of Fame lineup of character actors bring Hanson's vision of 1950s L.A. into razor-sharp focus. James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, and David Strathairn lend juicy, colorful support to the film. These are three of the best to ever do it, all working at their creative maximum. Kim Basinger is the one to come out with a gold statue for her work, and she is great as the damaged object of our cops' affection, but everyone here is Oscar-worthy, straight down the line. One of the great ensemble performances I've ever seen.And then there's Curtis Hanson, and the 50s Hollywood underground he and his collaborators resurrect in fabulous detail. L.A. Confidential is a lush period production featuring authentic costumes and sets, photographed with assured style by Dante Spinotti, lending the sleazy underbelly of Hollywood an alluring technicolor shine. Hanson's direction is ultra-confident as well. It's enough to keep the audience firmly on the story's track until the last shot, but for a movie with an arsenal of guns, shootouts, and the like, it's quite an achievement that Hanson makes us fear for every bullet. Hanson doesn't do movie violence. He does violence that is real and scary. When the guns go off, you can feel your heart in your throat. It's powerful. Real excitement. Topping it all is a brilliant, pounding jazzy score by Jerry Goldsmith, yet another reliable professional contributing their best work.The best films have a way of activating our mind, of forcing us to sit up and pay attention, and of rewarding us in turn. The act of watching L.A. Confidential is not a passive admiration of craft, as so many film noirs are. It's an active process, tempting us to try connecting the dots ourselves. You watch it with your eyes wide open, searching the screen, observing faces, trying to find cover in a gunfight. It's so much more exhilarating, so much more satisfying than any other film noir I've seen. It's grand where everything else seems small, it's fast where others are slow. It's glorious to look at and even better to think about.98/100",L.A. Confidential
204,Arkaan,Truly Brilliant (spoilers inside),8,6 September 1999,"I haven't seen Chinatown, so I can't compare the two, but LA Confidential is a twisty crime drama, filled with amazing performances and a great plot.  The acting is great.  The male leads are filled with relish and are convincing.  Kim Basinger is great, though I would not have given her the oscar over Julianne Moore.  The script is amazing.  Interesting trivia: In 1995, James Cromwell and Kevin Spacey were competing against each other for best supporting actor.  In this movie, Cromwell gets to shoot Spacey.  Talk about revenge.  Number 4 on my top ten of 1997, after The Sweet Hereafter, Gattaca, and Contact.",L.A. Confidential
205,David_Brown,Should have won the Oscar,10,14 October 2013,"There is one thing that most people who have seen LA Confidential can agree on it should have beaten out Titanic as Best Picture of the year. The performances are flawless, obviously Kim Basinger as Lynn Bracken was the Standout ( winning the Oscar), but so was everyone else. The unusual Thing is there is really is only one good guy in the movie which was ""Bud"" White ( Russell Crowe), who although a violent person was decent and heroic. I go back to to what Lynn said to Lieutentent Exley ( Guy Pearce). "" you're afraid of Bud because you can't figure out how to play him. He doesn't follow the same rules of politics as you do . It makes him dangerous. I see Bud because I want to. I see But because he can't hide the good inside of him. I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who f---s for money. I see Bud because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is. I see Bud for all the ways he is different from you."" Spoilers Ahead: Another difference, is he takes bullets for Exley, when the corrupt Captain Dudley Smith ( James Cromwell), tried to kill him. Another difference is Exley shot Smith in the back ( instead of arresting him or at least looking him in the eye, which of course, is cowardly). Smith, is really the worst one of all who wanted to take over the drug trade, and murdered fellow Police Officer Jack Vincennes ( Kevin Spacey), in his own home. Other miserable characters are the deep in the closet, DA, blackmailer Sid Hudgens ( Danny DeVito), and every other character except Bud and Lynn. The ending apparently said it all where the Crooked Smith and the murderous Exley are made out to look like heroes and as Lynn put perfectly "" some men get the world ( Exley), and others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona ( White).""However, I am not so sure that Exley won, because "" And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your soul?"" ( Mark: 8:36). I think White was the winner because he was at least able to get to Arizona with Lynn. Is she perfect? No but she does love him, and he was able to not only survive ( unlike Smith and others), but can at least look at himself in the mirror ( unlike Exley). Basically this film is a masterpiece that should have won the Oscar. 10/10 Stars",L.A. Confidential
206,benjyboom,Pros and cons,4,5 November 2019,"Pros:
Good soundtrack and setting, effective as a period piece
Good main characters, decent examples of good and bad cops, good acting as wellCons:
Confusing and messy main mystery, very few satisfying or clever beats throughout, ends in a pretty cliche way
Kevin Spacey's character and story were just not developed very much at all
Boring villain
So many parts just toss names at you as if you're supposed to know all these assholesBest part: Bloody Christmas, solid representation of police fraternity being used as an avenue for brutality, also good characterization for Ed Exely
Worst part: anyone of the criminal confessions near the end, very little to flesh out or clear up the main conflict",L.A. Confidential
207,Blade_Le_Flambeur,Fantastic Detective Story,9,18 April 2003,"L.A. Confidential surpasses many other detective films like Insomnia for many reasons. First off, the performances for all three leads are incredible as well as the supporting characters. They portray their characters with utter perfection, and they never actually expose themselves, but instead rather lose themselves in their parts and lets the viewers understand them. Kevin Spacey as the celebrity cop, Guy Pearce as the golden boy Policeman and of course Russlle Crowe as a brutal yet sensitive police officer. The supporting acting by James Corwell and Danny Devito are excellent as well, but Kim Basinger was only good in it. In terms of the script, it was amazing, a very accurate depiction of 1950's L.A. Each character has this unique sense to them and it comes out in their lines. In terms of photography, this movie isn't very lush but isn't too gritty either so it's not exactly excellent. Curtis Hanson provides a very thorough direction of all the information on paper, but he lacked a real punch and the movie ended up not being brilliant and breathtaking. As for the oscars, Kim Basinger didn't deserve best supporting actress for her role because she didn't really do that much. Adapted screenplay was very well earned, though I haven't read the novel so I can't really talk about the ""adapted"". However, Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe needed to be nominated for their fine performances, as well as Guy Pearce. This movie deserved Best Picture over Titanic for sure, but doubts around Best Director. A solid look at crime and detective works, but overall it lacks a really fluent narrative. 9.5/10",L.A. Confidential
208,K-Slicer,The Best Movie Ever Made,10,19 March 2001,LA Confidential is the Best Movie Ever Made.  I think it was robbed of Best Picture of 1997 at the Oscars.  Kim Basinger had the best performance in the entire movie as a seemingly cold-hearted prostitute who realizes the mistakes and is sorry later. She is my favorite actress and this is best performance to date.  The plot is really hard to understand at first but it is easier to understand with a second viewing.  This movie showed me that problems like drug dealing and corruption were relevant back then as they are now.  Curtis Hanson took a difficult to adapt novel and made a very edgy and twisted mystery thriller.  The cast is one of the most memorable in movie history.  The crew did a very good job in making a back lot studio look like LA in the 1950's.  LA Confidential is my personal favorite and one of the best movies ever.  I give it a 10!,L.A. Confidential
209,thehumanduvet,A true modern classic,10,23 February 2001,"This great throwback to cop/gangster flicks of the golden age is a wonderfully realised treat for fans of the genre and all movie lovers, featuring a gang of top stars on blistering form, working from a brilliant script under very classy direction. Shades of noir classic Touch of Evil hang over this cracking thriller (check out the oil pumps pounding away in the background in the finales of both films), dealing with moral and political shenanigans in the LAPD and the movie-star-and-drug-baron milieu of Marlowe and Sam Spade. Spacey, Crowe and Guy Pearce head a brilliant cast that includes great turns from Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger and James Cromwell, all caught up in a fantastically complex web of corruption and crime that unravels itself beautifully as the film builds to its pounding climax. At heart though this is a moral picture looking at the pursuit of justice in an ethically complex world, and a buddy picture about tough men overcoming their differences to pull together towards a common goal of good over evil. A great soundtrack of period tunes and a few deft touches of humour put the finishing touches on a film that comes pretty near perfection.",L.A. Confidential
210,kylehodgdon,Not As Cool As It Wants To Be,6,25 December 2009,"I initially watched this movie back in 2000. In 2009, I was going through movies on IMDb to rate them and when I came across this I could not remember it at all. It had such a great rating and marvelous reviews, so I decided to watch it again.I now know why I did not recall the film initially: it really is not that good. It's okay, it's watchable, but I really do not know why so many people like it so much.It felt like this movie was trying to be too cool. I mean, no one talks like the characters in this movie do. With the amount of ""cool lingo"" that they use I began to get lost with exactly what the characters were really saying. It's is okay to a point, but this movie did it far too much where it became distracting and very unrealistic. I really didn't care too much for the plot itself either. Again, it was okay, but I can think of plenty other cop dramas that are far superior to this one.Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors and Russell Crowe is usually very solid, but neither one did anything for me in their respective roles. I know many people disagree with me on this, but to me they both meandered along and never really shined. And the gun fight at the end was poorly done. Why can the good guys get shot multiple times and be just fine to continue, but the bad guys are always dead with one shot?I give this movie a six and say that it is ""slightly above average"". It is an okay watch, but there are many better movies of the same genre out there.",L.A. Confidential
211,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Tough, Highly Entertaining, and well acted thriller",10,17 January 2005,"L.A. Confidential is about police corruption in the 1950's. The acting is great, of course you can never go wrong with Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe, but there are plenty of great supporting actors like Guy Pierce, Jim Cromwell, and Kim Bassinger. (Possible Spoilers) The story is centered around a shooting in a diner that leads to a trail of mystery, violence, and corruption. The suspects of the shooting are a group of black guys who steal shotguns, one of the victims is an associate of a mysterious multimillionaire, another victim is a fellow cop. Three cops, Sgt. Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey), Officer Wendell White(Russell Crowe), and Detective Lt. Ed Exley(Guy Pierce) use their own morals and skills to try to figure out what seemed like just a diner bloodbath, but is a lot more than what it seemed.There is plenty of excitement and entertainment in L.A. Confidential, and the acting is really good. Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey had back to back Oscar nominations after making this movie. L.A. Confidential is a little bit confusing the first time you see it, so it does deserve more than one viewing. I'd recommend this for the next time you want to watch a movie that is entertaining and has a good story.",L.A. Confidential
212,susansweb,I just can't get over the ending -- too pat.,6,22 January 2003,"One of the strengths of this movie was that it was an old-fashioned film noir made without any of the constraints that the old studio system would have required.  The old studios rules were that: good always will prevail (check), there must be a romance (check, in a movie as cynical as this one the Kim Basinger - Russell Crowe romance really seems out of place) and possible redemption (check, Kevin Spacey).  This wouldn't have bothered me except the first part of the movie was so good and was moving towards a modern (complicated and unresolved) finish when it was like the studio swooped in and said ""No, we better make sure there is a happy ending so we won't offend anyone.""  Oh sure, there is plenty of profanity and a big emphasis on sex, drug use and racism to give ""L.A. Confidential"" the modern edge but where's that ""Forget it, it's Chinatown, Jake"" finish?",L.A.

213,Don-102,Spectacular Cop Drama That Rivals CHINATOWN...,10,27 March 1999,"This stylish, action-filled cop story is maze-like in plot and looks absolutely incredible. Not only is there an Oscar winning performance by Kim Basinger, but a discovery of 2 fine Australian actors, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce. They seem as American as apple pie on-screen, bringing to life the main protagonists of James Ellroy's novel. The hard-boiled script by director Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland brilliantly follows through with the evolution of these seemingly one dimensional characters, both on opposite sides of a police officer's moral code, who find they have a lot more in common than first glimpsed. Sure, its a recollection of film-noir, but it is without a doubt a 90's film. The 1950's are relived with great nostalgia and period set-ups, however, it is not the showcase of the film. Its plot and acting are what is so great.Kevin Spacey headlines the troupe, playing slick Detective Jack Vincennes, a consultant to ""Badge of Honor"", a fictional TV show based on Dragnet I guess. There are many nuances to real-life people and events, not the least being Lana Turner in a hilarious scene, or Johnny Stompanato, her mob bodyguard boyfriend who was later shot to death by Turner's own daughter (not in the movie). Spacey is the cop who ""busted Mitchum"" which he takes great pride in. Crowe is such a presence as the brutish enforcer who has a soft spot for abused women for a very good reason. This is where Basinger, a Veronica Lake look-alike (and noir film fixture), is able to come across as a hooker with a mind and ambition beyond what she does. It's a good performance, maybe not Oscar-worthy, but noteworthy, nonetheless. Pearce plays the stodgy, son of a cop lieutenant, who along with Crowe, realizes there is more at stake here than a simple murder/robbery.To get into any more plot aspects or characterizations would be ridiculous. Just view the film and see how unique and important it is. This is not your usual police squad period portrait. Most importantly is L.A. CONFIDENTIAL's ending, which consists of a shootout, something that would usually turn movie buffs away. 9 out of 10 cop dramas end this way uneffectively. Here, we see a revelation. A shootout that holds you in a trance and surprises with each blow. It is to climactic shootouts what FRENCH CONNECTION was to car chases. As far as comparison to CHINATOWN, there really is none. This is not to say they do not belong in the same league. They even have the same Musical composer, Jerry Goldsmith, who again utilizes the trumpet to resonate corruption and deception. These are 2 distinctly different visions of Los Angeles cop warfare. CHINATOWN was more of a character study and had more to say on some pretty deep issues. It took place pre-WWII and was a direct homage to the dark noir pix of the 40's and 50's. L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, while deep in substance in its own right, is more action oriented and simpler. Both will always stand as a testament to old-style police melodrama.NOTE: Like CHINATOWN, see it in its 2.35:1 aspect ration, the widest of Widescreen images.RATING: 10 of 10",L.A. Confidential

215,Travis_Bickle01,Best thriller of the late '90,9,3 April 2005,"Amazing thriller directed by Curtis Hanson and based on the novel of James Ellroy. The story is marvellous and intriguing. The cast consists of some of the greatest actors of the past ten years with names like Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe. Although the movie is rather long (2.15h), you will have the impression it lasts less. The story and the acting will keep you on the edge of your seat all the time.I loved Kevin Spacey's acting performance. He was outstanding as usual. Together with Russell Crowe, I think he's one of the biggest discoveries in the movie world of the past 10 years. Both actors keep surprising me with their perfect performances every time I see them in a movie. Danny DeVito is also very funny in this movie. Each time I see him on the screen, I just start laughing, even when he hasn't said a word yet. Kim Basinger does not only look perfect, she gives a wonderful acting performance as well. She should take good roles more often. Finally there was Guy Pearce. Although he gives a nice performance, he still has to wait another 3 years until he big breakthrough with ""Memento"". Everyone should see this movie. It is a real classic and he is definitely worth watching. The cast contains big names, the acting is marvellous and the story is unique.

216,fred-83,Brilliant,10,15 March 2000,"I agree with many other comments here, this is without a doubt one of the best movies of the 90s. I will never forget the joy of watching it for the first time (on tape) and being completely blown away, I was actually jumping out of my chair. The acting, the plot twists, Goldsmiths music. Everything was completely dead on target. Who would have expected this stroke of genius from Curtis Hanson? An absolute masterpiece, sometimes movies this good actually gets made in Hollywood.",L.A. Confidential
217,Chuck-149,One of the best in the genre.,8,12 September 1999,"Most film-noir movies are pretty good.  Personally, I think the best is ""Chinatown"" followed closely by ""The Maltese falcon"".  However, there haven't been that many recent film-noir movies that rank way up there in the best film-noirs of all-time.  But L.A. Confidential is different, so allow me to present to you my third favorite film-noir.  Masterfully directed by Curtis Hanson, it IS, in my opinion, the best movie of 1997.  Kim Basinger's performance was definitely of Oscar-winning quality and I'm glad she won best supporting actress.    The story basically revolves around this: Three cops, their captain, their precinct, a big-shot criminal in prison, a murder in a diner, a rich man, prostitutes, and a writer.  Kevin Spacey plays Jack Vincennes, a hot-shot policeman known especially for being the technical advisor of Brett Chase, the actor playing the main cop in the fictional TV show ""Badge of honor"". Russell Crowe plays Bud White, the physically strong officer who is especially impartial to women beaters.  And finally, the third hero, Ed Exley played by Guy Pearce, who is the smartest, most honest (if not too honest) cop around.  These three cops represent the three main aspects of their police precinct: Brains, courage, and honor.  A gruesome murder is committed in a small diner.  Ed Exley takes the case. The only problem is that he is despised by most men in the precinct.  Bud White wants a piece of the case because his ex-partner was killed at the diner and Jack Vincennes just wants to keep out of it so he can make money working for Cid Hutchons (Danny DeVito) busting criminals, working narcotics.  However, we soon realize that the murder connects all three characters together and involves much more including a beautiful call-girl named Lynn (Kim Basinger).  There aren't any flaws in this movie and Curtis Hanson picks up the ""Chinatown"" aspect extremely well making this, in a way, the ""Chinatown"" of the 90's because it's just so good.  As usual, Spacey delivers a tour-de-force performance which includes action and laughs.  Danny DeVito is excellent as well. David Starthairn is terrific as Pierce Patchet, the millionaire who seems to have something to do with everything that goes around in L.A.  James Cromwell is equally good as the wise police captain. See it.",L.A. Confidential
218,mrbluto,Long Dull and confusing,3,10 May 2002,"L.A.

219,lopcar1993,The best Neo-Noir ever made!!!,10,27 August 2009,"I'm a major fan of film noir I love everything about the mood , the dim lighting, the dark colors and the dark story but I'm here to tell you that this film has none of those qualities. You see this film is what you call a neo-noir it's not exactly a film noir but it also is at the same time. L.A. Confidential is what you call a masterpiece among crime films it's so perfect, so well done and so well acted to the point you don't even realize that your watching a film, you see when you watch L.A. your living a film which is something of very extreme rarity and pleasure.When this film was released in 1997 nobody was interested in it and from it's box office opening it showed. But after just a week in theaters this film started to rack up the dough although it could have made allot more than what it did L.A. Confidential was a moderate box office success but it's popularity didn't stop, no this films fame and didn't end with it's theatrical run it soon became an instant Saturday night favorite and a landmark film effectively jump starting the ""Neo-Noir"" genre and ushering in a whole new era of crime films, many films have tried to copy this style and many have failed( actually all have failed.) but this film has been so widely acclaimed by critics and fans alike that even if you could copy it's style, even if you could mimics it's appeal, even if you could copy the sense of humor and the sense of justice and brilliance that it had you would never be able to capture the awe and glamor that this film has it's so grand and beautiful that if your a filmmaker at heart you'll almost want to cry.L.A. Confidential is perfect in every way imaginable there isn't a single flaw or a single clique that exist in this film and let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film so much and if you have the heart for a period piece crime drama then look no further, this is the film.

220,Mr_PCM,This is how a proper crime story should be told!,10,3 February 2006,"LA Confidential is a sprawling epic tale of crime, corruption and justice in Hollywood and the LAPD, with a cast to match. A truly gripping crime saga exposing the seedy underbelly of the City of Angels, where cops never let the truth get in the way of justice, and everyone knows everyone else's dirty secrets.Criminally overlooked at both the box office and the Academy thanks to the all-conquering and over-achieving Titanic, LA Confidential will far more likely stand the test of time to be thought of as one of the best films of the 90s, and possibly the best cop film ever.After cops give a number of inmates a beating in retaliation for two of their own being put in hospital, the career-minded Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) agrees to testify to what he saw, turning in his fellow officers. When one of the cops forced out turns up dead as a result of a shooting, Exley, hothead detective Bud White (Russell Crowe) and fame-obsessed Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) all work to find the answers. However, as they uncover the truth, it leads to more questions, of corruption, blackmail, bribery and conspiracy.The film superbly portrays the dual nature of Hollywood; glamorous parties and beautiful people, and the seemingly ever-present crime and corruption, even in the police. Danny Devito's opening monologue perfectly sums it up - 'There's trouble in paradise'. This is not the city at the end of the rainbow, the city where dreams come true.A series of stellar performances from an all-star cast makes it impossible to pick the star, although Kim Basinger richly deserved her Best Supporting Actress. Kevin Spacey is terrific as ever, while Russell Crowe shows that Gladiator wasn't his first muscles-with-a-heart role. But the real standout is probably Guy Pearce in a career-making performance as the one officer determined to what is right and just, regardless of the potentially disastrous consequences for him. However, LA Confidential is a true ensemble piece, and everybody holds their own among the starry cast. Few will have made many better films, before or since.Curtis Hanson directs in a career-defining role, the sweeping direction echoing the sprawling nature of both the story and the city. The story is a slow-burner, gradually unraveling all the twists, but instead of clearing up the mystery, the waters become muddier as the trio of officers are forced to work together. Hanson masterfully commands the James Ellroy's source material, weaving it into a gripping multi-layered tale. The characters are extremely well developed, all three-dimensional, with no clear-cut heroes and villains. White (Crowe) in particular is the classic film noir anti-hero, the violent cop with a heart-breaking story, thinking with his muscles rather than his brain. LA Confidential is a classic 50s noir film told for the 90s, and keeps you guessing right up to the final scene as to how high the corruption goes. The two-hour running time is never felt.A superb thriller and the perfect antidote to the rash of mindless action-comedies that frequently come out of Hollywood today, LA Confidential harks back to how film-making used to be  all about telling a story. And what a story it is. One of, if not the best film of the 90s.",L.A. Confidential

Many entertain me, some make me laugh, some make me cry, some give me new ideas on how to handle or live life. Some I know are kind of bad, but I love them for the atmosphere(Sliver for instance), some are good, but I don't love them(Shawshank Redemptions). And very few are absolutely perfect for me.Here on IMDb, I rated less than two hand full of movies 10/10. L.A. Confidential is one of them. I've seen it 5 or 6 times now and I try not to be too biased, I try to see if maybe I give it a 10/10 because I like it so much that I overlook some flaws. But I just can't find any. The cast is brilliant, down to the smallest role! Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey...they all would have deserved an Oscar for this one! This seems to be the kind of movie that would make even average actors look good. Maybe that's why this was Kim Basinger's only Oscar? I really can't remember her being very memorable in any other movie but this one. And compared to the male cast, she doesn't even shine that much to me(even though she did a great job).The sets...oh, how I love the sets. I often wonder how they managed to pull off such an amazing L.A. of the 50's, but in the 90's. The cars, the suits, every small detail seems to fit perfectly. I think the only other movie I saw that managed to make L.A. look so beautiful is ""Heat""(another 10/10). The soundtrack is amazing as well. Many say L.A. Confidential is the China Town of the 90's, so it makes sense that they got Jerry Goldsmith to do the soundtrack(since he did it for China Town). It's such a shame that no one seems interested to make movies like this one these days. It's all CGI, all some young actors I never heard of(and don't really want to either) and a lame excuse of a story. It seems like film makers in the US forgot that a good movie should have a good story. I heard that they used China Town as an example on how to write a good story for movies in the 80s and afterwards. They should do that nowadays with L.A. Confidential. No matter how often I see this movie, I never get tired of it. It has such a great atmosphere and I think it's the atmosphere that can make a movie a true classic. Heat, China Town, Blade Runner...all movies with atmosphere, all movies we consider classics. Please add L.A. Confidential to that list.",L.A. Confidential

Their investigations uncover a rape, a call girl ring, a police corruption scandal, and more other stuff than I can remember right now.In a typical cop movie, you're lucky to find one interesting character. L.A. CONFIDENTIAL has three leads, all of whom are fascinating.  Never have I seen three men who so finely tread the line between good and evil.Ed Exley, magnificently realized by Guy Pearce, is a wholesome, bespectacled young man of seemingly iron-clad integrity.  When he tells Captain Smith he wants to be a detective, a revealing exchange occurs.  Smith: ""Would you shoot a guilty man in the back to keep a jury from acquitting him?""  Exley: ""No.""  Smith: ""Would you plant evidence on a man you knew was guilty to keep him from walking?""  Exley: ""No.""  Smith: ""Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.""  And Exley is as competent as he is honest, which we learn during a brilliant interrogation scene.  But he is also overweeningly ambitious, and it becomes increasingly unclear whether, or how much, his actions are motivated by his principles or by his desire to get ahead.  At the end, it appears that he has made a final choice between his career and his moral values . . . but he's fooled us, and his character remains tantalizingly ambiguous.  Like Crowe, Pearce is Australian, but not even the slightest hint of an Aussie twang ever passes his lips; he is utterly convincing playing an American.Russell Crowe was unjustly passed over by the Academy, failing even to garner a nomination for his wonderful performance as Bud White.  White is a hard and violent man, for whom justice is everything, and let the law go screw itself.  At times he appears simply to be a thug, as he calmly beats a tied and helpless suspect black and blue as if it were just another day at the office.  At others, he is a virtual white knight, risking both his life and his professional career to rescue women who are being beaten by abusive husbands or pimps (and to administer harsh street justice to their abusers). And some of his actions are in between.  Crowe delivers White's lines in a terse monotone, always suggesting tension underneath.  He does most of his acting with his face and hands; the sharp spasmodic nods and the puckering of his brow always hinting at violence kept under tight control.  When he does lose control, he is terrifying, like a raw amoral force of nature. While some will automatically condemn White with the happy homily, ""We mustn't take the law into our own hands,"" other viewers will admire him for his willingness to take responsibility for his own actions rather than hiding behind ""the law"" or ""the system"" which ultimately consists of people no better than he.Then there is Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a man who no longer takes either the law or justice seriously, and is now the technical advisor to the trash show ""Hush Hush"" first and a cop second.  However, as the movie progresses, we can tell that he is becoming bored and dissatisfied with his life.  He's forgotten why he joined the force, but he would like to remember.  ""I doubt you've ever taken a stupid breath,"" Cap. Smith tells Vincennes, and we agree, but we also sense that he's taken damn few happy ones.  Spacey's acting just keeps getting better.  In most of his scenes, it's hard to believe that he's reciting scripted lines; he looks and sounds exactly as if he is making words up on the spot, just like people do in real life.So given these three magnificently drawn characters, rendered by three outstanding actors, why is my IMDb vote for this movie only an 8 rather than a 10?  Because of the plot.  The same movie with the same story could have been made with three completely different characters, and still been believable.  It's not that the story is actually bad; it's one of the most complex mysteries since THE BIG SLEEP, fairly original, and some of the plot twists are downright shocking.  But it fails to give us the sense that ""character is destiny"" as the truly great dramas do; the same things could have happened to anybody else.  L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is ultimately a routine detective movie that happens to have some of the best acting and characterization ever seen on the silver screen.As a side note, I believe L.A. CONFIDENTIAL was very poorly served by its marketing.  The trailer, posters and title all suggest a trashy and lurid movie, told entirely from the perspective of Sid Hudgeons, Danny DeVito's sleazemongering tabloid king.  There wasn't a hint of the gem that was inside.  That's why I ended up seeing it on video, instead of in the theater as it deserved.Rating: *** out of ****.",L.A. Confidential

The film follows the classical style of film-making to perfection.The actors are all in top form. The story remains strong for the entire duration. The cinematography is carefully thought-out. The plot and twists, as well as the climax are all well crafted. At times, quite gripping. One low point was the very last scene. It seemed to be added on and quickly shot. Kim Bassinger was the perfect call girl. Danny Devito was the clichéd Hollywood journalist, played exact. Kevin Spacey, as always steals the scene. Crowe was the perfect angry guy with a good heart. Guy Pearce, with his nerdy goodlooks upstages them all.The film takes us back to a time when Hollywood was mainly caucasian and the racism that came with it. It takes us back to a time when conservative tough white guys made the laws.

But although I liked some old film noir, nothing in this movie appealed to me except making fun of what is seemed so ""glamorous"" about these places in California. Especially at the end, it goes from bearable to horrible. It turns into one of those movies where everyone dies instantly from one gunshot except the main characters who get shot multiple times and take forever to die, if they do at all. Suddenly someone has to satirize the satire.",L.A. Confidential
230,Manthorpe,An instant classic.,10,2 February 2004,"L.A. Confidential has one of the best screenplay's ever written, which is complimented by excellent castingwhich produced some top-notch performances from some virtual unknowns at the time. Guy Pearce, Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell were all perfectly cast for this film. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role, although some of her fellow cast members were more deserving of an award. Had the Hype-tanic not been released the same year, this film would have completely swept the Oscars. Damn undeserving Titanic. Oh well. That just goes to show that the Academy doesn't necessarily reflect respect where it's deserved. Even though this film scored a few, the Titanic swept the 1997 awards, including Best Picture. My heart will go onNO!Even without the compliment of an A-grade screenplay, the acting performances are truly worth recognition. This was the first movie I had the pleasure of watching Guy Pearce in and I was blown away. He really seems to fit his part in this film and you really feel the emotions that the other characters have towards him. Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey also fit right in and provide excellent performances. Spacey easily pulls off being the smart ass showboat, and Crowe is very convincing as the reactionary, muscle-bound ""bad"" cop. James Cromwell also plays the chief of detectives flawlessly. And although Kim Basinger won Best Supporting Actress, I must assume that her competition was laughable at best. She plays a hooker, wow. Not that she didn't do it well, I just didn't feel it was all that deserving of an Oscar. I mean, how hard is it to play a tramp? But that's not her fault, or anyone else's involved in the picture....and it certainly doesn't take away from anything here.Curtis Hanson really shows everyone how it's done with this one, pulling off truly masterful directing techniques in every aspect. There isn't any area where I feel he could have improved. Everything flows perfectly and evenly, and the moods and pace are controlled very well. The general noir feeling he was going for was done nothing short of impeccable. The story itself is extremely entertaining and has a great ending, but I won't comment on that....you can see for yourself. I will simply say that the story is one of the best I've come across in a long time. Overall, simply perfect in every way and will easily become a classic.Definitely a great addition to anyone's collection. 10/10",L.A. Confidential
231,Stibbert,"Good, thrilling and with action on many levels",7,28 October 2005,"Los Angeles in the 1950's. A classic crime story. Three LAPD detectives does their own investigations of a mass murder at a diner. Turns out it all runs deeper than at first sight. This is a classic film-noir kind of crime story. It has the elements, but a bit different wrapping. A good wrapping that is and a good story.The script is good. You have one main character, Exley, and two other part main characters Vincennes and White. There are no pointed out villain, witch sets your own mind to work, trying to figure out who the bad guy is. You get to know all three characters. You get their background and you realize why they act like they do. There are a lot of work put down in all the characters and they all work well independently, but the chemistry between them is great! The story and plot is also good. It may be a little complicated at times, but nothing you can't handle. There are always something happening and the story is always twisting. It keeps you on your toes at all times.The actors are great. There are some arsenal they've got and they use it wisely. Kevin Spacey does a really good cool, classic, Hollywood-style cop and Guy Pearce is great as the 2nd generation by-the-book-cop. Russell Crowe delivers and so does James Cromwell while Kim Basinger makes a elegant femme-fatal. Danny DeVito, you know, is Danny DeVito.Jerry Goldsmith did it for Chinatown and does it again for this one. The score is great. It sets the mood and the era and builds up the action just as it should. It's cool and classic detective style. Much the same style as in Chinatown.The cinematography is nice. The lightening and composition is good and it captures the mood very well. The decorations, sets and costumes are really 50's style and good looking. The over all look of the film is just very good.L.A. Confidential is a nice film-noir style of movie, yet it is so in it's own way. It does things it's own ways and don't end up being a bad copy. It's a good movie with a strong story. You'll most likely find this to be a very good and thrilling film with action on many levels. Recommended.",L.A. Confidential
232,Daniel Karlsson,Typical Hollywood,4,27 September 2002,"I think this movie deserves at least one negative comment. This movie is so much Hollywood, it follows the template just fine. It's predictable; during the action scenes it's easy to tell who's going to survive, who's going to get a scratch, and who's going to fall. I have seen it before and it seems like I have to see it again. The script and acting during the first hour is not realistic, but standard Hollywood; so common everybody else finds it natural.

The strength of the movie isn't it's plot but the actors who build the characters throughout the plot - a fame-hungry cop(Spacey), a reckless but righteous cop(Crowe), a political but upright cop(Pearce) and others who represent a slick, corrupt system. The movie takes off after it has progressed to almost 75% of it's length so you gotta be patient. The plot has aplenty loose ends which make it seem illogical and predictive. The director seems to have rushed to wind-up the movie after stretching it a bit farther than required. The background score is average.

237,rhefner2002,Holds up well after 22 years,9,12 October 2019,"This film was the big sensation of 1997. Re-watching it 22 years later with more of a jaundiced eye, I have to say that it still holds up pretty well._LA Confiedntial_ replicates 50's noir cinema successfully, except that it's in color (but it's very 50's looking color, a nice detail), and it includes the requisite 90's nudity, profanity, and violence that was forbidden in those movies. A lot of the dialogue sounds like it came from a 50's _Dragnet_ episode, but that's appropriate.The performances by Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Danny DeVito, and James Cromwell, as well as most of the supporting cast, are convincing. I'm leaving out Kim Basinger, who plays a blonde bimbo (every 50's noir movie has to have one) who is not greatly integral to the story, just there for sex appeal. Let's face it: She didn't get famous because of her brilliant acting.I can't help but wonder if, in the 50's, all cops beat witnesses and suspects and stuck pistols in their mouths to get information. I'm sure it happened at times, but in this film, it's the norm. Hollywood embellishment, perhaps. I haven't read James Ellroy's novel, so I can't really say. But bad guys are bad guys, and it's fun to watch them get their asses kicked.The multiple plots intertwine without confusing the viewer, and they come together nicely.The entire agenda of the film is about exploring the sleaze, political corruption, and immorality that lies beneath the superficiality and glamour of L.A. That is exactly what noir writers like Chandler, Hammett and others were all about. In various ways, this film pays respect to them all.With all of its affectations, this film is like watching a cartoon. But a damn good one.",L.A. Confidential
238,mgtbltp,Close but no fedora,8,14 January 2013,"I discovered James Ellroy's L.A. Quartet series of novels, The Black Dahlia (1987), The Big Nowhere (1988), L.A. Confidential (1990), and White Jazz (1992) while living in Montana after a sort of cold turkey I experienced when I had devoured all of the Dashiell Hammett's, James M. Cain's, Ross MacDonald's, and Raymond Chandler's I could at that time get my hands on. They were all great reads, but unfortunately, this was before I really began to appreciate Film Noir and get a stylistic visual from those series of films of the world Ellroy was depicting. Of course I had seen ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""The Big Sleep"", ""Double Indemnity"" and ""Murder My Sweet"" but they were made before the neo- realistic phase of the Noir series so they didn't really count. L.A. Confidential according to Curtis Hanson was an attempt to depict '50's LA but not in a stylistically noir way, ""no long shadows"" so they consciously decided to show the '50's looking forward towards the future rather than highlight Film Noir. He needn't have bothered, the widescreen alone effectively negates the claustrophobic noir stylistic. Noirs were mostly about urban alienation and obsession, the majority of urban topography is vertical which suited the 3:4 aspect ratio well. But, what L..A Confidential does is incorporate Los Angeles' overall elongated horizontal urban structure into an effective neo noir. A plus is that the film even incorporates more actual 50's LA locations and interiors than for example the film Chinatown (story line circa 1930's) did, though this could be for the simple fact that way less 30's LA was still extant in 1973 than 50's LA in 1996. What locations they didn't have they reconstructed and the blend is seamless. The film looks that good.whats not to like:However one glaring WTF omission is what I like to call the ""romance of the fedora"" aside from the DeVitos' character Sid Hudgens and James Cromwell's Dudley Smith, fedoras are absent, missing in action. It just doesn't feel quite right, it would be sort of on par with making a Western without cowboy hats, the characters look naked. -1OK I can understand somewhat where Hanson is coming from in a commentary he states that he wanted to make a film that didn't feel like a period piece because he was concerned about getting funding, but you could at least have had 1/4 of the cast wear fedoras and one of the leads. The Author James Ellroy on his commentary on the DVD for Crime Wave ""Sterling Hayden-- That is my Bud White. That is my Bud White! ""F"" Russell Crowe in 'L A Confidential.' I mean he was okay, but he's a shrimpy little sh-t Bud White as Bud Whites go. Sterling Hayden is the real deal. Look at this! He's not even acting. Look at that hat!"" 'nuff said.""The Lynn Bracken/Bud White romance wasn't all that convincing didn't seem to be any chemistry there it needed more time to get fleshed out at least.If this film really wanted to be a neo noir masterpiece it didn't have confidence or the nerve to push that envelope, Hanson's reluctance to embrace Noir and go with the safe money gives us at the denouement the happy Hollywood ending. The bad guys are all dead and 2/3 of the good guys live. -1 final score 8/10",L.A. Confidential
239,MadReviewer,"Film Noir Revisited -- And Man, Is It Sweet, Daddy-O",9,6 August 2001,"Film noir is a style that's usually difficult to pull off.  Invariably, any movie done in the film noir style features flawed characters that are frequently unlikable; shadowy crosses, double-crosses, and triple-crosses that can make the story difficult to follow; and an unhappy ending that ultimately seems unsatisfying.  ""L.A. Confidential"", which can only be defined as a film noir mystery, meets all of the required criteria above . .. and yet it's still one hell of a compelling, fascinating movie.  ""L.A. Confidential"" takes a lot of difficult material and blends it all together seamlessly.  For that alone, the film should be noteworthy; the fact that the story is outstanding and the acting is exceptional pushes ""L.A. Confidential"" into the realms of the truly great.""L. A. Confidential"" is a gritty, stylish film patterned after the mysteries and crime drama films of the 1940s and 1950s, particularly those of Humphrey Bogart and Alan Ladd. Containing a dizzying number of plots, subplots, and enough red herrings to choke a horse, the storylines and characters are slowly woven together to create one single dark and beautiful film.  It begins with some gruesome killings -- which are dubbed by the press as ""The Nite Owl Murders"" -- and Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), a no-nonsense police detective, is assigned to the case. Ed's reluctant partner is flashy Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a vain cop who sees himself more as part of the entertainment business than the police force.  After some questionably ethical police work, Vincennes believes that he has wrapped up murders, but Detective Bud White (Russell Crowe) -- a cop usually better known for his fists than for his sleuthing ability -- discovers that there may be more to the ""Nite Owl Murders"" than meets the eye, and may involve some of L.A.'s highest ranking officials.  As the case truly begins to unravel, it becomes obvious that only the unlikely teaming of White, Exley and Vincennes can hope to ever discover the truth about what really happened.Based on the James Ellroy novel of the same name, ""L.A. Confidential"" perfectly captures the look and feel of the sweaty, sleazy underbelly of 1950s Los Angeles.  Mirroring the events of the film, everything on screen has a slightly dirty look to it, as if nothing can be entirely clean or free of guilt.  Even the language used is perfect -- the presence of the character Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) really brings to the forefront a distinct Fifties-ish feel to things with his weekly gossip column, where everything is `on the Q-T and strictly hush-hush'.  And the stories themselves are marvelous as well, each starting out from an isolated spot in the film, but eventually winding and coiling together to form one single powerhouse of a plot.  Some of the machinations by which these stories and plot wrap together seem slightly forced; but for the most part, it's pulled off so masterfully that these minor blemishes really don't matter.
Director Curtis Hanson does a terrific job of evoking the film noir feel without seeming like he's just mindlessly copying it.  The deliberate pacing of the film, the way certain shots are framed in shadow, the manner in which ominous events are foretold . . . everything helps to add to the story one way or another; there's precious little that seems like a waste of time or takes away from the film.  Equally impressive is just how the film is pieced together - there's a lot of stories and even more information for the audience to digest in `L.A. Confidential'. However, it's all laid out in a sequence that's relatively simple to understand; Hanson also knows where to let the characters tell the story, and where to let the actual visuals of the film tell the story.  `L.A. Confidential' is a film that easily could've been little more than a convoluted mess in other hands; in Curtis Hanson's hands, though, it's a gem of a film.And the acting . . . wow, where to begin?  (With the main characters, I suppose . . .) Kevin Spacey is great as Jack Vincennes, the cynical cop ""on the take"" who does a terrific job of letting the world know how much he doesn't give a damn about anything . . . but when push comes to shove, he reluctantly cares about a lot, perhaps even too much. Not many actors could pull off the part of Vincennes, but Kevin Spacey makes it look easy. Russell Crowe is equally great as detective Bud White, who for much of the movie is little more than a pit bull in human form.  However, Bud proves to be far more dangerous when he actually starts combining his mind with his muscle. Finally, Guy Pearce complements the other main characters in grand style as the arrogant, self-righteous, by-the-book Lieutenant Ed Exley. It's a nice touch in the film that he only starts to become likeable -- and a better cop -- when he starts bending the rules and becoming more unethical in his approach to policework; it's also interesting to notice that as he becomes less and less moral, Vincennes and White start becoming more and more moral. Exley's a little more subtle than the other two main characters, but he's equally as good as they are, and Guy Pearce deserves a lot of credit for his work in this film.Even the minor characters are great; however, the most impressive minor character is James Cromwell as Captain Dudley Smith.  This man is EVIL. Ruthless and cold, Cromwell effortlessly turns in a tour du force performance as a despicable, cold-hearted villain.  I'll admit I was shocked to see him pull off the role so well; I had a mental picture of Mr. Cromwell as the gentle farmer in ""Babe"" before watching ""L.A. Confidential"". . . . wow.  James Cromwell definitely has incredible talent and range.`L.A. Confidential' has a distinct dark side to it; it's certainly not a film for everyone.  It is, however, an undeniably sharp, clever, and stylish film, one that won't easily be forgotten . . . and will probably demand being watched more than once.  One of the best films of 1997.

Great Police Movie held in 1950!,8,27 April 2007,"In this movie I felt the total pleasure and delight of a magnificent script!, it is great how you can combine action, thrilling and unsolved police cases into this great movie!. Also with great actors that perform their roles extraordinary! The Oscar nominations and winnings of this movie are absolutely well earned! The story at some parts is somewhat complex, but the result is well obtained finally! Kim Bassinger acting is superb!, but the ones that i liked most where Rusell Crowe and Guy Pierce, they are Aussies (Guy was born in Englad but lived in Australia since he was 5) and still their accent is totally American. This detective movie resemble in a good way the time where corruption, mafia and illegal traffic was a total challenge for any good police officer. The great cinematography brought back those years in a very realistic way.About the Film: The story is placed on the 1950's, where mafia boss Mickey Cohen was imprisoned (the news appeared in Hush Hush, a newspaper managed by Sid Hudgens (Danny De Vito)); in the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department) leaded by Captain Dudley (James Cromwell) the police force then occupies of fewer things, but the city was still on a critical moment,some prostitution cases where on course of action, in one of them, Pierce Patchett (David Stratchairn) a rich person from LA owned one where womens where dressed and made look like famous actresses of the time, one of them was Lynn Bracken (Kim Bassinger). Meanwile three police officers of LAPD have to work together when a case of homicide in which a lot of people died at a restaurant, (included a police officer); these three cops are: (1) The tough police officer Bud White (Rusell Crowe), (2) the rookie and spiteful Edmund Jennings (Guy Pearce) who was hated by all in the department and (3) the Sgt Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) who loved cameras and was very conceited working as assessor for a TV Series; they truly have to stick to each other in order to solve an intriguing puzzle! 8/10 and one thumb up for Curtis Hanson.",L.A.

241,Laitue_Gonflable,"Stylish, intricate thriller is a winner in so many ways",8,26 September 2003,"I'd heard great things about L.A. Confidential without having heard anything about what it was. So naturally, going in, expectations were extremely high, as was the potential for disappointment. But was that potential ever groundless.The film is essentially escapism, so I shouldn't have expected such great things from it, but it really is escapism of the very highest calibre. It's complex but not confusing, suspenseful, sexy and very, very entertaining. Spacey, Crowe and Pearce are all at the peak of their game as three Los Angeles police officers all playing by different rules - one a smart, college-educated law-follower, one a tough and brutal 'bad cop', and one a media whore who works as an insider for a magazine journalist.It scores points on every level. From the fairly hammy comments on corruption in the system, to the tense and fast-paced action sequences, it entertains. It delivers what it promises and it leaves you feeling great.I won't go on for much longer, but I can honestly say that this is not a film that will disappoint, as long as you don't expect a masterpiece. It's just a very solid, well-made and thoroughly enjoyable flick. ****1/2 / *****",L.A. Confidential
242,Pamsanalyst,It's in the writing,10,5 August 2005,"Reading the comments, I find few viewers seemed to have read James Ellroy's LA Trilogy, on which LA Confidential is based. The Big Nowhere, LA Confidential and White Jazz comprise the Dudley Smith story; Smith is the only constant in all three. None of the heroes are in Nowhere, Buzz Meeks being gunned down by Dudley while trying to escape, having hidden the heroin. Buzz White survives Confidential along with Exley, and White does go off to Arizona, but Smith still lives and rides high. In Jazz, Ed Exley~~Guy Pearce~~and Smith do battle for the soul of David Klein, who in the end brings down Smith. Of the three, Confidential is surely the most complicated since with the heroin out there somewhere, many more players are involved.Hanson's genius is to shorten the story, eliminating Nowhere entirely, and bringing Dudley his retribution without Dave Klein being involved. He eliminates so many back stories: Exley's father is alive in the book, and a powerful politico to boot and this is just one difference, but in clarifying and making the story shorter, he almost makes it better. The murder of Vincennes is a brilliant touch, along with the code name Rollo Tomassi.Both the books and the film are pulse pounders, intense to the core. My late wife, who could never sit through any film without getting up for a cigarette, was immobilized, and by the end was screaming ""Kill him"" as Exley watched Smith depart. If I had one slight criticism, it would be the cleaning up of some of the language about the original suspects in the Nite Owl killings, but make no mistake about it, this is the film for the 90's, and the only 1997 Oscar nominee worth watching.

And he speaks of life and world being sometimes so beautiful, that he feels he can't take it. I get that feeling with watching L.A. Confidential. This is a beautiful movie. It really takes you to the 50's and gives you a warm feeling of film noir. I have to admit never reading the book, but actually that takes me to a better position to rate this film as a film and not a book adaptation. And it works. My god, how it works. The characters are so far from being boring, that you'd be thrilled if they actually could jump from the screen to real life.. hell, even the bad guys. Curtis Hanson finally showed us his real potential as a filmmaker, after the likes of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and The River Wild. Those films were not bad (actually quite good), but in the end they were just ordinary thrillers. L.A. Confidential explores deeper. The plot is not one-dimensional and I really didn't see the twists coming a mile away. Throughout the film, every character is perfectly cast and they all should have been up for Oscars.

Some didn't like Kim Basinger, but I think she was ideal for the part that she played. The theme of police corruption - those who are supposed to be the good guys but aren't - is a good setting for viewer involvement ...hint to budding scriptwriters out there.

245,jerry_dean67,Outstanding!,10,14 October 2000,This is one fabulous movie. The acting is top notch. The story draws you in and and keeps you interested until the end. The look and feel of the movie is straight out of L.A. in the 50's. I could add so much more to this movie but I will not. Just read most of the reviews listed for this movie and you will get the impression of what your in for. I will rate this movie a 10! Fabulous entertainment!,L.A. Confidential
246,johnmschofield,A very good film which doesn't quite hit the maximum,9,1 November 2009,"I like this film and I watch the DVD infrequently. I know how good it is and for once I am not entirely sure why it works which for somebody who has not seen it is not very helpful but suffice to say it is enjoyable to watch. All those involved in the making of this film deserve a collective pat on the back for producing a very good and entertaining piece of work. I cannot give it full marks though because no matter how many times I watch it there is something in the film which doesn't add up and so far I have not been able to suss out what it is. Maybe its just me who is looking for something which just isn't there, but its just slightly annoying not being able to enunciate what the missing thing is. Anyway whatever it is apart, this film requires your attention because the subtleties are numerous and the interactions are superb at times. It seems there is a lot of hype surrounding this film and I would suggest anyone who has not seen it just watch the film and do not pay attention to any of it good or bad. Like I say it is an enjoyable film and well worth watching.",L.A. Confidential
247,NORDIC-2,"Freud, Karpman, and the Modernist Aesthetic",9,8 December 2018,"I just watched 'L.A. Confidential' again, after a long hiatus. It still holds up as an expertly crafted and vastly entertaining (though ultra-violent) neo-noir. This time around I was struck by the thought that 'L.A. Confidential' is a kind of classic Freudian psychomachia, with its three principal characters - Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), and Bud White (Russell Crowe) - embodying the three parts of the human psyche, as outlined by Freud a century ago. Jack, a suave operator and publicity hound, is clearly the Ego. Ed, who is educated, cerebral, prudish, and ethical, is very much the Superego. Bud, who is full of pain, rage, and lust, is all Id. A conservative critique of the American celebrity culture of narcissism just beginning to emerge in the early 1950s, the movie depicts Jack Vincennes as cynical, venal, and corrupt-at least until he has a change of heart and casts his lot with Exley in a crusade against an evil Establishment. Jack's death (murdered by corrupt LAPD Capt. Dudley Smith) two-thirds of the way through the picture allegorically signals the falling away of selfish egotism just as the late-stage alliance of Ed (the Official Hero) and Bud (the Outlaw Hero) signals psychological resolution for both characters, who then converge into one powerful force for Good (Ed overcomes his emotional and psychological rigidities and Bud overcomes his rage and grief as both men commit to battle a common enemy). There's a social class allegory here, as well. Ed embodies bourgeois ambition while Bud embodies working-class angst and despair. Their coming together figures for a uniting of the professional managerial class (PMC) and the working-class against a corrupt ruling elite: an unlikely occurrence in real life but deeply satisfying as a cinematic imaginary. One could also invoke Karpman's Drama Triangle here, especially in regards to the Bud White character. Victimized by his brutal father, who murdered his mother, Bud has become a perennial persecutor of woman-abusers and rescuer of woman-victims: an obsession that keeps him immersed in self-consuming melodrama until he turns his attention to a different kind of evil, i.e., the corrupt alliance between Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) and the city's heroin peddling gangsters.",L.A. Confidential
248,El Guapo-2,The point of noir is that there are no innocents,10,3 November 2005,"The ""limp-wristed"" character of Matt Reynolds is supposed to be Tab Hunter, who was outed by the tabloid press in 1955. The spin with this movie is that Paul Guilfoyle (II), is the son of Paul Guilfoyle, the veteran character actor who got Tab Hunter his big break, so to speak. The Television show is obviously supposed to be Dragnet. It's all an illusion, as we are to learn, because of the vast level of corruption of the city and the cities forces. The movie is supposed to be taking place in the past but its also simultaneously taking place in the present as there are actors and lights and cameras, and such. This is what took place when they made the movie in the late '90s, as they told a story of something that happened in the '50s and is still happening.Russell Crowe gave a standout performance and dominates the movie. Everyone roots for him for the most, I suspect. He is really is proving that he understands acting as reaching a psychological archetype of that character. The best actors are coming out of Australia, and I find that interesting, as it indicates a shift of some sorts in film-making. Film-making is getting more and more self-referential. You can't get any more self-referential than this film, because of the Paul Guilfoyle connection. It's right there to read into to, and I think it's a daring thing for a major motion picture to do. This film will continue to have a long afterlife.",L.A. Confidential

Then I was depressed that a movie was being made, because I knew it wouldn't even come close to the epic novel. Yeah...yeah... I know, don't say it. ""The book is always better than the movie."" Well then, forget the movie and read the book! I sat dumbfounded watching this movie trying to figure if the characters on the screen were supposed to be the same ones  adapted from the book. The ONLY character who even remotely the same was Ed Exley played by Russell Crowe, and any similarity between Jack Vinsenze in print and on film is purely coincidental. The only people who think that this movie is any good, are those that haven't read the book. Take my advice boys and girls, read the book, you'll have no desire to watch this film ever again.",L.A.

It's entertaining with lots of action and the usual necessary plot twists. Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey deliver outstanding performances well suited to their acting personas. As do Guy Pearce (Ed Exley) and James Cromwell (Captain Dudley Smith). The movie starts off slow and threatens to become just a glamorous 'film noire.' However, make it through the first hour and the plot develops well with plenty of action to keep one interested. (Yes, it's a long movie with a running time of two hours and twenty minutes!)Through a well crafted plot the film touches upon racism, corruption, politics and even gender issues. Characters develop well along with the plot; none can be judged on first impressions. If for no other reason, the movie is watchable simply for the shootout scene which comes late in the film. A masterful piece of filmwork to rival the best of spaghetti Westerns! A good film which has aged well. A special treat for detective film fans.",L.A. Confidential

He doesn't remember why he became a cop.  These three very different cops come together to investigate a shotgun murdering.LA Confidential has some great acting from some very good actors.  All the main leads pull off their parts well as do most of the supporting cast. This has maybe the best plot for a Hollywood film in some time, and it is based on a book by James Ellroy.  The characters are very well thought through, and their feelings are very well portrayed.  The only slight problem with this film is that it is occasionally boring, but not too often.

257,Aomalle27,Perhaps the definitive film of the nineties,10,25 April 2008,"Another nice nostalgia, police procedural flick of the nineties. This one stars (at the time) little known Aussie actors Guy Pearce and Russel Crowe, alongside accomplished character actors Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger and Danny Devito. It's a crime drama in the mold of Kiss of Death, I wake up screaming, or the Big Sleep. Some gritty underworld figures are slowly being eliminated, their are new cops on the beat in Los Angeles, the Department seeks a new reputation as a friendlier organization, but the seedier sides of the city are tearing away at that fragile facade. Some of L.A.'s finest are ca-noodling with high priced hookers cut to look like the famous starlets of the day (Veronica Lake to name but one), others are in bed (figuratively with the local gossip rag), but despite all the flaws of the three main police officers involved in the main course of the movie, they all share a desire to break free of their less than savory ways and become honestly decent cops. The mystery of the film revolves around a shooting at a Hollywood diner, that once delved into, becomes a complex maze of who's who in the criminal world. The difference between right and wrong, good and bad is severely tested, and more than a few won't survive. If you've never viewed a forties style gangster flick, or police procedural, check out this film for a taste of what they were like.",L.A. Confidential
258,frank-liesenborgs,Masterpiece is an understatement,10,21 February 2016,"L.A. Confidential is three movies in one. Every time you watch it, you enjoy it more and more. And the third time you can only give it the maximum 10/10 quote on IMDb. The acting is phenomenal. Don't forget that Russell Crowe was not nominated for an Oscar but in 2001 got one for ""Gladiator"", Best Actor in a Leading Role and nominated for 2 more (""The insider"" and ""A beautiful mind""). One year earlier Kevin Spacey won his Oscar (Best Actor in a Supporting Role) in ""The Usual Suspects"", another favorite movie of mine and also Top Rated. In this movie he was also not nominated. But in 2000 took the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role in ""American Beauty"". And the same applies to Guy Pearce who also outperformed in L.A. Confidential and also not nominated. But with ""Memento"", another Top Rated movie (again one of my all-time favorite movies) got 2 Oscars (or at least the Nolan Brothers). So we have a top cast with actors who already made it, or who made it a bit later and shined so bright here that you'd have to have wear sunglasses to watch the movie. Another example, Simon Baker, who plays Matt Reynolds. The scene where Vincennes meets with Sid Hudgens to arrange a sexual encounter with Matt Reynolds takes only 2 minutes. But you can see that Simon Baker has all it takes to become a great actor (and featured in ""The mentalist"" later – not to compare with this movie, but strictly seen from an acting point of view). These are just four great actors but it's the whole cast. To my humble opinion all of them outperformed, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, Paul Guilfoyle and so on. Combine this with a plot that's unbeatable, perfect directing (Curtis Hanson – ""Bad Influence"", ""Too big to fail"" etc) and you have an explosive combination that can only lead to a true masterpiece.Try to find something negative about this movie (apart from the fact that it missed out on the Oscars) and let me know. If you can, I'll buy you a bottle of Champagne, Dom Pérignon from 1952 – 1953, the year of L.A. Confidential and the year of the best Champagnes from DP.",L.A. Confidential

261,MackMonMay87,Hard-Boiled 50's Detective Drama a Tough but Relevant Watch Today,7,22 August 2020,"LA Confidential oozes with the 50s style it's going for. Every aspect of the production from the costumes, the sets, cars, music, and dialogue is spot-on for the era, and in no way feels like actors from the 90s playing for a bygone time period.This is a far superior, more historically honest production as opposed to movies like 2013's ""Gangster Squad"" that had a racially diverse, politically correct depiction of a similar era, or the revisionist history remake of The Magnificent Seven (to go further back). The racism, sexism, and bigotry of the 50s are on full display in LA Confidential, and the film isn't even always apologetic about it. Your mileage may vary on how much the depiction of this kind of content affects you. As time goes on, the American public seems to be more and more aware on average of police corruption, racial profiling, and unnecessary violence used by police departments, so a movie like LA Confidential, where these elements are shown as a harsh reality of the time period (not that they don't happen today) and a reality of police procedure, might be hard to watch.
I was impressed that the movie was so honest about this content, it's more or less always been a part of the police system, even when criminals are successfully dealt with. The politics and power-plays shown in police departments are what elevates this over a typical shoot 'em up thriller.
The entire cast is excellent, especially vintage Russell Crowe in his prime, even pre-Gladiator, who's an ass-kicking force of nature as hard nosed detective Bud White.
LA Confidential impressed me a lot, but it's held back by some scenes that stretch what's an otherwise very believable setting and premise. *Spoilers ahead*The scene where Guy Pearce and Russel Crowe's characters threaten and assault a sitting District Attorney to get information on the corruption case is over the top. There's dozens of witnesses on the street who can see he's being dangled above a sidewalk. Whether or not he confessed to collusion, he could always say his confession was given under duress, Exley and White would've never made it a step further in their investigation after that. Also, in the shootout at the end, White gets shot at least twice, maybe three times in the body, and once in the jaw, and is shown several scenes later alive and relatively well. He would have a tough time surviving that if that happened today, much less with the medical technology available then.Despite a few scenes that stretch beliveability in its otherwise gritty, down to Earth setting, LA Confidential is a solid watch for anyone who enjoys detective drama and action, dressed up in the glowing sheen of a vintage era of Hollywood history that gives refreshing contrast to the bloody, harsh underbelly of Los Angeles.",L.A.

That is probably the most brilliant aspect of this movie : it has a gigantic plot that is composed of about 5 or 6 clever subplots - all of which contribute to the movie.In fact, this movie is so extensive and rich in plot that it probably could have been a mini-series if it wanted to - not that I would have preferred that. I am just saying that to show that it is very deep and never boring. There's alot of substance to all the characters. They all have their individual stories going on. They all have an agenda. Best of all, they all have a reason for being in this brilliant movie. You just have to watch the movie closely, and you start to realize how that character that was of no significance earlier in the plot suddenly became really important - maybe only for about 5 minutes, but that's long enough.The cast is perfect for this movie.

The cast is terrific, particularly Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce. Curtis Hanson's direction is masterful as is his Oscar-winning script co-written by Brian Helgeland. The story, based on James Ellroy's novel is multi-layered and very engrossing, involving crime and corruption in 1950s L.A. This movie captures perfectly the look and mood of that time and place. From the opening scene to the very end, i sat there glued to the screen. I can't recall ever getting as lost in a film as I did with this one. I have watched it many times and it never gets tired.

265,dragonshield,How detective movies should be made,9,12 June 2007,"First of all, I wasn't expecting so much about this movie. It had a pretty high rating at IMDb and it's praised all over the place, but I just wasn't so interested of it. Well, it turned out to be an excellent movie. The movie tells a story happening in Los Angeles in the 1950's and it tells about a corruption occurring all over the police force and a committed murder, which three different polices start to investigate in their own unique ways. Ed Exley, the golden boy of the police force, smart and the one obeying the law. Bud White, a rough man ready to break the law to seek justice. Then there's Jack Vincennes, a celebrity detective being the one who does the job for publicity and press photos, but still managing something with his smart, yet somewhat crooked ways.There are two things about this movie which make it so magnificent; The storyline and the cast. The storyline is filled with excitement and it keeps on going all the way through. After the first hour the movie kind of stops a little bit and it seems like it starts to stumble, or that's at least what you think. There are these scenes which seem like irrelevant, but they eventually get important for the whole plot in a genius way. This movie is a perfect example of how to make a real crime/detective movie, there's the crime in the beginning and after that there's just this fantastic progression of the whole investigation from the very beginning till the very end, detectives finding interesting and also very surprising clues during the progress. Then there's the amazing cast; Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, David Strathairn, Danny DeVito.. Honestly, can you think of any better? Great indeed.This leads up myself to the acting the movie has to offer. The role performances are all in all fantastic. Ed Exley is played by Guy Pearce and I really haven't seen Pearce in a role like Exley before, but I am happy to say that he is great in it. Then there's the always superb Russell Crowe playing Bud White, the real bad ass cop. If someone can play a bad ass and look so furious it's Crowe without a doubt. He's just so frightening. Finally there is Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes and as I've watched more than a few Spacey movies recently I'm starting to like him more and more and he is starting to be one of my favourite actors. In this movie he still is as excellent as you can pretty much expect from him. Pearce, Crowe and Spacey shine with astonishing role performances and they are the best thing the cast has to offer. I'm not underestimating the rest of the cast at all though, as there is the fierce James Cromwell, the beautiful Kim Basinger, the somewhat charismatic and cool David Stathairn and then there's the tiny but incredible Danny DeVito, who I haven't really seen in a more fitting role and he does some damn fine job in it too. Cromwell is enjoyable as usual, Basinger does what she does best and Strathairn is the coolness itself, though in my opinion he was better in ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" Still a great achievement though.""L.A. Confidential"" offers you a great movie experience. It sets mark on how detective movies should be made and how the whole crime investigation process should be progressing. It's exciting and it's interesting, doing that all the way through. It includes fantastic role performances and brilliant characters which all in their vivid personalities will most certainly not disappoint the viewer. It doesn't get messy in any part so the viewer won't be missing anything and won't get lost, so the film is also easy for your eyes. Directed by Curtis Hanson who captures the real essence of 1950's through images and music and based on the novel by James Ellroy which is translated to a magnificent screenplay in the hands of Brian Helgeland and the director Hanson himself, it just doesn't go wrong. I'm recommending this movie to everyone; The pleasure was all mine when watching it and I hope it will be yours as well.",L.A. Confidential

Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Russell Crowe, and Kim Basinger...the film is a who's who of Oscar winners). ""L.A.

There were plot and character subtleties that were much easier to appreciate, without having to concentrate as much on what was going on (following the film noir guideline of having a complicated story line).  This movie successfully avoided stereotypical characters; each character had many motivations, some sympathetic, some not. Loved Kevin Spacey's performance (not unusual), and Guy Pearce was really good as Exley.

Every element has its exposition and its payoffs; and even good Lt. Auxley is unable to resist temptation in one scene.The movie is shot exquisitely c/o Dante Spinotti but minimalistically and without over-the-top visuals that you find in Depalma; all the players in the ensemble never fail including the seductive performance that earned Kim Basinger her Oscar; which surprisingly is devoid of overwrought and unnecessary hysterics that appeal to many nerds of ""heavy drama."" In the end there is a team-up with whom you will discover to be the 2 main characters of this drama; one of which indeed makes a choice that James Cromwell quizzes him about early on.

This a great film and one of the best crime story and should see anytime you get the chance.",L.A. Confidential
275,Hairy_Lime,Excellent Modern Noir,9,6 August 2006,"Well, I watched L.A. Confidential last night for the first time. An excellent example of modern film noir. A well written, brilliantly acted film. However, a couple of minor quibbles prevent me from giving this a 10, or calling it one of the great films of its time. First, I join in praising the acting; uniformly excellent. Usually, I don't care much for Russell Crowe, but here, why, it's almost like he was born to play an unintelligent mook prone to uncontrolled fits of violence. Second, I think it's Spacey's best work that I've seen, much better than his Oscar work in the vastly overrated Usual Suspects, for instance. And James Cromwell was superb. I'm only aware of seeing him in a handful of roles; he's been good in all of them, but his turn here was a revelation. The scene where he offs Spacey jarred me. Pearce, Straitharn, and even Basinger are also memorable.But I had a couple problems with the film, that at first blush at least keeps me from praising it too highly. First, I hated hated hated the times the director superimposed an earlier shot of a character over the screen, as if we were not smart enough to figure out that the dead girl was the prostitute with the nose job, for instance. A smart film like this one should trust the audience to get it. Second, you know, when a character asks another one, ""Would you shoot a suspect who is surrendering in the back to prevent some lawyer from getting him off?"" and the character answers ""No"", well, you pretty much know how the movie is going to end, don't you. There's a difference between foreshadowing and telegraphing. The movie does it a second time, too, when Spacey and Pearce are talking about how they got into police work and Pearce mentions the imaginary name he's given to the guy who killed his father, followed by a scene where Spacey whispers that name to Cromwell, followed by a scene where Cromwell asks Pearce - and only Pearce, mind you! - if he knew the guy. There is no reason for Cromwell to ask only Pearce about the guy, except to move the plot along to Pearce's recognizing that Cromwell is the villain. There were other, better, subtler ways to reach that conclusion, and the movie should have seized them. The ""rape"" scene didn't work for me at all. Not for a minute. Again, it seems an obvious plot contrivance. I think it would have worked better (given that the point of the scene was to allow photos to be taken) if Basinger had been the aggressor. Oh, and I am somewhat torn between praising the excellent cinematography and arguing the movie should have been in Black & White. Color photography diminishes noir, and neo-noir. And last, how did Bud White survive that final shoot-out? Didn't Cromwell shoot him in the face, point blank? What, is this some sort of mystical Jules and Vince moment? Movie ends better with him dead, I think. But still, great acting and dialog. The screenplay is intelligent and suspenseful; wonderfully shot, great music. That I still rate the film as highly as I do, with these problems, is a testament to how superb the rest of the film is.",L.A. Confidential
276,ashi-lance,L.A. Confidential (1997),9,25 August 2013,"People seem to feel the need to compare this remarkable film with the film noir genre as well as with the time honored classic Chinatown. Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... ""Go back to Jersey...""), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it.My Rating 9/10",L.A. Confidential

Basinger won Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.",L.A. Confidential
279,gevalero,An absolute knockout,10,11 January 2009,"Much can be said about the ""catching lighting in a bottle"" cast selection of this movie or its fantastic direction but LA CONFIDENTIAL's biggest merit is being the rarest of cases in which the most convoluted of the plots will have you confused and guessing 90% of the time but you'll still be enjoying it to 100% capacity. I've seen the film over a dozen times and every time I see it I realize something new (my level of the movie's understanding might be up to +/-95% by now). To think I wasn't interested in going to see this movie until word of mouth got me to ! Hard to believe there was somebody in Hollywood willing to take a chance on the unknown Australian actors for a major studio film's main roles but the results speak for themselves. One of the best movies of all time, period.",L.A. Confidential
280,geiri,No question...brilliant!!!,9,24 October 1998,"Well LA CONFIDENTIAL is a suspense tornado of lies and deceit that revolves around three very different police officer personalities. Officer Bud White is the brutish personality who doesn't feel he is very smart, so he forces the hand of whoever stands in his way. Sgt. Jack Vincennes is all Hollywood. Mr. Showbiz. He doesn't even dress like a police officer. Lastly, there's Sgt. Ed Exley, a clean cut college educated character looking for promotions. Exley understands the politics of police work in Los Angeles. I must say that L.A. Confidential is better than TITANIC(I think it is).If you haven't seen the film, and wonder, is it really that good, the answer is simply YES. This could be the best cop movie ever. Well written, well directed, well acted, and with cinematography and set designs that are simply spectacular.It is quite simply one of the best movies ever made forget Titanic. This is the best picture of the year! BELIEVE ME......",L.A. Confidential
281,DaveDiggler,Incredible Look; Incredible Plot,8,11 August 2008,"""L.A. Confidential"" is the kind of film that will make you laugh; make you gaze in amazement at its appeal, and become immersed in a murder mystery with so many twists and tangles that it could make your head spin. With one of the strongest plots I've ever seen, which is executed masterfully by Curtis Hanson, also has eye candy and sex appeal. The direction really is wonderful. The art direction is fantastic and brings you right back into the 50s. The acting is very good even if it comes off as 50s styled acting proving that todays actors are far superior than the actors of the 50s. ""L. A. Confidential"" even goes as far as poking fun at the sensationalized way films were made in that time period with a hilarious sequence where a cop on a show called, ""Badge of Honor,"" interrupts a women giving him details about some crime, and he says, ""Just the facts, ma'am. Just the facts.""The tangled and twisted plot is engrossing and filled with seduction, cons, lies, betrayal, killings, and corruption. The acting is terrific from a slew of great actors including Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Walter Cromwell plays one of the great villains I've ever seen. All of these guys have a lot of fun with their roles, and do an excellent job. Kim Basinger plays a prostitute who tries to look like a movie a star so that her pimp, Pierce Patchett (David Stratharin), can reap the benefits since everyone wants to be with a celebrity. ""L. A. Confidential"" is as much a look at the culture of the 50s, both commercially through television and the dirty business of police officers exposed, as it is being a stylized homage piece. This is a film that's done exceptionally well with some great lines, great performances, and a plot that will force you to watch it again and again. It hardly misses a beat. This is one of the few films that can recreate the 50s with its acting and style and still hold up with todays society. It works well as a film and exceptionally well as an homage piece.",L.A. Confidential

283,SonOfMoog,Not What It Seems,9,11 January 2007,"Nothing is what it seems, says the tagline for this movie. So, lets look at that for a moment. Some call this movie a film noir for the nineties, and with good reason. It's a story without any good guys, set in a 1950's world where crime and corruption are a way of life, with plenty of night scenes and scenes in the rain, so, aside from the fact that it's in color, it *looks* like a film noir.But, this movie doesn't have a femme fatale. Oh, it has a pretender for that title, but somewhere about two thirds of the way through this movie, Lynn Bracken, gorgeous and worldly but jaded hooker, played wonderfully by Kim Basinger, says this: Lynn Bracken: I see Bud because I want to. I see Bud because he can't hide the good inside of him. I see Bud because he treats me like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who *bleep* for money.No woman who sees the good inside a man can be a femme fatale, because a femme fatale never sees any good inside a man; they're only interested in the bad. So, forget this movie as a modern day film noir. It seems like one, but it is not what it seems.Nor is anything else in this movie what it seems. It's impossible to say more without spoiler warnings, because no matter what I say, the very act of talking about this movie gives away some of its surprises. But, let me say just a word about each of the characters.Lynn Bracken - we first see her as a high class, uncaring whore made to look like Veronica Lake, but by movie's end, she'll morph into someone we never expect.Bud White - we first see him as a brutal, sadistic, amoral cop, whose idea of justice is planting or faking evidence to insure the guilty are punished.Captain Dudley Smith - who says all the right things, and does all the wrong ones. Or is it the other way around? Ed Exley - smarmy, weaselly, facile, disingenuous cop on the make, trying to dig out from the legacy of his policeman father, killed in the line of duty. In a world of disgusting, unlikable people, I disliked him the most.Jack Vincennes - if Bud White is this movie's Mark Fuhrman, then Jack Vincennes is its Joseph Wambaugh: celebrity cop, consultant on a police television show that looks suspiciously like Dragnet, flashy dresser, who pays for his clothes and his extravagant lifestyle with money received from bribes.As the movie unfolds, each of the three cops is working on a particular case that is personally important. To solve that case, each of the three must help the others solve theirs in exchange for the support of the other two. In the end, and I hope I'm not spoiling too much by saying this, they learn as do we that they were all working on the same case.This is masterful storytelling, each plot-point slowly and inexorably linked to the others to form a cohesive, sordid world of corruption, manipulation, betrayal, graft and murder. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen, and Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell and Kim Basinger give the performances of their careers. A solid 9 out of 10.",L.A. Confidential

285,paul_tremblay,Every image counts...,8,29 September 1999,"L.A. Confidential is probably the American movie (of 1997) with the most perfect rhythm, the most polished finish, and is the motion picture which takes into account ALL the elements to render a true work of art. Every image counts, every piece of dialogue, background noise, is important: if you miss one of the above, you'll miss part of the experience of watching a film which stands alone as one piece, like a perfectly made jewel. I'm enthusiastic about this film. Part of the plot is predictable, the ending Hollywoodian, but you have to admire the craft, the artistry of the ensemble.",L.A. Confidential
286,Lunchbox-8,Possibly one of the best crime dramas ever made,10,7 June 2001,"LA Confidential is simply a great movie.  It yeilds an award winning cast, superb plot, great action, and masterful art direction.  By art direction I mean the way that the movie really does seem to take place in 1953.  The costumes and hairstyles, the car models and years, the intense Los Angeles background, etc.  It all comes out to make the movie have a great and unique image.  Many compare the image of LA Confidential to that of The Untouchables.  One major flaw: LA Confidential was a serious picture with great charcaters while Untouchables had those charcaters who had that whole comical image about them, like the bookman at the end, or Capone's cliched groupies who pretty much seemed like they came directly from an old Dick Tracy cartoon clip.  Besides the sincere and successful image, the plot is absolutely superb, nearly perfect.  It combines deep and confusing mystery with a great dramatic story of cops.  Besides the plot, the cast is great too.  Kevin Spacey, one of my favorite actors, functions very well as the fame hungry and funny cop Jack ""Big V"" Vincennes.  Guy Pearce, featured in the great thriller Memento, is a very good newcomer who plays the by the book Ed Exely.  Also, Russel Crowe is great as the violent but principled cop Wendell ""Bud"" White.  Altogether, LA Confidential is a great movie.  It is definitely one of the best movies made in the 90's and possibly the best ploce drama ever.",L.A. Confidential
287,avisheksahu-81273,Paparazzi Business is Movie Business!,8,20 June 2021,"Yeah, this movie does just that: it takes bread out of the hands of The Papparazi because it unrepentantly lays bare the murky world behind the tint of glamour. Stars work for us, and take a hit where it hurts, at least where it would hurt most of our judgemental audience, ever willing to draw joy out of their work and then pan them for their lifestyle aspired to and looked-down-upon at the same time. Hypocrisy doesn't exist in Hollywood, it just exists within the audience that is often too coy, or too lazy to acknowledge their deepest desires.",L.A. Confidential
288,dan_c99,An absolute ripoff of Chinatown,1,29 August 2014,"Better to watch Chinatown again than this overrated junk. The story was too contrived and needlessly complicated. Kim Basinger is no Faye Dunaway. The period music was applied with a trowel, and I never believed any of the characters was a real 'tough guy'. A bunch of Hollywood types pretending to be rough characters. And it never established a real period feel. By the way, having Danny Devito in this movie made it a total joke. We're supposed to take The Penguin seriously as a character in a major film? And his voice-over was a cliché, something I would expect in a satirical film.I'm mystified that so many people think this movie is great.",L.A. Confidential
289,Incendid,Seductive.,9,29 May 2015,"To Start, L.A. Confidential is a story about corruption, police brutality, trust and masculinity. The film follows three policemen who have different ways of solving cases. The first is Bud White played by Russell Crowe, who uses violence, the second is Ed Exley played by Guy Pearce who is diplomatic and runs to the point and thirdly we have Jack Vincennes played by Kevin Spacey, who is sleazy and likes to be in the spotlight. All three deliver great performances, however Vincennes character does begin to fade from the film during the second half. However Exley and Whitey both have completed character arcs and are well developed. After the fallout of an event at the start of the film, we can see the different paths Exley and White have taken however both seem to be on a collision course with each other, and as one of them gains a new piece of information, the other will go one step further. White's character is quite interesting, he has respect for women and protects them at all costs, not matter the consequences. To balance this, he is quite violent towards men, making his judgement somewhat clouded, Exley on the other hand believes in one thing and that is Justice, he is also the complete opposite to White, he uses his words before he uses his hands.The story is slow, but for a film just over two hours long, being slow is fine. The tone is well dark, and it provides irony, as L.A. in 1950's at least was advertised as the city where dreams come true and in L.A. Confidential we see the dark truth. For the most part the script is logical and lateral, however there are a few minor, and they really are minor, hiccups. For example,at a plot point in the film, a character gives another character an essential clue, however I found it silly that the former character who had been so careful up until this point would give away such an essential clue. Other than that the other problems are truly minor. Onto direction, Curtis Hanson manages to wrangle three worlds within one film, and to keep them separate would have been no easy task, and actually sustaining them would have been quite difficult indeed. The sets looked fantastic, they were all quite engrossing, which is always good. The costumes perfectly fit in with the time period and each character's costume was recognisable, and unlike Jurassic Park, the character's costumes were not Care-beared or in other words each character had a different coloured shirt. The cinematography was great and worked with the limitations of the film. Although the score was nominated for an Oscar, it just didn't fit for me.In conclusion, L.A. Confidential is a great film and definitely anybody who is a fan of crime dramas or mystery and detective films should watch. My rating: 9/10.",L.A. Confidential
290,seeingbystarlight,There's trouble in Paradise.,10,30 July 2018,"L.A. Confidential revolves around three cops:Officer Bud White (Russell Crowe) who, as a child saw his mother beaten to death, and has been trying to avenge her ever since, as well as engaging in some illegal activities he feels bad about but can't escape.Sargeant Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) who's father served on the Force before him, and was killed in the line of duty. Ed's dream is to measure up to his father, but his self-righteous naivete proves to be a serious drawback.And finally, to quote yellow journalism, Celebrity Crime Stopper Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), who, aside from his job, lives for being the technical advisor on Badge Of Honor (a popular television series which shows L.A cops ""walking on water as they keep the streets clean of crooks"").All three men have their differences, and none of them get along, until a shooting at a diner called The Night Owl drives them to ultimately join forces, as they dig deeper into a case which grows darker, and more treacherous the more they investigate it...And with the digging, come the other characters into the story.There's Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) who -by all appearances- is a pillar of integrity, but has secrets of his own to keep.There's D.A. Ellis Loew (Ron Rifkin), who has bad appetites to keep under wraps.And the wealthy Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn) who runs the very illicit Fleur De Lis: Whatever You Desire.Then, there's the beautiful Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) who belongs to a group of high class call girls cut to look like movie stars, and who steals the audience's heart away when, upon first seeing Bud White, immediately pegs him as a Police Officer.""Is it that obvious?"" Bud White asks.
""It's practically stamped on your forehead."" she replies.All of them are being watched like hawks by Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) a tabloid reporter who loves to uncover dirt, and has recruited Jack Vincennes to help him do it.I have not had the privilege of reading James Ellroy's novel but I can say without hesitating that this movie does it justice.Everything is impeccable, from the dialogue, to the settings, to the soundtrack.Kim Basinger deserves her Oscar. And these are great roles for the lead actors (especially Guy Pearce who stars in the best role I've ever seen him in).Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell add tremendously also, but it is Danny DeVito with his blithely amoral outlook on life who is the shining star of the supporting cast, kicking off one of the best opening scenes ever put into a movie, and adding levity to the story, as he digs relentlessly for the dirt...""Off the record.

The incredible thing about this movie is acting,seems like every actor is living the character they are in. Russel Crowe just stands out as the tough cop and a man who hates women beaters,rapers and killers.His voice tone through the entire movie helps building his character,the other great aspect as anti-political. Kevin Spacey ,what could i say ,he is just awesome,his turn as a likable and smart Sgt really gives the plot a go-ahead.Especially the scene where with James Crowell. Guy Pearce ,just nailed the character of Ed Exley.His transformation from a fame-lover and political smart officer to a real justice seeking man is very good. Kim Basinger ,she is just beautiful and clever.she doesn't look so aged and her charm and acting deserved the academy. Every other supporting actor Danny DeVito,James Cromwell and David Strathairn are all good.

293,sonicheze8,witty and snappy neo-noir,8,10 July 2019,"L.A Confidential has three main characters portrayed by, Guy Pierce, Russel Crowe and Kevin Spacey. An incredibly well-renounced cast, but during that time both Pierce and Crowe were relatively unknown.I found the movie to be smart and fun to watch. It respects it's audience. Having multiple main characters served the plot well, as the theme of corruption and good/bad could develop as the lines blur such as a noir would. Moreover, the plot felt tangled and loose, with seemingly unrelated plot events unfolding throughout the movie. This all comes together to give a sense of realism and novelty unseen in most crime movies.The characters are played wonderfully and are wonderful character studies themselves. Skillfully, they all serve as foils to one another. Contrasting each of their dominant traits. This allows the movie to explore their development with less time, which helps considering the multiple focuses the movie has to take.The standard twist is perhaps a little undeveloped. But it still comes as a surprise as little information is given in a short amount of time before the reveal two-thirds of the way through.A strong point of the movie is without a doubt how detailed everything is. It's a meticulously built world, with believable characters, and a tight recreation of an era. Crime, morality, characters, and beliefs intertwine magically in this movie.",L.A. Confidential
294,Doc-134,Justice Deconstructed,10,17 June 1999,"What is the meaning of the word 'justice'? This is a question that Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"" compels its audience to ask numerous times. The film, which is based on James Ellroy's novel offers two vastly differing views on the meaning of justice, explicated in the varying styles of police work that the characters perform. Each man represents a different and opposing discourse within the police department. There is much ""dialogic"" between each of the discourses. For example, the commander, Dudley says ""the department needs smart men (political men) like Exley and direct men like White"". The differences between these characters will be discussed later on. At first each discourse exists in its own realm, in terms of binary oppositions. But later on, the characters realize that they cannot do their jobs to the utmost of their ability when they are stuck solely in their own methodology of police work, and therefore the story begins to deconstruct the various binary oppositions.BUD WHITE (Russell Crowe) - White is an officer who is ready at any moment to break the rules, taking the law into his own hands to ensure that justice is served, however he is barely able to keep his raging violence under control. In fact, he adhere's to violence as a necessary adjunct to the job. He has no problem being called upon to do dirty work such as beating confessions out of criminals. White is man, whose driving force seems to be that of seeking revenge for his dead mother (killed by his father). One of the interesting things about him is that he never hesitates to beat a man who inflicts harm to a woman.ED EXLEY (Guy Pierce) - Exley is the golden boy of the police force, and will do almost anything to get ahead, except sell out by breaking the rules of conduct. He is a straight-laced, strictly by the book officer, who shows his desire to get ahead by his willingness to speak out against other officers when he feels that they do something wrong. ""Are you truly prepared to be despised within the department"", Dudley asks. ""Yes sir, I am"", Exley replies. Dudley also asks him if he would be able to beat a confession out of a man he knew to be guilty, plant evidence on a man he knew to be guilty or shoot a man in the back in order to be sure that some hot shot lawyer would not be able to get him off. Of course, Exley's reply to all of these questions is ""no"".JACK VINCENNES (Kevin Spacey) - Vincennes has a different agenda altogether, and it does not have much to do with justice at all, but nevertheless, his style marks a specific discourse within this particular police department, the LAPD. He wants the spotlight on television and the headlines in the newspaper. He is even the technical advisor for a T.V. show called ""Badge of Honor"". In one brilliant scene Vincennes goes to a house to make an arrest for narcotics abuse and he wants a movie premier in the background of the picture taken by the press.Each of these three men represent different ways (or discourses) of conducting police work. At first, all of these discourses are depicted as separate, but constantly conversing and conflicting with one another.In the course of the film, the Night Owl massacre takes place where a number of patrons are killed as well as White's partner, Stenzland. As the film progresses, the men begin to realize that nothing is black and white and they must work together to solve the crime. Exley suspects that White is up to wrong-doing and thus needs a way of keeping tabs on him. Vincennes agrees to help Exley as long as Exley will help him with another case. The men who were before always displaying conflict are now working with each other. White and Exley are now the true opposing forces within the department and the two come to a violent confrontation when White finds out that they have both been sleeping with the same woman. But despite their differences and perhaps their hate for one another, the men are put in the position of having to put aside their differences and unite their ways in order to solve the case, as Exley has found evidence that another man in the department (that I will not mention) may be the mastermind behind the massacre.At this point it is evident that no one police discourse is going to be enough to solve this crime; both men realize it and accept it. This is exhibited most convincingly in the climax of the film when Exley has the mastermind at gunpoint. The man asks Exley, ""Are you going to shoot me or arrest me""? We of course believe that Exley will make the arrest and further his reputation as the 'golden-boy'. We know this primarily from the earlier conversations between Dudley and Exley. But at the last possible moment, just before all of the backup arrives, Exley seemingly goes against himself and does something that neither he nor Dudley thought he was capable of doing. But the real question is; does he really go against himself? He may seemingly go against his own methodology, but does his view of justice really change or does he come to a higher realization of the essence of justice? I always find myself asking this question as the film ends.

The writers filter just enough so you have to be paying attention. That's annoying to me, because the book was so weaving and sharp. I doubt James Ellroy had any say in the screenplay.The movie tried to be a slick, hit-straight film noir. While that was over all what the novel was on the outside, it was, inside, a deep story that was dark, disturbing, and sometimes sick.

299,cathyyoung1,"Brilliant, powerful, gripping",8,10 May 2000,"A top-notch dark drama of crime and corruption, ""LA Confidential"" is one of the most memorable films of the 1990s, thanks to an intelligent and cliche-free script, good direction, and superb acting.  I'd have to single out Kevin Spacey, who is great in everything (he even redeems ""Outbreak"" from total mediocrity, overshadowing Dustin Hoffman).  Here, he truly shines as Jack Vincennes, an urbane, charming, cynical, somewhat corrupt cop struggling with his conscience.  Almost as outstanding is Danny DeVito as the sleazy tabloid journalist Sid Hudgins.  Kim Basinger gives her subtlest and most nuanced performance ever as Lynn, the call girl made to look like Veronica Lake.  Russell Crowe is excellent as Bud White, the brutish but good-hearted cop, and Guy Pearce gives an utterly convincing and often mesmerizing performance as Edmund Exley, the police officer who starts out as a self-righteous, priggish, ice-cold careerist and then becomes a man of true moral conviction who also has humanity and compassion.  In a lesser but crucial role, James Cromwell is very good as Captain Dudley Smith.The plot was somewhat convoluted, and sometimes it was hard to understand how the characters grasped connections between things that weren't so readily apparent.  However, the film remained suspenseful throughout.  (In a key moment, the identity of the villain is revealed in an act so swift and unexpected that you're guaranteed to jump!) The suspense is well balanced by humor.  What is also impressive about ""LA Confidential"" is the character development.  Exley, White, and Vincennes really grow as human beings in the course of the film, and these changes are conveyed not only through the dialogue and through their actions but also, particularly in Exley's case, through body language and demeanor.  (I don't understand why Guy Pearce isn't getting more good roles!)Truly a wonderful film.",L.A. Confidential
300,isotope2112,A victim of the worst Oscar snub in history...,8,12 April 2002,"At least as far back as I can remember.  L.A. Confidential is a well written, stylish movie.  The acting was superb.  Even Kim Basinger was quite good in this film.  If you like 50's cop dramas... see this movie.The fact this movie lost out to Titanic for best picture is the biggest error the Academy has ever made.  It should have been the choice hands down. I guess everyone makes mistakes sometimes.  8/10.",L.A. Confidential

Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, and Danny DeVito, a terrific cast all in a single movie. It is a movie that I doubt will ever fall from the top movie list. It is a Detective Movie basically with the three main characters, Officer Bud White (Crowe), Sgt. Jack Vincennes (Spacey), and Det. Lt. Ed Exley (Pierce), they are all in different divisions of the LAPD and they are all working on the same case from different ends, finally they all get together and the pieces begin to fall into place. There are so many twists in this movie that it keeps you guessing until the end. So with an all star cast, an all star script, the acting was top notch, which makes for an awesome movie. In the end, a 10 out of 10. And for all of you people out there that like good detective movies, and think that you can solve mysteries right away...

The story is confusing and boring and so are the characters.  Just because the characters talk in low voices and the story is complex doesn't make it ""intelligent"" or ""good"".  All the characters are shallow and some of them act like they don't want to be there, espicially Kevin Spacy and Kim Basinger.  In the end, there is your cliched shootout where all the good guys win and bad guys die.  Russell Crowe gets shot three times, even in the face and still survives.  Also in the end the pretty girl kisses the hero.  And this is supposed to be one of the best movies of the past decade?",L.A. Confidential
304,bill-422,An absolutely superb film noir crime drama.,9,9 August 1999,"Everything about this film is superb.  The story, direction, characters, acting and settings are all crisp and stunning.  The performances by Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito and David Strathairn are all excellent.  Brian Helgelands's violent script adapted from James Ellroy's amazing novel is brilliant.  And the direction by Curtis Hanson is stylish and brutal.  Academy Awards deserved to be spread around the board for this one, but unfortunately, Helgeland's script and Basinger's performance were the only aspect awarded.  (Two of the only awards Titanic didn't win that year).  This film is unfairly compared to ""Chinatown"", but the only similarities between the two are the atmosphere and genre.  ""Chinatown"" contains more complexities in thought and action while ""LA Confidential"" is dense in plot and character action.  ""LA Confidential"" is a superbly well made motion picture and is a must-see for fans of crime drama.  One of the elite in this genre.",L.A. Confidential

Confidential' was done. Much to my surprise, unlike most book-to-movie adaptations, 'L. A. Confidential' was fantastic. The characters came to life and were all enjoyable to watch. It's so shocking how much corruption was going on during this period of time. Personally, I loved Ed, played by Guy Pearce. He was great and it's a real shame that Guy Pearce didn't continue to pick movies like this. I think he could have been really big. This movie was fantastic and totally worth your time.10/10",L.A.

306,newday98074,What?,6,3 April 2007,"I admit to being amazed at the rating for this movie, higher than many better scripted and shot films whose time, I guess, has passed. Younger viewers like the lure of sex and violence in a glittering wrapper regardless of the quality of same. Sin City is the next derivation, and the next? I doubt it will say much about the human condition and how to live better, but then Hollywood has lost the Capras and Wilders who cared. LA confidential is a less than smart story of betrayal, stupidity, corruption, greed, sex and hopelessness. What is lacking is any sense of humanity and why we should want any of these people to live or die. Who are they and what do they tell us about life? Where is beauty, tragedy, sensuality, a sense of the thrilling and ephemeral? Who cares about a comic book?",L.A. Confidential

Confidential (1997) is an excellent illustration of the need to fight fire with fire.,10,25 November 2001,"WARNING - POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREIN.This movie portrays matrixes within matrixes within matrixes, or games within games within games, etc. and illustrates the intense efforts necessary to arrive at the center of the maze.Deception, corruption, and dishonesty are everywhere but fortunately there are some who will go to any length to undue the ball of string.Once exposed, it takes evil to fight evil, with care taken to not become evil in the process.  To quote Christopher Lambert in Beowulf, ""The only thing that keeps me from becoming evil is fighting evil"" and Nicolas Cage in re 8MM, ""One needs to be careful when fighting monsters that they don't become a monster"".This movie portrays in an exceptional manner the forces than can be behind crime and murder and those forces' quests for power and greed. Additionally, it takes one from the nieve state of mind of the young cop (Guy Pearce) to the reality of the world we live in; a maturation process. It also illustrates the driving forces behind human behaviour, i.e., Russell Crowe's character's war against men who abuse women and how his fear and loathing of those characteristics results in his becoming what he feared and loathed in one scene.Overall, an exceptional and informative movie about human nature with as good an ending as can be expected under the circumstances.",L.A.

309,Steviereno,A high moment in Hollywood's history.,10,30 December 1999,"This is written over two years after seeing this remarkable film. Nothing I thought about it then has changed.  Two thirds of the way through my first viewing of ""L.A. Confidential"", it hit me that this was the single best American film I had ever seen.  I cannot put into words how disappointed I was when ""Titanic"" won ""Best Picture"" at the Oscars.  In any other year - other than in competition with the biggest blockbuster of all time (so far) - this movie would have walked away with the Prize. And it would have left everyone stunned at such an accomplished plot, with complex characters, twists and turns, and with an atmosphere as thick as Jupiter's. The multi-threaded plot is not your everyday Hollywood jump-from-character-to-character-and-scene-to-scene, but is absolutely vital to the viewer's descent into early-50s L.A.  The source of the evil underlying the story is a mystery to the viewer for much of the movie.  But it is not a mystery flick.  There is no atmosphere of whodunit, even though the viewer does  wonder who did do it.  But what ""it"" is isn't even made clear in one fell swoop, but is unfolded, peeled like an artichoke, layer by layer.  Who the bad guys and good guys are isn't even made clear for such a long, delicious time.Hear me now and understand me later, the viewer's mind is required to work when watching this movie.  And isn't that a novelty in a Hollywood that foreshadows everything, including breakfast?  Foreshadowing is a wonderful device if used sparingly.  In an era where most films give away (two to five minutes ahead) almost every story twist and turn, ""L.A. Confidential"" uses the time others use in presenting the foreshadowing to actually add substance to the story.  Now, that is a real novelty -- more story.  Leaving the theatre, it is amazing how much story Curtis Hanson packed into this film.Nothing Bogie ever did was better.  No fictional world or city ever drew the viewer in as well as Hanson's Los Angeles.  Those who lived back in the fifties know that THIS place WAS how it was, to a very large extent.For the record, I do NOT like police movies.  They are so cookie-cutter written, cast and directed.  They are all formula and no personality, all loose cannons and bad-cop-good-cop devices.  THIS cop flick was slick, without any of those standard gimmicks.  That is the beauty of it - it defines itself by its own standards, and then implements them without flaw. I could say that it re-defined the genre of cop flicks. I would like to say that others would follow in the same direction.  But those ideas would be self-delusional.  This movie defines only itself, and that definition is this:  a massively, colossal achievement of story, characters and period piece.This movie will certainly grow in stature as the years go by, and will be, not just a 90s classic, but a classic for all time.  It will rightly stand next to ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Citizen Kane"" as a movie that is itself a standard.",L.A. Confidential
310,vinnieboards,Robbery at the Oscars,10,30 July 2010,"The first time I remember a terrible Oscar Best Picture result was in 1988 when the excellent but schmaltzy Rainman, beat the far superior Mississippi Burning in most categories. A travesty of justice - surely it couldn't happen again? In 1997, it did happened again but this time it got a lot worse! Titanic got the thumbs up with its big budget and cute love story when in reality LA Confidential, a gritty film which is almost anonymous by comparison, should have walked it. Certainly one of the best and most intelligent films of the nineties by far, this movie included four of the best acting performances of the decade. Kim Basinger proved that she can act (and in doing so did get an Oscar), whilst a relatively unknown Australian Soap Opera Actor by the name of Guy Pearce waltzed onto the big screen for the first time and stole the show. Add to the mix, Russell Crowe as the cop who dishes out the beatings and the sublime Kevin Spacey and you get an intelligent American thriller right out of the top drawer.I saw this feel almost by accident as it was that poorly promoted and yet if I had a top 10, LA Confidential would be a 'must have'. Its like a drug - as the plot twists and turns the viewer is literally waiting for the next fix to arrive. And it does in spades.There are times when the Academy gets their selections correct. There are other times they get it catastrophically wrong. This is one of those times. Give an Oscar at the time to an unfashionable, unknown Australian who has graduated from Soap Land? - you can almost hear their screams!!",L.A. Confidential
311,BrohmaBull007,The Best of the Good Cop/Bad Cop Theme,9,6 July 2006,"This movie was great. I didn't know what to expect when I rented this but I was pleased with the result. Lets start with acting. Russell Crowe exceeded my expectations and played one of the toughest, roughest cops I've seen. Guy as the nerdy simple cop was annoying at times but towards the end you start to like the guy. Kim Basinger played a surprisingly good performance with her smooth conversational lines and great scene presence. Spacey...although his time was limited did play the role of the wisecrack cop perfectly......spitting out hilarious laid back lines to add comedy to this drama. The character development in this movie is what I liked the most. Every character starts off with a simple label but as they get entwined in the mystery they start changing their attitudes...most of the time it was done so they can get to bottom of the mystery. You'll be surprised as to who is running this crooked cop gang........at least I was. The plot twists were amazing and just when you thought the case was solved they added in reasonable twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat. I'll admit the beginning was good.but towards the middle I started to get confused and bored but at the end.....they kick it up a notch and finish it all off with secrets revealed, puzzles put together, and a great gunfight. If you like cop movies then I suggest this one to start. I thought this movie was overrated on the top 250 but I was not disappointed. Overall 9/10",L.A. Confidential
312,A.P.,very intriguing,10,6 February 1999,"There are only a few mysteries that can keep me guessing and on the edge of my seat like LA Confidential.  At first, there seems to be a few random events and cases until they all come together in one big mystery.  The characters in the movie are all very realistic.   The main characters are the ""good guys"", but it doesn't mean that they are 100% moral.  They all have flaws and do things that the audience won't agree with, but they're still likeable.  Also, don't expect all the characters to come out of the movie alive.",L.A. Confidential
313,secordman,Decent movie but no classic,3,20 January 2002,"First off, although Kim Basinger adds some depth to her character as the film proceeds, it boggles my mind how she was nominated for a best supporting Oscar, let alone win it.  It simply shows how a little buzz from a few people can get a steamroller going.  On the other hand, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe were robbed of nominations, both (especially Pearce) give terrific performances.  This is a story of corruption in the LA police force, and the period atmosphere and byzantine plot make this a modern film noir to be reckoned with.  The body count becomes ridiculously high and this theme has been done much better (see Chinatown) but the end result is a satisfying film.Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito and James Cromwell all add to the enjoyment with their roles.  I still think this film is hugely overrated though, #36 of all time on IMDB is way too high.  LA Confidential is overlong, the plot stretches believability at times and again, this genre has been done better.",L.A. Confidential
314,gpaltrow2001,An all-time fave! Perfect!,10,5 September 2006,"I hardly ever give 10 out of 10, but this film deserves it! It can be viewed over and over and new things still show up. It is gritty; it is a period piece with loving attention to detail; it is sordid; it has GREAT acting; it has twists and turns; it has a great cast! More than anything, it transports you to a time long ago, and makes you believe in it. I remember seeing the movie in the theater, and a week later couldn't remember the names of Russell Crowe or Guy Pearce (lol), but the film stuck with me. I also remember not understanding some things until watching a second time. Now it seems obvious, and just shows how perfect a script it is. Had 'Titanic' not been released the same year, 'L.A. Confidential' would have done better at the Oscars. I remember Kim Basinger promoting the movie on David Letterman. Her husband was releasing 'The Bear' at the same time. She said on the show something like, ""Come see my movie. Who cares about a dumb bear?"" 'The Bear' was simplistic next to this, and so Kim had a hard time 'selling' the film to the talk show audience. Our movie group loves coming up with trivia questions about this movie. Name the motel? The diner? The town Kim's character was from? We don't do that with 'Titanic', lol... 'L.A. Confidential' is one of the all-time greatest!",L.A. Confidential
315,tylerkom,Witty and Sharp,9,30 April 2021,"This is the absolute gold standard for noir. The film is snappy and sharp; the plot moves quickly but gives just enough clues to follow. The acting is phenomenal by each of the main characters and the slimy corrupt world of Los Angeles comes alive.The plot is smart and believable, although slightly too fast for my liking. This is exacerbated by the copious usage of 1950s slang and show business jargon. There is a lot more to be gained from the film by pausing every now and then to pick up exactly what the characters say and what exactly happened.However with that said, the rest of the film is simply fantastic. The set and costume design is outstanding, and the leads do exactly what they are cast to do.Layered and nuanced, the film uncovers the filthy underbelly of public and private life in the city of the angels.

Plus the film exploits minorities as the typical one dimensional mindless thugs as there're portrayed in most cop flicks; but what could you expect from 1950's LA, or Hollywood for that matter?Rating:  4",L.A.

318,debjyoti1981,Perfect Classic,8,12 December 2009,"Curtis Hanson's ""L.A. Confidential"" is an ideal movie on crime, lust & corruption.This movie has skillfully created the atmosphere of 1950's Los Angeles with a nearly perfect soundtrack.Just for the ones who have not yet seen, the story follows the time line of '50s and shows us the story from the stance of three protagonists who used to work for the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department). Shortly they all get caught up in an investigation of multiple homicide case. The movie follows how each of these character deals with the state of affairs. Soon their finding leads them to a murky revelation of corruption which proves to be a deadly game of life and death.Though the story in the present day might look alike with quite a few movies in the recent times, I think every one will find this movie far intriguing than the regular out of mill junks coming out to give us predictable cheap thrill.Apart from the story, the cast chosen for this movie was just awe-inspiring. To name a few, Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kim Basinger. Every one of them has given a brilliant performance.L.A. Confidential can boast with its captivating screenplay and cinematography. This movie has enough twist to make your grey cells burn out..well joking... :) It will be very hard to believe if some one finds this movie less engaging.Will you not all agree with me....

A wonderful distillation of James Ellroy's novel.  It clarifies and simplifies a hugely complex story and still keeps its spirit intact.  It also happens to have the funniest moment in cinema last year. And that moment has historical accuracy.  Take that, Titanic.  Terrific dialogue and an insightful look at issues pertenant today such as tabloid journalism and celebrity worship.The look is dead on and beautiful, costumes lighting etc...  The locations used were great.The acting is wonderful.  Russell Crowe gave my favorite performance of last year.  Kevin Spacey was very close in his finest work yet.  No one else can be complained about.A wonderful throwback to the Hollywood that did things right and it seems to be doing is more consistently.

It's also one of the darkest and most violent film noir's i've ever seen. But none of that will matter as you watch because all you'll be able to think about is how the three main police officers can uncover the web and not get killed in the process.   The three main police officers in question are Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey, The Usual Suspects), Bud White(Russell Crowe, Gladiator) and    Ed Exley(Guy Pearce, Ravenous). Jack is a hollywood cop. He lives for his role as technical advisor on the Dragnet-like show Badge of Honor. He also gets payed by journalist Sid Hudgeons(Danny DeVito, Twins) to give Sid info on busts of celebrities. Bud White is a thug of a cop. He lives to beat confessions out of suspects and to punish woman beaters. Ed Exley is a politician cop. He lives to rise in the ranks of the LAPD and doesn't even care if the whole station despises him.   Add to the mix Captain Dudley Smith(James Cromwell, Babe), callgirl Lynn Bracket(Kim Basinger, The Marrying Man), pornographer Pierce Patchett(David Strathairn, The Firm) and dirty District Attorney Ellis Loew(Ron Rifkin, The Negotiator) and you have a web of corruption, cops, porn and Los Angeles that makes for the most entertaining and best movie of 1997.

I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes suspense, comedy, drama, adventure and a little cynical satire. Past history and police corruption are the main areas of exploration for this film. The heroes are not saints and the bad guys are not total devils, but the viewers will have an opinion in the end. Humor and serious drama are blended well and the characters skillfully and deliberately exploit that intent.",L.A. Confidential
326,jacegaffney,Only Cromwell remains on top,7,27 July 2010,"Just watched this movie again last night. Thirteen yrs ago this picture received - across the board - the best set of reviews of ANY movie ever released in the history of Warner Brothers.Today, it doesn't deserve that kind of hype. The list of reservations runs remarkably deep in hindsight. The script feels rushed and underdeveloped at key plot points (What does it represent, three novels boiled into one screenplay?) The romantic (triangle) subplot comprised of Russell Crowe, Kim Bassinger and Guy Pearce is grotesquely handled (compare it to the languorous sparring of Mel Gibson, Michelle Pfeiffer and Kurt Russell in the underrated ""guilty pleasure,"" TEQUILA SUNRISE) Bassinger's performance is arguably the lamest one to ever be awarded a supporting Oscar. The love scenes between her and Crowe are written in the form of a fervent adolescent's sincerest wet dream. Psychological explanations are purest pulp. The mise-en-scene, which I thought was a tad overrated even at the time, now looks to be exclusively the work of the production research department. Visually, its actually pretty flat, playing like a solid cable series with some key episodes missing. Yet having said that much, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL benefits mightily from having a spectacular, cunningly sinister villain in James Cromwell. He is as good as one's memory of him. The climax of the picture, where his wickedness appears well-nigh omnipotent (Noah Cross with a badge)and, in classic melodramatic fashion, one fears for the lives of the two righteous detectives who are out to crack the case - yes, this last section still holds up and delivers the goods.So in retrospect, I remain charitable and credit it a 7 out of 10 because so few melodramas have heart these days and this far-fetched conspiracy tale does reflect the convictions of its author, James Ellroy - even if what those convictions add up to is less than meets the eye.Was this review useful to you?",L.A.

The book is better and I'm glad I'd read it before I saw the film, which I found a little confusing, but then perhaps that was because I'd read the book.Excellent performances by Guy Pearce, who is very under-rated in my view, and Russell Crowe, not then the mega star he is now. I found Spacey a little bland and uninteresting. How fit is Kim Basinger? She was wonderful! Even Danny DeVito, who usually annoys me intensely, was well above average.Recommended viewing but then read the book or any of the other LA-based novels by Ellroy - they are superb!",L.A.

The script is masterful, with intrigue and rich, three dimensional characters. They have such history and meaning that their motives are abundantly clear, without being too obvious. Even Kim Bassinger did an outstanding job (her Oscar was much deserved).It really is a beautiful film to watch, too.

After you first see it, you'll appreciate it, but not nearly as much as you do the 5th or 6th time. The truth is, the more you see it, the more you love it. It never gets old. I'm not someone who reviews movies by revealing the plot, but I will say that this has a fairly complex one, with many characters. (Another reason why you should see it multiple times) The acting is excellent, particularly by Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe and Kevin Spacey. They make you love the characters, despite their obvious and sometimes extreme flaws. (Doesn't that make them more likeable?) The direction is incredible, as well as the script. They both make the film VERY well rounded and memorable. It's a shame that ""L.A. Confidential"" didn't win Best Picture, and it should have been nominated for twice as many awards. The bottom line: Rent ""L.A. Confidential"" for a film whose characters and story you a sure to never forget. ""Just the Facts...""",L.A. Confidential
330,melinetto,awesome movie with a bunch of incredible performances,9,25 August 2021,"I played a game on PS4 called ""L. A. Noire"" and then recently, when i've watched this film, it makes me think of that game instantly. The Mad Men crew starred in the game tho lol. Anyways, i don't know anything about where the inspiration comes from to the writer of the game but L. A. Confidential definitely helps. It has taken straight from the movie. You know, the era, the clothes, the cars, mystery crime thriller, a detective who gets a promotion all the way up, even the narrative comes from the headlines in each chapter. Anyway, i keep going on about it but all i'm saying is that there's a big connection.Going back to the movie, it's 1950s. I always love this era. The clothes, the places, the cars, anything about it. We've got a really well written script. Even though, it is predictable for some people who the actual ""traitor"" is but i thought Pierce Patchett is the man in charge of all of this for a long time. At the end, Bud White is still alive after all that shooting, it's a bit exaggeration in my opinion. However, it's really a nice point of view from Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson which externalize the decay of the system at the end. The audience know that there's a corruption in the LAPD and it's completely rotten. You know, the movie ends with a scene which is the LAPD decides to protect their image by saying Smith died a hero in the shootout, while awarding Exley a second medal for bravery. Danny DeVito plays Sid Hudgens who publishes Hush-Hush tabloid magazine. The screenwriters use the headlines for explaining the events and what's actually going on and DeVito narrates all the happenings. As for me, It's very well-thought-of by them. Furthermore, the scene called ""Bloody Christmas"" which is Dick Stensland and other cops take a brutal vengeance on some Mexican prisoners and beat them up is very well reflected by again, the way of using the headlines.Character of Ed Exley is very well written and Guy Pierce portrays incredibly well. Russell Crowe gives a fine performance too but i really enjoy the performance of Kevin Spacey. The role of Jack Vincennes suits for him and he portrays the character in a classy way. Likewise, Kim Basinger gives an awesome performance, definitely Oscar-worthy. I think that the character of Lynn Bracken is written for a really beautiful and gorgeous woman such as Basinger, she's combining with a pure and delicate way of acting that makes a terrific performance.I gotta say, the scene which is Jack Vincennes was killed by Capt. Dudley Smith is so shocking and unexpected. And the detail of Rollo Tomasi which is Jack murmurs after Smith shot him makes the scene to a perfect one.Frankly, it's one of the best films i've ever watch, i'll definitely recommend it. Solid 9.",L.A. Confidential
331,zeemaza,A masterpiece of storytelling ...,10,29 April 2020,"I have seen so many reviews tell people what this movie is about; they are all wrong! This movie is simply about how a corrupt police force bids to take over a criminal empire after the emperor is sent to prison; the emperor being the infamous Mickey Cohen. Their clever efforts are muffled by three very different, intensely smart cops that were considered to be their friends.A piece of advice: concentrate! Don't wonder off to the toilet or kitchen without rewinding when you get back! Every single word in this highly complex story counts.This is by far the best cop thriller ever made. The characters are just exploding with, well ... character! And although the two main characters start out by unquestionably hating what each other stand for, by the end they fully understand and respect one another regardless of the fact that they had wronged each other irreversibly.The cinematography is outrageous, the mood electrifying and the dialogue is cutthroat.I believe the only reason this movie isn't among the top 10 of all time is that it is too complex. Many people will miss much of it until they have watched at least three times, if not more.Enjoy.",L.A. Confidential

The cast is perfect, the dialogue is amazing, as are the costumes.  Even the setting seems perfect. Now, step deeper into the film.  I see this film is dependent on media for the film.  The media appears to be everywhere you look in L.A. Confidential. Had this film been made at the time of The Maltese Falcon (1942), the media wouldn't have been as omniprescent.  It is interesting to note the similarities between the two films, as both are examples of the classical Hollywood narration.

Guy Pearce's character is laughably bad.The dialogue is atrocious - It's completely unnatural with too much exposition, uses every crime drama cliché in the book, it feels like a robot watched every noir film and churned out its best attempt at putting them all together - and the result is horrendous.The so-called story is just plain boring, yet somehow extremely overcomplicated. For me, it was impossible to follow - and no I'm not a Transformers fan who can't watch anything ""cerebral"" - I just appreciate a coherent narrative, that's told economically and efficiently. A murder happens I guess? Then there's some violence? A weird sequence with a prostitute? I don't know.As for the apparent 'style' - this is one of the least stylish films I've ever seen. The colour palette is horrible and murky - everything looks... beige... - and the lighting is bland.To say this film can't hold a candle to American noir classics like Double Indemnity would be an understatement. LA Confidential is an insult, and I am genuinely irritated by how criminally overrated this film is.",L.A. Confidential

A tight script and all-round stellar performances by the cast. As an Australian, I was particularly heartened by the performances of Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe.

When I watch old favorites, I often downgrade my ratings (you know, there is more to love than first sights)This one I upgraded from 9/10 to 10/10. This movie is flawless. The story alone would make this a standout film: it is complex enough that it requires the viewer's full attention, with turns of events that are deeply entertaining even on repeated watching. But the movie more than just a great story: it is action packed entertainment that is long but fast paced (you may need to strain your brain to follow the full story, but it's all there, no shortcuts, plot holes or leaps of faith), and also beautifully crafted cinema (glamorously produced and shot, with great music and cast). It is also a piece of art: its characters are deep enough to engage the viewer, they evolve with the story and the acting is absolutely flawless.This is a great film no matter how you classify it: as a crime story, or an action flick, or a period gangster movie, or drama or other genres that I will not mention to avoid spoilers.

James Cromwell is supreme and commanding as captain Dudley smith. Danny DeVito plays the excellent news reporter and Kim Basinger is also good as Lynn Bracken. But it is Kevin Spacey who gives the standout performance of the film and should have at least been nominated for best supporting actor at the Oscars. his performance is (in my opinion) up their with other great performances (Daniel Day-Lewis in there will be blood, and Al pacino in Scent of a Woman).This film is a true classic and will be around forever.10/10.",L.A.

I liked it, but i knew half way through it was the chief of police. my guess is they did a really good job hyping this movie up, but to be as high as it is on the Top 250 is kind of unwarranted to me. I would hardly call this movie ""epic"" which is the rating it has gotten. There are far better movies that are rated much lower than this.

348,doctorx2,A Modern Classic,10,9 November 2006,"LA Confidential has all of the qualities that, over time, earn a film the honorific, ""classic."" The story is involved and involving, and quickly pulls the viewer into trying to solve the mystery along with the main characters. The script is brisk and clever, the editing moves along at a solid pace that builds toward the end, the images of old LA are realistic and convincing, and the character portrayals are more than wonderful, they're truly memorable. It's safe to say that in many respects this film provided break-out roles for Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pearce.Crowe's Bud White steals the show -- brutal, tender, complex, and in his own way, rigidly principled, White is a powerful character whose presence dominates scenes. Crowe's earlier role in Virtuosity showed a tiny, violent piece of Bud White, but lacked his complexity and depth. Bud White showed the world what Russell Crowe can really do on screen.LA Confidential similarly makes the best use of Kevin Spacey's abilities, in his role as the world-weary, cynical, smart and smarmy Jack Vincennes. Spacey's earlier work (e.g., The Usual Suspects) is terrific and memorable, but Jack Vincennes paved the way for the Spacey characterizations viewers love in his later films (e.g., Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, American Beauty, Pay it Forward, and the less acclaimed Beyond the Sea).The role of Edmund Exley provided Guy Pearce with an opportunity to demonstrate some of his enormous range as an actor, alternately appearing naive, self-righteous, scared, street-wise, and menacing. These qualities appear in the widely varied but dynamic characters he has created in subsequent films (Memento, The Count of Monte Cristo, The Time Machine).More than reliable, the supporting cast also creates characters that are believable, complex, and a pleasure to watch. Kim Basinger's wise and weary Lynn Bracken may represent her best work on screen. James Cromwell, often cast as a failed administrator, is wonderfully hate-able as the cool and corrupt Captain Dudley Smith. Danny DeVito romps as slimy Sid Hudgens, and David Strathairn's Pierce Morehouse Patchett is subtle and believable. Patchett almost certainly brought Straithairn the role of Edward R. Murrow in 2005's Good Night, and Good Luck. Ron Rifkin, Matt McCoy, and the rest of the cast also bring realism and energy to their roles, making the film solid and believable.The story itself is compelling and enjoyable, a cops-and-robbers whodunit with several twists. The dialog ranges from moving to hilarious to terrifying to inspiring, without losing the story's consistency. The story's conclusion is dramatic, action-packed, and contains a few sweet surprises.Anyone interested in seeing the early work of Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, or Guy Pearce should see LA Confidential. Anyone interested in seeing a great film should see LA Confidential. It's one of those films worth owning and watching a few times a year. Which is to say, it's a classic.",L.A. Confidential
349,kreamykonez97,Slightly better than Jaws 4,3,26 January 2007,"LA CONFIDENTIAL 1997 (KEVIN SPACEY, RUSSELL CROWE, KIM BASINGER) DIRECTED BY CURTIS HANSON ~ THE RUNDOWN: Apart from a juiced-up cast and a slick image, there is absolutely nothing worthwhile about this vastly overrated movie. ~ Okay, I saw LA Confidential right around the same time I saw Jaws: The Revenge, and I can honestly say without joking that this wasn't much better. To back up my outrageous opinion on this movie, I have comprised a list that I will present of why this movie sucks the big one. ~ 1) The premise of the movie is just plain dull! The basic story/concept is ridiculously stupid, boring and pointless, with almost no imagination whatsoever. Nothing of what we are offered draws us in therefore making the act of watching the movie a chore. 2) The script, like the basic story is just bland. Nothing in it has any redeeming value for the viewer; no wit or humor, not enough violence to make a stink; stale, washed-up dialogue...nothing that even begins to entertain. It is very muddled, however, and does succeed at purposely confusing us to try and hide up its retarded, brain-dead story until everything falls oh-so nicely into place for the breathtaking finale...ha, yeah right! 3) There's no originality here, and once you get down to it, this is really just another Tarantino/Pulp Fiction rip-off, not even a good one that. Except, of course, there's no Tarantino! Nope, instead you get the blazing originality of Curtis Hanson, Mr. Lifetime Movie himself. 4) Not an ounce of style is to be found anywhere in the general proximity of this movie. None. That's right, none. So what if it looks good visually? It doesn't even begin to innovate in story or otherwise. Sure, it tries embarrassingly hard to set itself apart with the whole Film-Noir B.S., but the only real category it falls into is your average, commercialized, Hollywood trash category. If you think there's style to be found here, maybe you have a sixth sense for it because I couldn't detect any. 5) For this fifth point, I will draw a comparison between the movie's cast and a baseball player named Barry Bonds...they're both on steroids. Yeah, basically, the overblown acting ensemble of the movie (Spacey, Basinger, Crowe, Devito, Straithairn, Pearce) is absolutely wasted. There are great actors in this movie but their skills are wasted and not challenged at all, making their performances meaningless. The roles that they play are generic and turn these fine actors into robots for the entire length of the movie. 6) Kim Basinger is effin weird. ~ In the IMDb.COM trivia section it says how this was supposed to be a TV show starring Kiefer Sutherland. Ha. Well, I am quite confident this particular episode of pointlessness and boredom would not have made the greatest hits compilation.",L.A. Confidential
350,cfcpg,Simply of no interest,4,23 April 2007,"I had a bad feeling about this one. Something told me I wasn't going to like it. And after 60 seconds it started my feelings were right. The movie starts with a narration. There is narrator speaking and I didn't understand anything. After 40 minutes I still had no idea what was going on. That is bad. It is not my fault if the storyline isn't well exposed. Ask Martin Scorsese how to keep a viewer glued to his seat with a narration (CASINO). So the story is either weak or non-existing. I hate movies that take place during the fifties because the actors in their swanky suits feel authorized to overact. I said actors? Who are they? How much charisma do they have? If we take Spacey, Crowe, Pearce and Basinger and put them all together we don't reach 20% of Jack Nicholson alone. This movie is a bad imitation of CHINATOWN.",L.A. Confidential

Russel Crowe seemed to play a typical role, but very well.  Kevin Spacey is always excellent.  I'm sure Kim Basinger's acting was marvelous as well but I was so distracted by how gorgeous she was I could hardly pay attention.  The plot ranks up there, probably above The Usual Suspects.  I think the twist at the end of Usual Suspects was better, but everything in LA Confidential is brilliant.  The characters are all so well developed. My only complaint is that Guy Pearce's character seemed too easily accepted after his ratting out other officers.  Not downplay Guy Pearce's performance which was also quite good.  I can't believe I hadn't heard more about this movie before.  This movie is to film and the 1950's LA scene what The Great Gatsby was to literature and the 1920's Jazz Age, but much more entertaining than the Great Gatsby.",L.A. Confidential

354,emeeme2003,"""Go home son; this is the city of angels, and you haven't got any wings.""",9,15 March 2021,"Hollywood; the name alone immediately conjures up images of the cinematic glamour that the world's largest film industry has created for over a century now, and no other time is more synonymous with that glamour than the Classical era, when the blockbusters were larger than life itself (and in Technicolor!), the world's biggest stars were being sold to the public with an assembly line-efficiency, and the towering, monolithic studio system reigned supreme, and without question.However, beneath this paper- thin surface of glamour lay an ugly underbelly, one where multiple starlets were pressured into having abortions, sexual harassment was viewed as just another cost of doing business (and still is, to a certain degree), and organized crime ran rampant across the not-so-angelic city, and in 1997, Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential had the unflinching honesty to shine a spotlight on not only the long-dead cockroaches of mid-century L.A., but also the contemporary scandals that still plagued the ""City Of Angels"", creating what is quite possibly the finest work of neo-noir that the titular town made during that decade in the process.Adapted from James Ellroy's 1990 novel of the same title, Confidential's ensemble-based plot is driven primarily by three members of the LAPD; Bud White, a menacing, hair trigger-tempered officer who brutally pummels wife-beaters in his ""free time"", Jack Vincennes, a cocky, paparazzi-hounding narc, and Ed Exley, an embarrassingly straight-laced, goody two shoes sergeant who finds himself hopelessly alienated within the department, due to his eagerness to take a stand against the brutal, illicit methods of his fellow officers, refusing to adhere to the code of silence that has silenced so many police scandals over the years.However, in the wake of a brutal botched robbery turned all-out bloodbath at a local diner, one that turns out to be even more insidious than it initially appears, the paths of all three men will become irrevocably tangled, as they chase a series of tantalizing clues, untrustworthy prostitutes, and a bloody trail of bodies as they pile up all over Tinseltown, uncovering a seemingly endless series of conspiracies and corruption that leads them all the way back into the dark heart of the department itself.Admittedly, like many other works of film noir, the plot of L.A. Confidential is fairly complex and convoluted, but, while I do feel some of the moments of exposition here could've been handled in a bit more of an elegant manner, for the most part, Hanson and screenwriter Brian Helgeland do a strong job of juggling the various sub-plots, weaving a knotty, multi-threaded tale in a fairly coherent manner, and trading off perspectives between the various main characters as the paths continually intersect, as their individual investigations eventually merge into one, a process that's all the more compelling to watch given the fundamental strength of their vivid, three-dimensional characterizations, whether it be the way that Vincennes' self-centeredness and hunger for publicity (as seen in his gig moonlighting as an advisor for a Dragnet-knockoff called ""Badge Of Honor"") belies his underlying passion for justice, how Ed's rigid insistence on following the rules begins to bend when he realizes that he'll never solve this case doing everything strictly ""by the books"", or how Bud's initial image of being a mindless thug with an obsessive ""hobby"" of hurting men who hurt women was brought about by a childhood of helplessly witnessing his father beat his mother (culminating in her murder after he was left chained to a radiator for three days).In a film where everyone has a dark secret lurking somewhere in their past, he's the most haunted of them all, which ties into the way that L.A. Confidential's excels not only by drawing historical context from the real-life sins of Los Angeles past, but of present and future as well; obviously, the film's plot is driven by the vacuum left in the local underworld by the arrest of real-life crime lord Mickey Cohen for tax evasion in 1951 (just like Capone, because were you expecting Hollywood to be original?), but, since the film itself was released when it was, it also serves as a cold splash of water, harking back to the racial tensions that have historically haunted the LAPD, not just during the ""Bloody Christmas"" era of the 50's (which a fictionalized version of actually figures into the film's plot), but as well of the contemporary examples of institutional corruption, brutality, and racism that rocked the department throughout the 90's, in the forms of the Rodney King beating, or the fiasco that was the OJ trial (which makes the quick cameo in the film by former chief Daryl Gates all the more ironic), as well as reminding us of the wave of sexual misconduct scandals in the Weinstein-era, due to the unfortunate presence of Kevin Spacey, and his character's involvement in a sub-plot involving a young, gay actor, which has given the film an unexpectedly long-lasting political relevance in the decades following its release.Finally, Confidential is great simply in the way that it revitalizes its well-worn genre with its quippy, razor-sharp dialogue, pacing that knows exactly when to crackle along, and when to pump the brakes and let us just soak in the rich, cynical atmosphere of underlying corruption, and the way the film balances its tributing of old-school noir with its melodramatic, tumpet-heavy score, and usage of familiar tropes like the femme fatale (provided here in an Oscar-winning turn from a superb Kim Basinger), while also revitalizing it by forgoing the shadow-drenched black-and-white cinematography that defined the genre during its classical period, in favor of a brighter, more naturalistic lighting scheme, lending the film a bracing sense of you-are-there immediacy, and preventing it from feeling like some nostalgic museum piece. All in all, L.A. Confidential is one of the best film noirs to be made since the end of the style's classical era, and the greatness on display here is one secret you won't want to keep off the record, on the QT, or very ""hush-hush"" at all.",L.A.

Taken into consideration L.A Confidential excels at using each member of its talented cast to the best of their abilities to create an intriguing watch which one might argue helped these actors to go onto make such fantastic film as Crowe in Gladiator, Spacey in American Beauty, Pearce in the count of Monte cristo. L.A confidential managed to surprise me with a variety of different characters from the troubled hardy Bud white to the lifestyle of high class Prostitute Lynn.

But oh my god, this film pushes jerry maguire into the ground in a blink of an eye, if it comes to those elements. If you just look at the character of Russel Crowe, which starts off as someone who is only good in beating people up, but later when he falls in love with Basinger's character, he totally comes around, being much more passionate, and much smarter. As goes for Pierce's character, which is actually exactly the opposite turnaround, than that of Crowe's. He actually learnes to beat, and punish people.The acting in this movie is phenomonal. What i read in another comment is true. If Titanic didn't sank 90 years ago, L.A. Confidential would have scattered all the oscars. I'd recommend this movie to all of you who like Pulp Fiction. Just leave out the 'Tarantino-effect' and put it back 40 years.i give it a 8.",L.A. Confidential

362,Valithanithizum,Will Always be Relevant,10,6 January 2012,"Almost 14 years after it's release L.A Confidential has stood up to the test of time brilliantly. Thanks in part to it's key components. First, it has one of the most fluid story lines ever delivered with spot on pacing, tons of action, and twists and turns galore. No filler, just straight unadulterated goodness.Extremely strong acting, the movie is phenomenally cast with a young powerhouse triage of Russel Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Spacey. They all have key and integral components for the wicked story as it unfolds. Finally culminating in a climax of interlocking beauty.This is one of those movies that will stay relevant for ever. It's just integral viewing, and one of the best Noir's or films of any genre for that matter anywhere. It's a classic, what else can you say besides that it should be required viewing no matter who you are.",L.A. Confidential

364,Otis Lou Bohr,"Silly, But Entertaining",7,25 June 2001,"All things considered, this film is actually quite palatable: I never once thought ""dear lord, when will this thing end?"" But having now watched it twice I still fail to comprehend why anyone would consider it great. Three stereotypical characters in search of an overarching theme lurch from one pretty set-piece to the next, eventually reaching a conclusion that would have been screamingly inappropriate, had what preceded been in the least cohesive.Good accompaniment to a nice bowl of popcorn, but cinematic genius? No.",L.A. Confidential
365,jefflittle19,A very strong film,10,21 June 2003,LA Confidential is a very strong film and really should have topped Titanic in 1997 for the Oscar. Kevin Spacey is wonderous in his role as is Russell Crowe in one of his first major motion pictures. James Cromwell really seemed like he was made to play Captain Dudley Smith. A very interesting story with lots of twists and turns. Don't miss this one!My rating : @@@@ 1/2 (out of five),L.A. Confidential
366,ecapital46,"A Totally, I Mean TOTALLY Overrated Movie!",5,29 June 2006,"This movie is full of too many negative messages, inconsistencies and stereotypes to be rated anywhere near being a 'classic.' Two police officers are awarded at the end of the film - one gets the beautiful girl, and the other gets his second police medal - and you are left wondering, ""huh?"" The officer who gets the girl is a complete thug of a police officer with complete disdain for proper police procedures and due process. His method of choice when seeking information and dealing with disappointing situations is to get physical or to abuse and threaten whomever he is dealing with - citizens, his girlfriend or even fellow cops. The film awards him the girl (a high-class hooker) after he established a 'relationship' with her while he was working on a murder case in which she is significantly involved. The other officer who receives the police medals is suppose to be the films moral compass. During the film he speaks up on the transgressions and immorality in the LAPD, but we too find him later making intense physical sexual advances (he actually literally rapes her)at the high-class hooker who has already been sleeping with his thug cop coworker. At the end of the film, Mr Moral Compass then proceeds,in summary judgement style, to kill another officer -unnecessarily shooting him in the back - after the latter cop had been apprehended for murdering other police officers and aligning himself with the local MOB drug trade. This repeated issuance of summary judgments at the barrel of a gun in this film with no retribution is disturbing.Also disturbing is the fact that in this film of 1952 Los Angeles, the only Black faces seen in the entire film are three criminal youths who, after being rounded up and interrogated, admit to the senseless rape of a Mexican girl. With aid from an unverified and false police statement from the rape victim, the three youth then are also charged with conducting the multiple diner murders which are at the heart of the movie's story. After somehow escaping police custody, the three youths are later summarily gunned down in a violent police raid at their residence. A fourth unnamed older black man is found watching TV in one of the rooms in the house where the rape occurred, but he is for no reason summarily murdered by the thug cop before he is even questioned on the extent of his involvement. Of course, there is no accountability for this murder, as the officer is later seen riding off in the sunset with the pretty girl at movies end.Sure its ""only a movie,"" and after all, 'LA Confidential' is all about corruption and vice rampant in the LAPD during this period. However, no ""classic"" presents all these inexplicable, incongruous and unresolved issues without even attempting to address them. The oversight is too obvious. The 1950's nostalgia, slick production values and sharp wardrobes can't hide these missing elements of the film. It's about as visible as the Grand Canyon.",L.A. Confidential
367,Amigard,Who's who?,8,7 November 1998,"To tell it all at once: overall the movie is great, but (a very big but), two of the main actors look too much like each-other (Kevin Spacey and Russel Crowe). They act great, but if they had less resemblance it would be a lot better. And I really don't understand why Kim Bassinger got an Oscar for this. Minnie Driver and Joan Cusack did a lot better than the Veronica Lake look-alike.",L.A. Confidential
368,Texasguy,Gorgeous!,10,3 November 1999,"Say what you will, but history will prove this film as the greatest movie of 1997. The acting is greater, script deeper, and story much more engaging than the utterly ridiculous ""Titanic."" Kim Basinger is outstanding, Kevin Spacey gives his best performance, and Russell Crowe completely steals the show. This is the only film of the 1990's that can be compared with Chinatown. Go out and see it!",L.A. Confidential
369,javold,Elroy delivers: crisp characters and a classic noir plot,9,1 November 1999,"L.A. Confidential is my top pick among American films of 1997, rating second only to Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful.  Both movies can attribute their success to one person's efforts; in the case of L.A. Confidential, practically everything is owed to the story's original writer, James Elroy.Elroy crafted a sharp story around four excellent main characters and several notable multi-dimensional sub-characters.  Of the main characters, three protagonists and a central villain, each one had become a policeman for a different reason, each one was markedly different from the other (brought together only by crafty writing) and, with one exception, each steps disturbingly out of character at some point in the story.  It is by their stepping out that this movie is a classic film noir and not just another cop and gangster flick.I give the movie a 9 overall: 10 for the writing and 8's and 7's for everything else.  The director, partly as a co-screenwriter, commendably captured the era and added visual crispness to Elroy's story, but I will need to see more from him before I take notice of his own merit.  Likewise, the actors stepped neatly into their characters but do not especially stand out: Spacey's good, but better in Usual Suspects; Bassinger's surprisingly good, and most of the other actors were unremarkable. The writing, though, speaks for itself.",L.A. Confidential
370,lilkbraptor15,The best movie of all time,10,4 September 2002,"When L.A. Confidential first came out on video in 1998, I really did not want to see the movie for some reason, and did not see it until a couple of weeks ago when it aired on TBS. I was blown away, so I decided to buy the DVD and man that movie is awesome. I truly believe that my favorite actor, Russell Crowe deserved an Oscar nomination and so did Guy Pearce. The fact that Titanic won best picture over L.A. Confidential is just pathetic...What was the academy thinking?Anyway, highly recommended for those who like to be entertained. You will not be disappointed.10/10",L.A. Confidential
371,DeathFish,Acivement in world class,9,14 May 2007,"L.A. Confidential is perhaps, one of the best and most intriguing pieces of moving picture in the past few decades. The brilliancy of the script itself, deserves a standing ovation, because it is in my opinion, one of the most thought-out and nerve wrecking of its time. The direction by Curtis Hanson gives this intense and complex movie softness and makes a gentle approach to the audience, because none of the material is forced through, but instead it rests quietly in the subconsciousness of the audience the whole time. The plot is just awesome and stands out from any of the former (and later) police/criminal movies, because we get to experience the action behind the curtain, from a passive point of view. The plot has a great balance between tossing us into the action, and gently luring us through one mystery after another, trying to find the answers. The actors give the ideas of the script and the characters faces, and gives us a chance to relate and identify with the characters involved. Each of them delivers great performances: Spacey as always smart, sly and above all believable, though he does not exceed his brilliant performance in ""The Usual Suspects"". Crowe with his, so far, best performance in my opinion, with temper and depth. Pearce with an OK performance without really reaching the top, but fills out his character nicely. Devito is amusing and cool and does everything he can to contribute to this movie. Basinger with her Oscar-winning role, plays the beautiful blond convincingly and spices up the last aspect of the movie, with splendor and depth as well. Alltogehter this makes one hell of a good movie. Fast, smart, complicated, exciting, raw and above all believable and entertaining. Well done by the creators of L.A. Confidential.",L.A. Confidential
372,dandare4479,LA Confidential is a Masterpiece,10,26 June 2013,"LA Confidential is a great film, based on a great book of the same name by James Ellroy. It is filled with fabulous characters from the 1950's LA police department each with their own subplots. The three main characters will have to work together to bring down corruption in the LA police department. All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce. LA confidential on paper sounds boring, but give it a chance and you will be caught up in its deep and intriguing plot as it unfolds. Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell. I highly recommend LA Confidential as one of the best films of the 90s, it was unlucky to come out the same year as Titanic as it would of certainly won more Oscars then it did.",L.A. Confidential

376,Bronze,L. A. Confidential vs. Titanic,10,28 July 1999,"Acting: Kim Basinger got an oscar for her performance to prove that L. A. Confidential has better acting. Titanic got two nominations but even those performances were not the best they could have been.Directing: Curtis Hanson got the nomination but Cameron the oscar. Why? Cameron's movie was more popular. Curtis Hanson was able to direct scenes so that they flowed together. In L. A. Confidential all of the scenes came together. In Titanic it was going from one scene to the next except it never flowed and never particularly came together.Screenplay: The screenplay in L. A. Confidential was cutting edge, straight at you, and perfection. In Titanic. "" I'm just a tumbleweed blowing in the wind ""Musical Score: The score for L. A. Confidential went right along with the movie. There was never a moment when the music did not draw you into the scene. With Titanic it only distracted me. I also recognized several of the melodies from other songs.So why did Titanic beat L. A. Confidential for the Best Motion Picture oscar? Popularity. My Score 10/10",L.A. Confidential
377,lemasque,Only half GREAT!,5,7 October 2002,"Reviewers have been far too generous in praise of La Confidential. The script is a perfect example of Hollywood once again dropping the ball. The first half of the film is GREAT, as good or better than I wanted it to be: a juicy plot (plus various sub plots) of just the right complexity, a seductively delicious milieu, and fascinating characters.WARNING: SOME OF WHAT FOLLOWS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED SPOILERS!Suddenly without warning, the story switches to the favorite action movie plot used by every other Hollywood hack  THE BIG CHEESE VILLAIN. You know this one, the evil authority figure symbolizing the corrupt establishment (such as a CEO, superior military officer, high government official, football coach, etc.) that no one would ever suspect turns out to be the criminal mastermind behind all the movie's mischief and mayhem. That worked in This Gun For Hire with Alan Ladd, but has been beat to death since Viet Nam and Watergate.From the moment that Kevin Spacey is killed, the movie runs on automatic scriptwriter. As always the case with THE BIG CHEESE VILLAIN FORMULA, the major plot conflict and all sub plots can be conveniently resolved with an action packed ending where the hero (or heroes in this case) confront the villain and an army of evil henchmen in a setting reminiscent of the OK Corral. In the end, countless bad guys are blown away, yet THE BIG CHEESE is left to kill. As we've seen many times before, the crafty arch villain almost kills our heroes. And just when you've given up all hope, those physically and emotionally wounded good guys manage some last minute gunplay neatly dispatching old Mr. Corruption. And the world is right again.
As a bonus, the filmmakers of LA Confidential tacked on a schmaltzy epilogue with some cornball lines and long pathetic stares. This is a painfully obvious attempt to dupe us into thinking we experienced something profound. Oh yes, our heroes are a little more cynical, but they are much wiser, caring men, and their tarnished honor is still intact. Reminds me of Nancy Olson's line in Sunset Boulevard, `...just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.'If you award flawed films like LA Confidential a top rating, what about noir classics like The Big Sleep, Out Of The Past, and Chinatown -- twenty stars at least? Personally, I would have enjoyed seeing more of Kevin Spacey and the 50s TV angle  as that's something different. I guess the filmmakers were constrained by the book, which I haven't read. But that doesn't excuse throwing out creative license, taking the easy way out, and opting for THE BIG CHEESE VILLAIN FORMULA, even if it's in the book.",L.A. Confidential

381,bryanus,Excellent,10,18 November 2009,"This film is great from start to absolute finish. The interesting thing is that it is obviously set in Los Angeles; and I personally hate Los Angeles (I live here), but this is Los Angeles in a supernatural reality. There's nothing overtly fantastical about this movie, but its almost as if you imagine every villain in this movie to be a demon (and the villains aren't always cut and dried, even the ""heroes"" are suffering from some type of pathos). In terms of my favorite Russell Crowe movie, this is it. I can't remember if they actually describe him in the movie as being all brawn and no brain; but that exactly describes his character. This is the first movie that I ever saw Guy Pearce in, and I fell in love with his acting ability. Kim Basinger is great too, and her acting is ironically understated. I've lived in L.A. all my life, but this is an L.A. that I'm not really used to; but definitely like. There is a really strong visual component to the movie. Very vivid.",L.A. Confidential

This movie had me hyped from the beginning itself.This movie didn't drift away in its plot,it had us focused on one single thing throughout the movie and the writers have clearly done a lot of homework, trying to use all the elements maximum possible. The character of Russell crowe was so dynamic,full of life and the chemistry between the three main actors were greatly shown. There can't be a better cop movie with corruption. And as I said earlier,this movie deserves more rating.",L.A. Confidential
384,Sickfrog,The Best Film of 1997,10,14 August 1998,"Truly, one of the greatest mistake the Academy has made is not awarding this film the Best Picture award. For months, I argued that while ""Titanic"" was a nice spectacle with great special effects, the script, the directing and the acting was all rather mediocre. However, here we have ""L.A. Confidential."" Perfection in script. Perfection in directing. Perfection in cast. Obviously, because Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey all gave Oscar worthy performances, the voting was split, and therefore, none got enough votes for a nomination.    Crowe gave an invigorating performance and Bud White, a man who knows that he is not very smart and has instead relied on pure brawn all his life. But as the film progresses, you watch him yearn to put his strength aside and become self-reliant, instead of being purely muscle for the cause of justice, which has become obscured as he has had to resort to violent and debatably immoral method to preserve peace in Los Angeles. And yet, while he does make us question whether he is going to end up on the side of good or evil by the end of the film uncertain, we do empathize enough with him to hope that he does redeem himself by the end.    Pearce delivers Ed Exley as a man who is wholly set on the purest means of justice. While he follows his father into the same profession, his goals are unique; to uphold the law without having to bend or break it. And yet, his good aspiration are certainly out of place in the corrupt organization of the police of that time. He slowly becomes drawn into the graft. He becomes glory-hungry, pulling whatever strings he has to in order to be promoted or be seen in a good light by the press. And yet, he does begin to find himself giving into exactly the cause he fought against. And so, throughout the film, he struggles to overcome the instinctive nature of man to achieve power and glory. He has to be a better man than that. And so, the audience can quickly see the nobility in that. He is not perfect. But at least he tries to be.   And probably the best performance in the film comes from Spacey. Here we see what Exley might have become in a few years if he wasn't careful.  Jack Vincennes has succumb to the call of money and celebrity status. He does not care in the least about duty or about justice. It's all become simply a matter of vanity. And yet, he begins to see through his own fault. Spacey's performance is undoubtable the best, because he is one of those actors who doesn't have to try to communicate his emotions in order to communicate them (or, at least, he is good enough not to show the strings). I had to watch this film several times to really take in the impact of his role, and fully absorb his character. His key moments within the middle of the film are absolutely unforgettable. When he stares into the mirror of the bar after receiving the hundred dollar bill, that scene is a turning point for the character. And he was able to convey the message of that scene without saying a thing. And also, when asked why he became a cop, the delivery of that next line, just that, was Oscar worthy on its own.   Even aside from those three performances, it would have been totally respectable if James Cromwell or Danny DeVito  had received a nomination. Truly, this film had one of the greatest ensemble casts ever captured on screen.",L.A. Confidential
385,zach-27,"Great story, wonderful direction, outstanding acting",10,1 September 1999,"One of the most pleasant surprises I have ever experienced at the movies was the viewing of this film.  Unfortunately, when it was first released in 1997, very little fanfare accompanied its debut.  Almost no one went to see it, or even heard of it.  However, when the year-end critical acclaim poured in, this film was right at the forefront, collecting a trunkload of best film and best screenplay prizes.  Although ""Titanic"" won the 1997 Best Picture Oscar, ""L.A. Confidential's"" two Oscars (best supporting actress, best screenplay adaptation) stand as undeniable proof of its great story, wonderful direction, and outstanding acting.

Crowe's performance was, I think vastly underappreciated--he makes his character's animalistic ferocity something terrible to behold. Pearce is solid, Spacey is great as always, and Cromwell was terrific. Danny DeVito provides some comic relief. And of course, Basinger was beautiful, in a role perhaps somewhat overrated.

Kim Basinger doesn't resemble Veronica Lake and how she won an Oscar is still a question for the ages. I found myself tolerating the film more than enjoying it, although there are a few scenes which do deliver some memorable images and dialogue. I suppose the biggest disappointment for me was the unnecessary, even offensive Political Correctness which this film uses when referring to groups of people and certain human behavior; bowdlerizing Ellroy's GREAT novel is not the way to do it.

After seeing it, I simply shrugged. I thought it was very boring and I didn't think Kim Basinger was that great. Although I liked Crowe and Spacey in this, I didn't like any of the others like Divito and Guy Pearce. After all the oscar stuff, I even saw it again and still nothing.
To this day I still can't think what is so great about it or remember any scenes that really stick out. It reminds me of another really dumb and idiotic movie called Forrest Gump. I am glad Titanic beat this pile of rubbish.0/10",L.A. Confidential

391,varun-mentor,Hollywood at its brightest!,9,20 June 2010,"I once rented a pile of movies to watch more than a decade ago maybe when I was in very early teenage. And I am really glad I finally watched that last one from that pile today which at that time I thought was some passable flick. And thankfully more glad because I watched it after Scorsese's masterpiece Departed.Because that way I have the best of both the times. And no comparisons as such could suffice the praise I have for L A Confidential. Movie starts with regular charm any mega movie holds and carries it to sparkling sea of reactions throughout the movie right from goosebumps to a bit of chuckle, nerve wrecking dialogues and masterful performances.And Russell crowe comes to the fore again and again and again (sans Maximus, John Nash, Jim braddock, Ef Hoffman, Jeff Wigand the list is endless). And after all those performances I have seen (although not periodically correct) this truly stands out right next to Maximus for a powerful performance that moves the core inside you. Stands next to him is the topsy turvy Guy Pearce with his grey shaded character which actually make you curse and finally like him in the end. Kim basinger deservedly did a supporting actress performance. Rest of the cast and obviously the most brilliant as a character and an actor Spacey couldn't have made this one into a Hollywood Masterpiece.I wouldn't rewind the story but special mention to the striking dialogues and especially the confessions scene where you can feel yourself breaking the chair Bud is holding and grabbing the goon with his collar thumping him over against the wall and getting the truth outta him. Superb cinema and I wonder what made Curtis Hanson stop right there to continue in the lines of Scorsese who never tends to lose the steam.Overall compelling drama and a MUST watch for real drama lovers, do watch it with no sense of story line and will surprise you at every corner right till the last statement!!! 9/10",L.A.

Fallen so much that even the REAL Lana Turner was suspiciously looked at to be a look-alike. (ii) The relation between White and Bracken was not required'--- Bracken is the one who inspires White to change himself from a bull-dozer to a microscope and White then starts working more intelligently and less physically on an individual case of his which latter provides him a big breakthrough.

And that is a weak thread in the script.'--- Exley, White and Vincennes were working in not three altogether different continents but in the same city called ... 'LA'. Each of them found a thread for three different cases to work on, that anyway, would eventually have finally brought them together on One Big Case. What has the event of Exley (visiting/not visiting) the hooker got to do with it? The scene is in the script just to showcase the nature of Bud White and hasten the union of White and Exley. (iv) Some people thought that the wrong officer gets the girl and hence the movie is bad.--- These people didn't like 'LA' merely because the girl goes to a brutal headstrong guy like White who they think is unworthy of the girl. Unbelievable! I hope these people do not take 'film-criticism' as a career. Anyway, it's the choice of the female who she goes out with and no male can enforce himself upon her else he is punishable by law. (v) Some people thought that Exley is supposed to be the face of Morality and he is shown to kill another officer -unnecessarily shooting him in the back which is wrong.--- Now this reason to justify that 'LAC' is a bad movie is ridiculous. 'LAC' is actually about the very process of gradual degradation of Exley as a cop. That's why Exley killed the Officer by the time the movie ends.(vi) Some people thought White was not required to account for his murder of the TV-watching black guy which is a flaw in the movie.--- A cop killing someone in self-defense is NOT guilty. In order to prove that he just defended himself, White shoots a bullet from the black guy's line of fire towards the door to set up that he (White) was attacked.(vii) Finally some people thought that this movie is so highly rated because of younger viewers like the lure of sex and violence regardless of quality. --- Ridiculous. Do only young guys watch movies and rate them ? AND are most of the young guys irresponsible in life ? I doubt heavily.And this one... (vii) Some people thought it is one of those movies where everyone dies instantly from one gunshot except the main characters who get shot multiple times and take forever to die, if they do at all.--- What is trivial and non-vital to the cause of carrying the plot forward should be wrapped as early as possible. Which characters gets how many bullets to die is not at all important. But some particular characters who get shot multiple times and still live which is just to dramatically depict the grittiness, stubbornness of the nature of their character.And Lastly,... Kim Bassinger deserved the Oscar she won. Now don't ask me 'Why?'.By the way, this masterpiece was robbed of the Best Picture Win and some acting nominations as well. A perfect 10 on 10 from me.",L.A. Confidential

Kevin Spacey too gives a performance which warrants his being taken more seriously in the future - his demise is one of the high points containing as it does the clue that leads to the denouement so pay attention as it happens because it is a shocker. And what can one say about Kim Basinger - she even made me forget that she was playing a very sophisticated form of call girl.

398,pratyush-03848,A treat for Neo-Noir fans,9,16 September 2016,"L.A. Confidential is a must watch for those out there who are fans of mystery, crime or neo-noir. The story keeps you on the edge of the seat guessing what each character's next step is and what it will lead to. This film has all the elements to make it a gripping noir film: scandal, femme-fatales, sleazy officials and double- crossing. In this film, three police officers for the L.A.P.D. are assigned to investigate a series of murders in the city. The cops are completely different in the outlook on life and have their own motives. How these three cops come to investigate the murders forms the basis of the story. As far as the performances go, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe are phenomenal in their Hollywood Debuts. At the time, these 2 were relative unknowns in Hollywood as they were only know in Australia and New Zealand. Kevin Spacey is equally impressive in his role but plays a more supporting character to both Pearce and Crowe. Kim Basinger as Lynn Bracken and keeps you glued to the screen. Overall, this film is a must watch for all noir film fans out there. It will keep you guessing what happens next and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Don't miss out.",L.A. Confidential

'L.A. Confidential' is a masterpiece. Simply stunning, full of double whammies, and many twists and turns. Every actor in this film is so Oscar worthy. This is what makes 'L.A. Confidential' so undeniable.This film is one that I can have so many compliments for including Kim Basinger who looked so devastatingly beautiful and undeniable as a Veronica Lake-ish call girl (she nabbed the Best Supporting Actress Oscar of 1997). The three lead characters played by Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Spacey should have been nominated Oscars as well. If it was between them, I'd give the award to Kevin Spacey for his undeniable charm as the most famous cop in L.A. Sergeant Jack Vincennes. The cinematography, set decoration is damn good. They filmed in old neighborhood's in L.A. so it would look as if you felt you were in the 50's. It worked out. The only set that was really actually a survivor of the 50's era is the Frolic Cocktail club.This film is set like the tradition of Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown.' I find the tradition the director Curtis Hanson did is much better. He acquired a great music score from Jerry Goldsmith and he even chose the old Chet Baker, Jerry Mulligan, and Dean Martin songs before writing the script. This is Curtis Hanson's best work of all. I recommend this film to everyone. You can't say no to this film. Their is a lot of hard work here if you can see. Speaking of which this film is based on the James Ellroy novel and when I read it, I was very impressed. It was certainly a great idea to adapt it into a script. I love this film. One of my 10 favorites. 10/10",L.A. Confidential

Shame it didn't took more Oscars from the overrated ""Titanic"". Best film of the year.",L.A. Confidential
401,Mourn-2,Screenplay of the Decade,10,7 December 1998,"The acting in the movie was nearly perfect, especially with respect to the trio of cops the film centers around.  The only reason I can see for the Oscar snub was that it was difficult to choose between them.  Spacey was awesome as he always is, but my choice would have been Crowe by a nose. But, what really sets this movie apart is the screenplay.  The dialogue is realistic and appropriate for the time.  The pacing is perfect, a rare feat for a movie significantly over two hours.  And the plot is intricate, yet decipherable if the viewer pays attention.  The audience is not insulted with constant explanations and pointers to the key moments, but the audience is also not confused by screenplay that loses itself in its own attempts to remain interesting and suspenseful.  The story unfolds like a perfect novel.  This is definitely the screenplay of the 90's, if not the film of the 90's.  Handing Cameron the Oscar for his over-budgeted, self-indulgent, poorly-acted waste of a good three hours was the crime of the 90's.",L.A. Confidential

I definitely rank it up there with ""The Usual Suspects"".The casting was perfect, and the acting exceptional.  Kevin Spacey as usual did a wonderful job.  Keep an eye on Russell Crowe -- this was the first movie I saw him in and I knew talent and presence when I saw it.  Guy Pierce also did a bang-up job.  All of them deserved Oscar nominations. If you've ever read the book (and I have) you'll have the utmost respect for the adaptation of the 500 page to me to a tightly written 2 1/2 hrs.  Few movies improve on the book, this is one of them.Much can also be said about the excellent use of period music to set the tone, as well as the great period sets and clothes.

I thought it was well written, directed and acted, and of course it's visually stunning. After reading the book I was even more impressed by it - amazing that someone actually managed to put together such a great film out of a very complex novel. Sure, some of the storylines and characters were left out, and it's not as dark, but the movie stays true to the spirit and atmosphere of its source. The casting was superb, and the entire ensemble is excellent, with Crowe, and obviously Spacey, the best of the bunch. I've since recommended it to many of my friends, all of whom really liked it. The best movie of 1997, and against some very good competition.",L.A. Confidential
404,jkebttn71,"cool, concise and brilliantly crafted",10,9 March 2009,"This is one of my favourite films of all time; the best detective movie ever! Russel crowe, Kevin spacey and James Cromwell play the coolest cops ever and Guy Pearce does an equally fantastic job as the uptight 'to the book' cop. The film starts off by showing each of the cops specific techniques of dealing with problems; Bud white (Crowe) has a major dislike for women abusers and believes they should be punished severely. Ed Exley (Pearce)is an uptight man who wears glasses, very unpopular amongst the police. As the film is set in the 1950's at the time of rising film/ t.v. stars there is the 'commericial' cop; Jack vincennes (Spacey) perhaps the best character. And the Legendary James Cromwell as Lt.Dudley Smith the boss, I won't say more. After a mass shooting in a diner (the nite owl) possible leads shoot off in every direction as the 3 detectives search for the rest of the pieces to the puzzle. As the story builds a look a like call girl (Kim Basinger) falls into the plot and so too does talkative press man and friend of Jack vincennes (Danny Devito, who also narrates). The screenplay has both clever plot twists and; flash dialogue, characters and setting. The plot twists and characterisation is on par with the usual suspects but with one difference; L.A. confidential is always; 'Off the record, on the QT and very Hush Hush'",L.A. Confidential

James Cromwell put in a good performance. Russell Crowe was brilliant. However, my two favourite performances came from Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey, who once again have displayed how they got where they are. Kim Basinger was okay, but I felt that out of all the cast, her performance was the weakest, and don't know why she got an Oscar and no one else in the cast was even nominated.Basically, this film is a work of art.

408,GloreMag,Sex...drugs...and dodgy Irish accents but oh well!,8,10 February 2010,"L.A Confidential is a very impressive film. It has style, flow and a strong plot, not to mention, an extremely enviable assembled cast. The film is not perfect, of course, it is extremely difficult if not impossible for a film past or present to be described as ""perfect.""The movie tells the story of three very different detectives in a Hollywood soaked in sleaze and scandal. Although possessing starkly contrasting personalities, the three detectives have one very important thing in common; an unquenchable thirst for the truth. In addition to differing personalities, the three protagonists employ very different techniques in order to attain the coveted truth. Lieutenant Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), fuels a wave of disdain amongst his colleagues thanks to his sell-out approach all part of a relentless pursuit to get ahead. On the other hand, Bud White (Russell Crowe) displays great episodes of rage towards suspects etc... in order to ""beat"" the truth out of them. One of the films most interesting motifs is Detective White's constant struggle to control is ever-growing and virtually over-whelming feelings of rage. Last but by no means least, we have Detective Frank Vincennes (Kevin Spacey). Portrayed as a man with style, suave and elegance but at the same time, an admirable determination to be the best. He collaborates regularly with Hush-hush magazine editor Sid Hudgeons (De Vito) and attempt to throw Bud White of-course as he exploits his White's most glaring weakness, his lack of control for violence.The three detectives become engrossed in a desperate hunt to find the culprits of a multiple murder which occurred at the Nite Owl coffee shop.Captain Dudley Smith (James Cromewell) is responsible for some good acting, a convincing portrayal of a well-respected yet ultimately sleaze-ball of an LAPD captain, and an utterly dreadful Irish accent. Being from Ireland, it is disconcerting and frustrating to see great actors make an absolute balls of Irish accents. Daniel-Day Lewis was acceptable in ""The Name Of The Father"" but apart from that, Hollywood need to seriously work on their Irish accents as it is exceptionally poor.Anyway, the film arouses a lot of interesting concepts. It is captivating in the sense that it provokes questions of who will successfully unravel the murder mystery first. The film, in a way also, let's you feel differently towards the three detectives. Personally, I hated Ed Exley, which I would believe is a very shared emotion amongst other viewers of this films and I routed for Jack Vincennes despite his scandalous and rule-bending associations with Sid Hudgeons.Ignoring my physical disaffection's for Kim Basinger (I don't find her attractive partly thanks to all the hype I heard), she was impressive as the celebrity look-alike prostitute Lynn Bracken.Overall, the film has very few flaws. Referring back to Cromwell's amusingly poor Irish accent of course, but it also inconsistent in it's pace and although the ending ties up all the loose-knots, it loses it's sense of style and sophistication with a mindless shoot-out. Feel free to disagree though, that's just the way I felt when I was watching it.However, the pro's undoubtedly outweigh the con's in this neo-noir feature. The fact that IS neo-noir does make it enjoyable and a welcome change to the usual cinematography of blockbusters that are dominating the big screen. The acting is also great. The characters are interesting, scandalous and open to conflicting interpretations . I was impressed with Kevin Spacey as he is typically wonderful in his portrayal of Vincennes. Despite this, I was particularly impressed with Pearce as Exley as does a great job in making us HATE his guts but eventually splendour in his triumph. Along with this, the dialogue and chemistry is hard-worked and well adapted, as you'd expect from its Oscar nod for Adapted Screenplay.Overall, a very enjoyable watch that engages and sustains the viewers interest throughout. 8/10",L.A.

Based on a marvellous novel by the great James Ellroy, this film establishes an incredibly convincing atmosphere and environment which in itself is an achievement. But this film doesn´t stop with that, like many other 40´s gangster-films do. It dives deep, deep down into the sharply drawn characters and tells an entertaining and dark story which would have been impressive enough without the Hollywood-glamour that surrounds it.

414,sexyrebl,What a Classic!!,10,4 December 1998,"Curtis Hanson directed the 1997 nostalgic film ""L.A. Confidential"" and boy did he ever hit nail on the head with classic. This was probably one of the best acted films of 1997 (The Ice Storm and The Wings of the Dove were the others!!).  This film kept you in suspense throughout the whole movie.  It was too bad that this nostalgic masterpiece didn't get more recognition by the Academy for this piece of art. The acting was superb!  Guy Pearce should've been nominated for Best Actor for his role of a by-the-book cop who tries to crack a very complex case this role was a very big stretch for this Austrailian Actor.  Kevin Spacey once again shows us his talents with another spot-on performance and is probably the best character-actors of the 90's and was spotless in this movie!!  James Cromwell was every bit as good as he was in ""Babe"" by playing the villainous cop in this movie and was outstanding here in L.A Confiential.  Russel Crowe did an excellent job playing the role as a hot-tempered cop and should've been nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this movie!!  Of course, no L.A. Confidential critique would be fulfilled without talking about Kim Basinger's stylish and outstanding performace by playing the Lana Turner-like hooker Lyn Braken.  Kim Basinger deserved to win for her performace and after years of heartbreak for this talented actress she finally gets her crowning glory and it was a well-deserved win for her. I believe that this movie deserved the Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress and probably should've won more.  I believe that this movie was a work of art and Curtis Hanson got some well-deserved recognition for his wonderful work.  I would definitely recommend you rent this movie as soon as possible!!",L.A.

415,karma185,Awesome,9,17 April 1999,"I saw this movie on HBO because I thought nothing else was on. I was reluctant to see it because I usually don't watch cop movies. (I'm under 18, what can I say.  They don't market them for my age group) I couldn't have been more wrong. L.A. Confidential was awesome, very high on my list of good movies, because it was so well done.  The Los Angeles aspect was so distinct, which I appreciated even though I don't know anything about the 50s that isn't on Nick at Nite.  The acting was awesome too, enough that it should have been more recognized at the Oscars.  Everyone gives kudos to Spacey and he was great but I didn't consider him the main part of the film.  I thought that the acting of Guy Pearce and especially of Russell Crowe, stood out.  I thought Crowe had a stronger prescence then Pearce, but they were both good and I really wish that this movie would have been a jumping off point for their careers.  I really want to see more of them! Basinger was good too, worthy of her awards and worthy of a comeback.  I don't think this role was cliche for her because this time she played a blond with intelligence and motives and dimension. The script was great, with a few things that disturbed me and I accepted as part of the story.  The racism, characteristic of that era, and the corruption were effective enough to make me yell at the T.V. I thought people were kicking in doors too much, and shooting first/asking questions later. Lastly, the soundtrack was awesome.  The jazz sounds that played continuously throughout the film accented the story the way a soundtrack is supposed too. Many people compare this movie to films like CHINATOWN. I can't offer the same comparison because I haven't seen CHINATOWN and I don't know what it's about. But I think L.A. Confidential is a great movie without attaching it to a genre.  It's a great movie ""in itself.""",L.A. Confidential
416,Jamal C.,...in a word...OUTSTANDING,10,18 October 1999,"This is an amazing movie. First of all the cast, Kevin Spacey is one of the great actors of our time, and Danny DeVito is also a great actor. They play each part perfectly.      One thing that makes this movie interesting characters and how very different they are. Danny DeVito's character Sid Hudgens the tabloid reporter is very interesting to watch. He just plays him so well, you would think he really is a tabloid reporter. Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, Russel Crowe, and Guy Pierce also have very interesting characters.
     Basically, there are these 3 cops, with their own unique opinion of what justice is. They are constantly conflicting with each other until one of them crosses the line... ratting on a fellow officer. Meanwhile, mob boss Mickey Cohen is imprisoned. But organized crime is still very much around. And in their spare time they are working on this case, along with a truck load of suspicious characters. And in a nearby cafe massicre. A well known friend and fellow officer is killed. Coincidence? I think not. Thats enough for now, i'll leave you itching to see the movie. The main thing about this movie that was intrigeing is the complex plot. It gives you many sub-plots to handle in the beginning of the movie and they all seem to come together (in an utterly amazing way!) by the end.
     To me, corruption in anything makes me want to see that movie, you will never figure this one out, at least not until the near end of the movie. It was brilliantly acted by Kim Basinger who definitely deserved that award.     I love a movie that makes me think, and this one REALLY makes me think. I also like a well written script to confuse me at first, but then make a lot of sense to me, getting me really involved in the movie. When you see this one in the video store, don't pass it by, rent it! Trust me it is truly an amazing movie.",L.A. Confidential
417,Borboletta,Great 50s style noir classic,10,19 July 2001,"What a breath of fresh air this movie was...for a change, we've got a Hollywood film that challenges the audience to keep up with it while delivering great suspense and great performances. I was reminded of the way the pieces finally came together towards the end of other classics in the genre like Chinatown, the Big Sleep and Kiss Me Deadly. Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce, two Aussies, show just what they can do when dealt a good script. Kevin Spacey and James Cromwell also rocked the house, my only complaint is the Kim Basinger's on-screen time was rather limited considering that she won the Oscar.",L.A. Confidential
418,Rockford_6,On of the best movies,9,14 August 2008,"When you look back at it and see that Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce actually appeared in the same film back in 97 then you wouldn't have believed it since they have all gone on to better things but before that we had L.A. Confidential which was Crowe's and Pearce's ticket into Hollywood. Spacey had already made it with his Best Supporting Actor nod for The Usual Suspects but what puzzles me is how everybody apart from Kim Basinger didn't get any acting nominations at the Oscars. James Cromwell is the most chilled out villain you'll ever going to see in a film like this and has been criminally ignored by the Academy. Curtis Hanson was also someone who had made some good films but no masterpieces till this came along. They all must have sold their souls to make this because when you get big cast get together to make a Hollywood film then you become a bit intrigued by it because if the cast is big then is the story any good? In L.A. Confidential's case it had both and a lot more to say the least.",L.A. Confidential
419,redzon19,"Rollo Tomasi, do you still remember?",10,2 March 2011,"""Rollo Tomasi"" is a name that anyone had seen this movie should remember for the rest of his life or at least be aware of the existence of the name, because this is the key to the spirit of this whole story. Due to the setting of this clue, there is no doubt one great movie had become a classic! As a Taiwanese, I saw a lot of Hong Kong movies about police and gangsters while I was a child, and they were all very impressive. Therefore, the particularly genre has been promoted to such high levels in my mind that I can hardly be pleased. Fortunately, ""L.A. Confidential"" satisfies me not only with its thoughtful scenario, but also with several great actors' performances. More specifically, the story is not just about justice versus evil, there are also many elements such as passion, wisdom, greed, friendship and of course love which all made this movie more than fun to watch. In other words, you might feel angry at this moment, shocked latter, and finally moved by their insistence on doing the right things which made us believe there are still several police worth our trust.Guy Pearce was one big surprise in the movie not because he played the leading role of the movie, but for his courage and wisdom, and most important of all, his slightly pride that caused admiration accompanied by hostility at the same time. Because the complexity he showed, we couldn't help but be deeply attracted, and that's when we built connections with the character inside the frame. Secondly, Kevin Spacey was not the one who would gain our trust at first, but no one ought to disagree with his contribution after the shocked ""Rollo Tomasi"" scene. Likewise, Russell Crowe twisted his role impressions only after his cooperation with Guy Pearce, but he really needed to adjust his tempers for his own sake. Such a crew made this great movie never out-of-date, not even after similar stories keep brainwashing our minds.How lucky I am to see such a classical film. As a matter of fact, I haven't found one movie that reaches the same level as it did, at least not in the genre. Thus, I just have to repeat watching the film again and again, and I believe many people are doing the same thing I do.",L.A. Confidential
420,aeloen,An intricate tale of conspiracy and corruption.,10,17 May 2003,"Spoilers Possible.LA Confidential was everything I didn't expect it to be. I'm not overly sure what my expectations were, but whatever they were, they were thrown right out of the water and entangled in the roots of a very clever film.
Three cops investigate a homicide in their own unique ways, which ultimately land them on the same path of turning the corrupt establishment on it's head and revealing the truth.Often, in films, you can see things coming: with this film, I was incredibly shocked when the police Captain reveals his true colours. And this is what LA Confidential does so well: suprises, shocks and keeps you on your toes right up to the last few minutes of the film.A startingly good film, one to watch. 10/10",L.A. Confidential
421,jim-862,"The trappings, but not the substance of greatness",6,11 August 2005,"This film gets a six from me, largely because of the very strong acting by everyone.The story...is a cardboard sham of story, a ""Chinatown"" wannabe, that has unsatisfactory twists and turns, painfully slow beginnings, and ridiculously stereotyped tinging. The heavy hand of ""period feel"" is everywhere, a reek of over-exertion to make it ""sound"" right, ""look"" right. But, it ""isn't"" right.A personal yutz of mine is Dudley Smith's referral in a press conference to ""DMV"". Small point perhaps, but I doubt you can return to that period and find one reference in any publication to DMV as an acronym for Division of Motor Vehicles. In a desire to ""make it feel real"", I think, they all forgot to ""keep it real.""Screenwriter Helgeland credits include Conspiracy Theory, Bloodwork, this film, A Knight's Tale, Payback, The Postman, Mystic River, and Man on Fire. Mostly good, but you can't win them all. But his purposed use of the ""F"" bomb over and over again, is, for me, out of bounds, for there is no added dramatic affect from it, and, while certainly used back in that period, wasn't used like we hear it used. Also, the constant referral to ""whores cut to look like film stars"", followed by the somewhat humorous Lana Turner gag was, for me, a huge nothing. So what? The angle that was interesting is the BLACKMAIL (which connects immediately to the DeVito character), the GANGLAND rubouts, and, of course, the MISSING HEROIN. The plastic surgery angle is a total zero. Bud White's oh, so predictable relationship with the Madam, and the Exley character's pursuit of her was unsupportable and doesn't come off. But, it has to be there, or else the Beefeater Bud White won't see red enough to accept the truth about Exley-Vincennes' findings.Chinatown is one of the best examples of a period film that seems to have got it right. Perhaps because writer Robert Towne's father-in-law was actor John Payne, who acted in Noir Films under the direction of Phil Karlson (Kansas City Confidential, for one). And, then, too, there was world-class director Roman Polanski to steer the course, who was, at that time, on top of his game and not yet a convicted sex-offender.Direction in L.A. Confidential is not obvious, and it could have used some. This film wants strong direction, needed to cut out the fat in this screenplay, which I think was about 20 minutes of unnecessary scenes that add nothing to the plot or suspense of the finale.Six. Not one for the ages, but, again, memorable performances throughout.",L.A. Confidential
422,amandaroseobrien84,One of the Best Modern Noir Films Ever,10,5 January 2013,"This is a movie that is pretty much made for me. It's a film noir with cursing and realistic violence! People wearing 50s clothing and sex! I really don't know why modern film noir hasn't become more of a thing. Every couple of years one comes out and everyone goes crazy for it but it never really takes off. This films has one of the best ensemble casts ever. Every character is fully formed and could carry their own movie. This film was the big break for both Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce, won Kim Basinger a Best Supporting Actress Oscar, and features on the of best death scenes ever, but for more about that, check out my review http://amandalovesmovies.com/2012/02/28/l-a-confidential/.",L.A.

423,mediapeertime,Awesome Character Piece,9,15 September 2013,"A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.",L.A. Confidential

The acting is incredible for a virtually unknown cast, aside from Spacey and Basinger, and the story is almost perfect!  The writing and directing are almost flawless and the best thing about the movie:  The art direction.  It was so perfect! The whole time I was watching, I actually thought it was 1953.  It absolutely blew my mind. Aside from the violence in some scenes, and some choice words in others, the film is almost for all ages.  And anyone who likes a good mystery would enjoy such an intriguing piece of filmwork!! It is truly masterful and I think that it should have beat Titanic based on the acting alone!!",L.A.

426,kristina-11,Gripping and suspenseful return to film noir,10,19 October 1999,"Robbed of the Academy Award by the insipid Titanic, this is the film that people will praise and remember ten years from now.LA Confidential boasts one of the finest casts imaginable. Russell Crowe proves his worth as hard-as-nails cop with a soft spot for battered women. James Cromwell demonstrates that he can play a shady police captain as well as a kind-hearted farmer (Babe). Kevin Spacey shines as Hollywood Jack Vincennes, a schemer who has an attack of conscience and David Straitharn's performance as a pimp who has his girls cut to look like movie actresses testifies to the fact that he is one of the most underrated actors in the business. While Kim Basinger puts on a good show as call girl/Veronica Lake lookalike Lynn Bracken, she is the least convincing of the cast. The actors were so superb that they split the votes come Oscar time and none of them were nominated.What Brian Helgeland does with James Ellroy's novel is masterful. He takes a thick novel full of characters and plot twists and is able to condense it to a mere two and a half hours, still capturing the essence of the work. LA Confidential film afficionados would do well to read Ellroy's novel, as some of the film's more underdeveloped characters (Jack Vincennes, Exley's undead father!) are described in more detail.Please do yourself a favor and BUY, not rent, this masterpiece. It deserves several viewings and it is a great addition to any movie buff's collection.",L.A. Confidential

The screenplay it's a fountain of thriller, action, drama, crime and a little bit of humour. The screenplay is one of the best of the history, in my own opinion. The acting: in two words: ""Stellar"" & ""Spectacular"".-Kim Basinger. Kim Basinger makes her best performance in her career. The academy gives to her the Oscar (It was a crime if they didn't gave it to her!). In this film she is very attractive. Posibilly, the best performance of the film. Absolutely wonderful.-Kevin Spacey. Kevin Spacey it's a fantastic actor in the most part of his films. In that he did it again. Good acting. But his best is in ""Usual Suspects"" & ""American Beauty"", of course!-Russell Crowe. With a lot of power! Russell Crowe makes another great performance. He plays his role with a lot of power, emotion and credibility. VERY GOOD,VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD Russell!-Guy Pearce. He plays his role good. It's not fantastic but good. -Danny DeVito. Danny does it very good. He is funny. It's a example of a very well performance. Brilliant!-James Cromwell. He wants to ""fuck"" the rest of the people of L.A. He does a fantastic role. The other people that appears in the film, are also almost perfect.The score is amazing. Have a lot of of great themes. The cinematography or photography is...

428,plutokennedy,"Decent movie, lousy adaptation",3,3 December 2004,"'LA Confidential' the movie has very little in common with Ellroy's book. The plot has been altered, the character's motivation has changed and a Hollywood ending has been tacked on. A very intriguing story about passion, obsession and loyalty has been dumbed down to a level of an ordinary TV cop show. Screenwriter Helgeland did even worse things to Michael Connelly's 'Blood Work', but I am still shocked that this adaptation Ellroy's book won an Oscar. Still, the movie has great performances, good direction, but lacks a decent plot, character development and suspense. If you liked the movie, do yourself a favor and read Ellroy's novel. You'll be amazed how mercilessly the book was butchered. This could have been a great movie if the makers would realize that not everybody has the attention span of a goldfish and that some people can actually follow a complicated plot. Lad, grand it ain't!",L.A. Confidential
429,spodvoll,Classic Noir!,10,29 December 2003,"Pay full attention to this flick, and be fully rewarded.  The director didn't waste a single frame.  Brilliant exposition, development and resolution of a very noir theme, full of style and substance.  I consider this one of the finest films of the '90s, perhaps even underrated by the critics and the Academy.  Spacey, Pearce, Crowe, Bassigner, Cromwell, and DeVito comprise perhaps the finest ensemble cast since ""The Right Stuff"". They all deserve awards.  The screenplay and direction serve the book remarkably well, IMHO the best adaptation of a book since, ""The Godfather""!",L.A. Confidential
430,Chris_BS1212,One of the best crime films of the 90s,8,25 April 2010,"L.A Confidential is a film full with great performances as one might well expect from such a brilliant ensemble cast. Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe are all terrific as three very different L.A. cops. Exley (Pearce) is the college graduate who truly believes in doing good and that there is a right way to act as a police officer, Vincennes (Spacey) is almost a celebrity cop with a job as an adviser on a fictional TV cop show and an arrangement with Sid Hudgens (Danny De Vito)of Hush-Hush magazine who will frequently be there to take pictures of Vincennes arresting a film star for drug possession. Finally there is Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is the tough guy, who gets his results by strong arming suspects.Director Curtis Hanson recreates 1940s Los Angeles very believably and the film is consistently well shot. Its pacing is also pitch perfect, there is hardly a line wasted, every scene moves the plot along. To say that Hanson paces the film perfectly is no small complement, having adapted the story from a fairly long novel by James Ellroy which has a complex plot with many characters and yet after just over two hours the film ends and there is no sense that anything has been left out or that the film is anyway incomplete. L.A. Confidential will hold your attention from start to finish.The plot itself has some basis in real events such as the acts of police brutality in the holding cells on Christmas Eve and the murders of a group of people at the Nite Owl. To say any more about the story would be to spoil it but suffice to say you'd do really well to see where it's going.The characters of the three police officers all undergo some transformation as the film progresses and all three actors handle it brilliantly with special kudos going to Pearce in the main role as Exley learns a great many tough lessons, including some about himself. No review of this film would be complete without at least a mention of Kim Basinger's performance, she easily holds her own in her scenes with Crowe and Pearce and that Oscar is well deserved.",L.A. Confidential
431,prustage95,Great film spoilt by poor sound management.,8,18 March 2017,"I am going to concur with the other glowing reviews here and say that this is an excellent film that deserves the high reputation its has. Except for one aspect - sound design and management. Much has been said about the recent trend to balance dialogue with other sound tracks badly but this film really is the worst I have come across. Dialogue and music are fairly well balanced and work well together but any on-screen violence causes the volume to be cranked up to ear splitting and totally unnatural levels. Gunshots, fist fights and even door slams are unacceptably louder than the dialogue and music levels and in a domestic viewing environment this means the finger has to be constantly on the volume control to compensate. I see no reason for this other than shock value. Unfortunately the shock effect wears out very quickly and we are left with something that is crude, annoying and badly thought out. Pity, because everything else about this film is brilliant.",L.A. Confidential
432,crell54,fantastic,9,6 January 2006,"this is one of the best crime movies i have ever seen. Danny Devito is wonderful as a sleezy tabloid reporter, and his performance and character just echo what the modern day PAPARAZZI are like. KEVIN SPACEY didn't fail to impress, ( as always) and kim basinger is wonderful as a whore who was supposed to look like veronica lake, she didn't. she looked like kim basinger with blonde hair. how ever the show was stolen by JAMES CROMWELL and GUY PEARCE ( who has come along way since playing a drag queen) CROMWELL as the evil bad guy and boss of the L.A police, and i actually thought what a sh*t when he shot SPACEY. GUY PEARCE played ED EXLEY as cop who puts his own career before anyone and anything, and he played the character with total realism. Now I bet your all wondering about RUSSEL CROWE well. even though I am very critical of him, his overall prowess in this film was remarkable. a contradictory character who hates women beaters yet kicks the sh*t out of kim basinger when he finds out she has shagged GUY PEARCE. the naughty slapper.",L.A.

434,John Doe 316,One Of The Greatest Movies Ever!,10,14 August 2002,"I'd seen the end of this movie once, and I'd seen the start another time, but I'd never watched the whole thing from beginning to end.  Last night I finally did after buying it on DVD.  I wasn't disappointed.The plot centres on three cops, Bud White (Crowe), Ed Exley (Pearce) and Jack Vincennes (Spacey) as they try to uncover the truth behind a mass murder incident at the Nite Owl diner.Jack Vincennes, known as Hollywood Jack, is the technical advisor for a hit TV police drama, and the closest thing to a celebrity in the LAPD.  He receives bribes to arrest celebrities while crooked photographer Sid Hudgeons (DeVito) takes their photo for Hush-Hush, his sleazy tabloid dirtsheet.  Kevin Spacey is perfect in the role, cool and slick on the exterior, yet showing Jack's hidden self-loathing perfectly.Bud White is an officer who is a success in the LAPD for brawn more than brains, often resorting to violence.  He has a deep hatred for woman-beaters due to the fact that his father abused his mother.  He is a loose cannon who appears set to go off at any given time.  Forget Gladiator, this is Russell Crowe at his career best.Guy Pearce is equally mesmerising in his performance as LAPD golden-boy Ed Exley.  We dislike him enormously at first, when he snitches on all his partners and becomes despised within the force.  However, he rises to the role of protaganist as the unforgettable climax looms closer.James Cromwell impresses in the thankless role of Captain Dudley Smith, the Chief Of Detectives who acts as a father-figure of sorts to Exley and White. It's not until the last hour or so that we can really appreciate Cromwell's performance.  Danny Devito is suitably slimy as Sid Hudgeons, hte sleazy tabloid reporter. Devito's stature really adds to that poison dwarf character of Hudgeons, and even his voice is perfect.Ironically, Kim Basigner, the only one of the six to get recognised with an Oscar, impresses least.  She plays Lynn Bracken, a prostitute in business solely because she looks like Veronica Lake.  It's not that she's bad that she impresses least, it's just because everybody else is so good.Overall, this movie is a masterpiece, and while Jack Nicholson deserved the Oscar for Best Actor in 1997, no way in hell did ""Titanic"" deserve Best Movie when LA Confidential was nominated.  It might be quite daunting with its labyrinthine plot, and imposing length, but don't let that put you off. This is one of those movies that I think everyone has to see.10/10",L.A. Confidential
435,movieman_stl,Then don't be a detective,10,2 May 2003,"Spoilers in:From the word go, there is always something going on.  Fights, murders, the action never stops with a big shootout finish.  Good screenplay and direction, making sure no scene is dull.  Where the film really shines is in its acting.  Spacey deserved his best supporting actor win but Kim Basinger's performance, though great, didn't seem enough for her oscar win. Crowe, Cromwell, DeVito, and Pearce give good performances as well.  Its interesting watching the character development unfold in all of them. Spacey as a corrupt cop who gets shot trying to be honest on a case, Crowe, who planted evidence and assaulted suspects, softens up after getting shot and abusing his girlfriend.  The biggest transformation was Pearce.  Asked early on by his chief, he said he could not plant evidence or shoot suspects that could go free.  By the end, he pulls a shotgun on the guilty.  It is one of those rare films where everything works.",L.A. Confidential
436,dharbigt-28632,Polished but Flawed,6,5 May 2021,"Plot: 6 (Somewhat predictable)
Diction: 7 (Lots of unrealistic but well-written dialogue)
Character: 5 (Formulaic and two-dimensional)
Extension: 4 (Quite a few unfortunate decisions)
Spectacle: 8 (Lots of good action and brawlin')
Overall: 6.0The most disappointing and distressing part of this movie is the irresponsible treatment of its primary theme. The impressions of justice contrasted between Bud White and Ed Exley are resolved in a most unsatisfactory manner.What I find most distressing is that the movie resolves the conflict by seemingly saying that both methods of law enforcement are equally valid. The question of whether either of them is wrong, the question of what happens when the innocent are wrongly punished is not only glazed over, but ignored. We have to labor under the assumption that every accused person is guilty, and that every guilty person deserves swift and ample punishment.Even when some Mexican prisoners are horribly beaten, in what seems like it should be one of the most powerful scenes in terms of its thematic implications, the issue is used as a vehicle for the focus on the each of the policemen's watered-down internal issues, which are all conveniently always rooted in something wrong that happened when he was a child.If the intention of this movie is to provide us with some solid cop-drama, why is it necessary to confuse and distract us with a half-assed treatment of its central theme?",L.A.

438,Buzz-17,Will stand the test of time.........,10,3 August 1998,"When a film evokes an era as well as L.A. Confidential does, people take notice. It could be argued that it is easier to replicate the recent past than the distant on film,  and in a sense this is true. Costumes, language, and the necessary absence of the modern in ""period pieces"" make them expensive and difficult to film. But couldn't it be argued that it is just as difficult to make a film about more recent periods? I have no knowledge of how a Victorian era table was set, or what a knight really spoke like; we are subject to the directors view of reality. But what if a good deal of your audience lived through the time you are portraying, as in the case of the 1950's? I can even envision my grandfather coming back from WW2 to a booming economy, and living in the world Curtis Hanson created.The real genus of this film is that it creates not only a physical world, but one with all the politics, corruption, racism and inequity of the time. As a result we feel the characters motivations and understand their faults all  the better; Bud White, Ed Exley, Lynn Bracken and Lana Turner all live here. This film, like others that make us believe we are there for two hours (and $7.50), will endure. I was thinking a  perfect double feature would be with Chinatown, another film that will stand the test of time.",L.A. Confidential
439,aash-2,Tip for the first-time viewer,10,12 October 2005,"This is a stunning movie, film noir at its finest. Fully developed characters, perfect soundtrack, and enough plot twists and turns to keep you guessing from one minute to the next. You'll absolutely feel taken back to post-war Hollywood, and all of the drugs, crime, sex, and stardom (in several senses of the word) that went along with it. If you haven't seen it, please take my advice and do the following: watch the DVD at home, where you can pause as needed for bathroom breaks, etc. The plot is so intricate in this movie that if you miss so much as one small scene, you'll never be able to recapture the thread. Don't be daunted - this is so wonderful and fun to watch, you won't WANT to miss a minute.",L.A. Confidential

441,James McK,"So good, it makes me jealous",10,20 May 2000,"When I watched L.A Confidential for the second time, my mouth just hung open. The first time I watched it, yes I enjoyed it, but it wasn't until the second viewing that its true brilliance sunk in. For the first time while viewing a movie I was actually jealous of the talent of the people who made it.Mainly because of the script, I'm sure one of the most complex storylines ever brought to film- a pretty nifty tale which comes together only when the viewpoints of three different police officers are joined together.This movie has some of the coolest shots and lighting I've ever seen, the pace is relentless and intense (how else could they fit the HUUUGE plot in) and the acting is just as hot as the script. And amongst all the action and plot twists we find ourselves understanding, and even heavily emoting for the characters, who hold together a wildly chaotic storyline. With the relationship between Russell Crowe and Kim Basingers's characters- it even has time to be touching.",L.A. Confidential
442,steventudor,Simply Perfect,10,13 January 2002,"Normally, no matter how good a film is, there are moments where you think (in that unqualified, ignorant arrogant way all film go-ers, whether ocassional or regular, have) ""I wouldn't have done it like that"", or ""that would have been better if they did this"".  I can't find a single moment like that in this film.  I walked out of the cinema with a feeling of elation I have never been able to match, and numerous re-watchings haven't dulled a moment of my enjoyment. The cast is perfect, inhabiting their roles with absolute conviction.  The plot is clever in an age where most Hollywood films are insultingly stupid. Marvelous.",L.A. Confidential
443,msrchuk,You can watch this again and again and it still holds up!,10,21 December 2004,"This is really one of my all-time favourites: it came up on TV the other night so I watched it again.The cast are exceptional: Russell Crowe is convincing as the psychotic but ultimately honest street cop; Guy Pearce is exactly nerdy enough; Kevin Spacey gives a note-perfect performance, and Kim Basinger was never better (or more beautiful). Danny De Vito effectively reprises his slime-ball act from Taxi (TV series), and the supporting players are consistently great.The plot is cleverly-constructed and paced, and it's not until relatively close to the end that you get the final twist. The test of a great film for me is that you don't realise you've been watching it for 2 hours, because you are completely involved in the story - this movie is one of those. It's really difficult to find something wrong with it, and frankly I don't want to because it's just so good.Thoroughly recommended (unless you're VERY squeamish)!",L.A. Confidential
444,jones-ben42,An All Around Fantastic Film,10,19 February 2011,"L.A. Confidential excels in every category of the spectrum: plot, acting, directing, dialogue, cinematography, and so on. It's a shame that this movie got screwed out of Best Picture in '97, and in its stead it won an award for a non-stand out performance from Kim Basinger. While I say it's a non-stand out to me, that's not to say it was bad because it was good, but when you're competing against the likes of Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell, it's hard to give her that kind of recognition.There was only one problem I really had with the film, but it wasn't against the film at all. I don't know if I was the only one to notice this, but I thought the people behind marketing this movie put too much emphasis on Kevin Spacey. Upon seeing the poster for the film, I was intrigued to see that one of my favorite actors, Kevin Spacey, was the leading man in the film, but he wasn't. It isn't too say that he didn't do a great job, but it's obvious that they listed his name first because he was the biggest name actor at the time. Spacey was fresh off of Se7en, and the Usual Suspects, which he won an Oscar for. His character is more of a major side character in my opinion, or the lowest of the main characters, with three or possibly four other characters filling bigger plot points in the film. This is just me nitpicking, but I thought that it was Ed Exley, Bud White, Captain Smith, and then Vincennes successively. Once again, this is purely nitpicking, but it's also purely speculation.The plot of this film is fairly complex and easily spoiled. First time watching this I was fairly lost, but no need to worry, Ed Exley gives you the full rundown at the end of the film. Without giving much away, the story takes place sometime in the mid 1900s in Los Angeles. It follows the story of the lies, deceit, and corruption within the city and its police department. The movie starts off with introducing us to Ed Exley and Bud White, two promising cops in their own ways; Exley is a by-the-book cop, doing whatever he can to serve justice while White is a brutal, dangerous cop who's willing to do whatever it takes to do what's right. The movie starts off by showing a distinction between two traits that people might think are interchangeable. The audience is meant to hate Exley early on because he decides to testify against other fellow cops when the entire station gangs up on some criminals who killed some other cops. White on the other hand seems to act on what he thinks is right, and tries to stop it at first, but then proceeds to initiate more beatings once a criminal makes a crack at White's mother. White is perceived as a good guy, who fights for just and humane reason, but Exley is perceived as a greedy capitalist who would sell his wife to the devil to get ahead. But as the film progresses, we meet more characters like Vincennes, Smith, and Bracken, and the story about the ""Night Owl Killings"" gets more and more complicated, the two characters seem to change from what they initially are written as, arcing into contradictions of the audiences original perception. The audience is made to sympathize with Exley once we learn about the motives of his decision to become a cop, in turn, making him less of a dick, and more of a guy who just was criminals behind bars. On the other hand, White becomes enraged once he learns a horrible secret (kind of would spoil film), and goes to see his girlfriend and beats her. This contradicts his former character, as someone who personally despises wife-beaters because of his backstory. Exley and White are such dynamic and interesting characters that they could each be the protagonist; however, if I had to pick one, I'd say it would be Exley because more events revolve around him in the movie and he's the one to rise in the climax, without giving anything away. All the other characters act as to support the crazy plot around them and they did a fabulous job.There was nothing I hated in the movie. It had a fascinating story with many intense plot twists that keep you guessing, memorable characters and dialogue, and great performances from these characters. Yeah I didn't say much about the movie itself, but this is one movie you need to see to believe. I highly recommend it, and would recommend multiple viewings to grasp all the plot angles.",L.A.

446,chrisgomez_01,"Well worth revisiting, but pay attention!",8,20 September 2011,"I watched this years ago, not long after it came out on DVD, and remember being bored by it despite its generally good reception.

The characters were interesting and complex, Kevin Spacey was a joy to watch as always, the film looked fantastic, and despite having a plot that took us around many twists and turns, it didn't take itself over-seriously.It moved along at a fair clip, however, and being quite slow at these things I did struggle to keep up occasionally. It was probably this that threw me off the first time around. The other side of that is that it's great to watch a film with a plot that you can really engage with.Overall, a great film to soak up when your brain is feeling hungry.",L.A. Confidential

I surely wasn't.This is a masterpiece, on all counts.The soundtrack, camera-work and settings are sublime and immerse the viewer so seamlessly that you actually feel as if you are being wrenched, uncomfortably, from it at the film's end.The plot is satisfactorily woven, which insists the viewer watches, intently, as you can be left behind.

452,steve_mclaughlin2,"Gritty, Real, Excellent Film",9,28 January 2014,"Three policemen, each with his own motives and obsessions, tackle the corruption surrounding an unsolved murder at a downtown Los Angeles coffee shop. Then things get interesting.So many great performances, should had gotten more Oscars. Crowe, Spacey, and Pearce deliver amazing performances. It's rare you get lost in the plot of a film, but this is one. It's easy to imagine you're in 1950's Los Angeles as the scenery, costumes, etc, are all spot on. The twists and turns as the movie rolls along are completely unexpected. Glitz, glamor, and the underside of Hollywood, great story. Summary: this is one of the greatest films ever, great work.",L.A. Confidential
453,Miazole,Not as good as I was hoping,7,19 April 2021,"I'm surprised more people don't take issue with its script. L. A. Confidential starts off excellent, albeit with a few writing flaws like not enough characters talking to the police with an attorney present, or when Exley pursues three escaped armed criminals with just one other officer.Unfortunately, typical Hollywood cliche finds its way into the plot a bit too often, like how Exley has the raging hormones of a pubescent teen, him and White rush into an obvious trap which results in the two of them outgunning a bunch of police officers, the police captain criminal mastermind takes part in the crimes himself unbelievably (there's no way he'd be there at the motel), and the plot really rushes along towards the end (and with the White-Bracken romance).I haven't read the book yet, but as a big fan of this genre (Chinatown is an all time favorite) I was disappointed by this kind of writing. For a 1950s period film, some may find its more contemporary look to be awkward as well. Nevertheless, it is worth a recommendation as it has its moments of brilliance as well as very good performances, but it could have been so much more.",L.A. Confidential
454,moisesalexramirez,The City of Angels has never felt so stylish,10,2 May 2016,"L.A Confidential is not only a superb achievement in filmmaking, it is a lesson on taking a fresh approach at a genre that could use a revival in contemporary narrative.This production tackles corruption, loyalty and treason in an elegant, yet aggressive and sophisticated manner; at times, it would seem to exhibit the essence of a Scorsese film (minus the profanity), and that can only be a good trait. There are many themes approached in this film, making it an appropriate choice for a very wide audience as it navigates through the world of the Los Angeles Police Department and the quirks of its members and some outsiders.The story is enthralling and developed diligently throughout the events from which it unfolds. The characters are all rather captivating and all act upon strong motivations. They are forced to be true to their nature at some points in the story, and to be someone else at others, which ultimately results in rich and complex characterizations. Acting is sensational from practically every corner, especially from the leads Spacey, Crowe and Pearce.The cinematography is just gorgeous, reflecting the beauty and the beast of L.A. The editing and the pace are quite polished and the dialogue feels very natural, which only compliments an already excellent cast and a direction worthy of nothing but praise.L.A. Confidential offers something for almost everyone, yet it offers everything for fans of the genre, and it does not disappoint in anything it attempts.",L.A. Confidential
455,Neve_Fan,"Good movie, could've been better",10,11 August 1998,"L.A. Confidential was your basic film noir.  The story was SO great.  And the characters are all so different...its what made the movie so interesting.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie.  It reminded me a LOT of Chinatown.  The acting was great in L.A. Confidential, but I think I would've liked the movie more if it had better dialogue, and more with Kim Bassinger.",L.A. Confidential
456,FROmo,Pure cinematic gold,10,1 March 1999,"L.A. Confidential is a pure triumph!  The best film Hollywood has produced in years.The acting is brilliant.  The standout is the always reliable Spacey here. Spacey is the greatest actor of the 90's (in my humble opinion).  He conveys so much in this film without saying anything. The direction, cinematography and music are perfect.  This is the best screenplay adaption made in the last 20 years!  Kudos to Curtis and Hanso to bringing this ""unadaptable book"" to the screen. The result is pure cinematic gold, which will stand the test of time.  This is how movies are supposed to be made.  The film is worhty, and stands right up at the same level as the classic ""Chinatown.""",L.A. Confidential
457,DiGiTs-2,Couldn't have made it any better.,10,10 April 1999,"Often when I'm watching movies, I'll say to myself during the course of the film ""this could have been so much better if the director only did _______.""I didn't do this at all when I first watched L.A. Confidential in a packed theater in Toronto. I must have seen it a half dozen times since then and I still haven't done it. I honestly can't see how Curtis Hanson (the most unlikely of all writer-directors) could have possibly created a more perfect film. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... ""Go back to Jersey...""), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. I mean, seriously, will society as a whole really benefit that greatly from another Home Alone movie? Or how about those ultra-lame teen-oriented comedies written by a bunch of married 30-somethings and staring a bunch of talentless 20-somethings? (the answer is no, by the way)L.A. Confidential is definitely one of the all time great film noirs, ranking with (if not surpassing) such other landmarks of the genre such as The Big Sleep, Chinatown & The Maltese Falcon.If nothing else (certainly not winning Academy Awards), L.A. Confidential proves that great films can still come out of Hollywood.",L.A. Confidential

One point made in one of the documentaries is how the director asked Kevin Spacey to play his character as Dean Martin....and with retrospect, he did!",L.A. Confidential
459,sportellos,"""This is the city of the angels, and you haven't got any wings.""",10,11 July 2009,"""This is the city of the angels, and you haven't got any wings."" It sounds like something out of a 1950's detective noir, but in fact it's just one of the many brilliant lines of dialog in Curtis Hanson's stunning detective drama ""L.A. Confidential"". Set in 1953, L.A. Confidential follows the stories (mainly) of three police officers: A sharp, straight laced, political animal, played by Guy Pearce, a violent brute with a hatred of women beaters, played by Russell Crowe, and a smooth talking, part time TV technical adviser, played by Kevin Spacey, all whom are giving A + performances. Other wonderful characters include Captain Dudley Smith, played by James Cromwell, and Veronica lookalike hooker Lynn Bracken, played by Kim Basinger (who won the Oscar).After a horrible shooting at a late night coffee shop in which six people (one of them a former cop) are brutally shot, the rather corrupt L.A.P.D begins an investigation, which leads all three of our main detectives on a winding, dangerous road of murder, Hollywood glamor, and mayhem.The story is crafted brilliantly, with new layers being added to the story as it unfolds. We see how minor characters are connected in ways that are vital to the plot, and how in the end everything fits like a jigsaw puzzle.The screenplay, written by Brian Helgeland and director Curtis Hanson, is top notch, with well rounded characters and cracking dialog. The set direction and costumes are perfect for the 1950's, and the cinematography is beautiful. Overall this is a film which I highly recommend to anyone who likes detectives, period pieces, or just a good story.This is not B.S. I'm telling you. Just the facts.",L.A. Confidential
460,TheIcabisBat,The Best Film Of the 90's,10,9 December 2001,"After careful consideration and watching other possible candidates of mine I believe that this film is the best film of the 90's.  It beats out both ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Fargo"" in my book, which are also very good.  This film has amazing acting, with what I believe is Russel Crowe's best performance. The look and feel of the film just seemed so authentic too, I couldn't help but forget that this movie was made in the 90's.  It looks like your watching a VERY good picture quality 50's film.  I think this should of definatly beaten out the weak ""Titanic"" in the Academy Awards, but that's just another blunder by the academy.",L.A. Confidential

And not to mention the gripping story line and superb execution of the production team. If you've not watched LA Confidential, you've missed something extraordinary.",L.A. Confidential
463,pretzel man,A modern classic,9,20 August 2002,"Hey, maybe I'm just a Spacey fan, but I love this film. The plot revolves around three police officers (Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce) working on different cases that coincide, set in early 1950's LA. You feel as if you're really experiencing the debauchery, the sleaze and the glamour; walking amongst film sirens, downtrodden actors and corrupt cops. The storyline is set at a good pace and I didn't feel bored at all during the film, as the action is spliced with interesting subplots that will eventually all make sense at the end.The acting by Spacey and Pearce is exceptional (Crowe didn't actually have to act much apart from his scenes with his love interest) with the latter pulling off the perfect ambitious backstabber. This movie is for those who enjoy the crime genre, obviously, although there is quite a large firefight at the end it concentrates more on the characters and their investigations. There is also solid backup from Kim Basinger, James Cromwell, (and my favourite character) Danny Devito as the amoral trash reporter.An extremely well-made movie, definitely in my top ten. The only possible bad thing about LA Confidential that I can see is that some people just despised the film because of Guy Pearce's character's actions at the end of it. I actually found it refreshing, because it remains to his character and we're given no traditional Hollywood morality lessons. Anyway, 9 out of 10 from me.",L.A. Confidential
464,Robbmonster,"didn't like it when I first saw it, but now...",9,24 October 2005,"I did not like this film the first time I saw it.It was during the films theatrical run, so it would have been 1997 or 1998. I saw an early morning screening at Greater Union in Melbourne when I should have been at school. I was not familiar with any of the actors, Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito excluded, but those two were ""movie stars"". I remember being especially impressed with Guy Pearce as Ed Exley, but that was about it. I found the story too dense and slow-moving, qualities I now greatly appreciate. Indeed, the dense and slow-moving Once Upon a Time in the West is my all-time favourite movie. It is not unusual that I now like the film so much. I once heard about a reviewer who voted Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America ""worst film of the year"", only to name it ""best film of the decade"" eight years later.L.A. Confidential is quite possibly the best film of the nineties, superbly written, played, and put together. The script - written by director Curtis Hanson and collaborator Brian Helgeland from the ""unfilmable"" novel by James Ellroy - is simply superb, perfectly playing a three-character structure and intersecting in a way that is pleasing and unpredictable. The very lingo-ridden dialogue is also great, and the wonderful cast do a fine job of delivering it.The contributions of the actors cannot be overstated, with each part played pitch perfect. This is an even greater accomplishment when you consider that each of the three lead characters is basically unlikeable. Jack Vincennes (Spacey) is a cop driven by a love of status and attention, Ed Exley, played by Guy Pearce, is a ruthlessly ambitious political-type cop, willing to do whatever is required to speed his climb up the ladder of the LAPD. Pearce delivers what is, in my opinion, easily the best performance of the film. Russell Crowe's brutal Bud White is given the chance to develop the most throughout the film, and Crowe handles this with trademark moxie. The fact that these three actors - given their characters are basically unlikeable - are able to make an audience come to respect and like them is testament to the wonderful script as much as it is to the actors.But the acting goes much deeper. Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her role as Hooker With a Heart of Gold Lynn Bracken. James Cromwell also scores as police captain Dudley Smith. Also of note for me are the performances of Graham Beckel as Dick Stensland, and those of the three ""Nite Owl Suspects"".Visually and sonically, the film omits (for me, at least) a strange, unplaceable vibe, especially noticeable in the opening scenes. I think this is due to the lack of any real score under these scenes. Composers and directors like usually to use the early portion of a film to set up character, and this same time is also used to set up the musical themes for each character. But in the case of L.A. Confidential, there is just a hollow absence. And it works perfectly.There is not enough that can be said for this wonderful achievement, and there are a thousand reasons to see it. I cannot recommend L.A. Confidential highly enough.",L.A. Confidential
465,Cpartak,Brilliant,10,9 March 2005,"I usually refrain from reviewing films on IMDb unless I feel very passionately about them and believe that I need to voice my opinion. This can apply to both films that I loved or despised. Either way, I see no point in reviewing a mediocre film that I forget about the second I step out of the theatre. With that having been said, L.A. Confidential is nothing short of perfection. As with any great film everything starts with the screenplay which in this case was written by Brian Helgeland and Curtis Henson, the latter of which was also the director. The script was adapted from a novel by James Ellroy that I'm ashamed to say I haven't read. However, I have heard that many believed it to be an impossible task to adapt the novel into a film. That makes the screenplay of Helgeland and Henson all the more impressive. An equally daunting task for a great film is to assemble a top notch cast. Once again, L.A. Confidential hits the mark with one of the most impressive casts in recent film history. Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Kim Basinger (who received an Oscar for her role), Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, and Danny DeVito comprise the absolutely top class cast of the film. Yet in my opinion, all of the aforementioned aspects of the film are not even the best part. The best part has to be the absolutely tremendous set designs, costumes, and general recreation of 1950's Hollywood culture. I feel that this was an amazing time and place in American history, and this film takes the audience there. One of the best scenes in L.A. Confidential involves two of the main characters running into a Hollywood starlet who they believe is a fake. What I love about this scene is how subtly the director reminds us that this isn't just any place in America, this is 1950's Hollywood where huge stars like Lana Turner can be found socializing with a member of the mob at a local hot spot. That is the beauty of this film. You feel like you're watching a 1950's film noir through a 1990's camera lens. If you're taking the time to read my review, you're probably wondering why I haven't discussed the plot of the film. The answer to this question is simple, there is really no need. All you have to know is that it's a brilliant film that you should watch no matter what genre of movies you are into. This is in my opinion one of the top ten movies of the last decade and easily the best picture of 1997. Ironically, it lost the Best Picture Oscar that year to Titanic which I feel was the greatest oversight in recent Oscar history. This is a one of a kind film, the likes of which I'm afraid we won't see for a long time to come, if ever. Lastly, if you have not yet seen L.A. Confidential I hope that my review inspires you to do so. Conversely, if you have already experienced it I hope that you are reminded, if only for a brief moment, of what great film making truly is.",L.A. Confidential

Paparazzi waiting to get that one breakthrough picture. These are just some of the elements that make Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential one of the most exhilarating noir thrillers to reach the screen in recent memory. With a script that pays homage to the films of the '40s and '50s and may remind some viewers of the likes of Chinatown, L.A. Confidential proves that every period piece thriller doesn't have to go the way of travesties like Mulholland falls. It takes L.A. Confidential nearly two and one-half hours to spin its tale, but the time passes remarkably quickly. There's hardly a wasted moment in the entire movie, and director Hanson maintains tight control of every scene.",L.A. Confidential
469,Don-121,This film is flash with no substance,1,13 September 1999,"This movie is total flash with absolutely no substance.  Potato Chips for couch potatos.  The stylization is flat.  It would seem from the other reviewers that if you find a bunch of 1930's outfits and cars that your movie is now ""stylized"".  And what's with Kim Basinger?  The big shoker is that we see a photo of the detective kissing a prostitute on the floor with all her clothes on?  Oh my god!  I can overlook a few plot and motivation flaws (there were many in this move), but what's the big payoff here?  An ending riddled in cliches.

Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right.Some reviews have referred to the excessive violence, the movie being different from the book, and other ""flaws"" that set it apart from an excellent film noir movie.  The point they miss is that LA Confidential is not film noir (the fact that it's not in black & white is a good indication!)  It may have elements of that genre inherent in it but this film was obviously made for a 1990's audience.Excessive violence is a required element in all modern films, and I can safely say that the violence here was the most exciting and well done action I've ever seen (if you don't beleive me watch the ending again; CLASSIC!!!)LA Confidential is a beautiful movie, and director Curtis Hanson was right on the mark with everything he did.  After all he is catering to a 1990's audience not a 1950's one.  Therefore LA Confidential should not be compared with movies that were aimed at a different target audience.",L.A. Confidential

I refer to Proof and now, LA Confidential.Guy Pierce was also going to be an interesting prospect.  Apart from the awful soap opera Neighbors, he has only ever done one major motion picture and that was ""...Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"".  A truly dreadful film that must surely be an embarrassment for both drag queens and Australians (in general) alike.Well, how good were they!?  Truly excellent!  I walked out of the cinema feeling as if I'd just watched the greatest film of all time.  You can appreciate how I feel.  These two Australian boys are the STARS of a classic American cop drama.  I expected them to be supporting players so imagine how stunned I was when I realised that they were the heros!Kevin Spacey was excellent (surprise us!) and James Cromwell again proved that he has been in hiding for far too long.  Incidentally, the other night I saw a very young James Cromwell on an old Barney Miller rerun!LA Confidential is a great film, a classic of the nineties.  Having subsequently read the book I can honestly say that Curtis Hanson's achievement in bringing this sprawling epic to the screen is nothing short of amazing!  They cut out enough material for three more movies but retained the distilled essence of the book.Honestly, I could talk for hours about this film.  I won't, though.  You can go now.

Usually (not in all cases) the ´big´ Hollywood films are technically superior, but suffer from flat characters, an uninteresting story and overall dumbness (to say it in a simplistic and maybe overly harsh way). L.A. Confidential is different AND technically flawless. The screenwriters, among them director Hanson, did a very good job to translate Ellroys masterpiece to the screen.

478,Watchalot,Best film of the 90s,10,9 December 2001,"Every so often, all the elements come together to create a truly memorable viewing experience.  LA Confidential is such a movie.From the taut, clever (and often funny) script to the outstanding casting, from the exceptional production design to the inspired direction, this film has everything going for it and easily bears repeated viewing.The story of three very different policemen and the manner in which their lives intersect is handled with skill and intelligence by all involved and, as the story unfolds, the twists and turns leave the viewer engrossed.  Bud White (Russell Crowe), Jack Vincennes(Kevin Spacey) and Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) represent three different types of men all searching for a form of salvation - the ambitious and prim Exley to be released  from the shadow of his father's murder, the vain and showy Vincennes for validation through a quasi-fame and the abusing and abused White for love. How these men change as events force them to confront their demons is the film's emotional core.All the major players are excellent (Guy Pearce and James Cromwell being the standouts for me) but it is the minor players who really hold the film together. Think of Mrs Lefferts and her sad, little life or the slimy, morally bankrupt DA.  The casting of all the characters is exceptional and a major contributor to the film's success.The script is intelligent and does justice to James Ellroy's book and the cinematography, costuming and design evoke the feel of LA in the 50s.Curtis Hanson has fashioned a film noir for the 90s which was criminally overlooked at the Academy Awards in favour of the risible Titanic.

I still shake my head at the thought.Okay, Titanic is technically brilliant and had cutting edge(at the time)special effects, but for all it's box office return, it's not the film that should have won the Oscars it did.Confidential(as it will be henceforth known)is a real piece of craftsmanship. Curtis Hanson's unflinching,non-sympathetic direction just shows these characters for what they all are, flawed. He uses the L.A. landscape to enhance his story. The pace and rhythm to the movie is just like Kevin Spacey's suits, cool, and the music of the period (which I believe he chose himself) are spot on.Then there's the actors.I've said(on these boards) that this is Russell Crowe's best movie, and I stand by it.A man at odds with what he thinks is morally right and wrong who grows before your eyes into what he should be doing instead of what he's told to do is riveting. Guy Pearce is excellent as the man who's actions have motives in progressing his profession and the man who will ultimately solve what is really going on. Kevin Spacey is coolness itself, but again wrangles with his conscience over his profession and his glamorous image. James Cromwell is brooding, his reputation on the line as the investigation tightens around his illegal activities.A throughly brilliant film, one for which I again cannot believe lost out to a sinking ship of a film.10/10",L.A.

With great performances from an ensemble all-star cast and a clever script, the dramatic tension of this modern film-noir classic is an absolute must-see! Told through a variation on the theme of ""good cop, bad cop"" with an overarching corruption angle, this film cleverly deals with issues of racism, social justice and ethics in a non-discriminatory manner. Character development is well-done and the dramatic tension is superb. If you are a fan of crime-drama and detective stories, you won't be disappointed!",L.A. Confidential

486,ibrahimctit,Ridiculously Overrated,4,23 May 2018,"This movie suffers from an overly convoluted and unfocused plot (going after one group of criminals then the big cliche crime boss the next. Having multiple antagonists is fine, but the problem was it felt like two different stories that were weakly connected), characters that would like us to believe they are much more complex than the are (the white knight cop, Bud, who turns out to be a hypocrite. Some might take this cotradiction as character complexity, but the flaws of this character are never acknowledged in the form of facing consequences for you actions, bc in the end he gets the girl), and failure to address the theme of police corruption that it presents (Again, Bud is a thug of a cop, a dispicable person who is only ever rewarded by the film. Lieutenant Exley supposedly represents a moral reformer in the LAPD, but in the end he doesn't significantly change anything or really openly challenge the corrupt LAPD besides at the beginning when he testifies against a fellow cop for their violation of practice. He is also an unsavory person whose moral hypocrisy is never acknowledged). This isn't even to mention the cringey ass dialogue that is trying to hard to sound 1950s and the fact that the only black people in this film are criminals and rapists, and that things seemed to be easily achieved by all the ""protagonists"" with minimal effort put forth.",L.A.

488,Buddy-43,One of the best films ever made,10,22 July 1999,"There is something very unusual about L.A. Confidential in that, unlike in most features, there is no central character to be played by a well known Hollywood star.  Instead, the plot is driven by three cops in 1950s Los Angeles.  They are Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) and Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey).  The former two actors are both Australian (Guy Pearce was in Neighbours back in 1990) and before this film were virtual unknowns in the movie business.  The fact that two of the leads are played by someone who the audience has never seen before is what makes them so fascinating and interesting to watch on screen.  They are both absolutely breathtaking as the two very different police officers and they seem very at home in the glitzy and glamorous atmosphere of the 50s that the movie creates.  As for Kevin Spacey - he too manages to surprise us with his laid back approach to the role of Jack Vincennes who is frequently called The Big V, a movie star among cops.  The storyline deals with a multiple homicide that takes place one night in a café.  Among the victims is a bent cop who had just been fired for starting a riot in the police station.  From here the story progresses through a number of twists but it is really about the relationship between Ed Exley, the by-the-book career climber and Bud White, the loose cannon psycho who has a thing for helping women.  Even if you don't understand all the numerous details of the plot (some of which can be quite hard to pick up on the first time round), the film is still incredibly watchable and tremendously exciting - partly because of the general feel of all the corruption, scams, gangsters and betrayal that existed in 50s LA. There is something about this movie - you have to see it to understand what I mean",L.A. Confidential
489,fiennes7,Character Driven-great piece,10,25 May 1999,"Hollywood is not known for great cinema like this. They could have ruined it, by casting more marketable names, but they didn't. They could have dumbed it, by explain everything that happened in every single scene, but they didn't. This is a wonderful piece driven by the characters. Hanson and Helgeland achieved a manageable story from a book that could never have been adapted in the wrong hands. The acting is just superb. I am still stewing about all the people upset or surprised that Leonardo DiCaprio did not get nominated, what about the lead male cast members of LA Confidential? Kevin Spacey was sublime, as usual. I mean, can this man give a bad performance? Methinks not! Russell Crowe was really impressive as the troubled Bud White (the only character with redeeming features in Ellroy's book). And, of course, Guy Pierce. He was excellent as the political animal, Ed Exley. I ranted and raved for months when Titanic beat LAC for the best picture Oscar! But an aside to Mr Cameron: ever heard of Character Development? Enough said! Best movie of the past 10 years, easy!",L.A. Confidential

Especially when you watch it again ... and again! You find out details of this very smart told story that were not obvious at the first time and that get clear just after the third time watching it. You don't get enough from this film because Curtis Hanson had the sensibility to chose for a perfect cast that gives the book of James Ellroy what it actually is: a dark and brutal story of Los Angeles in the early fifties that only knows losers in all kinds of varieties. There is no good vs. bad. The good guys are bad, too and if you watch the development of the main characters played by Pierce, Spacey and Crowe along the movie you are very confused of not having one person in this movie you can really identify with. Just close to the end this situation changes but not the way you expect it. ""LA Confidential"" is a real masterpiece!",L.A. Confidential
492,amon_re2,"Very good screenplay, but cinematography was lacking",9,21 December 2000,"I really liked this movie because of two reasons.  First, the acting was top notch.  Kevin Spacey is just such a great actor. Virtually everything he touches is amazing (with that exception of The Negotiator).  Russell Crowe is his usual quiet, but forceful self.  And Guy Pierce!  Who ever heard of this guy?  He was fantastic.  See the movie just to see a good young actor.The script and screenplay in this movie were fantastic.  It was a very engrossing story with a great, complex plot.  You had to pay attention to every scene in order to not miss anything.The only complaint I had with this movie was the cinematography.  The directing was nothing special.  No scenes were any different from any others.  There really weren't any dramamtic shots or interesting camera work.  Other than that everything was Grade-A, but because I hold such a high value for cinematography, I gave this an 8 with a note of good measure!",L.A. Confidential

I have to admit I saw it 3 times before I fully understood it and kept all the names straight!Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe stand out in their respective roles, and Guy Pearce and Danny DeVito are good too.   Kim Basinger - not sure what all the fuss is about - personally, I would have rather seen another actress who looked more like Veronica Lake playing the part, but maybe that's just me.But the actor that really stands out is James Cromwell as the police captain.

How Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, and Kevin Spacey DIDN'T get Academy Awards nominations I'll never know (they probably would have cancelled each other out anyway, but it would have been nice for at least ONE of them to get a nom nod). Kim Basinger was good, but not Academy-Award-material-good.I'd go on and on, but I think the other pro-L.A. Confidential-ites summed it up just right. I agree with all of the positive comments about this movie. As for the negative ones, well, you people have a right to your opinions too, it's your loss if you don't appreciate this movie.How this lost to ""Titanic"" (a good, but certainly not great, movie) is beyond my comprehension. Twenty years from now, watch L.A. Confidential and Titanic back-to-back. Which one stands up better? Then we will have our answer to the better picture - and in my opinion, L.A.

496,mightyjabbaatuni,The Best of the Nineties.,10,7 July 2002,"There was never a greater injustice at an awards ceremony than when James Cameron's bloated, over-egged Iceberg-Opera beat this taut, stylish and gripping thriller to Best Picture and Best Director at the Oscars. Curtis Hanson's film is everything that film can achieve and everything that Titanic is not.The script is tremendously well-written, based on James Ellroy's gargantuan, labyrinthine novel. Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson have done a great job in making this a film first and foremost rather than being a mere adaptation of a great book. The script manages to focus on both characters and plot, meaning that neither is sacrificed for the sake of the other, a rare treat indeed these days.The casting director should take a major pat on the back as well. To have two of the three lead roles filled by unknowns was tremendously brave as well as the right decision, it is important that the characters of Ed Exley and Bud White are carrying no intertextual baggage as far as the audience are concerned. Both Guy Pearce and Russell Crowe are now major stars and that can largely be put down to their masterful performances here, Kevin Spacey is as good as we would expect him to be, while great support comes from James Cromwell, David Strathairn, Danny Devito, Ron Rifkin and Oscar-Winner Kim Basinger.When the performances and the script are so good, sometimes the direction can be overshadowed somewhat, not here though. Curtis Hanson shows a master's touch allowing the film to be funny, touching,  thrilling and downright shocking at the right time. The period feel is immaculate too, and the overall look of the film crucial to its plot and resolution. Not merely was it robbed by Titanic as the best film of 1998, it is also the best film of the whole decade.",L.A. Confidential

This film is so intensely gratifying that it is easy to excuse the one mistake I believe it to have: Bud White should be dead. Or, don't show him getting shot 20 times, and then we'll believe that he's okay.  Aside from that, the film is shot well, the acting is extraordinary, the dialogue is rich and compelling, and its just really enjoyable.  It is a great film is also a great book.",L.A. Confidential

Russell Crowe is one of the detectives and he seems to be in fog the time. Danny Devito is a gossip columnist. I don't understand what is so interesting about this movie. It goes at a snail's pace. Almost nothing happens. The dialogue isn't interesting at all. This has to be one of the most overrated movies of all time,the same vien as Taxi Driver with DeNiro or Eyes wide - supposed to be great, but is incredibly boring.

However, looking past these minor minor unrealistic elements the film is amazing. The plot is cleaver, it twists, turns and keeps you completely focused on the film, undoubtedly the films finest quality. This is however closely followed by some brilliant characterisation. What the film does so well is creates three very different male characters who bounce off each other amazingly, not forgetting Kim Basinger's outstanding performance.I have not actually read the novel it was based on but I guess from the positive reviews it stays true to the novel.

The story and script are so powerful that its hard to move away from the screen. Casting is perfect, and the direction is extra- ordinary. Although its a crime mystery movie which means the movie depends more on the story, but acting is too perfect to be ignored. The movie starts with the introduction to crime in LA which is a larger view, then sticks to the characters and ends with a broader view again. A viewer expects a strong plot and a realistic ending for a mystery movie to be perfect and LAC doesn't disappoint.

Basically, I told my friend that the three storylines (Exley, White and Vincennes) orbit around each other until they finally entwine. And you don't necessarily see that coming.I saw the movie again recently and I enjoyed it all over again. L.A. Confidential has a LOT of things going for it -- the look, feel and dialogue of 1950s LA, dead-on casting (I mean, who else could play sleazy Sid Hutchens but Danny DeVito), and a brilliant adaptation of Ellroy's novel -- no mean feat, considering it had upwards of 80 living, breathing characters.Finally, being a Kevin Spacey fan, this movie is doubly special to me. In that regard, it's like ""The Usual Suspects"", ""The Negotiator"", ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" and probably like ""American Beauty"", a movie I have yet to see.

Officer Bud White, champion & savior of women abused, loyal to his fellow officers (he risked his career by not turning in his partner who was really a corrupt cop without his knowledge) who had one glaring weakness, A uncontrollable violent temper on women beaters. According to his corrupt partner Dick Stensland, ""He got his priorities all screwed up"" because of it.  And he (Stensland) was a alcoholic on top of that.  White, in the end though, got the gorgeous Lynn Brackens to appreciate his ""screwed up priorities"".  Congrats to you Bud and your ""screwed up priorities"".Sgt. Ed Exley, son of a legendary lieutenant who was shot while on duty. He is the complete opposite on Officer White as far as loyalty goes.  He goes by the book, extremely intelligent, a political ambitious animal who would sell out his own father to get ahead.  Then again maybe not since his father's death is why he joined the force in the first place.  So involved with his crusade that even in his own admittance, ""He lost his sight of what justice really was"".  He started as watch commander with a burning ambition to becoming a homicide detective like his father, that was continuously denied by the Captain Dudley Smith until he rats out on his fellow officers. He was the perfect person in the end to explain it all what happened (the murder case).  His strength, although he looked like a nerd (""Ed, lose the glasses"") he had a backbone of steel when he needed to have it and he wasn't going to let anybody use him without getting something in return.  The writer was absolutely brilliant in how he got the two complete opposites (White and Exley) joined together in alliance to fight off the corrupt, murdering cops, cleverly masterminded by Captain Smith.Sgt. Jack Vincennes, celebrity cop, suave, smooth ""Hollywood Jack"", consultant of a television show (A Dragnet copycat), who took payoffs from a Enquirer-type writer Sid Hutchins in exchange for top stories.  He had a different angle:  He worked for Narcotics wanting to find the missing Mickey Cohen heroin which was the primary motive for the killings by Capt. Smith and his corrupt employees. He is the first to realize that Capt Smith is the killer and Smith had to kill him to tie up his loose ends.  How he reached me was that until he develop a conscience, he was so deep in his involvement with his ""outside hobbies"" that he doesn't even remember why he became a good guy.  At least White and Exley did.L.A. Confidential is one of my favorite all time flick that is worth watching again.  All of this summary is written on the ""Q/T"" and very ""HUSH HUSH!""

This movie is a story about the Los Angeles police corruption. There are three main actors,Bud white, Exley and Jack vincennes, they are all policemen,and don't like each other but involved together because of a homicide. These three actors have their own charactors, white is impulsive,but kind and soft, he hates the bully men because of his miserable childhood. Exley is smart and ambitious,he is trying to find the man who killed his father. The last one is jake, a smart man but selfish.
The most classical scene is when jack vincennes said rollo tomasi to liam,and then liam said it to exley, wow, every time i saw here,i was so surprised by the design. At last jake was shoted and dead,but he give exley a sign to find out the truly killer.
Expect for three main actors,there is a actress,she has just played a small part but bright, because of this movie i know that she was Kim Besinger. In the movie,white and exley all love her ,and in my opinion, i think she loves them two, but finally she choose white because of she likes the peaceful life. When the case is over, she said to exley,Some men get the world. Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.she is so gentle,I'm completely understand why two men fall in love with her completely, and i also love her. And she got an oscar for her best performed in this movie.

It just drags and drags on and has boring twists that make no sense and again, are no fun to try to decipher. I would pass on this movie folks. There are millions of better pictures out there.

Each body in this film is not just a person, they're a character. They each have something to gain, whether noble or not, and that is what makes this film interesting. The shootouts are fun, but the plot and characters are what drives this movie. My one criticism is the length. There were parts where the movie just seemed to drag a bit. In my opinion, the ""Bloody Christmas"" bit could have been cut altogether, or, if they needed a way for Guy Pearce's character to get his Detective badge, it could have started with him as detective and then been mentioned in passing. It wasn't really necessary to the rest of the plot. Other than that, however, this movie is excellent. Read my original review of this movie at http://themoviemistress.blogspot.com/",L.A.

This is actually a pretty famous movie, but somehow people don't really take notice of it. It's one of those movies you watched with your father years ago on VHS. You remember it being a good movie, but forgot how great it actually is until you watch it again years later. I really recommend this movie! Especially if you like movies about Organized Crime, Police Corruption & the Good Cop Bad Cop routine.LA Confidential is about three detectives of the corrupt LAPD (Big Surprise). Set in the 50s, they all use their own unique methods to uncover a conspiracy of a massacre that took place in an all night diner. What follows is a story with several twists and turns to expose who is behind this mysterious crime.The Cast also has a cool as hell, with Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe & Kevin Spacey playing the main detectives. Probably the coolest role Russell Crowe has ever played – A tough LA Cop who doesn't f**k around and beats the s**t out of anyone not playing by his rules.Kevin Spacey is awesome as always and even Guy Pearce (Momento, Ravenous) showed his acting skills & talents. He plays the good honest cop that wants justice and will always follow the correct procedures to get this. He and Russell then make the perfect Good Cop-Bad Cop team! The only lame part of this movie is Kim Basinger. I don't like her! She can't act and has an irritating face.But apart from this, it's a Classic Film. May be a tad long for some people (over 2 hours), but if you haven't seen this, it's a great film to watch of you are in the mood for a Crime Classic.I give it a 8.5 of out 10 just because the film's elements mix together so well.",L.A.

517,PretentiousMovieShit,"Strong 8 - Really great! Not quite as legendary as I hoped, but still strong.",8,17 December 2018,"Guy Pearce is so, so good. Even next to Crowe and some other more icky costars, Pearce really shines. Overall, you really have to keep on top of all the dialogue and characters to keep up, plus the script gets a bit expositional at points. I know that sounds contradictory but you'll know it when you see it.That being said, best police mystery/drama since Chinatown. Really strong storytelling on the most part and a fun exploration of interweaving narratives.",L.A. Confidential

I have seen this film about 7 times completely and repeatedly and even than I can see it again and again with all of my close friends no matter how many times.Such films are made very rarely and by extreme luck and can never get old as several greatly positive roles are shown in it to stop evil men from torturing common good weak people specially ladies who cannot defend themselves as men can",L.A.

522,kerwin-3,Contrived ending keeps L.A. Confidential from greatness,7,9 November 1998,"L.A. Confidential is a thoroughly entertaining movie with great performances from all - especially the two ""unknown"" leads. However, it was certainly not the best movie of 1997 (that was The Sweet Hereafter), and it was not as good as some people claimed. It is definitely not another Chinatown. Compare the endings of these two films and you will see the big difference. If L.A. Confidential had not ended in such a contrived, Hollywood fashion, it may have been one of the great films of recent years.",L.A. Confidential
523,I DUMB,LA Confidential puts Titanic to shame.,10,11 November 1998,"Without a doubt,the best movie of 1997.  Why this did not receive more Oscar consideration is beyond me.  Russell Crowe definitely should have been nominated for Best Actor.  He portrays the sense of having bottled rage that can explode at any minute better than any other actor I have seen on the screen.  Kevin Spacey gave another monumental performance yet received no Oscar nomination.  I guess having back to back to back great performances will do that to you.  You cannot find a better trio to play these three cops.  White(Crowe) is the veteran cop who loves to use violence to get the job done.  Exley(Pearce) is the straight as an arrow rookie who prefers to use his smarts and mind games in place of violence.  He is kniving and has no reservations to stab you in the back to ahead.  These two characters are perfect because they are complete opposites of each other. Vincennes(Spacey) is a medium of the two.  He used to be like White but is what Exley is striving to become.  His transformation throughout the film to amend his wrong actions give his character in this film the most credibility.  The one thing I did not agree with was Kim Basinger's win of Best Supporting Actress.  She seemed quite dull and did not give half the performance as Crowe or Spacey.  Also, if you watch this movie, watch out for the funniest moment on screen this year dealing with Exley insulting the ""Lana Turner hooker.""",L.A. Confidential
524,Joey-29,My favourite movie of last year,10,23 November 1998,"I've seen this movie for the third time this week. It's getting better all the way. Great acting by the leading men (Spacey, Pearce and Crowe) Inexplicable is the ignoration of their performances by the Academy. Kim Basinger didn't have my vote for an Oscar, but the 3 men would have it. One of last year's best movies. It's a shame it didn't won an Oscar for best picture. Isn't a good picture a picture you can see a several times and just pick something new out of it each time again? LA Confidential is like that.",L.A. Confidential
525,iain-6,As good as the previews,9,6 January 1999,"I wish I had seen this on the big screen. I made the mistake of listening to a couple of reviews, which made it out to be an overblown melodramatic adaptation of a contrived James Ellroy novel. Having read some Ellroy, I could imagine how bad that was.The strange thing is, that isn't far from the truth, but the movie is  far better than it implies. This is an excellent film-noir / thriller, superbly acted, and credible in the way only an Ellroy novel can make outrageous situations credible. Not one, but three excellent leading actors as cops (Crowe, Spacey, Pearce) working against / with each other in unexpected ways, each true to a very different vision of police work. Pearce (Ed Exley) especially does a superb job; he initially comes across as a weasel, and yet earns respect without changing his nature. And Kim Basinger is wonderful. I don't think she has ever been better.The melodramatic touches oddly add to the credibility, and whether or not this reflects '50's LA, it certainly reflects a believable version of the gloss, allure and seediness we expect of LA.",L.A. Confidential
526,kyra16,Tour de Force,10,9 February 1999,"This is the ultimate movie on the corruptness of the police force during the 1950's.  No one is going to make a better movie than LA Confidential, the cast is perfect, the direction is superb, the screenplay is amazing, the choice of music, the graphic brutality, the not so fine line between good and evil.When I saw this in the theatres, I came out of the theatre and couldn't say anything because I was awed. And I was amazed by how wonderful Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce were, I had never heard of them before, so I didn't know what to expect, but now I have two new favorite actors.  And I couldn't believe that Russell was a New Zealander and Guy was an Aussie.  They had great American accents.  And of course Kevin Spacey was superb as always.Any way, this is an awesome movie, go rent it if you have not seen it.",L.A. Confidential
527,Banky-7,"Titanic was good, but not this good",8,25 April 1999,"Okay, I all ready wrote a 21/2 page review for this, but it had profanity and gave away basically the whole entire plot.  I don't think they'll post it, so I'm writing this one.  I'll refrain from cursing and revealing too much. L.A. Confidential was the best movie made last year, no matter what the good folks at the Academy say.  As is the case this year(Saving Private Ryan the best movie made this year), the Academy gives the award to the wrong movie.  Oh well.  There's nothing you can really do. Am I ranking on Titanic?  No.  Titanic was an unbelievable movie.  It was spectacular.  But you have to remember that it's not necessarily cinema. More than half of the time, those actors and actresses were imagining that the ship was sinking and looking down at a blue screen.  Are there any blue screens in this one?  None that I can think of.  It's filmaking at its best. It's a classic.  Film noir reborn really. You've got all the classic elements of film noir.  The doomed heros who struggle with inner and outer demons, the femme fatale who knows more than you'd think, a corrupt system, interesting camera angles(like the one used when Bud goes to Patch Pierce's home.  The camera focused on Pierce, looking upward while in the backround is Bud, out of focus.  All of that good stuff.  I think that Kevin Spacey is great in the film, as is Guy Pearce and I have now forgiven the actor who played Bud White (can't remember his name) for the horrible sci-fi thriller Virtuosity.  Basinger, who won her first career Oscar, is...good?  I'm not sure on this one.  She does a good job.  Especially in her scene with Guy Pearce.  If you've seen it, you know what scene I'm talking about.  I just didn't get her motivation on things though.  She was the hooker with the heart of gold.  How stereotypical is that?  But that's what film noir gave us in the end. Stereotypes.  The hooker with the heart of gold was made a stereotype because it was made popular by film noir.  Did she deserve the Oscar? This is a great movie.  Watch it.  The ending might surprise you and also upset you, but it's a great movie.  It will probably be like Chinatown and last the test of time.  It was the best movie made last year, all though I liked Chasing Amy and Good Will Hunting the most.",L.A. Confidential

The feel, the look, the action, it's all there.",L.A. Confidential

I had seen the movie once before but I literally forced my girlfriend to sit and watch it with me. No word of a lie, she was genuinely glued to the movie within twenty minutes. In this film noire, set in the Los Angeles circa 1950, we introduced to three budding police officers--Kevin Spacey portrays Jack Vincennes, the ""model"" cop who regularly appears television.  Guy Pearce plays a the young Ed Exley.  But Russell Crowe steals the show as a Officer Bud White, a man driven to protect a woman from any possible harm.  It has been quite a long time since a film has captured my attention such as this.  Be on the look out for James Cromwell who portrays Captain Dudley Smith.  Get a date or call a friend and pop in this movie and I will guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",L.A. Confidential
530,gehrzie,Another vote for this as best of the '90s,10,23 September 2000,"So much has been said already about this movie that I fear I'll only echo previous sentiments, but I'll try to put in some more or less original comments.But I have to start with a not so original vote for this as the best movie of the 1990s. That this movie lost to Titanic has forever reduced the Oscars to the level of the Grammys in my mind. I'm torn between this and Fargo as the best movie of the decade, but I tend to come down on the side of L.A. Confidential because its brilliance seems just so unlikely. That the Coen brothers could make a quirky comedy-drama out of a crime gone wrong isn't surprising. But L.A. Confidential?: the unknown -- and mostly Down Under -- starring cast, Kim Basinger giving the performance of a career, casting James Cromwell of all people as the villain, a journeyman director pulling it all together, and, above all, the best-plotted mystery in decades being adapted from a ludicrously overplotted novel.I get a kick out of reviews that bemoan this film's ""bleak"" worldview. Obviously, bleak is a relative word, and relative to Ellroy's novel, the movie is as bleak as freakin' Fantasia. Of course, when you center your novel's plot around a Walt Disney-like character who sires a psychopath and makes pornography, you should expect changes in the transition to film (although it would have been fun if the family amusement park from the novel had been retained in place of the Santa Monica Freeway -- ""Mike Eisner's attorney on line three, Mr. Hanson!""). Anyway, this movie is a model of writing adaptations, in that it retains the cynicism of the novel while not belaboring it (e.g., making Dudley by turns charming and ruthless, but never sadistic) and keeps us guessing without throwing in every plot device known to Robert Towne (or by sacrificing storytelling at the expense of cleverness -- cf. The Usual Suspects, The Big Sleep).Finally, many comments on this site have (rightly) praised the film's look: the cinematography, set decoration, costuming, lighting, etc. Let me also make a plug for the soundtrack. Perhaps expectations for the dramatic soundtrack have been in the Diane Warren Age, but Curtis Hanson obviously knows that music can reinforce the story, not just move product (see also the soundtrack for his latest movie, with its Bob Dylan single).",L.A. Confidential
531,armbow,20 years from now,10,21 January 2001,I believe that we should have a hall of fame for movies over 20 years old. I think that this is the right period of time to tell whether a film will be a classic.  In my view this will be up there with the best. It has style and great acting and the production is first class.  Of recent films this ranks with Shawshank as the one that slipped passed the Academy - hence the need for the 20 year award.  I think Titanic will be silently resting in peace and forgotten by then,L.A. Confidential

Last night I was flipping channels and found it on regular cable. I'm sure it was edited for language and maybe nudity, but found it to be quite good. I will probably rent it the next time I'm at the video store. This was a smart movie with good acting and great dialogue. See it for the first time or see it again. It is worth it...",L.A.

534,dwgerard-45802,Read the book instead,7,6 July 2021,"It started out well enough. The idea of Danny DeVito as Sid Hudgens providing exposition by way of narration was a good one. But it seems they gave up on that idea too soon. It was also true to the book for a while (Bloody Christmas), but this could not continue. There is no way that the novel could be compressed into even a long movie. Problem is, they kept in the wrong parts, and left out the true motivitions of Exley (the expecations of his father, an act of cowardice in war) and Vincennes (the drunken killing of innocents). They also left out the original crime that ties the whole sotry together in the end.Kevin Spacey was horribly miscast. A great actor, but not nearly the character in the book, and decidely not a noir figure.And where the hell was LA? If not for a few oil derricks and shots of city hall, we could have been anywhere. A greivous error in direction and cinematography.It seems they started with a hollywood ending (I know! Let's have a heroic shootout that wraps up the whole story!) and worked backwards from there. Very unfortunate.Elroy's novels are about corruption, power, and how power is wielded. They also describe the dark underbelly of the places they occur, and use anti-heroes as the protagonists. These are the components of great noir.In the end, while the movie fails as a noir, it does ultimately succeed as a better than average detective mystery. But oh, what it could have been, with a better adaptation and more visionary direction.",L.A. Confidential
535,benchair,Truly sensational,10,2 October 2007,"I saw this film at the cinemas when it came out. I thought I would just see another random serial killer movie. But when it started and I saw the three protagonists introductions, I didn't like them, they were three corrupt lowlifes. One just in it for the headlines, one a brutal and racist cop and a man just in it to be out-do his father.Although as the film progresses I began to like them more and more. The fantastic performances by Kevin Spacey in particular and the other two Aussie leads (Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce), as well as the terrific depiction of LA in the 1950's. It was adapted from James Ellroy's epic novel, although there were many major differences between the novel and the film, the film still provided enough twists and turns in order to keep the audience guessing. Yes it was truly and entertaining cinematic experience.Basically the plot is about a mass murder at a coffee shop called the Nite Owl. It is investigated by three detectives (Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce). And the case serves as a redemption to the three corrupt cops.I was shocked to see that Titanic beat LA Confidential in almost every category at the Oscars*.10/10. Enjoy it is a great film.",L.A.

537,QulkSiLvR,"A stunning, captivating look at the corruption of the 1950s LAPD that proves that film noir masterpieces can still be made.",10,2 January 2002,"The Maltese Falcon.  The Third Man.  Double Indemnity.  The Killers.  All are brilliant pieces of film noir, cinematic masterpieces that envelope the viewer and make him/her wish that they too could be involved in the lives of the elegant cops, robbers, and everything in between that they watch...even if it means getting shot at, accused of anything and everything and, of course, beat up by crooked police officers.  All are also from the 1940s. Enter L.A. Confidential, Curtis Hanson's brilliant detailing of the corruption of the Los Angeles Police Department in the 1950s. From the opening credit sequence's Americana shots to the pinstripe suits, retrospective soundtrack, and oh-so Michael Corleone fedoras, the set and costumes are exquisite, mixing the glorious with the gloriously ugly and masterfully juxtaposing the glamour of the setting with its dirty, seamy underbelly. Russel Crowe (homicide), Guy Pearce (homicide), and Kevin Spacey (vice)are equally spectacular as the triumvirate of honest cops who go up against the baseness and big muscle of Los Angeles' rackets. James Cromwell plays police chief Dudley Smith to perfection, and Danny Devito turns in a solid performance as Sig Hudgens, the Hush-Hush magazine writer who is mixed up in something...we just don't know what. Kim Basinger is both gorgeous and utterly convincing in her rendition of the Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute who captures the hearts of a few too many people. The plot is meandering, skillfully woven, and appropriately deceitful.  It is mesmerizingly suspenseful and worthy of the highest praise.  Much credit to James Ellroy, whose novel inspired this first-tier work.L.A. Confidential is one of the strongest, if not THE strongest, films noir to have come out of the new school.  Beyond that, it shows what modern cinema as a whole can be--an involving, enveloping walk, jog, or sprint through a situation that moves the viewer to want anything but to go back to his or her actual life.",L.A.

538,The_Murdoc,An Example of it's kind,9,1 August 2010,"It's hell of a kind of those 90's shoot first talk later movies. I first watched it as a kid. Since I watched it again, I thought to add some words about it here. Some good things that I recall right now about this movie......Excellent character interactions....very good character build-ups especially of Guy Pearce........The bloody Christmas scene was greatly done by camera(I think it was a challenge for the camera to find the perfect spots in that narrow passage). Russell Crowe was just perfect character. Each crime scene had very good camera introduction. ""Rollo Tomasi"" was probably an original concept, because I never saw this particular verbal identification of such type of criminals in any other movies. I think any more words will turn this into a spoiler. So, Watch The Movie If you like action and mystery in crime scenario. More interaction from Kevin Spacey in the story, would have make it better though. :D",L.A. Confidential

This should have taken home Best Movie, and Best Supporting actor. Outstanding cast, great story, and a plot twist I will rank up there in the top 3 best twists ever. Everyone does a good job in this movie, even Babe's faithful owner James Cromwell (that'll do pig, that'll do)...Telling the story of how gangsters are being killed while drugs and organized crime run the streets of 50's LA, a new nerdy cop with a wee bit of an ego tries to make a name for himself. This happens while a ""Never hit a woman"" Attitude cop played perfectly by Russell Crowe tries to find out how a woman died, Danny Devito runs an underground magazine called Hush,Hush, Kevin Spacey lights up the screen as a poster-boy cop, and several other characters do lotsa other awesome things....eventually these separate stories converge and by the time the movie is over you are left thinking ""why didn't i see this sooner!!??""....Better than the suuuuper over-hyped Training Day, or any other recent cop movie other than The Departed (LA Confidential is better btw), you'd be missing out if you don't watch this at least once.",L.A.

After my fiancée put it on believing it to be a classic, I blanked out after 15 minutes and chose to write an essay instead (that says something)! I can't fault the acting, but my God the story line was dull. The plot felt really clunky and jumped all over the place. For example, a 20 second scene of a politician being blackmailed to change his vote, with no explanation or mention of it again. Then the twist at the end is that a cop is corrupt, even though he admits to being dirty in Scene #1 - literally..

Im not sure if other people would agree with me but I think there is a lot of similarities between this and American Gangster which I thought was a masterpiece. Upon first watching this film the first three or five minutes you think it might be a little doughy and over narrated by Danny Devito but it is'nt. I was speechless after watching. Everything is perfect. I hated Guy Pearce (Ed) in the start but by the end you fall in love with him by the end. Crowe is everything you want him to be. And Spacey is like the icing on the cake. Every actor is perfect and I really think nothing needs changing. If your a fan of this genre of movie this is sure to be your favorite as well as mine. Watch It Now!,L.A. Confidential

For Hollywood to have produced such a rich film with some of the most complicated and deep characters I have ever seen was such a shock. The fact that two of the leads are unknown Aussies makes it even sweeter. Films like this should show executives what they can do with their $30 million stars and their overblown special effects.

When I saw it for the third or fourth time I realized my confidence in american (and especially Hollywood) movies had grown. A lot. Maybe it was the brilliant story weaved around colourful though stereotyphical characters, maybe it was the amazing complexity plot with subtle and surprising turns, the many ways to interpret the dialogue or simply the sharp edge it had towards Hollywood ideals, sort of hidden, set back in the fifties but aiming at the present as well.

It is almost inspirational - to live up to the standard set by a parent (or brother depending on whether you have read the book or not) and to try to exceed it. The acting is brilliant, the script is both at times entertaining and serious.   I watch films to escape and this film painted a picture of a world which has a veneer of repectability and innocence but is ruled by hatred, violence and bigotry.

551,cheesboy,Fabulous casting,9,6 May 1999,"As an Australian there was nothing more pleasing than watching L.A. Confidential and seeing two fine Australian actors doing their best. Russel Crowe has been around for ages and has played a neo-nazi skinhead in Romper Stomper (the movie that was the inspiration for the recent American History X), a jackeroo(something similar to a cowboy), a gay builder, also the pyscho computer creation in Virtuosity. It shows he has a huge range and is capable of the tough guy and also the soft guy both of these talents which were utilized superbly in this movie, in fact not being biased in any way I thought he gave easily the best performance of the movie and was unlucky not to see more recognition for this.There was also Guy Pearce who greatly shocked me in this movie, his acting credits include the soapie Neighbours and then a dud movie Dating the Enemy, as well as his role in The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert. Up until L.A. I had been less than impressed by his acting but in this movie he just blew me away. In particular the interrogation scene which was one of the highlights of the movie.The reason why I enjoyed this movie is that they chose actors who suited their roles from the book, and did not change them to make a star vehicle (for example the gross corruption of the book Just Cause when turned into a movie which was destroyed by grave casting errors as well as some terrible direction), it gave this film an integrity that is so lacking from most Hollywood movies",L.A.

Then, I caught it on cable later and watched it for lack of anything else to do. It was pretty good! Sound kinda dumb? Well, YOU try it on and maybe you'll see what I mean. Even the second time, I felt the plot was so far out the film was salvaged only because of the fine cinematography and acting.....",L.A. Confidential

With an impeccable cast, a brilliant screenplay, and wonderful cinematography this film is a must for everyone.",L.A. Confidential
556,wjflanigan,"By far the best film of the nineties, and perhaps ever.",10,26 January 2001,"Unfortunately, many people have never seen this superlative film.  ...LA confidential excels where other films try to.  It carefully combines drama, action, and romance into one convoluted and twisted package.
This is one of the few films that demands a re-viewing.  The acting is top notch, Spacey, Crowe, Pierce, and Bassinger are all excellent.  Kevin spacey's portrayal of Jack Vincennes, a Hollywood cop, is performed expertly, as is Pierce's role as Ed Exley.  Each of the three main characters grow and change, and in the end, we don't know who to feel sorry for.  Few movies can pull this off with this many central characters.  LA Confidential pulls it off without losing speed.  However it would be easy to say that Bassinger and Crowe steal the show.  Crowe's skilled juxtaposition of strength, anger, and frailty is definitely his defining role.
The plot is thick, twisting, and engrossing, although at times it gets just a little too tangled.  The screenplay, as expected, is also top notch, and a good many of the lines are taken directly from James Ellroy's novel, a must read, by the way.For those that crave action, there's plenty of it, including a riveting final gunfight.  Musically and visually, the film puts you in Hollywood LA in the 1950s, the total immersion in a glamorous but corrupt city is spectacular.Unlike many adaptations of books, LA Confidential stands on its own as one of the most compelling and well made movies of the past decade.  A must see for anyone; definitely one of the clearest and most poignant examples of why movies have managed to capture the minds of viewers for the last century.",L.A. Confidential
557,pschwart9,L.A. Confidential gives us all the goods...in a tasteful and original way.,10,26 June 2001,"L.A. Confidential is a diamond in the rough. Slicing through the haze of contemporary Hollywood, Curtis Hanson presents a moral tale within the guise of a ""trashy,"" noirish crime mystery. This film sparkles because it satisfies the movie-lover (action sequences that are both exciting and original; heart-felt romance; the portrayal of strong but not infallible heroes) while it also plays out as a powerful morality tale. L.A. Confidential casts light on the sins of Hollywood and of all Americans: greed, lust, ambition, selfishness. The semantic elements of the film, notably the noirish atmosphere and obligatory gun-fights, reinforce the nostalgic feel of the film. We are taken back to the Classical Era of Hollywood, before the evolution of the big blockbuster. Like Grease, L.A. Confidential satisfies our yearning for a simpler time.
Yet the film's narrative is by no means simple, even though it feels so accessible to the true film-lover. For this reason, L.A. Confidential avoids cliches and refuses to draw the line between good and evil for the viewer. Rather, the viewer must observe events, weigh evidence, and play detective along with a perfectly-cast triumvirate of Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pierce. L.A. Confidential draws the audience in and never lets go until the climactic finale. Crowe and Spacey are as deserving of Oscars for this film as for Gladiator and American Beauty, if not more so.Perhaps my own nostalgia shapes my opinions today. In a way, it is nostalgia for a year, 1997, that could produce a movie like L.A. Confidential that, faced with the likes of Shawshank Redemption and Titanic, would not even win Best Picture. How much could possibly have changed in five years? Just look at the weak film crops of 2000 and 2001 and one realizes that L.A. Confidential would make any movie today pale in comparison. However, it is not enough to say that L.A. Confidential is the best of what's available. Somehow, someway, Curtis Hanson and his cast put together all the tangibles and intangibles to create a movie that ""has everything"" - action, romance, mystery, suspense, superb writing, breathtaking acting....and the list goes on. Hanson has done more than infuse new life into the crime genre; he has created a cinematic masterpiece with life lessons waiting to discovered beneath its surface.",L.A. Confidential

That said, I did actually like this film, and actually understood it at the end. I thought that this was a pretty unique idea, and god, I would have so loved to live in the 50's after watching this film!The actors were all very good, but somehow I have a certain attachment to the name ""Rollo Tomasi""! However, I still have no idea why Kim Basinger won the Oscar ... her role wasn't very significant and she didn't play it that well.I think that Guy Pearce or Kevin Spacey should have been nominated instead - Guy Pearce played the goody goody snitch who was always bullied by the other cops [altogether now - aaaaaaaaw] and Kevin Spacey played the ""celebrity"" cop, who I thought was just so damn cool that he should have been in the movie a lot more. And he was the only cop who was nice to Guy Pearce!The only thing that really did spoil the movie was the fact that there were too many different plots all interwoven and only tied up at the end - such as the prostitution, the Nite Owl killings, the drugs etc. But it was a whole lot better than Titanic.",L.A.

I've shown this film to a lot of my friends who are not serious movie viewers (prefering a Sandra Bullock or Meg Ryan film above all others) and they loved it there is really something special about this film I would recommend it to anyone (even those of you who are foolish enough to not like Russell Crowe) Kim Basinger is fabulous as well as Kevin Spacey. There is something about this film that really gets to me I think the style is creative and visually appealing as well it has an old Hollywood look and feel that is really authentic. The script is also fantastically crafted its funny, mysterious and intelligent. The ending is not what you'd expect...I think anyone who watches it will be pleasantly surprised.",L.A. Confidential

It's got everything, crooked cops, drugs, prostitutes, blackmail, and anything else you could imagine. The plot is a little hard to follow, but it all seems to come together in the end.This movie has a very twisted plot that needs constant attention and critical thinking.

Also, everyone thinks that exley is a coward but then he wins over their respect and gets them to work for him. There is so much deception in the film. WE see the whole LAPD crumbling before our eyes and it is pretty exciting. It starts out with Exley ratting out his fellow officers, then we find out bud's partner was corrupt.

570,BVavs,A Classic Example of Film Noir....Modernized for General Consumption!,9,21 May 2007,"There was a time during the late 1930's to mid 1950's where a genre of hard-nosed detectives matched wits with cleverly colorful criminals. Where the dialogue was a slick representation of what it meant to be an actor. Where the shadows and darkness was as pivotal to the movie as the lighting. The genre was Film-Noir, and for almost 2 decades, it lived and breathed prominately with other cinematic styles, aiming to thoroughly entertain audiences. During this era, there became far too many films to mention, that were both ultimately, and eternally recognized as classics. Almost 50 years later another film was added to this prestigious list. LA Confidential, Curtis Hanson's homage to a respected genre, whose popularity somehow faded into the darkness it was widely regarded for; eventually disappearing and becoming completely forgotten.Where to begin with the complimentary praises this film deserves? The film grabs ahold of you from this first second of its beginning, to the rolling credits. The lively hood of each character is successfully achieved. This accomplishment can be attributed to equal parts of excellent screen writing, casting perfection, and the raw talents of the actors involved. I will not get into specifics, due to the fact that I refuse at this point in time to convey anything that could be deemed as a spoiler. Let's just say that everyone, especially Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and James Cromwell, play their respective characters with an underlined tenacity, blended with seemingly effortless coolness. In other-words, each and every single actor has brought along their A-Game to accompany the script, which is also as top notch as the performances that bring it to life.One other fact that I will loosely point out is the plot line itself. In short, the story ranks with the best from the Film-Noir genre. As the movie carries on, it continues to develop into a plot, thick with twists and turns. Around every corner is a surprise that more or less, is impossible to predict, and can only be anticipated with the type of eagerness that often makes it difficult to breathe. Whether it's the unexpected development of the characters themselves, or the multiple surprises contained within the script, this movie will leave even the cleverest of sleuths guessing and gasping with every cinematic unveiling....All the way to the very end. Yet even though this film is thick with surprises and unexpected character developments, it never feels weighed down, nor at any point does it ever drag. It's because of this fact, combined with the talented performances each actor gives, that I confidently can rank this film as one of the ""Must See Movies"" of the 1990's! Or one of the best ""Film-Noir"" pictures ever made. My hat is officially off to anyone involved!",L.A. Confidential

This movie had several nominations at the 1997 Academy Awards but the audience loved the Titanic which reduced the chances from winning a real award. I liked two characters in this movie which points out the ""good cop, bad cop"" theme. Russell Crowe who plays Detective Bud White, is a rough L.A. Detective doing whatever's necessary to bring justice in the streets of L.A., even if it means bending the rules a little bit. He is definitely ruthless and unsympathetic except for the women who were beaten up by their husbands. You can really feel the merciless character that Crowe plays in this movie. Another actor that gave out his best performance was Guy Pearce who plays the role of the character, Ed Exley, a detective who tries continue the legend that his father created and left for him. Not only he wants to continue his father legend but he want to be way better than him as in following the rules of the law and not being as ""hardcore"" as Detective Bud White. He is the one who plays the good cop who feels it's not necessary to bend the rules to clean up the city from scum.

579,Koop-4,One of the Greatest Crime Films of all Time!,10,26 April 2002,"THE PLOT: LA Confidential is based in the seedy Los Angeles of the 1950s. It is the story of three cops; Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a celebrity cop, always out to make a buck catching famous people using drugs with the help of a sleazy gossip magazine writer (Danny DeVito) and is the consultant on a police drama TV show. Officer `Bud' White (Russel Crowe) is a rough and powerful brute, a hater of woman beaters who is not afraid to deliver his own brand of justice. And Detective Lieutenant Edmund J Exley (Guy Pierce) is the force's golden boy, who'll do anything to get ahead, as long as it's by the books. These three very different men are drawn into the investigation of a mass murder in the Night Owl, an all night diner. But not everything is as it seems as further revelations involving the Chief of Detectives (James Cromwell), a rich millionaire (David Stratharn) and a Veronica Lake look-alike call girl (Kim Baisinger) ensure the case is not easily filed away.LA Confidential, as it was lauded on its' release in 1997, is the best piece of film noir since Chinatown, made 23 years earlier. Some even proclaim it Chinatown's superior. Both deal with corruption in a period `city of angels' LA and feature up and comers who would become huge stars. But most important of all, both contain rich and powerful twisted scripts. They are dark, twisting movies, diabolical in their construction. LA Confidential, like Chinatown before it, fits the film noir mantle like a glove, despite the apparent differences. The lighting, as well as not being in black and white (the usual standard for film noir) uses vibrant colour and most scenes take place in daylight, instead of the sinister and dark backstreets most common in the genre.This is the kind of movie I love. Tapping into a seemingly dead form of filmmaking, but using modern restrictions (or lack of) to accommodate the style, LA Confidential has become a classic of crime and film noir. Full of twisting plotlines and revelations in the characters, it will always keep you guessing and make you want to watch it again to see if you can finally make perfect sense of the story. Pure Genius.The script featured in LA Confidential is one of the best in recent years, and one of the best crime adaptations in cinema history. The tale comes from the bestselling epic novel of crime and corruption in 1950s LA. The novel, a twisting and vibrant tale over six hundred pages long, was believed unadaptable by most, including its author, James Ellroy. In fact, most proposals to convert it into film were thought ludicrous. That, and the fact that the film was not the type that huge Hollywood hits were made of. With three major characters instead of just one and a larger emphasis on mystery and intrigue than action, most Hollywood studios thought it an unattractive proposal to begin with. However, writers Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland were game to adapt the novel, keeping the characters and major plot points intact, and around these constructed a masterpiece of modern scriptwriting. The other pieces of the production, music, sets, costumes and photography all fit sleekly into the period timeframe.LA Confidential is a film all about facades. First and foremost is the illusion of the picture perfect Los Angeles. The narration that commences the film perfectly captures the mood, as Danny DeVito exposes the lies of a peaceful and beautiful LA with his nasal vocals and sleazy tone. Hollywood and television are used to sell the image of Los Angeles, and so many young hopeful's dreams are crushed with the stark reality that confronts them when they arrive in `the city of angels'. However, the more important facades are those that present themselves in the characters. Everybody has a hidden agenda; everyone is more than they first appear, a 3-Dimensional character. Vincennes feels incredibly guilty over his corruption, White is smarter and more honourable than his brutish, psychotic appearance, Exley is determined to catch his `Rollo Tomasi' and Lynn Bracken is a woman who is afraid to give out her true self, hiding within her persona of a Veronica Lake look-alike call girl.The film supports a stellar ensemble cast who all deliver multi-dimensional powerhouse performances. Kevin Spacey was selected for his role with the advise by the director to `think Dean Martin'. As a result, Jack Vincennes plays slick and cool, the celebrity cop, but beneath this exterior he feels guilty over what he has become. Strangely, Australians played the other two lead roles of the American cops. Russel Crowe is both brutal and valiant as Bud White, injecting his role with force and power, but also preserving the character's virtues, underlying emotions and fragility, while Guy Pearce plays the by-the-book Ed Exley, displaying a mixture of strength, craving for power and muted goodwill. Kim Baisinger is vulnerable and enchanting in her Academy Award winning role as Lynn Bracken. James Cromwell is suitably harsh and manipulative as the Chief of Detectives and Danny DeVito rounds out the cast with his sleazy and conniving gossip rag reporter Sid Hugeons.In LA Confidential, most of the police are more corrupt than the criminals, and here lies the truth of the movie. LA Confidential is a story of corruption, false love, hatred, murder and lies in the city of Los Angeles, a story that attempts to expose the falsities fed to the American Public in the 1950s. Does it work? Undoubtedly. In 1997, LA Confidential walked away with the top awards from all film circles, except the Academy Awards, where it won Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress (Kim Baisinger), robbed of the top prize by the more popular but inferior Titanic. However, time is proving that LA Confidential was not just the best of 1997, but is one of the greatest crime movies of all time.",L.A. Confidential

Godfather, His Girl Friday, and L.A. Confidential.  This is how you make a perfect film.  Even the character names are great.  Pierce Patchet, Lynn Bracken, Bud White.  The scene between Bud and Lynn when he first shows up at her apartment rivals any Bogart/Bacall scene.This is also an amazing guy movie.  You have three representatives of the male, the slick smooth talker, the book worm, and the tough guy.  Almost every man can make himself fit into one of those roles and see the film through their eyes.  He also wishes, at various times, the he could be the other two.If it wasn't for Titanic this film would of AND should of swept every Oscar it was nominated for.

The police department is trying to clean up its image while staying in a corrupt town in a corrupt time.  Their reputation is however trashed once more in an internal drunken riot termed ""Bloody Christmas."" That's just the beginning, the spawn of the immense story, plot twists, and character development.  Each character in the film is drastically changed by his or her experiences.  The editing is always smooth and fast paced, and the cinematography always affixes the right mood.  The set pieces are distinct eye candy.  The soundtrack to this movie is a fine complement to the visuals.  It mixes authentic fifties music with a beautifully orchestrated score that keeps audiences on the edges of their seats. The acting performances for this movie are collectively some of the best ever produced for the silver screen.  The last time I've been this convinced of Characters was in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.""  Russell Crowe, Guy Pierce, Kevin Spacey, and Kim Basinger (Best Supporting Actress - 1997) give especially standout performances. Overall, L.A. Confidential is the total package.  It's superb at every angle.  It has been voted the third best film of the nineties by one critic's association, and it is my personal favorite.

Great plot, awesome atmosphere, great acting, great direction, amazing movie. Kevin Spacey rules, and so does Russell Crowe. Basically, everyone is well cast and does a great job, I don't think that Kim Basinger was the best, although she was the only one to get an award. Of course, that's because it was up for awards the same year as Titanic, and thus it had no chance, even though it is such a better movie, it almost makes me retch to compare the two.

Bud White (Russel Crowe) is the muscle man police officer,  lady in distress saving cop, and jack vincennes (kevin spacey) does the whole publicity inside tip cop business.Its based around several other cops and a Night Owl Restaurant Robbery/Murder, and the dirty business that goes along with being a detective.  This is a winding story that is hard to follow but after the second time that i saw this movie i caught on real quickly. i suggest this to those who love a good cop mystery, i really liked this.",L.A.

587,fair80,better than the book,8,9 October 2000,"I recently read James Ellroy's novel, and could not see how they could make a movie of it. It's huge and has three major plots. When I read the synopsis here on imdb, I rented the film. My husband, who has not read the book, and I both gave it an 8. The major plot line involving a Disney-like person that was discarded was no loss. It was a bit over the top. The movie is better without it. The characters were very true to the book, and I thought Kim Basinger was very good, but too old for the part. She's supposed to be about 28. Russell Crowe looked like a kid next to her.I liked the clear sound and the good light. It would have been very easy to make this dark and murky as has been the rage since the really fast films were invented.",L.A. Confidential

Anyone can be bribed, or blackmailed... or killed.L.A. Confidential is an exciting homage to pulp noire and it was just as entertaining upon rewatch as the first time I saw it. All the archetypes are there, the femme fatale, the bad cop, the corrupt politician, but the amazing cast brings so much life into these characters. The setting of the police station allows for great interactions, as I love watching characters who can't stand each other, have to work together. One minute detectives are fist fighting, the next they are cracking the case.Then to cap it all off you get a banger shootout. Goddamn this movie is great.",L.A. Confidential

Everything about this movie is right: the story, the acting, the music, the setting. Definitely one of my favorites. The three leading actors (Pearce, Crowe and Spacey)are all equally impressive and constant and even Basinger gives a good performance.  A MUST SEE!",L.A. Confidential
590,Stunner_laugh,A postmodern outlook on the police force in the 1950's,9,20 May 2001,"This has to be one of the best films of the 90's, with excellent hard-boiled dialogue, Crowe and Pearce are particularly subverssive in their own way and Basinger produces a superb depiction of a Marilyn Monroe hommage. Spacey again delivers a brillant performance in a postmodern film noir genre. The storyline shocks everybody but follows the conventions right to the wire. In my opinion this film should of won the oscar but was beaten by the dire Titanic minus Billy Zane. Basinger though well deserved her oscar. A must-see film.",L.A. Confidential
591,SteveTimko,"Good performance, but Kim Basinger is overrated",1,25 May 2001,"I don't see what the appeal of this movie is for so many people. I didn't think there was any chemistry at all between Kim Basinger and the detective, whose name slipped my mind. There were a few good performances, but not enough to make this movie a classic. For real chemistry, watch ""Sea of Love,"" ""The Big Easy"" or even ""Body Heat.""",L.A. Confidential
592,Davidmon5,Masterpiece,10,1 September 2003,"This incredible piece of work is my favorite film of all time, but no matter who you ask it ranks up there with the greatest. Hanson did a spectacular job adapting James Ellroy's novel, a complex detective yarn that is character (as opposed to plot) driven.  Presenting characters with such depth is truly an amazing feat...most screenwriters and directors would have botched any attempt to put this story on the big screen. Kim Basinger received an Oscar for her portrayal of Lynn, and while she delivers a solid performance, it's probably the least impressive in the film.  Everyone does a fantastic job, but Basinger was the only superstar at the time of release and was rewarded for choosing to participate in such an intelligent project.  The movie really launched the careers of Pierce and Crowe, and while Spacey's career had already been established, it was this role that cemented his place as one of the best contemporary American actors. Every single aspect of this noir film fits together perfectly, from the wonderful performances, the beautiful cinematography, the magnificent, amazingly complimentary soundtrack, the intriguing web-like storyline, and the expert timing and directing.  The movie explodes out of its genre, replacing the expected smoky, dingy backrooms with vivid colors.  The film brings an era to life that is normally dulled in our collective memory like an aging black-and-white photograph with an impressive effort made for authenticity.  The contrast between the deep dark depths of the human soul and the broad daylight imagery is pure brilliance. There is not a single traditional ""good guy"" in the entire movie, and yet it won't leave the observer apathetic about the outcome.  L.A. Confidential manages to evoke a range of emotions, exploring in depth the complex, dual human nature of many of its characters. This is a movie you can see over and over and get something new out of it every time.  If you've only seen parts of this movie, or don't remember it, go sit down with a bag of popcorn in a dark room and watch the whole thing start to finish.  And pay attention.  It will be well worth it.",L.A. Confidential

Once I sat with a pad of paper and kept track of what I thought was better in each scene, the writing or the acting, and I came up with a tie. Russell Crowe showed us all before ""The Insider"" what he was made of. Kim Basinger proved to all of us she is more than a pretty face. James Cromwell again reminded us he is one of the best character actors around. I had no idea who Guy Pierce was before this film and now I follow his career after this unbelievable performance. And Kevin Spacey...Kevin Spacey...Kevin Spacey...charming, classy, amazing, stole the movie. Rent this movie. If is wasn't released the same year as ""Titanic"" it would have won Best Picture.",L.A.

Especially Kim Basinger and Russel Crow in his first big Hollywood role. And of course the fitting music from veteran Jerry Goldsmith. As sad in my title this picture should have taken the big award back in 1997. Too bad another really great movie Titanic was involved. But you know the Titanic is the perfect popcorn Hollywood cinema you can think of (I mean it in a GOOD way, i love the movie). And that plays a lot for academy members even today. But really I take this beautiful, stylish noir detective story even over the masterful Goodfellas. Meaning it is in my opinion the best American movie of the 90s.

597,Fripitto,The best the 90's has to offer,10,7 June 2007,"Curtis Hanson's crime epic LA Confidential reaches back to the film noir of the 1950's and combines it with the best the 90's has to offer. The story, based on James Ellroy's novel, involves the investigation of a mass murder in an all night restaurant and the corruption and hypocrisy within the LAPD and the Justice department. The killers are sought by a trio of policemen: the flamboyant celebrity-cop Jack Vincennes (suavely played by Kevin Spacey), the sensitive brute 'Bud' White (Russell Crowe in a role he was born for) and the brilliant, but hated career-seeker Edmund Exley (one of Guy Pearce's best performances). When Lt. Exley gets honored after a dramatic shootout with the three Negro suspects, the case is closed. However, each of the three policemen are bothered by the feeling some things don't add up and they decide to dig for the truth. The deeper they dig, the filthier it gets and it all connects with hookers 'cut to look like movie-stars', a missing load of heroine and the murder of a young homosexual actor.The success of LA Confidential depended on many things: a great plot, fitting music by Jerry Goldsmith, adequate camera-work, exciting shootouts, etc. But the film will be remembered mostly because of its diversity of great supporting roles: the backstabbing reporter Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito), the respected police captain Dudley Smith (James Cromwell), the smooth pimp Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn) and the hooker Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger's Oscar-winning performance). The acting-chemistry and the thrilling plot form the solid core of this masterpiece, one that will last through the ages.",L.A. Confidential

Once again, a production in which the USA does not celebrate itself as the savior and benefactor of the whole world, but brings the weaknesses in its own system crystal clear to light. A cult film for all time and even 25 years later thematically not in the least dusty. Los Angeles is certainly far from being a city of angels even today. In my view, there are no negative aspects of the film to mention. So 10/10.",L.A. Confidential
599,sarion,The best police drama ever,10,19 September 2016,"One of the best if not the best movie in my personal pantheon of cinema's most precious jewels.This is the show of Kevin Spacey, who's performance is just amazing, especially when we can watch his inner personal change from slick, crooked cop to someone who try to get back his lost way.But what I love the most about this movie is Russel Crowe. I remember him from his very first movie - Roomper Stomper. Since than he create many of amazing movie characters, but his play in L.A. Confidential is just stunning. His rough, brutal character with dark history is great acted, I can almost feel his anger towards anyone who hurt woman.And even small things matters - everyone who know Rollo Tomassi, know what I am talking about...I have seen this one more than 20-30 times, lost count at some moment, but I know there are many more times to come, because I cannot get enough of good, old style police drama.",L.A.

600,InternetFamous,A film I've been wanting to see for an age...,9,29 April 2013,"Little has a police crime drama been portrayed so beautifully and executed so well, L.A. Confidential has everything required for a blockbuster thriller of this type: A majestic 50's L.A. backdrop; a straight-laced cop - and likewise, an unbridled one; a stunning blonde; A riveting murder case and numerous shoot-outs. As eager players of the video-game 'L.A. Noire' would know, creating a great backdrop is absolutely vital for a film like this, and both game and film really nailed it.A special credit to the casters, too, as Spacey plays the sleazy, egocentric cop far too well. This character was my favourite (although I would have liked to see some more action from him). As crime dramas go, the plot was not terribly complicated; A newly recruited police officer - Sergeant Edmund ""Ed"" Exley (Guy Pearce) is adamant he can become a legendary detective, just like his father. His intelligence, insistence on following regulations, and his cold demeanour contribute to his social isolation from other officers, which soon leaves him disliked amongst the division. Bud White (Crowe) plays the, and I quote (from Pearce's character), ""mindless thug"" and violent loving officer. Bud comes to dislike Ed after his partner, Dick Stensland, is fired due to Ed's testimony in the ""Bloody Christmas"" scandal. Bud is sought out by Dudley for a job intimidating out-of-town criminals trying to fill the void left in L.A. following the imprisonment of Mickey Cohen, the city's most successful and notorious gangster. The Nite Owl case becomes personal after Stensland is found to be one of the victims. Jack Vincennes (Spacey) moonlights as the technical adviser on Badge of Honor, a popular Dragnet-type TV crime program. He is also connected with Sid Hudgens (DeVito), publisher of Hush-Hush magazine, receiving kickbacks for tipping Sid off to celebrity arrests that will attract even more readers to the magazine. When a young actor winds up dead during one of these schemes, a guilt-ridden Jack is determined to find who did it. At different intervals, the three men investigate the Nite Owl killings and concurrent events which in turn begin to reveal indications of corruption all around them. Ed pursues absolute justice, all the while trying to live up to his family name. Bud pursues Nite Owl victim Susan Lefferts, which leads him to Lynn Bracken (Basinger), a Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute with ties to the case he and Ed are independently investigating. Meanwhile, Jack follows up on a pornography racket with ties to both the Nite Owl and Lynn's handler Pierce Patchett (Strathairn), operator of Fleur-de-Lis, a call-girl service that runs prostitutes altered by plastic surgery to resemble popular film stars.The story unfolds to reveal an unexpected twist - that LAPD Captain Dudley Smith (Cromwell) is behind all of it.In conclusion then, the plot was rather simple, but effective and capped off a fantastic neo-noire film that any fan of these iconic ""noire"" type crime dramas should be sure to watch.",L.A.

Three police detectives investigate a number of murders in order to uncover the truth.Each has his signature way of serving justice, but as the story goes on, they each have to face their own convictions. How far are they prepared to go?Bud white (played by Russel Crowe) doesn't always follow the rules by the book and has a though time keeping of controlling his more violent nature.Then there is his counterpart Ed Exley (played by Guy Pearce). An ambitious man who wants to get ahead without breaking the rules. A challenge which he finds becomes harder and harder on his way to the top.Last but not least, we have Jack Vincennes (played by Kevin Spacey).

Not because Cameron asked for a minute of silence (something even Spielberg didn't request for the holocaust after winning for Schindlers List) and not because I knew LA Confidential wasn't going to sweep the acting awards like it deserved because neither Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe or James Cromwell were nominated. I was shocked and stunned that LA Confidential was beaten to the top oscars by Titanic. It was a truly undeserving victory. LA Confidential has some seriously heavyweight acting performances. Right through Danny DeVito and Kim Basinger who did win for her performance as Lynn Bracken. Russell Crowe is simply brilliant there are no other words to describe him. Kevin Spacey is every bit as good in this as anything he's done before or since it. I can't recommend this movie enough.",L.A. Confidential
606,Therem,Riveting character drama & killer plot,10,10 September 1998,"L.A. Confidential restored my faith in the possibilities of movie-making. (I periodically need that.) It succeeded in so many ways that I can't really imagine how it could have been better. The motivations and actions of the characters are so coherent that they seem like real people, and the movie gets better with each viewing (on the third viewing I was still catching details I had missed previously).The truth behind the Nite Owl killings is entertainingly slow to come to light, but my favorite element of the movie was the psychological complexity of the characters, particularly Ed Exley and Bud White. You can feel Exley being tempted to become what he hates and the outcome is in doubt every step of the way. But for me Bud White is the most compelling person in the film, simmering with angry purpose but far more aware than people take him to be. If I cared at all about the Oscars I would say that Russell Crowe deserved a best actor award for this role, but since I don't I will merely say he's absolutely wonderful and everyone should see this film.Someone else mentioned watching this film with Chinatown as a double bill. I did just that last weekend and found that Chinatown seemed flat in comparison. Though I had to respect it for going for a more obviously grim ending than L.A. Confidential did I was not as involved with the characters. Perhaps that was part of its point. But I know which one I'll be buying on video.",L.A. Confidential

Confidential is, without a doubt, the best film of the 1990s, and quite possibly one of the best films ever made.As with any great film, it all starts with the writing.  The story is riveting, the dialogue is smart and quite funny, and the characters are written in three dimensions.The acting is phenomenal.  Perhaps a bigger tragedy than L.A. Confidential's loss to Titanic in the Best Picture race is that none of the three lead actors even garnered nominations.  Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, and Kevin Spacey are absolutely phenomenal; it is their characters that drive this fascinating story about police corruption in 1950s Los Angeles.  We get to know these people, to understand who they are and why they do what they do, and to root for them to overcome their imperfections.The directing is fantastic.  Curtis Hanson doesn't shove anything in the audience's face; instead, he allows the audience to discover the film's nuances on their own.  (That makes this an excellent film for repeat viewings, you truly catch something new every time).  1950s Los Angeles is reproduced beautifully.  The editing is quick and seamless, the music is perfect for the film (Hanson should teach other directors how to do a montage effectively), and the cinematography is great.I can't find a negative thing to say about this film.

Forget the old stereotypes - good cop/bad cop, buddy cop movies and the rest. This takes all of those and twists them out of all recognition. Every character has his or her lovable side but you end up resenting the fact that you like them because of various other angles of their personalities.The ensemble cast is superb! Kevin Spacey is on form as ever, Russell Crowe deservedly broke into Hollywood with this role and, hopefully, so will the excellent and much underrated Guy Pearce. And as for Kim Basinger, well, having thought of her acting as a somewhere between mildly amusing and downright irritating for some years I have had to re-evaluate and now think she's totally amazing. Talk about versatility! Even the ever type-cast Danny DeVito is splendid as the narrator and two-bit hack who coins the title to the movie.The friend who made me watch the movie is now living in delighted smugness in the fact that I have to admit that this has to be my favourite film of all time and also that I have watched it at least a dozen times.Just two words can now set the hairs on the back of my neck on end (you'll understand if you watch it) - ""Rolo Tamasi""!",L.A.

What was the most impressed for me was, of course the story was amazingly good, but how Kim Basinger was beautiful, attractive, and sexy. Was she really 43years old at that time? I hardly believed how old she was. Who can resist her temptation? I envy her beauty.",L.A. Confidential
624,tredthreads,This was the best....,10,11 June 2006,"Really one of the best films I have ever seen, I can not praise it enough! Kevin Spacey was masterful, his method was flawless. Russell Crowe was fabulous. I didn't see this when it came out because I didn't like Kim Bassinger, but I should have seen it when it came out despite it. I would have had almost a decade to love it. It really gives me such admiration for Kevin Spacey his style and flair, God he was born to act; I want to see him win more Academy Awards. It was well told and had suspense that had me at the edge of my seat. It makes me want to study the time period more. I am going to get the book to see if it is even better read than movie. A++++ It is a MUST SEE MOVIE.",L.A. Confidential
625,prodigal wolf,L.A. Confidential is AWESOME!,10,26 May 2001,"This is perhaps the best movie I have ever seen.  Better than Titanic any day, it is rare to see a Hollywood movie revolving around character development to the extent that L.A. Confidential does.Kevin Spacey is awesome as the L.A.P.D. version of Dean Martin.  Suave, sophisticated, intelligent - by far the most intriguing of the cast. Russell Crowe is excellent as the muscle cop Bud White.  I find Guy Pierce irritating, though - must be because I'm Aussie and Crowe is heaps better anyway!  James Cromwell certainly exudes the aura expected of a Chief of Detectives and I like the development of the relationship between himself and Exley.  Other names on the honour roll include Kim Basinger and Danny DeVito.But it is not enough to describe the main characters.  There are SO MANY characters and sub-plots throughout the movie, so many subtleties that you need to watch it several times to pick everything up.  It is such an intense and absorbing movie experience, entertaining, thrilling and an almost flawlessly accurate portrayal of L.A. and the L.A.P.D. in the 1950's.I don't want to say any more as I may reveal too much and spoil the most awesome movie of the last two decades (at least).  It redefines the expression of a MUST SEE!  Watch it and absorb it and fall head-over-heels in love with it, just like me.",L.A. Confidential
626,georgiii-47061,A modern classic,10,27 November 2020,"Faultless modern film noir. 10/10. Outstanding performances by Russel Crowe and Kim Basinger, the likes of which they never reached again before or subsequently!",L.A. Confidential
627,pizza_monkey,Best picture of 1997,10,6 February 2007,"Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce and James Cromwell turn in excellent performances as warped-out cops in LA-LA land, 1950's style. Each of these actors deserved an Oscar for his performance. At least the academy gave an Oscar to Kim Basinger for best supporting actress for her superb performance as a high-priced Hollywood hooker. There are a lot of great reviews on this movie, so I'm not going to rehash the story. Suffice it to say that the story is well crafted and all of the characters are completely believable.There is a lot of violence in this movie, on-screen and off, but none of it is gratuitous. IMHO Kim Basinger's beauty was pretty much ""past peak"" by the time this movie was made. Even so, she is deliciously gorgeous in the flick, and perfect for the part. There isn't any actual sex in this movie. Most pervs would agree that there could have been more soft-core action, but I for one believe it would've taken away from the super-fast action of the movie. Russell Crowe's Bud White grabs EVERY scene by the cojones. Guy Pearce's Edmund Exley is like that guy you used to give a wedgie to during recess every day back in junior high. The next day he'd come back for more, feisty as ever, like a darned banty rooster. Eventually, once you got to know him, you decided he wasn't such a bad guy after all, and maybe you were wrong to pull the elastic from his underwear clean over his head. Kevin Spacey's Jack Vincennes scene with the Captain is unforgettable. Vincennes' mention of ""Rollo Tomasi"" is reminiscent of his ""Keyser Soze"" from the ""The Usual Suspects."" James Cromwell plays LA Police Captain Dudly Smith in such convincing fashion that he had to play Farmer Hoggett in ""Babe, Pig in the City"" in order to avoid being permanently typecast in the role. Still, while watching ""Babe, Pig in the City,"" I kept thinking there was going to be a plot twist, and Farmer Hoggett was going to set Babe up or something worse. It's almost ten years now and I still enjoy watching LA Confidential at least once per year. ""Titanic"", which won almost all the awards for 1997, just sits on the shelf, accumulating dust. Maybe I'll watch it again in about ten years.",L.A. Confidential
628,thegame_hhh90,Simple and the truth,10,24 January 2002,"In a crazy hollywood world of special effects and huge budgets which normally overrun, this film looks so effortlessly made that it brings us an amazing slice of real(even though its in the past) life. All the performances in my opinion were oscar worthy especially that of an exciting new actor called Russell Crowe as he was virtually unknown when this film came out. The plot and relevant subplots are intertwined so well you wont notice them until the film has finished and you realise that the true evil has been staring you in the face. The ability to control so many mini plots at once without losing the audience is an amazing gift that is on display as all are equally interesting and equally important to the main story. when the film finishes you will stare at the screen and simply say wow!",L.A.

629,movie_plotter,Great Script,9,1 February 2008,"I love this movie. it has a very, very good script. There is a wonderful Set-ups and pay off. I didn't read the novel, and I don't feel i should do, the movie is just fine. I liked the most is the three main characters in the movie, We almost know everything about them in a few scenes. I noticed the way they changes step by step so the ending would be understandable easily. i was amazed by the craft and the way the screenplay was written. I still watch this movie to learn a lot about the screenplay. Very Good indeed. i think we should treat this movie as a new-noir, and we can notice that from the mood of the movie, the characters, the mix of right and wrong in them. i think there is a link between this movie and ""Chinatown"", it contain the same theme, and i mean the same city, the small crimes that leads to BIG crimes. I Liked That Movie.",L.A. Confidential
630,lecter7,I Got Chills,10,3 October 2005,"I believe, as I imagine many fans of LA Confidential do, that the only reason this film did not receive the Oscar for Best Picture is due to the fact that Titanic was released the same year. That is why I have refused, to this very day, to view Titanic in its entirety. I walked out of the theater after seeing LA Confidential(and after reading the book a few years prior) saying to my fellow confidants in attendance that ""that was a movie."" The sets, music, costumes, action, acting, directing, and plain noir feel makes it a classic in every way. The bottom line is that I would recommend this movie in the most enthusiastic way, and also say that I wish every film could make me feel the same way when I leave the theater...",L.A. Confidential
631,Joker74,Extremely boring,1,30 March 2003,"I'm sorry to say this, but this movie lost me after 10-20 minutes, and it never caught my attention again. I see alot of ppl like this movie, but I found it really boring. For me it didn't have anything. It didn't have good action scenes, interesting story, and besides I don't like the 1950-style. If it only had some underlying symbolism or something like that... I think that symbolism in a movie should strike u clearly; u shall feel there is something more. But no, it didn't have a striking symbolism either. Just a straight forward story about some dirty cops catching some very dirty cops (all the cops in this movie I would say was dirty).The only reason I watched the whole movie, and didn't stop watching after 10-20 minutes, was that a pal of mine told me that it was not a movie with ""brainless action"" that one should stop watching after merely 20 minutes just because I didn't like it. So i had a real boring time forcing me to watch it almost to the end. I skipped the last 10 minutes; it was not like anything supprising would happen that made up for the past 2 hours of bordome.I would give this movie 1.5 on a scale from 0 to 10.",L.A. Confidential

634,Guvera,A fitting tribute to a classic genre.,8,11 May 2014,"There is so much to be said about 'L.A Confidential' the majority of which I must say is positive. Based on a novel from 1990, this suspenseful, dramatic and compelling homage to the film noire era of the 1940s and 50s was expertly brought to life by director Curtis Hanson, who gave his characteristically edgy vibe to the movie.Above all the acting was superb. With headliners like Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey and Guy Pearce the film's casting director needs a serious pack on the back. Russel Crowe's character Wendell White grew from a violent one dimension-ed character to something far more complex. Like wise Guy Pearce's Edmund Exley learned that to achieve justice sometimes laws have to be broken. Though I am a huge fan of Spacey and I cannot fault his acting here or elsewhere for that matter, it was his character that I saw as the most simple. When the other characters were seemingly growing as the story of the Nite Owl killings unraveled Kevin's Jack Vincennes seemingly went along for the ride as his ambitious semi- corrupt nature did not change at all.One of the few other qualms I had with this film was the ending. Without going into too many of the specifics I disliked the fact that Exley became even more ambitious, the confusing fact that White survived and even worst that he ended up with Kim Basinger's Lynn Bracken. Not to say that I disliked Lynn or Basinger's acting, both were complex and provocative, but I felt that the film was screaming, SCREAMING, for a 'femme fatale'. A 'femme fatale' is a staple of the film noire genre and his french for deadly female. Simply it is a seductive attractive woman who is ultimately evil. I felt the way we were drawn into her personal story, whilst seeing her give in to the mob boss's wants and needs set the audience (myself included) up perfectly to fall for, and subsequently be shocked by, the betrayal of a 'femme fatale' so when this did not deliver I was left slightly disappointed. That said it is more of a personal nit pick than a critical issue.Is it worth watching? Yes. Definitely yes. This film is not just an expertly crafted crime thriller, it is seriously entertaining. Its shocking and absorbing. One of the best films of my life time.",L.A. Confidential
635,kdixon316,Film Noir Brilliance,9,30 November 2011,"L.A Confidential is a classic crime noir film with an outstanding cast who give an excellent performance. The intriguing story is set in 1950s Los Angeles where three cops supposed to work together with very different views of the law go about dispensing their own versions of justice.The cast is brilliant with some of the best acting talent of the 90s. Crowe plays the aggressive Bud White. Spacey is Jack Vincennes, a man who enjoys his work as an adviser to a police drama more than his actual police work and Pearce who plays Edmund Exley, a new up and coming officer who tries to play things by the book in a police force that has long since abandoned any such notions.All three are soon caught up in a web of lies and deceit as the audience attempts to figure out what happened right along with them. But looks can be deceiving and who do you believe when everyone seems to have something to hide?Overall an enjoyable crime noir with more than it's fair share of twists and turns in this complex tale full of believable characters.",L.A.

637,jack-reid,Excellent Film,9,30 March 2012,"I loved this ""L.A. Confidential"", I thought it was awesome. The way the movie is set up so that you are forced to discover things as the main characters do was a great element. I also liked the way the reputation of Exley's character changed. At first he was seen as a whiney little brat just trying to get ahead. But slowly he began to earn respect with the other officers. And soon he was being known as shotgun Ed. I also liked Russell Crowe's character a lot too. The idea of a guy who goes around defending helpless women was an interesting addition and sometimes comical. For instance when the suspects from the night owl murder case begin to talk about attacking some girl Russell begins to tense up then BAM the chair in front of him snaps like a twig under the stress of his hands and he flies like a bat out of hell to try and learn how to save a girl in need. In the end the movie creates a very good story.",L.A. Confidential

639,edithsamson,Excellent!,9,17 May 2012,"""L.A. Confidential"" is riveting from start to absolute finish. The interesting thing is that it is obviously set in Los Angeles; and I personally hate Los Angeles (I used to live there), but this is Los Angeles in a supernatural reality. There's nothing overtly amazing about this movie, but its almost as if you imagine every villain in this movie to be a demon (and the villains aren't always cut and dried, even the ""heroes"" are suffering from some type of pathos). In terms of my favorite Russell Crowe movie, this is it. I can't remember if they actually describe him in the movie as being all brawn and no brain; but that exactly describes his character. This is the first movie that I ever saw Guy Pearce in, and I fell in love with his acting ability. Kim Basinger is great too, and her acting is ironically understated. I lived in L.A. for quite some number of years, but this is an L.A. that I'm not really used to; but definitely like. There is a really strong visual component to the movie. Very vivid.",L.A.

640,silbersam,Perfect,10,1 February 2007,"The best American film of the 1990s, the movie that made me believe in Hollywood again. The movie that jump-started Kiam Basinger's second chance and the movie that proved the star power of Russell Crowe. The characters played by both of them are profoundly human, flawed yet endearing, and they deliver lines that blow you away, as good as anything Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall delivered in ""The Big Sleep"". The twists and turns of the plot keep you nailed to your seat and there are scenes so suddenly surprising that the first time you see them you don't believe your eyes. Kevin Spacey shines as a cop who thinks he's cool and who can be bought for a penny, while Danny de Vito reminds us that he can be a great actor as a quick-buck pathetic journalist who makes a profit of exposing human weakness to gossip and scandal oblivious of the lives he ruins day after day. David Strathairn makes a mark with an almost invisible role, James Cromwell gives an Academuy-award giving performance and Guy Pierce breaks through as a glassy-eyed careerist who wins acclaim and loses his soul as he pushes his way up the ranks of the L.A. police force. The only way to succeed in the city of fallen angels is corruption, to follow the devil's advice and to ""lose the glasses, boyo."" To climb up in this town you need to freefall down. There's no success like failure -I'm quoting Dylan-- and failure's no success at all.",L.A. Confidential
641,ntsuhi,Overrated!,7,22 July 2016,I found it overrated! I think there are many other movies that should be in top 250 list. Probably three great actors starred in this film that is why it is in the list. Kevin did a very good work though I must admit. But Russel was not suitable for the role I guess. People might have different opinion. But honestly I didn't think it is a great movie. The story was a bit shaky. I saw in the reviews that many people found this movie fantastic. I don't think it is THAT great. It is an average movie. I expected more from this film. I love Guy Pearce. He is a very good actor. He did a great job I must say! I loved his acting here. He was totally into the character. The only thing I loved about this movie was Guy Pearce.,L.A. Confidential
642,systemrider,A fantastic take on the Noir/Crime genre that pleases and surprises,10,3 July 2013,"L.A. Confidential is an excellent film that immerses the viewer with an excellent grasp on atmosphere, music, and characters, which helps fill the movie with very satisfying feel. While the movie's pace may come in to question for some, I felt that the exponential growth in pacing was more than appropriate for this kind of film, few films in the modern era are able to capture the magic of the genre that is Noir, and even fewer seem to do it while still remaining in it's investigator story style roots, The actors are apparently well aware of the role the are seeking to fill and that knowledge is another amazing aspect of L.A. Confidential because the acting is attuned for the genre, The mixture of all these well adjusted aspects makes it a classic and enjoyable film.",L.A. Confidential
643,Killamangiro262,Amazing...,10,8 January 2005,"One of the best films I've ever had the pleasure to see. As a fan of film noir this film entertained me perhaps more than it could people who aren't fans of the genre. The characters were handled brilliantly; at first we believe them all to be straight ahead characters: Ed Exley the slimy, but always clean cut, good guy, Bud White, a brutal thug who believes in violence as a way of stopping crime, and Jack Vincennes, a cop only there for the glamour. Eventually though, we see how their viewpoints change, and evidently, why they turned out the way they did. Aside from the characterisation of the film, the storyline itself astounded me. The many twists and turns came together at the end, leaving even the most tiny hint extremely important to anyone trying to work out the story. Overall, I loved this film for many reasons; the amazing story, the depth of the characters, the cinematography & music, which both conveyed a feeling of noir, the supporting cast (Danny DeVito, Kim Basinger, and James Cromwell were all great) and even, the small gleans of humour throughout, such as when Ed Exley confronts Johnny Stompanato and a Lana Turner look-a-like prostitute, only to find out, it actually is Lana Turner. The best film of the 90s, and one which cannot be recommended enough. If only more films had followed its lead...",L.A. Confidential
644,donovanj-1,Human morality,9,18 January 2005,"LA Confidential is a complex study of human morality from several perspectives. For example, Ed Exley sets out as an idealistic young recruit, alarmed at the vicarious pleasure taken by the inebriated policemen administering mob justice on 'cop killer' suspects. Eventually, this idealism is eroded as he first 'rats' on his colleagues and ultimately bribes the city for another promotion following the demise of Captain Dudley Smith.From a different perspective, Bud White's morality shifts from that of a thug to a protector; he is painfully aware of the consequences of domestic abuse, yet cannot stop himself from striking Lynn Bracken. He also hands over the money he finds in the wallet of the aptly (because of the flies harrying his rotting corpse) Buzz Meakes.Then there's Hollywood Jack Vincennes - he kicks off as an arrogant TV cop taking backhanders from Sid Hudgens - but ultimately, his conscience engineers his doom; and yet brings down the wily Dudley Smith.Outstanding movie.",L.A.

I am still sore that Titanic won best picture over it. Virtually all critics agreed it was better than that extra long sappy romance. The acting by everyone involved was impeccable, I have yet to see a movie since that has brought back the feel of the glory days of Hollywood like this one. I rate it as one of my 10 best movies of all time. Easily one of the best of the last 15 yrs.Kim Basinger's performance was great, and this film launched the career of Guy Pearce and even Russel Crowe.

Confidential"" is one of the rare films where almost everything is perfect; the clothes, the cars, the music, the locations, not to mention the performances; combine to make this movie one of those all-time bests that you must have in your collection. The story itself is extremely tight (given the giant book from which it was adapted). The movie is ""visually lush"", the characters well portrayed; then considering the twists in the plot (which are admittedly less surprising on repeated viewings) you can watch it repeatedly and continue to appreciate it. No detail of the production was over-looked. It is a film that fits right in with other ""near-perfect"" classics from Hollywood's history, such as ""The Sting"", ""Sunset Boulevard"" (for two disparate examples) while making use of all the advantages available to a modern master film-maker (Mr. Hansen).

Despite what the title suggest, La Confidential is neither Spanish nor feminine. Filled with drugs, violence, and prostitutes, one wonders why the movie wasn't titled El Confidential.Set in the fictional city of La, Curtis Hanson's adaptation of James McElroy's novel sports a story filled with mystery and deceit. If you have trouble following the twisted plot, as many will, you can still enjoy the movie because of the characters developed well by their creators and acted well by their actors. Both Crowe and Spacey are at their best and their characters seem to fuel the movie more than the at-times-hazy plot.Because of excessive violence I can't recommend this movie to any of the la's out there, but most el's will find it a blast.",L.A.
