0,Leofwine_draca,"Adequate thriller, nothing more",5,3 February 2020,"ESCAPE ROOM is a generic kind of thriller that trades on the newfound popularity of thriller experiences, in which a group of friends willingly allow themselves to be locked in escape rooms before solving puzzles to facilitate their escape. A real-life CRYSTAL MAZE, if you will. I've seen a previous and very similar B-movie that wasn't very good, but this one is more mainstream and bigger budgeted, so there's more emphasis on effects. I found it quite similar to that '90s cult classic CUBE, although of course nowhere near as good, lacking as it does interesting characters and only tending to generate a minimum of suspense despite all the screaming and shouting.",Escape Room
1,SnoopyStyle,room designs,5,3 September 2019,"Six strangers are given mystery boxes that invite them to win $10k. Each one arrive at an office building. As they wait in a room, they find the door locked with the heat rising. They struggle to escape and find themselves trapped in a series of elaborate rooms.This reminds me of Cube. At least in that one, the movie doesn't waste time introducing the characters. The opening foreshadowing sequence reveals almost everything. I kept waiting for a surprise reveal that the other competitors were not actually killed. Maybe they deliberately did not show a irrevocable death on screen to highlight a red herring. I don't care about these people. They are annoying. Everybody has a rude comment or a sly joke. The group dynamics could work with one jerk but almost everybody seems to have a jerk mode. They need to chill. As for the room designs, they are the most appealing aspect of the movie. They are fascinating although the clues are basically random. In Cube, there is actually something to solve. In this one, there isn't much to solve. I also hate that the players don't try to bring useful items from one room to another. It's rather unrealistic that everybody walks out of the cabin into the woods without grabbing a blanket or rug. At the very least, someone would brace the door open. The room designs are inventive and pretty fun. That keeps my interest until the end.",Escape Room
2,Prismark10,Escape Room,6,8 February 2020,"Six people receive a mysterious box. It contains a chance to win ten thousand dollars. As the strangers arrive in a nondescript building and wait in a reception area.They certainly find themselves locked in a series of escape rooms with fiendish traps and small clues. However this is no game, the penalty for failure is death.Escape Room is reminiscent of the cult movie Cube. There are hints that the six people could be trapped in purgatory. We see flashbacks that they were all involved in some life threatening event where they may or could had perished.Escape Room in its own term is better than a lot of low budget horror/thrillers. It is not as gory or nasty as the Saw movies.It is competently entertaining with a subtext regarding pleasing the elites.",Escape Room
3,nogodnomasters,Follow the Light to Green Pastures.,8,27 January 2019,"The film opens with Ben (Logan Miller ) being crushed and then goes back to three days earlier. We are introduced to three people who have the potential of being the ""Final Girl."" One of which is Ben. Zoey (Taylor Russell) is a super smart student and Jason (Jay Ellis) is a shrewd businessman. They and others get a personal invitation to try the Minos Escape Room for a chance of a $10,000 prize. The rooms can be deadly as they soon discover and the numbers whittle down.We get to know more personal information at 66 minutes into the film as we discover a reason for the madness.How many films have the title ""Escape Room"" right now? It seems the craze has pushed the success of any film with the title, almost as bad as the numerous ""Truth or Dare"" films. Then there is ""No Escape Room."" Guess how that one ends Scooby-doo? Sorry for the spoiler.I admit I rather enjoyed the film. It is not really horror, but more of a thriller. I wish they had spent more time on the clues so the viewers could play along, but as it was, the pace was unreasonably fast.Guide: A couple of F-words I missed. No sex or nudity.",Escape Room
4,kosmasp,Escape Cube,7,7 June 2019,"Or Cube meets Saw - sort of. I have not been to an Escape Room yet, but I do hope they are not like this ... the movie sets the mood from the start though! We get to see what the people who get involved in this have to face. And let me tell you: it is grim and it is violent! So not for the faint of hearted as you should be able to tell.It is tough to comment on acting, because this puts its characters in extreme situations (literally) and that is where it draws its drama from. If that sounds like something you like to see and experience (in movie form that is, completely seperated from reality), then the movie is something for you to watch. And everyone involved does a great job. Effects are good and even though we have to have token bad and good people, the chemistry also works overall",Escape Room
5,Sleepin_Dragon,I'm surprised at how good this film is.,8,30 December 2020,"I was adamant that I had seen this film, until I realised I had seen a film a few years back, called Escape Room, with virtually the same plot, the difference, being that was poor, this was actually really good.It's up there with Saw in terms of quality, it truly is a good thriller film, I wouldn't class it as a horror, it has tones, but ultimately lacks the scares.The format is unoriginal, but the delivery, acting, production and finished products are all really good. The only thing that didn't work quite so well for me was the ending, but in nitpicking here, it was a very good film, I wasn't expecting to like it, I thoroughly enjoyed it. 8/10.",Escape Room
6,classicsoncall,"""You can't contain your world forever.""",7,10 August 2020,"Tell you what, I'm almost seventy years old and I never heard of an escape room. I just did an internet search and found out that this sort of immersive group game actually exists. The thing is, what responsible business or entertainment company makes it their business model to kill their customers? Granted, the invitations to the six participants in this particular escape room didn't involve pay for play, but still. It takes a certain demented mind to get off on the torture and death of others. So with unlimited resources, I guess some major reprobates could pull something like this off.Going in I couldn't really tell in which direction this story would go specifically, but pretty much knew from the start that Zoey (Taylor Russell) would be a survivor. Even when she 'died' I figured there would be some room in the script to make it negotiable. I didn't see two survivors coming out of the game, so that was a bit of a twist. The various room scenarios were pretty creative, although the winter scene with the snow and ice cast all probability out of the picture for me.The ending of the story sets up the opportunity for a sequel in which Zoey and Ben (Logan Miller) try to get the goods on the Games Master and Puzzle Maker. I'd probably tune in to see how that one turns out, but I'm not holding my breath.",Escape Room
7,jboothmillard,Escape Room,5,4 November 2019,"These days, everyone is trying an escape room, so it is very appropriate to have a scary movie about one, I was told this was a pretty decent film, directed by Adam Robitel (Insidious: The Last Key). Basically, six strangers with varied backgrounds are sent a puzzle cube, each solve it, and are invited by the Minos Corporation to take part in an escape room with a $10,000 prize. These six people are physics student Zoey Davis (Taylor Russell), wealthy daytrader Jason Walker (Jay Ellis), grocery store stock boy Ben Miller (Logan Miller), truck driver Mike Nolan (Tyler Labine), Iraq War veteran Amanda Harper (True Blood's Deborah Ann Woll), and gamer and escape room enthusiast Danny Khan (Nik Dodani). The participants arrive at an office block and gather in the waiting room, waiting for the Gamemaster to arrive, but nobody comes. Ben tries to leave, but the door handle falls off, revealing that the challenge has begun. The room turns out to be a giant oven that begins to heat up. The players discover how to unlock an escape passage, using weight activated table coasters, and climb out before the room is filled with fire. Danny is convinced that it is still a game, and there is no foul play. Next the group find themselves in a winter cabin, where Ben deduces how to open the door. They step out into a room that appears to be an icy wilderness, with a small wood and a large lake, one jacket to keep them warm, and the temperature is dropping. Trying to find the key or a way out, Danny falls through the ice and drowns. They find the key, which is trapped in a block of ice, they use their body temperature to melt it down. Some players notice reminders of their traumatic events of the past. The remaining five players enter an upside-down billiards bar, where parts of the floor periodically fall into a deep shaft below. They realise the room contains a giant sliding puzzle, and the missing 8 ball is the key. Amanda retrieves the ball and throws it to Jason before plummeting to her death. The next room is a hospital ward with six beds, each representing a player. It is revealed that all of the six players were each sole survivors of various disasters: Ben survived a car crash, Jason escaped a shipwreck, Mike escaped a collapsed mine, Zoey survived a plane crash, Danny survived when his family died of carbon monoxide poisoning, and Amanda survived an IED blast. Zoey deduces that the purpose of the game is to determine which player is the luckiest of all. Jason discovers that the room is about to be filled with poisonous gas. Zoey refuses to continue playing and instead destroys the room's surveillance cameras. It is suggested that someone needs to record a certain heart rate for the players to escape. Mike has the highest heart rate, but not high enough to work. Jason suggests using the defibrillator on an unwilling Mike, Jason manipulates him by mentioning the mining tragedy. Jason accidentally kills Mike with a shock. He then solves the puzzle when the gas is released. Jason and Ben escape, but Zoey refuses to follow and disappears into the gas. Jason and Ben enter a room with optical illusions and strobe lights. While drugged with a hallucinogen, they fight over an antidote. Ben kills Jason and injects himself with the antidote. He then falls into the last room, where a wall moves inwards to crush him. Meanwhile, in the hospital room, the escape room employees enter to dispose of the dead bodies. Zoey jumps up and attacks them. Ben solves the last room and meets The Gamemaster, WooTan Yu (Yorick van Wageningen), who controls the game that the Puzzle Maker designed. The Gamemaster explains that each year they lure in players with something in common, and wealthy viewers bet on the result. The Gamemaster tries to kill Ben, but Zoey intervenes, and together they kill The Gamemaster. As Ben recovers, Zoey returns to the building with a detective. The police do not believe Zoey, as all evidence of the game has disappeared. Ben is not believed either, as drugs are detected in his system. While looking at the graffiti on the wall, Zoey notices the words ""No Way Out"", an anagram for ""Wootan Yu"", suggesting the game is not over. Six months later, Zoey meets up with Ben. Newspapers have passed off the other players' deaths as accidents. Ben suggests they should move on, but Zoey refuses to do so. Ben agrees to join Zoey as they travel to Manhattan to follow clues that point to an unlisted building. However, the mysterious Puzzle Maker is already preparing to make their flight a new deadly game of survival. Also starring Kenneth Fok as Detective Li. Russell, Miller and the others give strong performances, a familiar day experience for families and friends is twisted into a dark and twisted mystery, the pace of this film almost never slows down, it is definitely the elaborate rooms that create the most excitement, especially the upside down room, a satisfactory enough horror thriller. Worth watching!",Escape Room
8,Coventry,Where can I sign up my colleagues?,5,1 September 2021,"When I hear or read the words ""Escape Room"", I automatically think about those horrible - and sadly mandatory - team building activities I had to participate in the past couple of years. Escape Rooms are undoubtedly one of the most annoying and useless hypes of the 2010's. Few things in life are more irritating than having to solve stupid puzzles with people you can barely stand, only to discover that the answer to the puzzle leads you towards a new and even bigger puzzle. Giving the concept of the game, it obviously was just a matter of time before an Escape Room would get used as a location or as a gimmick in a horror film. It's a concealed space full of potential torturing devices; so basically, just a blending between ""Cube"" and ""Saw"". Between 2017-2019, at least three or four uninspired horror movies centering around escape rooms were released. They don't even bother to come up with a decent title and are all called ""Escape Room"".Until now, I had only seen a 2017-version written and directed by Will Wernick. It was awful, and I'll gladly admit this 2019 film (by Adam Robitel) is a massive improvement. This particular ""Escape Room"" has the best rating, the most favorable reviews and already turned out successful enough to have spawned a sequel. The stories of all ""Escape Room"" films are identical, obviously, but there are at least some likable characters in this one, and the writers undertook some effort to give them a bit of intellect, emotional depth and background. The deaths aren't excessively gruesome or bloody, but still painful enough for me to want and subscribe some colleagues I cannot stand. It's still predictable nonsense, though, as it takes far too long before the players realize their little game is deadly serious, and the ""twist"" at the end is blatantly stolen from a certain Eli Roth film released in 2005.",Escape Room
9,george.schmidt,Entertaining hybrid of SAW & FINAL DESTINATION,7,30 January 2019,"ESCAPE ROOM (2019) **1/2 Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Jay Ellis, Tyler Labine, Deborah Ann Woll, Nik Dodani. Relatively ingenious and entertaining horror thriller about a group of strangers invited mysteriously to test a maze of rooms involving high stakes - their mortality - by outwitting the dangerous games designed in order to survive by banding together. The screenplay by Bragi F. Schut and Maria Melnik incorporate cookie cutter roles with a mix of 'Saw' via 'Final Destination' and Adam Robitel's sharp direction keeps things lively.",Escape Room
10,view_and_review,"Been There, Done That",6,10 October 2019,"Moving on from my defense of escape rooms, this movie is nothing unique in the least. This movie has been done several times before in different forms, but now they've titled it ""Escape Room"" to be contemporary and capitalize on a contemporary form of recreation. This movie is essentially a modern version of Cube--the idea of having to solve puzzles to exit a room of death.Then there are the movies Saw, Die, Hunger, Hostel, Would You Rather, The Belko Experiment, Kill Theory, 13 Sins, and others which are all predecessors to this in one form or another.This movie and the others I mentioned are fun, but I have a major problem with one part of the story lines. I hate the Illuminati aspect of these types of movies. It's so tired to conjure up an individual or group of individuals that are so powerful that they can concoct these expensive elaborate death traps for simple entertainment. And even more than the wanton spending on people and equipment just to kill is the divine ability to know intimate details of a person's life so as to recreate horrible situations they were in. I wouldn't care how much money you have there are certain things that are just unknowable unless you are God Almighty. Now, if they go for a paranormal angle then I can understand, but to believe a team of clandestine people can gather mountains of intimate details on people, recreate said details, then lure those people into the detailed trap--it's too far-fetched.Again, Escape Room is fun, but so were all of the other movies before it. I give it an eight on the fun scale and a zero on the originality scale.",Escape Room
11,Wizard-8,"Not dull, but very hard to swallow",4,10 October 2019,"It seems the maker of this movie got quite a bit of inspiration from past movies, most notably ""Saw"" and ""Cube"". Those two aforementioned movies managed to be effective at times despite being made with really low budgets. So it's really strange to realize that ""Escape Room"" is much less effective despite having a much higher budget. I think that having much more money backfired because it caused these filmmakers to go ""wild"", having much bigger setpieces and challenges for their characters. As a result, the movie becomes increasingly harder to swallow as it goes along, because you simply won't believe that ANYONE would go to all the trouble to inflict this particular type of deadly terror on the protagonists. Sure, I admit that I was never bored at any point, but it was hard to care about the characters or the situation because almost everything was quite unbelievable. If you must watch this movie, it's best reserved when you're in a really undemanding mood where you won't think too hard during your viewing.",Escape Room
12,trashgang,the better one,7,19 December 2020,"Two flicks with the same title. One from 2017 and this one from 2019. This is the better one. A mixture of a normal escape room and Saw.It does have an open ending an guess what, 2021 the follow up will come out.Is it worth checking out. Well if you are out for some gore and red stuff, forget it, it's all about suspense. People do die that's for sure but towards the end you will get the feeling that Saw comes in.One to check out for the effects. The upside down room is one to discover and to see for the camera tricks used.So after all not a bad one.

13,deloudelouvain,Good entertainment.,7,11 April 2019,"If you're just looking for easy entertainment then you can't go wrong with Escape Room as there are never dull moments and there is that constant feeling that something bad is going to happen. Maybe it's a bit over the top but that's the style of this kind of movies, and it might be predictable at times but the general idea is working, the audience is entertained. The acting wasn't bad concidering the genre of movie, nothing mindblowing either but good enough to not be annoyed. Some reviewers compare it to Saw, which is partialy true but Saw is just a bit sicker with more gory moments.",Escape Room
14,siderite,Escape and don't watch it,6,26 October 2019,"The movie is not bad in itself, it's just that everything in it is a cliche. If you didn't think escape rooms are dumb before, you will certainly feel this way now. The thrill of the ordinary guy caught in terrifying circumstances fails to make any impact when you don't have any characterization, when you know it's a game, when you get information as you go along, so you can't feel you're part of it and when you know it's a game inside a movie! And that ending...Bottom line: couldn't feel a thing for any of the characters except the obvious final girl. They wouldn't let me. The game was rigged.",Escape Room
15,thesar-2,I Saw The GameCube,8,18 August 2020,"I had a hearty laugh 55 seconds in when one of the opening production company logos was for ""Original Films"" and this is THE THIRD MOVIE CALLED ""ESCAPE ROOM"" in as many years.Actually 2 were made in 2017, only one was released in 2018 and this third, unrelated entry was showed in 2019. Now, so far, I've made it past the 2018 released one and this 2019 ""final"" movie with the title. I actually really liked the 2018 edition. And now I LOVE the 2019 one.It is, in fact ""Original."" This 2019 Escape Room couldn't be further from the 2018 released one. Which is a good thing. Now we can enjoy both.I digress. This movie was fantastic. It's for Saw Movie Lovers. It's for Escape Room fanatics. It's for Strangers Thrust into a Game/Cube and have to work their way out. Only this time: I actually gave a damn about the characters.Yes, I've seen the three Cube movies, the eight Saw films, the Single-Digit Belko Experiment and called The Game a GREAT movie. But, this time, I genuinely cared about each and EVERY character. Well, only one was an asshole, but he still attempted to help other victims 50% of the time.Basically, six strangers receive a boxed invite to win $10,000 for being ""the ONE"" who survives a known unbeatable Escape Room in Chicago. Only, early on, it becomes apparent this...Is.... REAL. Now our stranger victim/main players have to solve riddles, learn about themselves and help each other out to survive this deathtrap series of rooms of which they should be familiar with.I DID care when a character died or did what they could for others. It was SUPER nice to see not the worst in humanity as we normally get in these movies where unwilling victims fight amongst themselves with survival instincts and flat-out murder each other to live. This cast actually tried to be human or moralistic.I loved the sets and world-building, the dialogue/jokes had me rolling, the acting NEVER lagged and aside from them starting on a 3rd floor of a Chicago Highrise, I truly believed in all the peril these people were put in. You want tension, suspense, horror and human redemption, check out 2019's Escape Room. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.And quite frankly, who can say THAT about a January release?***Final thoughts: I try not to do any research on a film I really want to see beforehand. So, it was a nice and pleasant surprise to see a long-time crush of mine was in this: Tyler Labine. BUT, more importantly: Deborah Ann Woll was another one of the cast. I LOVED her as Jessica in True Blood and it took me a little while to get used to her as a Human Role instead of supernatural in the TV series. But at least it was good to see her again, since the series died. Wish I could say the same for Labine...he's NOT as cute as he used to be. Sigh.",Escape Room

17,ThomasDrufke,Clumsy & Fun,6,8 January 2019,"It's the first officially released film of the year, so my expectations are about as low as they could possibly be. January has and probably always will be the dumping ground for movie releases (although September has tried to take those reigns in recent years), but Escape Room manages to be a semi-entertaining if not overtly silly mystery thriller. In many ways, the film is almost too clever for its own good. Constantly proposing new and fascinating ideas amidst a cool action scene, only to be outdone by clumsy dialogue and below average acting. But make no mistake, for an early January release, this was a solid amount of fun.6.0/10",Escape Room

21,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,17 April 2019,"Escape RoomFYI: Escape rooms are not a good activity for anyone who has been held captive before.Fortunately, none of the participants in this horror movie are suffering PTSD yet.An eclectic group (Deborah Ann Woll, Taylor Russell, Jay Ellis) is invited to participant in an escape room challenge for the chance to win $10,000. However, each room that the players enter has a connection to one of their pasts. The guilty party must expose the secret in order to get the combination to the lock. But with teammates dropping fast, those remaining must unmask the gamemaster before time runs out.Piggybacking on the popularity of locked rooms and the torture horror movie craze, this low-budget ensemble does have some intense moments, but the derivative and inconclusiveness ending derails everything that came before it.Besides, the easiest way to breakout of an escape room is to take the teenage attendant hostage.

I've always said that budget doesn't matter provided you don't swing above your weight but here it's helped no end.Both of the previous two were watchable stuff but this right here is very impressive and positively franchise worthy.It tells the story of six people invited to participate in an escape room for a 10,000 dollar prize. All starts innocently enough until things start getting a little too real.Starring the excellent Tyler ""Tucker & Dale"" Labine and Deborah ""True Blood"" Ann Woll I was impressed with the competent cast, the stunning visuals, genuine intellect and originality (Despite all the others of the same ilk recently).By the time the credits rolled my belief that this should be a franchise had strengthened. This, could be something really special.

28,cruise01,Better than expected with fun suspenseful thrills that will keep you on the edge.,8,5 January 2019,"Escape Room (4 out of 5 stars).Escape Room is a twisted and fun thriller film that lacks the originality of the concept since there are films like Saw, The Collector, and The Belko Experiment. But the film does not stop you from being entertained with a thrilling direction that does keep you on the edge of your seat and plays around with the concept of characters going through several escape rooms and puzzle solving. If they fail to solve in time or escape, there are some deadly consequences.The plot follows several characters Zoey (Taylor Russell), Ben (Logan Miller), Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll), Mike (Tyler Labine), Jason (Jay Ellis), and Danny (Nik Dodani) all getting an invitation puzzle box that invites them to an escape room experience. If they get out, they will win 10,000 dollars. Right when they go to the destination and waiting in the first room. That is were the games begin. They will have to use their knowledge and problem solving to get through each room before they fall for the trap. With each room and puzzle solving involving a secret of their past. They figure out there is something bigger going on than just an escape room game.The plot was good. It may not be fresh of an original idea. But it was entertaining to see several strangers trying to figure out the clues and survive. Each character has their own backstory of a tragic past that lead them to this game. Each character all has their own distinct personality on how they try to survive. Zoey is a sweet, intelligent college student. Ben is an alcoholic and a dead beat teenager. Amanda was in the military. Mike is a truck driver. Jason is a financing businessman with a selfish attitude. Danny is the geeky teenager who is obsessed with problem solving. But how are all these characters connected? Or what they have in common? The build up with the plot was good. As they go from one deadly room to another. From a room that is firing up in high temperatures to a frozen lake that is breaking apart to an upside down bar and a white static sound room that may not be for the sensitive audience that can not handle flashy dizzying lights.Taylor Russell was good playing her character that is pushed to her limits as she progressed through the games. Logan Miller, Deborah Ann Woll, Tyler Labine, Jay Ellis, and Nik Dodani were all good with their characters.Director Adam Robitel did well in building the suspense and thrills. As characters are facing danger in every room. The direction did well in making you feel claustrophobic or fear of falling from an upside down room. The opening scene with a character being crushed from a room with walls closing in does set the momentum of the suspenseful direction. The music score Brian Tyler and John Carey also helped creating the tone with each room.I did feel like the twist was a bit far fetched with the last ten minutes of the movie. Without giving away spoilers about the idea of the escape rooms and the ending. Yes, it does leave room for a sequel. I was disappointed and the twist did not leave that surprising shock feeling at all.Overall, Escape Room is a good psychological horror film. The cast was great. The script and plot was good with having several strange characters playing a deadly game. The direction did have suspense and thrills that was entertaining. Twist may have been the weakest link in the movie. But it was still a fun good time watching the movie.",Escape Room
29,Floated2,Start of an interesting thriller franchise,8,21 May 2020,"Having little to no interest when saw the trailers of this film but assuming Escape Room to be somewhat of watered down ""PG13"" version of Saw- marketed towards the teen and younger crowd. Then seeing praise and surprise of a decent film from fans alike.This film is somewhat surprising on a good way as it does what it is intended too. It is entertaining and not boring throughout and provides enough thrills and interest. Solid characters although stereotypical, but we get to know them and do start to root for them.For a B rate thriller type, people seem to have much higher than needed be expectations. The trailers show exactly what type of film to expect. Don't watch the film expecting an amazing complex plot or articulate acting.

30,eddie_baggins,"Embracing its over the top concept, Escape Room is a whole lot of fun",6,11 November 2019,"It may not make an ounce of sense and it at times features some questionable acting and directing choices, but when watched with the right frame of mine, Escape Room is the perfect escapist piece of entertainment that will be a lot of fun for anyone that loves a good puzzle/Saw like thriller.Taking the worlds obsession with escape rooms to a whole new level by adding a life and death spin on the popular past time activity, Adam Robitel's low-budget but well-staged horror thriller is one of those nicely constructed genre entries that never takes itself too seriously and fully embraces it's over the top concept to provide some memorable kills, set-pieces and twisting and turning narrative that seemingly wants to set up future installments.Opening with a hurry as we are thrown into an escape room that doesn't seem like a whole lot of fun, Robitel quickly introduces us to a range of characters that form the basis of our main team of escapees, with Taylor Russell's brainiac student Zoey, Logan Miller's supermarket working slacker Ben and Jay Ellis's snobbish businessman Jason forming the core of our disposable group of humans, who are all nothing more than thinly drawn caricatures and pawns for the films money making concept of a genuine real life escape room where a failure means perma-death.By very early on realizing what it is and what people want from the experience, Escape Room finds a very fun groove as we move from room to room with our collection of players that find themselves under threat from a room of fire, an icy solitude or a disappearing elevator shaft, plus other threats and the film creates a game within itself as we begin to create wagers in our minds about who will escape and who will not.Much like recent horror success Happy Death Day, Escape Room makes a nice space for itself by providing a fun and over the top horror yarn that is more thriller than chiller and while hardcore genre fans may be disappointed by the lack of scares or gore in the film, its inventiveness and creativity will keep you entertained throughout, even if you do wish the people we are playing this game with were a little more likeable and unique, making the stakes of the whole dastardly affair that much more engaging.Final Say -A fun, silly and totally enjoyable romp, Escape Room is not fine dining cinema but its willingness to accept what it is and run with it means another adventure in Adam Robitel's freshly created universe is something to look forward to.3 defibrillators out of 5",Escape Room

36,paul-allaer,Where is all the scary stuff? and where is all the fun?,3,5 January 2019,"""Escape Room"" (2019 release; 100 min.) opens with a bang: a guy seemingly drops from out of the ceiling into a room, whose walls are rapidly closing in on him. Will he manage to escape the room? We then go back to ""Chicago, Three Days Earlier"", as we get to know several people, including Zoey, a shy college student taking a quantum physics class. The professor encourages Zoey to do something outside of her comfort zone over the Thanksgiving break. He then sends her a mysterious black box, which Zoey finally manages to open. It contains an invitation to participate in an escape room contest. Five other people have received the same invitation (we learn much later what the connection between those 6 people is), and they convene in a third floor office waiting room... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Adam Robitel, who just last year brought us ""Insidious: The Last Key"". Here the movie makers have what sounds like a possibly intriguing premise: put a group in a room which seemingly has no way out, but of course there is if you find the right clues. In the film, the group will go through 5 rooms altogether, and each of the escape rooms has a particular theme to it. So far, so good. Alas, that is it for the good stuff. Now the not-so-good: there is no character development to speak of, with Zoey being the one minor exception. As a result, I have zero emotional involvement in any of them (with the exception of Zoey, however minor). Worse, there are no scary moments to speak of, in fact none. As a result, we merely watch what happens on the screen, but not in a scared way at all. Last but certainly not least: where is all the fun? I wasn't having any fun watching this, and it appears neither do any of the 6 lead performers making this movie. I can't help but recall ""Happy Death Day"" of a few years ago (whose sequel was one of the trailers shown in the previews, by the way). which also had an interesting premise (""Groundhog Day"" for scary movies), but which brought it with smarts, with some fun and definitely some scary moments. Too bad ""Escape Room"" couldn't be more like that. I wish I could be more positive about ""Escape Room"", but the truth is I felt very disappointed.""Escape Room"" opened wide this weekend. The Saturday screening where I saw this at in a large theater was attended okay, but just okay (about 25 people). If you are into scary movies, keep your expectations low, and maybe this will work out fine for you. Of course I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Escape Room
37,jtindahouse,Highly original and highly entertaining,8,21 February 2019,"I remember seeing 'Cube' when I was a kid and being fascinated by the concept. 'Escape Room' is basically 'Cube' on heat. What surprised me most was how creative it managed to be (and I expected a creative movie going in). Some of the rooms created in this film were next level, both in their look and function. Moving from room to room kept the pacing at a very fast level as well. Add in highly watchable characters, an original concept and some clever plot twists and you have yourself a very fine film.What excites me about 'Escape Room' is the unlimited potential for sequels. There is an incredible amount you could do with this concept. If they played it right they could have countless sequels and have each one of them feeling equally fresh. While I did like the characters in this one, I don't necessarily see them needing to be the same in the next one either. They could go the 'Final Destination' route and have a different cast each film (with perhaps the odd reoccurring character).There wasn't a lot I didn't like about the film. Perhaps one of the rooms (the ice room) dragged a little too long and the ending, while I appreciated its endeavour, didn't quite deliver the knock-out blow I would have liked to nudge this up to a 9/10. Still though, the large majority of the film is a great viewing experience no doubt about it. If you're on the fence about this film, get out and see it. You'll be glad you did.",Escape Room

It doesn't play by any set rules, and just feels lazy as a result, like they had an idea, and couldn't be bothered figuring out how to make it work.Hard to believe there's a sequel coming.

Six strangers are told they'll win $10,000 if they solve an escape room. You and I would be immediately suspicious, but these guys all need the money and/or are escape room aficionados, so they jump at the chance. But this ain't no ordinary escape room, and the stakes - dun dun DUN - are all too real. And, naturally, the six strangers all share some sort of commonality, and the reason for their selection is, while appropriately malevolent (similar to but in a different tone from the Saw movies), a little too old fashionable for this kind of movie. The escape rooms (plural) are pretty creative, and the tension is appropriately ratcheted up, but some of the characterizations fall flat and are either excessively overbearing or cloyingly sympathetic. If one can get past some of the dumb dialog and ignore the criminally obvious setup for a sequel that'll probably never happen, this might be a half-decent movie. Or maybe it's just a half-baked version of better movies.",Escape Room

Once the game starts, they realize that they are in deadly danger-most of them just thought they would be able to go home, if they failed a test. Each room they escape from just leads into another death trap. Whoever is behind the games knows personal background information-dark secrets-on each contestant. You do discover exactly what is going on and why, by the end of the movie and there is an ending set up for a sequel.

44,alindsay-al,A Poor Generic Horror/Thriller,3,15 July 2021,"I'm going to see Escape Room: Tournament of Champions tonight, so I thought I better watch the first film in the franchise Escape Room and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees six strangers trapped in different escape rooms looking for a way to survive.Main Character
Taylor Russell plays Zoe who is our main character here and she is just fine in the role, for a young actress she has some decent moments but unfortunately her performance falls down because her character is so generic and boring. She is basically this incredibly intelligent girl who has the answer to everything and it makes it a bit annoying at times. There is so little explained about her as a character that it makes it tough to care despite an actress really trying to make you care which is a shame.Supporting Characters
The rest of the cast fall down with this too, the actors are trying their best to give good performances but are let down by poor writing and poor characterisation. I mean Deborah Ann Woll from Daredevil is here and does a decent enough job, the rest of the cast are also okay. But we have the arrogant businessman, the PTSD army vet and the drugged up youth. It was like they just didn't want to bother creating interesting characters because that was too much effort.Story
The story is where the film really falls down. The overall idea of a horror film in an escape room is a pretty decent idea, the issue is that a franchise like Saw exists and this idea has been done before plenty of times. It could have worked, but the characters aren't interesting and there is minimal time spent getting you to care about them in any way with a frustrating cliff-hanger ending that the film did not earn.Script
The script is also bad, the dialogue is cliché and the overall writing for the story is just badly handled. The writing mixed with poor character development is the biggest hinderance for the film.Style
The film actually has some pretty interesting escape rooms that deal with different types of challenges for the group of people to go at, the film is also paced pretty well, I never got bored and think the film was dragging. But I think the issue is that this film is a bit tame and by the end I feel like I have barely learnt anything about the overall plot. I hate to make the comparisons to Saw but the traps in those films are way more inventive and brutal then what we see here.Overall
Overall, Escape Room is a poor film. It doesn't do enough for horror fans to sink their teeth into and it doesn't do anything to convince others to watch so this is one you can skip.",Escape Room
45,CubsandCulture,It is like less a silly Saw film mixed with a more hopeful Cube film,7,3 September 2019,"There is not a lot to do with this premise of a group of people have to escape a series of deadly puzzles that hasn't been done before. The film doesn't really try to, through the ending seems to imply a grandeur scheme is coming. In any case what the film does well is to find a nice sweet spot to be engaging and grounded without getting needlessly complicated with the plotting. The puzzles were simply enough to be believable and clever enough to seem like puzzles. The film does a good job avoiding the Rube Goldbergisque silliness of the (later) Saw films while maintaining a sense of danger and dread.The other issue these films can run into is most of the characters are unrepentant moral monsters in the end. I.e. eventually the group is more dangerous than the puzzles. The film does enough of that stuff to fulfill the genre requirements but by using a spectrum of characters and textual ambiguity the film is nowhere near as sour and misanthropic as these stories can be. It also helps the film really does try to ground the premise in how actual escape rooms work.The characters are pretty archetypal but I liked Ben a lot. He was a detached Gen Z-millennial that is so done with this crap.",Escape Room

To escape from the rooms it requires some sports which includes clues, the fun game soon turns into scare and shock as some of them starts loosing their life.The acting is weirdly bad and it seems that the acting is been done by some amateurs, Taylor Russell and Jay Ellis were the most annoying followed by Nik Dodani and Deborah Ann Woll. The screenplay is irritating and the constant fight among all six of them will make you more irritating, Climax of the movie doesn't excites and as mentioned earlier just gives a glimpse of another sequal in making.With gawky direction and dilettante acting this movie is nothing but a fine example of how to waste your precious 100 minutes.

Back stories from the characters slowly come to surface, There weren't any actors I recognized.It follows six strangers including a student, a slacker and a business man who receive mysterious invitations in the mail to a new immersive escape room in which the last remaining player will receive ten thousand dollars -the prize should have been more to lure people in but whatever. They soon discover the games stakes are deadly. The twist at the end is a bit of a stretch but worth a watch",Escape Room
52,kluseba,Lazy,5,10 January 2019,"Escape rooms have become quite popular over the past few years and it's surprising that a movie about this intriguing concept has only been released this year when this trend is already slowly declining. This film would have been much more successful if it had been released three to five years ago. The concept of the movie is really simple: six strangers get an invitation to an Escape Room game but the challenges quickly turn out being deadly. They must figure out why they have been chosen, try to cooperate as much as they can and survive the trials and tribulations.This movie has exactly one positive element which is though so important that it makes the film bearable on its own: the different rooms are challenging, diversified and intriguing. They include the settings of a frozen lake, an old bar and a twisted laboratory among others. The riddles are diversified and vary from puzzles over music to literature. The fact that parts of these rooms are connected to traumatic events of the past for the characters adds some thrills at the right moments.Everything else about this movie is a catastrophe. Let's analyze it chronologically. The first scene is actually one of the last scenes of the film, revealing who is believed to be the lone survivior, which takes away from the tension the movie could have built up to that point. Up next, we are only introduced to three of the six characters and this already reveals the order in which the characters are going to die. The conclusion is a shameless copy of the Cube franchise. The final scene offers a ridiculous open ending that makes no sense at all but leaves the possibility for a sequel if this movie performs well. As we all know, sequels are often even worse than the original film and since this movie is already quite bad, one doesn't want to imagine how terrible another one could be.Here's my proposal for you: Experience a real Escape Room challenge with some friends. It will be more interactive, peak your curiosity and help you learn more about your friends and yourself. Don't watch this exchangeable movie with its average actors and lazy plot that you will forget about as soon as it's over. This movie stupidly tries to exploit a contemporary phenomenon for its own economic purposes but it fails at so many levels that one almost feels insulted watching parts of it.",Escape Room

and win $10,000.Does coincidence exist? I'm starting to believe it. Coincidentally, I had just seen this movie and a few days later my wife receives a birthday present from her brother. An entrance ticket for an Escape Room. My first reaction was ""Do I really have to go too?"" That was meant as a joke because I don't think we'll experience such situations as in the movie ""Escape room"". I've done two of those escape rooms already (one we've finished successfully) and so I know it's nothing more than doing some old-fashioned puzzling to get out. No ""Saw"" -like conditions like in this film ""Escape Room"". But mind you. There aren't any extremities here as in ""Saw"".They sprout like mushrooms and are good for short-term entertainment. Nothing like being locked up in a room and then trying to get out of it on time, with a group of friends or family. The characters in this film may not be family related, but they all have one secret thing in common. And they all unexpectedly receive a mysterious cube in which an invitation for the ultimate escape room is hidden. And voila, our six participants Zoey (Taylor Russell), Ben (Logan Miller), Jason (Jay Ellis), Mike (Tyler Labine), Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll) and Danny (Nik Dodani) are waiting in a waiting room of a company. They'll be competing with each other so one of them can win the price of $ 10,000.And the winner is the one who can escape as first from the inventively designed rooms. In my eyes, they were all a bunch of losers when they accepted the invitation. How can you be the first to escape from an escape room. Everyone knows that it's played and won as a team. Wasn't there any of these competitors who asked himself or herself that same question? I could understand it from scatterbrain Ben. But I was expecting more from brainiac Zoey, stock exchange guru Jason and ""Escape Room"" expert Danny.Now, it's not as bloody and frightening as ""Saw"". The makers of this film behaved well and made a softer version. If only they had made an effort to increase the tension a little more and the victims' fatal ending a bit more bloody, this certainly could have been a superb movie. The only thing that causes some excitement, is the design of the different rooms that the group of competitors must get through. And preferably unscathed. I found the room in a snow landscape and the pool bar magically designed. Not only the decor was brought to perfection with lots of details. They also wracked their brains about the puzzles that need to be solved. But as I said before, this is also the only thing I was enthusiastic about.Unfortunately, they've chosen to use the final scene as an intro. That way a large part of the tension is taken away already. Even though a small surprise provides an alternative outcome (but to be honest it's also fairly predictable), the end isn't really convincing and satisfying. Admittedly, the final reason why these specific people have been chosen gives the whole a sinister taste. But unfortunately, it fell short in several areas. In fact, the denouement looked really implausible. Who manipulated the electronic scoreboard in the end? And for the umpteenth time, the film ended in such a way that there's another opportunity for a sequel. I'm not looking forward to it. It was entertaining. Sure was. But you also have that when you actually visit an ""Escape Room"". I expected something more from this.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",Escape Room
58,aidanratesmovies,"Entertaining and Intense, but by far flawed",5,28 April 2019,"Escape room has a uniquely fun and suspenseful premise, and it manages to act upon that premise in the best way possible. However, Escape Room forgets how to be a movie rather than just focusing on its main purpose. The acting is by far not great, but even with the lazy written dialogue for the characters, most of the actors try their best with what they have. Some plot points seem rather convenient however, and not all the actors seem to really know what they are doing with their roles. Even worse, at times, the context of each characters story seems rather forced, and in the worst way possible. In the end however, the story makes up with characters to care about and by far an entertaining and intense use of the concept they promised. Hopefully, if there is a sequel, they can make use of a good script as well.

The Employer had one room, practically no gadgets, no puzzles, and yet death was the only exit. I must admit that Escape Room was a far more exciting watch. These escape dramas, where a small group are tortured to find a way out by some sort of psychopath, such as in Saw or Cube, are now a genre all their own, much like teen slasher movies. Usually there's one extremely dangerous personality, and one highly sensitive, whom may or may not be the one we the audience gradual identify with as the good one. Escape Room is better by delivering highly complex characters, and although draws a little on backstories, we're well into full horror before pasts become in any way relevant. Visually Escape Room is something new. Bizarre rooms have appeared in movies before, but this movie is dedicated entirely to them. It's a great idea, and it works. Truly exciting, spellbinding.

She's blond and I know I've seen her somewhere before but I'm too lazy to google for her but if I see her in another film playing a leading role, I'm going to change the channel or walk out of the film and ask for my money back. Life is too short to waste time watching bad acting.",Escape Room
62,rgkarim,Escaping The Normal Slasher/Horror Formula,8,4 January 2019,"The age of horror took a major turn when the Saw series unleashed its gory thrills to the Hollywood industry. Sadly, the very edge and gimmicks it brought grew stale, as sequel after sequel appeared to dilute the quality and originality. Soon carbon copies came in, eventually flooding the market with mediocre films that didn't do much to progress the genre. Still, there are always those hopes that some quality still lurks in the chaotic slew that is this genre. Hi, Robbie K here with his first review of the year on the latest Horror movie entitled:Movie: Escape Room (2019)Director:
Adam Robitel

Stars:
Deborah Ann Woll, Taylor Russell, Tyler LabineLIKES:New Twist
Attention To Detail/Creativity
Good Acting
Character Development
Story
Stuck To Gimmick
Suspenseful Energy
Short Run TimeSUMMARY: These types of films fall victim to stale presentations and lack of originality. As such, the Escape Room approach was a nice twist on this film bringing with it a new creativity and approach that was refreshing. Each of the rooms had extraordinary detail, planned out to feel like the intense game of survival, filled with snares, baits, and clues to spur the threats on. Such design brought with it new arenas to engage your mind and held much more sustenance.
What further advanced the story were the characters, contenders who for once had more dimension than simple, snobbish, cannon fodder that often take center stage. These players held backstories, opportunities to learn, and personalities that evolved with each passing minute. As such, I found myself rooting for the team to succeed instead of rooting for a timely demise to end their flawed personalities. The actors had more room to use their talents to cross the spectrum and do a surprising job expanding upon what was once simple roles.
Tying all of this together those, was an engaging story that managed to combine all the backstories, gimmicks, and flair into an engaging cinematic piece that delivered on its promise, but remained interesting on many levels. Uncovering the mysteries, solving the clues, and keeping the energy flowing through the film with a presentation that was filled with anticipation and excitement. Given that they balanced the gimmick with a story it gets bonus points, even more so keeping it in the short run time leads to even more bonus points.DISLIKES:
Cliché
A few stretches
Wanting More Backstory for some characters
Ruined by TrailersSUMMARY: Sadly, all the planning and details laid out still haven't escaped the cliché and unoriginality that follows these types of films. Escape Room falls into these own sets of traps, but fortunately the spin, ingenuity, and suspense are able to divert the blunt of this area of improvement. One of those that is a bit eye rolling, is that the rooms takes some stretches of the imagination and ignoring reality to get on board. While most of it is acceptable, there are some times I had to turn my brain off extra to get over the unrealistic hurdle.
In addition, there was a little bit of adjusting the story order I would have liked to see, placing all the character stories closer to the beginning where their lives were explained in more detail. Had they done this, I feel some of the parts rushed over for me would have been improved, but this minor detail is nothing compared to my big limitation. That much of the story, twists, and fates have been revealed in the trailers to great detail. If you've got a good memory, and watch the trailer with enough focus, you'll get about 60-75% of the movie revealed. So avoid the trailers enough and you will be okay, but otherwise look forward to the last 25% to really give you the last tidbits.The VERDICT:This genre is what you pay for, but fortunately Escape Room renews the potential for greatness in this type of movie. With a focus on detail, character designs, and story integration this addition to the group was fantastic for me. It's engaging pace and suspenseful energy will offset most of the film's limitations. Given all the visuals and fun I had, the movie is well worth a trip to the theater and certainly one of the better horror movies to show up in a while, at least in terms of thriller/slasher. I certainly enjoyed this film and look forward to this direction for future installments if possible. My scores are:Drama/Horror/Mystery: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0",Escape Room
63,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Escape Room,7,9 January 2019,"Six strangers are promised $10,000 if they can unknowingly win a life and death game. They have to exhaustively find their way out of a Minos Escape Room Facility in downtown Chicago (ah, yet another freaking movie that takes place in yet doesn't echo The Windy City). That's the rub of Escape Room, my latest review. In truth, I found ""Escape"" to be as disturbing or upsetting as any PG-13 endeavor I've ever seen. After viewing it, you might think twice about entering any sterile office building with I guess, one creepy employee and a butt load of surveillance.Released in January yet better than your typical January ""junk"", Escape Room revitalizes the helplessly trapped, twenty-something genre. Bucked with a hint of originality, it has elements of stuff like The Game, The Belko Experiment, any Saw sequel, 1997's Cube, and even The Breakfast Club (go with me on this one). With ""Escape"", director Adam Robitel gives us a nifty little thriller that resembles the aforementioned but in good taste. He piles on the tension, effectively inserts flashbacks, avoids any bloodstained gore, and provides riotous set designs with mounds of verve. Credit also goes to the performance of Taylor Russell as Escape Room's reserved contestant named Zoey. Russell goes from timid physics student to gun-toting badass as the film readily wears on. It's a heck of a transformation.So yeah, ""Escape's"" polar characters walk the fine line between being annoying bickers and nervous humorists. And yes, Escape Room's last act piles on twists, turns, and implausible revelations just for the heck of it (the whole diegesis might have been a hallucination or an experimental fugazi, seriously?). Still, this flick with its fringe booby traps, its inventive shocks, and its remorseless cantering keeps you enthralled for 75% of the running time. Yup, I'm down for joining this ""Escape Club"" (that's a reference to an English pop band from the 80's if you didn't already know). My rating: 3 stars.",Escape Room
64,yoggwork,really have a good quality,6,23 May 2019,"Even if it is a small-production type film, it can really have a good quality, so that a lot of domestic garbage money is even more shameful. The whole room environment design is good, but the riddles are too straight and there is no decryption step, and then the death method is too ordinary and not irritating. The final white-left counterattack is to lower the overall quality.",Escape Room
65,vengeance20,"Has the premise of Saw, but sadly lacks the gore!",7,26 January 2019,"Pretty much sums up this film, which I just seen a preview of tonight.The film starts with 6 young 20 somethings being brought together to take part in a mysterious Escape Room event. Each of them was the soul survivor of an horrific accident in their past lives, but each of these strangers has no idea why they were selected, or whose is behind it the event in the first place. So as you'd know, the group are put into an escape room, & there follows the typical traits of an escape room, find clues & figure out how to escape the room. But this room leads to another & then clues & revelations of their pasts start to unfold as the film goes on.I found the film to be pretty decent. It had the Saw & Belko Experiment themes going on & I can't help but feel the Now You See Me Films have a sort of reference in this mind**** of a film along with Hellraiser also playing a role too. It had a solid ending which leaves a door open for a sequel. (I hope!)But my complaints of the film were that it wasn't gory, in fact, it was almost bloodless. Reason for my complaint on that was the kind of promise that this was going to be like Saw. Now although I know full well this was a 15+, I still feel the gore could've been kicked up to a near Saw standard. I also felt the deaths were pretty crap & unimaginative, I mean, this film had the potential to make the death sequences unique given how unique the sets & rooms were in this film.The film was pretty much a dulled down version of what Saw is pretty much. It's solid, unique & entertaining, but could've been gorier & more fast paced, the film dragged a bit to be honest. I also felt the film went off the rails a bit & could've been more grounded.But overall it was a pretty decent film. It had both good & bad points to it, but it was unique in its own right. Though it could've been gorier, with the deaths being better & more grounded topped with a fast paced treatment.7/10",Escape Room
66,elliotjeory,Better than expected,7,1 January 2021,This film is well made and produced and has some great suspenseful scenes.

67,fntstcplnt,Escape Room (2019),3,23 July 2019,"Directed by Adam Robitel. Starring Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Jay Ellis, Tyler Labine, Deborah Ann Woll, Nik Dodani. (PG-13)Six strangers participate in a game involving a series of escape rooms that prove to be complex, deadly, and (surprise, surprise) a strain on credibility well past the breaking point. Think (neutered) ""Saw"" meets ""Cube,"" and then lower expectations a bit because this film can't even hit those modest heights. Slick, competently-made thriller has a few cleverly designed scenarios, but suffers from inconsistent logic and little meaning, plus it's too generic and tame to appeal to those just looking for some bloody mayhem. The cast is okay but the characters mostly unlikable; the fatal traps can't spring fast enough on some of them. Ends with a set-up for a sequel that hopefully will never come, though judging by the low cost to churn out a product like this, is probably inevitable.31/100",Escape Room
68,arungeorge13,"A 'largely forgettable, yet okay while it lasts' thriller! [+50%]",5,21 April 2020,"The concept is completely unoriginal and the characters are as 'stock' as they can get. Yet, the puzzles somewhat intrigue and the fact that it's a race against time makes it fairly exciting (though repetitive). The upside-down pub was the best (and most inventive) of the lot. The climax is again, a total downer. At a crisp run-time of 95 minutes, the film doesn't let you think too much because it's custom-made for twists and last-second flourishes. Performances are serviceable, but it did look like the cast was 'trying hard'. As was the case with the latter Saw flicks (a little too much déjà vu), the dialogues are mostly banal. Watch it purely as a guilty pleasure!",Escape Room
69,santhosh-10290,Escape Room,10,21 June 2019,Excellent Movie. Everybody acted very well in the movie. The movie was so interesting with many twists and turns. The movie had no unwanted scenes or characters. The movie was not at all boring. VFX and BGM in the movie were excellent. The movie was so thrilling. Excellent Movie.,Escape Room
70,m-47826,Decent PG 13 horror.,6,9 November 2019,"I'm glad we're back to the purely entertaining movies, without the so called depth and thoughtfulness. No gore either, just thrills, and it worked. And the smart aspect was effective, and actually intelligent. In a « geeky » kind of way. However the whole point was hard to grasp for me. Even for this amount of money, I would've never joined the « game ». It's like answering those emails telling you you won something, or inherited some stranger's wealth. Fishy to say the least. But I'm sure people like that exist, hence the characters in the movie. Who were harmless stereotypes, played by good actors. The diversity didn't bother me either, because it was obvious some profiles needed to be embodied by certain ethnicities. So the whole thing was made with good intentions, not just to convey a « message ». Some of the traps and deaths may have been handled a little better, but what can you do. The twists could've been worked better too. The ending was a little too « cartoonish », with the vilain standing in the shadow, talking like a Nickelodeon cartoon character. But I wouldn't mind sequels from this, that may have been a rip off all survival/torture horrors, but managed to remain entertaining and efficient. Plus I hated said movies, due to the over the top violence/gore and convoluted (even to writers) storylines. So why not redeem the genre, with a lighter new franchise?",Escape Room
71,martimusross,"Don't Bother, Mediocre at Best",3,26 January 2019,"The plot for this movie seems to have been done to death with slight variation over the last couple of years. Surely someone can come up with something new.The movie was far to frenetic, the music intrusive, the acting was mostly melodramatic at best and hammy at worst.

72,gianmarcoronconi,High level of tension,7,25 July 2021,"Very cute movie and with high levels of tension in various places where an innocent game turns into a trap in a death trap driven by very powerful men. I think the ending is a bit forced but all in all it makes sense. The acting is very good and the special effects are discreet. As a negative point, however, there is the fact that the film makes you live the characters in a very detached way so do not feel too sorry when they die and this dampens the tension a bit.",Escape Room
73,muamba_eats_toast,Much better than expected,8,11 February 2019,Ultimately the film is largely just a number of set pieces however they are executed to great effect and keep you gripped to the edge of your seat. The storyline isn't the most complex or perfect but the actors do a good enough job making you care about their plight with limited resources. In summary a very enjoyable watch despite its flaws there are a lot worse actions out there!,Escape Room
74,gedikreverdi,The luckiest sole-survivor of all,7,13 July 2021,"Zoey was the most lovely character of all along with Ben the grocery guy that caused his friends die on a joyride. Jason was the most annoying of all and he died when Ben managed to inject the one shot antidote to himself in the room where they were under the effect of a chemical and saw everything distorted. Ben then ended up in the library room which is the opening scene as well. I thought he died but he was in the fireplace and avoided being crushed between the walls. The best room was the upside down bar where the woman soldier died falling down in the elevator shaft. The scorching and the chilling rooms were cool too. Zoey saved Ben from getting killed by the guy when he was thought to be the sole survivor but zoey destroyed the cameras in the poison room where there were hospital beds of each of them when they became the sole survivors. Zoey found another possible escape room place and she wanted to fly to NYC with Ben to help the new victims, but the company was preparing a crashing airplane simulation for them already. I enjoyed it a great deal and will definitely watch the sequel.",Escape Room
75,saptesh786,Game or Escape Room?,5,16 April 2019,"We suppose that the escape rooms are only physical that they are so far, but in this movie such rooms went into the game universe framework. So we can't understand what are we watching a escape room or a game? Such thing takes us in a big confusion zone i.e. what is actual and what is imagination of game? Some contestants had already died, then how they entered into escape room again and died again? Fake images of them? No answer or explanations found here. First at all escape room is going like a oven, then a cold icy area, then all rooms are reverse from bottom to at top and further situation going on endless. It seems that the only aim of escape room is to kill the participants anyhow, no matter of prize money! End is also unrealistic. How game designer know that the last survival are planning to board a plane to reach their headquarters? Here are many questions are unanswered. This movie only keeps you busy in erratic situation and use mind to survive yourself. No logic no explanation required here. Only watch with leaving brain at your home. Then you definitely enjoy this just stupid like movie. You must watch this if you are ready to watch without brain and none of question will be asked till the end. Then go it is for you. Actors and actresses are horrible, that not perfect as role demand. Then again I said leave acting aside only watch unstoppable crazy killing brain less drama. High ratings are wrong.",Escape Room
76,thekarmicnomad,Good value horror,8,30 April 2019,"A group of seemingly unrelated people win a competition to play an escape room.
Obviously the game soon turns into a desperate struggle for survival.This is a great little horror movie with a touch of sleuthing thrown in.
The traps are scary and unpleasant but without the gore and brutality of say Saw.
The characters are less stereotyped than normal horror but you can still pick out the jock, greedy banker, over achiever, nerd etc.The affects stand up ok but be prepared to squint at the places where the CGI budget ran thin.There is nothing amazing about this film but it does what it sets out to do - for which I applaud it.
It doesn't try to be as dark or stylised as ""The Cube"", this is happier being lighter and more accessible.I feel it went a bit too far at the end and wasn't really sold on the direction the post film was taking.This won't blow your mind but you will have an entertaining ninety minutes.",Escape Room
77,Fernando-Rodrigues,Entertaining but weak,5,15 September 2020,"Had some fun with this one! it's creative, but it has a lack of innovation-i mean, this amazing concept was just a game for a filthy rich white b**hes corporation?-
Also.. the ending is really abrupt and easy -Zoey shoots the ""mastermind"" behind everything and runs away with Ben. The End!.. 6 months later.. ???-
There could've been less CGI FX too..",Escape Room

79,educallejero,"Like Jigsaw, but produced by Disney and FOR ALL THE FAMILY!",1,16 February 2019,"I absolutely despised this.They SPOIL THE MOVIE ON THE FIRST SCENE (amazing first scene, by the way).WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?Another thing: Usually, the characters trapped are a bit more complex than these guys. They usually start as archetypes: the egotistical douche; the innocent teen; the maternal/paternal figure; the fat/dumb guy; the hot chick. But when we get to know them, we realize that everybody has done bad things, and even the bad guys usually have good qualities.Whatever, that's what is usually done. Not this movie. This movie is nothing. The archetypes are only archetypes, backstory or not. The ""who's doing this"" has been done a gazillion times before, and probably every single time, better than here.And one thing is to be predictable, a lot of movies are in some way or another. Another thing is to be predicable, and play it like they are being new and different while also giving CLEAR EVIDENCE OF WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, with the already named FIRST FREAKING SCENE!Whatever. This is atrocious. Also, about that Disney thing. You have traps. You don't need to go to the extreme Jigsaw graphic violence. No need for that. But you also can't just be PG-7.They stole my money except for the first scene, and a great ""Room"" sequence. Not enough.",Escape Room
80,rockman182,Escape Room (2018),7,11 January 2019,"Now that its a new year, its time for a new year in movies. January is often known as the month where bad movies are released. Escape Room sort of looked like it could fall into that category, but I had interest in this. This was particularly because I have done an escape room a few times (although I've never escaped). Having seen this film, I wish for everyone to ignore what critics say this was actually a solidly entertaining time. About the best possible scenario for a first week of January film.The film is about six different people who are invited to take part in an escape room, one that is billed as the best and toughest one out there. Soon the participants realize that their task isn't just a game and that its a game of survival with death being the consequence. They also soon realize that their selection to participate isn't as random as they initially anticipated. The film is directed by Adam Robitel, the same person responsible for Insidious: The Last Key, which I hated.The rooms and challenges are for the most part clever. Sure, some of the solving of the clues are fast and improbable but suspend that belief and enjoy. Its a really fun time especially for a film that operates with a PG-13 rating. Who would have thought that a film based on a popular social game could actually be really good? It has all the elements of what you would expect from a mystery-thriller so its a good time in the cinemas and a good start to 2019.The film does get messy towards the end, of course you can't really expect this thing to be perfect and without any faults. Also, I really disliked the way the film shamelessly tries to set up for a sequel when it would be better as a one and done, especially since it exceeded expectations. Overall, go see it and judge it for yourself because I feel like this is a picture that will get criticism before people attempt to experience it for themselves.7/10",Escape Room

82,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A Hunger Games knockoff that focuses on elaborate deathtraps.,5,29 June 2021,"For all the Young Adult clones that The Hunger Games (2012) spawned in Hollywood, it's interesting to see something that takes the elaborate death traps present in that series and applies them to the horror genre. While I'm sure the Saw series likely did this kind of thing already, I haven't seen any of those films to know (too bloody for my tastes). This is where Escape Room (2019) takes an interesting premise and makes it feel like a generic Hunger Games knock-off while remaining a PG-13 horror film.At first glance, Escape Room is a smart thriller that forces its ""players"" to solve these rooms and eventually escape alive. Some of these set pieces are quite well done, including an oven and an upside-down bar. The reason these people were trapped in a series of escape rooms was also somewhat interesting, even if it wasn't explained very well. However, as is the case with most horror films, the problem is that none of these characters stick around long enough to give a lasting impression. This becomes apparent early on, which didn't give me an impetus to invest in any characters.Ultimately, Escape Room suffers from some fairly glaring structural flaws. Not only is there a fakeout from the get-go, but the ending is left so incomplete that I can't even comprehend what was accomplished or what the escape room designers had planned to do. Now that I learn there's an Escape Room sequel that is very much like Catching Fire (2013), I can't help but draw more parallels to the Hunger Games series. Overall, the premise didn't feel like it was properly explored, or at least it was explored in too many iterations to whittle down the characters to a manageable level.A Hunger Games knockoff that focuses on elaborate deathtraps, I give Escape Room 2.5 stars out of 5.",Escape Room
83,RforFilm,"Escape Room in so uncaring about it's characters, that I found this puzzle thriller dull and uninspired",4,7 January 2019,"If there's one rule that Hollywood likes to follow, it's that if something is hip and current, then it's bound to get a horror movie. In today's case, its about escape rooms. I haven't done an escape room, even through I like the concept; your with a group, locked in a room (or rooms in some cases) and you need to solves riddles, clues, and puzzles in order to get out before the time runs out. Not only does it almost make a real life video game, but it's a genius way to play up suspense where there is none.The only way one could get genuinely frightened is if the people running the rooms were good enough actors. Escape rooms are another way of illusion, and the trick will only work if they can suspend disbelief that their only playing a game. It's the same idea with video games; even if your rescuing a princess from Super Mario Bros., your really only playing programing on a computer. So the idea of taking an escape room and making it a life or death situation isn't a bad idea. So let's see if Escape Room can develop potential like a cross of The Game and Saw.In Chicago; we focus on several individuals who all receive puzzle boxes. We have college student Zoey (played by Taylor Russell), a slacker Ben (played by Logan Miller), and a successful business trader Jason (played by Jason Walker). They all solve it and receive invitations to a nearby escape room where it's also revealed that if they solve it, they'll receive $10,000. They arrive, along with former solider Amanda (played by Deborah Ann Woll), former miner Mike (Played by Tyler Labine) and escape room expert Danny (played by Nik Dodani). They all head for a waiting area for the game to start...or so they think.When one tries to leave, only for the handle to come off with a set of numbers appearing, they realize that the game has already started. Things become dangerous when the room starts to heat up like an oven. When they manage to get out, they find the next room and several others to be just as perilous. In fact, they see some of their fellow players die. The race is on to see if they can solve the clues, find out who is behind this, and why they were chosen to partake in a most dangerous game.I've said before that I think Escape Room could potentially be a good idea and I even like the angle their taking here. The problem is that the movie is dull and uninspired. Escape Room is another throwaway January release that might play better on streaming platforms, but has little reason for a theatrical release. The first problem is the characters. None of them are memorable or likable enough for care about whether they meet their death solving a puzzle or not. It's hard to tell if they needed better actors or a better script, but I'm betting on the latter, as it has to do with my other problem.The plot is fine, with the goal of simply getting out. It's the overall setup that really fails, and it's worse as I see what they were trying to do. The rooms are supposed to be themed out of a traumatizing past that each character went through. But it only touches upon their past personalities without much rhyme or reason. A character went through a drunk driving history; so let them solves a riddle and their magically cured. One man killed another in his past; so he'll take a drug and confront it. You can tell the script was rushed in favor of focusing on the thrills.I'll give this four escape room passes out of ten. I give it some credit for it's room design and idea in general. But it's too half-assed and non caring on it's characters for me to recommend. At best, if your looking for some thrills within a puzzle room, you'll get some. But for most, I'd say skip this escape room and go to a spa instead.",Escape Room

93,SoumikBanerjee25,A great thriller overall; obstructed by a weaker ending!,8,11 October 2020,"As a Concept, ""Escape Room"" doesn't yield anything new per se; but it bedazzles in its Execution! A competent thriller that is appealing, spirited & wholly entertaining!
All at the same time!I always look for captivating thrillers.
In this booming list of films; sometimes it gets difficult to find any. Luckily I bumped into 'Escape Room'.
The intellection albeit pretty similar to what SaW & Cube conferred way back at 2000's; what I absolutely admire is its approach for unfolding the same substance in disparate manner.
Puzzles are well structured, the visuals complimenting the same. Rendering distinctive ambience & tonalities with the help of versatile color palettes; the cinematography deserves a bucket load of praise.Story sets off on a breathless note and continues in similar fashion until it reaches its conclusion. Stakes being always high, it rarely loosen up on its steam. And that's truly commendable. The characters might have been deprived of germane backstories to support their individual personalities but on a relevance scale they did work absolutely fine.Performances are quite ordinary; but a sparkling chemistry shared between this group is something to take a note of.
I can't elaborate on the exact reason, but They all coagulated so well together.
Perhaps a great selection in casting paid off. The Soundscore had a rather contemporary influence; could be annoying to few. Personally I didn't mind much as I was too invested with the story and its persuasive progression.
My only indisposition is about the climax. Probably the solitary reason I didn't give it a higher rating! Gaping at how remarkably things were going up until the finale; my expectency had already gone up. Guess what? it let me down. Even though I distaste about how it ended; I understand their credulous intensions of setting themselves up for a probable sequel.And if that ever comes up; count me in!",Escape Room

96,CANpatbuck3664,Escape Room Stretches its Interesting Premise Into a Solid Horror/Thriller,7,18 January 2019,"Escape Room is another feature that is trying to start a franchise by keeping the budget down, so it doesn't have to gross a ton to break the bank (or to get the approval for the sequel). Normally, this might be considered a negative, but I think the creative team did an excellent job with the set design and the visual work for the traps. Each of them is frightening or pushes the envelope and the work done on them was good enough that I wasn't constantly questioning the logistics or how certain facets of the traps were plausible or implausible. They look great for a movie with a smaller budget and it was a pleasant surprise.The escape rooms not only looked great, but I also really enjoyed the design of the traps and how the puzzle pieces fit together on how to solve them. It showed some imagination from the screenwriter, director and puzzle designer and the unpredictability sold the danger in each environment. The scarier elements of each room really show off how much potential this premise has (if you can forgive the fact it has similarities to Saw and Cabin in the Woods). Some levels in the game are stronger than others (my least favourite was the ice room) but I also liked how the solutions to the problems incorporated teamwork and outside the box thinking. Again, there's a surprising amount of inspired work in Escape Room and I appreciated that effort instead of just phoning it in.While there's some interesting elements to the problems and environments our characters face, I wish the same detail had been applied to the script. The main group (comprised of 6-7 people) are all distinctive but they can't escape cliché when it comes to their personalities. We have the nerd, the pretty boy jerk, the social outcast etc. and I had hoped they would transcend such simple descriptions. As we find out more about them, you can understand how they're all bitter and why they don't want to trust each other but I think they could have worked a little harder on creating more unique characters. This is made worse by the dialogue being a little stilted. Almost all the jokes in this fall flat and it makes it harder to bond and root for our heroes (or villains depending on which character you're talking about).Escape Room follows in the foot steps of other horror franchises like Saw and Final Destination in its premise, the plot progression and ultimately the actors and actresses they cast. I've already mentioned that Escape Room looks great on a modest budget, but it also follows the proud tradition of hiring so-so actors to fill out the cast. I thought there was 1 clear standout performance and it came from Deborah Ann Woll as Amanda Harper. The participants/players in Escape Room are neither pure victims or virtuous heroes but Deborah shone through and brought the most emotion to her arc as Amanda. I kept hoping she was going to get more screen time and she did the best she could with what could have been a very forgettable character. Tyler Labine was the next best, he's a good character actor and while they desperately needed to punch up his dialogue, he still managed to get a couple of genuine laughs out of me and he had a few effective dramatic moments. I think the rest of the main cast (Taylor Russell, Logan Miller, Jay Ellis and Nik Dodani) were okay but they played a little too far into type. For example, Taylor is a little too reserved, Jay is too mean without any provocation and Nik Dodani is forced to keep playing the same note in his acting repertoire. They aren't helped by the dialogue and character development, but they all get the job done.Escape Room benefits mostly from a great premise and low expectations. My best friend recommended this to me, and his recommendation carries weight. That's what convinced me to go see it. The puzzle design, the interesting set pieces and the overall look of the movie carry it past some of the more implausible moments and while the acting is a mixed bag, the cast does what they can while the material and dialogue try to drag them down. The ending features a nice twist, but it risks pushing the movie into some goofy territory to setup a sequel. I would love to see a sequel to Escape Room, it would give them a chance to build off this debut feature and further shape the idea into a really good movie (e.g. how they took the original Purge movie and drastically expanded on the idea in the sequels). I would give Escape Room a 7.5/10 for delivering a better than expected horror thriller but I can't go all the way to 8/10 because of some of the bigger problems. I'll round down to a 7/10. Its worth checking out but if you can't catch it in the theatre, I think you could stream it at home and have a good time.",Escape Room

it's a rollercoster ride; you just buckle you seat belt and enjoy the show. What worked than any other movies with the same theme is giving background story, show empathy for the characters and making them work as a team for the most part. It's exciting, thrilling and maybe a bit predictable at parts but the movie as a whole worked.What did not work:
anti climatic; maybe the conclusion of the puzzle could have been stronger, with convincing scenes leading to the end. Also, the ending of the movie shows there is a sequel coming up but I did not get why they are filming an action sequence when the real event is meant to destroy the whole plane in real.Final verdict: it's an exciting movie",Escape Room

The story is simple and unoriginal, but the setting starts off strong with some great puzzle rooms and tension. However, as the film becomes formulaic, it loses this edge and has to rely on the settings and passable special effects to keep momentum. The characters are good and well rounded, each with their distinct personalities and back stories, but the mystery behind the game is very disappointing, and the ending is poor and goes on for far too long.",Escape Room

The first is the very first scene, I won't give spoilers but it does the classic ""shows one of the final scenes of the film first"", all this did was eliminate a lot of the surprise and tension as you know full well what the outcome of the characters will be. The second is that throughout the film, more so the 2nd half of it, you're expecting some huge twist to the plot and it just doesn't arrive, so the ending is just underwhelming. It sets for a sequel as well which I find pointless.The film does have good parts and the plot does contain a couple of interesting points which give this ""saw"" plot a bit of depth. The character depth is quite good as well I thought considering it's hard to portray that in such a linear plot. Overall though I think it's just a simple thriller/horror that you can sit back and relax whilst watching. It's not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination and contrary to what I said in the first paragraph I did enjoy my time watching this, so I'll give it a 6.5/10.",Escape Room

105,baileycrawly,Entertaining,7,10 January 2021,"Nobody really puts on a horror movie with the expectation that they're going to see the latest and greatest in cinematic achievements, and this movie is no different. Nobody is putting this movie on expecting Kubrickian levels of detail and storytelling. It's just a fun little thriller and, when you view it through that lens, it's a really successful movie.
The escape rooms are all pretty well done, and the way the characters (though bland and recycled hundreds if not thousands of times in hundreds if not thousands of other movies) played off each other really well. Despite being generic, there was just enough of a charm to them that, when you watch the scenario play out, you can still feel for them. When one of them does something stupid that affects another one (spoilers redacted, of course), you can feel their remorse for the situation. When the time comes for the size of the group to begin diminishing, the characters were done well enough that you're almost sad to see them go, as each subtraction changes the dynamic of the remaining members to a certain degree.
It was a very tense film and, although it took a little bit too long to get going and let me down a little bit with the ending, it was still a really solid and enjoyable film. Given the length of the film, the amount of material they covered and the fact that they needed to end with SOMETHING, I'd say they did pretty good.",Escape Room

109,TwistedContent,High Entertainment Value Above All Else,6,14 January 2019,"Decided to buy a ticket and see ""Escape Room"" on the big screen - got what I wanted plus a little disappointment.It was about time somebody made a movie on the yet little explored theme of escape rooms - a business that's boomin all around the world. How is it? Well, fun! Mostly. I can honestly say that, for its 9 million dollars budget, ""Escape Room"" is a very good looking and sounding adventure, I was not able to detect on-the-nose cheapness anywhere. The good looks, accompanied by dynamic pacing, very decent acting and, (half)decent characters makes up for a nice entertainment that keeps your eyes and mind focused on the screen for 90 straight minutes. I think it's safe to say that this is a very blockbuster-ish flick, it gives what it promises, but nothing much more, my point is - I was entertained, but not amazed. So why the 6/10? What really bummed me out was the story, it was intriguing and promising up until the last 10-15 minutes or so, where the plot started getting kinda wobbly and gave me the impression that the writers weren't exactly sure on how to end this. The ending simply felt dragged-out. Also, it seems that Hollywood nowadays just can't make a standalone movie, apparently almost everything has to be set up for a sequel. One more thing - some gore and a tasty R-rating would've definitely made the good stuff even better. But that's also Hollywood for you - they just love putting the ""pg-13"" stamp everywhere.Seeing the overall rating (6.4 as for 14th of January) and the metascore, I consider it quite accurate. An highly entertaining thriller that seemed to have more unused potential. My rating: 6/10.",Escape Room

Still, for a January release, you expect the worst but it actually was pretty good.Many of the leads were unlikable, but that's to be expected with budget movies like this. Also, it's written like a teen movie, where people are losers one day, white collar successes the next, which is ridiculous, but that's Hollywood.

114,WalkdenEntertainment,This is One Escape Room some may Enjoy...,5,24 March 2019,"Six strangers each accept the delivery of an unusual black box. Inside the puzzling black box they find an exclusive invitation to be part of an ""Escape Room"" but... an Escape Room like they have never seen before. There is also a prize of $10,000 to the winner who can escape and solve the riddles. If you have ever done an Escape Room (and personally I have), you can instantly relate to this film, but this time it is very different than what one may expect. Even if you haven't done a normal Escape Room, not to worry, our film does explain how they normally work.One aspect I personally loved about this film is the plot and concept. On paper, the idea alone is rather creative and my journey to see this in a cinema was simply seeking something different (or something with Finesse!). When viewing the movie trailer, it reminded me other films that I had seen previously seen (such as the Saw franchise) but looked as though it had something new to offer. Escape Room does in fact deliver plenty of creativity with a few random surprises around each corner. As our characters try to continue forward and escape, they soon discover this game is a matter of life and death. Despite this, the first scene alone does giveaway too much, but I was also thankful that our film got going right away and doesn't waste time getting to the main elements of the film.Our characters, on the other hand, are a mixture of young and mature adults which I feel cinema audiences will have no desire to cheer on or support. There are many moments where the characters scripting and dialogue was nothing new and I found it to be rather disappointing and cheesy. Even during a life risking moment, we still have our characters making classic one liners for attempted humour. It's moments like these that take away any tension the film was intending to deliver. Also, if a character dies, it sadly doesn't carry much care factor. If anything, due to wise cracking jokes or general cheesy dialogue it makes the situation more predictable instead of delivering any real surprises, unlike the creativity that is seen in the Escape Room itself.For those who are not a fan of blood and gore, you're in luck. This film contains very little to no gore, making this film able to reach a wider audiences (such as younger teenagers). Despite the characters, some fun can be had. I personally enjoyed seeing each of the rooms as our leads advanced and I give full credit to the film's set designers for being totally creative here. But elements of the story and character did struggle, including the film's ending which I found to be incredibly messy, as if the director had ending up just choosing an ending that had the possible lure of making this film the start of a new franchise. Given the ticket sales for this film so far, I'd say it wouldn't surprise me if we do to see another instalment in the near future....Overall, Escape Room is a fantasic idea for a film and I feel many will have an attraction and curiosity to see this. While the concept and look of the Escape Room itself is fun and awesome to see, our key characters sadly don't deliver the same pleasure or enjoyment. The film's ending felt disappointing and somewhat mucky as if the main goal from the director was to turn this film into a new franchise rather than delivering a more rewarding ending to this story.5.1/10

Who knows how to escape can make a lot of money.Once the game starts, participants learn that escape is going to be more difficult than expected. The different escape rooms from which they have to escape are also so dangerous that they really have to work together and use their minds to survive.A few years back there was also an Escape Room film and it did not mean much. This new Escape Room film is better than the Escape Room movie of 2017, but also does not mean much anymore. The traps and riddles are better conceived and visualized, but are eventually solved too easily by the characters, so that you as a viewer do not really feel the excitement of the film. As a viewer you can try to solve the riddles while watching, which makes the film more fun, but when the riddles are made too big and too difficult in the film, this fun aspect of the film falls away. Just like the previous Escape Room film, the film also appears as a lesser Saw movie. Compared to the Saw films, the Escape Room movies are less creative and cheaper.The film also has an exaggerated end where they try to make everything bigger and more exciting in the hope that eventually a sequel and eventually a new series of films to start, but because of the unclear end the chance that this will happen is very small.Another problem of the film are the characters, because most characters are false egoists, who ridicule each other rather than really help each other in solving the riddles to escape from the escape rooms. Due to the lesser behavior of the characters, you as viewer also give little to them and you are less interested in whether or not they know how to escape from the escape rooms.That way the acting is not that special either. The cast therefore consists of more unknown actors or actors, who have played more in TV series.

The more elaborate the rich person's scheme, the less interested I find it. So, this movie definitely was in for an uphill battle with me.

It doesn't work and it's been done to death to the point that now it only spoils part of your movie. Thank you. After this small rant let's talk about the movie. Escape Room borrows many of its concepts from other movies, but that's not necessarily a bad thing because there aren't that many high concept movies like this, and, for me, they usually work. It is an intriguing idea and makes for an entertaining ride, with some good escape room concepts and many suspenseful moments, which never make the movie boring. The characters are a bit flat and the acting isn't Oscar worthy, but that's not very important here. Another odd choice, following the horrendous spoiler opening, is the decision of only giving background on three of the characters. I would've much preferred if they had started the movie with them already in the escape room or, if you need to pad your runtime, at least give background on all of the characters or otherwise you can more or less guess who's dying first. Which brings us to the elephant in the room which is the ending (light spoilers ahead). The problem with these kind of movies is that it's very hard for the writers to come up with a satisfying ending, you either explain everything and leave many viewers disappointed because you can't deliver on the intriguing concept or you don't explain anything, leaving it to the viewer's imagination with many people complaining that it's an easy cop out. It's a bit damned if you do and damned if you don't, what I call the J.J. Abrams conundrum. This one tries the third route with a totally over the top and unbelievable ending, which is so insane that they hope people won't even stop to think how absurd everything was, while at the same time setting up a sequel, again a sin most people don't like.

A great film with an interesting premise and some great twists and suspenseful moments along the way this is a blast to watch from start to finish and I had alot of fun with this movie.The concept of the movie is really well handled and tells the story of Six strangers who find themselves in a maze of deadly mystery rooms and must use their wits to survive.The characters for the most part are great and I like the dynamic with them all and how they learn to work as a team to survive the rooms its an interesting dynamic and plays out really well for the story and adds to the suspence of the Escape Rooms.The rooms are great and each one is different which always keeps the movie interesting and feeling new with each scene and it really keeps your attention throughout. We also have the interesting mystery throughout the movie of who is behind the deadly maze rooms and why have these people been chosen.The twists are great in the movie and keep the story interesting once again.I especially like the reason as to why they have been chosen for the rooms it's because they are sole survivors of disasters in there lifes and that is the theme the company was going with for these Rooms. It was a great twist that added alot to the characters.My only issues are there are some unbelievable moments and the way they escape the rooms can sometimes be over the top you really need to expand your disbelief and that brings the rating of the film down for me I thing it could of benefitted a little from being more grounded.Also the Jason character was really annoying at times and it took me out of the movie.Verdict 8.5/ 10 a great movie that I really enjoyed alot.Had an interesting premise and for the most part was handled well with great suspenseful moments.Could of benefitted from being more grounded and you need to expand your disbelief sometimes but this a great film that keeps you interested all the way through.,Escape Room
128,jp281995,Thrilling,8,18 August 2019,"Escape Room is one of the most suspenseful films I've seen.Now, escape rooms are popular means for enjoyment. In this movie, the escape rooms become deadly and the characters must use their wit to survive.The film did not fail on the suspense/thrill aspect. The characterization is great, and the acting is nicely done for a horror movie like this. Most of the characters are someone you'll care for and root for.The movie is fantastic until climax.

132,RhapsodyReviews,Not the Worst Thing I've Seen..,4,27 October 2019,"Review:
'Escape Room' is a psychological-horror film directed by Adam Robitel.
I wasn't expecting much going into this movie. One because it came out in early January which a lot of unwatchable movies come out in, and it seemed like a knockoff of the 'Saw' films. It was better than I expected, but it's still not one I will watch again.
The film follows a group of people Zoey (Taylor Russell), a physics student; Jason (Jay Ellis), a wealthy day trader; Ben (Logan Miller), a stockboy; Mike (Tyler Labine), a truck driver; Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll), an Iraq War veteran; and Danny (Nik Dodani), an escape room enthusiast. who are sent to navigate a series of escape rooms, only to discover that their fates are tied to whether or not they can solve the puzzles in time.
When it comes to acting, I always like to give credit when credit is due. In this movie there was only one person that stood out amongst the rest, Deborah Ann Woll. She delivers a heartfelt performance as a veteran with some major scar, both physical and psychological. She is always sadly the only character I cared about in this movie. Nobody else delivered to what they should or probably could have with their character, which are also just written really poor.
The movie starts off at a weak point with trying to introduce us to some of the 'main' characters before we get into the rooms. They only show us three of the six and when we get to the actual escape room scenario, we don't even truly understand who these people are. Another negative is that this movie has horrible dialogue for their character to say. Nobody felt real and just felt like a bunch of actors portraying character instead of watching a story unfold on the screen. When we get into the rooms where they have to escape the movie got some footing. It had cleaver rooms, that were executed smartly and built with care. Unfortunately, the movie goes right back to square one with the final act, which to me felt lazy and cliché.
Overall, this movie never seemed to know what it truly wants to be. With bad dialogue and a bad ending, it makes for a anger inducing movie. However, if you want to watch a movie where you see who is going to die and how, and who might live than this would be a good watch for you.

136,Mivas_Greece,A reference movie and a gold standard for the concept of deadly escape rooms! Suspense and twists in the entire movie!,7,29 September 2021,"Thriller / escape movie. Although many movies of this kind have been released with similar content, this one is definitely one of the best. Escape rooms well, but not just a simple game, rather a struggle for survival against time. Unsuspecting ""players"" must discover the puzzles of each room against time and before they get killed from its deadly traps. Unknown to each other players should cooperate fully, stay as cool as possible but most importantly, hurry because otherwise everyone will die. The movie has really clever puzzles, plenty of suspense from start to finish and twists. In addition to the excellent direction and convincing acting, another positive thing is the fact that it deepens in each character of the film, so that the viewers can better correlate with the players and their struggle for survival. In the end it leaves room for an equally good sequel. It is definitely recommended and it is watched again and again with same interest! A reference film in this concept!",Escape Room
137,Fields201,See It Stoned,7,6 January 2019,"My nephew and I ate a weed cookie and we were highly stoned watching this film. The best part was that we knew nothing of this movie. Neither of us seen a trailer of any kind and went into it blindly. I'm glad I did, because seeing a film you know nothing about and being high was an awesome experience.The film centers around a group of people having to get out of a series of rooms for a mere $10,000 dollars. When they find out how dangerous it is, I would be asking for a raise for all this crap. However, it's all very inventive and the scenes were pretty tense. I was at the edge of my seat.... of course I was high.However, the movie starts to derail towards the end and I predicted the ending and wished they didn't go that route. There are also some scenes where the dialogue between characters felt unnecessary. There's a fight between two characters that could have waited until they got out of there.However, I'm glad I saw it. The only way I could remember this movie is the fact it was the first movie of 2019 that I saw. It reminded me a lot of Saw, and I was entertained which was what I was asking for.",Escape Room

139,FKDZ,"Entertaining Movie and Concept, Weak script.",6,22 July 2021,"Overall I had fun with this movie, the concept is fantastic, especially if you are familiar with doing actual escape rooms but that also marks one of my first complaints. The movie really didn't allow us, the viewer: to puzzle along with the characters and solve things. Lots of solutions were quickly solved by a single character without us having quite the knowledge or layout of the room.A different style of directing would've made this movie immensely better, a slower pace where you would get much more a feeling for the space the people are in. Instead it focuses more on character and making you feel claustrophobic.The acting, hit and miss, its okay overall but the main letdown here is the dialog writing, its just not very good. In addition to that the characters don't feel very real, some of them definitely feel like caricatures and with the lines they say sometimes.. it reinforces that.The script, well. It's in the title I guess, the rest is vague and basically up to your imagination and the finale moments of the movie felt somewhat cheesy because it was so predictable. The script also really doesn't care about the details, which I found a bit annoying, making everything be like ""oké, I guess''.Music is pretty good, great at building up tension. Nothing special though.Directing is decent at times, had some great creative moments but felt a bit bland overall.Of course can't skip on the set design, is great though the puzzles themselves are not as intricate as I'd hoped.In general I don't think its a bad movie, just really want to see this concept use its full potential. 6/10.",Escape Room

141,mohit_sinsniwal,"To my surprise, I enjoyed this movie",7,24 May 2019,"Drawing influences from Saw (2004), Final Destination (2000), and Cube (1997), Escape Room follows six individuals, all of whom receive a puzzle box prescribing a cryptic note inviting them to the Minos Escape Room Facility. Lured to the facility under the promise of receiving a cash prize of ten thousand dollars, these six strangers must endure several intricately designed puzzle rooms in a thrilling game of life or death. While the premise doesn't exactly scream originality, Escape Room is a perfectly enjoyable little thriller. For those expecting buckets of gore and sickening death scenes, look elsewhere, as Schut and Melnik's screenplay is much more attuned to focusing on the elaborate puzzles themselves, resulting in a film that intrigues rather than disturbs. Pace wise, the film doesn't slow down and is engaging throughout, some of the puzzle rooms are quite visually arresting, and thankfully the characters aren't just one dimensional zeroes either. While the ending does border on nonsensical, Escape Room is a still a fun film that is definitely worth checking out.",Escape Room

147,eelen-seth,"Tight, fun little thriller with some spectacular vertigo inducing set pieces.",7,8 February 2019,"Escape Room isn't a horror-film, let's be very clear about that. It's a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat.The film opens by introducing half of the strangers we're about to get locked up with. Zoey (Taylor Russell) is a timid, intelligent college student who's been through some kind of trauma in her past. Jason (Jay Ellis - Insecure) is a confident yet cocky stock broker with a fight-or-die attitude. Ben (Logan Miller - Love, Simon) doesn't really know what he wants to be when he grows up, so losing himself in alcohol and chainsmoking is kind of his thing, in the meantime he works in the backroom of a hardware store. All of these people receive a gift from what seems to be people they work or study with. Once they crack open the invitation box itself, it points them into the direction of the location where the rest of the story will take place.Once arrived, we meet our other three contestants. Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll - Daredevil) is an Iraq veteran, Mike (Tyler Labine) the truck driver and Danny (Nik Dodani - Atypical) our escape room enthusiast. Before truly realising it, the game has already begun, and it becomes very clear that this is gonna be a fight-for-survival kinda game. Real flames, real hypothermia, real heights to fall from and so on.. But the game has some secrets of its own, especially Zoey seems to notice little references to events in their lives.There isn't any blood-splashing or limb-cutting present, but there are enough other ways to keep the tension building all the way to the end. This partially has to do with the exquisite art direction. Every escape room has its own soul and environment that looks expensive: a room that turns into a human-sized oven, a cabin in a snowy landscape where every step might cause you to freeze to death, an upside down bar. Every escape room breathes atmosphere and the creators have spend attention to detail.The script gets a little bit funny at times because you know it all takes place in a building - or does it?! - but a little round of applause to writers Maria Melnik and Bragi Schut is definitely deserved. It never feels like these are just some set pieces and they all have to die at some point, because you actually don't know what might or might not happen to them. Some might be displeased with the final reveal, but for me it felt like the studio knew what they were going for and yes, building up for a sequel that might or might not get made in the future. I wouldn't mind that all. Let's say, BRING IT!Escape Room could've easily been some sort of twist to revive the Saw-franchise, but I'm happy it isn't.

The cast is mostly grating and extremely annoying especially the guy that plays Jason. At least have a couple actors that don't seem like complete rookies so we can attempt to care about them although the awful script could be to blame for that aspect. The visuals are decently solid throughout and there are a few clever settings and devices. The sequel set up is so blatantly desperate at the end though I will definitely not be watching it. Overall it's just a rehash of the 2 films I mentioned set in cool escape rooms with utterly ridiculous plotting/scripting, with some moments of intrigue spliced throughout.

It's easy to rethink whether you wish to participate in an Escape Room, but basically it has a sort of a ""Saw"" feeling to it, which is tantamount to an adrenaline rush you get from both, except as you watch each character connect with each other in the Escape Room, you allow yourself to immerse in each excellent dialog, who they are and eventually the plot. If you haven't seen this movie, it's not THAT great a plot, but don't get me wrong, I'm paying attention to the several plot twists and turns and honestly, if I was stuck in these rooms with twists and turns to solve overall puzzles, it would be a fight to live in spite of how the rooms are designed to kill all of the players at one stage or the next. Also, the other actors in this movie are less well-known, except Molly Parker, who I've seen in other movies and basically she has no emotional depth in her acting, not like the other players like Jason Walker (Jay Ellis - Insecure) is among the other players in the room with her that is the complete opposite of Zoey, cut throat and unapologetically consumed with survival....

182,eparazak,"Half of this is a tense, yet fun thriller and the other half is extreme stupidity.",4,4 January 2019,"From the director of last year's ""Insidious: The Last Key"" comes Escape Room. This movie is about six different people who receive a cube through an unknown identity and are then invited to take part in an escape room challenge. If they lose, their lives are claimed.I went into this movie thinking it would be an intense, fun movie that would brighten up the mood for what's to come in the cinema. In a way, it gives us that, but when thinking about it, this movie also suffers from a large share of problems.This movie's biggest strength has got to be the tension that rises with the continuation of the movie. The situations that the main characters get stuck in are highly gripping and even a little discomforting. I think the movie handled this part excellently. Of the six main characters, there are two of them that stick out and act as very believable and had me rooting for them in particular. I think this is due to how they're better established than the others. As much as this is a benefit, this also does make the movie's end result feel predictable. I find the first half better however simply because of the fact that the movie seems to lose its momentum in the second one.I mention in the headline that the movie is pretty dumb in a lot of ways. I'm not simply talking about the decisions the characters take either. Yes, the characters make a lot of dumb and nonsensical decision during the second half, but there area bunch of other decisions that ruin the movie for me. I will talk briefly about them without spoiling. The motivation for bringing the characters together is generic and stupid. There is something that happens with the female lead in the last 15 minutes that makes no sense. Finally, the ending scenes seem to exist simply to set up a sequel and a franchise. The latter also feels last minute and that it was done in one draft considering that I was very confused while watching it.Look, if you just want a mindless thriller that you can watch and have fun with, this may be up your alley. Heck I would even agree with that statement myself, however, the second half really ruined it for me.4/10",Escape Room

One of the worst things is that there is very noticeable dubbing in the entire film, and i'm talking about The Room quality dubbing, I guess the dialogue was even worse or the acting was even more atrocious and they decided to dub every line.

It seemed to go from one thing to the next in nonstop action, which is what I love in a movie like this. There was never a dull moment.The only reason I didn't give it a 10/10 was because of the ending, although I could see them setting it up for a second movie which I would be pleased to watch! I also wished they would have showed the other contestants receiving their boxes since they only showed the few and how they came across theirs.

Last night, my wife watched this, and said it was one of ""my kind of movies."" As usual, she was right. This little gem is a tightly crafted thriller that reminds me a LOT of those first person puzzle games that I played on my PC back in the nineties. In fact, that is the basis of the film. ""What if you were thrust into a PC game that was life or death? Would you survive? This is the premise of the film and, much to my surprise, it works very well. Our characters are six seemingly random people, each with a hidden past. They receive little Hellraiser puzzle boxes that contain an invitation to play a game in a mysterious company high rise. There is a bit of expository interplay between the six invitees, and this sets the stage perfectly for the rest of the film. Once this film gets going, you half expect a safety bar to drop down over you because the thrills just keep coming. Simultaneously, our seemingly random players have their pasts laid bare.

Something about confined space thriller like the first Saw series or Cube offer a simplistic ending that will impact the audience more.

Great characters, ends well.",6,16 January 2021,"I found both this film and 'Cube' difficult to enjoy because of the frantic pacing, the tension and the circumstances that inevitably bring out the worst in people. Like being 'mired in the muck'. That being said...By the second half of the film, I began to really like the characters and that made a big difference. My favs within the film were Nik Dodani (who really nailed his role as a gamer geek), Taylor Russell (sweet, smart, shy/introvert), Logan Miller (playing the down on his luck, ""every dude"" kinda' role).I already loved Deborah Ann Woll from 'True Blood' and those great Netflix Marvel series; and Tyler Labine (a forever favorite from one of my all-time enjoyable series - 'Reaper').I really disliked Jay Ellis's character and this reaction is a testament to the remarkable work of this skilled actor.I think that if you like this type of premise, you'll enjoy this film - a 7+ rating. It isn't as powerful as 'Cube' but it doesn't fail in what it attempts to accomplish. If you're on the fence about this type of film (like I am: ie, I wouldn't see Cube or this film again - too frantic, knotty stomach), the characters will either make it or break it for you.

Lured to the facility under the promise of receiving a cash prize of ten thousand dollars, these six strangers must endure several intricately designed puzzle rooms in a thrilling game of life or death. While the premise doesn't exactly scream originality, Escape Room is a perfectly enjoyable little thriller. For those expecting buckets of gore and sickening death scenes, look elsewhere, as Schut and Melnik's screenplay is much more attuned to focusing on the elaborate puzzles themselves, resulting in a film that intrigues rather than disturbs. Pace wise, the film doesn't slow down and is engaging throughout, some of the puzzle rooms are quite visually arresting, and thankfully the characters aren't just one dimensional zeroes either.

218,thirtyfivestories,SONY's New Saw Franchise Knows How to Clear a Room,3,29 January 2019,"Exactly one year after his last feature film that saw him ending (fingers-crossed) the outlived Insidious franchise, Adam Robitel returns to begin another franchise that surely will not have the lifespan of the one it is imitating. He delivers a pilot installment that maybe only Jason Blum would be proud of, hitting various Blumhouse beats with more enthusiasm than even last year's game-to-film adaption Truth or Dare managed. These Blumian (a descriptor I am pained to invent) tropes include characters reading aloud text like a zealous mother, a clunky ten minute group ice-breaking session that clinically checks all the expository boxes, and the ""twist-ception(s)"".Six individuals all receive the same elegantly quirky puzzle box from colleagues and loved ones. Ben, a grocery boy, attempts to use brute force to open the cube, while Zoey, a physics student scribbles diagrams and notes as she unlocks what is an invitation to the world's most immersive escape room. Jason, a financial wizard, utilizes YouTube tutorials to crack his gift, and apparently the $10,000 prize for escaping still appeals to a man who initially expected a Prius key when his package first arrived. After all the participants are gathered in a waiting room of a seemingly barren high-rise, we're introduced to a happy-go-lucky trucker dad, a gamer boy turned escape room enthusiast, and an intimidating woman (her caricature is revealed later) rounding out the players now trapped in what will become an architecturally perplexing series of rooms.The clues scattered throughout the rooms are just barely more subtle than the hints plopped into the dialogue revealing the unifying trait of all the participants. It is far from a spoiler to comment on how painfully obvious that the escape room is more a social experiment than a game. However, our gamer boy Danny tries his darndest to immerse us into the game by effectively giving a ""Escape Rooms 101"" lecture to the gang. Trucker dad Mike eats this up with great appreciation as will many audiences who aren't privy to the new entertainment craze. This goes beyond exposition dumping, and feels eerily similar to an in-game tutorial, which oddly enough, doesn't feel right in a movie.Where the film lacks creativity in character development, its set design flourishes with imaginative decisions that tie into the players' pasts with relative frequency, providing a human anchor to an otherwise procedural death trot similar to the cult beloved Cube. An upside down jukebox bar steals the show by offering the most integrated use of clues worthy of an indie walking simulator game remake. But collect all the rooms together, and the difficulty curve resembles a goose bump: not challenging in the slightest. I knew that this would be where this film lived or died, and it perished early into the first room when I hacked the game's system and saw a much more efficient solution involving glasses and a couch. I effectively mentally speed-ran the rooms in an effort to milk joy from my viewing.If predictability is the film's greatest sin, then the dialogue is the lesser sin. The performances from the auxiliary characters are particularly rigid, but this too can be blamed on down-right lazy writing that at one point has a college professor give our wiz kid Zoey an extracurricular homework assignment of ""doing one thing that scares you"". Yet I'm still fearful of a potentially greater sin lurking in the closing moments of what I'll call the fourth act of an otherwise brisk movie: the sequel(s) option. The same blue-balls Netflix original series ""binge me some more daddy"" gut punch arose, and now SONY's plan was revealed. Once again, I do not view this as being in the spoiler family, because what is inevitable is inevitable.Now only time will tell if they can rise to sustained success that Twisted Pictures basked in with the 8-film series chronicling a sinister puzzle designer. The difference here is tragically obvious, Escape Room's puzzle designer is totally morally deprived. There must be a method to the madness, this mastermind only has business propelling their madness, which I'm saddened to report doesn't generate the intriguing tension between torturer and victim that its gorier predecessors at least attempted to balance. Speaking of gore, my first ""so PG-13 is what we're going to do?"" badge of 2019 goes to this gem for copying the formula, but diluting it in the process. A worthy excuse to create a dungeon crawler thriller I will admit, but contrary to gamer boy Danny's hilariously ignorant exclamation after barely evading flames, this one is far from immersive.",Escape Room

224,Netscape_Navigator,Fun escape movie,8,25 October 2021,"This was fun and suspenseful. The characters are written in a very basic way, but just enough to move along with the plot.The most annoying character was the businessman. It's unrealistic that a person in that position wouldn't know how to talk to other humans. In general, the writers had characters say things that made so little sense. For example, the businessman made a comment about ""survival of the fittest,"" after one of their friends had died, except she died sacrificing herself. One of the characters corrects him on that, and so then he says let's not waste her sacrifice. Ok, that line makes sense, but why would he even say that first line in the first place?There was another part where the businessman tried to insinuate that another character had caused the death of another. So that character the starts defending himself, and the businessman cuts him off and says to forget all that and to get back on task or something. Wait, YOU'RE the one that just accused him of MURDER, what do you mean ""forget all that,"" ***you're the one that brought it up.***The biggest thing that annoyed me was the way the girl reacted at the end when she went with the police back to the initial escape room, which is now in a completely burned up state since that's how they left it originally (it burned up after they left). She storms in and starts frantically talking about how this was the lobby, and how such and such was over here, and just going on and on. Let me break this down....* First off, why is she so SURPRISED that the room looks like this now?? How's it supposed to look? You have no idea exactly what happened to the place after you and your friends crawled through the duct. But, you have some idea that it probably burned right? Then.....how is the way the room looks now NOT consistent with that? In other words, what is it about the way the room looks now that immediately triggered her alarm bells that ""omg, someone is trying to cover their tracks by making it look like the escape room never existed and that I'm crazy."" What are you talking about, this looks EXACTLY the way I'd expect an escape room to look after an inferno had gone through it. And if she didn't know that an inferno had gone through it, then she has even less reason to be surprised about the way it looks now since she has no idea what happened to it after they left. It looks like a crazy room where crazy stuff happened. Her reaction would've made more sense if the place had been in *pristine* condition.* She's frantically going on and on about what the room looked like as if someone had already doubted her. No one had even said anything yet, and she's already reacting like her story is suspicious, trying with all her might to convince people that for all she knew, already believed her.* When she does mention some area of the room and what it used to be, the policeman IMMEDIATELY says there's no evidence of that. So that's it. You're not going to ask any questions, you just immediately assume she must be crazy?It's really not that hard to write good dialogue. Yes, it's hard to write a story, but dialogue isn't hard. You just picture what a normal human being would say given that circumstance, however fantastical or not.",Escape Room

The acting could be better and it's the females that save the day. Deborah Ann Woll is a veteran when it comes to bad scripts and can act here way out of a badly written room every day of the week. Newcomer Taylor Russell manages to do a somewhat convincing job, But the rest of them.... yeah...Anyway. The really good part of this movie is the pace. It's very well-balanced and the production is just good enough that you don't notice it. I never had the time to think about lighting and/or camera, I was to busy following along with the plot.The problem with movies like this is that we as the audience is often several step ahead of the characters and we already have some idea of what twists and turns are coming up. And that tends to ruin movies like this.
And let's be honest, It is very very hard to fool the audience today. This movie would have been a masterpiece in the late 80's, but now it just feels: Meh.Anyway, I enjoyed it for what it is: A popcorn movie you can watch on a rainy weekend when you have nothing better to do.",Escape Room

253,TheJohnnyPHreak,PG-13 Saw Clone With Some Decent Moments,5,10 January 2019,"I always worry about PG-13 horror movies. This is only because I think that most horror movies should be R Rated. I know that before the gorefest that was the late 70's and 80's, some horror movies were PG and when PG-13 was created they were rated that as well. I'm not always looking for gore when I think of a horror movie. (Yes, sometimes it helps) But I want to genuinely terrified, scared out of my mind and sucked into a horror film. I believe in order to achieve the level of deep-seated terror the film has to get under your skin, and the R Rating gives some freedom to do so.Yes, there are great horror films that are PG (Jaws, Poltergeist, and Gremlins come to mind). I also know that there are some good to great PG-13 horror films out there (The Monster Squad, Drag Me To Hell, The Others). But with the lastest run of ""scary movies,"" PG-13 usually means the kiss of death for a film.In walks our latest addition to the PG-13 horror genre, Escape Room from Sony. This film playing off the big crazy now of escape rooms follows six strangers who all get invited to tests their wits and limits in an escape room. What they don't know is that failure has dire consequences. There are a few twists in the film that's why I won't really diverge into more of the plot. Each character does have their own arch, some last longer than others I can say that. The cast featuring Deborah Ann Woll (The Punisher, Daredevil), Logan Miller (Love Simon), Tyler Labine (Tucker & Dale vs. Evil), Nik Dodani (Murphy Brown, Atypical), Taylor Russell (Netflix's Lost In Space) and Jay Ellis (HBO's Insecure) do the best with their characters.They all play atypical characters in a film like this. There's the woman with more than meets the eye, the easy-going dad, the escape room junkie, the shy nerd, the lonely stockboy and the rich exec out for himself. Each actor brings enough to the role to keep your interested when things hit the fan. Ann Woll being the standout with the most harrowing back story and the single best character moment in the film. One thing the film does well it when a backstory is shown for a character it's natural. We start off with three main characters but each has something that is revealed during the game. It's a good example of show and tell.But there isn't really that much time to dive deep in the character drama because this is a movie about putting our characters in crazy situations. The film is very unique with each type of escape room. That a positive quality for a film like this. Its lack of gore is replaced with creativity. Each room is different and at times built for a specific character. When the film is at is best is when the tension. That comes not as often as it should. But I will say there is an extended sequence in the middle is pure edge of your seat fun. It's shot very well making sure not one character is the focus but giving the spotlight to all of them. I was trembling, hands sweaty during this. I will definitely give director Adam Robitel credit because this sequence was well time and a highlight of the film.The issue is after this great sequence the film kind of falls apart. The following escape room is more for exposition than thrills. The end is where the whole thing unravels. We are treated to a lengthy explanation of what's going on, a twist of sorts that leads to the set up for a sequel. And I'm not surprised there might be a sequel on the way. The film has nods to Saw, Final Destination and Cube which all have multiple sequels. If the ending was left up in the air and some sequences replaced I would have enjoyed the film more. It got me all revved up then failed to deliver on something I didn't see coming.With the film doubling its budget in its opening weekend, it's only a matter of time when Sony will announce Escape Room 2. The film has definite moments of excitement and tension. But those are few and far between. I'm not saying the film should have been longer. But give the characters more depth and layers. I wanted to be sucked in. I wanted to care for them when some awful happens. Ultimately, outside of one, I really just wanted to see everyone die awfully (that says something about me right?). Here's hoping the sequel doubles down on the rooms and gets the characters right from the getgo. I'd rather not say Escape Room is a PG-13 but it basically is.",Escape Room

The movie gets going once it enters its first escape room and it's pretty intense as it moves along from room to room . Amazing set designs and interesting ideas involving each characters backstories scattered throughout the puzzles really help this . The actors also really are well casted , except for the main jerk of the bunch who's acting and dialogue get old fast and the troupes of the rich jerk seem tired and a little bizarre at times. Another problem is the directing on some of the flashbacks which feel very fake and don't match the rest of the movie. The film also begins with a flashforward kind of ruining some of the twists. The biggest problem is the end , it doesnt end , its sequel bait ,something these films have to learn to do better . end on an interesting twist involving our characters , don't add scene after scene ... it really ruined the momentum.

What follows is sort of a plot that resembles the movie Saw, but with escape rooms instead of one room.You are constantly invested in seeing what is going to happen next because escape rooms are about finding clues in order to escape. The plot does show you that there is some reasoning behind how the participants find clues, but often times you are just along for the ride. The great majority of this movie takes place in the escape rooms.The dialogue in this film disappointed at times. Participants would sometimes bicker with one another instead of trying to help each other. The actors are nothing special and the plot is only loosely explained regarding why the participants were chosen.But it is a fun movie to watch.

275,madsmartinussen,Ignore and enjoy,7,6 August 2021,"My first impression of this film was that it was riddled with ridiculous elements. The characters are cliches, the dialogue is dumb, the acting is at best mediocre and the direction is horrible. I almost turned it off, but I'm glad I didn't. I would almost swear (if I didn't know how ridiculous the notion is) that they shot and edited this chronologically, and everyone needed about 10 scenes before the started to know what they were doing, because the film picks up at about 20 minutes in. Everything just seemed to get better, the dialogue, the acting, the characters. Or maybe, and more likely, the plot just took off, and I decided to ignore the dumb little things and just go with it. At about 35 minutes in I was thoroughly entertained. To be clear, this is not a brilliant movie. It's a thrilling semi horror flick, pretty clearly intended for teenagers, something of a retread of ideas from other YA films, and at 15 years old I would have absolutely loved the hell out of this film. At 31, I quite simply enjoyed myself.",Escape Room

I thought in escape rooms you are working together and share all the info, you shouldn't be keeping anything away. First room and all the weights... You could solve it in different ways. And all this ""let's try this"" when they know it could make the situation worse is weird. Staying sweat in -30-40° in shirt for so long and one of them even passed out but only till the doors open and he's ready to run. Escape room specialist for some reason drop under the ice and moving away - for some reason everybody start blaming guy who should loose on foot. How they decide what the game is about in each room is really strange how could you come up that lock asking for 2nd word of band which was playing when you crash car with your friends few ours years later all this by letters on trophies. All those cliffhangers were plain stupid and they're killing chars just to eliminate them for next room. Room with antidote - so if noone dies only two would have the poison magically get to you through skin. How come that the first guy didn't have symptoms till then 2nd guy touched it? Why not to use half of the antidote and share with 2nd guy? Good that the last room was so easy that grocery guy could solve it even he got the nomination for the game by throwing the black cube out the ground and mostly not came up with anything apart magically guess trophies. Ok in ""win"" room last guy was higher... But really you can lift up and strangle adult at least 75kg heavy adult fighting for life? Well he wasn't really human since ebony shot him twice and he teleported from only place he could hide with his large body and still be able to attack that girl. For some reason they had visible cams only in rooms and not in the rest of the complex. If you make a movie about solving puzzles you should avoid this mistakes and think it through. I'm not sure, that if I'm business man with own office and assistant I would be interested to spend my time to win $10k. Everything is times so if you like this ""stress out"" Scarry movies which don't really have deep meaning and you just want to discuss it with bunch of people and making fun of it - go for it.

Some decide to participate due to barely being able to get by on their work salary while others are wealthy and successful and seem interested in the ""Escape Room"" only for pure amusement purposes or perhaps to challenge themselves mentally.Regardless of why they decide to join, once they arrive and the ""Escape Room"" begins it quickly becomes clear that this is no simple harmless game, the stakes are deadly and the consequences are real, and if they can't find a way to escape it very well may mean the end of not the game, but their very lives!",Escape Room

Once they're inside the escape room the movies vibe stays exactly the same throughout the entire movie. No build-up tension. Nothing. So out of boredom I started to analyze the performances of the actors. They acted too dramatic imo and it just didn't seem real enough. For example: they're in this cold environment, but none of the actors were able to portray a realistic performance of a person who's suffering from hyperthermia. For me this was the moment I lost interest.Let's take 'Alita: Battle Angle' for example, despite being a somewhat shallow sci-fi flick this movie gave me an overall entertaining vibe. Escape Room simply does not! So I left the cinema dissatisfied..To sum it up: poorly executed script + bad acting = your typical cheap nonsensical Hollywood Garbage Movie.On a positive note: I loved seeing Deborah Ann Woll, she's a rare on-screen gem imo.

What I liked was how details about the characters were presented, how they were used as a nexus to tie the characters to specific puzzle elements in each of the rooms. The Escape Room was more original from other movies I've seen of this type. Lastly, the level of action from start to finish was good, and it kept me watching to see what would happen next.

What impressed me most was the characterization enabled me to actually care for the players and had me rooting for them to survive, whereas in the typical genre film I can't wait for them to die. 6/10.",Escape Room

The different escape rooms were inventive and clever, the storyline was easy to follow and there were some good twists.

341,petereviews,An Adequate Afternoon Escape,6,8 September 2019,"The Good: I had no intention of watching this film until reviews consistently said it was worth an afternoon tv watch, which I have to agree after watching it for free.Wisely steering away from horror, the movie is a fun little thriller, ratcheting the tension up in each escape room. These escape rooms are the highlight of the movie, as some of the clues to solve them are particularly clever, especially in the first room.While I expected the characters to be detestable, I was surprised to find most of them likeable and for me to actually be rooting for them. While they are cliches, they bounce off each other quite well.The Bad: The actively bad section was the final 20 minutes where it becomes revealed why these people were put there. The explanation was ridiculous, and it was very shameless how the movie did it's sequel-bait.Apart from this, nothing was actively bad apart from this movie not being particularly exceptional.Film Highlight: In the first escape room where the characters find out things are not what they seem. The tension here was raised magnificently.Conclusion: Recommend watching as a light afternoon or evening watch.",Escape Room

346,kim_smoltz,An impossibly frustrating mess of a movie,4,8 May 2019,"Some may call this movie a ""roller coaster ride,"" and I would be inclined to agree with that, but in a far different context -- instead of it being a case of a film taking me on exciting twists and turns on a fast paced level, it was my overall enjoyment of the film that took so many sharp turns. In the end, it just left me with a massive headache.Let me get right into this: the writing in this movie is excruciatingly awful. It was the first thing that immediately caught my attention in the first ten minutes, and it almost made me want to turn the movie off. Not only is the dialogue abominable and awkward, the screenplay just makes me want to scream. We all expected ""Escape Room"" to be an updated and remastered version of ""Cube"" (1997), yes. The screenplay tries to achieve this and then shoots for the moon by trying to include ""Final Destination"" type mythology in the final thirty minutes. It fails spectacularly, and the ending of the film is simply incomprehensible.There are plot holes so huge, you'd think there were several pages missing in random locations of the final screenplay and they just decided to go ahead with filming anyway. Remember the episode of ""The Simpsons"" when the popcorn truck hits the giant pothole and all the popcorn erupts over the street? Yeah. Reminds me of the writing in this film.In most scenes, the acting doesn't mitigate any of the horrible dialogue. There are a few exceptions due to solid performances by Deborah Ann Woll and Danny Khan. They brought enough to the table to give their own brand of life and personality to their characters; for the rest of the cast, their acting ranged from average to borderline dismal, rendering their characters stale and at the mercy of the terrible screenplay.Despite all of this, the film succeeds in having fun while we are locked in the rooms (which thankfully make up almost the entire movie). I'd be lying if I said I wasn't enjoying myself during most of these sequences. The danger is real, but instead of relying on ""Saw"" type threats that end with maximum torture and bloodshed, the deaths in ""Escape Room"" are tamer and yet just as (or more) effective. There are some really suspenseful moments that are directed well -- not enough of them -- but they are there. If you can ignore the terrible writing (as I tried to do), it's easy to have fun with the movie during the bulk of it. Plus the cinematography is really solid, and for two of the rooms, is absolutely genius. The production design is also great across the board, and enhanced the level of fun.So this is what I mean when I say there were moments that had me rethinking my overall thoughts on the movie. ""Wow, this is getting much better now!"" is swiftly replaced with ""This is excruciatingly awful,"" and it went back and forth like a ping-pong ball. When the atrocious ending sequence begins, everything just goes out the window, and the rest of the movie is pretty much spoiled. I envision the screenwriter finishing the last page and then just throwing everything into the air.It's impossibly frustrating, as impossible as some of the puzzles depicted in the movie. ""Escape Room"" could've been great. As a wide release PG-13 horror thriller, it could have been ""Cube"" for Generation Z. The production team was clearly capable of it.But it wasn't. So go rewatch ""Cube"" instead of this.",Escape Room

It is reminding me of the cube the journey they faced through each event and someone died in each room. I saw the story the had in place for each survivor and had the rooms connected to each one, but they the tropes they had for character seemed to shift back and forth as the Black guy and teen guy both seemed like the were playing the negative mean character throughout the beginning and some middle of the film for it to turn around and them both to have good moments. It came down to the Black man being the secondary antagonist but for him to be left in the anticlimactic way in the poison room seems like the killed it off too quick and I would have appreciated a chase seen after he had the antidote just for Zoie to help the teen guy get the antidote the ending wasn't bad as it seems to be setting up a squeal to which I will watch if one comes and enjoy it if they keep it good and hopefully make it better then this one",Escape Room

364,CronenbergsMonster,Falls apart at the end,5,12 August 2020,"Dont believe the 10/10 or the 1/10 reviews. This movie falls almost squarely in the middle. The premise is essentially a PG-13 Saw movie with multiple puzzle rooms for the protagonists to escape (rather than torture devices). There are some really great set pieces, tense moments, and decent acting throughout. However, the film completely falls apart in the last act. Its clearly meant to be setup for a franchise, which completely belittles everything in the first 3/4 of the film and ruins all the goodwill established up to that point. This could have been a really competent thriller if it werent for the money-grabbing shill of an ending.

I did see the trailer and it gave me strong ""Saw"" vibes so I went in thinking it'd be a saw copycat without the impact.While there are ""saw"" and ""hostel"" elements , this film add it's own flavor to the survival film franchise. Throughout the film we get short glimpses of each characters' tragic past which helps us as the audience actually care about these people. There is something for mostly everybody to relate to so it can sorta feel like you could be in this situation. And that's the beauty of a film , making the audience feel in that moment like they are there.The acting is hit or miss at times and there are a few corny lines, but above all this was an intense film that was also comical at times. It seemed to have taken inspiration from a plethora of survival films and kind of merged them into one film , using an original modern day scenario ; seeing as though escape rooms have become very popular in recent years.Creepy , Intense, Gut Churning, and Funny.

366,illuminatilights01,Another 40 minutes and this would have been a great movie,7,17 June 2019,"The ""meat"" of this film is well done. You'll experience a range of emotions as you watch characters not only navigate to escape but also learn about each other. There's a fair amount of development that happens as they progress through the game but it's not sufficient to develop the empathy needed. A few more minutes in the beginning doing so, from their respective paths in addition to what takes place during the game would have been great. But that would be auxiliary to the NEEDED time for the denounment of this film, which does a disservice to all the talent in the first 130 minutes. Rushed, incongruent and sloppy are what come to mind, obviously they are trying to set up escape room 2 but they could have done so a bit more gracefully.

As a claustrophobic horror movie where the characters are killed one by one by puzzles you would expect some more imagination and shock values.I watched it to the end, so it kept me interested late at night.Not sure why this has a 15 certificate.

390,Firetears_X,It does what it's supposed to do,6,4 January 2019,"Let's be honest: no one is watching this movie with crazy expectations. If you're expecting a decent thriller under the condition that you suspend all belief, that's exactly what you're going to get with this movie. It's nothing amazing here but it did have potential to get a full 7 stars had it not been for a lazy plot twist involving the character Jason.All of the characters throughout the movie are revealed to have been sole survivors in freak accidents that killed everyone else involved. Jason, for example, was lost in the middle of the ocean with his roommate. It is revealed in the third act that Jason killed his roommate so that he could have a better chance of surviving. Revealing Jason to be a psychopath works well as a plot twist out of context but in the context of the movie it was lazily done.Jason wasn't shown the be the greatest guy of the bunch. In fact, he quickly shrugged off a couple deaths before the villainous reveal but he also had moments of consideration. It's assumed that he killed his roommate so that he wouldn't have to share a winter jacket under freezing conditions but during the game he had no qualms with sharing the winter jacket. There was also a room where the movie's lead, Zoey, nearly died had she not been saved by Jason who risked his life for her. I guess the hints to his true character was his ability to shake off the deaths of complete strangers.And while I'm on the discussion of complete strangers, you have to love a movie that spells out just how dispensable their characters are. The movie starts with introductions to Zoey, Jason, and Ben living their everyday lives before entering the escape room. Then, once they go into the escape room, the movie introduces three other characters who come from nowhere. You know right away that those three are going to die for sure just based on the fact that they appeared from thin air.During the beginning of the third act, Zoey decides to fight back by destroying all of the cameras in a room that's designed to poison the players. I loved that the lead decided to fight back instead of playing but, again, the execution was lazily done and absolutely depended on belief suspension. Zoey, under the effects of poison gas, faints to the ground, foaming at the mouth while she does so. A few scenes later, it's revealed that she used an oxygen mask from the ceiling to survive the gas attack. However, that scenario alone comes with many questions. Why would the game master even bother putting an oxygen mask in the room if he wants all of the players to die? And am I expected to believe that Zoey got back up after *nearly (I suppose)* choking to death?And then there's also that big brother element that lacks any realism. Everything in the building that supported the impossible escape rooms disappeared in the matter of a few hours. If I was foolish enough to believe that an enormous crew could dismantle six escape rooms in a few hours then it still wouldn't explain the willingness for everyone involved. It relies on Purge logic in that there are millions of people who are into observing and creating violence.All of that said, it ended on a great note where Zoey is trying to hunt down the game master. It actually has me very interested in a sequel; assuming we get to see more of Zoey being a vengeful badass.",Escape Room

The acting is ok I guess and it's reasonably fun to watch, this is unfortunately severely undermined by it not really making any sense whatsoever and incredibly poor essentially none existent character development.I will give them one thing though the last room I did NOT expect that and it was a fun way to wrap it up.If you turn your brain off it's worth a watch once but easily forgettable.",Escape Room

There were a million ways to end a movie like this, that was very fun to watch, but these days movies have to leave things open to make you want to see a sequel. Why can't we just get complete movies and then come up with whole new ideas for a sequel in case it is a hit (like in the good old days of the 80's and 90's).

411,barca_AW,Disapointing and cliched,4,25 March 2019,"Escape Room is a movie that is based on the different Escape Room games, which developed recently and got quite popular. The games are often smart and require some serious thinking. Unfortunatly you can not say this about the Movie. Escpae Room is a cliched and mediacore film, that is almost entirely predictable. From the beginning you can clearly see the formulated screenplay in front of your eyes. Every Child can see the build up of the different standard characters and knows from the beginning which one is going to survive. A positive thing is that the rooms in the movie were designed pretty clever and even thought you know the outcome the scenes were very thrilling. The acting and the music was not worth mentioning.Overall Escape Room was disapointing because of the clear potential the movie had. It turned out to be another Hollywood scheme A formula movie. The director did nothing to improve the mediacore script and so it turned out to be another forgettable movie. Watch this on a sunday afternoon if you have nothing to do and want to see a less good hollywood movie. 4/10",Escape Room
412,karlakreso,Could've been better,8,16 April 2019,"I really liked the movie, there were good scenes filled with anticipation but how the events played out in the end kinda ruined the movie and I'm talking about the part where that game master or whatever dude tries to kill that long haired dude, that girl comes in and shoots him. And I'm pretty sure I saw blood if my eyes weren't playing tricks on me but the dude just gets up and runs like nothing happened and when he attackes girl there's shot of his back and there's no gunshot wound whatsoever. Also when that girl escapes her room how exactly did she find her way to those two?? I don't suppose it should be easy since the building is huge I mean I know that's the plot and something that has to happen for the story to keep going. But still. Escaping the room was also easy... oh and I forgot this, when that long haired dude got strangled he was dead, there was x over his picture, then he came back to life. Same thing happened with the girl there was x over her then she came back and that game master dude was thrown into the game like how does that work?? Is that camera supper smart? She knows when people die, when people are alive, she understands what is going on so she can make decisions in game orrr is there someone behind camera if there is then that girl couldn't have escaped bc I suppose there are cameras everywhere in that place and people behind this surely wouldn't have left their own people to die especially if they're important. Which that dude was. Also how did they know every single detail about them? Especially in situations like them singing car in a song. How would you know that? Maybe dude mentioned it when he was in a hospital but I don't like them(people behind this)being portrayed like gods, knowing every single little detail. I want an explanation how they got to that information.
Again it's good movie I really enjoyed it, but they could've put a little more effort into it.",Escape Room
413,Lucas-Thor,Escape Room review,6,6 January 2020,"Escape room (2019)Escape room starts of with a scene that comes into play later. This was not something i liked. Throughout the whole movie I knew who was gonna be the last one standing, because of that first scene. It ruined a bit of the fun in guessing who was gonna survive. Now the end of the movie makes up for the first scene, which i am happy it did. Anyway, let's go back to the start.Six strangers gets invited to this ""escape room"". The six character are very stereotypical, but i didn't mind. One thing i did mind was that i didn't care for any of them. I thought someone was the main character, but she honestly didn't do much in a big chunk of the movie. MAny of the other character i found relatively annoying. So the characters weren't the best part of the movie.The premise i found rather fun. I like movies like this, were a few different characters has to make it through different rooms, all with lethal challenges. I think the rooms in this movie are all good and creative. So that part i liked. I liked how the room were connected and all the challenges. You do have to accept this movies reality though. It is not exactly the most realistic movie.Minor spoiler.The ending sets up for a sequel and honestly, even though this movie was kinda dumb and the ending was really dumb, I don't mind and I would probably enjoy a sequel.
Final thoughts:
If you can turn off your brain, accept this movies reality and ignore the characters(and maybe skip the first scene) This movie can be a fun watch. I admit that is quite a lot you have to do to enjoy this movie and i get that, therefore many will probably dislike this movie a lot and i won't argue. But i found this kinda fun.6/10",Escape Room

At almost the end, the story seems quite unique when they can break the escape room and kill the maker (when usually it always ending with the last one or the winner is still trap or die). But it turns out that the corporation still exist and they're still targeting the last two who survived (and it's back to the usual storyline). So i was relieved but turns to dissapoinment with the ending, the creators is really forcing it to have a sequel (which i think isn't really needed, it's supposed to be a one movie but with great storyline). But the way they try to dig more from each character's background is good. The movie is enjoyable so i would recommend it if you like this kind of movie, but the movie is really loud.",Escape Room

A lot of horror films minus a few gems generally tend to have terrible acting and dialogue and rehashed plot lines. This movie is no exception and if you can accept that it can be an enjoyable movie to watch. I can say I thought the escape rooms were creativity built and I legitimately felt my anxiety rise out of the anticipation of whether the players were going make it out of rooms, which is what the film is designed to do. In terms of set design and production it looked well produced and felt more like an actual film then most of trash being made today. I believe most horror fans will enjoy this film as a 1x watch but certainly not worthy of buying for film collectors. Unfortunately with rehashed stories with plot lines such as this, they typically limited to a one film shelf life as the script just becomes stupider and stupider.

The kind that's both boring and irritating. Thinks it's clever but tries too hard to be edgy while holding itself back from being R. As the main actress is introduced, a line is mentioned and I think ""A little on the nose on character development, ain't you?"" Things go in a horrible downward spiral from there.
Each character has a generic background we've seen hundreds of times, no innovation in the puzzles (per se), each character is a one-dimensional archetype than anything. About 2/3 through, I realize this film is just a borderline PG-13/R remake of The Cube, which is superior in every way. Story, characters, action, plot twists, environmental structure, everything.

The overall plot and the overall reason why they create this escape room is ridiculous and unrealistic. While they starts the movie with some complicated-looking-genius-like logic that I'll never google, this movie seems like something that will twist your brain along with how they twist the way they escape from the deadly rain, but as much as the casts need cleverness in finding the way out, the movie doesn't offer us the same genius start to end this. It even ends ridiculously and I must say, stupidly. They died worthlessly. And this what makes me so disappointed.

Even so, the ""rooms"" in this file are very impressive, especially the winter scene, with unique details and outcomes.Given the fact that Zoe is so intelligent and sensible, it made no sense at all that she would get the police involved after surviving. Clearly she, and the other survivor, would've known full well to vanish away and stay quiet, for fear of being whisked away back into the Escape a Room. And then the inevitable happens with the bad guys telling us they have already located Zoe, because she didn't stay quiet, and will be kidnapped once again and go through the torment.

And despite the cast giving it their all the characters in this movie lack more development, some times they all come off as a-holes, and other times you wanna root for them.The escape room ideas themselves don't seem as fleshed out enough, they could have been more interesting ideas around this premise but it all felt very standard. while tense in some places, the pacing didn't let you sink in that time to really feel that suspense.Average movie overall with a good premise and good acting, but very little in terms of interest.

The cube was slightly more complex and honestly better even though as a whole not that good. The high ratings come from those basically born yesterday who don't remember the cube. I'm in my 20s and even I remember this movie. The acting is bad, the plot is bad and at the end they rob the feeling of justice from you leaving you feeling extremely empty and dissatisfied. Its amazing that they keep still make movies this bad and wonder why people don't go to the movies anymore. The cube, although a little futuristic for the time, was believable how the rooms were set up and how they moved. This however is not. The rooms are incredibly complex with tons of furniture and intricacies and to make it even more unbelievable at the end of the movie they make every detail put into the rooms, as well as the rooms themselves, pretty much disappear.

462,SpencerPEvans,A Puzzle with Red Herrings,7,5 November 2019,"As a whole, the movie was pretty cool. I would be lying if I said that this movie was absolutely terrible or even THAT painful to watch. It does have an interesting premise... for the most part.The characters are kind of standard, the shy smart student, the annoying geek, the stoner, the militant, the boss, the unwise friend, it's kind of run-of-the-middle in that area.The story has some promise, but it does have MASSIVE flaws that I think a lot of people overlook. The escape room company, Minos Escape Rooms, has customized the rooms entirely for the players. How the players they intended to show up all happened to show up? I don't know, but there's the start. Once this was realized, I have to question, ""If the puzzles are customized to their backstories, why is it so hard for them to solve?"" I mean, it's like giving me a locked box, where the password is ""14"" just because that's my favorite number and it's decorated to everything I enjoy. I'm pretty sure I would've figured it out sooner.I will give credit that the puzzle room designs are pretty gosh darn creative: the oven, the lake, the upside-down billiard room, and the zebra paint job do deserve a mention. It's just frustrating when the characters can't seem to solve easy puzzles or even just simple scenarios, like the fact that the lady at the desk was just a recording. It's even worse when there's no logical way to solve the puzzle. For instance, in the first room, the oven waiting area, you can find the solution WITHOUT turning on the oven. And the characters had to decide to take a fire extinguisher to HIT A DOOR before they find a key. When there's no logic to the puzzles, it's kind of annoying to watch or even care.One big flaw the movie made was spoiling one of its own rooms for us. It starts off with one of the characters all alone in a room where one of the walls is closing in on him. Clever room, but in the previous room, there's a painful fight scene, and the timing couldn't be worse. We're down to two players, but they're in the black-and-white painted room, with drugs in the air to mess with their vision, with a spinning floor, with intense strobe lights, and the footage was super choppy with its editing; it legitimately hurt my eyes to watch, and I'm not even epileptic. Plus, I already know who makes it through alive since we already saw the ""last"" survivor!The ending of the movie is poorly made, I'm sorry. Minos somehow was able to make the business just disappear off the face of the planet with, supposedly, no evidence. Yep. No evidence of the amount of power required to heat up a thousand square foot room to almost 500 degrees, cool a two-thousand square foot room to below freezing, the walls required to hold a couple thousand gallons of ice cold water, the gigantic elevator shaft required for the billiard room, or even the website. All of it, gone in just the nick of time. And it all leads to an 'omnipotent puppetmaster' cliche in the movie, which made this frustrating.The only thing is that I can hope that there are not only better rooms, but better character and better puzzles. I genuinely want to see a well made movie based on the concept of escape rooms, and I'm hoping that the 2020 sequel will lead up to it.",Escape Room

In saw games, you must usually torture your body to escape the trap, in this one it slightly smarter and also little more fun. The ending is disappointing and reminded me a lot of cabin in the woods, but no good.
When in saw movies you get most of the times why characters end up in the game and you learn their backstory, then in this one most of the five players don't deserve any of it and we only learn who they are from really short back flashes. And in the end, none of that matters because spoilers the game makers kill everyone off anyway. So conclusion movie started off as interesting and exciting and fell quickly boring and submit.

I do have to say, once it got to the point with the final two characters (the drug sequence) it fell a little bit for me. I would still see the sequel though. Another thing that amazed me was the quality of the cinematography and editing. Visually captivating and disturbing. Lastly, I have to give credit to the cast.

Because you create impaty with the characters. Sometimes you get emotional when they die in some part of the movie. I really recommend but it's not for everyone.,Escape Room
482,jcosully,A Surprisingly Entertaining January Horror/Thriller,8,5 January 2019,"In comparison to other January thrillers, Escape Room definitely stands out against the others. It excels ahead of Insidious: The Last Key, The Bye Bye Man, The Forest, And The Woman In Black 2: Angel Of Death, which are all January releases. Granted, Escape Room isn't amazing, not even great, but it is definitely a step forward in the right direction. I would definitely recommend this if you like thrillers, and if you are on the fence, go see it. It's not great, but if you go in not expecting much, it's pretty enjoyable.The first thing that really stands out is the set design. Each of the rooms has its own distinctive style, filled up with small objects that make the rooms feel more realistic, but not too crowded. They feel like real escape rooms, and each room was thought out as to how they would affect a certain character and their thoughts. The characters were also fine, the movie did just the right amount of backstory, providing enough information so we know the characters and some of their backstories, but not too much so the thrills don't get bogged down by an overload of emotions. The actors themselves do an okay job, the standouts being Deborah Ann Woll and Logan Miller. The only really bad performance was Nik Dodani, but it was obvious that no thought was really put into the character, because he was just a throwaway. The deaths in the movie were also good, because there wasn't much of a focus on the gore (to keep the PG-13 rating) but it actually works out, so the movie doesn't really slow down at any point to show bleeding out characters, or have long emotional scenes. There is really only one sentimental death, but it also doesnt stay too long on that. The brisk pace of the movie keeps everything going, never stopping, so it stays entertaining. That alone is probably the best part of the movie, it never loses it entertainment value. It's fun to watch characters solve their way through the rooms, just narrowly escaping death. Even though the characters are very one dimensional, you still root for them. The last great thing about this movie is that it knows what it is. It doesn't try to be a super sophisticated twisty thriller. There were so many opportunities for it to have huge twists, but it ignored those, and just kept moving along. That made the movie a lot easier to enjoy.The movie does falter though, and it does especially during the third act. There are huge plot holes that leave so many questions, and that aspect was really frustrating. It became unrealistic at one point, and there were just lazy excuses made to cover it up. This all happened toward the end, which factors into the ending. I personally don't think that the ending was as terrible as everyone says, but it still wasn't very good. It spent the final minutes setting up for a sequel, instead of creating a satisfying conclusion. It just branches farther and farther out, making a million different possibilities for sequels and franchises. Even though the ending was bad, I'd go pay to see the sequelOverall, I'd definitely recommend Escape Room. It's isn't great, but it is better then most January movies, and if you like horror movies or thrillers, go see this. If you go into it with no expectations whatsoever, you'll probably come out pleasantly surprised.",Escape Room

This movie might feel like a fresh new take, but sadly it proves not to be. Its just another Saw, Cube or any other ""escape"" horror film.
In my opinion, Hollywood hasnt come up with something fresh in this genre since the first Saw.
Oh well, about the movie... Nothing surprising here, we got a group of characters with different backgrounds and experiences, some secrets will be revealed, some will die, some we will think have died, and someone will off course sacrifice themselfs, the bad guy will appear and have a lengthy explaination to why all this and that and.. yeah, youve seen it before.But, if you dont give a crap, Ill bet you like it.",Escape Room

And the ""secret room"" can make the rhythm of the plot very compact, and it can make people feel the time is tight and race against time in the event of a crisis.2. coincides with ""The saw"", the hero of the film has more or less dark side or shortcomings, and the background of the characters is also from all walks of life. No one character makes people shine.3. The biggest attraction of the film is in the first three secret rooms. Although the characters in the plot show selfishness, the first three secret rooms are more about the solidarity of the characters. As it shows people's optimistic and positive response to the crisis, it once feels that these characters will end up quite well.4. Because the design of the first three secret rooms is excellent, the performance of the male and female protagonists is not bright, until the end of the film, no one feels that they are the protagonists of the film. And after the secret room puzzles and plots are all in line with the rules, people have nothing to look forward to.",Escape Room
488,ericlassiterthesecond,"Thrilling, Intriguing Situations but Bad Ending and Unoriginal Situation.",6,4 June 2019,"I liked this movie when I first watched it as the situations kept me on the edge of my seat. First off, the opening scene is absolutely unnecessary as it shows a scene that happens later in the movie. The characters each have interesting backstories revealed later in the film and they all have distinct traits to distinguish the characters. I particularly liked Zoey who had the brains and was able to solve the clues to the situations. I also liked the character Jason who had a tragic backstory revealed later in the film as such a big twist for his character. The movie comes off though as a kid-friendly knock-off Of Saw as all the situations are people trapped in a room just without gore or saws. The situations though kept me interested in the film and they all left me asking what's the next room they were going to. There's way too many endings in the film as one ending is where the police are investigating the Escape Room but don't find any proof, another is where other people get stuck in the Escape Room and the final one is a mystery for who runs the company Minos Escape Room's. The endings are all intriguing and I thought they were great directions to go but they had too many endings. This was an intriguing storyline but it ends up overwrought and unoriginal,",Escape Room

It has no identity it's just so safe. Even bad ones you know Saw film when you see one. But this one just holds back sooo much. First two acts are just Pg-13 Saw and then 3rd act gives such bad answers. On the positive side production design and rooms were well done. I gotta get credit where credit is due. Rooms by themselves were kinda fun. It's decently shot and better than most low budget thrillers. Some actors were fine (not all of them). 8 pool room sequence was really cool. That's it. Film takes itself way too seriously and it just doesn't want to have fun. If it was more self aware and tongue-in cheek it could've work. Characters were unlikeable and awful. They didn't get developed and on top of that most of them are just bad. And nerd character was so annoying. They were very stupid in their decisions too. Because of them puzzles weren't as tense and egaging as they need to be. Pacing is not good as well. First 2 puzzles just took so much of time and then other rooms were incredibly rushed. Acting was wooden. Thank God main actress went on to Waves because this is... Last 30 minutes give answers. Answers are not explained all the way because of the intrigue (I mean sequels) but answers that they do give were nonsensical and just confusing. Like who are this guy who just watches people die? How can they erase whole rooms? How can they make room on the fricking plane?! Holes were so big.

The whole idea is based on the immersive escape room games getting popular nowadays.The movie starts off introducing each of the pivotal characters who happens to be part of this game where they are all trapped in the same room. The idea is to uncover clues hidden in the room and find their escape in order to proceed with the game. The director takes time introducing each of the characters before they finally get on with the game. The game puts them in life or death situations as they move from room to room. The room designs were pretty good especially the first oven room and the upside down bar room. The performances were alright and there is nothing much memorable in that area. The acting of war veteran Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll - True Blood fame), grocery store guy Ben and the truck driver Mike stood out and it must be said that the protagonist character Zoey didn't have much to do. The audience were left hanging in the end and they just set up the premise for a sequel. The last scene felt so out of the place that it seemed more like the director (or studio?) were trying to force a sequel out of nowhere.I would say, it was neither as sci-fi'sh as Cube, nor was it gritty like Saw. It was a much more toned down mashup of both of these movies with better production values.

517,fduncan-97411,Absolutely rubbish.,3,3 January 2021,"Oh my this film is categorically abysmal. Where do I even begin. My family and I sat down to watch this film after a list minute switch from good Will hunting to escape room, much to my displease before the film had even started. Unsurprisingly that thought process worsened creating a larger discontent towards it on my part. Right at the very beginning you are introduced to a clumsy and seemingly hopeless character who stumbles around one of the rooms recklessly moving around. He makes a rash decision by preemptively trying to find a four digit code starting with the number 1. The walls start to close in and OH NO HE'S IN DANGER. But it is absolutely impossible to feel that way because the camera work is so horrendous. The constant swiveling movements just lose the focus of the audience in the first scene because you become disinterested due to the flailing camera work. Simply terrible. But what entirely sums up the film in one scene is the meeting room scene. This scene is... pathetic. The lazy stereotypes of every single character is embarrassing and encapsulated fully by the dreadful writing. Everything about this scen makes me want to rip out my own small intestine and hang myself with it. I won't go into detail about the characters since I would be here for too long. However, on a positive note - and there is underwhelmingly little here - the puzzles in the rooms make for some loose entertainment but they are unique and not overused. That's all. I hate this film, sloppy camera work, god awful writing, and terrible overused carbon copy characters used since the dawn of terrible 2013-2019 films with the same used and abused character tropes and stereotypes make for an overall awful experience. Don't waste your time.",Escape Room

That's not a bad thing though! I think this film will get a WIDE variety of reviews based on the person. It will not be a dud or a blockbuster but fall somewhere in the middle based on the viewer. It was smart but very predictable from beginning to end. I enjoyed the tension that was built although I knew what was coming. The sets were well done. By and large the acting was good, some better than others. The director, cinematographer, and editor all did wonderfully. My family and I enjoyed it. It was fun, worth the night out, and the second mortgage I took out to afford popcorn, chocolate, and drinks at the theater. If you enjoy these type films then by all means go! You will enjoy it.

Ironicly the people that put them in the room only actually kill 1 of them they rest kill each other until there is only 1 guy and 1 room

If you can accept the kind of film this is and it's cliche characters spouting often clunky dialogue, it's pretty enjoyable; despite that it's about ten to fifteen minutes too long. In fact, once everyone assembles in the first escape room and the plot gets going and the danger kicks in, it can be quite tense. The first three rooms are fun but the novelty starts to wear off along with patience for the story and some of it's characters as the movie drags on.

It should cause different sensations but it doesn't, really. Mostly a rush feeling through the entire movie. Fitting for the subject. The characters tend to scream alot, not always as convincing. Some plots are unexpected to my liking. I believe the main plot; it's based on a statistic. The story is about lucky survivors of accidents, in one room, escaping death, is not groundbroaking. The characters knew as much as the viewer did. The plots are based on riddles so it is a bit dissapointing that we as viewers can not solve them before the characters can. Some were enlighted with flashbacks for an emotional charge. The special effects were great. As viewer I never felt like the camera angles were obvious or unflattering.

551,londonkingsley,A decent psychological thriller to start off 2019 well.,6,5 January 2019,"Finally, a good January horror flick? Well, we aren't to the good stage yet, but we're learning. This psychological thriller movie directed by Adam Robitel is a pretty solid entry in this genre, and by that it means it is the other entries.Nothing really new that we're seeing, but it's effectiveness is worth noticing. It has amazing set pieces and photography, but lacks in some other places, most importantly actors. There were some good ones, like Deborah Ann Woll and Logan Miller, but that's about it.Escape Room's best trait is it's suspense, and it's most surprising. I wasn't expecting this PG-13 Cube rip-off to be so unique and tense with its ""traps"". Not to spoil anything, but a specific scene involving an upside down room leads to an incredibly tense moment that literally had me on the edge of my seat. Well played, movie. It does show that the people who made this movie did kinda care.Now let's talk about this movies by far worst trait: The ending. The 3rd act of this movie is atrocious. Basically, the movie seems like it tries to ruin everything you just Saw in the good parts, the 2nd act. It does make up from it, but if the movie ended at least a bit better, or sooner, maybe it could be saved from that embarrassment.
Overall, a fun movie that provides some good thrills and interesting, new takes on the little sub genre. It doesn't provide all too much, but it does provide.6/10",Escape Room

Their backstories were incredibly silly/cheesy.
The flash forward at the start served no purpose, did they think it would add suspense? It didn't, just made the movie (which is supposed to be a thriller) more predictable.
Predictable is the opposite of thrilling.
The puzzles were silly as well (if you'd call them that), they tried to make it interesting by involving the backstories into the puzzles, but ultimately they failed miserably as the backstories were dumb anyway.
Overall I'd say it's watchable, but definitely not good.

In TCITW, the strangers were chosen to die in creative ways in order to be a sacrifice to the gods below earth, in this movie, they were chosen to die in creative ways for rich people to bet on as sport. The plus side to this movie is that the escape room challenges were actually creative and kept me on the edge of my seat. The acting in this movie could have been a lot better.

The set design was by far one of the best parts of the movie, how one minute they can be in a freezing cold ice room to being in an upside down pool bar, it was really incredible to see how much detail went into each room.
The character development was another great part of the movie. Unlike other horrors there was actually a reason for these six strangers to be chosen and in my opinion a pretty good reason. The acting from all six of the actors was amazing I really felt for these characters in the 1hr and 39mins that it was on for.

The plot was lame and I didn't give a damn about it even a little. Like in the first scene they show the character that makes it to the last room which spoils part of the movie, but this doesn't stop it from being suspenseful.
I had never seen anything directed by Adam Robitel before and he hasn't directed much but I think that the direction and cinematography is what made this movie good. There was a fine script and very good acting (for the most part) but I don't think that they could've been near as good with bland and uninspired direction.
Again, the main draw of this movie is the suspense and interesting cinematography, the acting is good and everything else is fine.

I'm sure Peter Dukes (the director) would love to direct the bowling ball film too! Also please re-hire Taylor Russell. It was so obvious she blew someone for the role! But Escape Room doesn't count as a real role. They still owe her a role to ruin with her own lack of skill!",Escape Room

The set was definitely quite impressive and made for an epic and grand atmosphere. The puzzles were unique and raised my heartbeat quite sometime, like a good horror/thriller is supposed to do.Having said that, the Escape Room does have its fair share of plot holes. It also relies heavily on other classic horror movies like Saw and Cabin in the Woods. That's understandable and doesn't bother me most of the time, but there is a scene at very end of the movie that feels kind of ripped of from Saw, in a way that was very obvious. They could've found another more creative way to deal with that.The acting is okay, but not great. The actors did a reasonable job and they certainly do not annoy in a way that bad acting could. When I think back to the movie, I don't think anyone of the cast stands out in particular.

662,nick_papadai,"Boring,bland,mediocre performances at best",1,10 January 2019,"This was supposed to be a mystery thriller. I guess like the series Saw or The Cube/ The exam. It is about some guys that are invited ""randomly"" to an escape room and they try to figure the way out and the reasons behind it. The story is very predictable which is sad to say the least, the acting is pretty bad as well and I'm not saying this from an elitist viewpoint because the actors aren't A tier, it's very below average. The viewer can't really search for clues in the movie which is kinda disappointing as well.There is a twist somewhere but it isn't worth the time. If you are like me and expect a Saw tier movie or actual mystery thriller, you will get very very disappointed from this. As a big fan of the genre, I had to see it but I wish I hadnt",Escape Room

So any review I give has to be in the context of that. That being said - this was a great film. Reviewers have compared it to cube crossed with the final destination and I don't disagree. It has an element of sadism and 'what the hell - why is this happening', which is reminiscent of Cube, but the visuals, effects, and larger than life plot events are closer to the final destination series. However it is a shade more plausible than the final destination series and gives a little more why backstory than the cube universe. The ending left me feeling a bit mixed. Not sure whether I found it entirely satisfying. However - i'd recommend it to anyone. If there is ever a sequel, i'd happily watch it.",Escape Room
670,qingyuehuaying,It is a good metaphor rather than a thriller!,9,21 January 2019,"I like this film a lot. In some way, I view it as a metaphor of the world rather than a simple thrilling film.Zoey may be the key to understand what the director want to tell us. She is a student whose profession is quantum mechanics, and the theory that ""observation would change the situation of the quantum"" is a crucial clue which appears in the beginning of the film and be repeated later by Zoey when they are stuck in the hospital ward. It is obvious that Zoey is enlightened and inspired by the theory to smash the surveillance cameras and try to find another way to get out rather than obediently following the rules made by the game designer. Undoubtedly, it is exactly the pivotal point which would save Zoey and Ben at last. Zoey's discovery is fantastic: ""We can't follow their rules."" It sounds familiar to me and remind me of almost the same line in the famous film ""Back To The Future Part III"", in which the young guy Marty arrives at the western United States as a time traveler, then unexpectedly evolved in a personal duel with a villain and spares from it because of being enlightened by his great-great-grandfather who told him not to follow that villain's rule.Apparently, as the same as Marty, Zoey's decision is right. Her realization is significant. She refuses to follow other's rules under other's eyes--it looks like a metaphor of awakening of human being. Actually, Every great achievement, every amazing progress, either in the history of evolution or civilization of human, contains exactly the same topic: breaking the status quo, overthrowing the existing order, searching for freedom and independent. As the science told us, our brain was initially set for survival, however, our ancients did not take this for granted and stayed put, we have successfully turned this original set upside down, we have redefined our brain by thinking and have been exploring almost everything in the world by using this power, we have even degraded survival to the second-level, which used to be the primary purpose of evolution. That was the first big moment of us to try to seize back some freedom and independent from the previous absolute control of our God. After that, we have been continuously fighting against the unreasonable social system, the repeated emergence of authoritarian, the religious oppression and so on, for several centuries.In some aspects, Zoey is a symbol of who has been struggling to break any kind of containment and manipulation. She is a symbol of who can think and act on their own. On the contrast, other five guys in this film are the passive ones who accept and attach to the rules without a single question. They share the same essence of compliance, although they differ from morality, volition and personality, whatever they did are exactly within the bounds of the game designer.What a pity! It is both a warning and encouragement to all of us, especially to the people whose country hasn't accomplished the democratization process.",Escape Room

The storyline was explained clearly and neatly. The actors were played well to their own characters to build the movie more interesting. The effects like CGI and sound were delivered perfectly. We can pick the moral value from this movie too.

The education value was where each person had to figure out each room and learn to work together or work against each other, that always didn't work. By taking a bad moment in each persons life and putting them all together to make different escape rooms is a good way to pull all the characters together, this would the literary value of the film. Putting a part of each persons life in a room, especially with all the little details makes it seen like you were actually in that moment, this makes for a grate artistic value. overall I really enjoyed this film.",Escape Room

I have to say it was an enjoyable watching experience and not actually THAT bad. However the writing? Wow. It was bad enough that I couldn't fully immerse myself in the movie cause I kept thinking ""who would say that?"" ""Why would anyone say that?"" ""If someone said that to me while I was about to die I'd kill them first."". Some parts were so ridiculous I laughed at them. I think it's a great concept and a good cast but bad execution.",Escape Room
686,eliasjpskogdal,Not really a thriller movie,3,27 December 2019,"This movie got the genre totally wrong. It takes 6 characters, all from different walks of life, and gives them a cube that they need to solve. This is probably the most interesting part of the movie as you see them all use different strategies to solve the cube. Some use their wits, one just watches videos on how to solve the cube, and the ""dumb"" guy tries using force to open it. Now if the movie were to build on these personalities, this movie could've been something great, but as you've probably guessed, most of these traits gets thrown out of the window. The one watching videos on how to do things never uses internet or any kind of technology ever again in the movie, and the guy using brute force actually thinks rather than just using brute force, so already the personalities of these characters are falling apart.Other than what I've already written before, there aren't much of characterization of the protagonists and you have no idea who they are. This is a good thing in most thrillers as it sets the scene for the protagonist or protagonists to explore their past while the plot starts to churn. In this movie however, it is doing it a disservice, the reason being that the plot barely has any time before danger is introduced. This is mostly because the movie is rushing getting to the escape room part of the movie, rather than letting the audience get to know the characters more. Why is this a disservice, then? Because you don't have any kind of knowledge or connection, or anything in the way of emotion for any of the characters, you don't really feel the thrill of the ride, because you don't actually care if any of the characters die.We're now moving more into spoiler territory, so if you don't want spoilers, don't keep reading!Throughout the movie we get some background to these characters and why they were chosen for the escape room, however the way it is executed is the laziest and dumbest way possible. The first person we get some background on is the war veteran who gets a PTSD trigger during the first room because she has to climb through a duct away from a super heated room, because it reminds her of the one time a vehicle she was in flipped as a result of them driving over a land mine, and she was the sole survivor. This is probably the only background reveal I actually like, because it's realistic. Then afterwards, one of the most stupid things happens, the guy who apparently have done loads of escape rooms before thinks that there isn't any real danger and that everything was staged so that they never would get hurt. Why is the one with the most experience in escape rooms the only one who sees nothing wrong with the different rooms?! He should be the one to first notice that there's something off! They even try to get a hint in the room which, I think, all normal escape rooms give, as clearly stated by the character himself just moments before stating that there's nothing wrong. Anyways, him denying everything is of course a death sentence in disguise, and you can guess who the first person to die is. Now I don't really remember if there were any background given to the escape room maniac, but if there were, it couldn't be that memorable if I can't remember it.Now the rest of the background reveals are pretty stupid, they are mostly triggered by different traps, but they mostly don't help them in any sort of way. Prime example is in the cold room, where the business guy had experience with hypothermia because he had been on a sinking boat with a friend. He explains that when you get hypothermia you become disoriented and aggressive, which is shown in a flashback of the boat sinking just afterwards, but how is him explaining it going to help anyone? If they get hypothermia they can't do anything different than what they're already doing! Of course when they finally solves the room the guy with experience with hypothermia gets hypothermia, which is okay until you realize that he has the key to the next room and is disoriented, but apparently he doesn't become aggressive for some reason, and actually manages to get to the door he needs to open despite being disoriented. Nothing else comes of the hypothermia. It serves no plot purpose other than trying to give a little bit of suspense to a character I don't care about, because the only thing I know about him is that he is a business person, and that he had hypothermia while sinking in a boat, and at that same boat his friend, who I also have no reason to care about, died.Then the biggest sin of the movie emerges. They unlock the door, run into the next room, and now they're all totally fine. No after effects of the cold and hypothermia whatsoever. The only thing that actually sticks from that room was that the escape room maniac died in it. In this room the room is actually upside down, and the roof, which is the floor for them, is collapsing every time the obnoxiously loud music stops playing. They do some wall climbing and, barabim baraboom, the war veteran fell out of the room. But not before having the stupidest suspense, both literally and figuratively. She literally hangs onto a phone cord which is connected to, apparently, the most sturdy phone in existence. This phone has to have been made by old school Nokia, as she hangs onto that phone and falls, not because the phone breaks or anything under her weight, but because she loses her grip on it after dangling there for about half a minute, while the others scream at her to grab their hand.The rest of the flashback reveals aren't really worth talking about except that the nerdy girl's parents died in a plane crash when she was little, and of course she was on the plane as the sole survivor and escaped unscathed. Now in the plot they start to figure out that they all were in a situation where they all were lone survivors, and that might be why they got picked for the escape room. If this was the end of it, I could be happy with the plot. While it isn't a good plot, it isn't really bad either, but then one of them get to the game master's room and he explained that the reason they got picked was because they killed someone they had some kind of friendly connection to, which fits for the last survivor, the ""dumb"" guy, and the guy who died last. The ""dumb"" guy had been drinking and driving with his friends and caused an accident which he was responsible for and the business guy who died last hadn't been the sole survivor by luck on that boat, but had actually drowned his friend, which is kind of a ""good plot twist, I guess? But then what about the nerdy girl? How could she be responsible for the plane crash? And was the war veteran responsible for driving on the land mine? None of these questions get answered by the movie. Then the game master tries to kill the last survivor, except he wasn't the last survivor, because the nerdy girl survived by a means that wasn't built up at all, and shouldn't have been possible by the last thing we see of her. She distracts him from killing the ""last"" survivor and together they kill the game master.They then actually does something smart and goes to the police, but oh no! The bad guys somehow removed everything from the building before the police arrived and they think that the nerdy girl is crazy, which she obviously is as well, as she is seeing things. The movie then tries to set up a sequel in the stupidest way possible. The two survivors of the escape room finds out where the bad guys have their main base by some coordinates she found on their emblem and they decide they want revenge for some reason. It then cuts to the bad guys' base where one of the employees talks to the supreme bad guy via a video call, but his image is only a silhouette and his voice has gone through something that sounds like a Skype voice distorter, which looks and sounds something taken straight out of inspector gadget rather than something in a thriller.All in all this movie is laughably bad and probably fits best being watched drunk rather than for a pleasure viewing.",Escape Room

The story tells us about six strangers led to what appears to be an innocent game, but it can be their possible death. The purpose is either to fight for their life or outsmart the Escape room.I couldn't take my eyes of the TV. The plot was really catchy and the cast was the perfect fit. One of the most impressive things about the scenario was how each room was built on the character,s past trauma or defects. Another thing I really liked were the special effects.

It's a wonderful and fun film for what its worth, i mean you surely did not a expect a Oscar tier film going in to it did you? If you did, that's on you..Much better than the second one imo, better acting, better characters and overall just more fun.

Screenwriter was in toilet for a long time, and all his ideas come from there. This is obvious by a lot of references in a movie.

735,citrine1129,Absolutely brilliant!,9,6 January 2019,"Granted movies like this have been done before- saw, a past escape room, etc, but this movie was absolutely brilliant. The characters never did anything wrong (except 1), unlike in SAW, when they all did something wrong or hated life. Instead, these characters are brought together by unfortunate tragedies that led them to have to fight for survival. The characters are not the stereotypical ""blonde, stoner, virgin, smart guy, and buff guy."" They are all unique and the female leads are so powerful. One served in Iraq and the other is African American studying Quantam Physics. There is also the super smart guy who has played escape rooms many times before. More than one incredibly smart person who is also a virgin. Most of the movie is completely unpredictable and has you on the edge of your seat for most of it. It is so brilliantly played out and has numerous twists and turns I never saw coming. Most horror movies nowadays are predictable or based on jump scares, but this one was completely psychological and made you really feel for the characters. 9/10 beautifully made, coolest horror movie I have seen in a very long time!",Escape Room

Each character had a interesting backstory, That relates to each room in a small and specific way. Can't wait for the next film to be made! But of course their are down sides in the movie. The first problem would be the acting in the film just didn't feel natural and the fear wasn't real. Futhermore the film had a couple of holes that needs to be explained, (hopefully the next film will show how) for example when zoey heads back to the building where the escape room takes place and suddenly all the technology is gone. So their explanation is that they were hallucinating? The final problem of the film would be that it's plot twist/unpredictable scenes. Everyone in the theater knew that zoey was the main hero of the film and she wouldn't die in the escape room. So overall it's not a great film or a bad film, it kept me entertained, and really caught my attention. Even thought it's like the movie cube and saw series.",Escape Room

793,samglennblueeyes,Escape Room won't have you trying to escape the theater,8,15 January 2019,"Escape Rooms have grown in popularity recently with companies using the challenges as ways to build team working skills and helping the employees think outside the box. The popularity isn't just with companies though, Escape Rooms have become popular as family activities or even ways to meet new people. Escape Room has taken this craze and put it into Pg-13 thriller/horror movie. Escape Room takes the fun and excitement of these rooms and put a sadistic twist on them making it a can't look away movie where you feel like you are trying to solve the puzzles and are in the rooms yourself.
Written by Adam Robitel Escape Room is a movie about a group of 6 individuals who are all invited to participate in an Escape Room for a chance to win ten thousand dollars. All six contestants were invited by a loved one to participate by receiving a puzzle box where once they opened it the invitation was revealed. The strangers are Zoey (Taylor Russell) a genius college student, Ben (Logan Miller) an alcoholic who doesn't try in his life, Amanda (Deborah Ann Woll) a veteran, Mike (Tyler Labine) a truck driver, Jason (Jay Ellis) a successful stock investor, and Danny (Nik Dodani) an escape room fanboy. The six seemingly unrelated strangers meet in the very first escape room, although they believe they are waiting for a "" Game master"" to come in and explain everything to them. As the movie progresses we learn that every room is tied to a participant in a way to trigger their memories of an awful, life changing event in their past. I don't think I can say anymore about the connections without spoiling it, you'll just have to see it for yourself.
The rooms are very well thought out and you can tell how much detail was put into them, the director Adam Robitel tried his best to make the rooms worthwhile and knew this when he created them. The rooms make you feel like you are in the position of the actors, trying to escape the rooms yourself. The actors in the movie do such a wonderful job making you feel their pain and the thrill that they are feeling.
Deborah Ann Woll out performs herself in this film, during her flashbacks and ptsd you can feel what she has been through and when she is faced with decisions you feel like you are in her shoes faced with the same choices. Her performance reminds me of Heath Ledger's performance in The Dark Night as the joker, how he was able to fully embrace the roll and allow the audience to feel as if he was the Joker, a true villain. Although I love this movie and think Robitel did a wonderful job with his creation, the movie starts out a little slow and then feels very rushed at the end. For the start of the movie Robitel focuses too much on the participants receiving the boxes from the people in their life, where they could have spent more time in the rooms with maybe more rooms to escape.
Adam Robitel film Escape Room isn't like his other creations Insidious or Paranormal Activity but that's because it isn't supposed to be, Robitel tried to create a different type of movie and I think he succeeded with flying colors. Although Robitel could have managed the time in the movie a little differently.

796,nrifqi,Review escape room.,6,30 January 2019,"This movie is perfect for the kind of people that like the movies where people are placed somewhere and have to work together. Where there is someone who wants to save everyone and then the guy who says leave them behind, survival of the fittest. And then you have the neutral guy that just wants to get out and eventually teams up with the good guy. Also some of the effects for one scene were goofy as hell. The movie ends on a cliff hanger just so they can try to convince executives to make a second one, but the way it ends doesn't really make sense for the characters. One person that survives says we need to get the people that did this to us, and the guy she is talking to says no I can't do that. Then she says I already have plane tickets the guy is just like OK. Didn't make sense for his character to just change his mind that fast.",Escape Room
797,bryantorellana,Brilliant Film,9,31 January 2019,"My Fiancé & I Watched Escape Room & On My Behalf This Movie Was Brilliant. I Really Enjoyed The Whole Concept of this movie, it gave me a Saw Vibe In A Way. Another Thing I enjoyed about this movie is the characters and how each one isn't just your stereotypical characters you get in a film, they all have went through their own battles in life that brought them together to overcome each obstacle together in order to escape. Overall I highly recommend seeing this film if you have not yet it's a breathtaking movie & will leave you wanting to go escape an escape room haha",Escape Room

799,k-31157,A good detective movie,8,4 February 2019,"This is a good movie for the rooms. All the story are talking about puzzles and one by one just like limitless novels. The first to forth stories were traditional tailing style, but the final one was out of control, people want to find another ending. The plane simulation is really cool.",Escape Room
