0,TheLittleSongbird,I didn't think it was that bad actually....,6,8 January 2012,"Of the four films of M Night Shyamalan's that are panned as bad- The Village, The Happening, Lady in the Water and The Last Airbender- I thought The Village(having just finished re-watching it yesterday and was not sure what to make of it at first) was the least bad of the four, to me the other three are as bad as they're said to be.I wasn't expecting to like it after so many uncharitable things both here and elsewhere and by how it was marketed, but I sort of did. It does look great with beautiful scenery and brooding cinematography and the score is very haunting, eerie quality about it. There are also some genuine jolts and poignancy in the first half, and The Village with a great concept does start off intriguingly.The best thing about it though is the cast. William Hurt is nuanced and intelligent and Joaquin Pheonix is wonderfully stoic, but the biggest surprise was Bryce Dallas Howard, who was fantastic and quite moving here. There were however a few disappointments, and I say this as I consider these actors the most accomplished generally of the cast. Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson are great actors but underused and Adrien Brody comes across as wasted in a rather nothing role.What let The Village down and from stopping it from being more than it had potential to be was that while M Night Shyamalan can have films where he is a master-storyteller(The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable) or where he is sloppy(2nd half of Signs, The Happening), he comes across as rather over-ambitious here. The story is so interesting at first, but the second half is let down by too many ideas, and some of them are wonderful ideas but underdeveloped.Consequently the pace becomes more drawn out, the dialogue becomes clunky and apart from Howard I found myself indifferent to the characters by the end. And to top it all, the ending is ridiculous. All in all, not that bad but has a lot wrong with it in my opinion. 6/10 Bethany Cox",The Village
1,Leofwine_draca,The beginning of Shyamalan's fall from grace,4,13 January 2013,"2004's THE VILLAGE marks the beginning of M. Night Shyamalan's fall from grace as director, following the double-whammy of THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. SIGNS was okay, but THE VILLAGE displays the kind of self-indulgence and sense of make-believe that scuppered the likes of the progressively worse LADY IN THE WATER and THE HAPPENING.Despite the novelty of the storyline (in which an Amish-style community are terrorised by monsters in the woods, but nothing is what it seems), THE VILLAGE falls flat purely because of its sense of artificiality. The performances are all mannered and stilted despite the considerable talents and experience of principle cast members (including Weaver, Hurt and Brody) and the storyline seems gradually more and more silly as it unravels.Come the end, instead of being wowed by the umpteenth twist (although I'd already guessed some of the major ones), you're left thinking: is that it? This is cinematic evidence of Shyamalan's extreme narcissism, a shame given his undeniable talent at the earlier stage of his career.",The Village
2,SnoopyStyle,great moody light horror but horribly weak ending,6,16 April 2015,"Covington is an odd isolated village. There are mysterious creatures ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" lurking in the woods. They are supposedly attracted to specific colors and the villagers wear the safe yellow when they are close to the woods. The villagers have a truce with the creatures. However suspicious animal carcasses suggest that the truce has been broken. Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to travel to other towns to get medical supplies. He is denied by the town elders and his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver). Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) is the blind daughter of the chief Elder Edward Walker (William Hurt). She is kind to village idiot Noah Percy (Adrien Brody). When Ivy and Lucius get engaged, a jealous Noah stabs Lucius. In desperation, Ivy goes out to get medicine with the help of her father.It's an interesting movie for about 2/3 of the time. It has a nice moody vibe. At time, it borders on horror. It's a really fascinating movie. I wish Bryce Dallas Howard is better at playing blind. I also wish William Hurt's character doesn't reveal so much. It deflates the movie. Her odyssey loses much of the tension. Instead of fearing some mysterious boogeymen, the audience is left with nothing more than the random falling into a hole. It tries to recover with a strange mysterious thing. I wish it stayed with the surreal turn. It would work infinitely better if William Hurt would shut up. None of it could really saved this from a truly weak ending. People really hate it when their TV show ends with these kinds of reveal. I think Shyamalan got a taste of the reaction.",The Village
3,claudio_carvalho,A Promising But Overrated Suspenseful Movie,8,2 March 2005,"In an undefined time and location, in a small isolated village leaded by the ancients, the villagers do not trespass the border of the surrounding forest and never use red color. The population have an old agreement with the weird and evil red dressed creatures called ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" in this regard. When the crazy Noah Percy (Adrien Brody) hurts the brave Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), his blind fiancée Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) decides to challenge the menacing creatures, allowed by her father and leader of the community Edward Walker (William Hurt), and to go to the town to get some medicine to heal the wounds and save her beloved future husband. I heard so many good comments from friends of mine about ""The Village"" that my expectations of watching an excellent movie were the higher possible. Indeed, the creepy beginning of the story was very scary and intriguing, supported by a great photography and atmosphere. However, after 60, 70 minutes running time, the plot becomes very boring and does not work well, without any twist. Suddenly, the plot point is disclosed very early, ending the mystery and the reality is not a great surprise to a conscious viewer. I was quite disappointed with this promising but overrated suspenseful movie. The sound effects contribute for some scary moments, but in the end, the excellent cast that has great performance deserved a better conclusion for such a mysterious story. Further, it is hard to believe in such a plot in the Twenty-First Century. Maybe, if the story took place in the 60's or in the 70's, it would be more credible. It is also amazing to see how easy is to the leaders to control a frightened society! My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""A Vila"" (""The Village"")",The Village
4,classicsoncall,"""There are secrets in every corner of this village.""",7,13 April 2014,"Following the success of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"", both of which I liked a lot, M. Night Shyamalan had a bit of a clunker with ""The Village"". The trailers for the film had you hungering for a supernatural movie excursion, but the resolution of the story blew the whole thing right out of the water. Given that the Amish people live in the same state as the location for 'The Village', it's impossible to my mind for some community to live as if they're the only one on the planet. Even the Amish have contact with the outside world, while maintaining their own beliefs and traditions. The idea that the community elders would willfully keep their members from learning or even knowing anything of the outside world seemed absolutely perverse to me. So all that talk of 'those we do not speak of', the 'bad' color and magic rocks, which might have been intriguing in another venue, were simply wasted here once the truth of The Village was revealed with the death of Noah (Adrien Brody) and Ivy's (Bryce Dallas Howard) contact with the modern world. There may have been secrets in every corner of this village, but a little intellectual curiosity by any one of it's residents would have made the story unnecessary.",The Village
5,gavin6942,Not Appreciated As Much As It Should Be,7,24 September 2015,"The population of a small, isolated countryside village believe that their alliance with the mysterious creatures that inhabit the forest around them is coming to an end.As of 2015, this is probably M. Night's last good film. Which is unfortunate, because he had a pretty good run for a few years. Some people even want to be harsh on this film, which is unfair. Some either see it as a ripoff (which is possible) or lacking the twist they want. If it is a ripoff, that has no bearing on the film. And the twist? That is an audience expectation... whether it meets your needs or not is on you, not the creators.One thing that did not go well for the film was its marketing, which seemed to present it as a horror film. Some scenes have horror elements, and the score has some horror inspiration. But it really is not that, so much as it is a love story. Sure, it has fantasy elements mixed in, but those are secondary.",The Village
6,jboothmillard,The Village,2,6 January 2008,"""I've seen this movie, it's rubbish! The big twist at the end is, they all live in the present"" is what The Annoying Devil in Channel 4's Balls of Steel said about this film, maybe I should have listened to him, because it is pretty random, and boring. Basically there is an isolated 19th Century village surrounded by woods, the village people have seen creatures dressed in red hooded cloaks (like Jedis), so they are afraid to go in the woods, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) is injured (I can't remember how), and the pretty blind Ivy Walker (Spider-Man 3's Bryce Dallas Howard) goes into the woods to find medicine, and this is how we the audience find out that they are living in the present day. They must have been bloody scared by those creatures to stay in that village and not go out for a whole Century. Also starring Adrien Brody as Noah Percy (is he supposed to be handicapped, or is he just an idiot?), Lost in Space's William Hurt as Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Alice Hunt, 28 Days Later's Brendan Gleeson as August Nicholson, Cherry Jones as Mrs. Clack, Jayne Atkinson as Mrs. Tabitha Walker and Judy Greer as Kitty Walker. I'd rather watch the spoof done in Scary Movie 4 than this again, only that ending sticks out in my mind, director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) has let himself down. This is purely from the fact that it bored the pants off me, didn't have enough (pretty much any) great thrills or jumps, and it isn't a real horror film. Pretty poor!",The Village
7,Tweekums,Atmospheric drama,7,23 May 2009,"I'd heard some fairly mixed reviews for The Village but decided to give it a go when it was on television as I'd enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's earlier film The Sixth Sense. While I didn't think it was as good as that film it was still fairly good.Set in what appears to be a nineteenth century village the locals live in fear of the strange creatures that live in the surrounding woods, this fear is so great that none of the younger generation have ventured through the woods to the towns they know are beyond them. Since the village elders have had bad experiences in the towns the younger villages aren't that keen to risk going through to woods to go to them any way. This changes when Lucius asks permission to venture through the woods to get medicine from the town that he thinks may help his friend Noah who has learning difficulties. While he isn't given permission to go, Ivy the blind girl who loves him, has to make the journey when Lucius's life is in danger.I've tried to avoid as many spoilers as possible as hinting at plot twists could spoil the film. I suspected the final twist fairly early in the film but right up until the reveal I wasn't certain about it so it still worked. The acting was good, especially Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy and William Hurt as her father Edward Walker. While there are a few scares and there is a fairly creepy atmosphere there is very little gore and no offensive language so it is suitable for most ages. If this is on television it is worth watching and perhaps worth picking up on DVD if you spot it in the bargain section; I've only seen it once but suspect it would be enjoyable even when one knows how it ends.",The Village
8,ma-cortes,"Strange and eerie storytelling about an isolated , quiet village in Pennsylvania stalked by mysterious creatures",7,18 February 2020,"'The Village' . At first glance, this village seems happy , but this close-knit community lives with the frightening knowledge that creatures reside in the surrounding forests .At night , animals are mysteriously killed and when one man dares to enters the woods , a retaliatory attack sends the astonishing villagers fleeing to their basements . The evil and foreboding force is so unnerving that none dare venture beyond the borders of the village and into the woods. The villagers live simply under the strict leading of a group of veteran people (William Hurt , Sigourney Weaver , Brendan Gleeson , Cherry Jones ,Celia Weston) who forbid them to venture into the neighbouring woods . They talk in fear of those we don't speak of : creatures lurking among the trees ever ready to attack . But when curious, obstinate Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) plans to step beyond the boundaries of the town and into the unknown, his bold move threatens to forever change the future of the village. Their Days Of Peace Are Over . The truce is ending. I: Let the bad color not be seen. It attracts them. II: Never enter the woods. That is where they wait. III: Heed the warning bell, for they are coming.This eerie and mysterious movie depicts the tale of an isolated town confronting the surprising truth that lies just outside its borders , they live under the control of a few elders until a revelatory twist at the end . M. Night toys with political ideas , but at times , he buries them under an illogical and rather unpredictable tale . Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan got a good feel for the time period, in fact there were nearly 300 people in the scenic and construction department in order to achieve nice settings. Focusing here is on security , self-preservation , frightening to society and conservatism , all key post-9/11 themes , as revealed in the tale of a remote rural community in 1890s America. Main cast and support cast are pretty good , full of young and veteran players such as : William Hurt , Sigourney Weaver , Brendan Gleeson , Cherry Jones , Cherry Jones, Celia Weston , Judy Greer , and of course , Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody . A main draw is the cast as newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard , Ron Howard's daughter , as a visionary blind girl and other young players as Jesse Eisenberg , Michael Pitt, all of them put in great performances .Well written/produced and directed by Night Shyamalan . The motion picture was well made by Night M Shyamalan , writing , producing and directing , though being some claustrophobic and slow-moving . M. Night delivers his first period piece putting the entire cast through a 19th century ""boot camp"" at a creepy retelling with several surprises and it took the crew about twelve weeks to build the set for the village. Competently produced by Night Shyamalan himself , many of his films involve pivotal roles with extraordinary abilities or events happening to them and with children always having family problems . Night Shyamalan is an expert on fantastic and Mystery films plenty of Intelligence and thought-provoking issues as proved in : ¨Signs¨ , ¨The village¨ , ¨Lady in water¨ , ¨The Incident¨ , ¨The sixth sense¨ , with exception for an extreme flop as critical as boxoffice : ¨Airbender¨. Shyalaman usually shoots in Philadelphia , this is Shyamalan favorite location . Night is an avid comic books fan , which was made in this film that along with ""Unbreakable"" , ¨Multiple¨and ""Glass"" belong to the top-notch trilogy starred by Bruce Willis , Samuel L Jackson and James McAvoy. Rating 7/10 notable . Well worth watching . Better than average .",The Village
9,moonspinner55,"Exceptionally literate psychological drama, with intricate threads interwoven in compact yet complex plot...",6,6 December 2008,"M. Night Shyamalan wrote, co-produced, and directed this deceptively simple whirlpool of deceit and consequence. This is the kind of human study (with a suspenseful undercurrent) that might have become legendary as a paperback novel, a swift read on a rainy Saturday afternoon. An isolated East Coast community in the late 1890s, apparently made up of simple farmers and their families, have made a pact with the ominous creatures who live in the forest which borders their hamlet: do not cross into their territory, do not offend the creatures with the color red, feed them raw meat for supper, and be thankful for every day they've had without upsetting Those They Dare Not Speak Of. After a backwards villager has stabbed an innocent young man on the verge of getting married, his intended (a wise but blind lass) asks permission to travel through the woods to find medicine in the neighboring town. Shyamalan always runs the risk of upsetting his own core audience by not coming up with amazing-enough answers to his own circumstances. The scenario here is fully dimensional, the narrative is absorbing and intriguing, and all the players are wonderful...yet, Shyamalan is perhaps too logical in his storytelling (and too methodical in his approach) to satisfy a thriller audience with this story (in the end, it isn't audacious enough). On the other hand--purely as a psychological study--the movie has layers of complexity that seem even deeper in retrospect, and the dialogue is so well-written and delivered it nearly doesn't matter that the scare factor is all a sham. **1/2 from ****",The Village
10,dbdumonteil,a forest... (the Cure),7,24 August 2004,"SPOILERS...Because of great movies shot these last years such as the indispensable ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999), a new film by M Night Shyamalan is always eagerly awaited. After ""Signs"" (2002), ""the Village"" was launched in 2004 and oddly, it somewhat disappoints without we know very well why. You come out of the projection with a certain bitter taste. Why?However, a spectator who would neglect the qualities that this film contains would be someone with a lack of judgment. M Night Shyamalan's making is still as sumptuous and his work is scattered with strong moments like the scene when Adrien Brody wounds Joaquin Phoenix. Moreover, the director often succeeds in making us jump. There's also a magnificent photography that reflects well the colors of the fall and it is quite easy to detect in the nocturnal sequences a careful work on the light. To go on, ""the Village"" has got two common point with Shyamalan's previous work, ""Signs"": a will to use special effects at a minimum and the fact that this village is located in the heart of a deep forest supposedly haunted really gives the impression to be ""In Camera"", just like in ""Signs"" with Mel Gibson's farm. At last, to write his screenplay, we can conclude that the director, in the first part, essentially drew from ""Witness"" (1985), a movie by Peter Weir while the second part when Bryce Dallas Howard disappears into the woods, quite obviously recalls ""the Blair Witch Project"" (1999). All these assets reveal M Night Shyamalan's will to distinguish himself very clearly from the Hollywood influence. All of this would be perfect if there weren't any faults and sadly there are some in this film.First, Shyamalan couldn't avoid one of the traps that the topic was tending: the stereotyped characters, it is the case with Adrien Brody whom we can consider the mad man of the village. Then, one of the strongest points in the previous works shot by this talented filmmaker partly lied on excellent performances from all the actors which created a sort of harmony. In ""the Village"", I must admit that the performance remains patchy: William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard manage well but Joaquin Phoenix is rather inexpressive. As for Sigourney Weaver, I read that she was so much excited by the script that she had sleepless nights but I think she has only a minor role. Furthermore, the beginning of the film is labored in the way the director lingers on the presentation of the main characters in the village which delays the beginning of the plot.Now what to say about the outcome? Like Alfred Hitchcock, M Night Shyamalan understood that in a detective film to make the suspense last, nothing must be disclosed until the end of a film, the surprise will only be bigger. Besides, he had insisted that the journalists didn't reveal the end of the story. Personally, I can't make up my mind whether the outcome is stunning or poor. In a way, it is stunning if you take care of what Hurt says at the end of the movie and so, the whole story makes sense. But it can also be considered as poor for the spectators who expected to watch a fantastic movie and it can explain why most people felt disappointment about ""the Village"". On IMDB, the popularity rating is only 6,4 out of 10.But we can opt for another interpretation. Maybe M Night Shyamalan wanted to play with the spectator and to laugh at him by leading him on wrong tracks and revealing him that the supposedly haunted forest is just a pure invention from William Hurt. Roughly, the film can be taken for a farce.You will be able, according to your mood, find the end of the movie and even the whole movie, clever or poor. One last thing, there's no denying that in spite of plenty of obvious qualities, M Night Shyamalan's works are getting less and less appealing. I can only wish this: that he recovers",The Village
11,blanche-2,odd movie from Shyamalan but has his touch nonetheless,7,7 April 2006,"I had no idea what to expect from M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village,"" since I had heard nothing but awful things about it. It wasn't awful; there was a lot good in it, as Shyamalan, unlike some, is a thoughtful filmmaker. I don't think he's the man with the problem. I think it's his audience. They go, as they did in Signs, expecting to see a scary alien movie and are disappointed. With Shymamalan, it's never what's on the surface; it's always what lies beneath. And no matter the plot, what lies beneath an M. Night Shyamalan film is spirituality and some of life's fundamental questions.The question here is: Can we really isolate ourselves from evil? A little village, bordered by a forest that contains some sort of evil creatures, is threatened when the creatures, for the first time, seem to be encroaching on the citizens' territory. When a near tragedy strikes, one of them (Bryce Dallas Howard) must go through those woods into the town - something never done.There are some scary scenes, to be sure, but Shyamalan for me is never about the scary scenes so I'm not going to object that ""The Village"" wasn't terrifying enough. What I will say is that it does not have the pacing of his other films. It is drawn out with some slow patches in which nothing happens. Atmosphere is one thing, and it has plenty of that - but when that's all there is, a little judicious editing is called for.Bryce Dallas Howard, as the blind Ivy, seems to have inherited the family acting talent - she is a real find and does a marvelous job with a large and difficult role. Joaquin Phoenix as well is very good. And then there are the actors with whom I was young - Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt - class casting for sure, and the two pros give beautiful performances. Hurt is really making a niche for himself as a character actor. Weaver is still beautiful enough to play leads if she can get cast in one. Broadway star Cherry Jones seems to be a favorite of Shyamalan's, and she is again on hand in a small role. To cast even a bit part with a double Tony award winner shows good taste.Adrien Brody has had an odd career since his Oscar win. I advise him and Halle Berry, while we're at it, to get new agents. He plays what can best be described here as the village idiot. At first, I thought the character had Tourette's syndrome - well, there was something wrong anyway, and while I suppose he was good, I agree with one of the posters. He was annoying - a manic in a sea of soft-talking, well-mannered people.Be advised - M. Night Shyamalan doesn't make horror films. Strange sometimes, surprising, spiritual, romantic. But the aliens et al are just bogeymen asking us to confront what needs to be confronted.",The Village
12,Quinoa1984,The curse of the damned legend- a film worthy of both Oscars and Razzies,4,7 August 2004,"Make no mistake, M. Night Shyamalan, the filmmaker behind The Village as well as the hits Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, has carved a niche in Hollywood that will still be relevant after his latest.  His style as a director is unmistakable, as he lays on the dread and suspense for the audience with his stories of the supernatural and citizens at the mercy of outside forces.  One problem though with Shyamalan's series of films since his monumental success with 6th Sense, is that either the audience expects a good twist or two in the third acts and Shyamalan sticks to this ideology, or he feels that he has to do it to keep the audience on edge.While it may be coarse to suggest that The Village would be more terrifying in its third act as something of an exploitation horror film, the way it turns out The Village becomes, well, sort of silly.  It's the kind of third act that tries to get the audience thinking deeper past the realm of a super-natural suspense thriller, but the logic behind it doesn't work.  To me, the screenplay is deserved of a razzie nomination.  On the other hand, at least half of the performances are better than expected by the main cast. Though some of them might seem to be over-acting (i.e. William Hurt), under-acting (Joaquin Phoenix), and only finding the balance in here and there (Adrian Brody's performance will disappoint those expecting him to astound as in The Pianist), at least one comes out with a slight breakthrough (Ron Howard's daughter Bryce, playing a blind character, with the only flaw in the performance being it's not always believable that she's blind).Shyamalan gives us these characters, some of them rather archetypal, and they all live in a Village that keeps everything hidden and darkened by the elders.  When one of them (Howard) has to leave, it leads to the climax, and the twists.  But the best side to the film, outside of the flaws in the story and acting, is the look of the film, the way the images are presented and cut together.  Even if Shyamalan doesn't have every bit of himself as he has before in the script, he does seem to have a distinct, intriguing style via the marvelous Roger Deakins and editor Christopher Tellefson.  Indeed, it was that end alone that kept me in my seat, and occasionally gave me some goose-bumps.  And yet, by the end of the film, I felt more cheated than surprised and ecstatic at what came as the finishing touch.  The Village is a mixed bag, worth checking out but not at the same time.

15,Coventry,The Village is nothing but humbug! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise,1,3 February 2005,"NO spoilers don't worry; I won't ruin the precious (!) story I surely am going to be criticized for this again, but at least I hope to reach some people M. Night Shyamalan is nothing but a phony storyteller! At first I just thought he was over-hyped and untalented but the more films he delivers, the more it becomes clear that he's actually laughing with his fans and audiences for keeping up with his lame so-called ""mystery"" tales. It wasn't my intention to watch Shyamalan's latest so quick after its releaseIn fact, after struggling my way through that dreadfully irritating ""Signs"" I took an oath never to waste time or money anymore on his films. Luckily for me, a friend wasted his money on this because, I assure you, ""The Village"" is absolutely worthless humbug. Shyamalan once made a partly successful film called ""The Sixth Sense"" using some stylish elements. Since then, he shamelessly repeats this formula and all you'll ever find in his films are an exaggerated use of ominous music and silence, a very slow tempo and a cast that is overacting in the opposite way (meaning they do their best to look depressed, unworldly and silent). Would somebody please tell the director that atmospheric aspects like these only work when you've got a story to tell? The premise of a little village inhabited by social outcasts who're terrified of the creatures living in the nearby forests is dull, ultra-thin and definitely not suited for a compelling mystery tale. And then, of course, there's the famous ""twist-near-the-end"" which pretty much has become Shyamalan's trademark. Well, the ""twist"" is this film is so ridiculous, so predictable and so pathetic that the entire project instantly turns into a comedy! Actually, I wouldn't refer to it as a twist but as a confirmation that our precious director is completely uninspired and overrated. What amazes me the most is that so many respected actors are almost battling to become part of this fake hype. Surely Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt know better than to accept awful scripts like this? Hopefully naive fans won't start shouting that opponents of The Village didn't ""get it"" and that the film actually contains several brilliant metaphors and underlying messages The only underlying message featuring here is that M. Night Shyamalan's constantly growing star-status is one giant hoax.",The Village
16,michaelRokeefe,Isolation is not meant for all.,3,6 August 2004,"This movie tries to live off the reputation of its writer/director M. Night Shymalan and is a big dose of disappointment following months and months of hype. Covington is a small town in late 1800s rural Pennsylvania. It is an Amish-like community chaste and pure of thought governed by the fear of mythical creatures that inhabit the woods that surrounds it. The daughter(Judy Greer)of the town's leader(William Hurt)proclaims her love for a young man(Joaquin Phoenix)who has the inner strength to stand up against community policy. Phoenix has no interest in Greer, but actually loves her blind sister(Bryce Dallas Howard). Phoenix wants permission to go through the woods and go into the outer cities to bring back modern medicines. Before his departure he is stabbed by the village idiot(Adrien Brody). Howard in spite of her lack of sight has the fortitude to enter the woods with intent to reach the cities and bring back needed medicines to save her young lover's life. Plenty of drama; but where is the thrills and horror implied by what seems like six months of hype. The movie drags along and you wait and wait for something to happen. If you momentarily doze off you risk missing a subtle hint of what this story is really all about. Not only is Phoenix wasted, but so is Sigourney Weaver who plays his mother. I dare say that Brody steals the show. Howard(daughter of Ron Howard)is very impressive. Also in the cast are:Celia Weston, Brendan Gleeson, Frank Collison and Fran Kranz.",The Village
17,hitchcockthelegend,A lovely shot tale that has resonance in the modern age.,8,4 March 2008,"This user comment is my own personal feelings, it is not a review that I make in the hope of turning anyone's opinion to that of my own, no mater what anyone says or does, my feelings for the film will never change.I see a smartly crafted movie about fear and hope, a community living in fear of the outside world, I see involving characters to follow with interest, I see a gorgeous setting that intrigues and engages me.Manoj Night Shyamalan's fourth mainstream picture is now, as we can all agree, a victim of a terrible marketing campaign, wasn't it? For there are horror elements in the film, of which I don't wish to spoiler write about, the horror elements are there, they just aren't the boo jump scary monster variety that many had hoped for. The ending to the film disappoints many it would seem, but it doesn't to me because it is here that the film has most resonance and the point is well and truly made. It's acted out with style from the majority of the cast, and Shyamalan directs with a steady caring approach. It's not without flaws for sure, but this is a very tidy piece that's saying quite a bit if the viewer is so inclined to jump on board.

"" Ah "" I piped up "" I know the ending of this and it's not a horror movie "" and promised not to tell anyone the twist ending . The titles came up and my sister asked who the director was as M Night Shymalan rang a bell . I explained that he was the writer/director of THE SIXTH SENSE ( Overrated ) and UNBREAKABLE ( Brilliant movie ) . About half an hour later my sister asked if anyone was still able to follow it and at this point my brother admitted he'd seen it at the cinema and it does pick up .This sums up everything that's wrong with THE VILLAGE - Imagine if you have no idea who Shymalan is and you're expecting a horror movie watching this will be a dire ordeal . It's makes a snails pace look like a speed OD in comparison . We're treated to a series of sequences that on the surface make little sense like people burying red flowers in the ground . This all might make sense after the ending is revealed but what ruins the movie - Even if you know the ending - is the editing , the scenes jar without any sort of flow and as many people have pointed out this feels like a twelve hour movie cut down to a two hour movie with a lot of important scenes cut out . For example we see an attack by the mythical creatures then there's a jump cut to the next day which is very disjointed ,it's not well into the film that it's revealed that Ivy is blind when surely it would have been obvious at the start . Little things like that leads me to believe there's been large chunks cut out of the narrative along with characters that seem to be underdeveloped . And on top of all this the director insists on shooting several scenes in slow motion as if the movie isn't already slow paced enough ! !!!! SPOILER !!!! As for the ending where it's revealed that the village is part of the 21st century and has been built by people wanting to escape the violence of modern day America it's by no means as clever as the endings of THE SIXTH SENSE or UNBREAKABLE . There's also a lack of internal logic to this . For example if the younger villagers believe they're living in the 19th Century then why do they wear 19th century clothes ? If they were wearing flares and tie dye T-Shirts they'd still believe they were living in the 19th century if that's what they've been conditioned to believe wouldn't they ? The characters also have odd sounding 19th century speech patterns . Again why would people not knowing what century it was have to speak in 19th century speech patterns ? They could easily use 21st century speech patterns which would make the dialogue easier to understand . Ah but that might make the audience cotton on to the fact that this isn't a 19th Century village after all , the whole film revolves around the twist that it's the 21st Century . As many , many people have pointed out similar ideas have been done much better in a third of the running time in THE TWILIGHT ZONE and without a doubt THE VILLAGE is Shymalan's weakest movie * Just for the record COLLATERAL was the other movie we watched that night",The Village
19,LeonLouisRicci,Another Disappointment in a String of Such Things,5,18 November 2013,"Maybe the Best that can be said is this Movie is not as Bad as the Director's other Mega-Disappointments, Lady in the Water (2006) or Signs (2002). But that Certainly isn't saying Much. So let it be Said that this Film isn't all that Persuasive in its Conceit or all that Entertaining.The Movie Looks Good and Manages to Evoke some Atmosphere, until it goes in the Woods and then it Completely Collapses into Utter Boredom and Insignificance. The Plot Plods along for almost Two Hours and then, Surprise. But Maybe Not. For most Viewers who go in for this sort of Thing (Horror/Suspense/Thrillers) the Screams of Discontent Replace the Screams of Scary Stuff.The Director Loves Movies as He has said Many Times in Many Interviews where it is Revealing that He may Love Himself even More. So His Underestimation of the Target Audience is Puzzling. His Schtick has Become Sick in its Obviousness and PretensionOverall the Film is not Awful, just Tedious and Trite. It is Overwritten and Smug and Remains a Curiosity. The Mystery is how a Director's Name can come before the Title based on a Couple of Excellent Movies. It used to be that was an Earned Honor based on a Body of Good Work.",The Village
20,poolandrews,Good film with a great twist.,6,28 November 2009,"The Village is set during the 19th Century where a small village exists in total seclusion surrounded by woods that are filled with strange monsters that the elders say will not let anyone from the village enter the woods or leave the area.Some of the younger members of the village are not totally convinced & seek permission to leave the village & travel to towns beyond the woods but the elders are insistent that they do not leave. When a blind girl named Ivy Walker (Bryca Dallas Howard) & Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) announce their intentions to marry village simpleton Noah (Adrein Brody) who has a crush on Ivy stabs Lucius forcing Ivy to leave the village in search of medicines but will the vicious monsters within the woods let her pass & what vengeance will they take on the village & those who live there...Written, produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan this was his fourth major film after the success he had with The Sixth Sense (1999), Unbreakable (2000) & Signs (2002) all of which I rather like for their horror mystery aspects & killer twist endings which has sort of become his trademark, The Village is probably the last really good film he has made & while it will undoubtedly divide audiences I did like it overall. The film is fairly slow going at times but it does build up really well with a certain sense of dread & anticipation on the part of the viewer, the twist ending is good & it's one of those ones where everything sort of falls into place nicely & everything that has gone before makes sense in context. The character's are alright if a little cold at times, the dialogue is sparse but meaningful & I felt like I was rewarded for sticking with it & following it properly. The lack of any sort of action might put some off & disappoint other's but I think if you give it a chance it's a satisfying experience. The film tries to be quite deep with the likes of fate & sticking with what you believe touched upon. However The Village is not perfect & the biggest problem I had with it was that while the ending depicts a community set-up to shun modern society & it's horrors for a more simpler & wholesome life surely creating the village's entire existence on horrible killer monsters lurking in the woods around it who may kill anyone at any point doesn't seem that great of an existence either as surely everyone would be living in constant fear?The film looks great with impressive period detail & the cold naturalistic colour scheme suits the oppressive nature of the film, there's a lack of close-ups with plenty of shots where the camera is fixed & character's are quite far away with rams home the feel of isolation even more. There's some well crafted scenes like the fist attack on the village by the monsters & the scene where Lucius is stabbed as the scene starts out to innocuously but suddenly shifts into something much darker. There's very little horror here, there's no real gore or violence either. Originally called The Woods but there was another horror film called The Woods (2006) the same year so the title of this was changed to the Village.With a supposed budget of about $70 odd million this is very well made with big budget Hollywood production values, filmed mainly in Pennsylvania in a couple of large fields where an entire town was built & then taken down again after filming had finished. The acting is very good too from a decent cast none of whom really stand out but are believable including Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt & Brendan Gleeseon while Kirsten Dunst was replaced by Bryca Dallas Howard after she dropped out to make Elizabeth town (2005).The Village is a film that may not appeal to everyone & it being advertised as a straight horror doesn't help but if you are prepared to stick with it & follow it through then it is pretty rewarding with a twist that I liked & thought worked well.",The Village
21,Boba_Fett1138,The movie promises more than it really is.,7,27 January 2005,"The main problem with ""The Village"" is the story. The beginning of the movie drags on for too long without seeming to go somewhere and the 'surprise twist' comes too early. The best part of ""The Village"" are the last 30 minutes. Funny, because it where the last 30 minutes that were the worst part of M. Night Shyamalan's previous movie ""Signs"".I think that the marketing is one thing that killed this movie. The movie was presented as a scary supernatural horror/thriller. What you got when you watch the movie is a thriller with too few real thrilling moments and a dramatic love story. Basically all the excitement in the movie was already in the trailer.Still ""The Village"" is a perfectly watchable movie mainly because of the cast. I think it's fair to say that the movie is better as an actors movie than as a thriller. Especially Adrien Brody was surprising good in his role. Bryce Dallas Howard is a good actress (although she was not really a convincing blind person) but her character is not strong enough to carry the entire final part of the movie. Joaquin Phoenix's characters disappears way too soon out of the story, the movie could have really used his character.I know that M. Night Shyamalan and Roger Deakins deliberately choose bright colors for the movie but I can't say that I'm completely happy about the visual style. A more of a foggy ""Sleepy Hollow"" kind of atmosphere would had done wonders to the movie I think. It would had certainly made it more exciting.All in all a movie that promises more than it really is and that lacks some good and realistic excitement that all other M. Night Shyamalan movies thus far had. Disappointing but most certainly not unwatchable!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Village
22,view_and_review,M. Night Shyamalan does it again,8,5 December 2006,"With M. Night Shyamalan movies I have come to expect the unexpected. The Village is no different. The movie is about a simple people who live in a simple village in the woods surrounded by ""those that they do not speak of"". They lead a life of blissful coexistence with the monsters in the woods. Their life in the village is one of innocence, purity, and morality. But their bliss is shattered when a crime is committed. Do they venture into the woods to go to the towns for medicine to save the victim, or do they stay within their protective bubble safe from the monsters?You can tell that a lot of thought and effort was put into this movie just by the way it unfolded. The movie portrayed nothing but the innocence of the people of the Village while dropping subtle hints of secrets about the people as well. The entire movie is a build up towards finding out the truth of the Village, its residents, ""those that they don't speak of"", the towns, and the secrets. M. Night Shyamalan did not disappoint, the ending was worth waiting for and it gave plenty of food for thought.",The Village
23,neil-476,"Oh, spoilery spoilery spoiler",6,30 June 2012,"I'm spoilering right from the start here, so get over it.There's this village, see, and you're supposed to think it's late 19th century - they all talk old fashioned and don't have any technology. Oh, and they are apparently isolated by Things We Don't Talk About which live in the woods, with whom they have an uneasy truce. Taciturn Lucius wants to visit the towns for medicines. He gets engaged to blind Ivy, only to be stabbed by nutjob Noah. Ivy is deputed to set off through the woods to get medicine.The big shock moment - this is M Night Shyamalan, remember - is when Ivy nearly gets run down by a truck: this is actually present day, and the isolation is because the Elders decided to keep their loved ones safe by creating this remote community. And the menacey things are to scare everyone into staying put.On the plus side, this is moderately atmospheric, has a mild sense of menace, the shock moment works fairly well the first time you see it, and there are some very good performances (notably Adrien Brody as mad idiot Noah).On the negative side, it takes an age to get moving, the shock moment doesn't stand up to repeat viewings, and one wonders too often about things like where they get the oil for lamps from.I find myself wondering if I would have made the same comments following a first viewing, and if I hadn't been exposed to the diminishing returns from Shyamalan's movies in the meantime.",The Village
24,ferguson-6,What color is your poncho?,6,19 August 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  We can always count on director M. Night Shyamalan for two things: a twist and a cameo.  Regretably, ""The Village"" has a much more interesting cameo than twist.  Similar to ""The Sixth Sense"", Night once again flashes his fetish for the color RED.  I must admit the best use of red in the movie is Bryce Dallas Howard's beautiful head of hair.  She has a very unique look, but does a wonderful job of carrying this film.  Shyamalan favorite Joaquin Phoenix (the artist formerly known as Leaf) does a decent job of playing the sensitive guy amongst a bunch of goofy self-imposed castaways.  However, this is no 3 hour tour gone awry. These idiots actually designed the village and the twist will leave you scratching your head as if to say both ""Why?"" and ""Is that it?"".  As usual, some nice camera work, but the dialogue borders on hoakey most of the time. Oscar winner Adrien Brody is downright creepy in his role and I am still not sure what to make of veterans William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.  Anyway, not much of a thriller and at times comical, though not purposefully so. Great violin work throughout.",The Village

Night Shyamalan / Cast: Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver: Underrated fourth film by director M. Night Shyamalan who created such bizarre masterpieces as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. A curse surrounds a remote village where the occupants never venture into the forest thus disturbing the creatures of the woods. When such an offense occurs red paint is slashed upon every door and small animals are found skinned and mangled. M. Night Shyamalan brings mood through atmosphere with an underlining sense of suspense through its blind heroine, played by Bryce Dallas Howard who accepts the task of crossing the dangerous territory to obtain medicine. Joaquin Phoenix also entered the forest in acceptance of the same task until fate had other plans. Adrien Brody steals scenes as a mentally handicapped who has penetrated the forest but seen as innocent. William Hurt is effective as a village authority, and Sigourney Weaver plays Phoenix's firm yet concern mother who warns him of the dangers of the forest. Stunning production aid this underrated thriller that seemed to go unappreciated by those who may not have gotten Shyamalan's twisted storytelling here.

Commendable tale about the virtue of preserving and cherishing innocence is well-made and acted, with a most thoughtful story, though it came perilously close to imploding when you consider the revelation at the end, which viewer may see coming a mile away.

27,movieman_kev,Out of time,5,23 February 2005,"The film ""The Village"" centers on well a commune really and all the people that live on said Commune as if cut off from the outside world. To say more then that would be to spoil it to much, and I wouldn't dare do that, would I? This was my second least favorite of M. Knight's movies. (It's still light years better than ""Wide Awake) The acting was good enough and I liked the actress playing the blind redhead. But the film as a whole did nothing for me and left me feeling empty. It's not a good movie, nor a bad movie, but for a director of his talent it is a rather boring movie. But I do give Shyamalan credit for doing something that I never imagined I'd do, which was sitting through an entire film with that snot-nosed idiot Adrian Brody. And to think that I'll have to see that A-hole again when Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong comes out fills me with absolute dread. Also the Village is NOT an allegory about the current political climate of the United States, however thought up that bull is way too addle-minded for the human race.My Grade: C- DVD Extras: Deconstructing the Village; Deleted scenes; Bryce's Diary; M knight's home movies; Photo gallery;Trailers for ""the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Gallaxy"", ""Ladder 49"", ""Mr. 3000"", and ""National Treasure""",The Village
28,Aaron1375,"It putters, then stutters, and then dies.",3,2 August 2004,"Congrats ""The Village"", you have replaced ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" as the lowpoint so far of the 2004 movies I have seen.  The sad part is I sort of liked that one, this one, however, I did not enjoy much at all.  In fact, I have now finally seen a movie that was worse than last years ""28 Days Later"", in fact after seeing this one I feel bad about being as hard on that movie as I was.  I give this movie a three only because at least it has good performances...still those performances cannot make up for the fact the plot was awful, it was dreadfully boring, and the ending was very predictable...I think I got it five minutes in when I saw their community resembled an amish village, and I was 100% sure once the origin of the creatures is revealed. The movie is totally devoid of humor, it takes itself seriously to a fault, and quite frankly it would not scare a child of three or four years old. The only reason it is so highly ranked here at imdb is that M. Night directed it so people feel they have to like it, but he isn't a god and so I say this movie is just a mistake by him.  Why he can not make a movie without the twist ending is beyond me.  Next time he should just make a straight horror movie with no twists at the end and that would probably surprise people more than this one did.  I mean if you did not see this one coming you probably have problems concentrating, but then who could blame you?  This movie is very tedious and if you can manage to keep awake through the whole thing you will say ""so that is it?""  You would have been better off sleeping.  There are also more holes left unfilled than can be found in a piece of swiss cheese.  It also irked me that Phoenix is basically not even in the second half of this film.  All in all a grave disappointment, a movie that looks like a made for television movie presented by the Lifetime channel.  If this scares you seek medical help.",The Village
29,Wuchakk,A Unique Film of Beauty and Mystery,7,6 April 2013,"Released in 2004, ""The Village"" is not a horror film; it's a romantic mystery. Not a 'mystery' in the sense of a murder mystery, but rather all-around mysterious. It's a ""What if...?"" tale. The set-up presents the viewer with a slew of questions, which are all answered in the final act. The fun of the film is to see if you can figure out the answers before they are revealed, but that's not the only reason to appreciate it.THE PLOT: A small village in Eastern Pennsylvania in 1897 is surrounded by foreboding woods that harbor mysterious creatures. The villagers are pretty much imprisoned in the hamlet. Something happens that prompts a young blind woman to risk a journey through the dangerous woods to find medicines in another town.Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, stars as the innocent blind protagonist while Joanquin Phoenix plays her strong-and-silent loved one. Adrien Brody is effective as the detestable village idiot. Also on hand are Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt as the town elders, who know more about the situation than they let on.Director & writer M. Night Shyamalan portrays the locations with an aura of beauty and mystery. On top of this the score is fittingly haunting and beautiful. As such, the film is a feast for the eyes and ears.There's one potent scene I must mention *** minor spoiler***: Near the end, the blind girl finally encounters a person from the outer towns. The contrast of the innocent, secluded blind girl and the outsider is well captured. The outsider questions the mysterious girl but ultimately discerns that she is genuine. This is an extraordinary scene -- ranking up there with the all-time best in cinema (much like the mysterious Native American bar sequence in ""Wolfen"").Although the end-revelation in Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"" was outstanding and arguably better than the the one in ""The Village"", I personally prefer ""The Village"" overall. Bottom Line: If you have a taste for surreal mystery and rustic beauty, don't miss out on ""The Village."" It's a moving, one-of-a-kind picture.GRADE: B+ or A- ***EXTREME SPOILER ALERT*** Do not read further if you haven't seen the film.There are two main mysteries: (1.) The nature of the creatures in the woods, and (2.) the reality of the village itself. The truth about the ""creatures"" may be discerned by some viewers before it is revealed, but, I gotta admit, my wife and I didn't figure it out (and she's good at predicting story elements). As to the second mystery: There's no way a viewer could figure this enigma out as long as s/he accepts that the story takes place in 1897, which both the film and the DVD jacket indicate. The only way you could unravel this puzzle is by considering the possibility that it does not take place in 1897. My Wife and I never considered this possibility (after all, why would they lie?) and so were unable to discern the truth.Beyond all that, the film has a potent subtext. It's an allegorical slam against socialism in general and, in particular, that humanity-destroying socialist experiment known as Sweden. Its title is a riff on Hilary Clinton's socialist polemic ""It takes a village (to raise a child)."" Shyamalan shows the deadly consequence of entrusting the care of our children to the socialist state. The movie opens with the village's burial of a young child and begins the final act with the death of a product of village upbringing: a dim-witted, craven murderer.The movie focuses on the sad fate of the young adults who manage to survive their socialist upraising while retaining a remnant of hope for a better future. The pure-hearted and intelligent Ivy is ultimately seduced by power and welcomed into the inner-circle of village leaders where she will promote the utopian lie of peace within the community and chaos outside, meanwhile continuing to bury the young and execute the useless. Her love interest, the obedient Lucius, is unfit for the inner circle but will be useful as a goon-enforcer for the village as he carries on the Elders' practice of terrorizing its own citizenry in the guise of forest monsters.As with Sweden, the village is dependant on Western capital. Its appearance of self-sufficiency is a facade. It was built with, survives on and is protected by the wealth of capitalists. This can't last forever, of course. As Margaret Thatcher put it, the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.",The Village

The guy who wrote and directed this film, I believe it is an East Indian name that I can't spell, has a bad tendency of writing films that have great previews, but disappointing endings with no conclusions.  Another film like signs.  The story dragged, and the characters were over evolved.  This would be a great short story, but not a full feature film.  The movie is plausible.

I wouldn't agree with that as The Sixth Sense was his best to me. But that's my opinion. The Village is entertaining though, like most of his movies, with the right amount of suspense. The cast is great as well, all top class actors and actresses so bad acting isn't present in this movie.

32,whpratt1,Was A Complete Surprise,7,31 October 2006,"This film kept my interest from beginning to the very end and I must say it was a big surprise how this film made an about face and went into other directions. The story starts out which looks like an Amish community in Illinois or Pennsylvania, with lots of farm land and the people dressing way back in the dark ages of time. These people were instructed to never enter the woods that surrounded their village and there were very strict rules about doing practically everything. The Village was controlled by a group of men, namely, William Hurt who had a great ability to lead the people into doing just what he wanted, like puppets on a string. Problems seem to face the village and then the dark secrets of the past come into light and a young girl has to face the bitter truth. This is an entertaining film and good for Halloween night.",The Village
33,JamesHitchcock,A haunting parable of modern life,7,21 January 2008,"The twist- a sudden, unexpected development- is a common plot device in the modern cinema, especially in thrillers. Unfortunately for scriptwriters, most of the classic twists have been so over-used that they no longer come as a surprise to the audience. It no longer seems original to reveal that, for example, the hero's girl or best friend is really in league with the villains, or that a police officer investigating a crime is in fact responsible for committing it, or that a character believed to be dead is still very much alive.Of course, the fact that a particular twist is so hackneyed as to have become a cliché does not prevent film-makers from continuing to rely upon it- ""Reindeer Games"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" are two examples of modern thrillers likely to leave audiences with a ""seen it all before"" feeling. The challenge to the really inventive scriptwriter is now to come up with as novel a twist as possible. ""The Village"" is a good example.The film is set in a rural village in Pennsylvania, situated in a valley surrounded by dense forests. At first we are led to believe that the date is 1897. It soon becomes clear that this is no ordinary village. It has the air of a religious commune, although the precise nature of the villagers' beliefs is not made clear. The community is governed by Elders, who lay down strict rules. The villagers are forbidden to set foot outside the valley. The neighbouring towns are regarded as places of sin and corruption, while the surrounding woods are the haunt of mysterious beings referred to only as ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"". For a long time we do not see these beings, and it is left unclear as to whether they are humans, or animals, or some form of supernatural entities. The colour red is forbidden because it is associated with these creatures; the favoured colour is yellow, referred to as the ""safe colour"".The plot seems a fairly simple one- as another reviewer has pointed out it resembles something from Thomas Hardy. A young man, Lucius, and a blind girl, Ivy, are in love, but their love arouses the jealousy of Noah, the village simpleton, who is in love with Ivy himself. Noah stabs Lucius in a jealous rage, seriously injuring him. The wound becomes infected, and Ivy begs the Elders to be allowed to travel into the nearest town to obtain the medicines which might save his life. They agree, reasoning that as Ivy is blind she will not be able to see the temptations of urban life and is therefore less likely to be corrupted by them.Then comes the twist. For the first time we realise that the film is set not in the 1890s but in the twenty-first century. The community has been set up by the Elders as a refuge from what they see as a crime-ridden society. (Several of them have themselves been victims of violent crime). Ivy's wealthy father Edward was the leading light in this scheme, and the man responsible for financing it. They have retreated into an imagined past, denying the members of the community the benefits not only of twentieth and twenty-first century technology, but also of many inventions (such as cars and telephones) which actually existed in 1897, the year in which the villagers believe they are living. ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" are imaginary beings, invented by the Elders to deter the younger members of the community from setting foot in the woods which separate the village from the nearest town.In this context of the film, the twist comes as an unexpected one, but, on reflection, the situation is perhaps not as bizarre or outlandish as it might appear at first sight. There are parallels between the village and real-life religious communities such as the Amish or Mennonites which forbid their members to use modern technology. The difference, of course, is that the village Elders take the principle one stage further by attempting to deceive their members about the true nature of the modern world they are rejecting, something that the real-life communities would not do. There may also be parallels with the modern phenomenon of the ""gated community"", another attempt by the select few to shut themselves away from the perceived violence of modern society. Some have even seem parallels with American foreign policy.None of the acting performances are particularly noteworthy, except possibly that from Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron) as the blind Ivy. What is, however, noteworthy is the way in which director M. Night Shyamalan is able to conjure up an atmosphere of dread and foreboding. The look of the film is based upon the works of the artist Andrew Wyeth, although Shyamalan's palette, dominated by warm yellow and orange tones, is rather richer than Wyeth's. (Much of the film was shot near the artist's home town of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania). Despite the warm colours and the beauty of the rural landscapes, however, the village always has an eerie, haunted air about it.""The Village"" is sometimes described as a horror film or as a thriller, but neither description really seems adequate, as it is a difficult film to fit neatly into any one genre. Perhaps the best description would be as a haunting parable about modern life and the dangers of nostalgia. The irony of the film is that Lucius falls victim to the violence which the Elders are trying to escape; the only difference made by their retreat into the past is that he is denied the modern medicines which might have saved his life. 7/10",The Village
34,Smells_Like_Cheese,Was I mistaken?,2,14 February 2005,"If I remember correctly, the trailer to ""The Village"" looked like a horror film. And an exciting one at that. So, I rented it, even though I found it in the drama section. I was like ""Drama? I thought it was horror. Oh, well."" This was such a boring movie. The story was very twisted and taken into a whole other place towards the end. So much could have been done with this story. I think there is a good movie in here somewhere. It can do without the drama. I'm sorry, I have just been looking for a good horror film lately. I'm slowly dying of my love for the genre. Sad, is it not? ""The Village"" did not satisfy me, and I cannot see how it would satisfy any other movie lover.

35,MovieAddict2016,Pleasantly surprised - enjoyable if predictable,8,17 February 2005,"It's a shame so many people are criticizing this film based on its ""twist."" I think Shyamalan is a good storyteller in the classic sense that he's able to just make a good atmospheric thriller that holds one's interest. Some are saying he's a rip-off of Hitchcock, but Hitchcock's films were usually a bit more realistic and almost never supernatural (perhaps ""The Birds"" is the farthest he ventured into truly fictional horror, even ""Psycho"" was realistic - if not then, certainly now).""The Village"" is a good film. I thought the performances were fine, the direction was tight and suspenseful, and the twist - although I guessed it before the film even started - was still delivered well.Another painful thing about this film is that so many people were expecting a shock-twist, when in fact the twist in ""The Village"" isn't as gimmicky as one might expect. In fact it's not much of a ""shock"" or ""twist,"" it's more of a standard minor revelation in the film, and easily predictable.It's a testament to the story itself that it is able to be entertaining in spite of this. At least I thought so.I'm not a huge fan of Shyamalan, I didn't buy into the ""Sixth Sense"" hype at first and thought it was a fairly basic supernatural thriller with a one-time twist that was easily predictable. I liked it on repeat viewings, but at first I was disappointed.I saw ""Unbreakable"" and enjoyed it, but found it fairly dull at the same time.Then I saw ""Signs"" and absolutely loved it, which is ironic because a vast number of people seem to hate the film based on the single fact that its twist is unrealistic.I don't think that's always the case. Just like with ""Signs,"" Shyamalan builds his twist into something else - it's a metaphor for a larger picture. The final message I gathered from ""The Village"" is that you can't escape tragedy and heartbreak, it follows you everywhere, and it's an element of humanity that can't be broken away from.Not a great film but a fun one-time viewing with a satisfying conclusion.",The Village
36,Rainey-Dawn,A Different Kind of Horror,8,27 June 2014,"When I saw the advertising for the movie I thought ""wow this looks pretty good"" and then it came on TV one night - I had to watch it. The movie is better than the previews had me thinking it would be. A wonderful film.The Village is not a visual hack-them-up gore-fest like Saw (for example) nor is it a ghost story, it not a creepy-kid horror film and it is not a monster movie. Instead The Village is good story - within the story lies a horror which is plausible. The movie is a group of people wanting to get away from all the bad things in mainstream modern society and go back to a simpler, more peaceful way of living - or so they thought - and that is where the horror lies... away from modernism.The entire cast was wonderful in this movie! The costumes and scenery are beautiful. And the story, the story is haunting - a must see different kind of horror film.Personal Note: I think the movie is underrated on IMDb. And it's one of my all time favorite films.8/10",The Village
37,KineticSeoul,The fall of M. Night Shyamalan,5,25 December 2010,"Now this isn't one of those movies that is uber awful like some of the reviewers are claiming it to be, but it isn't a good one either. And this is basically what started the bashing of M. Night Shyamalan, when he was praised for the most part for his past movies. He really started to push the twist thing a bit too far in a dull and negative way in this, and after finding out the twist I really wished I didn't know the twist. Even the characters in this movie is really awkward at times, but I guess it has a purpose. I really disliked the twist in this and personally I could tell what was going on a mile away, it was pretty obvious and nothing about it was really shocking or gripping. It wasn't even that suspenseful or scary at all what so ever. Overall it isn't a terrible movie, but if your looking for a good twist or suspense this one just isn't it.5.3/10",The Village
38,OllieSuave-007,The better one from Shyamalan.,8,30 March 2014,"This is one of the better movies from director M. Night Shyamalan, a story about a 19th century village whose close-knit community believes terrifying evil creatures lurk and roam the woods near their homes at night. However, courageous Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) has a curiosity that got the best of him and plans to step beyond the boundaries of the town and into the woods to find the truth behind these creatures.While known for his gloomy and dreary-looking movies with emotionless acting, Shyamalan breathed some life in this picture, providing some attention-grabbing scenes, suspense, and mystery to keep you entertained. It makes you eager to learn the truth behind the creatures and what the plot twist unfolds in this unpredictable story. The eerie sceneries makes you feel you are at the village itself, anxiously waiting to see what the dark woods hide beyond the town. The acting is pretty good, coupled with some good character development and substance, making the cast of characters believable and alive. Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt and Adrien Brody are among the cast members, each delivering some solid performances to the on-screen drama. The plot flows at a steady pace, but with the added tension and suspense, this movie is an exciting piece of work. Grade B",The Village
39,sddavis63,One Of Shyamalan's Weaker Efforts,4,26 March 2009,"I've liked a lot of M. Night Shyamalan's movies, (""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" jump to my mind immediately) but to me at least ""The Village"" didn't quite live up to expectations. The mystery supposedly hidden in this movie about this village faced with mysterious creatures living in the woods surrounding it isn't particularly well-hidden. I figured that out about half way through when I realized that one of the men was wearing a very modern-looking suit, whereas the movie sets you up to think of this as being set somewhere in the past. I realized at that point that what we were dealing with here wasn't really a horror movie; it was more of a psychological study of what was essentially cult-like behaviour: a group of people who have chosen to isolate themselves from society, and who use fear as a method of mind-control to prevent people from leaving. In that, it didn't really provide anything of earth-shaking importance - it simply painted a portrait of life in this ""village,"" and it did so with a number of problems hanging over it. To me, it was inconceivable that such a village could be kept totally isolated, given the need for people in the ""real world"" to guard it (as the ending of the movie makes clear.) That bit of unreality aside, the predictability of the story took a lot of enjoyment away from it, as did the strange decision to have the characters speak in that stilted manner of speech that they used. That seemed to have no logical purpose other than to help to create an atmosphere that convinces you that you're dealing with a community that existed generations ago. Why would they adopt that manner of speech? What difference would it make to them? It really didn't make sense, and frankly it became quite annoying after a while. With the words used and the way the lines were being delivered, it was kind of like watching a movie that starred a cast of emotionless and over-proper Vulcans (if you get the Star Trek analogy.) I have to say that I was disappointed. Shyamalan can do (and has done) a lot better than this.",The Village
40,Buddy-51,better than advertised,7,22 August 2005,"Though it's sure not to be everyone's cup of tea, M Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" plays like a good old-fashioned ""Twilight Zone"" episode all done up in period costume and expanded out to feature film length.Set in the late 1800's, the story - which plays like a cross between ""The Crucible"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" - takes place in a small village that has been cut off from the outside world by strange and potentially deadly creatures who inhabit the woods nearby. These mysterious figures - referred to by the townsfolk as Those We Don't Speak Of - have made some sort of pact with the humans to the effect that they will leave the people alone if the people leave them alone. However, one individual in the town - a young man named Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) - has an aching desire to leave the village and explore the world beyond the parameters of the woods. It is that unprecedented willingness to cross the barrier and violate the pact that sets the story in motion.""The Village"" is obviously intended to be an allegory about how humans use fear of the unknown to keep themselves from venturing out to worlds beyond their own, and, concomitantly, to justify hiding from the ugliness of life. The film has the stripped-down look and feel of a morality play performed on a stage whose sets are simple and stark and whose characters and dialogue are weighted down with heavy symbolic value. ""The Village"" requires patience from the audience and an acceptance going into the film that this will not be a horror movie in the traditional sense - i.e. one filled with gore and grue or high-octane chills and thrills - but rather a subdued exercise in portentousness and understated suggestion. In this respect, the movie works quite well.Heavily reliant as it is on imagery and mood to achieve its effects, this is less an actor's film that it is a director's, but Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody as the literal village idiot, deliver reasonably compelling performances. But it is Bryce Dallas Howard, as a young blind woman sent into the forest on a danger-filled mission to bring help back from town, who shines in the film.Shyamalan has made quite a lucrative career out of movies that use indirection rather than explicitness to generate their suspense. That ""The Village"" is the weakest of those films thus far (""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"" are more fully realized works), doesn't diminish the fact that those willing to give it a chance may find it to be a rewarding experience.",The Village
41,cherold,unsurprising and slow,5,30 July 2005,"It must be tough being director M. Night Shyamalan. He has built a career off of movies with unexpected turns, and I imagine with each movie it must get harder to come up with something. So while The Village only has two real twists, one of which is surprising but no more so than many other movies by more obscure filmmakers and the other of which I fully expected from the beginning of the film, I have to be fair and say, well, you can't get those great twists every time.The problem with the movie isn't the lack of twists but the fact that it's just rather dull. The stilted speaking style is sort of interesting but also a bit annoying and the story never grabs me. Judy Greer and Adrien Brody are both quite good and there are a couple of effective scenes of suspense, but for the most part the movie is so measured as to feel static.I think much of the problem is Shyamalan uses his twists to make the audience forgive him for any film-making faults. Signs wasn't a great movie, and without the surprising finale I would have walked away disappointed, but because it had a strong pay off it made everything alright. If Shyamalan has run out of clever twists then he is going to have to work on making his movies pay off not with a stunning denouement but with engaging and engrossing film making throughout. Hopefully he'll learn to do that, and won't even need the clever tricks that have endeared him to me.",The Village

It might have done had it been made 50 years ago and seen at a midnight movie drive-in. But then it wouldn't have had the pretentious twists that M Night Shyalaman feels obliged to foist on his audience. What was clever and even unsettling in ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" became just silly, if still a little scary in ""Signs"", and here is spun out interminably until boredom overtakes any sense of dread. This is a kid's fairy-tale scare picture without the scares, a morality tale with no moral.A stellar cast (and that includes the Best Actor Oscar winner of two years ago, Adrien Brody) manage to keep straight faces and act with a high seriousness bordering on insanity. In Jaoquin Phoenix it has a hero so unprepossessing as to be virtually non-existent. Am I missing something? Is there another layer underneath all this tosh full of profound meaning and subterfuge?

44,bowmanblue,M. Night Shyamalan's last decent film (in my opinion),8,25 September 2014,"The Indian auteur burst onto the scene with the classic 'The Sixth Sense' and followed it up with the equally impressive 'Unbreakable.' However, since then, his record at the box office has been shaky to say the least.In my opinion, 'The Village' (despite receiving mixed reviews) was his last excellent film, although I can see how it's not everyone's cup of tea. Those expecting a straight out horror film will be disappointed. And anyone hoping for bucket loads of blood and guts will be sorely disappointed. The Village is a slower affair, moody and well-shot as a group of people refuse to leave their village for fear of the creatures who live in the woods all around them.Perhaps The Village could be best described as a 'love story,' as the relationship between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is central to the story.The film boasts an impressive cast, all of whom play there parts subtly and with great understatement, all of which adds to the overall creepy, isolated environment.It's very possible to enjoy this movie, but only if you're in the mood for something a little more subtle. It's a slow burner if ever there was one, well shot, well acted and often overlooked. Give it a go if you're up for something a little different.",The Village
45,dromasca,welcome back M. Night Shyamalan,9,26 February 2005,"I was disappointed of M. Night Shyamalan falling under Mel Gibson's religious fervor and mixing science fiction with Catholicism in 'Signs'. Luckily, my concerns were eased by 'The Village'. M. Night Shyamalan is back, and 'The Village' sits well among his good movies.A previous commenter observed that two categories of viewers seek M. Night Shyamalan's movies. Those who like horror stories, and those who look for the hidden traps specific to his writing and directing. In my opinion both categories find good stuff here. The horror story thread is very convincing, and the first half of the movie recreates a 1800s American settlers environment mixed with a Gothic horror story thread that was very credible for me. Yes, I was willing to be fooled, but you need to be a willing fool if you want to enjoy horror movies. The explanation of the trap in the second part of the film has logic and morals. One may argue about the approach taken by the characters in their attempt to fly the evils of civilization, but not with the quality of the cinema used to give the story.Cinematography fits well the twists of the action, with a color code that is well explained and will soon become part of the stony. Acting is superb. Jaochin Phoenix and Adrien Brody give two of their best performances ever, William Hurt is William Hurt, and the fresh face of Bryce Dallas Howard fills in well the screen in her first lead role.Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.",The Village
46,MLDinTN,a big disappointment,4,28 July 2005,"I'm glad I didn't pay to see this after watching it. I really liked Night's other 3 films, esp. Signs, which I thought was great. But this was dull, too easy to figure out, and not tense or scary. Also the funny lines were missing that were in Signs. This movie moves at too slow a pace. The film is about a village in a remote place where the elders tell everyone not to go beyond the borders because creatures live in the woods. It centers around 3 people: a blind girl Ivy, the guy she likes Lucius, and a mentally retarded man, Noah, who likes Ivy. Events happen that lead Ivy to want to venture to other towns in search of medicines. So even before she leaves, the ""big secret"" is revealed. So half the movie, we already know the plot twist, which makes it much less tense and exciting. And the demise of Noah isn't thrilling either.FINAL VERDICT: I never thought I'd dis a Knight film, but I don't recommend this one.

This film, The Village, is not a bad film at all, but the story is clunky and is all over the place. Unfortunately, I was able to see the signature twist ending from a mile away, but maybe that was because I saw Scary Movie 4 spoof this film. But, this film is pretty creepy and the cinematography is excellent thanks to Roger Deakins.M. Night's film is about a secluded village out in the middle of nowhere that has a secret. This secret, that the woods surrounding the village is swarming with monsters, is challenged when one of the villagers wants to venture out in the woods.The film is well-acted for the most part. The film has an all-star cast and they do well with what the were given. Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrien Brody, and William Hurt all do really good in their roles.Overall, this is a decent film that racks up a few thrills. I was disappointed with the ending which I would have found weak even if I haven't known what was going to happen. I feel bad for M.

50,851222,Good atmospheric thriller,8,8 September 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Village"" (2004) was probably the last good movie from M. Night Shyamalan, after near masterpiece ""The Sixth Sense"", and terrific movies ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"". It is not as good as those three movies, but it's a damn good atmospheric / drama thriller with some twists along the way. There are couple of twists in this movie, and watching this movie back in 2004 in cinema (i was a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan at that moment) i was hugely disappointed by first twist, but the second (and last) was amazing - didn't see that coming for sure. Acting is good in this movie, with Bryce Dallas Howard best performance (period) and strong supportive acting by the great Joaquin Phoenix. The whole cast is great in here, and although not everyone received opportunity to shine, they all did a pretty good job in my opinion. Direting is good, but movie drags a bit there and there mainly because of script - it is good but inconsistent.The best part of this movie is in its atmosphere, which is created beautifully here (superb sound design (picture has to be seen with the best possible sound system) and good cinematography). There are some great suspenseful scenes as well - kudos to great direction in those scenes.Overall, ""The Village"" has problems with pacing, but overall experience is very positive. It's best parts are not in conversations (which drags a bit due to script), but in overall mood and some great suspenseful scenes as well as feeling that something isn't right in here and question ""who or what is behind this all"". When all questions will be answered, some of them are very disappointing, but most of them will force you re-think and probably re-watch this movie twice - and it is worth seeing it more than once (but two times will be definitely enough).",The Village

Mr. Shyamalan has attempted a very difficult task of creating a horror-like movie with a major twist. In an effort to use audience's past impression of his prior works, Mr. Shyamalan taps into this impression in a major way to create an illusion - the major premise of this film. In an effective, though not entirely satisfactory way, Mr. Shyamalan is able to pull off a very human, sensitive, and thoughtful thriller that reflects more of humanity than on the occult or horror. It is impossible to know if any other director/writer could have improved on Mr. Shyamalan's attempt in this movie since he is operating on a singular premise of fear, horror, and monster-mythology in a way that is perhaps unattainable. He is to be commended for his efforts at an entirely different way to perceive reality and reflects both the confusion in today's world to another alternative way to seeing it that in the end may have not ultimate resolution.

If you are looking for a love story, the film fails to create any sparks, and quite frankly, Joaquin Phoenix grunts most of his lines so even understanding him is a challenge. As a horror movie it creates some atmosphere, and then leaves the audience hanging cruelly waiting, and waiting for the dreaded creatures to appear. The acting leaves a lot to be desired as most lines are delivered in a very emotionless way.

I will say this: Whereas today's ""wonderboy"" director JJ Abrams is all about time travel and relative physics concepts, M. Night's trademark was misdirection. You think this movie is about one thing, but in the end it is 180-degrees of surprise.Overall, this is a suspenseful, mysterious film that will have you on the edge of your seat.

56,Floated2,Few creepy moments but nothing special,5,5 May 2020,"Having seen almost all of M. Night Shyamalan's films but not seeing The Village, but hearing much praise (mainly from fans claiming how underrated and underappreciated the film is). The film offers several good ideas, but at times doesn't exactly live up to the expectations one had thought. Up until this point in his career, Shyamalan had directed the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. All of which one would consider to be better than The Village. Although the Village is most definitely better than both his next two films of the decade (Lady in the Water & The Happening). This isn't exactly a good sign as it showed he regressed.The concept seems relatively interesting but given it's little twists it wasn't nearly as great or grande of a twists as expected. It was relatively simple when thinking about it. Also somewhat silly and confusing. For instance, within part of the plot. Why would they allow Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard)- being blind to be the one find medicine to heal Lucious (Joaquin Phoenix) in the woods herself? Also the supposed twist involving Noah (Adrien Brody)- playing a mentally challenged character disguising himself with the costume of the ""woods creature"" attacking Ivy in the woods was rather bizarre and questionable. What his intent of hurting her? If so why?The Village is most definitely more of character drama than a horror film, which many seem to despise as it was marketed as a horror. There are some creepy jump scares elevated with its horror tone and tense music. But as a whole, this film was at most times somewhat boring and rather lifeless.Bryce Dallas Howard was the highlight of the film as she was essentially the lead here, carrying the film for most of the second half. Which in a way is disappointing as Joaquin Phoenix's character is non-existent within the final forty-five minutes or so. Once his character gets stabbed by Adrien Brody, he is put aside and doesn't have any more speaking lines as we see him in about one or two more scenes ""healing"".Overall, the film had good ideas but it wasn't exactly handled well. Nothing completely amazing and once the supposed ""twist"" is over, it wares off. Meaning this film possibly wouldn't be as good on a second and later viewings.",The Village
57,johnnyboyz,A Film that tests the viewers attention and forces them to think for themselves about the probability of something being believable or not. Clever and engaging.,6,4 November 2007,"The Village is one of those films that comes very close to perhaps being one of the greatest ever made, it also comes close to being one of the biggest cheats ever put across in film and thus; comes closer still to being one of the worst ever made. I was undecided after viewing it very recently and I'm still undecided now  maybe time will clear my mind and maybe my opinion will change somewhat. I'm sure there are people that hate The Village because people like to be shown things that they recognise and like to be told what's what; but not here as here, you have to exercise your mind.I'm all for 'twist' endings. I think the twist, when used correctly can be the one reason for a films greatness. Sometimes it's used well with The Usual Suspects being an excellent example as clues and hidden messages in something so immaterial as someone's eyes focusing on a certain thing can be the difference between knowing and not knowing. Other times, such as in De Palma's 2002 film Femme Fatale, the whole thing falls flat on its face leaving us cheated, angry and sad. The Village's twist works and if you watch it with no knowledge of it and without having seen any trailers or clips prior to the film; it really, really works.I didn't quite know what to think at the end of The Village. On one had, it's a very clever film that has you believe one thing, leads you down a path and then pulls out the path from under you but on another hand, it's a complete waste of time  a mere exercise in 1890s mise-en-scene, cinematography and dialogue that is shot, edited and then has a silly revelation attached to the end. Shyamalan is no fool when it comes to hinting at his story. The film was marketed as a horror film but I think this was deliberate to throw you off. I was surprised at the different genres The Village seemed to fall into: there was the horror, of course but then there was the element of fantasy, look at it logically: It's 1890s America and all these people are living in fear of monsters that live in a nearby wood with no other community around for miles except beyond the dreaded wood. The people also seem too submissive to the monsters since they encroach and kill livestock and yet just like in Signs and Lady in the Water, people would rather run and hide than face them and fight  similarly to what I said about Lady in the Water: the problem is nothing a 12 gauge wouldn't solve (or a similar firearm given it's the 1890s) The film also contains elements of the fantasy genre. When a character stated that she had her ""memories locked up in that box"", I thought ""how the hell do you lock a memory in a box?"" Given the what the film has us believe up until this point, I expected it to be this big, glowing ball of energy that rises up out of whatever it's in: how else is a 'memory' supposed to look in a physical form? From here, The Village becomes a love story very briefly with murder and heartache playing a large role. The film changes direction again: you don't get love stories in horror films as in depth and crisp as this one; another tick in the film's 'negative' column. But wow, was I wrong. The reason I mention all these things is that there is a logical explanation for it all and I knew there would be. The film isn't set in another dimension or another world, why would it be? It hasn't been established like it was in Lord of the Rings so you have to assume its here and now on Planet Earth. The Village looks like it has so many things wrong with it from frame one and yet thinking back after you know the ending, everything makes sense. Even if it seems bad and incorrect at the time, does it make it bad and incorrect if there's a reason for it? One example of what I'm saying can be seen in the character of Ivy Walker (Howard). A village elder sends her to the next town through the haunted woods but she's blind  great idea, huh? Not only this but she doesn't set off at dawn to beat the dark and she and her accomplice stop when it rains instead of keeping going to avoid illness or the monsters. All of these things sound suicidal and at the time, I was wondering what the hell they were all thinking; and yet it all makes sense when you look back following the revelation: why would someone send a blind person on a dangerous mission involving cannibalistic monsters, shortly before it gets dark? The answer is not as difficult as you think.The Village is a criss-cross of genres; ranging from horror, thriller, fantasy, romance and possibly science fiction but it's not what you think since the film actually changes genre towards the end to something else that probably doesn't even exist  that itself is an achievement. Despite the lingering shots of empty rocking chairs and bare trees blowing in the wind adding an avant-garde feel (but keeping you alert as you try and work out why they're there, pointlessly), The Village maintains concentration and attention throughout without being too un-obvious.",The Village
58,filipemanuelneto,A movie with no story or plot.,2,22 February 2017,"This film tells of a small village where people live as they did a hundred years ago and totally isolated from the rest of the world, fearing nameless creatures that live in the surrounding forest. This idea seems something worthy of a horror movie and it could have been taken of that way, but no. Night Shyamalan decided to play with one thing: the idea that cities are the source of society's corruption. The whole movie revolves around this, which is to say that you have almost no story. It starts well, manages to create a good atmosphere and I quickly realized that there is something rotten in that village. But the absence of a strong main plot, capable of sustaining the film, causes it to lose its rhythm and crawl through uninteresting subplots, created to ""fill the sausage"" with anything that would justify it to the end. And even the ending was disappointing, as I expected something stronger and more dramatic, something that would make everything worth it.Positive things? Yes! The actors did a good job, as far as they were allowed. Few stood out because there was little to do and little to work with. Adrien Brody managed to do it, although his character is poor and Bryce Dallas Howard was the actress who appeared and shone, but was not always the most positive. There are moments when her performance is quite forced. The scenarios were well made, the use of the forest was intelligent, cinematography was good as was the use of colors. But is anyone going to see a movie just for that? Of course not. Anyone who wants a good story will not like this movie.",The Village
59,leplatypus,Very sleepy but not hollow (dad),4,28 January 2017,"Shamalayan follows the footsteps of Spielberg as the two are really into delivering a story: for sure, this movie has a really mysterious one that catches the attention of the audience. However Shamalayan has not his skills as this movie just crumbles unto itself with its boring, endless dull scenes and terrible lack of pace! We have left with some beautiful Gothic American pastoral landscape (as seen in the movie parodied in my title), a few really tense moment but most of the time, i have been bored and used my remote control to give first aid to this comatose movie! It's funny to notice that in 2017 i just kept watching Hurt in movies and that Phoenix is still unable to give us a character with passion!",The Village
60,Tweetienator,Outside the Horror Awaits,7,25 May 2019,"The Village got a good production, a fine mix of mystery with some traces of horror, and a nice twist (first time watching it is a really good one), and of course, an excellent cast (Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt etc.). Suitable if you like movies like The Sixth Sense, Signs, The Others, or Sleepy Hollow.",The Village
61,BaronBl00d,No Spoilers...Just Spoiled!,4,29 January 2005,"The Village was immensely disappointing on many levels for me. Shamalayan does a decent job with the camera. I can't fault his work with the camera too much, but the story he used for this film is anything BUT mysterious. I mean the ending is wildly predictable if you have a brain. Think about it...could there have been any other resolution. No. And so...I knew the ""big"" secret way too early. The film had no punch for me at all. But that aside, the pacing for this film was real slow. Virtually nothing happens in this village. I know the village people(no cop or construction worker here) were meant to seem Amish-like, but something a little more ""meaty"" could have happened. The music gave you a warning that something interesting was going to happen with a thunderous boom...only to see something like a shadow in the grass. The acting isn't bad. It is pretty decent with Ron Howard's daughter Bryce doing a pretty good job in the lead. Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleason, and William Hurt all do workmanlike jobs. Joaquin Phoenix was unimpressive and Adrian Brody as the village idiot was not terribly believable. But like the film...their performances really go nowhere. I will not discuss the plot in any great detail, because the slightest detail given and the ""gig"" is up. All I remember saying after the film was something to the effect that I was very glad I did not pay $7.50 to see this film. The idea the film has, if it had been handled differently, might have been the catalyst for a real good story about...well, I cannot say. But it could have been better. you must take my word.",The Village

Night and even if it is not on level on films like Sixth Sense,Unbreakable and Signs it was still a very unique and interesting watch at least.This film had some interesting ideas in it that had big potential expecely mitology about monsters in woods but twist about them were little lame made and i wasnt so impressed with it.In other hand second twist was very good and it surprised fe first time when i watch film and not it still holds up in some ways.Village was a watchable film with great scenary ,locations,images and score",The Village
63,Anonymous_Maxine,It's all about the scenery.,6,2 February 2005,"I read one IMDb user's review of The Village which stated that M. Night made a mistake releasing The Sixth Sense because it made everyone in the world expect some earth shattering twist at the end of all of his movies, which is almost right. Luckily, this reviewer goes on to explain that M. Night has been trying ever since The Sixth Sense to recapture that awe that he created in his first major audiences, which IS right. In The Village, M. Night tries too hard to lead the audience in one direction that when we are brought back to reality it inspires an ""oh, please"" reaction rather than awe.I have tremendous respect for the immense film-making talent of M. Night Shyamalan, so I am not willing to fault him for making a weak film, but I am also not willing to see him create a weak film and then not say that it's a weak film. The look of it puts the time period sometime in the 1800's or an Amish community in Pennsylvania in the 1800s, 1900s, 2000s, etc. M. Night actually claims in the making-of documentary included with the DVD that the movie was set in the 1800s because he wanted to create an atmosphere of innocence. A small village of people seem to have been living under an agreement with some sort of malicious creatures that live in the woods that surround their village. They don't go in the woods, the creatures don't come out and hurt any of them.Because of M. Night's reputation for surprise endings, I doubt that many people read reviews of his movies unless they've already seen them. Even so, here is the obligatory spoiler warning  SPOILER AHEAD! What I like about the movie is that, while the twist is firmly in the realm of the ludicrous, it is at least very well explained, even if not ever credibly. There are vague explanations about how government officials have been paid off to prevent airplanes from flying over the village and terrifying the townspeople, no one is ever allowed to go into what is called an animal preserve, and in one of the last scenes, newspaper clippings reveal the suffering that many of the founders of the village have suffered, thus inspiring them to create it.I can certainly understand their motivations, especially since they have all suffered extremely, through the murders of loved ones, rape, burglary, etc. I live in Los Angeles and anytime I get a freaking parking ticket I just about want to move out of the country. But the problem is that they respond to their suffering by creating a society that is maintained by instilling fear in all of its residents.This fear is maintained much the same way that the fear of Voldemort was maintained in the Harry Potter stories. He is referred to as ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" by everyone except Harry Potter, who uses his name freely due to a total lack of fear. The creatures in the woods in this movie are referred to as ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" as they are constantly spoken of in never-ending efforts to keep everyone scared.It is an interesting exploration of M. Night's technique, but the payoff is such a tremendous letdown that it is almost difficult to pay attention to the explanations that justify the possibility of the village's existence because of the disappointment. The movie is well made, the script is not.",The Village
64,jtindahouse,"Great Directing, Great Acting, Brilliant Movie!!!",8,20 September 2004,"The fact that Sigourney Weaver had nightmares for two weeks after she read the script of this movie shocked me because it simply wasn't that kind of movie. It wasn't made to leave you having nightmares or lying in bed awake for the next two weeks. The bits that were meant two be scary were there just to give you an instant shock. What this movie was obviously trying to achieve was leaving you thinking about that little parts and whether or not they added up to the storyline. The storyline itself was stunning and original. M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent, brilliant and original writer and director and the fact that he has cameos in all his movies is another original thing that he does which I think is very clever. He's not at all a bad actor either. The best part about him being in the movie is that he can do it exactly how he wants which no actor could do. Joaquin Phoenix's acting was perfect and the trivia that the role was written for him was something I could believe. Sigourney Weaver nothing special from her, didn't stand out. Bryce Dallas Howard was excellent in her blind woman's role although it was quite hard to catch on to the fact she was blind at the start. William Hurt was without a doubt the second best performance in this film by a mile but the stand out for me was Adrien Brody playing the retard. After seeing this performance I can't wait to see him in his next big role movie King Kong. All in all an outstanding movie that is well worth it's money and much much more.",The Village
65,elshikh4,Weak & Alleged !,1,25 May 2008,"They told me that this was an excellent movie from Hollywood. They told me that this was (M. Night Shyamalan)'s masterpiece. They told me that it grossed 5 times its budget. Well, they never told me that they, themselves, were fools!This is, without a doubt, the worst of (Shyamalan)'s suspenseful pieces yet. (The Sixth Sense - 1999) was good but for one watching, (Unbreakable - 2000) was breakable but artistic, (Signs - 2002) got fine meaning, but was a (The War of The World)'s rip-off, and although (The Village - 2004) has some idea about fear which delays or retards a community, but it's the most alleged and less entertaining movie in the list.At first, you might strive strong feelings of boredom by saying: ""HEY, it's unusual. Give it a chance. It's some oddity. Novelty. Difference"". But later on, you would regret it badly. For instance, (Shyamalan) leads the first 40 minutes as quiet as possible, to surprise us with the sudden appearance of the monsters, like the same trick in (Alfred Hitchcock)'s (The Birds - 1963). That could have been masterfully done if this horror sequence was effective enough. However, it was chilly instead of chilling, and you really lost your time. And the funny thing is: you can say that again about the rest of the movie!It's deprived of convincing catchy characters, or brilliant hot conflict, which's the interpretation of dull. The drama's emptiness miscarried the profound meaning. And it shifts you from one unsatisfying point to another; whereas it begins with some detached bland scenes like it's a French new wave film, then it's a childish horror movie, with primitive thrill and unscary monsters, then it's a (Shyamalan) movie, with his trade-mark plot twist, giving us 2 in a row, however soullessly made somehow. All of that created a perfectly unsatisfying viewing.Speaking about those 2 twists, the first is when we discover that the monsters are none other than the elders. Then, the second is when we discover that the events don't take place in the old times, it's the present time, and the elders are - in fact - a bunch of university graduates or professors, who wanted once to build Utopia. So, in the end, it's the beginning of the revolution to make this community maybe more utopian. However, look how all of that is done!Logical Questions: How those people managed to separate this village from the whole world? How did they build it in the first place? How they got all of that old costumes, sets, and equipments? Why the father left his own blind daughter into the forest alone? Why he didn't go with her as long as there was no monster but himself??Moreover, the scene of the blind girl and the newbie park ranger is highly comedic, (Shyamalan) plays the head park ranger horribly, and was he - as the writer - giving us a bounce: a symbolically political satire?! You have to feel that the head park ranger's monologue refers to how the bigger society can be ruled by an authority that owns the knowledge for itself, and makes the people busy with fake ghosts, for executing a hidden agenda. Remember bombing Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan after one week of Monica-gate, or claiming the presence of nuclear weapons in Iraq for controlling it and its petroleum,.. etc. It could be a well-meaning satire, however made in a weak and unconvincing way. And, originally, wasn't unveiling the monsters' truth an enough twist and a nice substance?! But No. Mr. (Shyamalan) had to contain 2 twists instead of 1, while ""Be extravagant"" mostly means ""Spoil""; in English language, and cinema too!Clearly, this script just incapacitated everything through such a dim-witted treatment, and the direction handled the matters coldly. Therefore, the movie ended up as tiresome, assuming, and fatuously made. In one word, there is no horror, or else!No performance was any useful, despite the honorable names. Seriously, what's the use of great machines in a deactivated factory?! It was painful how actors like (Brendan Gleeson) or (Sigourney Weaver) looked so naive, or deceived, in a dead drama like this. And (William Hurt) seemed so imbecile, particularly in his last 4 scenes; like he was doing a Shakespearean play in a nursery school's stage. It's not the problem of ""There was no good acting, since there were no good roles"". It's the tragedy of ""There was ludicrous acting, since there were ludicrous roles!"".Fairly, I didn't find anything to enjoy. Maybe (Bryce Dallas Howard)'s wonderful smile, and sound of laughter, only!So in this kind of work, you'd never notice why the progeny of fear was whether a mentally-handicapped, or blind, or teenager anyway. Because (M. Night Shyamalan), its very much creator, was its very much killer, to be eventually a comedy, like the last sequence. Or rather a black comedy about killing your own idea, making an idiot movie, and being loved by millions of fools in the same time as well!Sorry, I hate to watch a bad movie, I hate it more when it turns into a hit, and I hate it to the utmost when it alleges high meanings.",The Village
66,generationofswine,An Honest Review,10,10 December 2016,"The hate again is geared to the fact that it is a Shyamalan movie and it's hip to hate on him now.It always seems to be that way, shocking how many people hate on things because it's hip and not really because of any honestly valid reason: ""It sucks because, because, it's a Shyamalan movie and we all think he's self-important."" The fact is that, yet again, he gave people something new...and they despise him for it.But not only that it is a great allegory for 2004. Terror threats were common back then. We were told to live in fear. Today is an orange day, be scared. Today is a red day, be terrified. And nothing ever came of it, but a frightened population is a controlled population. It's a population that doesn't explore or ask many questions.The Village does a great job of expressing that. A society controlled through fear and fear used to hide an enormous secret, to cover up a big lie with another lie.But again, in typical Shyamalan fashion, it is a subtle parallel. It's one that doesn't stand out in the glaring fashion that you'd see in any other political movie.And, again, it is original, but because of that, like all his other movies that broke away from the re-boot, re-made, re-hashed style of Hollywood, he got labeled and people hate him for being unique and having the courage to make his own stories come to life.",The Village
67,freemantle_uk,Shyamalan decline begins,4,5 January 2010,"After hitting the world with The Sixth Sense M. Night Shyamalan was considered on of the hottest directors around. He got himself Oscar nominations and was considered to direct Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. His next project was Unbreakable which did fairly well critically, but not so successful at the box-office. His follow-up was Signs, which won critically acclaim, and is a film I like, but has split film fans into lovers and haters. After all that Shyamalan started going down. His next film The Village was not so successful, critically or commercially, before really loosing the plot when making Lady in the Water and The Happening.The Village is set in a small rural community at the turn of the century. It is run by a good of village elders, including Edward Walker (William Hurt), Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) and August Nicholson (Brendan Gleeson). It seems to function like early colonial towns in America, with town meetings to decide issues. However, this is no ordinary town: in the woods are strange creatures that could attack the village. Anything red is bury because it's considered the bad colour, whilst yellow is the colour of protection. There is a truce between the village and the creature, but something ends up attacking and killing some animals. One of the younger members of the community, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) offers to risk his life to get medicine from the nearest town. He would have to walk through the forest to do this. He believes that the creatures wouldn't attack him because of his noble intentions. But the elders refuse. Lucius also rekindles his friendship with Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind woman and daughter of Edward. They start to fall for each other and end up getting engaged. However, Lucius gets stabbed, and Ivy ends up having to leave the village to get medicine for him.The Village was marketed as an interesting horror film, but has a was really a film about social control. The social control idea by itself is interesting, but the way it was handle should have been a lot better. I think it would have made a better film as a proper horror film in a period settling. It could have been very scary and effective with a proper fresh twist. But Shyamalan did not do this. Shyamalan is a director who is famous for having a twist in his films. I don't mind that, but if you see that ended up trying to make a more grounded film at the end it ends up making the film fall of plot holes. This twist doesn't work like it did with the Sixth Sense. The writing is the problem, but Shyamalan's direction is decent. He's not perfect but there are some good shots in the film.The film's main strength is the cast. Bryce Dallas Howard has a strong debut and is a pretty interesting character. Joaquin Phoenix and Adrian Brody are both normally good in their films and they don't break that trend here. William Hurt was a little hit and miss, but he does have a really good moment when arguing with the Elders. However Sigourney Weaver offers a weak performance compared to what she usually does, and Brendan Gleeson's (who I normally like) character may as well not have been in the film.There are some interesting ideas and decent scenes, but it should have been a lot better.",The Village
68,strong-122-478885,Plot holes Here. Plot holes There. Plot holes. Plot holes. Everywhere!,1,3 June 2013,"Writer/Director M. N. Shyamalan is a dingle-berry and his precious, little ""Village"" movie is an absolute insult to my intelligence as a rational, thinking person.Filled to overflowing with annoyingly misleading red herrings and gaping plot holes galore, if Shyamalan really expects me to take this picture's preposterous story at face value, then he's an even bigger idiot than the village idiot was in The Village.To say that this film, which loftily takes itself way too seriously, is absurd to the point of being downright laughable would truly be an understatement of the highest order.This film's premise is such a gross miscalculation of logic that it cannot rationally support itself and expect to get away with it without being harshly criticized.All-in-all, The Village amounts to being nothing but a long, drawn-out, 2-hour lie. It proves, beyond a doubt, that Shyamalan has very little, if any, respect for the intelligence of his audience.",The Village
69,dfranzen70,The Village Idiot,2,31 July 2004,"I am now officially off the M. Night Shyamalan bandwagon. Nope, that's it, I'm through giving him the benefit of the doubt. See, I really loved The Sixth Sense. Thought it was fantastic. Creepy, too. I liked Unbreakable, too. Sure, it was flawed, and I could see how some people might not like it, but I appreciated with Shyamalan was doing, and I liked the two lead performances. But then Signs came. And I thought Signs was hideously dreadful, lacking a sense of humor when it was needed and being way too flippant when the situation called for levity. I felt Signs was merely a product of an overactive ego and an inactive imagination. But I figured that since even the best filmmakers have their vanity movies, I'd forgive Shyamalan his Signs and looked forward to his next movie. Well, The Village isn't much better than Signs, and that's a real shame.The setting is 1897 in a remote village in the Pennsylvania woods. It's a very quiet, unpreposessing village, complete with village elders, politeness among folk, and a one-room school house. (These folks look and act Amish, although that's not specified.)But this idyllic, placid hamlet has a secret. See, it's bordered on all sides by the forest, and within the forest are these unspeakable creatures, Those Who Shall Not Be Named. Oddly enough, you would think such an appellation would prevent people from openly discussing said creatures, but I lost count how many times they were mentioned. Anyway, the creatures, we're told, have a deal with the villagers - no villager will cross the perimeter into the forest, and no creature will enter the village. The villagers have yellow flags around their perimeter and a giant tower with a bell at the top, so if and when a creature comes a-calling, the bell can be rung and people can get to safety. The village elders, led by Edward Walker (William Hurt, sincere as always), forbid anyone from crossing the perimeter; the villagers are also informed that the creatures hate the color red (""the bad color,"" as it's called in hushed whispers!).Weird things have been afoot, though. Small animals have been killed in the village, skinned and left to be discovered by open-mouthed villagers. And when a creature is indeed spotted entering the perimeter, the next morning there are slashes of red paint on the doors of people's homes. What could this mean? Who hath breached the perimeter?One man, Lucius Hunt (played with open-mouth ennui by Joaquin Phoenix), asks the elders for permission to go to a neighboring village to get medicine. You see, the village is hampered by a distinct lack of medical supplies, and when its citizens are quite ill, they have no choice but to watch them die. They'd prefer this, apparently, to getting medical supplies.Now, any time the phrase ""only one man"" pops up in a synopsis of a movie, you know you need to relax your curiosity and just let things happen. ""Oh, here we go,"" you think. ""Good IL' Commodus is going to be the One Man who can save the villagers from the creatures - and themselves!""There are a few twists to the movie, so I'll halt the synopsis here. The trouble is the twists are likely to affect you in one of two ways: Either you'll say, ""I saw THAT coming,"" or you'll merely shrug your shoulders and wonder if the exit door to the theater will open to a part of the parking lot that's a real hike to your car. Personally, I was affected in both ways.The movie's simply not well written. There's suspense, but often it's clouded by contrivances in the plot. Shyamalan wants us to fear the creatures as much as the villagers do, but he doesn't succeed. We're supposed to feel empathy for the villagers, but all I could feel was pity and scorn.The pacing is pretty tight, which is nice, since it's essential that a suspense movie be well paced. But the camera angles often looked amateurish and/or auteurish; either Shyamalan didn't know how to shoot a particular scene or he decided to be cute and make it seem as if the scene had some sort of Deep Meaning. Now, it's true there's a moral to the story here (something about You Stay on Your Side, I'll Stay on Mine), but the tone achieved by the direction didn't really convey that. A huge debit, too, is the soundtrack - does Shyamalan not know how to use one effectively? In most scenes, the soundtrack was blaring at such a high volume that the actors could barely be heard. What's the point of that, exactly?Finally, the acting. No one is spectacularly miscast (although I wonder if Adrien Brody, who won an Oscar for goodness sake, is kicking himself for agreeing to play the village idiot), but no one really shines, either. How could they, with a plot so thin you could read fine print through it? Most of the actors are... well, useless. They don't do much with what little they have to work with and are essentially wasted, especially Sigourney Weaver. Hurt is quietly effective, but it's a role he can play in his sleep by this point. Newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard is moderately annoying, which ain't good when you have a very prominent role.The Village is trite and cloying, a mishmash of ""twists"" that alternately make no sense and make too much sense and can be foretold well in advance. M. Night Shyamalan has taken a pretty solid, intriguing premise and riddled it with illogic and disdain.",The Village
70,ackstasis,Definitely Underrated! **(NO SPOILERS)**,8,21 July 2006,"This film is hardly a horror movie. In fact, I'm certain it was never really meant to be. Writer and director M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Signs) is a master at creating his own fairy-tale worlds, and his films are wreathed in beauty and symbolism.This film is certainly a beautiful one. The art design is fitting, and James Newton Howard's musical score is beyond perfect. The film moves slowly, as it must to achieve this level of beauty. I believe this is why the film is often misunderstood- many watched it expecting to see a quick-paced, terrifying suspenseful thriller (not unlike the brilliant 'The Sixth Sense') but, instead, were met with something quite different.I will not delve into any details about the plot or the characters, since I think it would be better off to approach this film with as little prior knowledge as possible. Just don't go expecting a genuinely scary thriller, because it's not what you'll get. If you keep an open mind, you might just see something even better!",The Village
71,dee.reid,A most complex and troublesome film,7,18 August 2004,"""The Village,"" M. Night Shyamalan's latest twisting thriller, is full of ideas and creepy moments, but is hurt by much subtle complexity and very troubling storytelling.  Since he hit it big in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense,"" he has become one of Hollywood's last truly innovative filmmakers, and therein lies the problem (I think).We've come to expect so much from him lately, that we may flock to his latest flick and then comes a big letdown after a most wonderful buildup. But that doesn't automatically make ""The Village"" any less thoughtful; at least he tries.  Most other directors wouldn't have lasted past the first hour.Shyamalan has been on a wild streak since ""The Sixth Sense,"" and most people would agree (though I don't) that ""Unbreakable"" was a letdown and the masses are pretty much divided on ""Signs.""  Die-hards will unanimously agree that ""The Village"" is a monumental letdown and should never have seen the light of day.Superstition is the latest topic up for discussion with ""The Village."" Shyamalan seems to have an interest in exploiting certain aspects of our culture and using them to full effect.  In ""The Sixth Sense,"" it was childhood fears and ghost stories.  In ""Unbreakable,"" we learned about superheroes and that they may be ordinary people like you or me.  In ""Signs,"" we got a lesson about faith and an alien invasion.""The Village"" plays with the popular superstitions of a Puritan-like community and uses those to set up a story about deadly creatures that live in the woods outside the town.  And one of its citizens is questioning those beliefs and is eager to see what truly lies outside the town's borders. Shyamalan plays with these beliefs, getting us to accept them like the people of this community and terrorize us at the same time.He has a way with endings and ""The Village"" is no different from any of his previous three blockbusters.  To me, it did come as a big shock and was totally un-hinted on earlier in the film.  In ""The Village"" however and unlike the previous three, Shyamalan has created an atmosphere that is deliberately misleading and that is something I didn't find in ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" or ""Signs.""All in all, ""The Village"" is still a valiant, if somewhat lacking effort from one of our last and most innovative directors.",The Village

73,XweAponX,Lots of great things here,10,13 April 2015,"This is not just some film about some kind of Amish colony, or any group of religious society shut-outs. If there is any religion proffered by this ""Village"", it is not mentioned. It is not important.It's also not any kind of ""Horror"" film, which is what it was promoted as. Although it has it's suspenseful moments. These people are basically normal, except for a few things: They will not ever return to ""The Towns"" which is what they call the outside world, and they won't wear Red, or go into ""The Woods"".Or else, ""Those we must not speak of"" will come. Whoever or whatever they are, becomes something we in fact focus on, but in true M Night fashion, this is not what the film is about.What we have is a basically idyllic home for a group of people. The Elders have their secrets, and the young people are being given a set of ""Traditions"". But one kid, Noah (Adrien Brody) is a little different. He is referred to as ""An Innocent"" but it is clear even before we start seeing what is happening, he is not an innocent. He rocks back and forth in his chair as if Autistic, but he has speech. So, this character may have his own world in his mind which he lives in. We don't know much about that at first, but it is clear that Noah is a more complex individual than he lets on, and he is more intelligent than he is given credit for.The bright light in this film is mainly Bryce Dallas Howard, this was the first time I saw her in a film. She pulls off the Blind girl fairly believably, except her eye movement don't track a blind person's. A Blind person would not focus on anything- But that is a hard thing to duplicate if in fact you can see. Actually, Lili Taylor does a believable Blind girl in the 5th Season X-Files episode ""Minds Eye"", the closest portrayal I have ever seen - Her eyes wander off camera, never looking directly at who she is speaking to.The elder characters talk about people in their lives who had suffered violence, people who had been killed in various violent ways. There is more to this talk than just remembrance, it is an important point.In their artificial idyllic village, these people live as if in the 1800s, sans any modern medical technology. This is a point brought up a couple of times, by the character played by Joaquin Phoenix ""Lucius"" (Which may or may not be a reference to the film Gladiator where he had a nephew by that name) - He wants to go to ""The Towns"" to get Medicines. But the Elders give him all kinds of reasons why he can't do it.So we think this film is about these kids being raised to not depend on modern gadgetry and to avoid offending those that can't be spoken of, who live in the woods, so that is another taboo place. The entire younger generation of the village has been raised to believe in a set of Absolutes, you can't wear Red, you can't speak of the things that will come, and you can't go into the Woods. And, things happen that appear to validate these restrictions. So this false facade is upheld by a thin veneer of what Elder Walker (William Hurt) calls ""A farce"".A farce that if the kids knew about, it would destroy whatever sociological experiment is being conducted in The Village.And we think this film is about Lucius, who wants to marry Howard's character ""Ivy""- Until M Night's famous ""Reversal"" happens.It's at that point, Night slides in the reasons why the village exists, who the elders really are, and who the unspeakable creatures really are. But mainly, it's how a young blind girl can save the life of the one she loves, without the elders breaking any previous oaths they had taken. It's ""Yellow Riding Hood vs the Big Bad Wolf"" all over again, and ""Nothing is as it Seems"" as usual in Night's films.There are things Night likes to do as a Director, characters being shown in reflections in an object, which he does at the beginning of ""Unbreakable"", many other little trademarks, they are all here. Mainly there is wonderful imagery and rich character development, but the Village itself and the lifestyle of the people therein is the focal point of the film, it paid off that the whole cast was actually trained how to live in such an environment. You believe that they made all of their own clothes, they husband their own animals, they grew all of their vegetables, they made their own homes. If you can believe that, then the rest of the film falls into place.",The Village
74,MaxBorg89,"Not a masterpiece, but well executed and better than they want you to believe",8,18 June 2008,"After a seemingly invincible double hit consisting of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, M. Night Shyamalan hit a slightly false note with Signs, which is quite good but was strongly criticized nonetheless, mostly for its admittedly weak ending. The Village seems to continue in that direction, at least according to the majority of critics (Roger Ebert's review was particularly harsh). The reason I said ""seems"" is because The Village is a competent, enjoyable movie - not a masterwork, and occasionally less accomplished than Signs, but still undisputed proof of Shyamalan's gift as a storyteller.What sets this film apart from those preceding it is the setting: the titular village is located somewhere in Pennsylvania, and the date is the 19th Century. The village, inhabited by the elders, their children and grandchildren, is surrounded by woods, and no one is allowed to enter them. Why? Because the woods are supposedly populated by Those We Do Not Speak Of, some kind of monstrous breed that won't attack the villagers unless directly provoked. They occasionally show up after dark, and they're repulsed by the color red.Among the people living in the village who deserve to be mentioned are Lucius Fox (Joaquin Phoenix), a brave young man who doesn't fear the creatures like everyone else, and Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind girl with whom he has a special bond. When Lucius suddenly falls ill (to reveal more would spoil the fun), Ivy volunteers to travel to the city to find medicine, unafraid of defying whatever's hiding in the woods. Amongst the general protest, her father (William Hurt) expresses his approval with a cryptic phrase that gains significance as the story progresses.A slow start notwithstanding, Shyamalan manages to create a sense of quiet dread very quickly, thanks to expert use of camera angles, cinematography, and of course James Newton Howard's tunes. Subtly evoking The Wicker Man with its atmosphere, The Village drags the viewer into a different world, an uncontaminated society devoid of any real evil. In that sense, the film is a clever twist on the utopia genre: generally, these worlds exist in the future, not the past.However, that's not the kind of twist we expect from the director, and that's where the film's major disappointment reveals itself: the usual shocking final revelation is practically spoon-fed to the audience halfway through, not to mention delivered as flatly as is humanly possible. This does detract from the twist's impact, but it doesn't diminish its intelligence: taken on its own, it's worth comparing to the endings of Sixth Sense and Unbreakable.Then there's the cast, another partial misfire: although Hurt is warm and reassuring, Brendan Gleeson and Sigourney Weaver have practically nothing significant to do in the film, and Adrien Brody's demented role is nothing but a contrived plot device. On the flip-side, Phoenix is very good (the scene where Lucius tells Ivy how he feels about her is the most touching tender moment Shyamalan's filmed), and Howard, cast without an audition after the director saw her in a stage play (he didn't know she was related to former Happy Days star Ron Howard), is mesmerizing: playing her first major part without much experience (a few cameos in her dad's movies don't really count), she portrays Ivy as good-hearted and a little naive but never stupid, which is why she manages to hold the entire second half of the picture on her shoulders pretty much flawlessly.Bottom line: quit nagging about the ending. As I said in my review of The Sixth Sense, a good conclusion is no big thing if the overall movie disappoints. Well, the opposite applies too: a sub-par epilogue doesn't completely ruin an otherwise fine film.7,5/10",The Village
75,smatysia,"Different, anyway",7,23 March 2005,"OK, I suppose it is well known that there are significant plot twists in this film. I will not reveal them here, because I would have liked the film a lot less if I had known what they were. In fact, I am astounded that I was ignorant of them. If this had been a more highly regarded or higher-grossing film, than I am sure I would have heard. I will say that there were a few small things that made me wonder. The acting was almost all very low-key, with the exceptions of Adrien Brody, playing the village idiot, and Bryce Dallas Howard, as the blind vixen. Miss Howard was pretty good in some parts, but was (to me) totally unbelievable as a blind woman. Needs some work, but hey, she's young. The movie was at least different, and that's saying a lot in today's Hollywood.",The Village
76,kluseba,"Interesting intentions destroyed by a superficial story and conclusion, weak acting, silly atmosphere and a wrong preview and publicity",1,5 April 2010,"When I saw the preview of the film, I thought that I would watch a horror movie with a dark atmosphere, in an interesting place where many weird characters live isolated from the modern way of life. Well, I know that it was Shyamalan's intention to do a superficial preview and then to surprise those who expected a slasher movie. He wanted to cheat and laugh about us and to present his critical story about the society of the village to a larger public. Many viewer talk about the philosophic intention of the film which should make it more interesting, intellectual and profound than an ordinary horror movie.Okay, I understand all of those viewers... but when I go to watch what is announced and presented as a horror movie, I don't want to see a slow paced portrait of an isolated village that is manipulating population. Another thing is that the story is very low, has a very weak development, but normally, Shyamalan surprises us with an interesting ending like he did in ""The sixth sense"", but here, he fails, because the ending is not only quite disappointing to me, but was also very clear after I've had seen half of the movie. You expect something else than and in the end you have to realise: ""Oh no, he really made it end like this!"" A part of this wrong publicity and quite unspectacular ending, the actors are not touching the viewer and do almost all a quite poor job, the atmosphere is too forced, too exaggerated so that it isn't a menacing, dark atmosphere any more, but a quite silly one after a while, especially while the girl is walking through the forest in the end. And concerning the critical or philosophic element of the movie, Shyamalan just touches the topic, but doesn't go deep or intellectual enough to underline his thoughts and intentions with which I would mostly agree. This element could have been very interesting and open-minded, but the explanation in the end seems just to be a weak excuse for a slow and boring movie without any shocking element. It,s quite interesting to discuss about those intentions, but it isn't sadly worth watching this movie.If you'd like a horror movie taking place in an isolated old school village, check out a movie like ""Population 436"".",The Village

80,JoeKarlosi,The Village (2004) **1/2,6,1 August 2004,"After seeing the very good THE SIXTH SENSE and SIGNS, I've come to regard M. Night Shyamalan as the ""Savior of Modern Horror"". He's a brilliant director who takes the offbeat material seriously and always maintains a quality approach to his films. It turns out that THE VILLAGE is not really a bonafide ""horror film,"" though, and it's perhaps best approached with that in mind. I liken it to an overlong TWILIGHT ZONE fantasy television episode that might have been more effective at 30 minutes opposed to its 120. It's beautifully shot with a wholesome feel for the 1800s, and more than a few surprises (the shocking stabbing scene comes to mind). Bryce Howard gives a good performance as the lovestruck blind girl of the story, and William Hurt is strong, too. THE VILLAGE is a flawed movie that isn't on par with THE SIXTH SENSE or SIGNS; it's not a ""great"" film by any means, nor even a ""very good one""... but it works well as a fairytale that plays on people's fears, and I liked that about it.",The Village

82,drystyx,"Good movie, part easy to guess (but in good way), part surprising",9,6 November 2006,"I don't believe anyone could dislike this movie. It has a soft style, and is directed and written with an emphasis on ""Twist"", with a logical sequence which keeps the viewer guessing, but informed. It is probably best described as an actual horror movie, but not one of those ho hum slasher movies of which there are so many it is hard not to be numb to them. Instead, this relies on acting, story telling, writing, and directing, and I dare say it succeeds admirably. In an isolated village (and the viewer keeps wondering why it is isolated, and that is explained little by little), the elders warn the younger members that there are hostile creatures in the forest which won't bother them as long as they stay in the village. There are secrets kept by the elders, but also secrets by some younger people. The writer, director, and others involved in the movie, knew most of us would guess right on the secrets of the elders quite early, so they provided another surprise that was harder to guess at involving the younger generation. On reflection, the viewer is left to wonder whether this was the end result of the decisions of the elders or it would have happened anyway. To say more may spoil the movie, but it has a lot of messages, and a lot of entertainment value, and it is scary in parts, and the characters are all valid and likable (to some extent). I'd be very surprised if someone didn't like this movie. Very well done.",The Village
83,ferbs54,What ARE Maltin And Ebert Talking About?!?!,8,26 April 2017,"On a Monday night, as a sleet/snow storm loomed here in the NYC area, I watched another film from M. Night Shyamalan--my second Shyamalan film in two days, following ""Unbreakable""--and it was another one that I greatly enjoyed: 2004's ""The Village."" In this one, a small, rural, Amish-like community, in what would appear to be the late 19th century, lives in mortal fear of the surrounding forests and the creatures that inhabit it. The writer/director keeps the suspense ratcheted up fairly high throughout, leading to another of his patented surprise/twist endings. Actually, I knew what the ending was before I watched the film; as with ""The Sixth Sense,"" it is almost impossible NOT to have heard about this ending before going in. Still, that did not interfere with my enjoyment of the film, and actually allowed me to marvel out how adroitly the director plays fair with the audience throughout. The picture is gorgeous to look at in high def, and features a most impressive cast of pros: (Ron Howard daughter) Bryce Dallas Howard (whose performance I had enjoyed in the recent ""Jurassic World""), Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Jesse Eisenberg and Brendan Gleeson. I really don't know why this film has been so savaged by critics. Roger Ebert apparently detested the film, putting it on his ""Most Hated"" list, while the Maltin guide calls it ""downright ridiculous."" I suppose that the film is a bit contrived in parts, but that didn't take away from its artful qualities and ability to frighten, for me. Most assuredly recommended!",The Village
84,Enchorde,A true masterpiece,10,7 November 2004,"** HERE BE SPOILERS **An old village, in the end of 19th century, is living under a truce between it and the monsters that live in the surrounding forest. No villager may enter the forest and then no creature from the forest shall enter the village. The village is happy but recently illness has claimed victims and Lucius Hunt (Phoenix) asks permission from the elder council to travel through the forest to fetch medicine from the towns. The council is reluctant and then there are incidents. Animals, killed and skinned are found throughout the village. At first it is thought to be the work of some wild predator, but then the monsters cross the border. Something they have not done for years. At the same time, life in the village must go on, and there are love growing between people, for example between Lucius and the daughter of town elder Edward Walker (Hurt), Ivy (Howard). But such feelings may create envy in others and there are hidden secrets that seemingly no one wants to talk about.This is a great movie, a masterpiece. The story is wonderful. Well thought out and full of details, and it also has several layers, something you can feel but not quite put your finger on. This script is put in to the hands of the cast to act it out. It is cast full of great actors and actresses, Phoenix, Weaver, Howard, Hurt and Brody to name but a few. Especially Howard as the blind girl Ivy, and Brody as the troublesome Noah. Hunt should also be mentioned as the leading elder Edward Walker. But the entire cast is great and do a terrific job. And then back to Shyamalan who do a great job directing it all. The combined effort of everyone makes this a masterpiece to treasure. 10/10",The Village
85,aidanratesmovies,Meh,4,14 October 2020,"Although, I do praise Shyamalan from trying something different than his usual schtick, The Village proves to be as memorable as a dry chicken bone, offering no flavor, despite promising so much. I don't know why I compared this film to a chicken bone, maybe i'm just hungry, but there is sadly nothing truly interesting or of any value throughout this flick. The plot is all over the place, never finding its footing with one character long enough to go onto the next one. It is full of old pioneer era looking clothes, set designs, and cabins- but despite all this style, there is so little substance to come from any of it. I enjoyed the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard tremendously in her role as Ivy Walker, and I thought Joaquin Phoenix and William Hurt did a pretty good job as well. All the other actors prove to be rather overdramatic, overdone, or simply unmemorable. I will give credit to Sigourney Weaver who did provide an interesting performance but whose screen time may dial down tragically to only a couple of minutes. The film is often dull, boring, and simply uninteresting to watch at times. The plot is not only all over the place, but amounts to a series of confusing mixed messages, which are unresolved and leaves you quite frustrated, not to mention, with little left to care about. In the end, The Village could have been a lot more, but instead, it amounted to very little, if not nothing. Its stars were not enough to save it, nor its set direction, and sadly, you will feel more boredom watching this flick than any thrills whatsoever.My Rating: 4/10.",The Village
86,ShootingShark,"Exceptional, Chilling, Suspenseful, Romantic Fable Of Isolated Village Haunted By Monsters",7,24 January 2008,"The inhabitants of an isolated village live in constant fear of monsters which inhabit the surrounding woods and never leave. Ivy, a young blind woman, is in love with Lucius. But when he is stabbed by a rival for her affections, she requests that she leave the village to find medicines in the towns. Can she survive this perilous quest and save Lucius ?I love the timeless quality of Shyamalan's movies; he completely ignores current fashions and as a result his work is the polar opposite of everybody else stylistically. He makes horror movies so they should be full of screaming teens, CGI effects and rock music, but thankfully they're not. This film was made in 2004, but it could have been made in 1954 and it will still be as good in 2054. It eschews cheap thrills and overblown visuals for subtlety, understatement and atmosphere, and is simply brilliant. The scene where Lucius walks a few feet into the woods to pick a berry typifies Shyamalan's genius; it's riveting, scary and exciting, but is all done with one shot, suggestion, sound effects and music. Did we see a monster there ? What happened ? Delicious. The movie takes its time to build the characters so that we know the people and the place intimately when the tension starts to crank up, but at the same time it's constantly teasing us with diversions and hidden meanings, leaving us nervously unsure what to believe. The protagonists of the movie may be archetypes - star-crossed lovers, Village Elder and Village Idiot - but the plot and the people are never conventional; the heroine is blind, the hero gets laid low halfway through, we're never really sure (until the end) whether or not the monsters exist and we make incorrect assumptions about when it's set. The four leads are excellent, notably young Howard in the physically demanding and emotionally complex role of Ivy, with a first-rate larger ensemble. As always in a good horror film, photography and music are crucially important, and this is an exercise in how to do it right. Roger Deakins uses classic techniques to both show and hide the creatures and the whole movie somehow looks as if it was lit naturally (imperative to the story), while James Newton Howard's music quietly growls and scares the pants off us. Shot in lovely lonely locations in rural Pennsylvania, it also features fine costumes by veteran designer Ann Roth. Exceptionally well written, produced and directed by the gifted Shyamalan (who plays the security guard reading a paper), one of the few young directors working who brings real depth, storytelling prowess and classical style to his work and isn't just the usual MTV airhead. Long may he continue to make such breathtaking and entertaining films.",The Village

Going back with a fresh mind, and watching this again, I was given even more hope for a decent film during the opening credits. This film boasts an all-star cast, but it also has Roger Deakins, one of the best cinematographers alive today.

Needless to say, I love the way his films make me think and not to mention that ever present scare factor. But enough about my praises for MKS. The Village, starring Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody among others is two stories in one. The story of life one some know it and life as they have made it known to others.

Anyhow, the story takes place in the dark ages and we come to know the characters are terrified by creatures that live in a nearby forest that come in to town to terrorise and kill once their territory has been breached. Within all this chaos, two major love stories manage to exist; one between Phoenix's character and a blind childhood friend whose sister he had to rebuff, and the other (however unrequited) between Sigourney Weaver's character and the blind girl's father.

94,rosscinema,Despite ending this is still a pretty good mystery,6,22 August 2004,"I know I'm not alone when I say that I knew what the ending was going to be but I still couldn't forget how well made this film was leading up to something fairly predictable. I hope future viewers will ignore what the others are saying about this and judge it for themselves and see that it's an effective mystery. Story is about a village that is deep in the woods where the inhabitants raise livestock and farm and live by a set of common rules which includes that no one ever sets foot in the woods surrounding their village. They have a truce with the creatures that live in the forest where they both respect each others borders but the people still have round the clock watches in towers just in case the alarm is needed. The village is run by Edward Walker (William Hurt) who keeps things running by consulting with the elders on issues at hand. Edward's daughter is Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is blind but still very strong willed and she is in love with Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) who petitions for a chance to venture into the woods.*****SPOILER ALERT*****The village idiot named Noah (Adrien Brody) is also in love with Ivy and he stabs Lucius badly which leaves him on deaths door and desperately needing medicine to combat the infection he has acquired. Ivy tells her father Edward that she will go get the medicine from the town but first he confides in her about the secret of the creatures.
M. Night Shyamalan directed this and shows his usual gifts as a storyteller such as well written characters, deliberate pacing, and of course the twist ending and while I understand that many did not care for this I am still recommending it because everything leading up to the ending is very well done. One of the best things about Shyamalan's films is the taut editing that keeps viewers guessing and occasionally jumping out of their seats and this is no different. The editing reminds me a lot of how Clint Eastwood edits his films in that every scene is significant and every shot has meaning which is why his films are still fun to watch a second and third time. Howard as Ivy gives an inspired performance and their were times when some of the lines of dialogue she recites sounds a lot like poetry especially when talking about seeing the world in her own way. I do admit that I knew what kind of ending was coming up and it's no fun to figure something like that out but I was intrigued when one of the creatures pops up later in the film. Also, one can't dismiss Hurt's character sending his blind daughter into the woods when he probably could have gone himself. This is a glaringly strange moment in the story that I think hurts the film and with the ending I can understand the viewers frustration. This is not one of Shyamalan's best efforts but it's still a good mystery and like ""Signs"" it possesses some truly eerie and nerve wracking moments.",The Village

We both loved ""The Sixth Sense"" so much than when ""Unbreakable"" was released, we rushed to see it on the opening weekend. We liked it but not as much as TSS. After we saw ""Signs"", we both decided that we were not going to see Shyamalan's movies in the theater. We waited for ""The Village"" DVD and managed not to know anything about the big twist in the end. To make the long story short, he did not like ""The Village"" and would watch the next Shyamalan's movie when it comes on the network. As for me, I went from dismissal - ""where on earth did he hear people talk like that?"" to ""is this guy as retarded as Brody's character?"" to ""he sure knows how to make a nice looking film"" to ""hey, it is not a horror movie at all"", to ""the idea is really interesting and goes way beyond this movie"" to ""if he only had a sense of humor and did not take his films so seriously"" to ""if only the final result would match the original idea"" - and here where I finally stay. I keep thinking about the film and I find it intriguing, interesting but flawed and often laughable where it did not mean to be. That's what Shyamalan misses, IMO - all his heroes are the pale lifeless shadows, life seems to be drawn out of them. In some of his films, it works, but most of the time, I could care less what happens to them. Besides, even his avid fans mention holes in the plot, and huge ones, I assure you. The whole concept of ""The Village"" is holding on the girl's blindness. Take it away and what do you have? The nice cinematography and music, the good actors who had not much to play, the Brody's character who made me laugh hysterically every time he was on the screen and I don't believe that was the writer/director's intentions, the moody atmosphere (again, I've been in his atmosphere, all his films have it), and sometimes, ridiculous dialogs. I think, I will wait for the next Shyamalan's film's DVD and I believe ""The Village"" is better than ""Signs"" but inferior to ""The Sixth Sense"". I also believe that he was on the top of his game when he told the story of one little boy's struggle with his gift/curse and not when he tries to embrace the global problems.

96,nycritic,"The Woods are Scary, but This is a Snoozefest.",2,2 March 2005,"How does one write an intelligent, coherent review of a movie that made me feel like I was not only cheated, but done so at a shameless way? M. Night Shyamalan has, for the last three out of five movies, focused on making sci-fi/horror films that rely on only one thing: a fantastic twist at or near the movie's climax or critical point, which of course, would make you, the viewer, do a double-take and applaud him for doing something so breath-taking and original that it would, in itself, trump the big revelation in VERTIGO (1957) or the final big denouement scene in WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (also 1957). With THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) he had a honest hit, a revelation of a movie director with talent to spare, but once he made SIGNS (2002), it was clear the cheap twist is all he is about.What can one do when one has to listen to the most God-awful dialog in recent film history? Judy Greer, whom I've seen in movies of varying quality and the TV series ""Arrested Development,"" decides to proclaim her love for Joaquin Phoenix with an intensity that rivals that of Peter Finch's speech (take your pick, there are at least five) as Howard Beale in NETWORK (1976), but since here her lines are so horrible, it's unintentionally funny. As a matter of fact, everyone speaks in that odd pilgrim-like choice of words and utters sentences like, ""What is your meaning"" and ""I know that thing that is in your head"" as if it were written by Paddy Chayefsky or Joseph Mankiewicz or even Shakespeare. It is done so totally deadpan that it becomes painful to watch and more than once I looked at the time to see how much more I would have to endure, because when a story like this is devoid of even a slight bit of humor and is equally pointless, actions must be taken.For a director to state that he has been influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, there has to be some proof in his work. Choices of takes and scenes, choices of actors/actresses, choices of stories to tell, music, among other things. Shyamalan may say he is influenced by (Hitchcock) all he wants but if he is so, I can't see it. The use of red here -- an important part of the story -- has been done masterfully by Hitchcock in the aforementioned VERTIGO (1957) and MARNIE (1964), and better still by Ingmar Bergman's CRIES AND WHISPERS (1972). Also, Hitchcock was The Master of Suspense: he gave us enough information for us to know what is happening at the moment, and then cranked up the mounting intensity to a fever pitch like the masterful Albert Hall sequence in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (1956) or the scene in NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) where Cary Grant is left waiting for his ride in the middle of a cornfield and slowly but surely, a plane materializes. We know there is something about to happen, just not what, or if it will actually take place.Sadly enough, there is zero suspense here. The events that take place in Covington, PA, fail to cause any sort of empathy or reaction, and the only real scene that introduces danger about to strike a major character seems so contrived it begs for a reason to exist. Why would Bryce Dallas Howard stand at the threshold extending her arm outward when it is clear there are things out there in the dark? Because the plot had her do so, not because there was a need for it.So many ways to have told this story and genuinely introduce the twist without cheating the audience with holes as large as the ozone layer for the convenience and whims of the ""plot."" Shyamalan decides to cop out, waste some good talent (or, if seen differently, use high profile names like Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, and Adrien Brody fresh out of his Oscar win, to ensure viewers), make some easy money, cash on his new-found fame, and produce a hat-trick that doesn't have a rabbit and basically gives no new insights. And that is a sad thing for a director to do, if he purportedly is to consider himself serious.And one last thing: Shyamalan needs to take his name off the title of the movie, since he is not at the stature of a Kubrick or the aforementioned Hitchcock. He needs a little lesson in humility and return to making actual movies, not travesties.",The Village

It's interesting to notice how the love between father and son/daughter is unconditional in this film as it is (or should be) in real life. Edward Walker risked everything in that village to pursuit the real happiness of his daughter, even thought nobody supported his decision. The fear from the unknown is another thing that this movie portrays like in real life. Put yourselves in the place of them. If you were born there, and everyone told you that there was no life out there, would you not believe? How would you know if you don't have opportunity to leave?

98,Kamurai25,"""Blind Yellow Riding Hood""",8,27 September 2020,"Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.Being this is in the Shamallama-verse, it catches a lot of flak for having a ""twist"", and being a bit of a intellectual weight lift, but even knowing the ""twist"", I find it to be a very interesting watch.A blind protagonist is immediately interesting to me because it tends to lend itself to the non-traditional elements of a movie and is usually very refreshing for those of us that watch a lot of movies.Bryce Dallas Howard, especially, does much of the heavy lifting in this movie, but there really is a stacked cast that all give a good amount of quality support through their roles: it's not just about the blind girl travelling for days through the woods, it is about the community. Stories that focus on things larger than a single person as a ""character"" tend to lose people as they like to immerse themselves in a character and still feel they're bigger than the world in the setting.The initial concept of a ""big bad wolf"" in the woods is interesting, but they do go a different way with it: they're almost a society of creatures the way they're given to behave where werewolves might have actually been a more effective choice for a ""monster"".Likely this has been spoiled for you, but if not, then you should definitely give it a shot, and if so, then you should see how it is for yourself.",The Village
99,Rob_Taylor,The Adventures of Super Blind Girl!,5,5 December 2005,"Yeesh! What a dull and completely predictable movie this was! I'll admit, the opening fifteen minutes or so had promise, but it very quickly becomes apparent what is going on and what WILL happen at the end. The only real surprise moment was when the retard knifes the boyfriend of super blind girl. And, at that precise moment, any last vestiges of mystery evaporate like spilt petrol from a hot forecourt.In essence, The Village tries to be a clever movie that will ""shock"" its audience with the revealed ""truths"". In reality, even Western Union would have trouble matching the telegraphing that goes on here! I mean, they don't just drop subtle clues, its bloody great sledgehammer-like obvious ones.In a nutshell, this is the story...A small community of (apparently) turn of the century/late 1800's folk live in mortal fear of ""Those we do not speak of"" (tm) who live beyond the boundaries of their community. As a result, they never leave the community. The Elders tell everyone that the world outside is wicked. However, when someone is hurt, everything begins to ""unravel"" and someone has to be sent for medical help.So here's the thing. Nobody leaves the community, but apparently everyone knows there is a town nearby. Despite the fear of ""Those we do not speak of"" (tm) - of which they seem to do nothing but talk - it's difficult to imagine that someone wouldn't have tried by now and succeeded.Because of the aforementioned ""subtle"" clues, it becomes apparent early on that the whole thing is a sham and that there are no real monsters. Likewise, it also is equally apparent that the ""wicked world"" outside is actually the modern day world. However, fear not, for the real surprise is actually that the supposed retard is a lunatic prepared to commit murder.After about thirty minutes nothing really comes as much of a surprise anymore and you're left looking at your watch/DVD counter etc. and wondering how much longer it can be dragged out for. The answer is another hour, during which we are treated to the ridiculous concept of a blind girl being sent out to fetch medicines for her sick boyfriend whom the retard stabbed. Of course, she succeeds, along the way handily dispatching the retard to his doom at the bottom of a pit. The end.Things that insulted me about this movie: The blind girl who acted like she was not blind and could handily navigate through a forest she'd never been in before and then back again. Blind people are capable at getting around, but I doubt orienteering is high on their list of ""must do"" activities. Gah!The conceit behind the victims who set up the community. How ironic, intentional or otherwise, that those who had been the victims of crime should choose to persecute their own children and force them to live away from modern society, medicines and services. To such an extreme that they would be willing to let people die rather than go the few miles to fetch help. Bah! M Night Shyamalan.... it's becoming rapidly apparent to me that Mr Night wants us to think he's a cool, cutting-edge kind of director. A Spielberg or Cameron, or even a Burton. The reality is, he's mediocre at best and good upon occasion. The top-notch director class that he wants us to think he belongs in is as believable as most of his movies. In other words, a complete fantasy, a conceit of his own mind. He can make some effective films, but frequently ignores that which makes a movie entertaining in favour of ""clever"" plot twists which the audience has foreseen long before. As a result, his movies are never shocking or surprising, just formulaic and dull.Summary: This would make a good episode of the Outer Limits or Twilight Zone, but instead is drawn out into a movie that should never have been.EDIT: It was gratifying to see Robot Chicken mock Mr. Shyamalan. Thanks Seth Green!",The Village
100,moviewizguy,Don't Listen to the Critics,10,24 November 2006,"There is a small, isolated countryside village that is in the forest. They believe that there are mythical creatures that inhabit the forest around them. They align with them, but never making any contact with them. Now, the villagers believe that their alliance is coming to an end.Many of the critics say this is a very bad film. Forget about them. They're wrong. Many people watch this film to look for clues for the twist ending. That's their mistake. Don't look for clues. See this film as if this weren't made by M. Night Shyamalan. See this film like any other film you would see it.Everyone in this film gives Oscar-worthy performances with an all star cast, including Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver. The acting is excellent.The score of the film is very good, composed by Thomas Newton Howard, composing all of M. Night Shyamalan's films. The trailer is misleading. This isn't a horror type film. It's more like a suspense and a love story. That's probably why many didn't like this film.This is one of M. Night Shyamalan's best films. The film is well done and has a great cast playing solid performances. It's very touching and suspenseful. If you want to watch this film because of the twist ending, don't waste your time.

101,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""The Village""- The beginning of M. Night Shyamalan's fall. Fascinating ideas and genuinely eerie set-pieces brought down by a meandering pace and contrived eccentricity.",6,6 July 2017,"The career of M. Night Shyamalan has been a fascinating and harrowing thing to follow over the past twenty years. His explosive success with 1999's ""The Sixth Sense"" was something of a revelation, and it rocketed him to super-stardom in the annals of film history. After following it up with two films I feel are equal in every way to that iconic and indisputable classic in the form of contemplative superhero drama ""Unbreakable"" and the mind-warping alien-invasion thriller ""Signs"", Shyamalan could do no wrong as far as many were concerned. Little did we know what the near future would hold, and just how far he would fall before finding rebuilding himself back up. In some ways, it could be argued that 2002's ""Signs"" was the last truly great Shyamalan thriller we'd get until 2017's remarkable and brilliantly entertaining ""Split.""And for many people, it was his fourth major release, the period- piece supernatural thriller ""The Village"", that signaled the start of his downfall. While by no means a terrible film and benefiting from sharp direction and strong performances, ""The Village"" is where the confident idea that Shyamalan always knew exactly what he was doing began to crack. On one hand... yeah, it had a lot of the things that we ate up in his previous efforts. The quirky characters, the bone-chilling horror... and yet, it was starting to feel a bit stale. Often feeling like someone else trying to imitate Shyamalan's style than an actual Shyamalan feature. His previously careful, deliberate pacing and focus was starting to feel aimless and meandering. His idiosyncratic humor and peculiar characters began to feel contrived and shoehorned. And his oft- shocking twists and turns became shallow and predictable. Now don't get me wrong... ""The Village"" does have a lot to offer thanks to the elements that do work and on the whole I think the film is enjoyable. But it's still a massive step in the wrong direction. In the 19th century, in the village of Covington reside a small and tightly knit community of families, who all live in fear of the treacherous creatures who stalk the woods around them at night- ""Those we don't speak of."" In order to maintain balance, a set of rules has been crafted to keep everyone safe. Two young villagers- Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) and the blind Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) admit their attraction to one-another and intend on marrying. However, their happy news comes at a cost, when their close friend, the mentally-challenged Noah Percy (Adrien Brody) cannot accept their love and attempts to murder Lucius in a fit of jealous rage. After pleading with village elders, Ivy is given a chance to help her love- she is permitted to enter the Covington woods and try to navigate past the devious monsters that populate it, so that she can obtain medicine from the next town over to try and save Lucius. However, her journey will bring about revelations regarding Covington and the men and women who populate it... revelations that may threaten to destroy the once- strong community.The greatest strengths of the film lie in its exquisite beauty from a production standpoint, in addition to the generally stellar performances of our three main leads. This is one very good-looking and sounding movie, with some of the sharpest camera-work and jaw- droppingly gorgeous music of any Shyamalan feature. The visual guidance is top-notch from start to finish, and Shyamalan is able to paint a dark and troubled portrait of a town haunted with his stunning storytelling. James Newton Howard's score rightfully earned an Oscar nod, and it's some of his best- complimented by the expert violinist Hilary Hahn, who performs a great deal of work on the score. Our three leads in Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrian Brody are all absolutely incredible in their respective roles and will immediately earn great admiration from the viewer. Particularly Howard, who gives one of the best performances of her career in this film. Unfortunately, the supporting cast is mixed, with some of the actors including William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver feeling woefully underutilized and out of place.And unfortunately, as I mentioned above, this is the film where Shyamalan begins to go a bit too far with his material, at times making the film feel like a borderline self-satire. I almost get the feeling that the film was rushed into production without a second draft having been written, because it all feels a bit sloppy. Shyamalan's quirky characters are there... but they're a bit more stale and a bit less defined. The focus and pacing is methodical and deliberate... and yet all too often the film begins to feel tedious and overwrought. Rules are established and ideas introduced... and yet the film does little with the concepts presented, lacking payoff. And without spoiling anything, anyone who is aware of Shyamalan's penchant for introducing game-changing twists into his finales will be able to see what's coming from a mile away. In a lot of ways, the movie feels like its slaving to try and be the next great Shyamalan film by trying to repeat what he does well. But it's not organic. It's a bit too cold and clinical. Even robotic. It's like a computer wrote the film based on a Shyamalan algorithm. The ideas are there... but the humanity is lacking.""The Village"" is a troubled film. And it is the movie that signals the start of the dark age for the promising filmmaker behind it. And yet, the stellar performances, sharp visual storytelling and absolutely gorgeous musical score are able to salvage and indeed save the film from imploding. It's not a great film... it's probably not even a good film. But it's solid enough that I'd recommend it to open-minded viewers. It might not be the classic that ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" became. But it's adequate. I give it an ever-so-slightly above average 6 out of 10.",The Village
102,Luigi Di Pilla,Average Mystery Thriller,5,28 May 2006,"Well, I'm happy that I didn't pay any cent for this one because I had the occasion to watch it by friends on DVD. I am disappointed that I waited more than 30 minutes until something happens but even then I was asking myself if I should continue to watch or stop it. Sometimes I had the impression to see THE SIGNS with the same sceneries. I have to admit that the director and the same writer had a good idea sending a clear message to the audience. I am surprised how his movies continues to top the 100 Mio. US$ at the US Box Office. In this case I prefer therefore THE PASSION OF THE Christ that contains more emotional elements with a more beautiful scenery. After the disappointing UNBREAKABLE, THE SIGNS and THE VILLAGE the director should finally create better movies such as his best one called THE SIXTH SENSE. His last works seemed to be tired and he should now stop to write and in the same time to produce his own projects. For all these reasons I give 5/10. Definitely not a must see.",The Village
103,valadas,Evasion,7,10 November 2004,"A few people (The Elders) decided to evade this world of crime, anguish and pain and found a community in a secluded place surrounded by woods where they lead a life of peace, purity, love and quietness, dressing like 100 years ago and dispensing with such niceties as electrical power, cinema, radio, TV and motor cars. The way how they managed to get into this remains unrevealed to the viewer until the end of the movie and even then it doesn't become 100% clear. Well but what could be an Eden-like life is spoiled on the one hand by the belief that no one can go out of the village and cross the woods that surround it because they are inhabited by strange hostile creatures who will not only kill those who dare to do it but will also attack the village and on the other hand because human passions cannot be suppressed with all the distress they can cause and even jealousy and crime. This leads us to the vexed question of knowing if the solution for the evils of modern society lie in the evasion to supposed retired paradises where in spite of that, drama will be always present because the freer men are more drama will take place in their lives. And what to do when crime happens or the illness comes and you don't have the adequate means of dealing with it? But this story is indeed well told and homogeneous in narrative terms and will rivet your attention. Bryce Dallas Howard has a superb performance in the part of the blind girl who courageously faces danger in order to save the life of the man she loves.

104,MartianOctocretr5,"Twilight Zone type story, but slow in telling it",5,17 November 2006,"The underlying premise of this story has been addressed before, as long ago as Twilight Zone, and would have been better off in a shorter format like the Zone. The movie has some merit, but because of the feature length duration of the film to get across its single idea, the movie drags quite a bit.There's a lot of stylish smoke and mirrors, promising but rarely delivering a cache of meat and potatoes substance behind them. One example is the focus on devising unique camera angles and movements, and they are innovative, but what you see is not really telling a story. For example, the frantic turns from left to right reminded me of a Driver's Ed instruction video more than a movie. In one case, the character making these looks to the left and right was supposed to be blind, making these movements even more distracting as glaring plot holes. Another problem was how the film prolonged certain things unnecessarily, such as how the townspeople banter over who will go on a mission to obtain something. They argue over this issue seemingly forever, until I could almost hear Rod Serling turn over in his grave and yell for the film to get on with it.The acting really isn't bad, but hardly anybody is given much to do, except Bryce Howard, and her frightened, winsome, innocent character is played well. The period linguistic styles were useful, but the lines seemed strained at times. Also, the speeches add to making the already obvious ""secret twist"" even more predictable. The mysterious and rarely seen forest creatures are utilized well for their function in the story.The movie endeavors to make a point, and to some extent, it succeeds. It just labors to get there. If you're expecting horror or suspense from this movie, you will be disappointed. If you like Twilight Zone/X Files type material, you may find some value in it.",The Village
105,DJAkin,Sasquatch meets Johnny Cash,6,22 July 2006,"This movie had it all, monsters, retards and blind cuties. What it didn't have was anything scary. This movie revolved around some throwbacks from the 1700's who live life in peace and there is a Sasquatch that scares them all. This sasquatch is very different in that it has claws that can tear you apart. In one scene, Bigfoot is running around in the forest and the kids try to test how BRAVE they are by standing on a platform and taunting the yetti. I won't reveal what happened. All I can say is that there were torches lit on fire for a special effect. The yetti turns out to be much more than we expect. To say that there is a twist in this film is a gross understatement. You will never look at Sasquatch again in the same way after seeing this movie. I would kick bigfoot out of the village if he came to my town.",The Village
106,KUAlum26,"More spook than spark,perhaps",7,4 November 2005,"I'm gonna try to not give away any spoilers here. I'll just say that I liked this movie. I am somewhat of a fan of Mr.Shymalan(spelling?)'s films,and while ""Village"" would not rank as my fave--that distinction would belong to ""Unbreakbale""--I still thought this movie was not bad at all. Excellent mood and tension is built up throughout,regardless of how you felt about the show.In rural Western Pennsylvania,some time during the 19th century,a small village lives a quiet,peaceful but somewhat tenuous existence as it speaks in hushed tones of the ""creature or creatures"" in the neighboring woods. When one of the younger members of the community(Juaquin Phoenix,very well-placed here)decides to go out into said woods,this sets the fearful community into a stir as the elders(led by William Hurt,perfect for this film!)try to decide whether to sanction this or not. This sets into motion a series of events that FORCES the village to send somebody into the forest and confront the danger.An excellent breakthrough performance by Bryce Dallas HOward,as the blind daughter of Hurt's elder,heads this cast,which also features Judy Greer,Adrien Brody,Sigourney Weaver and Celia Weston(among others). Careful hints are dropped during this movie to clue the viewer,which,depending on your tolerance for ""twist"" endings,may or may not color your whole opinion of the film. Still,I,personally would recommend it,mostly as a sort of ""Old-fashioned campfire scare story"" put to celluloid. 7.5 out of 10.",The Village
107,Cosmoeticadotcom,Yawn,4,21 September 2008,"I seem to be the only person who recognizes how poorly written M. Night Shyamalan's films are. Is it because I'm a Hitchcock aficionado? No. I just have an ability to read narrative arcs and see where things are going. It was obvious that Bruce Willis was dead in The Sixth Sense, that Samuel L. Jackson was the bad guy in Unbreakable, and that, well, Signs sucked altogether. Perhaps I demand too much, ot perhaps it's because I see in MNS a burgeoning Spike Lee or Steven Spielberg- i.e.- someone with a great eye but no knack for storytelling. My advice: become a cinematographer, or write better tales! This, especially, goes out to MNS, since he writes his films, and all are 'twist ' films- dependent upon that final reveal.This film had potential to be as great a work of art as that other great fictive The Village- from the 1967 TV show The Prisoner, but it fails miserably on all levels. MNS wouldn't know a well-written script if you beat him with it. Am I repeating myself? Let me range a little more- I am tired of mere cinematographers posing as auteurs. Learn narrative arcs. Perhaps I do expect too much- like character development, plausible plots, etc. and tales not based on a twist, but situations that logically and/or organically grow out of situation.Yet, a quick review of professional critics' reviews was astounding, for most seemed to miss that this was a film not set in the 19th Century- instead believing that some time tripping had occurred. As for the extras? There's no commentary, thankfully, for the featurettes are fellatric enough- including a heinous diary by Bryce Howard, and an execrable bit of another of MNS's bad home movies from childhood. He seems to put far more care into his childhood films selected for the DVDs than he does his actual grown up films. In short, MNS delivers another film with a good premise, but lousy execution in all aspects. I've given up on him as a film director, but I'm sure he's got his next twist film already in the works. (Sigh!)",The Village
108,BrandtSponseller,One of Shyamalan's Best Films,10,6 February 2005,"The Village is set in a small, rural community living in a kind of 19th Century self-supporting agrarianism. Woods surround the town, and the villagers maintain a strict perimeter, as there are creatures in the woods with whom they've reached a truce so long as the borders are not breached. Tension mounts as the creatures start breaking their normal pattern, and one of the villagers, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), seeks permission from the town elders to travel through the woods, to the towns and ""those we don't speak of"", so he can acquire medicine for his fellow villagers.For anyone seriously interested in the art of film, The Village is worth a viewing just for its cinematography and score. That's not to say that the story isn't good. It's a captivating tale of a very odd small town, complete with a twist, as is characteristic of director M. Night Shyamalan. The twist may not be as shattering here as it was in some of his previous films, such as The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000), but it is still a change that catalyzes an eye-opening recontextualization and reassessment of the previous material, making the film and the final resolution of the story even more poignant. It is also interesting to note the many possible metaphorical readings, ranging from political insularism to religion, or even more literal comparisons to social and geographic segregation (from ethnic enclaves to gated communities).Shyamalan could be said to have a directorial gimmick, although that might not be the best word because it's usually taken negatively, and I don't mean it to undervalue his approach. He makes genre films in the guise of realist dramas. So far, all of his films since he hit it big with The Sixth Sense have used this interesting device, each in a different genre. The Sixth Sense was a horror/ghost story. Unbreakable was a comic book film. Signs was sci-fi. The Village is fantasy/adventure. It also has some horror elements (as do Unbreakable and Signs).Part of Shyamalan's genius as a filmmaker is that he can achieve the usual responses associated with those genres using such unusual, relatively mundane and realist material. For example, in The Village, he is able to build up an incredible amount of suspense in relation to two very simple things--flowers of a particular color, and beginning a walk into the woods. A simple walk into the woods is also the beginning of an adventure just as grand as any depiction of a quest for the Holy Grail, say. And the ensuing plot developments, although very ordinary on one level, have a profound, redemptive effect. Many of the most important developments in the climax aren't even directly stated; they're just subtly implied in what we're shown, yet they all work extremely well. While Shyamalan's style may require some adjustments for viewers more accustomed to chaotic, MTV-paced genre films, or on the flipside, for viewers less accustomed to elements of fantasy in their films, it is worth altering your preconceptions about pacing and content.The cast is excellent. I'm not usually the biggest fan of William Hurt, but I even loved his performance. Joaquin Phoenix and particularly Bryce Dallas Howard are amazing. The film wouldn't have worked without the right person in either actor's roles. Both were perfect choices. There is also a wonderful, very slight surreal quality throughout most of the film shown in the behavior of the villagers towards each other.James Newton Howard's score may be his best to date in a very long list of credits. The music always provides just the right atmosphere, sense of wonder/mystery, pathos and suspense. Roger Deakins' cinematography is equally brilliant, capturing a slight eeriness, sense of foreboding and comfort all at the same time, and with an ingenious use of colors. Much of the film leans towards rich yellow/orange hues and tints, with strong green accents in the grasses and trees. Whenever red is introduced, it is appropriately intense. The framing of shots and staging of scenes is equally impressive.I know that this film has had its detractors, but I cannot see why. For my tastes, The Village is yet another masterpiece from a very creative, innovative filmmaker.",The Village
109,areatw,Completely forgettable with an underwhelming twist,4,7 November 2019,"Firstly, 'The Village' isn't a horror film and I'm not sure why it was marketed as such. There's no scares, no gore, nothing at all that resembles horror. Describing it as a thriller is a bit of a stretch too as the 'thrills' are virtually non-existent. This is a drama film and a boring one at that. It's painfully slow and uneventful with a dull bunch of characters and a rather forgettable storyline.After sitting through such a drab 60 minutes or so, you at least expect an ending that packs a punch and makes the rest of the film feel worthwhile. Unfortunately, for me at least, the 'twist' ending was a big let-down. It was unexpected, but just because I didn't see it coming didn't make it any less of a disappointment. 'The Village' is just about watchable, but there's not much point when there are far more effective thrillers out there to watch instead.",The Village
110,baumer,Almost as bad as Lady in the Water,3,25 June 2008,"There have been a plethora of opinions espoused about The Village. Some positive, some negative, and some very ambivalent. There are those that love this film and others call it the antithesis to what made Shyamalan famous revered by critics and film lovers. The difficulty in reviewing a film like The Village is that there is an incredibly fine line between reviewing the film in terms of how well it was made and reviewing the film in terms of how utterly contemptible it is towards it's target audience. The first question you have to ask yourself is if this is a well-made film? Sure, it is competently made, it is well acted and it is scored nicely. If you look at it that way, then The Village is a well-made film. But if what you are looking for in a film is something more sophisticated and shrewd from a man like Shyamalan, then The Village is an abomination. It is nothing but a charlatan that when viewing the film I thought I mistakenly heard Shyamalan was the man behind this film. To cut to the chase, this is one of the worst films of 2004 only being surpassed thus far by the universally accepted fetidness of Catwoman. The Village in some ways is worse than Catwoman because it tricks you into believing that you are about to see one movie when you are really in store for another. The Village goes into new depths of purgatory from a marketing standpoint. When filmmakers and studios can lie to you about what you are to see, then we have reached a new low in the art and business of film. I didn't go into Alien vs. Predator expecting to see a story about aristocracy of Old England and I didn't go into The Village expecting to see nothing but a nostrum of monumental proportions. While Catwoman is a poorly made film by a man with one name, The Village is almost worse because Shyamalan is synonymous with the pinnacle of the craft. Regrettably, The Village is nowhere near brilliant. Sadly, it's almost at the other end of the axis. The Village is terrible.The Village begins with the townsfolk attending a funeral of one of the young boys of The Village. He was seven years old and by the engraving on his gravestone, we can see that the film takes place in the very late 1800's. The Villagers are a very simple and peaceful people and they keep to themselves. They refute any outside influence and have chosen to live in seclusion. This seems to work for them and the nearest town is miles away. They farm, they dance, and they live in a harmonious concord . But of course there is one problem; the uneasy truce they have with the entities in the woods. There has been an ostensible truce between the villagers and the entities in the woods for years and their kinds do not mix. The villagers stay out of the woods and the entities stay out of the village. There are certain precautions that must be taken by the villagers that include a watchtower that is occupied at night and the color red must never be seen by the entities in the woods as it apparently attracts and angers the woodsmen. Harmony is omnipotent in the village until suddenly animals are found skinned and when one of the villagers has gone into the woods. The village's remuneration for their pretentious and defying act is a midnight visit by the beasts. Everyone runs for cover and this is the one and only moment of laconic tension. By this point in the film, it has crawled along at a snail's pace and we are ripe for some Carpenteresque type of tension. When this finally transpires, we think that the film is ready to take us into the realm of ambiguity that consistently graces Shyamalan's films. But what transpires next is a mendaciously misleading series of events that can do nothing to disguise the machination that Shyamalan set out with in the first place. We thought were walking into a horror film that would make the hair stand on the back of your neck, the way Sixth Sense did and the way that Signs did sporadically. But what we get instead is nothing but a quack job that cons us out of our money. Shyamalan is synonymous with ""twist endings"". To borrow a line from Spiderman, that is his gift to us and also his curse. With great power comes great responsibility and Night has abused that power. He might have had noble intentions when he wrote this film as many have discussed the symbolism of the red flags and bad colors and the implied danger inherent in this film, and if that is what you enjoy, a subliminal film that lectures us and works as a parable, then by all means, pay your ten bucks and go see this film. But if you were hoping to be enthralled by an ostensible master of modern suspense and horror, then you are going to be disappointed. Shyamalan has given us nothing but an amateurish picture so engrossed in sanctimonious and implied admonitions that he forgot to make the film entertaining and suspenseful. The Village is one of the most absurd films loaded with esoterica and it is ultimately a colossal failure. The ""twist"" in the film produced gales of laughter from the theater I was in and it carried over as the audience left the theater. For a sheer waste of money, see The Village. For a film that had such pedigree to it, it is one of the all time disappointments. The Village takes several steps back for a man of Shyamalan's stature and reputation. Let's hope the next M. Night Shyamalan film is better than the last two because his statute of limitations on creating disappointing films just dropped significantly.3/10",The Village

Ivy was the one to go. She went with two young guys but they left him because they're scared and they thought the monsters would take pity on her because she couldn't see. She knew monsters were a lie because her father showed the monster costumes with red cloaks in the shed that's not used. But one of those monsters chased her anyway and she made it fell into the deep pit that she just managed to get out. It was Noah. He found another costume under the floors of the silent room in which he was prisoned. He climbed over a wall and encountered a modern man with a modern car. The guy was protecting the wildlife area surrounded by a wall. He fetched her some medicine and she managed to get back. They were living in the modern world. It resulted in such a meaningless situation where everything is a lie all those monster and the age but still I very much enjoyed it. The beginning set the tone very well with those yellow cloaks vs. The forbidden color red, the watch tower, the unknown dangers lurking in the woods, skinned animals and most importantly the characters of Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver and Bryce Dallas Howard. They opened the secret chest of Alice (Sigourney Weaver) and there were photos from their previous lives in the towns where they got somehow hurt and took refuge in the wilderness.",The Village
113,sarastro7,"I know what I like, but I don't know if it's art...",6,29 September 2004,"(Spoilers)The Village is one weird movie. It has loads and loads of subtext and symbolism. The ""dangerous"" color, red, which has to be buried, signifies some form of passion. The ""safe"", ""protective"" color, yellow, signifies cowardice.While the movie's message isn't striking while you watch it, in retrospect it does seem to be about a society (the U.S.) of fear, conservatism and manipulation - but apparently that status quo is just maintained at the end.This is a movie that has ""art"" written all over it, but it doesn't come through on it. It could have gone in lots and lots of brilliant directions, but it doesn't. On the face of it, it gives the impression of ending up vindicating Christian conservatism and nature romanticism; justifying cowardly people's flight from the real world. Very strange. That cannot be the final message, surely!Consequently one must conclude that Shyamalan has plenty of artistic intentions and ambitions, but he keeps so tight a lid on them that they end up having hardly any effect - it was really the same with Signs. In other words, he is too careful. He wants to say something progressive and radical, but can't solidify the message well enough to produce a well-rounded piece of meaningful movie-making. That's sad.Of course, I might be wrong. Maybe there'll be an extended version later which makes a lot more sense. This theatrical version I can only rate 6 out of 10, because despite other virtues it just does not make sense on a symbolical level (the level on which the movie is obviously meant to be primarily understood). But, maybe it's one of those movies that one has to think about for a long time and watch several times before one ""gets it"".I'd like to mention the acting as well. Much of the movie was delightful to watch because many performances are extremely good. It is natural to single out Bryce Dallas Howard, who shines through as an intelligent, mature and sensitive actress who will certainly be among tomorrow's greatest Hollywood talents.",The Village
114,emasterslake,I rather watch Twilight Zone,4,2 July 2006,"Just saw it recently, and here are my thoughts.Story takes place at an old fashion village, where the people are forbidden to leave and forbidden to use red.Due to the sightings of the so called ""forbidden to mention"" monsters.Strange stuff happens during the nights such as animals being skinned and murders.The villagers question the elders, but they know nothing and suggested that they were done by carnivores like wolves or coyotes. But there's something that they know that the villagers don't know.The first 15 minutes are very slow. It took awhile for some real suspense to happen. Up to an OK start, but it really stank at the end.If you seen it you'll be confused and questioned at the same time.In my opion i could of had done a better job with the story. At least something as good as Twilight Zone.I couldn't bare watching it again. My advice rent it if you like confusing suspense movies but just don't expect it to be great.",The Village

116,ODDBear,Disappointing,5,30 August 2004,"I assume you've read the storyline elsewhere, so I'll skip it.I was profoundly disappointed by this movie.  Shyamalan has shown himself to be a unique and utterly capable director (Sixth Sense, Signs) but also not infallible (the utterly boring Unbreakable).  Here he is on Unbreakable territory.  He completely indulges himself in every little thing, assuming the viewer is so captivated in what he has to say here, which in the end is nothing special at all.  Worst of all, he has little flashbacks of dialouge near the end, telling us that ""intelligent viewers"" could have figured out the plot.  What's most irritating is that I get the feeling he crams these surprise twists just for the sake of surprise twists.  He did it brilliantly with The Sixth Sense, but here, it seems idiotic.  But to say this movie is bad is not a fair assessment.  Shyamalan is very good at creating a moody athmosphere and he can create genuine suspense out of almost nothing.  He makes me jump out of my seat a few times, with well timed shocks (maybe he should make a full blown horror film).  But when the end result is anything but interesting, what preceeds it seems somehow a cheat, a false buildup. The packaging looks good, but there's no substance.Another plus are the performances.  William Hurt is excellent, it's always nice to see Sigourney Weaver and Phoenix is his usual good, but somehow sterotypical, self.  5 out of 10.",The Village

118,vip_ebriega,"Either you love it, or you hate it.",8,19 March 2007,"My Take: Some will be let down by how Shymalan plays with audience's expectations, but it's sometimes a poignant and interesting film.I have long since been a defender of M. Night Shymalan's THE VILLAGE. Sure, I too didn't get it the first time, yet it grew into me several viewings later. Ever since, it has been an intriguing if imperfect excursion. But the fact that it doesn't really appeal to everyone makes THE VILLAGE all the more open to debate, and more inviting to revisit. So I looked back on this excursion and realized how interesting, if still flawed, film it is. Whether or not the film is a misunderstood masterpiece or a terribly misguided ""personal"" effort, it never fails to be worth of scrutiny. M. Night Shyamalan remains one of Hollywood's most misunderstood directors in Hollywood, famous for many modern horror films like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"". In this, one of his later works, is set in a small 19th century village, secluded by a dark forest which are forbidden to them, due to some strange beast rumored to live there. If there is one thing I'd blame for the downfall of THE VILLAGE is the advertising. Advertising it as a horror movie rather than what it really is is a shallow cway to put it. Sure, the twist ending is the kind that will divide the audience into two; not everyone's gonna march with Shymalan's parade. Well not everyone is going to like THE VILLAGE, yet but that only proves he's one of the more misunderstood film minds in Hollywood today. Shymalan may have gotten some bad feedback after this, but I'm here to defend him on his behalf.The film may not be that scary, but M. Night Shyamalan manages to make the human characters interesting and the film atmospheric. It may not be his best film, but perhaps, it's his most intriguing and often profound. It's either you love it, or just leave it alone. Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",The Village

120,gregsrants,"An unfortunate mis-step, but I hope its part of the directors DVD collection in about 15 years",5,1 August 2004,"Expectation: ex.pec.ta.tion. noun: the act of anticipation. , a looking forward with hope or pleasure , a reasonable chance. (Source: New Concise Dictionary)Expectations, when it comes to a Hollywood production, rarely result in matching the height of its publicity. I think back to Godzilla, The Matrix Sequels and Planet of the Apes as just a few films in recent recollection that burst onto the scene amongst a glut of television promotions, newsstand headlines and fast food tie-ins. Their mass marketing teams were good enough to grant each of these films good opening week-ends and each may even have made money for their studio bosses, but average Joe Public was duped and word soon got around about the disappointment of the venture. So when M. Night Shyamalan's new film The Village started to hit theaters with teasers and trailers throughout the spring months I was immediately hit with an expectation based on the directors track record alone. The Sixth Sense, Signs and Unbreakable were all exceptional films, two of which have their standing in the top grossing films of all time. M. Night has become the Alfred Hitchcock of our day in his manipulation of an audience and his revelations in the final chapter. The particular allure of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable was brought by the final pages of the secretive script and people in mass began talking to friends, family and co-workers about the 'I didn't see it coming' endings. The trailers for The Village looked as promising as any other summer scare. Lacking the big names of Willis or Gibson, M. Night instead went with a familiar if not paparazzi hunted group of talented actors. Joaquin Pheonix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are ordinary villagers in Covington Pennsylvania who live their lives in a Little House on the Prairie environment. They eat dinners at long tables, bake their own bread and eat their own livestock. It is a peaceful place, a tranquil settling. Or is it?At the village border is a forest marked with yellow flags, burning torches and lookout towers. Teachers impart the history of the village, frightening the youth with stories of creatures that embark upon the woods.'We have always had since the day we settled here a gentle understanding with a the creatures who live beyond our borders. We do now sway into their woods, they do not come into our village. It is a truce.'Also forbidden is the color red (for reasons not particularly clear, but a between the lines explanation can be found) and the rules of the village are upheld no matter the cost. When a young villager dies, Lucius (Pheonix) offers to leave the town in search of the next village where he can find medicine for those that are ill. But the elders are not willing to risk the life of someone traveling into the land of the creatures and they hold back young Lucius from attempting his journey.However, an accident of jealousy leaves a villager in desperate need of medical attention and this time, a young blind woman named Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard in an exceptional performance) petitions an elder to go into the woods and trek to the nearest doctor. Her wish it granted and the movie runs from a state of paranoia to a M. Night does Blair Witch Project. Writing a review for a M. Night film is like reading a who-dunnit book and stopping before the last chapter. We have to pull ourselves from revealing anything that the audience might not foresee to give them the same sense of revelation as we felt days earlier. Major plot points are kept from the writing as to not sway you into finding out the films secrets and we dance around the issue with anything but grace or agility. I can say that The Village does have two twists, both of which you could probably figure out since you know to look for them as soon as the drapes reveal the theatre screen. I actually found it a distraction trying to connect the dots one step in front of the director's imagery instead of enjoying the film as a whole. That said, I was not overly impressed with this production and maybe I can go as far as to say that I was disappointed on how it resolved. The premise and the director gave hope that this might be one of the scariest movies to hit the screen since The Exorcist, but instead, I felt teased like someone was tickling my foot with a feather  enjoyable but ultimately annoying.In this crazy world of special editions and director box sets, I think it might take about 15 years and 9 or so more films before this one is accepted for anything more than a good attempt that failed to win over a mass audience. When M. Night is given the royal treatment of a directors set much like Stanley Kubrick, I like most will hope that The Village is part of the collection. For like Kubrick's The Shining, this film was not one of the best, but it wouldn't seem like a complete set without it.In the meanwhile, my disappointment will have to stew and hopefully, M. Night can follow the great Hitchcock model and quickly erase our memories with a better effort.",The Village
121,Rogue-32,let's twist again!,9,3 August 2004,"You know you're well on your way to becoming a filmmaker of serious note when your films start to become either passionately loved or hideously reviled. Judging from what I've been reading of late, M. Night Shyamalan has definitely gotten into that league with his new film The Village.This is a brilliant film that works as both an allegory and as an actual story, with characters you care about. It's brilliant because Night manages to take a really tricky plot and execute it with dazzling clarity of vision. The thing I liked most about it was how I was expecting it to be a different kind of movie - this is what Night wanted us to expect, so we'd be caught off guard by what the film actually is about. A lot of people (including some very vocal ones at the Arclight in Hollywood, where I saw the film last Saturday) were bent out of shape by this, whining that Shyamalan 'misled and tricked' them. To these people, I offer three words: GRIP. GET ONE. If the film had been what they had been set up to expect, these same people would have been carping that it was predictable. What I recommend: don't read reviews (you can stop right here with this one, if you want). Don't listen to people who've seen it. Just go check it out for yourself. If you're looking for an original, thought-provoking movie that will leave you with goosebumps (but not for any of the reasons you might expect), you can't go wrong with The Village.",The Village
122,rainking_es,Shyamalan blooms again,8,19 March 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan is one of those privileged minds, like Alejandro Amenábar, which have learned their lesson about how to tell stories, how to thrill, how to frighten us, how to attract people to the cinemas. Maybe they're not renovating the Seventh Art, but they sure can defend that sentence that says ""the movies are meant to entertain and make fun"". They're the first ones in the class when is time to tell disturbing plots, those who will keep your attention till the very end, and then will knock you out with a final twist. That's just and old trick with a big disadvantage: the second time you watch ""The 6th Sense"" or ""The Others"" you will feel a 99% less of excitement but I think that's a risk that is worth taking.After the delusion of ""Signs"", Shyamalan reborns with ""The Village"", a precious moral fable about a group of villagers that are besieged by some creatures who live in the adjacent woods. Shyamalan demonstrates that he knows how to go beyond that spectacular-final-twist-of-the-story from ""6th Sense"" or ""Unbreakable"", that he can move us with innocence, and tenderness, even with a nice love story. He shows us only the things we need to see, he guides us, he handles us and his camera as he pleases, and he's good! His actors direction is just splendid, because it's not enough to have a bunch of great actors (Weaver, Hurt, Gleeson, Brody) no, you have to lead them with wisdom and talent, and M. Night never neglect his actors.""The Village"" is just like a fairy tale, one of those that our grandfathers used to tell us, one of those we listened with our ears wide open one of those you wouldn't want to end.Yeah, we need Greg Aronofsky, Michael Haneke, or Takeshi Kitano; but we also need directors like M. Night Shyamalan, we need some escape, some fantasy, we need mystery. And he is quite capable of giving that to us every 2 or 3 years.PD: Pay attention to Bryce Dallas Howard. Pay attention to that red hair, those blue eyes, and that enigmatic beauty, 'cause she's gonna set tongues wagging.

This is definitely not one of Shyamalan's best and it mostly has to do with the fact that the script was very predictable and though it's as slow as his previous films, because the script suffers, so does the pacing. The only real plus to this average thriller is newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of actor turned director Ron Howard) whose superior acting as blind Ivy Walker shows that M. Night Shyamalan still has what it takes when it comes to directing actors. I look forward to his next film, Lady in the Water. However, this time, only a 6 out of 10.",The Village
124,swilliky,Beginning of Shyamalan's decline,3,22 January 2017,"M. Night Shyamalan returned with a period piece about a village in the late 19th Century plagued by strange creatures in the woods and isolated from other towns. Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) desires to venture into the town for new cures though the elders forbid it. The community thrives on their innocents and simple nature of living, though every few nights, the creatures arrive to threaten their existence and keep them happy to be safe within their walls. The Village elders consist of Edward Walker (William Hurt) the leader, Lucius's mother Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver), a mourning widower August Nicholson (Brendan Gleeson). The issue of not having proper medicine affects all the members of the community and is a major argument for sending someone to the towns for assistance.

125,FilmOtaku,"Beautifully filmed, with an interesting story",7,1 August 2004,"I sometimes wonder if M. Night Shymalan has directed himself into a corner after a strong start.  Since `The Sixth Sense', audiences have been expecting his films to all be of the same genre, and while his succeeding films have had an underlying theme of the supernatural, he seems to have lost the confidence of the general movie-going public.  I think that this is in part due to this nagging feeling I get that he has a lot of self-satisfaction with his work, essentially saying `Look how clever I can be see it? See it?'  But even more so, I firmly believe, with all due respect to said general movie-going public, that not every film of his is going to have a huge `twist' in the end, or `Boo!' moments that are going to scare us into nervous laughter  and most importantly, he doesn't purport to do this with all of his films; it is simply the vast chasm between audience expectation and director's intent.`The Village', Shymalan's latest offering, is the tale of a small 19th century village whose residents live with the daily threat of the unknown creatures which dwell in the woods that border it.  There is a `truce' between the residents of these two areas; as long as the villagers don't breach their border, the creatures will leave them alone.  One day, however, after the death of a young boy, a young man from the village, Lucius Hunt, (Joaquin Phoenix) after many pleas to the village elders to go through the woods to one of the surrounding towns in order to get medicine to prevent future loss of life.  The next day, red marks appear on the door, and the village's animals turn up dead and shorn; presumably, the creatures in the woods are not happy and are declaring `war' on the village. 
Shymalan favors a sullen, emotionally pained and quiet protagonist, and `The Village' follows this trend.  Phoenix is all large eyes, slightly stooped and silent, while maintaining a large amount of strength and character.  His love interest, Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the unofficial mayor of the village, (Bryce Dallas Howard) is probably the most heroic figure of the film, however, and is definitely the most compelling character.  Much has been said of Howard's performance, and the accolades are most definitely warranted.  Adrien Brody has a small but important role as Noah, basically the village idiot, and while he speaks very little, Brody's acting is once again unreal.  I have admired him since seeing `Summer of Sam' years ago, and he his talent has only strengthened.  I didn't even hate William Hurt, which I fully expected to do, just because I find him to be so unbelievably bland.  The films he appears in are generally good, but his lack of any kind of dynamic is disappointing.  As Edward Walker in `The Village', however, he is not horrid.    The production values and cinematography in `The Village' really are quite good  Roger Deakins, who I have greatly admired since his first collaboration with the Coen brothers on Barton Fink, really is a master in his field.  His lighting and photography are fantastic in this film, and, as a friend said to me on the drive home from the theater, `the film was really beautiful.'I went into this film having seen some really bad reviews, but the ones that gave me pause were positive reviews by other critics that I highly respect. I noticed that several of the negative reviews disdainfully compared `The Village' to Shymalan's earlier film, `Unbreakable.'  I'm sure it was not the reviewers' intent, but this actually made me want to see this film more, because I think that `Unbreakable' was a fantastic film, but that it was a box office disappointment because it was not a clone of `The Sixth Sense'. Mainstream audiences were expecting another scare-fest, and they got Bruce Willis again, but this time as a sad, beaten-down superhero of some sorts. I found `Unbreakable' to be a very personal and endearing film, and I attribute a lesser degree of those adjectives to `The Village'.  It was not a phenomenal film, but it was certainly not a disappointment.  The story was solid and kind of left me with the `Hmmminteresting' sentiment that I take away from good episodes of `The Outer Limits' or `Twilight Zone'.  The now-expected `twist' was visible by about 2/3 into the film, but who cares? It was still a good story, and the film, while more of a drama than a thriller/horror offering is a solid movie that I feel deserves a lot more credit than it has been given.  I'm glad that I didn't let some bad reviews mar my viewing experience because I went into the film with an open mind and came out generally satisfied.--Shelly",The Village

The villagers aren't allowed to walk into the forest because ""those who we don't speak of"" live there. Some mysterious and aggressive creatures that's made a peace deal with the village people... but as soon as the rebellious and seeking Lucius Hunt breaks the deal, with entering the woods... the whole thing is suddenly turned upside down.THE VILLAGE is beautiful, dramatic, fascinating and exciting. With very well working concept, romance, dialog and acting the movie works completely on most levels, although it misses sadly enough on probably it's biggest target; the horror. The movie isn't very much of a fright actually, it's entertaining and fascinating, not scary. And this may be a big let-down for people who expect being scared out of the chair, cause in my position I really never got to that point. But; it's exciting at times and the movie never looses focus and you always have to have your eyes on the screen.

128,Superunknovvn,Less than average movie,4,16 February 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan is for movies what The Strokes are for music. He's made a critically acclaimed and commercially successful debut and now it's going steadily downhill for him. ""The Sixth Sense"" was highly original and very successful and bought him some time in Hollywood. ""The Village"" indicates that this time is almost over. Shyamalan movies have never been famous for fast pacing. They take some time to get started, but about halfway through you should be well into the story and starting to get all thrilled by the events. The problem with ""The Village"" is, it never gets started. It goes quiet scene after quiet scene with LOTS of whispered dialog. With so much dialog you'd think you get some character development. Wrong! The characters remain shallow and uninteresting and the whole movie is just an incredible bore. The direction is absolutely horrible, too. Why would Shyamalan always shoot people's backs? Seriously, sometimes it seems as if the director just put the camera anywhere and went to have a cup of coffee while the actors were performing. Maybe, the idea was to show how everybody in the village is keeping a secret by shooting people's backs all the time. Even if this was the intention behind it, it was still executed badly and seemed very unprofessional. From the last three movies Shyamalan has made, we know that he always tries to come up with a surprise ending. Problem is, the twist is too easy to figure out this time. Although the idea itself isn't half bad, it could have used some more (or better) story lines around. As it is, ""The Village"" merely would qualify as an episode of Twilight Zone. If Shyamalan doesn't come up with something really great next time the audience is going to lose interest. It's sad because he has shown in the past that he is capable of delivering intriguing and original work in his best moments. ""The Village"" definitely doesn't fall into this category, though.",The Village
129,Hayden-86055,One of the weirdest and most misunderstood films ever created,10,14 June 2020,"MAJOR SPOILERS AHEADThere's been a lot of divided opinion on this film, and I do actually understand why someone may not like it, it's not a horror film so don't go in expecting jumps at every corner and bucket falls of gore, nor is it a stereotypical 19th century thriller, the dialogue is all mixed up with modern-day English and 19th century dialect, but that's because the town is created in the idealistic image of the original designers and people who thought up the idea.Like Shutter Island I would argue that this is infinitely better on a second viewing when you see all the subtle hints that all is not conforming to the usual Victorian rural village life. On my first viewing I would only have given this a 6 or 7/10.The acting is beautiful and the three main characters played by Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix and Adrian Brody is quite frankly Oscar worthy. Every shot is very subversive and surprisingly hands play a huge and abnormal part in this, in the forest each branch is snagging forward creakily as if it's a hand and in the scene where Joaquin's character is stabbed the angle the knife goes in and all four of their hands being in shot is unreal and tense. Also, the music by James Newton Howard is actually fantastic and one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard!Not all critics and people will love this film, and that's fine as everyone has a different view and I understand why this film may not be liked, read Roger Ebert's scathing review of it for example, and he's certainly no fool.10/10: Brilliant, unique and worth two viewings if you've only seen it once",The Village
130,TheOtherFool,Top notch acting and a haunting story... but a disappointing ending,7,17 January 2005,"Of Shyamalans previous movies I only liked 'Signs', so I'm hardly a fan of him. Still, there was some anticipation surrounding this movie, with it's superb cast and an interesting plot.It involves a small town hidden in the woods, where the people have some sort of truce with the creatures from those woods: they won't come in the village if the people don't go into their territory. This way, the small village has no bonds with the outside world.Problems arise when a young man called Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) is stabbed and desperately needs medication from the outside world. His blind girlfriend Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) sets out to seek help, through the woods, into the wide world.In the first hour of the film, it's perfectly balanced between the scares of the creatures and the relationships unfolded, but once Ivy sets out into the woods the movie loses it's momentum. Although I filled the box 'spoilers included' I won't go too far with that: an observant viewer might know enough by remembering who the director of this movie is...As said, the ending is rather disappointing. It feels strange to see 'the real world' as we know it. There's a rather useless scene with a patrolman stealing some medication for Ivy... it just didn't really fit in to the movie.What still stands though are the excellent performances by the whole of the cast, with some exceptional acting in particular by the relatively unknown Bryce Dallas Howard and William Hurt as her father.On the whole one would perhaps expect more after it's first hour, but 'The Village' still is a movie to watch, as it's truly scary at times and has some of the best performances of the year.Edit: after watching the movie for the second time I feel I have to upgrade it to a 7/10.

How many slow tracking shots of people doing mundane things are there in 'The Village'? Because if you are forced to sit through it because, say, your fiancée loves it, or you are trapped in M. Night Shyamalan's house, it might help you through this turgid melodrama to try counting. That's the worst problem. The second problem is that Bryce Howard can't act. Well, she can act, but only at the same level - no light or shade. You never believe she is blind for a minute, only that she's stepped out of an amateur production of 'Hamlet' by mistake. The third problem is that there's not enough story. That's why after fifteen minutes you start to get restless and pick holes in the thing. Guessing the twist? It's not hard to guess WHAT it is, only the 'why' is different. The fact that ********SPOILER************ the village is a wildlife (p)reserve for the wealthy families of the victims of urban crime is all the story there is. In the longeurs at the beginning, you start to wonder how they live, where all the oil comes from and why the 'elders' of the village are all under fifty. Shyamalan is too busy trying to create atmosphere to bother creating authenticity, which The Village completely lacks. In Witness they took the trouble to explain the commercial life of the Amish, for example, and that gave it a reality within the movie. This community never gets remotely believable. If The Village had been an episode of 'The Outer Limits' or 'X-Files' even, it would probably have been a classic. But it's ninety minutes too long. Oh, and I thought Lucius's colour must have been red. Blood, you see. The fact that they left his fate open is an acknowledgment that the twist isn't strong enough to close the story.",The Village
133,movieguy1021,The Village: 6/10,6,9 August 2004,"The most effective way to get a demographic to a movie where they wouldn't normally go is by misleading trailers. If the trailers for The Hulk depicted it to be an outstanding drama, like it was, I would doubt it would get its money back. The same goes for The Village. M. Night Shyamalan, known for his what-you-don't-see-scares-you type of movies (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs), now has done The Village, which, according to the ads, is a scare-fest around 1900. In reality, it's a period piece about some haunted woods. The movie chronicles their interactions with each other, for the most part.In a small village surrounded by woods, the people of Covington live in constant fear of the creatures that live in the woods around. They have struck up a shaky deal with them-neither of them enter the other's territory. Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) is blind and is in mutual love with taciturn Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix). Since it seems that simple-minded Noah (Adrien Brody) can enter the woods without being harmed, Lucius tries it and ends up disturbing the balance between the two life forms. Soon Lucius is put out of commission and Ivy has to walk through the woods to get medicine. You know, even though it's 1900, I would think that people would have more sense than to have a blind person go through haunted woods by themselves.Shyamalan knows how to create fear, and for a few fleeting seconds, he does in The Village. The failing point is that there's barely any moments in which that could happen. Most of the movie is spent on the characters and unnecessary subplots that have no purpose. Shyamalan knows the what-you-don't-see-scares-you way of going about it, but with another overbearing score, James Newton Howard takes the what-you-hear-scares-you way of going about it, and winds up being almost farcical, which is what the movie becomes at times. Seeing the creatures is one of the funniest moments in a movie this year. I mean...come on! Still, when it is scary, it's pretty damn intense. But for one minute out of a 108 minute movie, it's not a good ratio.Shyamalan is known for his twists at the end of movies. The Sixth Sense had one that was truly shocking; Unbreakable's was also mind-blowing but one I'd need to see again, but Signs' was just plain silly. Many people feel that in both Signs and The Village he's writing a script so he can have a twist at the end. The twist is what basically saved this movie. It's a shocking twist, one that I didn't get, and most people didn't, also, even though they say they did. It's much better than the stupidity of Signs' ending. That's where the first hour and a half comes in. It's basically fluff, with unnecessary subplots thrown in (including the love twist with Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt) and a bunch of random characters. Also, with the slow build-up of the creatures, instead of a slow pay-off of slowly revealing the monsters, they come out all at once. And as I said before, I cracked up when I saw them.The acting here isn't as good as Shyamalan's others. Phoenix (who seems to have taken over the wheel from Bruce Willis) isn't as good as he was in Signs, surprisingly. Howard isn't worthy of all of this praise, but she was still good. Weaver doesn't have much to do, but Hurt totally owns the screen whenever he's on. If you're looking for a reason to see this movie, see it for William Hurt. I'll probably be killed for this, but I think Brody was better here than in The Pianist. He seems to be having fun here. If you go into The Village looking for a fun time, you probably won't find it. You may come out of it with more than I did, but it has its moments, especially at the end.My rating: 6/10Rated PG-13 for a scene of violence and frightening situations.",The Village
134,Andres-Camara,Still engaged in the same genre,2,6 December 2016,"I return to see a M. Night Shyamalan movie, I hope this time, I will find the director of The Sixth Sense again. But to my disappointment, again, I do not find the same director. He knew the culmination of his career and since then, everything is downhill and deeper and deeper.Spoiler:You can not get my attention at any time. It does not achieve a bit of intrigue. From the beginning you smell the final result. He never made some nice shots, but if something had Shyamalan is that he knew how to maintain the tension, what's more, seeing what was coming, without hiding it, the adrenaline rose. I imagine Haley Joel Osment had too much to do with it. But now is not the boy before. And that shows. It has a nice photograph as well as makeup and hairdresser. For many people the romantic moment of holding hands is something very beautiful. The problem is that we do not make a movie. The actors do not tell me anything, none, I see them empty and the worst, do not give me any feeling or feeling. Every time you shoot a movie, it's worse than the last one. I do not know how deep it was, but I do not know, how long people will last watching their movies in theaters. I'm starting to get tired.",The Village

Until (now) I saw it for myself it wasn't that bad at all. It was quite interesting. At least better than The Signs.Yes, the beginning of the movie actually not that interesting and could be quite boring. But this is M. Night Shyamalan movie, he only concentrate on twisted ending (is that the good thing  I don't think so). What make this movie better than I thought was - there is more than one twist, that what make it interesting.The casting is surprising good, somewhat better than the movie. I say Bryce Dallas Howard have done a brilliant job of all.

136,OriginalMovieBuff21,Comepletely disappointed and ashamed of M. Night Shyalaman,6,13 September 2004,"The Village was a complete disappointment. All through this film I wanted to have a jump and goosebumps down my arms and legs, but it never happened except one little scene. It was just a disappointment. I loved the first half of the movie until I realized what was going on during the movie and I just layed my head in my hands and shook my head and said, ""Why."" M. Night Shyamalan was trying to make a great twisting movie but it failed. Sorry. I'm actually a big fan of his, movies like, The Sixth Sense and Signs were amazing movies, especially Signs, being one of my favorite movies. The story went out good and the music was great I have to say. Also the acting was good, no corny remarks or anything which I liked, but still it was kind of a disappointment.5.5/10",The Village
137,Antagonisten,Hugely disappointing,3,10 January 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan has to be one of the most over-rated directors in Hollywood right now. Not only is he getting paid very good money to make his movies, he more or less makes the same movie again and again. And I for one am getting tired of it.The Village centers around a lonely little Village in the middle of a forest. Around their village they have a fence that marks the border that no one may pass. There are beings in the woods that will take anyone that crosses the border and exact vengeance on the village for the trespassing. But when something horrible happens, what will they do? Will they dare venture for help? As most of Shyamalans films ""The Village"" starts out fine. He is adept at creating a mysterious and haunting mood and it works here. For a while at least. Because soon the constant speaking in riddles and constant mentioning of ""those we do not speak of"" becomes annoying. Also the pace is terrible. The movie moves onward at a slow crawl and never really picks up pace before the end. Acting is mostly decent but no character really stands out as very interesting.But ultimately where this movie fails is the script-writing. I think it's time for Shyamalan to stay away from writing for a while, to get some new ideas. Because the formula of ""Movie that drags on forever with a twist in the end"" is becoming more and more dated. And even more trouble when i could see the plot-twist coming a mile away. ""The Sixth Sense"" was a decent thriller, ""Unbreakable"" was excellent. But since then Shyamalan has been going downhill. Which unfortunately makes this a waste of talent and money as well as my time.I rate it 3/10.",The Village
138,EmperorNortonII,More Than a Horror Story,8,28 May 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan offers another thriller fraught with twists in ""The Village."" The story sees the residents of a little isolated village who fear a horde of monsters in the surrounding woods. At least, that's the way things seem on the surface. As the story unwinds, so many secrets are revealed. What are the creatures in the woods? Why exactly did the people leave ""the towns""? What are the village elders hiding? Shyamalan lets us know that things are not quite what they seem. The thriller is filled with an all-star cast, including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody, Joaquin Phoenix, and the breakout star, Bryce Dallas Howard as brave blind girl Ivy Walker. Watch ""The Village"" with an open mind. It might surprise you!",The Village

140,statuskuo,Amazon Prime Revisits,5,17 October 2020,"It was 16 years ago when I worked on the DVD release of this movie. By ""work"" I mean having to watch it a hundred times to make sure there were no issues with it. So I studied pretty much every frame of this film. Talk about torture.
Now that I am older and watching it with some distance, I understand the intention of the film but the core story is flawed. Without giving too much away, it is about a small village that is haunted by a creature to which they refer to as ""the ones we don't speak about"" as if the name itself would conjure them to their borders. Somehow they've convinced the villagers that they have made a truce and if they don't go past their borders, the creatures won't impose themselves on them.Yep.And the rest, is just really great stars in what appears to be Amish Playhouse In The Park. I mean, I'm not sure what they were watching to mimic it, but it is corny on a level that, I guarantee you, the actors looking back most likely were embarrassed by it. Not that they should. They did the best with the material. The heaviest lifting being of William Hurt. Even he couldn't make some of the lines work especially when you discover where it all comes from.
Anyway, there are so many questions once you are done watching the film. Silliness, logic flaws, poor decision making, like sending a blind girl through the woods to go get medicine to help an injured villager? Come on. Even in its most bizarre that doesn't fly.I feel like director, writer, producer (man, he was proud of this). M. Night Shamaylan had this really great idea but once he got developing it, he was too stubborn to let some of the details go. It isn't a BAD movie, since I really appreciate it for it's dreary atmosphere (village actually feels cozy) but it leaves you with an emptiness that makes you wonder how this village could endure the next tragedy.
Hard to say.",The Village
141,Rickting,A load of preposterous nonsense,4,20 December 2014,"The Village is where it all started to go downhill from M Night Shyamalan. OK, so it was perhaps mismarkted as a flat out horror movie and it's not as bad as The Happening or The Last Airbender, but it's certainly not a good movie. An isolated 19th century village is being disturbed by the creatures in the surrounding forest. Part horror film, part love story, this is, in a nutshell, the Sunshine of horror films. Sunshine had a good first two thirds, before a misjudged twist sent it down the toilet. The difference here is that before the twist, the film wasn't good. Actors doing their best stoner impressions and speaking awkwardly bad dialogue isn't my definition of good. The story is sort of interesting, but it's too slow and creaks along at an overly leisurely pace. 2 dumb twists bombard audiences and undo what little tension there was before hand. This film suffered from misleading marketing, but it's Shyamalan's fault at well. He can do so much better than that lame script! People forget that none of Shyamalan's twists make sense. Bruce Willis would have realized something was up since no-one ever spoke to him, the way Samuel L Jackson found Bruce Willis didn't make any sense, and why would intelligent aliens who are susceptible to water go to a planet which is 75% water? However, the twist that the village is set in the present day is just ridiculous. How has no-one found the village? Surely a plane will have passed over at some point? The plot in general is nonsensical. I knew the twist already, but it was still a jarring tonal shift. The Village benefits from some interesting social commentary and Roger Deakins' beautiful cinematography, as well as a couple of the subtle, clever thrills which are the reason I like Shyamalan's earlier films. Still, TV never takes off, and from its opening it's just annoying and poorly written. This one is just silly, and in terms of logic there's no saving it.4/10",The Village
142,Nightman85,Apparently the critics can't stand a plot twist.,10,2 January 2006,"Highly underrated thriller is one of M. Night Shyamalan's greatest films yet, and certainly doesn't disappoint his fans!Pennsylvania village is held in isolation by it's surrounding woods that harbor mythical monsters! Beautifully directed, greatly acted, and has a story full of mystery, suspense, and mind-blowing twists. M. Night Shyamalan is a master at using an audience's expectations to create original and surprising thrillers and The Village is perhaps his most clever turn as a writer. His direction is great as always, capturing some gorgeous imagery in the old-settlers village and in the wooded wilderness. He also creates a terrific atmosphere of wonder and some tight suspense scenes. James Newton Howard returns to score this picture, he previously worked on Shyamalan's Signs (2002), and delivers another elegant piece here.The cast is top-notch. Rising star Bryce Dallas Howard proves not only to be a lovely girl but a captivating actress as well. Joaquin Phoenix does a strong performance with his silent character. Adrian Brody does well as the village idiot. Veteran actors William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver turn in good performances as always.Don't listen to the critics on this film, The Village is one of the most surprising thrillers ever! *** 1/2 out of ****",The Village
143,MichaelMargetis,Shyamalan's Fourth Installment of Terror!,8,2 April 2005,"Review (if you haven't seen the film): All I can tell you about M. Night Shamalyadingdong's (I mean Shyamalan's) new film The Village, is it's better than The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but not quite as genius as his last movie Signs. In closing this short review all I could tell you is the film (along with Manchurian Candidate) deserved somewhere between 4 and 4 ½ stars, but I gave it the lower number instead because their is always room for improvement. And that's about all I'm going to tell you. Honestly if I reveal anymore it will ruin the tremendous experience for you. You should go into it knowing nothing, I did.IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT DON'T READ ANY FURTHERI found The Village to be the most unexpected thing you'd find of the master of terror M. Night Shyamalan. Although it doesn't attract it's viewers with spine-tingling thrills like M. Night's last installment of fright ""Signs"", it attracts viewers because the character development and emotions are just so dang interesting. Also what reels viewers in is the mystery of it all. Why were these settlers here? Who were this pig-like monkey men in the woods? And why the hell didn't they try to hunt them. All this keeps the audience glued to the screen as long as the film in the projection booth is running.THE SET-UPI found the set-up of the settlers in the woods quite interesting. I felt the whole idea about the first settlers their being known as ""elders"" who make all the decisions about the colony's future, kind of borrowed a little bit from other things, but it was still pretty intriguing to watch. I liked most of the characters, especially Joaquin Phoenix's character Lucius. Lucius is kind of like the opposite of the character Phoenix played in Signs, Merril Hess. Lucius is the Arnold Schwarzwenegger of the film, you know the fearless hero, well until he gets stabbed. I loved newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard's character, although she was blind she was still the toughest female in the Village, and in a way she was the hero of the films. Adrien Brody's character Noah Percy, was extremely creepy, while William Hurt's character wasn't very creepy but very god-like (in a way in which he called the shots). Sigourney Weaver's character was very short-lived and simple, she was a lonely single parent desperate for security which only could be provided by a man.THE CHILLSI didn't find that the film scared me at all. It only creeped me out once. The part where they first show the ""creature"" up close and personal. That would make for one hell of a Halloween costume.THE WAY IT WAS SHOTI loved the camera work in this. LOVED IT. Nice camera tricks, gave a lot of depth to the film (although it really didn't need it, it was a very nice add-on). M. Night Shyamalan showcases his numerous talents once again in this film.THE ACTINGI thought The Village contained many great performances in it. Joaquin Phoenix was great as always, and Sigourney Weaver did a fine job (as usual). William Hurt gave an undeniably great performance, and I was quite impressed with newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter). However, the real stand-out of the movie was Academy Award Winning Adrien Brody as Noah Percy. He plays his character with such passion and depth it's hard to resist the notion of him getting another Oscar nomination this year. I've seen many people play mentally handicapped individuals (some good, some bad, some great, some horrible), and Adrien Brody's one is up their with Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man and Sean Penn in I Am Sam. He also adds a creepy and violently disturbed dimension to his characters that terrified me while viewing, yet attracted me to know much more about his character.THE WAY IT ENDEDI thought the ending was the most clever part of the movie. To end it with the monsters really being real, would have been lazy, and common. But how they had it just being a hoax so that William Hurt could have everyone afraid to leave out into the real modern world (because he was a part of a support group) was BRILLIANT! How he paid for planes not to fly over the area was just ingenious. The best part was when Bryce Dallas Howard's character gets to the outside world, and it's modern day! How great is that! It felt like the ending of a great Twilight Zone episode. A two hour Twilight Zone episode. In closing to the review, I thought the ending showed that M. Night Shyamalan could make great suspense stories, even if it wasn't supernatural. He showed a whole new side of his work in this, and showed he could be versatile. The critics slammed it because whenever we go into a film by M. Night Shyamalan we expect supernatural stuff to take place. Well, from now on, don't. So before I leave you, I'd like to say  it's way more easy to make a film about monsters, then it is to make a film about people posing to be monsters to keep people restrained from the real world. M. Night caught us off guard in this flick, and I liked that.

For some reason it reminded me of Tim Burtons ""Big Fish"", had this fairy-tale-ish quality that's very rare among Hollywood movies; I thought that Adrien Brody did a good job.I have to admit, the first time I watched ""The Village"" I had a little too much wine that evening.Then I watched it a second time – sober – thinking to myself, ""What the hell am I watching here? And why am I watching this?"" A storyline that is so hackneyed, you might suspect that it has been written by a 3rd grader and a finishing twist that seems to have been pulled out of an orifice that IMDb won't allow me to name here. No, I'm not going to count up the plot-holes – look, there's already more than 1,000 reviews on this page, most of them talking about the plot-holes and inconsistencies (the handful of positive reviews are probably written by Manoj Nelliyattu himself or people suffering from delusions).Generally we have a cast of able actors but, as is the case in almost all film productions, the director is the boss and if the director tells the actor, ""act weird"" or ""recite these lines, whether they make sense or not"", well, the actor hasn't got much of a choice. So don't blame those poor sods; the blatant nonsense you'll be watching has grown on the manure pile of director Shyamalan.See, Shyamalan used to be an able director – not brilliant but good, who knew how to make an average-to-good film. Unfortunately, at one point in time the young director begun to believe in his own hype and began directing film despite better knowledge and common sense. Megalomania is actually a real psychological disorder that's clinically treatable – but throwing a million dollar budget at somebody afflicted and confirming his mania, that's called enabling, and that is what Hollywood's soulless executives are essentially guilty of. ""The Village"" was just the beginning and the final result (until this point in time) can be seen in ""The Last Airbender"".You, dear reader, may have come under the impression that I harbor a certain animosity toward the director. I assure you, that is not the case. I wish M. Night Shyamala nothing but the best, that he may one day recover and find his spot in the industry where he belongs and where his work will be appreciated – in Bollywood cinema.Years later I would watch a spoof-scene in one of the ""Scary Movies"" films – pretty much summons up that train-wreck of a movie that is ""The Village"".I have to give a mandatory one point, so I try to console myself by saying that I give it to Brody, who has to play ""The Village"" idiot – out of pity.",The Village

'The Village' is another one of his films which will not be for everyone. You really have to concentrate on this film, but only so you can understand what is happening. Thanks to the marketing, you enter this film, believing it will be a horror only to find out it's a romantic drama. It's a bizarre film which is even harder to explain or to review. There are some highlights about the film though, with some great score and some good acting. It's not the worst film, but it is defiantly not the best film.

148,bsinc,James Newton Howard saves the day,7,18 December 2005,"I am kind of baffled by this movie  I have problems describing it!""Unbelievable lack of advertising strategy"" would be my first observation. M. Night Shyamalan has made his career with suspenseful thrillers with plot twists at the very end, but ""The Village"" takes a somewhat different step, perhaps unnoticed to the untrained eye. The entire movie still looks and feels exactly the same as the rest of M.'s previous movies, which, in this case is more of a negative than a positive thing, yet at the same time it's exactly this rich quality of production that gives it the strongest assets. Let's face it, ""The Village"" is yet another one of M.'s misunderstood movies due to ""poorly educated"" viewers. I'm talking about the type that doesn't get the blatantly obvious or the blatantly irrelevant and writes posts like ""what color does Ivy see in Luscious and her father"". A Non-important, Irrellevant one, btw!. The exquisite ensemble of actors and actresses (special kudos to the sexy redhead Bryce Dallas Howard) made the script breathe and gave sense to M's story. But what saved the whole movie was the musical score. James Newton Howard singlehandedly brought life to ""The Village"". What this man does is beyond me, I can describe it only as perfection. Every score he has so far composed for M felt like the movie was made after the score so it could blend in just the right way. The music editing deserves a ton of recognition and praise as well because it gave the movie just the right tone and atmosphere. M's movies have always demanded the viewers utmost attention, and so far this has always been rewarded many times over. ""The Village"" will probably be remembered as one of his weakest and least liked movies, and I have to understand why. He has been using the same style of story-telling since 1999 and this movie should have been an exception because it stands out. The story is minimalistic (as are the ""twists"" towards the end) and if one doesn't pay enough attention the main theme of the movie gets easily lost. It's love! I think. The plot, the motives, even the explanations are pretty shaky but this movie delivers numerous amazing moments that I know I'll just want to see over and over again. M is THE MASTER of subtlety and if you won't see it in ""The Village"" you won't see it anywhere else! And it's exactly these incredibly subtle, thought-out scenes that have immense power and are the best parts (literally) of the movie. It's because of them that I enjoyed ""The Village"" as much as I did and looked past the simple story that never even intended to be the key thing here (it's even revealed before the end). It's unnoticed things like cinematography that treats the character of Ivy differently that any other character because she can't see, it's the barely noticed tear on her left cheek that falls down her face when Luscious declares his love to her, it's the expression that he makes when he gets stabbed, it's the breath-takingly perfect last 5 seconds of the movie, then the score with instant fade to blackpriceless! I sincerely have to admit I have no idea what happened to the 60 million dollar budget and where it went to, but ""The Village"" does feel rich (despite mostly being in a very minimalistic location), full of details, and manages to provide the absolute best of sound, style, cinematography, acting and music making it an absolute treat for the senses. And I actually like the fact that this movie is generally hated, it makes it more mine on some personal level. 7/10Recommendations: any avid fans of M, you are the ones that will appreciate this movie, anyone into great sound and music editing, cinematography, outstanding acting performancesthe works. BUT A WORD OF CAUTION-don't expect much from the story, this time the movie relies completely on the actors and the solid production.",The Village
149,MovieCriticOnline,Bryce Dallas Howard has to be one of the worst actors,3,5 May 2021,"Bryce Dallas Howard has to be one of the worst actors ever. She plays a blind person with zero sign of afflicted eyes. And the way she delivered dialogue was like hearing someone read off the page on stage in a bad school play. They pretty much all played it like a bad school play. Hurt was best and Bryce was the worst. Bryce didn't even bother to try to convince us she is actually blind.Bad acting always affects my view of a movie. The premise was interesting, but not sure it was enough to rewatch. I like the idea of how easy it is to keep a large group of people obedient based on a lie. I just don't think M. Night maximized his potential.M. Night's films tend to be too slow and not enough pay off. Sixth Sense was the exception. This could have easily been cut down by 20 minutes. Just not enough happened to justify almost two hours. M. Night needs to raise the stakes more in his films. It's too much reality TV ""announcing the winner"" long-drawn-out moments. Get to the point quickly and then add more points.Too bad it was mostly a bore-fest because like I said, the premise was good and would have been great if he added more events and drama that led somewhere with people we actually cared for.",The Village
150,pfgpowell-1,Thoroughly entertaining but by no means a masterpiece,6,2 October 2008,"The various reviews of The Village by IMDb members follow the usual - and I am bound to say, rather unchivalrously - American pattern: it seems this is regarded either as a work of quite unparallelled genius (as in 'this week's work of quite unparallelled genius') or it stinks so much to heaven that it's a wonder the writer, director and chief bottle washer dares show his face in public. But that's the Americans for you: never like to do anything by halves. This rather reserved - Americans might say buttoned up, but they would be wrong - Brit thinks The Village is a rather entertaining, well-made horror flick, but which, at the end of the day, pulls is punches. In hindsight, the plot is so full of holes, if it were a fishing net, a shark would have no trouble escaping. But that is in hindsight: while you are watching, from the spooky opening funeral to the final scene, its rather good, very entertaining, will quite often send a pleasant chill down your spine and will keep you guessing right until the end. It is, in fact, a difficult film to write about because revealing only one of the plot twists would rather spoil the viewing of someone who is seeing it for the first time. So just let me repeat: there are twists aplenty and anyone who knows where it will all end at any point is a better man than I am. The saintly Roger Ebert gave it a very sniffy review when it was first released in 2004, and although I understand the points he raise, his judgement does seem unnecessarily stern. (And his judgement might well be questioned by asking just how much attention he was paying. He did, after all, get one plot point very wrong. The village idiot was the heroine's brother, not just some unrelated village idiot.) Certainly, this has more in common with a shaggy dog story than Macbeth, but then who says that is a crime. Look, I'm struggling to describe this film without giving anything away. Every time I think of a point, I realise that making it might ruin the film for the first-time viewer. So just let me end by saying that everyone from Joaquin Phoenix through Ron Howard's daughter to William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver acquits themselves well, Roger Deakins photography is, as usual, great, and even if the film does, in a way, cheat by (at least to this viewer) by making out it is raising a few quite interesting moral points, only to drop them one by one unceremoniously without a second thought, you could do a lot worse than spend 103 minutes watching The Village. Expect a solid piece of entertainment, not a masterpiece.",The Village

152,Gafke,Shyamalan meets the Brothers Grimm,10,5 February 2005,"This is my favorite film by M. Night Shyamalan, so far.In an isolated valley somewhere in rural Pennsylvania is a village. Life is simple and the villagers are content...for the most part. Bordering the valley on all sides are the woods, where no one may enter, for it is said that Those We Do Not Speak Of dwell within these woods, and will kill anyone who dares cross over the border. However, when young Lucius Hunt is seriously injured by a disturbed young man, his devoted betrothed Ivy Walker insist that she be allowed to go through the woods and to the towns beyond, where medicines can be purchased for Lucius. However, there are some serious problems to consider. Ivy is blind, the towns are vicious, violent places where no one is safe, and Those We Do Not Speak Of must be considered as well. If Ivy wants to save Lucius, she must learn some of the truths behind The Village, a place founded by her father for the sole purpose of creating a sanctuary for those who have suffered losses in the distant towns.A lot of people felt ripped off by this film, which turns out to have nothing to do with either horror, monsters or aliens as was the case with Shyamalan's other films. But I was expecting the dramatic final twist, because that is Shyamalan's trademark, and so I was not disappointed when it was revealed. The Village is a love story set against a Grimms Brothers backdrop. It is very much a fairy tale, complete with true love, rumors of frightening beasts, superstition and brave quests. It is also a story of hope and desperation, and though the village elders perhaps have not made the best decisions, they have made them for the right reasons. The Village is also a very beautiful film, filled with misty nights, dark woods and green fields. The effect is very calming. The village becomes a place where you wouldn't mind going yourself, and it is this atmosphere of peace and beauty that make the scares all the more effective. Joaquin Phoenix is at his best here as the quiet Lucius, a serious young man with a strong streak of compassion. Bryce Dallas Howard is amazing in her first big role, playing the blind Ivy. She is lovely and strong and totally believable. There isn't a single person in this film who does not deliver their very best performance. William Hurt as Ivy's father, Sigourney Weaver as Lucius's mother, Adrian Brody as the simple minded Noah, Brendan Gleeson, all are wonderful. If you like old fashioned fairy tales filled with darkness, innocence and love, you'll want to see The Village.",The Village
153,skybrick736,The Village 7/10,7,7 June 2015,"As good as The Village is as a film, it's pretty apparent to see here that M. Night Shyamalan started to stray away from his strong suit, the supernatural, and go towards different story lines. The Village is extraordinary just from a casting standpoint; bring the likes of Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt. Each character had to be precise and some highly articulate in order for their roles to be pulled off perfectly. It's not often to say that I felt Phoenix's character lacked while Bryce Dallas Howard portrayal of Ivy Walker was terrific. Shyamalan was lucky to get such a great group of actors and actresses for his film, along with his consistent partner and great composer, James Newton Howard. Howard's score for The Village is just as good as it was in Sings and it really sets the tone and mood for the story. Shyamalan tried to pull off a twist like The Sixth Sense with many clues, and short cut-off scenes to the past, but it just didn't get the hype he hoped for. It's not a horror film which many people thought because of what the trailer represented but an unsettling drama with only a couple intense moments. I'd still recommend The Village to anyone but I also see why so many people were disappointed because it isn't the typical Shyamalan film by any means.",The Village
154,charchuk,Slightly flawed masterpiece,8,14 March 2007,"Criminally underrated thriller. Sure, the story has its flaws. Sure, it's not really a horror. Sure, the twists are gimmicky. But this is an expertly crafted, emotionally satisfying, and incredibly thematic film. As one can expect from a Shyamalan film, the direction is near-flawless, and this is particularly evident in the true horror scenes in the film, the attack sequences. Without using cheap 'jump' scares, Shyamalan makes a scene scary and suspenseful through some terrific shot placements and effective cinematography. The music contributes quite a bit, too, as James Newton Howard adds another great score to his resume. Though the story is flawed, it's still very well-written, faltering only in certain plot mechanics; though the dialogue may turn off some, I really dug its stylized nature. The romance feels natural and works very well as the central plot device, and the main twist, though quite a leap of logic, brings up some important themes. The acting is very good, with no weak links, but a clear strong link in Bryce Dallas Howard - she's a revelation. Add in to that some great costume and production design, and you've got an absolutely fantastic film.",The Village
155,christian123,Some creepy moments but its not as good as it should have been,5,12 March 2005,"The Village has some creepy moments but its not as good as M. Night Shyamalans previous work. A tranquil 19th Century village enjoys an isolated living surrounded by woods which are home to strange creatures. For many years, they remain segregated, but one day, the villagers discover that the creatures will no longer leave them alone once an impetuous young man (Joaquin Phoenix) bravely ventures forth into the forbidden territory. The plot sounds very scary and with a talented cast this should have been a lot better. The film runs for 108 minutes but it feels a lot longer because there's a lot of boring moments. The script needed some work as there were a lot of holes and stuff that didn't make sense. The ending was good and I didn't see it coming but it also didn't make a lot of sense. The cast is great with the best being Bryce Dallas Howard, she's very talented and should will easily find work in Hollywood. Joaquin Phoenix and Sigourney Weaver both do a good job and Sigourney might be one of the most underrated actresses today. The last main person worth mentioning is Adrien Brody who does a good job but his character was really annoying. M. Night Shyamalan also does a good job of directing making The Village look and sound creepy. Even with a great cast and director the movie just didn't work as well as it should have. I do think critics were a bit harsh on this movie though as it wasn't as bad as they were saying. Rating6/10, this seems to be a hate or love it type of movie as you will either like the ending or you will hate it and feel like you have been ripped off badly.",The Village
156,kdnor2011,"Not Great, but looks great",7,1 September 2011,"The Village is that one M. Night Shymalan movie that splits people right down the middle, some like it, some don't, but not many people love it or hate it. When the trailer was first released for this film, it made the movie look like some kind of supernatural thriller, and it looked really cool. Unfortunately the trailer lied to people, the movie is actually more of a romance. Sure there are a few thriller elements in there, but people went in expecting a thriller and got a romance, and were very disappointed. Personally I like this movie, but it does have some flaws.For one, this movie can get extremely boring in a few places. And I mean almost fall asleep boring. Also, most of the characters are extremely forgettable. The two leads are fine, Sigorney Weaver is a little memorable, and you got a feel a little sorry for Noah, but the rest are just forgotten once you stop watching the movie. It gets way too overly dramatic at times, and it's a little pretensious.But the film looks fantastic, can someone please explain why Shymalan is a terrible director, every single one of his films I've seen (everyone except Praying with Anger) looks great. The lighting is great, the use of color, and every shot is done well. The acting is good for the most part. And I actually really like the twists, a lot of people, even fans of the movie don't like them, but personally I thought they were pretty good. And I like how you can analyze the film. I won't spoil anything, but the last twist brings up some questions that are worthy of being analyzed.I like the Village about as much as I liked Drive, both have great things about them, but they are dragged down by being too much about the style and getting really boring at times. So if you loved Drive, you should love this movie. Personally I like it, it isn't as good as Signs or Sixth Sense, but it is better than Lady in the Water and Unbreakable (bring on the hate.)",The Village

A beautifully told story which might frustrate haters to see it's actually possible to create something that deep while cinema is flooded with superhero flicks every quarter. In the village human dreams seem to come true only to find out evil and jealousy can be found everywhere. It's a social study about community and belonging vs egoism and crime. (Spoiler !)The residents of the village yearn for a life away from civilasation... not only geographically but also chronologically. Kudos to Mr. Shyamalan for tackling such a topic and transform it into an amazing and relevant movie experience.

158,mOVIemAN56,Chilling and Smart. Almost as good as the Sixth Sense,7,7 June 2005,"The Village is yet another horror, suspenseful film by up-and-coming director M. Night Shyamalan. The movie will keep you thinking and is brilliantly acted and written for a horror film.Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix)is a villager in a small, secluded, 19th-century town and is one of the better folk. The village is located in a valley surrounded by forest, and the villager's aren't allowed to stray from it. The forest is filled with creatures, deadly and vicious and if villagers stray into the forest they'll be killed. After the death of a villagers son, Lucius sees it ridiculous that they don't try and reach the outside towns for medicine. He is denied but an act of defiance would lead himself and his village into chaos and to the truth. Shyamalan is continuing to prove that he is a top director and an incredible storyteller. Phoenix is a bit wasted but Bryce Dallas Howard makes up for it as his blind and caring girlfriend, Ivy. Adrien Brody, however, is over-the-top brilliant in his role as the mentally-disturbed Noah.The end will catch you completely off-guard (what a surprise for Shymalan) and is thoughtfully placed. The story is just as good as Signs (2002) and is nearly as good as the Sixth Sense. It's a very good film, nothing special but still a pretty good thriller and horror film. The Village.

160,glgioia,Slooooooooooooow,6,12 January 2005,"But not bad all in all. The story of an Amish style society, told with the directors usual assortment of sight frights and skin crawlers. These mostly concern the creatures that terrorize the village by night. They are definitely scary, modeled almost exactly like the devil's henchmen in Time Bandits, those tall cloaked creatures with the cows skull heads and hook hands if you have any idea at all what I'm talking about. Gilliam was definitely onto something, because as goofy as they sound, for some reason they scare the crap out of you. Shamalyan has a gift for getting the absolute scary most in a situation, and in this film he exercises the talent generously. Here's the trouble, if you find the fright ineffective, I can almost guarantee you will hate this film, because not a whole lot else happens in it. There isn't a plot as such, its more of an examination on the way of life and the attendant troubles of a closed off society. The trouble of the creatures becomes the overriding drama, and the Twilight Zone style resolution isn't bad. Its not great however, and there's unquestionably too much ineffective dead time. Fans of this director will no doubt overlook the shortcomings and repeated themes, and enjoy one of his scarier efforts. For the average guy on the street, it might not satisfy.",The Village
161,jamiedarlow-37510,Beautifully made and poignant,9,15 March 2020,"There is a strong pact between the residents of a small isolated village and the creatures that roam in the surrounding woodland. The villagers do not go into the woods and in return the creatures do not enter the village. Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) a quiet caring man, wishes to seek the elders approval to venture to the borders to seek medical supplies. As this knowledge becomes more widespread, strange occurrences begin to happen around the village leading the elders to fear for the safety of their home and the pact. With a star-studded cast from William Hurt to Sigourney Weaver to Judy Greer, everyone brings their all to the table and elevates it to a powerhouse piece! The heart and soul of the film though is absolutely Bryce Dallas Howard in her first starring role; it's her best performance to date and she is so captivating as Ivy Walker. Her character is the entrance point for the audience emotionally and as she goes on her journey into the woods in the final act, it's a psychologically tense experience. Howard loved the role and indeed the film as she stated in the lovely DVD bonus feature 'Bryce's Diary'. Adrien Brody is also brilliant as Noah; a great portrayal of someone with learning difficulties struggling with a rivalry and his feelings for Ivy. Every character is fully rounded and developed and this is what makes the impending horror in the film all the more effective",The Village
162,Danny_G13,The most stupid and absurd film ever made?,2,14 December 2004,"Can I start by conveying my absolute disbelief that this film scored as highly as 6.5 on IMDb?The Village is the latest offering from M Night Shyamalan, and I began viewing with tredipation such is the downward spiral of his career. Sixth Sense was magnificent, Unbreakable was quirky and passable, Signs was brilliantly directed but ultimately its ending ruined it, and now this.The Village is set around the 18th century and stars Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius, a young and reserved man living in a small town. The town has a chequered past, in that there is a serious and dangerous rivalry between it and another village which mirrors it on the opposite side of a large forest which separates both. There is a tense 'ceasefire' between the villages so peace seems to be present. Indeed, in the forest itself there are dangers so the villagers *never* go in. There is also a colour code too - red represents the danger of the forest, and is forbidden in the village. However, when it seems that the truce between the 2 villages has been broken, the walls of civilization apparently begin to crack, and chaos starts to dominate life in the village.To say any more could spoil the story, so the summation will halt there. There is a good cast here; Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody make up a very strong group of actors. You are given at least decent performances by them all, but Weaver and Brody are both criminally underused and woefully miscast. Brody was the pianist for goodness sake and he's been reduced to a minor Forrest Gump-style character in this. Why on earth did he accept such a poor role? Weaver also deserves better. Little more than a peripheral character, Lucius' mother, she's truly Hollywood royalty and such a small part to play is a complete waste of her time.Phoenix is the main character along with the relatively unheard of Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy, daughter of William Hurt's Walker, and all 3 of the above are given fairly meaty roles, particularly Hurt who's by far the best thing about the Village. Howard is slightly melodramatic and sentimental, and Phoenix isn't sympathetic enough, though reasonable, as the almost autistic Lucius.Outside of the basic flaws which I'll get to later, The Village suffers pretty feeble direction. Signs was far better, and almost an exercise in how to direct a thriller. The Village, on the other hand, seems to bore with its direction, and completely lacks interest. However, the main gripe is simply the ridiculousness of it all. This is an unbelievably contrived film, which simply defies sensibilities and makes up its own rules. Being different can be good, but doing it for the sake of is really not. This film at times feels like a 15 year old is just making it up on the spot.The ending is simply vacuous and not clever at all. There is no way I can bring myself to say 'ah, so *that's* why it's been ridiculous, oh, well that's really smart then'. Believe me, I've tried.Overall this is a silly and futile film which is partially saved by Hurt, but its stupidities cost it dearly.Avoid.",The Village
163,deanofrpps,is separation from everyday life more of a state of mind?,6,18 December 2005,"We have faced the enemy and find it to be ourselves.The movie thrusts you into the apparent tranquility of a remote ante-bellum 19th century Pennsylvania village. The villagers are celebrating a communal feast and then you hear it the howl from the woods just outside the clearing. Exactly what forces of darkness are out there in the forrest that make the villagers avoid the color red and use a beigish-tan as a protected color.The movie spirals into the nature of the threat and the secret past identity of the elders, the adult villagers.The film is well recommended for its occasional cinematical brilliance in moments of tension, fear and surprise, but I think errs on one point, very perilously close to its central premise: If one transported 21st century people back to the tranquility of an era of good feeling prior to the civil war, wouldn't they be 21st century people in costume transplanted anti-modernists rather than 19th century people?

164,jackasstrange,Almost as bad as i was expecting,5,27 November 2013,"I had a curious story with this film before watching it for the first time. I avoided it like the plague in the last month, mostly due to a bad feeling about it. Seriously, i missed lots of opportunities to see this film. I generally don't listen to critics opinions and stuff, but i don't know. In this case, it's like if something were holding me back to not watch this film. But today i finally gave up , left my fears and watched The Village.Well, it wasn't as bad as i thought it was, but still, is indeed not a good film in any means in this planet. The plot is awful if you really think about it. The dialog is very vague, pointless and cheesy. 90% of them don't adds nothing to the story, which s a very bad fact. Some events requires way too many suspension of disbelief to really appreciate it. As far as i watched,a blind girl which can do absolutely everything as a normal person does and a retard smarter than people with implied much more intelligence than him are quick examples of how much you needs to suspend your disbelief. The character development is just normal, and there is no setting in any ways to be able to do this 'suspension'.The acting is not exactly in the level of what you are used to see coming from this relatively ensemble cast, but i don't put the fault entirely in the actors. They don't have that much to work with, besides the poor dialogs and the dull pointless events. The cinematography, the art design and the soundtrack are top- notch though, but a film is not only about these technical aspects.Not recommended. 5.4/10",The Village
165,Meven_Stoffat,"""What a tweeeeest""",4,14 October 2010,"Instead of dragging it out with paragraphs, I'll just list off PLENTY of the things that made this film a complete turd.-So a guy manages to (somehow) get a forest preserve, and (somehow) prevents planes from flying over it. Because it would be out of place in making the kids believe that they live in an 1800s time period. Really, Night??? -I have the most brilliant idea!!!! Let's send the blind girl to get the medicine! She's SO gonna know where she's going!!! -Somehow the blind girl manages to take down the ""thing they don't mention"" or whatever they call it. And she's so sharp she knows where it is!!!! She even heads towards it in a straight line in some bits of the showdown!!! -Let's also mention that she's SOOOOO blind, she runs at breakneck speed in the forest and manages to avoid falling into a LARGE HOLE and bumping into all the trees around her!!! And then of course, she manages to get out of the village which is protected by a huge fence!!! -So the little society of theirs is supposed to be free of violence and/or crime. Yet they set up this little scheme to scare the kids, and set up this retarded ""Red is the forbidden colour"" rule??? Excuse me for a moment, I may be a little while on this one.-On the topic of the ""red"" rule, major plot hole. For one, let's mention that the film is set in the Autumn. The leaves are red clearly, that's a problem. What about red berries on the trees? Or the CLEARLY RED CURTAINS in one of the scenes. EPIC FAIL!!!! -Basically, if these adults were as smart as they thought they were, they'd have realized their whole ""society"" didn't work, with all the death and killing around them (and not to mention the slaughter of the animals to make the monster suits) -The whole ""scaring the kids with pig suits"" thing doesn't work either. For one, Noah is the mentally insane dude, and at the end when the twist was revealed (major cop-out too), he was one of them. And they'd be dumb enough to hide a suit under the floorboards in the village loonie bin????? -Also, with nothing in the loonie bin, how on earth did Noah break the floorboards to get the suit and then escape???

It's the kind of horror where it is more existential. Like the true horror is how brutal humanity can be and that you can never escape that no matter what you do and less about actual monsters running around.I felt like this was more of a love story than anything and definitely closer to a drama with a darker story. The acting is great but they do all speak ol timey which almost seems like bad acting. This comes up later in the movie as a question I couldn't shake as to why they talk this way, can't say anymore without putting in a spoiler alert.I enjoyed this movie but people looking for something like the 6th Sense or Signs level of ""Horror"" or intensity will be disappointed.",The Village
168,AndyVanScoyoc,M. Night Shyamalan outdid himself this time... **Spoilers**,8,22 June 2005,"I will start this review off by saying that I am NOT a fan of the work of M. Night Shyamalan. In my opinion, he relies too heavily on the ""essence"" of the unexpected and the end result are stories that are only mildly eerie, but not as effective as I'm certain he planned.With that said, yes I was one of those irritating people that did not enjoy ""The Sixth Sense"" because I had it figured out from the very beginning. I picked up on the major giveaway right from the get go and therefore, the rest of the movie was a bore for me. ""Unbreakable"" nearly bored me to tears and I can't tell you when I was so disenchanted by a movie as I was with ""Signs."" However, I decided to give ""The Village a chance, and am glad that I did. The imagery that M. Night creates with the 19th century village seemingly lost in time, sort of a ""Witness,"" from a suspense movie maker's viewpoint is both chilling and strikingly realistic. Not many times have I believed in a character as I did in Ivy Walker (played with stunning realism by Bryce Dallas Howard) and I found myself creeped out far more by the people of the village than I was with what could possibly be out in the woods. Ivy Walker though, is the innocence of what humans are and one can't help but feel every pain she feels and see the world in a different light through her sightless eyes. I am not, in any way a fan of Adrien Brody, but he must also be commended for a job well done as the simple, bumbling, but oh so human, Noah Percy.The movie is not fast paced and those who expect non stop thrills and chills will be sorely let down. However, if you pay close attention to the film, you will see that each scene as it unfolds is necessary to the story, to why the elders of the village are as guarded as they are and why it is imperative that they ""keep secrets"" as Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) accuses his mother, Alice (Sigourney Weaver) of.I must admit that I did not expect the twist at the end of the movie and that led to my feeling that M. Night did actually outdo himself with this film. In all of his other movies I ""saw"" the end nearly from the beginning of the movie, and was disappointed before it ever arrived.Being a professional author, a storyline is important for me, with a work of this caliber. Your blood and guts or schlock movies, one doesn't always expect a great storyline and that's not what brings the crowd in, but for a thriller/suspense movie, a storyline that grabs the watcher is imperative. Mr. Shyamalan has succeeded in doing so with this movie and I give him all proper respect.M. Night weaves a brilliant storyline in this movie, absolutely brilliant and I would highly suggest this movie, if for no other reason, than simply for the stunning storyline.",The Village
169,cosmic_quest,"If the ending wasn't ruined beforehand, it would have been a perfect suspenseful thriller",7,20 August 2004,"While not quite as good as 'Signs' and 'The Sixth Sense', I found 'The Village' very enjoyable. It was eerily atmospheric with the usual unexpected twists M. Night Shyamalan delights in. This film is a reminder that with good camera-work and an original story, CGI and computer-added effects are not always needed.The story centres around an American village of the Nineteenth Century that is surrounded by woods inhabited with strange creatures. There is a truce between the villagers and the creatures that so long as the villagers don't wear red nor breach the woods then they will not be harmed. This truce is violated when a young blind girl has to cross through the woods to bring medicine for an injured loved one.Yes, it's a vague summary but I can't say too much without ruining the twists (which there are three of).Some critics have said they saw the ending a mile off but somehow I doubt it and I imagine these critics are the sort of people who criticise a film to make themselves look 'sophisticated' and 'intelligent'. I think Shyamalan has created another masterpiece and directed excellent performances from the cast, in particular William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard, although Sigourney Weaver did seem a little under used.One major problem is that this is the sort of film that should be released in the US and the UK on the same date. Shyamalan could find a drop in UK sales primarily because some UK cinema-goers will know exactly what the twists and may avoid the film are thanks to a number of inconsiderate American viewers who saw the film then in their reviews announced to the world what happens without leaving spoiler warnings. Therefore, I and a few of my friends went in knowing exactly what would happen, and like all of Shyamalan's films, knowing did take some of the fun from the storyline.",The Village
170,shanfloyd,Different from Shyamalan's other films... one needs to know that to appreciate it.,8,17 March 2006,"Although being a fairly good admirer of M. Night Shyamalan's previous three films I did not go to see ""The Village"" in theatres when it came out, partly because I was very busy with my work then and partly because I received negative comments from friends who saw it. I finally saw it on TV and am now regretting the fact that I missed its theatre screening.To speak things clearly, ""The Village"" is not primarily 'a suspense-horror film with a sharp ending twist' as the popular description of his films goes. It is essentially a beautiful and faithful love story in the backdrop of an unusual situation. This backdrop has those elements of suspense and horror only to enrich the story, not to contaminate it. The film's social and political undertone shows how Shyamalan is growing more mature in writing cinematic materials, with several conflicting points of view interwoven with one another. And his visionary about the village and the woods is simply amazing. That makes it a visually stylish film too. And about the so-called 'plot twist', I think it was intentionally given away much too early, otherwise the original love story would have been largely affected. One must appreciate the film's ending, even if it does not contain any 'twist' as one might expect.Bryce Dallas Howard completely steals the show with her dedicated portrayal of Ivy; I'd definitely look for her future works. Joaquin Phoenix as an actor is also nice to watch. Adrien Brody remains a little under-utilized in my opinion. And one must not forget William Hurt's excellent acting as Ivy's father.The bottomline: To watch this film and appreciate it, it must not be compared with his previous films. It does not have their elements, but it has something new to offer. Keep and open mind for that.",The Village
171,jb_campo,Thought-provoking movie,7,3 October 2015,"The village is a thought-provoking movie that deviates from the typical M Night Shyamalan, scare-the-crap-out-of-you movie like The Sixth Sense, The Happening, or Signs. Shyamalan does deliver his typical twist, that I found a bit predictable here, but I leave that part for you to decide.A village in the late 1800s/early 1900s lives in isolation from the other villages. It looks like a Quaker village, simple lives, no electricity, basic water, simple clothes. They don't allow the color red, there's some sort of aversion to it. No one is allowed to wander into the woods because there are creatures there who may attack you. The villagers stay in the village and they are safe. Or are they?Joaquin Phoenix delivers a powerful performance as Lucius, a young man who doesn't say much, but what he does exhibit is extreme courage. He is attracted to Ivy, a not-quite-totally blind girl, brilliantly acted by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard, the famous actor/director from Happy Days and Apollo 13. Their attraction is one of the key story lines. Other key story lines are Adrien Brody as Noah, somewhat of a village idiot. Something not right upstairs. This craziness borders on obsession, and that is a key part of his personality and the film.Finally, a wonderful performance from Sigourney Weaver as a single, middle-aged woman with an unobtainable attraction to William Hurt, who plays pretty much the leader of the village, Edward Walker. There is a core group of elders, who meet to discuss the direction of the village, and that is the final key storyline. Why do they meet? What do they discuss? what are these boxes they all seem to have? Intriguing.Events happen that drive action, and if you paid attention during the movie, you have an inkling of the ending. It's a collision of hearts and minds with no clear resolution, except it gives you hope that, somehow, all will work out well for the village and its people.See The Village. There is terrific acting by all, an intriguing plot, and a thought-provoking ending. Enjoy.",The Village
172,refresh_daemon,"Well directed, but the plot puts holes in the film",6,5 February 2007,"Like many of his films, M. Night Shyamalan's latest suspense film has many things going for it. For one, Shyamalan is a very talented director. He has a great grasp of what it takes to direct art and is very obviously influenced by a master, Alfred Hitchcock. His attention to artistic details, including mis-en-scene, color, kinetics, framing, diegetic manipulation and so forth are all top-rate. He peopled the film with a very capable cast. And he's very capable of plotting very twistily. This film has a great number of surprises and if you don't like being fooled, you will not like this film. Despite the fact that you go in knowing that there will be a very major plot twist, he still gets you. That's impressive.Of course, there are some glaring problems with this work. First of all, the dialogue is filled with excessive verbiage and unnatural phrasing. It's not quite inane, like Lucas' latest endeavors and fortunately, after being immersed in it long enough, you stop noticing it, but it immediately distances the viewer. Secondly, it's lacking in story. True, Shyamalan is a very capable plotter, but when it comes to providing a strong and compelling story, this film lacks it. Motivations and characters don't always follow correctly and he creates a particular character, seemingly because he needed that character to tie his plot together, which takes away from the writing's credibility and also threatens to expose his plot--which I was usually able to keep ahead of.the plot, although at times, I was indeed fooled like most. Lastly, the film isn't able to keep itself controlled because of the need to follow the plot. Holes exist and inconsistencies appear that aren't really explainable, despite my attempts to defend them.When the film ended, I thought I saw one beautifully directed, well acted, but ultimately shallow film, particularly because of the emphasis on plot over story. With the right co-writer or script, I think he's going to be capable of a whole lot more, but I think it's time to take the actual storywriting a little bit out of his hands. It helped the aforementioned Lucas, it will likely help Shyamalan. Still, as far as a suspense thriller with a whole lot of surprising craziness and strong direction, it remains quite watchable. But I'm guessing it will be a divisive film to its audience. 6/10. Make your own call.",The Village
173,jpintar,Very Good,7,30 July 2004,"I don't know what to say about The Village without giving anything away.  I thought this movie was very well done and is definitely an improvement over some other summer fare like Catwoman.  The Village is not as good as Signs or Unbreakable, but it is still very interesting to watch.  Unfortunately, the secret of this movie will be figured by the average moviegoer after about an hour or so, diminishing the movie's impact.  The secret will no doubt disappoint fans of Night's previous movies.  What makes the movie worth watching the movie are exceptionally good performances by Phoenix, Howard, Hurt, and Weaver.  In the hands of lesser actors, this movie would have been overwhelmed by its weaknesses.  My overall score is 7/10.",The Village
174,Jacques98,Best Shyamalan I've seen.,5,6 September 2008,"It's unlikely that this movie will scare you, but I don't see how people can deny the amazing storytelling this movie has. It switches genres at least three times within the movie, and unlike The Happening, this isn't drawn-out or cheesy.The first twist comes mid-way and it is amazing because it is something most movies wouldn't dare to do. It's cliché-defying and different. When the second twist comes, the cheesy elements of the story all fall away and it turns into a weird thriller unlike anything I've ever seen.I get why people hate it based on their love for his older work. I totally understand that. But if you're a newcomer to Shyamalan with low expectations, this is probably the best of his movies to start with.5/10",The Village
175,SamJamie,"A solid, original & underrated film.",8,5 December 2020,"Members (Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody) of a 19th-century community fear the strange creatures that inhabit the surrounding forest.For me, M. Night Shyamalan delivered again with the Village, an utterly accessible and enthralling film. The film works because of its subtle mood, tone and style, like Hitchcock, most of what's typically scary are kept off-screen and in darkness, which in this desensitized world, makes them all the more frightening. The films sets, outfits and props are gorgeously made, making the film amazingly atmospheric, add this to the films the outstanding ensemble cast - led by Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy who in my opinion delivers the best performance in the film, every moment she is on screen it keeps the film fresh, touching, and real.",The Village
176,tburke85,The Village A Period Drama Disguised As A Horror/Thriller,4,5 June 2009,"The Village is a period drama disguised as a horror/thriller from writer/director M Night Shyamalan whose other films haven't been nearly as good as his first one The Sixth Sense. M. Night shows talent and skill with the Village but unfortunately the bad outweighs the good in this one. The Village really isn't that bad but it could've been much better. The trailer to the film makes it seem like a thriller but I found The Vilage to be more of a period drama with some thriller elements. The movie does have some secrets that were surprising others weren't so much but surprises like spectacle alone doesn't make an entertaining film. The cast for the most part are believable in their roles of a small community of people who live in fear of the ""creatures"" that live in the woods surrounding their village. Joaquin Phoenix is admirable as Lucius the soft spoken man whose curious about the world outside of their village community. Phoenix however isn't in it that much considering his role gets cut rather short and for the remainder of the movie it focuses mainly on a female character played by newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard the daughter of famous director/actor Ron Howard. Bryce is quite good as Ivy a beautiful and determined blind young woman. She brings some life into the movie and without her I would've given it a lower rating that I did. Well done. Adrien Brody does an okay job as Noah the village idiot whose role like Phoenix is limited but he is convincing in the small part he plays in the film. The rest of the talented cast including William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleason, and Michael Pitt are very good in their roles but they (like Phoenix and Brody) also lack screen time. The few scares in the movie if you want to call them that are well executed but those scenes lack suspense and didn't frighten me at all. The creatures looked cool but like some of the characters in the film they aren't in it that much and don't pose as a real threat to the village people. The music by James Newton Howard is fitting for the tone of the film and the location they chose for the village was excellent. The ending was all right but it didn't make up for what already happened before in the movie. If M Night had improved on the scares making them more suspenseful and more frequent than The Village would've been a pretty good thriller. Overall the film is a flawed attempt at a thriller the lacked suspense but if you've enjoyed M. Night's other movies than you might like this as well.",The Village
177,anhedonia,Here's the twist: This film's a terrible bore,2,4 August 2004,"Someone forgot to tell writer cum director M. Night Shyamalan that creepy, horror movies should be creepy and frightening.Despite an intriguing premise, ""The Village"" is one of the most tepid, slow-moving, humorless and uninspiring horrors I have seen in a very long time. Forget being scared; you're likely be snoozing during the few moments that pass for scary in this film because much of it's such a yawn.The blame falls squarely on Shyamalan. He might be a skilled director, but he needs to hire a talented screenwriter to pen his stories. He's obviously so enamored by his own writing that he fails to realize his script's flimsy drivel, at best. Apparently none of his actors - and there are some good ones (William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver and Brendon Gleeson) - bothered to point out the script's weak construction and incredible banality.I don't mind Shyamalan taking an hour or so to set up his story. But did that hour have to be so tedious and not contain anything truly unnerving? He's a one-trick pony and proves it, yet again. Everyone knows his movies have a major twist at the end. That's all there is to his work and he lacks the courage to change. Then again, why should he if audiences keep admiring his work not realizing it's the same, stale formula over and over again?He aims to prey on our fear of the unknown, to evoke eeriness much in the vein of Hitchcock or Henri-Georges Clouzot. Great idea. But Shyamalan's become so obvious, there's little point in our investing anything in his characters. Why should we? We know what's coming. Hitchcock and Clouzot toyed with our feelings and emotions; they gave us stories and monsters to believe in and we bought into their premises. Their films were genuinely creepy and suspenseful.Shyamalan's found a formula that worked in ""The Sixth Sense"" - I wasn't a huge fan of the film, but it showed promise - and now simply retreads the same tired blueprint that essentially destroys any suspense in his stories.Here, he telegraphs the twist so early, you'd be hard-pressed not to figure it out. Even if you don't, it's so terribly ho-hum you're astonished he's that shallow and unoriginal a writer. There's his customary cameo, a la Hitchcock, and Shyamalan even gives himself a line of dialogue to justify his story's horrendously hokey premise.Young Bryce Dallas Howard brings an honesty to her performance that, frankly, is unwarranted and wasted in this movie. Don't spend much time thinking about Brody's character. He completely defies logic.The true mystery here is what possessed Hurt, Weaver and Gleeson to star in this film. Hurt does his best somnambulist impression, while Weaver and Gleeson get to do nothing substantial. Extras could have played their roles without diminishing the film any.""The Village"" contains nothing spine-chilling or suspenseful anywhere. There's one honestly surprising moment - not frightening, but dramatic and well executed. Another scene promised much, but Shyamalan doesn't have faith in his actors to let it to linger a few seconds longer. It's a shame because Howard's vulnerability hooked us. Shyamalan deflates the moment by cutting away too early, promptly pumping up the overwrought violin score and resorting to pretentious slow-motion photography.Shyamalan's teetering on being tagged a hack. I don't doubt he's a talented chap. But if he wants to prove he's a good suspense filmmaker, not someone who simply recycles a hackneyed formula, he'll have to make a scary film that doesn't rely on humdrum storytelling techniques and cheap tricks that have long since worn out their novelty.",The Village

A Hitchcockian Flare for Mounting Tension & Drama. A Beautifully Woven Political Fable. A Powerful Love Story. And Those We Do Not Speak Of...There will be NO spoilers in this review!I was robbed today... Robbed of a once in a lifetime opportunity. I was robbed by an idiot projectionist. Only a handful of directors have earned my trust enough to merit an early morning Friday visit to the local multiplex. I decided to catch the very first showing of M. Night Shyamalan's latest thriller, 'The Village'. Not only that, but the local AMC had a digital projection copy of the film. I was delighted and eager to see this long awaited movie.I sat down in my chair, having decided to skip the popcorn stand because I am on a diet and because the line was too long. The screen was black... the lights were out... and a handful of other patrons showed up ten minutes early like me. Then, without warning, the screen lit up with a scene of some sort. I wasn't sure what I was watching until twenty or thirty seconds in. I recognized a familiar face. And then the realization slowly hit me... I was watching the very final moments of 'The Village'. The @#$!!)(@@ projectionist was messing around with the frame alignment and had accidentally begun playing the climax of the film. I was furious to say the least, and after explaining to the manager what had happened, I was promptly offered two free passes to any films of my choice in the coming weeks.I was reasonably satisfied with the proposal, but I was utterly devastated to have my first viewing of this secretive film ruined by some pimple-popping moron. It is something that can never be regained unless you live in the world of Jim Carrey's 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'.All that being said... I find it even more remarkable that, with the big secret given away, M. Night Shyamalan's 'The Village' still managed to send shivers down my spine and give me a million goose bumps. It is his mastery of storytelling and mood and pace that has made him such a brilliant director in such a short amount of time. Very few directors have ever had their first four major films be this stellar. 'The Village' may be the best of the lot and is easily one of the best films you will see all year.It is impossible to talk specifically about the plot without giving anything away. So if I talk in utter vagaries, please forgive me. In a village enclosed by mysterious woods, a group of a hundred or so people reside peacefully. They appear to be early American settlers, perhaps pilgrims or an Amish community. The film is very vague about those details.William Hurt plays Edward Walker, the patriarch of this community. He is one of the elders, a group of adults who act as a council for the village. Joaquin Phoenix is Lucius Hunt, a quiet loner who is tempted to enter the forbidden woods. He is thwarted though by the elders who teach of creatures that live in the woods. The creatures are referred to as ""Those we do not speak of...""Newcomer, Bryce Dallas Howard is Lucius' love interest Ivy Walker. She is blind but seems to see and feel more than many of those around her. She is a feisty girl who recognizes Lucius' feelings without him ever expressing them verbally. She feels his presence and associates him with a color whenever he is near. There is a touching scene where he finally expresses to her that he only ever feels fear when he thinks she may be in danger. Theirs is a burgeoning relationship that grounds the film with real emotions.I will not reveal the plot points in the final half of the film only to say that due to a terrible circumstance someone is forced to enter the woods and travel to get help. The storytelling techniques that Shyamalan uses in this film are simply brilliant. Unlike his other three films, the focus in 'The Village' is less on the final revelation and ""big twist"" than it is on the journey to get there. This film is a masterclass of screen writing and plot development.If there is one quibble I have with the film, it is in the character development. The film could have been thirty minutes longer to give us more clarity in each of the lead characters. But this film is more about story and fable and suspense and mood than it is about individuals. Someday soon, Shyamalan will develop into a brilliant creator of characters... He is already a consummate artist when it comes to creating story and visuals.The acting is uniformly good. Everyone plays their part with stoic aim. The one stunning standout is the revelation of Bryce Dallas Howard. The daughter of director, Ron Howard, delivers one of the best major film debuts in recent memory. She is the emotional anchor of this film and those emotions are played out exquisitely on her gorgeous face. Her portrayal of Ivy is one of the best performances of 2004. I think she should be Oscar nominated. It is clear to me that, if she chooses to follow the film path, we have found a new great actress for the coming generation. What a lovely and inspired find by M. Night!I have read some early reviews from other major critics. Most notably a terribly misguided review from my favorite critic, Roger Ebert. There are other reviews out there who lament that they saw the twist too far in advance or that the film was too somber. I am dumbfounded by their remarks. Did they miss the glorious cinematography? Did they miss the lovely interwoven political message (Which I will leave you to decipher)? Did they miss the tremendous performance of Bryce Dallas Howard? Did they miss a carefully crafted story whose tension mounts patiently? Did they miss the gorgeous use of strings in the soundtrack? Did they miss the fact that this film is so much better than the routine schtick we get week in and week out. Were their expectations skewed by Shyamalan's previous outings?I think that if this was Shyamalan's first film, the same mediocre reviews would be glowing recommendations. This is the classiest of his four great films and his least sensationalistic. He is maturing with each and every cinematic venture. If he keeps up this curve for another 20 years, M. Night will soon discussed in the same breath as Alfred Hitchcock. There are a handful of better filmmakers out there right now, but I can't think of a better storyteller than he.'The Village' is a first rate film. I highly suggest that you avoid hearing details or rumors about this movie before seeing it. I wouldn't want your virgin viewing experience robbed. I think time will prove me right over the Roger Ebert's of this world. This film will stand the test of time and serves as yet another stepping stone to greatness for Mr. Shyamalan. 'The Village' will assuredly contend for a spot in my Top Ten Films of 2004.",The Village
180,rlaine,Work of an artist,10,18 October 2010,"To me, three movies from Shyamalan stand above others. The Sixth Sense was scary, Signs was extremely entertaining and finally The Village is a work of audiovisual art and emotion. Rest of Shyamalans movies didn't have as much impact on me, altho I may need to return to Unbreakable one day.There are summer movies, winter movies, and of course spring and autumn movies. The Village is a definite autumn movie, like Hitchcocks The Trouble With Harry. The color scheme is amazing, all the tones of yellow from cold bleak woods to warm light of the candles. Everything accented with dark shadows and occasional reds. This is one of the most beautiful movies to ever hit the screens.The soundtrack is also amazing with the violin played by Hilary Hahn. The sounds are a perfect companion to the cold late autumn visuals. The ""Those we don't speak of"" scene may just be one of the greatest moments on film. The combination of sound and visuals is breathtaking.The story has been bashed many times. In a movie with such powerful artistic touch, I don't see the plot that important, but I also don't see many faults there. There are a few scenes, which may seem a bit ""fantasylike"" and one unnecessary explanation, but despite these, it's a very clever and well thought of story. Shyamalan must have exercised his brain really hard to make the story work, and in my mind he succeeded very well.Even tho there is a twist in the end, the movie is not completely dependent on it, unless you yourself put all emphasis on it. If you do, you may feel a bit let down, because it's not 100 % in your face revelation. If you only expect the movie to drop you off your chair in the end, you will miss a lot, as this is a movie of emotion and subtle nuances.It would be fun to see this movie again, without ever seeing it before and never having heard anything about it. Now I feel the first time I saw it was ruined a bit by all the negative hype. As it is, I find myself returning to this movie at least once a year, even if I know the story already.",The Village
181,MovieGuy109,Utter trash,1,28 October 2011,"The Village-*-Worthless- Directed by: M. Night Shyamalan. Written by: M. Night Shyamalan, Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Bryce Dallas Howard, Brendan Gleeson, Cherry Jones, John Christopher Jones, Celia Watson, Judy Greer, Jayne Atkinson, Fran Kranz, Michael Pitt, Jesse Eisenberg, Frank Collison.Director M. Night Shyamalan's downward spiral begins with this horrendous film that is absolutely preposterous and ridiculous in every sense of the word. The film details a village that somehow is alienated from society with people kept within the borders because of outsiders that lurk in the surrounding forest. The elders of the village refuse to let anyone outside of the borders even at Phoenix's demands.This is not only a silly plot but it is relentlessly downbeat with no factor of entertainment whatsoever. Shyamalan takes all the energy out of the film to meet his own demands to emphasize the villager's loneliness. I did not feel any loneliness from his direction and actually felt more entitled to leave this film than anything. The actors seem just as bored as the audience in reality. No one seems to be enjoying any of their roles.Shyamalan is intent upon making the same success that The Sixth Sense brought in for him. The elements that Shyamalan used in The Sixth Sense can be found though they are not even scarcely close to the sheer power his first spooky fest had over us. The end plot twist here only demeans the experience, rather than enhancing it. Shyamalan really should have identified that his talent as a director were virtually limited to one film. He is just making spin-offs now.",The Village
182,Chalice_Of_Evil,When you're desperate for medical supplies and your village is in the middle of a forest far away from civilization - send the blind girl for help...,9,16 July 2010,"I was SO glad that I took a chance, and saw this film at the theatre. Not only was I pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it, but it also introduced me to Bryce Dallas Howard - for which I'm forever grateful. She left a lasting impression with her role in this movie, playing Ivy Walker - a blind girl who ""sees"" (but just not as we see), Bryce is quite a wonder to behold. People will complain how, for a supposedly ""blind"" person, she manages to get around pretty easily/know where she's going and seems fairly familiar with her surroundings. If you actually pay attention, you will hear that she was not born blind. She obviously got to know the place where she grew up and familiarized herself with her surroundings/how to get places before she lost her sight. Even after that, she still ""sees"" people's ""colours"". So there's actually an explanation for the way she gets around, you just have to listen.At its heart, this movie is a tale of romance (in its purest form). What holds the movie together is the love story between Bryce's Ivy Walker and Lucius Hunt (portrayed perfectly by Joaquin Phoenix. No wonder he's a perfect fit - as the role was apparently written for him). It's also no wonder that Shyamalan cast Bryce without an audition from her and after only having seen her on stage. She's quite the find. Her chemistry with Phoenix is a large part of what makes the film work. There's a purity and innocence to their love for each other. Their interaction/dialogue really gets to the heart of what love is/should be about. I especially liked her trust in him and his faithfulness and loyalty to her.The rest of the cast also does well. William Hurt is excellent as Ivy's father, Sigourney Weaver is quite good as Lucius's mother, and Brendan Gleeson is great as always (though a little underused). Meanwhile, Adrien Brody has a tough role, playing Noah Percy (who is literally ""the village idiot""). He'll probably get on some people's nerves, while some might just find him unintentionally amusing. I thought he played the role well, and I even felt a twinge of sympathy for him. Judy Greer is also good as Ivy's sister, Kitty (and she shares one especially amusing scene with Lucius. Both she and Phoenix are excellent in the scene where she makes her feelings known to him). Apart from the wonderful relationships of lovers, father and daughter and mother and son, there's also the love/relationship between two sisters on display.The film itself looks great. Very moody and atmospheric, nicely gloomy and cast-over. The night scenes are brilliantly done - taking full advantage of shadows and the only light source being candles. I just cannot say enough about how good this film looks. It creates the sort of place one would almost want to step into, walk around in and be a part of. It has a mystical sort of quality to it, yet everything is grounded in a 'reality' of sorts.Speaking of, the elements to this film that may feel 'supernatural' in nature are actually handled really well. There is an explanation for everything that happens in the film, but like with all good movies, you can't expect answers straight away. You have to pay attention and be willing to go along for the ride all the way. Obviously, after Shyamalan's other movies, people are expecting a 'twist'. Thing is, if you go into this movie for the sole purpose of *looking* for what the twist might be, then chances are you may figure it out. I myself went into the film not actively seeking out the twist, and was able to sit back and just enjoy the movie for the story it had to tell. The 'twist ending' is not the main thing you should be worrying about here. It's the story that matters - and it was a story that I thoroughly enjoyed. Some may possibly feel that the film just sort of ends abruptly, but I think that if you've been paying close enough attention to the journey that the character of Ivy Walker goes through, you'll realise that the somewhat open-ended final scene can only have one natural resolution. It's really left up to you to decide, but I know that I was happy with how I thought the film ended.It is one of those cases where you either 'get' the film or you don't. And I absolutely 'got' it. It addresses issues about today's society and makes you really think about what the world has come to. What are people - as a whole - like nowadays? Not exactly the best examples of human nature are on display in today's day and age. People, in general, are deeply flawed, and The Village ponders what could be done about that to escape the unpleasantness. I very much appreciated this film and, after having recently re-watched it yet again on DVD, I love it just as much as I did the first time I saw it at the theatre (maybe even a little more). Out of all of Shyamalan's films that he's done, this one is easily my favourite. It's a truly under-appreciated gem of a film.",The Village

THAT ROGER DEAKINS CINEMATOGRAPHY GOODNESS! WOW, WOW, WOW!
Shyamalan writes just the dandiest of characters. Blind Dallas Howard for the win.
Joaquin Phoenix is a god who can save any mess of a film. That is if, theoretically, this mess of a film has him present throughout the entire movie...
Directing of the camera is miraculous. Shows you Shyamalan isn't vacant in terms of his magical talents quite yet.
Costumes, props, etc. are spruce.
Neat twist!
Even neater second twist!The Shyamabull:
Most of the dialogue and delivery from the actors/actresses are awkwardly ATROCIOUS.
A ton of character actions/decisions make zero sense. Many ""whys?"" were spoken that day in my TV room.
Transitions are seriously spontaneous.
The police officer's acting and just his character in general is a sin on its own.
Plot. Hole. Galore.
Last scene is an ""eh"" way to end the movie.The Kajillion Shyamalanian Twists (Spoiler Warning):
Joaquin Phoenix is not actually dead... after getting stabbed...multiple times.... somehow....
Red = Blood. Symbolism. Boom.
The monsters aren't real and are just the Elders playing ""Trick or Treat""! Cute!
The magical rocks aren't actually magical rocks and are just used to trick gullible villagers who don't know the ""secret"". Thank golly.
Adrien Brody is actually the monster hunting down Ivy. Shyamalan tried to ploy us into thinking he was a real monster even though the film literally just revealed that the monsters (who all wear the same exact costume designs) aren't real, only in history books. Cheap move man. Cheap move.
The villagers were unconsciously Amish the whole time and the Elders were just some traumatized hippies who meet in therapy camp! Now that's a truly clever Shyamatwist!
Simple medicine is all you need to save a person's life-even for anyone who gets stabbed a billion times.The Village is ethically one of the most difficult films I've ever had to rate. The film is frankly, ingenious within-some-of it's plot, but has too much brainless, unsystematic garbage in it for it to pound anywhere near Shyamalan at his height. So with that said, this is the fairest grade I could come up with for M. Night's, The Village: (Verdict: C+)",The Village
184,harrylosborne,Ignore the Shyamalan stigma - this is a gem,8,28 May 2019,"In recent years, M Night Shyamalan's reputation has taken a serious beating, having directed universally panned Razzy films (such as The Last Airbender and The Happening), and even some recent successes (Split, Glass) haven't been enough to salvage his career. However, slightly earlier in his directorial filmography sits this genuine horror-mystery masterpiece, criminally underrated and judged undeservedly.The Village is a different take on a horror trope, detailing an isolated community's resolve against a hidden threat in the surrounding forest. As this genre goes, the cast does not get any better: Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody and Brendan Gleeson all feature prominently, as well as relative unknowns Jesse Eisenberg and Dallas Bryce Howard in some of their earlier roles. All are individually excellent and well-cast, perfectly depicting the repressed fear of a society without outside influences.The plot of is consistent and of genuine quality, which doesn't often translate in the horror genre; however, do not be dissuaded by the premise of horror - The Village plays more off the resulting drama than cheap jump scares, and slow burns until the revelations in the second half blow the script open. The forest village is the ideal setting for this hidden evil, sparsely populated and somewhat bleak - the integral use of red and yellow elevate the cinematography further, making the environment more distressing.The Village should be a must-watch purely on the merit of the plot: some may not connect with the subtleties of the script and the nuances of the story, but those who take the time to invest will be thoroughly rewarded with a quality film.",The Village
185,wnterstar,Sublimely Creepy,8,6 April 2006,"This is a hard movie to review, because I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone.It is a subtle, slow-paced movie, with standout cinematography, and a fairly decent twist at the end. The cast is amazing, bu the standout for me was Bryce Dallas Howard, who proves that talent does run in families (her father is Ron Howard). The rest of the cast brings with them formidable resumes, and they live up to expectations.The critics panned this movie, and I can see why, but I also think that they were a bit hard on it because they have come to expect more of M. Night Shyamalan (who, as usual, has a small part in the movie!) I think if it had been made by anyone else, they wouldn't have been quite as hard on it.I will say that I did see the twist coming, but knowing didn't lessen any of the enjoyment for me.",The Village
186,PetarNeo,Pretty twisty,8,22 December 2016,"Group of people lives in isolated place surrounded by forest and as you learn couple of secrets and discover new things everything starts to unravel and secrets come out. Slowly you start to get feeling of place and how isolated it feels and creepy moments multiply the experience but then characters come to play and they are even more terrifying. Place looks like bunch of secrets, dark dark secrets lies in there and it is very intimidating. Ivy and Lucius slowly start to get hold of each other as movie progresses and it turns into a romance and Noah is a guy with some kind of mental disorder that has unspoken intentions. Lucius is one of the bravest in the village and his will to be different is amazingly shown throughout movie. Accident that has affected Lucius now forces some doubts and questions so Ivy is the one to act. Learning horrifying things, considering she is blind, she doesn't give up on anything and it gives a nice storyline after in the movie. There isn't much that can be said to unravel secrets that movie hides but definitely when they start to get out there are massive consequences. Ending was something that was pretty unexpected but in the other hand somehow good and gave some power to the story. Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius and Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy were amazing and gave a very good performances. 3/4",The Village
187,g-hbe,Captivating,8,29 August 2006,"Despite what the marketing men might have you believe, this is NOT a horror film. Like Shyamalan's other movies 'Unbreakable' and 'Sixth Sense', this is a story with a deep vein of melancholy. Some scenes are done with very little (if any) dialogue and just a couple of actors speaking whole stories with nothing but looks and tiny gestures, and the effect (as in the breakfast scene in Unbreakable) can be shattering. Reviewers here who have said things like ""this story of a village being scared of monsters outside is so childish/crude/predictable...' must have stopped watching after the first half hour or have no idea of subtlety. The story itself cleverly moves from a fairly standard scary tale to an unsettling story of despair and hope, and the uplifting ending is enough to put a further twist on our already stretched emotions. Shyamalan is very adept at getting small but extremely moving performances out of his actors, and once again it is this subtlety that (for me) is so effective.SPOILER FOLLOWS: A beautiful film - even the 'monsters' (which of course turn out to be anything but...) have a beauty about them, with their bright red cloaks and the spines. It's a love story, not a horror film.",The Village
188,Dragonsouls,Quality filmaking.,8,1 August 2004,"Part 1:  Night's 4th film was probably his worst, but still an above average movie. First off all, the acting. The large cast was great, usually Night works with small cast. This time he has more people to direct. Good acting all across the board. His camera work was phenomenal. His trademark still shots, camera's do not move often in some shots, awkward angles, signature reflection off glass shots, remember young Samuel Jackson staring at a TV in Unbreakable? Or the Alien popping up on the Tv in signs? Shyamalan makes a brief appearance in this one too, except he is the one shown in the glass this time. I love how he uses that red color in most of his films. Notabably in the sixth sense. Part 2:  This movie was suspensful of course. Not like Signs but a little more realistic and predictable. I predicted the surprise ending after 1 hour into viewing the film, and also predicted The sixth sense also. Unbreakable was Night's only film that shocked me in the end. Signs was a message movie, and more thought provoking. The funny thing is , I predicted the end of this movie but it was almost as if Night added something more suspenseful in this movie just incase the audience caught on. Not up to par with his previous films, but still an outstanding script, concept, and creation of suspense. An amazing filmmaker!",The Village

In this movie it centers around an isolated Amish-like close-knit community who's being terrorized by mythical creatures. The people call the creatures, ""Those we don't speak of"".

Joaquin Pheonix was great in this, it's amazing how he has matured as an actor over the years.Adrien Brody's character Noah Percy was the main attraction.

I was expecting a horror film lead by the amazing Joaquin Phoenix. What I got was a boring dialogue film, lead by Bryce Dallas Howard. She plays a blind girl, with the worst acting talents ever. I kept asking myself, is her character really blind or did I mishear something. As she could run and beat monsters up, like she had perfect vision. Adrien Brody is in this film. Unfortunately he plays the town idiot. Wasting his amazing acting talents on a dumb role. The twist at the end did nothing for me, except look silly.",The Village

The story here is a deeply felt idea about the desire to create a new society at any cost- and the incident that is about to break the whole community, is action caused by nothing but pure love and jealousy. But the overall vague depiction of the village people (many characters ring too hollow) isn't enough to hit this as a full home-run.

Even the monster scenes are so brief, I thought the tension could have been built a little more there.The film has a good twist at the end, but I give it a 6.0/10.0 for not having the rewatchability of other better movies.

193,johnny-08,Look deeper,7,21 November 2007,"When this movie came out I went in cinema to watch it, and I didn't find it very interesting at first view. Then I watched it again on TV and it really intrigued me. Shyamalan is great director and people cannot expect of him to make movie like ""The Sixth Sense"" every time. ""The Village"" isn't definitely his best movie but this also isn't his worst movie. ""The Village"" has its positive attributes, like great entering and solid story but maybe poor finishing. Slow rhythm of the movie is great cause we really need to be drawn into the story on this way. I also want to say that this is no horror, it is more drama of people who live in one community on traditional way. Study of characters is great just like actors are (especially Bryce Dallas Howard). Shyamalan wanted to show the thoughts of the whole community we're talking about. They gave up from real world so they can create their perfect world. Even when someone gets hurt, he's only making a sacrifice for future of the society. The question that director puts in front of us is this: Would Lucius stay alive if Ivy wasn't blind or would elders let Ivy out for medicine if she wasn't blind? And that is the point of this movie.I recommend to watch this Shyamalan movie and then judge it. In my case after second view a whole new perspective was opened to me. To all second viewers: look deeper.",The Village
194,ilovedolby,Superb Motion Picture!,9,5 August 2004,"Rather than dwell on the plot, or possibly make a revelation in this review that would ruin your experience in being shocked or drawn in by this film, I choose to write this review solely on the message and concepts addressed in `The Village' alone. If you want a plot summary, you can read them online, or go the website listed above.M. Night Shyamalan's `The Village' is certainly one of the most impressive films to be released this summer. The story, however, is not what you will expect-perhaps the only thing ever to expect from Shyamalan's films. But moreover, the movie ends on a note that is not acceptable to the average filmgoer: one of the reasons why so many people are not enjoying the movie. But why should an unconventional ending deter a moviegoer's experience or enjoyment? After all, movies that have come from the greatest filmmakers ever have been unconventional. Imagine a film by Stanley Kubrick ending on a happy note, with a swelling score and every actor on the screen walking away into the sunset with smiles on their faces. It just does not fit Kubrick's style, as is the case with Shyamalan. With four major features under his belt, Shyamalan seems to be developing a pattern. With `The Sixth Sense,' we end on a note of truth and acceptance for that truth. It is a hopeful ending. With `Unbreakable,' we end with truth, but the world that we inhabit remains dark and sinister. `Signs,' like `The Sixth Sense' ends on a note of hope for the future and resolution with the past. Now, we have `The Village,' which ends on a note of darkness. There is resolution, but the characters remain static-many knowing that there is a truth beyond the borders of their village, but choosing not to be a part of it. Furthermore, keeping it a secret from those who trust them. There are three major messages that I took away from this movie relating to fear, escapism and good intentions. First, the concept of fear-just like F.D.R. said, `we have nothing to fear but fear itself.' Shyamalan has used this concept in all of his movies, in one form or another. In `The Village,' fear is used to keep the people in-line with the rules and ways set forth by the village elders. That fear, it is believed by the elders, will protect the village people from not only the others that they fear beyond their woods, but from themselves. Moreover, by developing a credible fear in the populace, those who govern are able to control their people into believing in their goals and aspirations by making them afraid of a threat that is actually not as great as they make it out to be. This message was also made present in another summer blockbuster, `Fahrenheit 9/11.'	 The second message that Shyamalan addresses is that of escapism in the wake of some great grief. This is a common belief in society, as well as historically. It is documented that after the death of his wife and mother, Theodore Roosevelt took to the American west in search of relief from sadness.  People believe that somehow they can escape some great emotional pain by filling the void with an adventure or new way of living. Rarely, if ever, is this the case. Grief and despair at some point or another will find a person, regardless of where and how they live their lives.	Lastly, the concept that good intentions are not enough is addressed. Good intentions have been used throughout history to rally people against a supposed evil or danger. A perfect example is that of the Vietnam War, or the Great Leap Forward in China. Reasons for intentions have to be analyzed and thought out well with the consequences weighed. If not, all the good intentions of the greatest individuals in the world could bring about their own and many other's downfall. 	In terms of filmmaking alone, `The Village' is great. The performances are excellent. The score from James Newton Howard with violin solos by Hilary Hahn are eloquent. And it would not be a Shyamalan film without seeing the director in at least one scene, which has an excellent use of mise-en-scene. ***1/2",The Village
195,huh_oh_i_c,It's an IKEA movie!,8,2 May 2007,"********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* ********* I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING!!! ********* ********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* ********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* ********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* ********* HUGE SPOILER! ********************* This movie is completely based on the idea that ""In olden days, everything used to be better"". Today, there is a cultural undertow, which holds that we should 'go back', and its most present manifestation is in the IKEA way of designing things. IKEA wants you to give you a feeling of solid un-modernity, oldfashionedness, that's why all their most successful designs are those woody wood-wood chests and cupboards and tables.The people who have founded the village, also have this notion of fleeing modern life. And that that is somehow better. But, as one character notes, there is sorrow there as well as in the 'towns'. And the sacrifice of living unmodern is made clear at the beginning of the movie, when a boy dies of some treatable disease, age seven.All this is not to say, that I don't think this isn't a beautiful movie. It is, as all movies by Shymalan I have seen (Signs, Unbreakable and in a way the Sixth Sense) a film of devastating minimalistic beauty. The movie is in no small way helped by the crystal beauty of Howard, whose acting skills are remarkable.Also, the music of superstar violinist Hahn is completely in line with the films intentions and meaning. Well worth watching.===== Remember, you're unique. Just like everyone else. ========",The Village
196,gazineo-1,A Sociological Tale,6,10 September 2004,"'Village,The' is directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who gave to us the blockbuster 'Sixth Sense' maybe one of the most famous movies with a supernatural theme of all times. Shyamalan is a director with a style, maybe a project: to develop movies about ordinary peoples (like the character played by Mel Gibson in 'Signals')involved in uncanny and weird situations. In fact, it's a interesting aspect in his career, because it's very rare to find a filmmaker with a definite style and a personal way of telling stories and artistically worked upon the reality. But Shyamalan was not completely successful in this challenge. Some of his films - especially the uninspired and silly 'Signals' - resulted in a great deception and frustration. His new movie - 'Village,The' - although not a great movie, give to him a new chance to find a good way to carry on. But 'Village,The' is a chance of mood. In the bottom line, it's not a supernatural tale, even with the touches of evil creatures, fear, and fragility of human being in front of the unknown. The movie is, in fact, a sociological comment about human nature, an interesting - although a little far fetched and not original - methapora about political force and the means used by society to estabilish control over mankind, here included fear, violence and general ignorance. The movie hits some of it's goals with competence and Shyamalan, at least, shows to the audience that the uncanny is not just made of ghosts, ET's and heroes of comic books. We, men and women, are so weird and frightful as the strange creatures of his previous movies.",The Village

198,ryan_kuhn,"""Heed the warning bell, for they are coming.""",6,23 July 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan has made some of my favorite movies: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs. Now he has written another movie that has what is now known as the ""twist ending,"" something he is becoming synonymous with in The Village. I wouldn't dare give away the quick turn to the left the movie takes, but I will say, it disappoints to a degree. It is not a ridiculous ending, but what could have been if Shyamalan had trusted his original premise of a 1890s Pennsylvania countryside village terrorized by creatures who patrol the surrounding woods. We get the usual eerie mood that Shyamalan has given us before. The Village excels in the isolating feeling that we got in Signs. I might be the only person to admit to liking Signs, but I appreciated the humanized battle between one family and invading aliens. Here in The Village, we have one town, cutoff from the rest of society trying to battle a race of creatures who limits their abilities to even treat their sick and injured. The pace of the movie is slow and moody, especially through the orange tint and effective soundtrack. The village is lead by a counsel of elders, including Edward Walker (William Hurt) who is father to two daughters, including the blind Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Ivy has a childhood fling with the local mentally challenged man Noah (Adrian Brody) but ends up falling in love with Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), who is the first to suggest leaving the village to gain medical supplies. After Noah causes harm to Lucius, Ivy decides she's the one to go out into the woods and find medical help. This is where the movie goes from moody mythical theater to that movie with a ""twist"" ending. I wanted more, dammit. I don't think I'm the only one. I was intrigued by the creatures, and I didn't like how Shymalan dealt with them. Sure, there is a certain amount of interest and logic to how the movie played out, but it could have been more. I didn't hate this movie, but I kind of hated how it ended. Mr. Shyamalan, for your next movie, perhaps the best ""twist"" is no twist at all.",The Village

For the rest of us, it is a beautiful film. The village itself is very good too. It shows the struggle of a small town and creatures that invade it. The film has wonderful style, and costumes, and you can really get the feel of an old village with the dialog and the costumes.As for the ""plot twist"" at the end, it is just too make the film more realistic.

By this I mean it's boring in it's delivery but has an interesting overall idea. I would describe it as a slow-paced (talkative), mystery-thriller. There was 1 or 2 tense moments during the course of the film but it really doesn't get moving until the very end. This means there is ample time for you to take a few naps or go to the bathroom and stare at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself the meaning of life.So in closing, If you don't mind talk padding your mystery-thriller, then by all means check The Village out. For the rest of you, seeing this movie will probably leave you with ""mixed feelings""; an interesting idea but could have been delivered better, i.e., less talk and more creepy sh*t happening.

204,jrfranklin01,Shown To Believe,8,27 February 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan is well known for his ability to invoke suspense and surprise endings. This film keeps with his other works such as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". But much like those films, it is also designed to make you look at things a certain way. The surprise endings that are often unguessable are due to Shyamalan's cleverness in making the audience see things from a staged point of view without even realizing it. This is the very reason none of us knew Bruce Willis was a ghost in ""The Sixth Sense"". ""The Village"" can easily be summarized as a community that is haunted by some darkness in the surrounding woods. The details of such take us to a place that appears remote and colonial. All of this becomes apparent in the natives' dress and their speech. Communication and transportation are primitive and farming represents the town's livelihood. The audience at this point has a very clear sense that they are watching an older, bygone way of life.Now, about the darkness...there are creatures that lurk in the nearby woods. A relationship exists between the creatures and the townspeople, where the townsfolk stay out of the woods and the creatures leave them be. Not surprising, this ""truce"" is broken and the creatures start to pay little visits. At this point you feel like you are watching an old-world, horror-type film. Good camera work, a good cast (includes Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, and Joaquin Phoenix), and excellent suspense make this an interesting tale. Everything is amplified when one of the community members is stabbed and needs medicine. Then the story begins to involve how the community has sequestered itself from the outside world and is haunted by the forest creatures.Where things get a bit shaky is in the whole idea for the film. Please do not read on if you don't wish to know the ending. The ending reveals that the ""portrayed town"" we've been watching is actually the creation of a bunch of city goers in today's world that wanted to start their own society. While a most clever idea, retrospect shows that the way the town operated, you would think someone would have found out the truth already. And the town certainly wasn't that old, with the first generation members being William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. How did they manage to move and create a colony and then turn around and invent myths that were law? And the fact that all the town elders were cowards enough to send a blind girl to get medicine was just plain sad. Did they know that if they sent a blind girl, they would remain undiscovered? And to think the whole thing was justified by the injustices they experienced in the modern world. Kudos to William Hurt for his performance in showing how the elders were committing their own injustices. Anybody think the town held together and there'll be a Village 2? 8/10 P.S.: An excellent job is done in the woods scene with Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's daughter), where you begin to think the monsters might actually be real.",The Village
205,Barky44,Village of the Dumb,1,7 August 2004,"I never thought, in all my years, I would see a film that stirred as much loathing as my #1 Most Hated Movie of all time: Armaggedon. Yet M. Night Shaymalan has done just that with the creation of this insulting twaddle of a film.Shaymalan, who brought us genius in ""The Sixth Sense"", and suspense and tension in ""Signs"", takes a shallow run at the concept of an 18th century haunted village (done so well in films such as Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow""). Unlike Burton's film, however, Shaymalan's is boring, cliched, and unendearing, and that's only up until the big ""plot twist"" towards the end. Then the film turns downright stupid and, yes, insulting to the audience.What separates ""Village"" from other, routinely bad movies, is it is wrapped in fine cinematography, lighting, costumes, and other marks of a good film. Plus it was promoted to a certain caliber of audience, not your typical teen slasher flick. So it was supposed to be a ""quality, thought-provoking film"". Yet it is not, it borders on the ridiculous that would only be believable to those with the mind of an eight-year-old.Shaymalan must regard his audience with contempt to have created such a despicable piece of work. Well, turnabout is fair play. I will never see another one of his films again.I award this the coveted 1 out of 10 award for lame-arsed theatrical presentation of the year.",The Village

I didn't originally want to see the film, but friends are persuasive things.I like the production value of Night's films, but after all the running around and panic is done, you sit around to simply see the credits because there lies only horrible revelations that you wish you never knew.  It's like he tried to get his money's worth out of the actors he hired, so he had them thrown into additional scenes to lengthen and complicate the story, namely Adrian Brody's character around the end.I loved the score and all of the cast was right on the money with their characters, including the creepy father/village-leader with his psuedo-Amish tinged character.  But when the material to make a movie falls short, you don't stretch the story by its legs to make a good film.  You have to have that to start with, which, unfortunately, was not the case on this one.  Ask for your money back from the customer care center in your local theater after half the film is over!",The Village
207,Pavel-8,"Good Night, but not great.",7,1 August 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan has directed himself into a quandary. His first three mainstream films were all widely viewed and somewhat similar. Therefore, fair or not, he is pigeon-holed as a creator of a certain genre of film, specifically deliberately-paced, suspense-filled movies with twists in the closing moments. To his credit however, now that he has finished his first trilogy of films, he is moving on. Not out of his cinematic country, but at least into a different...er...""Village"". His latest work tells the story of a small community of people living in 1800s-era America. The villagers reside in a valley surrounded by a forest, where mysterious and dangerous creatures make their homes. The two species have reached a truce; the humans stay in the valley, and the animals remain in the woods. Violate those rules, and who knows what trouble may ensue. Once the worlds are established, certain situations potentially require help from the town beyond, which forces the humans to face their fear of the forest. Although most don't realize this, Shyamalan shied away from the surprise endings of ""The Sixth Sense"" & ""Unbreakable"" when he forged ""Signs"", choosing instead to make revelations in the closing minutes. ""The Village"" is the next progression, in which Shyamalan spreads the revelations throughout the film. A handful of such plot turns exist, some of which can be guessed, some of which can not. In the hands of a lesser director, that might be a problem. But Shyamalan is such a master at creating tension that even if you determine what is coming (as I did), he still entrances, turning your knuckles white as you cling to your seat. He does it using an entire arsenal of cinematic weapons. Editing (or lack thereof), acting, music, and most importantly in this film, framing. ""The Village"" does not feature as many single-take scenes as his prior work, which actually causes the present ones to shine all the more (one between Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Drew Howard in particular). Scenes like this give the audience a rare chances to see actors act, instead of watching numerous takes pieced together. As a solid veteran ensemble cast and with Howard an equally competent newcomer, the actors cruise through Shyamalan's Shakespeare-esque dialogue with a natural smoothness that overrides a script that could easily have felt stilted or pretentious. ""The Village"" is cut more traditionally than Shyamalan's other work, but even the typical scenes, his visual flair emerges via unique angles and camera movements, complemented by James Newton Howard's music, which takes a more active role this time, eliciting jumps and nervousness as much as emphasizing them. But the framing is where Shyamalan has kicked everything up a notch. Along with veteran cinematographer Roger Deakins (""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Shawshank Redemption""), he time and again positions vital information just off-screen, thickening the tension by hesitating to reveal for an extra beat. That technique also parallels his story-telling strategy; Shyamalan unveils the premise of the movie over two hours, keeping you edgily involved as the visual and narrative anxiety drives the film forward in his trademark deliberate manner. The high technical achievement and solid acting cover up the weak link of ""The Village"", which is the mildly compelling script. The words themselves, although old-fashioned, fully work in the colonial-esque setting. But the story simply is not as good or engaging as his prior writing. Due in part to a lack of the spiritual overtones that haunted his first three films, this one is not as intimate or personally absorbing. Also contributing to the deficiency is the larger cast. His earlier films concentrated on a handful of people; this one encompasses a wider swath of humans. Ergo, while the same (perhaps more) emotional intimacy exists, it is spread thinner, leaving the audience groping for whom to connect with. Without those themes and communion, the minimalistic acting that Shyamalan evokes from his thespians rings a tinge hollow, occasionally leaning toward vacant rather than pensive. With ""The Village"", M. Night Shyamalan falls short of the very high bar he set for himself. Of course this is comparable to the New York Yankees having a bad season because they only reached the World Series. More well done than good, it is still an above average piece of filmmaking, and like his other pictures, one that is experienced rather than simply watched.
Bottom Line: A solid effort that should be experienced, but not quite up to Shyamalan's own standards. 7 of 10.",The Village
208,film_riot,The Village,9,2 January 2008,"This is M. Night Shyamalan at the height of his game. ""The Village"" works on both important levels. Firstly, as a genre movie it is frightening. Shyamalan once again determines his reputation of being a master of suspense. But this time, unlike for example in ""Signs"", the film also works as a character drama. A very well told story hides behind all the scares. And a study about superstition, (religious) fundamentalism and courage. This was one of the worst reviewed movies in Shyamalan's career. I can't see any other reason for this than wrong expectations. I get the impression that many people disliked the movie, because they ""knew"" early that the monsters weren't real. But that's exactly my point, the film doesn't rely on the twist, because it's digging much deeper. Overall, I love the acting in this movie. But the standout in ""The Village"" has to be Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy Walker. I also love the music by John Newton Howard.",The Village
209,skymovies,"Let's have a good old chat about ""Those We Do Not Speak Of""",7,13 August 2004,"He pulls the rug from under your feet, you pull out your wallet - that's the M. Night Shyamalan way. Box office receipts prove that building a movie around a twist can work beautifully, but what's left if, like me, the viewer is wise to the scam?Nobody gave away the ending of The Sixth Sense, but I'd done the math before the movie even started - ""The kid sees dead people!"" + ""There's a great twist!"" = ""A-ha!"". I enjoyed it none the less. The Village did actually have to begin before I worked out what was going on, but where The Sixth Sense still managed to sustain an air of suspense and creepiness, this became a mere exercise in red herring-spotting.No matter how rich the photography or how many orchestrally-prompted shocks and starts he throws in, Shyamalan squanders an intriguing set-up with a ""so what?"" denouement.The cast aren't to blame: Richie Cunningham's daughter is excellent and William Hurt gets his best role in years but all the talk of ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"" and the inevitable opening of ""The Shed That Must Never Be Opened"" made me wonder when Night is gonna give us a ""Movie Not Based On A Gimmick"".",The Village
210,dhaufrect-1,Waste of Talent,2,8 August 2004,"""The Village"" is a waste of good talent.  M. Night Shyanlam has written and directed a real loser for some fairly good actors.  There are some exceptions to a scathing review.  There are moments of great photography, and there is a color quality that speaks for itself.  The eerie music is wasted on a bad film.  There is little to enjoy.  Bryce Dallas Howard remains remarkably good as the blind Ivy Walker, Hurt's daughter.  She is true to form, but another waste of a good performer.  Joaquin Phoenix also gives a good performance, but the stilted peculiar stage business is boring to say the least.  Don't waste your time or money on this cinema.  It is a mundane example of childish storytelling.",The Village
211,pontus-randen,Another different idea from Mr M. Night Shyamalan,7,30 September 2021,"He sure thinks differently, which is great. Another thing that is great is the cast, solid performers. But Bryce Dallas Howard is not just solid: She is superb!This is not a thriller, per se, but a very unusual love story. Or many love stories, really.But why Mr M. Night Shyamalan insists on showing his face in each and every movie of his is beyond me. Not that he is a bad actor but it defects the viewer from the story. One is just almost waiting for ""his scene"" and when he shows up one thinks ""there he is"". This sort of breaks you out of the movie and into reality. Which is not what you want when you watch a movie.",The Village

Night Shyamalan, you know it's going to have a couple of twists and it surely does. It's got one of the biggest twists outside of Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.This is considered by some as one of Shyamalan's flops (and there are a few) but for me this is an excellent movie.

I recommend that you go watch this film yourself.Next to the story; the acting, music, setting and effects were all very well done.

214,abooboo-2,"""The Village"" idiots",8,7 August 2004,"Contains spoiler!!! I'm not referring to the makers of the film, but to the army of critics who have made it sound like another Plan 9 From Outer Space.What is their problem? And what is motivating this inexplicable, over-the-top hostility towards M. Night Shyamalan? Uh, hello? The dude makes GOOD films. I went to see The Village this afternoon, despite all the negative buzz, bracing myself for something REALLY bad, like Bats, or The Haunting, or even Battlefield Earth. But not only is there nothing terribly wrong with the film, it is, in fact, an absorbing, suspenseful, carefully made, expertly directed Mystery/Thriller/Romance - yes, a bit self-consciously arty at times and with Shyamalan's characteristic hiccups of awkward-sounding dialogue - but a more-than-satisfactory movie-going experience and far better than the typical summer flick, with a standout performance from newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard, and able support from veterans William Hurt (who for once brings his ""A"" game) Sigourney Weaver, and Adrien Brody. It also delivers the director's trademark twist ending, one that I, for one, did NOT see coming. To all the geniuses who like to boast that they - SPOILERS! - knew all along that the story actually takes place in the present day and not in the late 1800s, I have two words for you: you're lying. Because Shyamalan presents his films partly as puzzles to be solved, a segment of the audience who fancy themselves great intellects enter the theater not in the typical relaxed movie-going mode of simply wanting to be entertained, but with arms crossed, feeling challenged to ""crack"" the film, prove they're smarter than it; in essence, wanting desperately to beat Shyamalan as if he were not a filmmaker but an opponent at Chess. Therefore, they're guarded, closed off, emotionally inaccessible and unlikely to enjoy themselves, regardless of how good the movie might be (and in fact is).The film is only a cheat from the standpoint that Shyamalan is associated with the supernatural, and when the explanation in this case is a rather prosaic one - uncomfortably close to the unmasking of the monster at the end of an episode of Scooby Doo - it is a bit of a letdown. If studies show that over half the population believes in ghosts (or aliens) then I'd estimate that the other half WANTS to believe in them. And that is why The Sixth Sense and Signs were such huge hits - in them, Shyamalan confirms those beliefs, validates them by making the supernatural world seem not ridiculous and far-fetched as most do, but tantalizingly realistic.It also doesn't help that the marketing of the film is so misleading, priming one to expect a spooky spine-tingler with chills aplenty (something like The Others) which, despite a few well-placed jolts, The Village most certainly is not. It is, of course, primarily a love story, with Shyamalan, I believe, having been inspired by Wuthering Heights. But, while the well-liked Spider-Man 2 is a love story disguised as action-adventure, it's a convincing disguise, the movie suffering from no shortage of action and excitement. The Village's disguise is not nearly so effective, its marketing the equivalent of slapping a splashy Stephen King dust jacket over a copy of The Age of Innocence. One can also question the casting of Joaquin Phoenix, a dour, somewhat charmless, far-from-handsome actor in the crucial role of Lucius, the strange, silent, sensitive young man consumed with a secret love for the free-spirited Ivy and a desire to venture into the forbidden woods. I think much of the negative reaction to the film can be explained by a subconscious desire on the part of most men and women for a more accessible, likable, and, well, better-looking actor to play that particular part. Had Orlando Bloom, for instance, been cast, I firmly believe general reaction to the film would have been much more favorable. Phoenix does finally come alive in that vividly acted porch scene where he suddenly declares his love for Ivy. And that was the scene that got me, the centerpiece of the film, where it ""clicks"" into place, reveals itself for what it is and makes no apologies for it. Lucius and Ivy belong together. You can see it in their eyes, and it is impossible for me to dislike a film that is able to capture such honesty of emotion. The essence of successful film-making is the ability to create the illusion that two people are in love. It does not happen often. So how to explain the critics' wildly inaccurate evaluation of the film, as well as their seeming hatred of Shyamalan? I can only guess that it has something to do with Shyamalan's films having a certain overly delicate ""goody-goody"" quality which makes them easy targets - I really don't know. I do know that, unlike some, I don't go into any movie determined to ""crack"" them, or even enjoy them, but I always go in determined to give them a chance.",The Village
215,dcobbimdb,"Okay movie, but the worst of his lot IMO",3,14 January 2005,"Seems like all of Shyamalan's movies tend to start off slow and build until the plot thickens as much as it can before revealing some earth shattering ending. This one was similar in many ways, the acting was good, and the cinema photography was good, the story was so so IMO. However this movie lacked something for me. Yes it was a slow developing & unwinding story (similar to his previous movies), but I guess I just failed to find enough interest in the plot and the characters as well because of that.Slight Spoilers ahead I found this movie more strange than entertaining. From the first few minutes you know something just isn't right with this town and you think you're watching some Star Trek episode about a pre warp civilization. And then comes the monster talk, the fear these villagers have of them, and the ambiance surrounding them. While it was semi intriguing, I started to loose interest when I found out certain things about the creatures and the main guy meets with an unfortunate circumstance. I didn't yet unravel the reason for much of this, but obviously I knew something was very odd. At this point I keep watching, semi interested in what's going to happen to the girl. I'm glad she killed the village idiot (too much jean mixing I guess) as he was just annoying. Then she finally reaches her destination and the whole plot twist comes spewing out like a drunk on new years eve. At this point I'm really loosing interest and saying to myself ""Um this is it???"" The fire works I was expecting had been a few sparklers instead. Snap crackle and pop and then nothing. I started off with little interest, then it built up, then just when it was supposed to keep climbing as is my previous experiences with Shyamalan's movies have been, it started dropping off. Not because I couldn't believe what was unfolding or the possibility of it, I just found it stupid and a let down. Kind of like going on a treasure hunt only to find a secret decoder ring. It was at this point where I said, ""Man I watched this thing for 90 minutes just to find out this!?!!Clearly his worst film that I have seen. Either he's running out of original stories with cool twist endings, or I missed the boat on this one. That being said I wouldn't say it was horrible, and had I only watched the first half of it I might have better things to say about it, but the ending was a big let down for me and pretty much spoiled things leaving a bad taste in my mouth. If you are fans of his other movies, give it a try (when there's nothing better to rent), you might really like it. Then again you might see it like I did.",The Village
216,w00f,Scooby Doo Meets the Fascist PTA,3,4 September 2005,"This movie probably stands out as one of the worst uses of a great cast in the recent history of film. You would think that a film containing performances by Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver  among others  would be watchable and interesting. The great cast, however, can't overcome the been-there-done-that story and the ham-fisted dialog that drags this movie straight down into a deep, dark hole.The main plot point of this film was lifted straight from an old Twilight Zone episode, and the portion containing the film's climactic tension is really nothing more than the culmination of a Scooby Doo cartoon (and he would have gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids!) I found myself waiting for the Mystery Machine to pick up the heroine, complete with Velma's trademark explanation of ""Jinkies!"" Actually, what does happen is pretty close.Question: why would a father so concerned with the protection of his blind daughter that he was attempt to start a parallel universe cut off from all contact with the outside world then allow her to go by herself into the woods? Why didn't he send help when the two cowardly teens who were supposed to protect her turned back? Very silly stuff, this.And, oh, that dialog! Did this American History professor not believe that people used contractions in the past? The whole script contains not a single one! Some of it winds up sounding like it was written by Yoda (Such a great gift, love is! *groan*) Granted, some of the cinematography is quite nice, and those in search of a period piece might enjoy this one until the near the end. Personally, it seems to me like Shyamalan had only a couple of good films in him, and is now turning out heavy-handed dreck like ""The Village"" and ""Signs."" After watching this one, I feel no particular compunction to watch any forthcoming films from him.",The Village
217,Panterken,One of Shyamalan's great 3,9,12 December 2007,"I've seen The Village three times already and I'll probably see it many times more in the future. What makes this film so strong is the incredible music, photography and the acting. As mentioned by many people before me, the young Bryce Dallas Howard is sensational. Joaquin Phoenix and William Hurt are good as always while the rest of the cast is appropriately bleach. The stars are given the room to shine and shine they do.As for the score, I think it's one of the finest ones ever to not win the Academy Award. Intense where it has to and subtle where it has to, James Newton-Howard does a tremendous job. Some of the strongest scenes however are silent ones. It's M.Night's credit that he doesn't feel forced to fill every second of the movie with music and effects. This is a mistake that is made in a great deal of movies, The Hours to name just one example.There's more than a score required to create an atmosphere. The cinematography and photography has to be top notch as well and in The Village, it is. The locations are beautiful and even though one can argue that woods already have a certain atmosphere, that it's not the Directors credit's...I believe they really made the most of the available locations. It's a fine art to do so.Now let's talk about the plot a little bit. It's a fairly simple premise but the story takes many twists and turns further on the road and in the end it satisfies. Semi-open endings are often the most powerful and intelligent ones, and I think this one is a prime example. If they would have tied all the lose ends then this movie wouldn't have been half as memorable. M.Night gets his audience thinking and leaves him feeling confused, excited, happy and sad at the same time. What more can you ask of an ending? Many people feel the Twist (even though there are actually 3 twists, there's only one with a capital T) came too early. While I can understand this impulse to think so, I feel the revelation early in the movie made the rest of the movie more interesting. The suspension wasn't gone, but merely replaced with a different kind of suspension. If the revelation would've been made in the end, like it could've been, it would have been too similar to The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable and as it is now...it's something special. Too bad not many people realize just how good this movie is. I hope it'll later be remembered as a misunderstood work of fine art, instead of a failed horror movie. It isn't a horror movie, it never tries to be, and the trailer is misleading. It's a well-made trailer, it got many people drawn to the theater, so from a business perspective it serves it's purpose. From an artistic point of view, the trailer is shamefully bad. Please don't go see the movie expecting it to be just another suspense horror movie. It's so much more.Everyone should see it at least once. You may hate it, but you should give it 1 try because you just might find yourself moved by this fine film. And that's about the highest thing that 'just a movie' can achieve.",The Village
218,jmorrison-2,"Starts out decently, then disappoints",4,25 August 2005,"An absorbing, tense, creepy drama for the most part. The earlier part of the movie does a fine job developing the various characters, and building a sense of dread and mystery about the horror surrounding the town.However, the ""twist"" is revealed much too early, and made Ivy's journey through the woods nearly meaningless. Why not wait to reveal what Ivy's father told her until later in the movie? It would have made the journey much more terrifying. It just didn't make any sense to me, and made the rest of the movie rather anticlimactic.I felt Joaquin Phoenix was a major disappointment. I get that he was the strong, silent young stud of the village, but his acting was nearly comatose. William Hurt was exceptional, as was Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrien Brody.Started out very well, and could have been a very good atmospheric thriller, but just lost it's way and fizzled out.",The Village
219,TheMovieDoctorful,My Favorite Director's Best Movie,10,2 August 2015,"I have no problem admitting that M. Night Shyamalan is my all-time favorite director. Shyamalan is such a master at crafting truly relatable and lovable characters that get you so damn invested and creating worlds both beautiful and haunting. I'll admit that ""The Last Airbender"" was one of the worst movies of all time and ""After Earth"" was outright painful to sit through, but everything else he has done has been decent at worst and perfection at best. ""The Village"" is perhaps his greatest example of true cinematic perfection. It's beautiful, emotional, intelligent, wonderfully shot, wonderfully scored, wonderfully written, wonderfully acted. In my opinion, ""The Village"" is easily one of the best movies of all time, and without a doubt one of the most criminally and tragically under-appreciated.Unfortunately, this movie is also one of the worst marketed movies of all time. In case you saw the trailers or TV spots for this film and got the wrong idea, let me give it to you straight; ""The Village"" is NOT a horror film. Hell, M. Night Shyamalan even went out of his way to CONSTANTLY tell people this film was not a horror movie despite being marketed as such everywhere. While fear is a very important theme in the movie, there are no scares to be found here. ""The Village"" is a romance story with elements of a psychological thriller, and a beautiful one at that. Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix simply ooze chemistry, and that really made me all the more invested in what were already truly well written, relatable and likable characters. Their chemistry was just PERFECT. For the sake of spoilers, I can't go TOO in depth, but about 1/2 into the movie something terrible happens to Phoenix's character Lucius Hunt, and you can just feel the horror and pain that Dallas Howard's character Ivy Walker is going through.As I may have implied, the acting across the board is outstanding. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job as Lucius Hunt, he is an extremely emotive and impulsive character and Phoenix is able to get a lot of emotional weight into his performance. The criminally underrated William Hurt does a fine turn as Ivy Walker's father Edward. Edward is a good man whose made some VERY questionable decisions for the greater good of the village, and you can really see the pain and regret on Hurt's face.Of course, the best performance in the movie is without a doubt, no question about it, Bryce Dallas Howard as the blind Ivy Walker. I love everything about her character; she's a wise teacher beyond her years, she's totally and completely selfless and empathetic, she's unbelievably proactive and brave and she has a desperate hunger for the truth as painful as it may be. Dallas Howard's performance was truly the heart and soul of the movie, she is responsible for the film's most emotional moments and is really something of a role model in how she handles some truly tragic and harrowing situations.This movie looks and sounds amazing. Everything from the sets to the lighting to the editing just carries this incredible beauty to it. It's truly a work of art. Even the musical score maintains that sense of beauty and artistry that's all over this fantastic movie. James Newton Howard's score can be calm, inviting, tense and emotional, sometimes all at once.The messages and themes of this movie, such as materialism, fear, love and even the well intentioned but flawed nature of Communism, are also explored in really deep, subtle and meaningful ways. The real antagonist in this movie is fear; Edward Hunt's fear of the corruption and possible death of his family and friends, Noah Percy's fear of losing Ivy, Lucius's fear of commitment. Fear clouds the judgment of many of the film's characters, causing them to make some really questionable decisions. But for most of the characters, it is their love that allows them to navigate their way out of the fog and mist of fear and paranoia; Ivy's love for Lucius, Edward's love for his family, e.t.c.""The Village"" is a masterpiece and a true diamond in the rough. I can't find a single thing wrong with it, and I love it more and more each time I watch it.",The Village
220,dtb,WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! Who Are THE VILLAGE's True Monsters?,7,8 October 2004,"THE VILLAGE is flawed, but better than it gets credit for. People were probably disappointed because the film was sold as a thriller when it's a mood piece about how fear and paranoia impact a community, a timely theme in our post 9/11 world. Instead of misrepresenting THE VILLAGE as a twisty shocker a la THE SIXTH SENSE, the marketing department should've tried another approach: ""M. Night Shyamalan as you've never seen him before!"" :-)Unlike MNS's previous films, it's easier to see through this story about the citizens of Covington Woods, an 1890s-style farm community, who won't venture beyond their village's borders because of their uneasy ""truce"" with the ""creatures"" outside, including jettisoning anything colored red, the ""bad color"" that purportedly attracts these creatures. The narrative transparency causes the dreamlike effect of MNS's usual leisurely pace to peter out too soon. Fortunately, the stellar cast, beautiful Pennsylvania scenery, and eerie atmosphere held my attention. Former co-stars William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver reunite as village elders Edward Walker and Alice Hunt; for once Hurt's slightly dazed soft-spokenness suits his character! :-) Joaquin Phoenix, re-teaming with his SIGNS director, radiates quiet strength and intensity as Lucius Hunt, who tries to cross the village borders into ""the towns"" for medicine to combat the community's recent rash of illnesses and deaths. Phoenix is well-matched by Bryce Dallas Howard, lovely and endearing in her film debut as Walker's blind daughter Ivy. I liked Ivy's subtle boldness as she saves the day after the guys who accompany her to the village borders chicken out. No surprise that Adrien Brody signed on for the role of mentally-challenged Noah Percy (or as his character has been dubbed by smart-alecks, ""the VILLAGE idiot"") as his first post-Oscar role. It gave him an opportunity to work with a hot director (turning MNS down at this point in his career would've been like turning down Alfred Hitchcock in the 1940s and '50s), and most actors can't resist playing handicapped characters. Brody did a fine job with a role more complex than it first seems. In Brody's able hands, overgrown child Noah simultaneously breaks your heart, makes you laugh, and creeps you out. His behavior reminded me of autistic/ADHD children I've known, so I was particularly moved when Lucius wonders if ""the towns"" might have medicines to help Noah ""sit still and learn."" (Seeing Brody in 1890s-style clothing got me thinking how great he'd be as Ichabod Crane if somebody films ...SLEEPY HOLLOW again!) The finest moment in Brody's performance comes after Lucius and Ivy's engagement is announced. Up until this point, Lucius, Ivy, and Noah have been a trio, with Noah responding affectionately to Ivy's kindness. That changes forever after the engagement, when Noah turns up on Lucius' doorstep with grief in his heart, tears in his eyes -- and a knife in his hand. After the attack, Noah's parents find him rocking agitatedly on the porch, frightened of ""the bad color"" on his bloodstained hands. When Ivy finds out, she confronts Noah, who holds his arms out to her, clearly sorry and hoping for forgiveness, only to have Ivy start shrieking and hitting him until she's dragged off him. Although what Noah did was horribly, unforgivably wrong, his howls of anguish and wrenching sobs almost brought me to tears. (I'd love to see Brody's and Howard's performances get award nominations!) When Lucius' wounds become infected, Ivy must trek to ""the towns"" to get medicine. Here's where the twist (and the *SPOILER*) comes in: Walker gives his daughter what turns out to be a prescription, and the foreshadowing (particularly various Villagers' revelations of losing loved ones violently in ""the towns"" in their pre-Village lives) pays off. Our villagers *don't* live in the 1890s. The time is now...the village is a sanctuary from today's world, created by the town elders to raise their children away from the tragedy and heartbreak of their former modern city lives...the creatures were fabricated to keep the young people in line and in the dark, with various townspeople -- including Noah in mischievous-child mode -- donning creature costumes and skinning small animals periodically to scare everybody. And Walker masterminded it all! A history teacher from a powerful family, Walker used his inherited wealth to establish this quasi-Brigadoon in an isolated area of the Walker family's game preserve, with the adults conspiring to keep the village going with various deceptions. I liked the idea that Walker's rich enough to pull this off, with the preserve personnel on board with the ruse (when the young ranger Ivy meets outside the game preserve realizes she's a Walker, he quickly agrees to help her); I'm all for the idea of living in one's own little homemade world! :-) But why the hell would supposedly intelligent modern people like Walker & Company set their new community in an ersatz 1890s (even the gravestones list 1890s dates!), a time without *antibiotics?!* The film begins at the funeral of a little boy who, it's made clear, is one of several children who died of illnesses that could've been cured with the right medicine. I can't believe Walker and the town doctor didn't take precautions to have modern meds available just in case, to say nothing of medicine/treatments that might have helped poor mentally-stunted Noah and maybe even Ivy's blindness! It's unconscionable that, however well-meant Walker's power trip is, he and the others would let their children die or be damaged for life rather than go into ""the towns"" for help, even if it means their elaborate ruse might collapse around them! (Amish people come to cities for supplies or trade in real life, so why couldn't Walker and the villagers do the same?) THE VILLAGE would've been more compelling had the script delved deeper into that aspect of it, with the secrets, lies, and power the elders have, but at such a terrible cost. Then MNS might have had a future classic on his hands, not just the cinematic equivalent of a nice try.",The Village
221,neenahhh,"Creepy, but not so much",7,3 February 2011,"Before actually watching this movie, I did some research. I saw tons of people complaining about the twist ending, so I was wondering what in the world happened that made people hate it so much. The hate made me even more curious to actually watch the film, so I did!I can say that I found this movie to be quite good, but then again, I don't think it's for everyone. If you enjoy thrillers that sort of play with your mind a little, then you should give this a try. Don't be swayed by the negative comments!All the actors in this film were perfect. Their performance was simply splendid. Every last one of them. Especially ""Ivy"". Bryce Dallas Howard was brilliant! Her acting was amazing. Words cannot describe how good she was. But seriously, she was great.(SPOILERS) I found the idea of the ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" to be great. It creeped me out, though. I had to lower the volume every time the scenes seemed to turn scary. But it was good. I never would have thought that they were just the Elders. I think it would have been better if there were really creatures like them. The whole idea of them, made up the creepy factor for me. Until now, I keep on glancing towards the door, half fearing that one of them will show up.I loved the relationships between people. All the characters had their own little quirks. Ivy's blind. I liked the parts where she was talking about people's colors. It reminded me of synesthesia, which I find very interesting and hope to learn more about it. Lucius is a very quiet and reserved man. But he does have feelings. He tries to keep it bottled up inside, but it gets out eventually. I never would have expected that he would stop being the main character halfway throughout the film. I mean, who kills off the main character? Unexpected twist, but very welcome. It reminded me of Death Note where that antagonist dies. Noah, a grown man who has some sort of developmental problem, likes Ivy. When he finds out Lucius and Ivy are getting married, he gets crazy. I was not expecting that at all. And the Elders? Well, they have their own messed up story. To sum it up, everyone's got their own little thing going on. It was what made this movie what it was. Great character development! Even the minor characters were great! I loved the ranger guy. His kindness and compassion- trying to help Ivy, even if meant losing his job.. Great. Gives me hope for the world. (/SPOILERS)This movie gave me a Shutter Island feel. It's like, you think you know something, but you really don't. The ending was just like Shutter Island's also. An open ending. You ask what happened? Well, it's up to your imagination, my dear. To sum it up, it was a great movie! M. Night Shyamalan needs to make more movies like this.",The Village
222,scobbah,Surprisingly good,8,25 August 2004,"I just got home from the premiere of ""The Village"" - and guess if I got surprised! I've read and heard people talking bad about this piece, but oh no, this one is surely splendid! You just have to experience it at the cinema! It's a very good story and original as well, combined with some good acting from actors we often see having small roles in other movies, except for the one playing Noah (who's really impressive in ""The Pianist""). All is good, really. I'm into horrors and I usually never get scared, but this one made me jump in the chair a few times at the cinema. Gosh, it's great! Go and see it and judge by yourself - the ratings are poor guidance! :)",The Village
223,Zombified_660,Chilling? No. Moving? Yes.,7,7 April 2006,"The Village was a strange experience for me. I came out of it having genuinely enjoyed the film, but a little part of me wanted to slap M. Night Shyamalan for changing gears so often in the movie. The nightmare with reviewing this movie is that if I reveal why it's a bittersweet victory of a film, I'll ruin the last act and negate anybody's reason for watching the film.So instead, I'll concentrate on why it's good. Most of it's charm comes from the sheer visual richness of the movie, and the rest comes from the central performances of William Hurt, Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquim Phoenix. All of them hand in warm, emotive turns that elevate the movie.The story is quite moving too. It's part human drama, part Twilight Zone episode, and it works very well. I thought it was much more moving than it was scary, in fact, certain things occur in the movie that present a large obstacle to it continuing to be as creepy as it starts out, and it's this moving nature that made me enjoy it. It has some lovely, wonderful scenes, especially a quiet, restrained and beautiful scene between Phoenix and Howard.Still, while I recommend The Village, it has it's flaws. There's a slight awkwardness to the script that makes it seem that it's trying too hard, and some of the last act twists are both frustrating and make it really hard to emphasize with some characters in hindsight. Despite this, it's an emotional and heart-warming couple of hours, twists or no twists, thanks largely to Howard and Hurt's barnstorming central performances.",The Village
224,alexduffy2000,"See Not This Movie, Burn This Village",1,2 August 2004,"""The Village"" is just awful.  I feel like I was suckered into giving up $20 by Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan himself, and that he should personally apologize to my wife and I for tricking us into watching this awful film. Since that's not going to happen, first I will rant, and then go into some well-marked spoilers.
*RANT*This film promises one thing and delivers something completely different.  I was fooled by the advertising campaign, I thought this was a HORROR film, not a nearly two-hour long episode of the Twilight Zone (and not a very good one either).Ron's Howard's daughter's acting really sucks!  She's the ""blind girl,"" but until she tells the audience she's blind, you'd never know it.  She looks right at people, runs through fields without tripping, etc.  Her emotional range is so limited that I thought she was autistic as well (but that's just bad acting).All I can say is DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE.  It is a waste of time and money, and most likely, you'll feel ripped-off.  Buy not the ticket, it will show you the bad movie.
***SPOILERS AHEAD*** ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** ***SPOILERS AHEAD***Warning:  Don't read what follows unless you've seen the movie or don't care if certain scenes are spoiled for you.The premise of this film is that in the 1970's a professor and some other folks are part of some ""recovery group"" for people who have lost loved ones to violent crime.  So he gets a forest preserve (somehow), prevents planes from flying over it (somehow).  In the center is The Village built on a glen and fields, and surrounding the fields is a forest, and surrounding the forest is a tall wooden fence, which is patrolled by guards in jeeps.  Who pays for all this?  Who cares.The professor sets up this village so the people of the recovery group can live in ""innocence"".  Supposedly there will be no crime or violence. However, he and the ""elders"", the original members of the recovery group, decide that the best way to keep the generation of kids that will be born in the village away from the outside world is to fill the woods with ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"", essentially were-porcupines who wear red robes.  The were-porcupines are actually the elders, taking turns being ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"".  25 years or something goes by from when they set up this Village, so now, in 2004, The Village is filled with a new generation that knows nothing of the outside world.Now, I paid money to watch a HORROR movie.  I was very curious as to what the creatures in the woods were.  I was hoping the villagers would get tired of being bullied by these creatures, and would rise up against them, but they would be going up against tough supernatural creatures, so the battle would be long, exciting, tense... we'd learn more about these creatures, their origins, religion, society, etc.  But I wanted above all to see a SUPERNATURAL THRILLER, what I felt the trailer promised.  Instead it was an episode of the Twilight Zone.  You can almost hear Rod Serling:  ""For man has only one real enemy to fear.  It is man himself.""  Aw geez, gimme a break!Manoj Nelliyattu Shyamalan's script is just bad.  The film begins with scenes from The Village, where everyone is talking in this fake sounding 1890's American English.  No one, and I mean NO ONE ever spoke American English this way.  If this is supposed to be particular to The Village, then okay, but if this is supposed to be reflective of 1890's speech, give me a break.  Shymanlan should have read ""McTeague"" or another famous novel from the 1890's to get some kind of flavor of how people spoke in those days.Adrian Brody is just WASTED here as the village idiot.  This is the guy who one the Best Actor award for ""The Pianist"", remember?  He could have been working on a real project instead of this tripe.  And if he is the village idiot, how does he know how to find his parents' were-porcupine costume, put it on, escape from a locked room, and find the EXACT location of Ron Howard's daughter in the woods?  Did he have GPS?Eventually, The Village would rebel against the creatures, regardless of hurt.  They are just a bunch of were-porcupines, there's no way they could stand up against an entire Village determined to kill these vermin once and for all!Why aren't the kids in The Village more curious about the creatures?  How come none of them have ever stumbled upon their parents dressing up in a were-porcupine suit?  Isn't it odd to the kids that on some nights their parents disappear, then appear tired in the morning?Also, there's no way the fake ""joy"" in The Village could be sustained over a course of years.  The kids, especially the teenagers, would get bored and rebellious.  Even some of the adults would want out, and once on the outside, they'd open their big fat mouth and tell the world about this Village.Boring, unconvincing, just plain bad.  Steer clear of this Village.",The Village
225,gcrokus,"""The Island"" Meets Scooby-Doo Meets Stephen King",5,31 January 2005,"As atmospheric thrillers go, M. Night Shyamalan's ""TheVillage"" is decidedly of the ho-hum variety. In fact, it actually is one of the more annoying films  among those that have a certain pedigree, some hint of promise  of 2004.Set in 1897 Pennsylvania, we are transported to a time and place of such improbable existence that we are forthwith un-amused by the setting. We learn that the community is isolated to a degree particularly unfathomable as close to the turn of the century as is depicted. The East had been long crisscrossed with roads and commerce; no community in Pennsylvania (perhaps in other parts of Appalachia this may have been the case) was so remote. But for the sake of the film, let's consider that they are that isolated.What comes to pass is that the town-folk have established a sort of truce with the horrifically-depicted denizens of the surrounding forest. A veritable wall has been built to demarcate the limits of the community; anything outside the line is certainly out-of-bounds. And the Elders have certainly taken great pains to point out that, basically, this is our turf and that is theirs, and as long as we respect that we are alright.And right here we have to say the most engaging character of the entire film is William Hurt (as Edward Walker, it seems the Senior Elder). He really does capture a soft-spoken self, offers some calm in the storm that the village confronts and seems the only logical one through all the film. What message might be gleaned is channeled through Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy Walker).The movie really is about those inside confronting the outside world. A swirl of events necessitates this. Rated an incredibly generous 6.5/10 on IMDb and a more appropriate 44% on the Tomatometer, M. Night Shyamalan himself notes in an interview (http://www.cinemaconfidential.com/news.php?id=0407301) that ""I wanted to write a romance, a period romance. I wanted to go back to the1890s where people believed in love. It was hard to write because I had to remove all my sarcasm out of my writing. Today when we say things sarcasm is always there. In that era, when someone said, ""I like you"" it meant they liked you."" And therein lies the problem with ""The Village""  the writer has fallen for the always popular but wrong-headed notion that things were better in the old days. Hokum.But you would have to watch it for yourself to determine if any of this is plausible; this is not really a film that had to be made. ""The Village"" is sort of Benchley's 1980 ""The Island"" meets Scooby-Doo meets Stephen King. And if any of that attracts your attention, this is the film for you.Rating: Two Stars.",The Village
226,Fever,weird...but very good,8,16 January 2005,"There were such bad reviews of this movie, I had to see it. I've been a huge fan his work. This movie is very typical of his design--unexplained scenes, foreshadowing and the ending that doesn't really end. You'll notice as you watch this that some things just don't make sense but he does explain them all and the plot twist is a jaw dropper. The ending is also much like ""Signs"". It doesn't really end-- there's no last battle where the villain is defeated. The true nature of the story is revealed and the characters go on about their lives. I think that's why people were so disappointed. I do have to say I didn't like Sigourney Weaver in this. She's an excellent actress, but she just didn't fit the character. Phoenix was great as always.If you love ""Signs"" or ""The Sixth Sense"", you'll love this. The story is a little slow, but don't worry, everything is explained and though Phoenix's ""color"" is never revealed, get ready for a few jump-out-of-your-seat scenes.",The Village
227,themarina1,Another great movie from a master of suspense,8,3 August 2004,"Truth be told, I've been a fan of Shyamalan since I first saw the '6th Sense'. I was hoping against all odds that this guy would have more than one good movie to give us and boy, has he ever. With every new story, Shyamalan roots himself in the psyche as a master of suspense. His films are scary in the the same way that the ""Blair Witch Project"" was scary - by not showing us what we want to see. Joaquin Phoenix is always excellent and this movie was no exception. The rest of the all star cast including Hurt and Weaver provided some great performances but the show taker was Bryce Howard, a relative new comer from a line of Hollywood royalty. This is a fabulous film with a great story line that keeps you on your toes. I only wish Shyamalan had waited a little closer to the ending to show us the movie's hidden secret.8/10 A great excuse for curling up to that special someone",The Village
228,samhill5215,competent but incredible,6,29 September 2007,"First the good: technically, The Village is a visually engrossing, well-crafted and photographed film. The cast is more than up to the task, especially Bryce Dallas Howard who is absolutely engrossing. The basic concept, the pact with the creatures inhabiting the forest that allows the villagers their idyllic existence, is believable if one leans toward the supernatural or at least for its entertainment value. The story moves along with plenty of drama until the moment when everything is revealed and then it all falls apart. Of course there are hints that all is not as it seems, that this is not really a pre-industrial age era. The women's liberated behavior is proof enough that we're dealing with enlightened people here. The problem as I see it is that customary human emotions and faults are not accounted for. How is it that for all these years the leaders (the elders as they're called) of this community have shown no jealousy, competition or envy toward each other. How is it there have been no defections? How did they manage to keep their secret this long? Call me a pessimist, but people are guided as much by these emotions as by the cooperation, goodwill and love the villagers exhibit.By placing the plot in the present all of these issues come into play and must be dealt with. The fact they were not left me incredulous. It would have been better if the villagers were survivors of an apocalyptic war and the woods were inhabited by mutants. Or if the villagers were actually colonists on an earth-like planet surrounded by aliens in the forest. These scenarios would preserve the fantasy instead of stretching our credulity by expecting us to believe all the villagers (with the exception of Brody's character) were altruists.",The Village
229,japamo,"The Ultimate ""C'mon"" movie (Spoilers Below)",3,27 August 2004,"To be uncharacteristically succinct, I think ""The Village"" was an inept melange of ""The Truman Show"", ""The Twilight Zone"", ""The Prisoner"", and ""Scooby Doo"" (the elders would have gotten away with it too, were it not for the meddling kids Lucius and Ivy). Admittedly, its themes of secure utopia (and the lengths people will reach to preserve it) and the ""woods as labyrinthine hell"" metaphor were intriguing and thought-provoking, but I felt M. Night Shyalaman's framework for presenting these themes was too contrived, attenuated,inept and inconsistent to be effective. As a 30-minute ""Twilight Zone"" episode, the premise would have had more shocking impact. As a feature-length movie, it appeared amateurish and pretentious instead, with too many plot and logic holes. Perhaps Mr. Shyalaman should have presented his themes in a straightforward way, without ""the past is really the present"" or ""it was Earth all along - god damn you all to hell"" twist, and really achieved the ultimate twist of having no twist.One can forgive a movie's lapses in logic if they are infrequent and the movie is basically intelligent and entertaining, but I felt ""The Village"" is truly neither. The dialogue is self-consciously excruciatingly pompous, the characters' actions stupefying (i.e. Lucius has been stabbed twice in the abdomen; his life is dribbling away, will SOMEBODY get the medicine already? and ""Ivy, get down in the cellar already?""), the ""monsters"" shoddily anthropomorphic and the ending inert. I did like the atmosphere and cinematography, however, but small compensation for this ""house of cards"" movie. To play devil's advocate for a moment, perhaps Mr. Shyalaman deliberately made his movie imperfect to inspire thoughtful commentary and discussion (is THIS the ultimate twist?)Now I present a list of plot/logic lapses designed to prompt ""C'mon"" responses:1. Could even a billionaire arrange to prevent airplanes from flying over the woodlands preserve?2. Those poles the villagers were painting the mollifying color yellow sure looked like telephone poles.3. Would you put a monster suit in a cellar where the village idiot would have ready access to it?4. Would any rational, humane person send a blind girl (no matter how stereotypically pure and resourceful, since of course blind people are always above reproach, unflinchingly brave, and possess extrasensory perception - is she Daredevil's daughter?) alone into the woods for medicine? That is cruel and unusual punishment violating the 8th amendment!5. To protect the ""idyllic"", ""pristine"" village from the encroachment of evil civilization, wouldn't you need an army of security personnel? Only one appears in the movie and, even though he's apparently a novice, he seemed inert.6. Cut off from the outside world, how can the village sustain itself for any period of time? Wouldn't the inhabitants go mad being restricted to the village limits? Curiosity will ultimately surmount fear.7. As my friend Joe Flynn, who watched the movie with me, said, ""Wouldn't some stoned teenagers trespass into the woodland preserve and stumble upon the village?"" Exactly.If I had to rate this movie, I would give it a 3/10. Still, in its maladroit way, ""The Village"" stimulates thought, which is more than you can say for many movies that are otherwise more efficient and entertaining!",The Village
230,Caps Fan,Satisfactory,7,5 August 2005,"Maybe I've seen too many movies like this. I'd worked out what the catch would be very early on and watching the rest of the movie was simply a case of proving I was right and adding some details.That said, the movie works rather well. Though nothing very much actually happens (until the last 20 minutes or so), the film sustains a pleasurably uncomfortable level of tension for most of its length. In this, it is helped by a splendid performance from Bryce Dallas Howard. The supporting cast, containing such worthies as Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt, is also excellent. Only Joaquin Phoenix seems strangely disengaged; however, his character barely appears in the last portion of the film, so this doesn't spoil things too much.The photography was OK and I enjoyed listening to the dialog, framed as it was in the English of the late 19th century. The music, however, was sometimes intrusive; there are times in all movies when music just isn't necessary, a fact the film makers here seemed not to realize.One to watch nonetheless. Something of a leap of faith is required, but it's worth the trouble.Rating: 7/10.",The Village
231,Adorable,Mysteries as They Should Be,8,12 September 2004,"A panoply of eccentric characters. A nexus of befuddling events. A 19 th Century hamlet living on borrowed time, encased in fragile borders courting disaster at every turn. A perfect vehicle for the infamous Shyamalan bandwagon to re-roll itself back into the limelight, with the fabled writer-producer-director's possibly best-accomplished project yet.The Village takes place in a cordoned-off community deep in the woods somewhere, and defies spoilage-free critique. Its residents face a seldom spoken-of enemy fielding indefinable properties, and emanating from the bleak foliage all around them. While within the fortified village a lively decorum takes precedence over inevitable desperation, brewing sentiments hint at a boiling point just as compellingly unavoidable as the horrors lurking all around.Reminiscent of The Blair Witch, Sleepy Hollow and The 13th Warrior in a few important, albeit not critical ways, The Village dishes out superb suspense with a colossal twist in its prickly tail. Devoid of redundancies such as computer graphics, Shyamalan's latest relies on red herrings and subtle innuendo rather than cleverer-than-thou hints and foreshadows, allowing its ample cast freedom of performance within certain limits. A few, like Sigourney Weaver and Brendan Gleeson, do ably enough but leave little to write about. Others thrive on the story, like excellent Joaquin Phoenix as suspecting introvert Lucius Hunt, William Hurt as Village elder and mentor Edward Walker, and Adrien Brody as the bumbling local idiot.Stemming from its sadly short runtime, The Village hardly ever lingers, pausing briefly to touch upon loving exchanges between Lucius and intelligent observer Ivy Walker, done by Bryce Dallas Howard, Ron Howard's daughter. Instead of spreading itself too thin, the movie brilliantly stays close to its core attraction, all the time teasing audiences with near-revelations and stretching everything till the very last minute, when the oddball conclusion become unavoidable.There may be those decrying The Village's dearth of bombastic screen writing idealization and low-end production values (where they managed to bury $60 million remains to be found), but as a spooky creepy crawler big on brains it operates smoothly and with no major glitches at all. Make no mistake, while not strictly horror, The Village delivers tensions stressful enough to register with viewers like a spindly, electric headache coming out of nowhere, and its uniquely bewildering intimidation guarantees it an honorary perch among recent cinematic mind-benders.Rating: * * * *",The Village

233,jcanettis,Thought - Provoking,9,13 February 2005,"The ""Village"" is a highly interesting and thought-provoking film. Well-directed by M.N. Shyamalan, the story unfolds in what seems a common 19th century small village in the middle of a forest. This village however is different: As we learn early in the film, it is surrounded by mysterious creatures (having the apt moniker ""Those We Don't Speak Of""), who terrorize the villagers; the latter have come up with some sort of a pact with ""Those We Don't Speak Of"", so that neither crosses each other's borders. In effect, the villagers are hence incarcerated, and we watch their strange life as they are cut out from the outer world.The movie studies mainly three main characters: Luscious Hunt, played well by Phoenix, a boy who talks little but is gentle and noble in his acts. Ivy Walker, a role which Bryce Howard does a great job in portraying, is a blind girl who is in love with Luscious, and displays a great deal of courage despite her disability. Finally, Noah Percy is a mentally retarded boy, who plays a key role in the sequence of events; Brody performs a very good act here.*** SPOILERS ***What raises the heat in the film, is the following: When Noah attacks and seriously injures Luscious due to his jealousy for Ivy's heart, the shattered girl asks for permission to go to the nearest town to get medicines and save her lover's life. Although her request should normally be denied, as it will violate the pact with the creatures, her father gives in, and without informing the other ruling ""Elders"", he tells her the Village's great secret: Namely, that in fact everything (the Village, the creatures, and the whole setting) have simply been fabricated by him and his fellow ""Elders"", as a way to escape the 21st century civilization.The reason is that all of them have suffered from crime and violence in the normal world, and so they created this habitat in the middle of a wildlife preservation (owned or sponsored by Ivy's father), so as to create a totally new society. They then invented the scary story about ""Those We Don't Speak Of"", so that their children would be permanently banned from being inoculated with the ""ills"" of the outer world. Ivy finally goes outside, although she is both blind and totally unprepared for the environment of 21st century life; she is simply lucky to find a guard who sympathizes with her, offers her the medicines, and helps her to get back. In her heroic journey, she gets attacked by Noah dressed in a creature suit, but manages to kill him. The film ends with Ivy giving the medicines to her lover, while the ""Elders"" consider Noah's death (whom everyone bar them believes it was a wild creature), as the fact that will now make their story fully bullet-proof, and therefore their ""Village"" will be able to incarcerate its villagers indefinitely.I have found the movie incredibly thought-provoking. It is interesting how these people decided to fight society's ills (from which all have suffered, by losing friends and relatives from crime), by creating an even bigger one: They took the fatal decision of creating this isolated Village-Prison, in which they watched their children suffer and die from illnesses and disabilities, while they were unwilling to provide them any professional help or treatment from the outer world just because they wanted to preserve their fabrication. Moreover, they preferred to have everyone live in a big lie, rather than go to the real world (no matter how difficult that would be) and face it. They stuck to this until the very end, determined to pursue the wicked goal at any cost.A story that makes you pause and think. 9/10.",The Village
234,stevetseitz,Spoilers! A riddle wrapped up in an enigma wrapped in an O.K. movie,7,4 August 2004,"The current mind-blower of American cinema is at it again. M. Night Shyamalan has carefully crafted another interesting exercise for the viewer.
I say exercise because this film lacks the heart present in Shyamalan's earlier works ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"". I might as well get the spoiling out of the way now because in order to move on to the themes of the film it is required. The story of the film is a sham within a sham. The residents of a 19th century ""village"" are actually hostages of a group of crazed or fanatical neo-puritans who call themselves the ""elders"". These elders keep control over their totalitarian mini society through the use of clever manipulation and propaganda techniques. They have convinced all the other residents of the town that to leave the borders of the town is certain death at the hands of some mythical or supernatural creatures. They even portray these creatures using elaborate costumes in order to frighten the younger residents into submission. Their goal is to isolate and control the environment in order to separate the residents from what they see as a evil modern world. The next level of sham is that this ""19th century"" town isn't simply isolated from their industrial revolution age peers. They are actually a living, breathing human time-capsule existing within a huge nature preserve in the present day. The preserve was set up by the billionaire relative of William Hurt's character, who is a university professor.  The whole thing started when a grieving Hurt comes up with the bright idea that the elders, all members of a ""relatives of victims of violence"" support group should start their sham society. I know, I know...it sounds contrived and it is. But the method to this madness is effective and eerie. I enjoyed the superb cinematography and good performances by Brodie, Phoenix, Weaver and Hurt. The dialogue must have been a chore to deliver and they do a passable job of keeping straight, even earnest expressions on their faces.
I'll pretty much see anything M. Night makes because it is never boring. I much prefer ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", and ""Signs"" to this film. The end is either reassuring or horrible depending on whether you like faux-19th century totalitarian brainwashing or not.",The Village
235,GreyHunter,I remember when it came out...,8,20 September 2020,"Carefully avoiding spoilers...At the time the movie came out, there was a huge fuss about Shyamalan pigeonholing himself as a ""twist ending schtick"" movie-maker, with this movie being considered unfavorably compared to ""The Sixth Sense."" I watched it in the theater and while I wasn't extremely impressed (though I was a bit drunk, so take that as you will) I didn't think the criticism was fair. I hadn't really thought about it in the decade and a half since, and barely even remembered much of it. So I decided on a rewatch recently and came to the conclusion that I agreed with my original assessment, and actually found it more impressive to boot.The ""twist"" is a twist, no question. Shyamalan likely was trying to accede to expectations by continuing to give twist endings to his movies. But this movie is actually a fairly solid story even outside of the twist. In ""The Sixth Sense,"" the twist made the movie, or at least elevated it from good to great. Here, the twist is less an attempt at a shock ending than a natural progression of the plot and a thematic element to accentuate the story of the village and how the people came to reside there. Obviously the twist adds to the movie, but as a plot point rather than a surprise ending. This is most obvious in the fact that the reveal was basically done 30 minutes before the end of the movie, at which point we were less shocked than enlightened with regards to the nature of the events earlier in the movie.All in all, a solid mystery/drama movie. I'm glad I decided to rewatch it.",The Village

239,JimD73,Don't Avoid the Village Because You Think It Might Scare You. Avoid Because it Sucks.,2,3 February 2005,"The Sixth Sense was good. Unbreakable was OK. Signs was OK. The Village, well, it looked bad. I'm sorry, but Shymalamadingdong was not making a great impression with this one. I did want to see it, if just to say I saw it. So is the Village worth anything at all? Plot: 5/25: Basically, we have a village (shocking, huh). It is apparently the 1800s or so. This village is residence to a very small number of people. There is a group of elders, who have meetings only they are privy to. Oh, and the forests around the village are off-limits because they are surrounded by monsters, called 'Those We Do Not Speak Of', which is an oxymoron in itself (apparently, Shyamalamadingdong was too lazy to name them). Anyway, the villagers and the creatures made a truce. The villagers stay out of the forest, the creatures stay out of the village. This means that the villagers are isolated from the outside world. So when a child dies due to illness, Lucius Hunt (Phoenix) asks to go to the town across the forest to retrieve medicine for future purposes. He, of course, gets a no, but curiosity gets the best of him and he takes a few steps past the boundary before getting scared off by a noise. That night, the creatures visit and leave warnings. Stay out.There is also a love plot that involves Lucius and the blind Ivy Walker (Howard), daughter of the leader of the elders Edward Walker (Hurt). Lucius has a love for Ivy, and they get engaged once he saves her from the creatures. But this gets Ivy's friend Noah Percy (Brody) jealous, and Noah is, well, retarded.Of course, there is the Shyamalanic twist, but unlike that in The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, this one is painfully obvious. There are actually two, one I knew right away and another that is just fill in the blanks work after all the holes you poke through it earlier. The twists are disappointing, to say the least. The actual plot is actually pretty dumb once you sit through it once. It is fairly original, I'll give it that, but nothing more.Horror: 6/25: To say this movie provided no thrills isn't true. It provides a couple. Mostly cheap ones at that. Shyamalan is a master at the type of camera tricks that make something scary, and this is no exception. It just never seems really horrifying. It's not a scary concept, but some cheap camera tricks make it a little scarier than it should be. Without Shyamalan behind the camera, this wouldn't be scary, it'd just be dumb.Acting: 8/25: The acting here is much like other movies when I say they took some good talent and ruined it with one of the worst scripts I have ever seen. Everyone talks like they're in the company of the Queen of England, so we get long, drawn out sentence and words that haven't been casually used since Shakespeare was shat out of his mother's womb. This pretty much ruins Phoenix and Weaver here. They are both good actors, but the script hurts them. Adrien Brody, despite an Oscar under his belt, is not right for this role. William Hurt gets his share of crappy lines, but he makes the best of it and isn't half bad. Bryce Dallas Howard, despite this being her first real role, is the only one here who is impressive in the least. If this is what she can do with a bad script Entertainment: 0/25: This is one of those movies that feels like it never ends despite being only a bit over 1 ½ hours. The whole dialogue problem really makes this much worse than it should have been. I really couldn't wait for this to be over.Total: 19%: Shyamalamadingdong made a poopie. That's basically the best way to put it. The Village is boring, stupid movie that really is guaranteed to disappoint anyone who even remotely liked the other three. Enough said.",The Village
240,chas437,'The Village' Doesn't Fit Neatly in a Box...,10,18 December 2019,"Therefore, all the hatred and horrible reviews ensue. Roger Ebert gave this film 1 star. Unbelievable. He either had a petty gripe with the filmmaker, or this film went right over his head. The former I suspect. If you've read Ebert's reviews over the years, you will see he misses the boat on many great films. This is one.This is a film that defies genre. That apparently is too much to handle for a great many film goers. It also comes with a profound twist. This film is best appreciated if one doesn't know about this on initial viewing. Many people who knew about the twist ahead of time trashed the film. Many others were expecting a gruesome horror film.'The Village' is loaded with profound thematic material. In the character of Noah, we see the origins of evil. Petty human jealousy leads to a 'crime' as Walker puts it. This is what the founders of the Village came to escape.We also see the creation of a mythology in Ivy's journey. Every budding civilization required its own mythology. The story of Ivy and Lucius underscores and edifies the vision of the founders.Its not a perfect film, but I found it to be so fascinating, I re-watch it every year or so. The music is beautiful and the performers are outstanding. Sadly, The Village sails right over so many people's heads.",The Village
241,JeanMoniette,3 points for the cinematrography,3,16 July 2020,"Saved from the bin because of it's excellent cinematography. There are some really great shots in there, and people who appreciate camera work will love it for that.If on the other hand you're here to enjoy a movie, it's essentially 1h45 of filler with a twist at the end because of who the director is. It's very meta in a way - you go see his films because you want to 'guess the twist' before your friends do. But this does not a movie make, especially as since everyone is looking for the twist, it had to be hidden from view the whole time , and that - is a big 'script twist' no-no.3 points for the DP and camera crew.",The Village
242,bbbl67,"Seems bad at first, until you think a little about it",7,12 August 2004,"I waited a couple of days before writing this review. I'm glad I did, because it doesn't seem as bad upon sober second thought as it did after first seeing it. I was even contemplating revealing the surprise ending, so that others didn't have to bother watching this film. But I won't give it completely away.Yes, there is a twist at the end, although the twist pretty much gets revealed about 30-45 minutes from the end. The twist gets fleshed out in more detail from the first revelation to the final ending, and you are even wondering part way through if the twist is the real twist or if there is something even more twisted underneath. I'll let you know your first impression of this twist might be that it is a bit of a letdown.
But prior to the revelation of the twist, we have about another hour of character development. It's filled with very idyllic scenes of 19th century American village life. Simple people going about their simple lives. Communal dinners in the outdoors. People socializing with each other. It's almost like watching a documentary -- with scary music that is. I sometimes wonder if Shyamalan isn't really more cut out to do documentaries on simple people; most of his movies have had some scenes of simple peacefulness -- even The Sixth Sense. Really good scenes, and I dare say only Shyamalan could get away with putting such slow-moving scenes into a movie -- because you know that there is going to be a twist at the end which will put this idyllic life into perspective. All I can suggest to you is don't be too disappointed by the ending, it's not as bad as it first seems.",The Village
243,cinish,Sensitive study on an urban legend,8,21 September 2020,"Quite a few noble characters through the movie. The main male protagonist and the female protagonist are both noble and on courageous heroic journeys that you as a viewer back emotionally, and want to see them succeed.The movie is a rational expose on the super natural subject of the movie. Sensitively and respectfully justifying the legend but at the same time baring the truth.The movie has good control. Quite a lot is conveyed with a slow deliberate pace.
It is interesting how the movie breaks the myth that it is based on and yet does not fall into pieces.There is a genuineness and honesty in these characters. And this quality extends into the relationships between the characters as well. It is a movie with a lot of character and dimensions and not a shallow horror flick.",The Village

245,fastmike,Unspeakable Horror!,3,10 January 2005,"I think that there was an ulterior motive to this production : it was designed so that it could not be critiqued, with out 'spoiling' the film for the reader. But I will try.First the dialog : for those reasons, of which I cannot speak of, was awful. It was as if the cast (which included William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Joaquim Phoenix , Brendon Gleeson and Bryce Howard) had to be untrained to act. It reminded me of a high school Shakespeare production.Why? Why do they speak as though this takes place not here and now but in an unknown time and place not of the choosing of mortal men and of mortal women?Then there was costume and props. They didn't just span decades. They spanned centuries! For those unmentionable things, of which I can not speak, I couldn't figure why this had to be this way. It look as though the village was furnished by PBS's 'Antique Road Show'. Had the costumes and props been consistent, the entire story would have been much more believable. But I will speak no more of this for it is not to be spoken of.And then, everything creaks! Everything. Every step, every door, every box, everything! There are no sounds in the forrest except twigs snapping. No birds, no crickets, no other noises excpt for that swarm of invisible flys .... of which, my sense of sight does not perceive.Then there is the story itself. It seemed to purposely imitate the Stephan King style.Of course there is a 'moral to this story', and it's totally 'retro'. The film missed the point, and the audience by about twenty years.I would not doubt that the imaginative M. Night Shamalan will one day come up with a winner, but ""The Village"" certainly is not it.",The Village

But then again it could be a thriller as there are elements of that as well.Its not really a fantasy per se and the same goes for horror. So what is it? If anything, I think there really needs to be a new genre created for benders like this one. Maybe it should be called the confused genre. I'm not suggesting that the film isn't a good watch. It certainly is entertaining. I just don't know what to call it. Perhaps this is why the film didn't find the audience that Signs and The Sixth Sense did.

247,miken-3,I liked it!,8,24 January 2005,"I know that this movie has a lot of bad reviews because many people did not like the ending. But I did. Though I kind of figured out some of it the first time a creature makes its appearance, I had no problem with it.The acting is first-rate! The movie seems to flow very well. It never seemed to get boring. There is some nice comic relief such as when a group of youths play ""chicken"" against the creatures by going into the woods and seeing how long they can try to attract the creatures before chickening out.I recently read Running Out of Time by Margaret Peterson Haddix and thought that the director might have been influenced by that book!",The Village
248,Poe-17,Way Misunderstood,10,24 January 2005,"I was so ""prepared"" for this movie by all of the reviews by known critics, friends and the social chat. References unerringly cast themselves to the ""Holy Cow"" reveal of ""The Sixth Sense"". Audiences, in general, and in box office receipts, tend to encourage the frustratingly successful strategy of franchise horror films of ""Wow, do that again!"". So, we get a repeat of the original, often the same score, more inventive mayhem but, reduced to twenty five words or less, something one can't differentiate between Part II and Part VI.There was so much made, even by one of my (and much of the free world's) favorite critic's, of the failed twist ending seen coming from miles away and providing a ""you've got to be kidding"" that is a sinking disappointment rather than a skull exploder.By the time I watched the film (I waited for DVD), I knew the elder's secrets and, as all my exposure to the film had warned, the twist was barely a noticeable kink in the plot. But I had he DVD for a five day rental and there was something squirming about my impression, something that wasn't comfortable.I thought about the director's previous; ""The Sixth Sense"" (more than a few of us ""got it"" when the boy explained that sometimes the dead don't know they're dead - but it spoiled nothing), ""Unbreakable"" in which the ""twist ending"" was merely ending, not intended to be twisted and ""Signs"" where all the twists happened during, not at the end where all the ""twists"" merged. It occurred to me that ""Unbreakable"" was not ""The Sixth Sense II"", nor was ""Signs"" ""The Sixth Sense III"", so why should ""The Village"" be ""The Sixth Sense IV""? I thought I might want to watch it again.M. Night Shyamalan, in my opinion, didn't build this film around a twist ending (as well as ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs""), that the twist ending franchise is a figment of the viewers imagination or ""do again"" wishes.Pure and simple, this is a multi-layered love story. Not a chick flick romance but one that addresses the very real fears of parents because they love their children, of heroism because ""I fear for you before all others"", and of a forest full of monsters of unexpected kinds that must be crossed ... for love.Shyamalan likes to tell his stories with a tapestry of strange, vexing and magical images and back drops. But strange, vexing and magical are the tapestry, not the stories he tells.The tale told in ""The Village"" could not have been told without ""The Village"". Joaquin Phoenix's character (Lucius Hunt) could not exist anywhere but in the Village. None of the plot elements would have worked anywhere but in a Village. I don't know what came first to Shyamalan, but I imagine it evolved in senses and chunks and emotions and sort of oozed from the creative extrusion ports. And nowhere in the world could Ivy Walker (Bryce Howard in an incredible delivery) exist and launch the love-driven quest she made except from a Village.On repeated viewings, my vote is this is Shyamalan at the top of his voyage, to date. There are incredibly powerful scenes, positively dazzling deliveries by non-name brand actors (Adrien Brody as Noah Percy is, hands down, Oscar worthy; magnificent), heart, spirit, that moody thing that Shyamalan does so very well, emotional rewards, dead on score, mysteries only unearthed by a second viewing and did I mention Bryce Howard in an absolutely, kick your legs out from under you delivery? Second and Third viewings let you see all the details come together, watch the ending embrace the beginning. This is a cohesive tale, told with color and lack of color, one of courage and yielding to that which requires bravery and courage because ""I don't worry about what might happen, only what must be done"".There is, within the plot, the world's best marriage proposal.Here again, as in ""Signs"", Joaquin Phoenix builds a believable character (though pertinent only for 2/3s of the movie).Sorry, nothing misses. This film is dead on, solid perfect. The ""Twist"" didn't work because it wasn't meant to. Everything else worked because that's what the director wanted to happen.Best to date for Shyamalan .",The Village
249,I_Love_Spielberg,This movie's very underrated.,10,13 August 2008,"""The Village"" is about a close-knit community isolated from everything else in Pennsylvania. This community has never left because there are creatures in the woods that are lethal.This is, overall, my favorite M. Night Shyamalan movie. The sad thing is, is that it's so underrated. I don't understand what people don't like about it. There's a great message to it, and people just don't see it. It's a shame, because ""The Village"" is a great movie, with great performances, especially from Bryce Dallas Howard who's brilliant as Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of one of the elders.So, if you've heard anyone say that this is a bad movie, don't listen to them.

250,hung_fao_tweeze,Worth a viewing,6,19 September 2011,"Shyamalan tries to be a latter day Hitchcock - even down to his cameos. Unfortunately he is lacking something. I've seen Hitchcock's 'Psycho' numerous times and despite knowing the ending I am still compelled to see it again. Meanwhile, I've seen Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' once and am not compelled to see it again. Both movies have twisty endings but nothing in the performances, nuances, camera angles, etc., manage to make me want to see 'Sixth Sense' again. The same holds true for 'The Village'. It's a good story. Everyone in the cast does a good job and the plot twists are very interesting - yet, after the movie ends I don't feel like I've just seen a 'great movie' with layer upon layer of subtle and magnetic character idiosyncrasies. It's all fairly straightforward ultimately. Besides, I pretty much figured it out long before the end. Something didn't quite gel in the props department for me to believe that this was supposed to take place in the time period implied. In all honesty I did think about the film quite a bit afterward. I was mostly wondering how it would hold itself together --- enough on that though. Bottomline: It's a film worthy of a viewing - definitely, but it's like Chinese food -- you'll be hungry in an hour and not necessarily for more Chinese food. I gave it a 6 simply because there is little replay value. It is at least a 7 though.",The Village
251,GTeixeira,An excellent concept wasted in a boring and dull soap opera,4,12 August 2013,"Typical of M. Night Shyamalan, 'The Village' is a film that tries to create a solid story in order to hit the viewer with a clever twist that totally changes the perception of the story you just saw.In here we are introduced to an isolated village, which maintains itself thanks to a pact with the creatures who inhabit the surrounding woods. But when one young villager proposes to cross the woods to find medical supplies, the creatures start to act up...The twist, whether you expected it or not, is very clever. It is easily the best thing in the entire movie; however, it becomes almost ridiculous and laughable when put it together with everything that led up to it.'The Village' is slow, boring, and visually dull. The dialogue is terribly written, seeming more like a bad soap opera than a period film, and the acting is horrible. Adrien Brody is nothing more than an irritating caricature of the village idiot, acting like a retarded clown and destroying any and all scenes he is on. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard have no chemistry whatsoever, and their scenes together are cringe-worthy; even separated, Phoenix is apathetic most of the film and Howard seems to forget her character is blind from time to time. William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are merely decent.There is no atmosphere to go along with Shyamalan's tries at creating thrills. There are a lot of glaring logic problems, too: Shyamalan forces his characters to make nonsense decisions/actions, and sometimes disregard logic in order for some plot elements to work. The fact this is meant to be an allegory for terrorism or whatever (sincerely, some people look too far in order to justify crap) only makes this somewhat laughable.This had the potential to be excellent, but ended up as a complete bore. The twist, the excellent soundtrack (one of the best I can remember of) and the way 'Scary Movie 4' spoofed it are the only favorable things I can think of in regards to Shyamalan's 'The Village'.",The Village
252,AbhiMathews,Let's play a game,7,8 April 2016,"There are different types of horror films one can imagine. Some may immediately think of The Exorcist, while others may consider films similar to Spoorloos the subtlest yet scariest of them all. Whatever your preference, The Village is unsettling in more than one regard. From the disturbing happenings in the beginning, this movie constantly questions your understanding of the environment. You are initially introduced to this secluded land much like the other villagers, and only know what you've been told. Therefore, it's a mystery you are unravelling as the different characters begin to reveal more and more of themselves. To figure out what's going on, if anything, you'll just have to watch this film. Playing the The Village was certainly a lot of fun and I'd highly recommend it to anyone curious enough. It makes you question how much you know of your surroundings, which unfortunately, we often know little about. We often take others' words for granted, but sometimes it's best to think a little and figure things out on your own.",The Village
253,TerminalMadness,Don't go into the woods... (Breaking this down),10,17 August 2004,"After lots of cryptic movie posters all over the walls in theaters, posters that showed two hands holding a letter, posters that wouldn't tell a thing to the casual movie-goer, after cryptic television teasers, commercials that gave nothing away but still kept audiences shocked with its atmosphere induced images, and after a really cheesy really bad mock-documentary exploring the ""Secrets of M. Night Shyamalan"" which ended up being nothing than a promotional program , director M. Night Shyamalan has again kept audiences wondering, has kept the media guessing, and has kept critics talking.I, being a big fan of recent Shyamalan outings, my favorite being ""Signs"", I sat in anticipation awaiting Shyamalan's next brainteaser, and I wasn't disappointed. The new film from the director who brought us some truly groundbreaking brainteasers, this time centers around a small village of people in the 1800's, they're a small Utopian society with families and law givers, a committee of elders who watch over the town of Covington and decide for them, and they have their gatherings and drama like every other town, however, they cannot walk outside of the borders of their town.At night they watch the woods with torches up at every point of the border into the woods and if they breach it they risk disturbing the mysterious force within the trees, a force that watches them. The elders include a group of older people including William Hurt who plays the dignified Edward Walker who watches over his people and gives speeches in nearly every scene, and then there's the younger generation including the very funny, always likable Judy Greer who plays Kitty Walker the sister desperate to be married, Greer is very good in the film, his love interest Alice Hunt who rules alongside him, then there's the mentally disabled Noah Percy who's friends with Ivy Walker, the beautiful younger sister of Kitty, Ivy played by Bryce Dallas Howard in her feature film debut.Daughter of Ron Howard, Howard is just incredible, stealing the show, but we'll get back to her in a minute. Finally, there's Lucius Hunt, the silent but sometimes heroic man of the village who doesn't say much and isn't good with words but nonetheless follows orders and serves as one of the night watchmen who nervously look on in the trees. But when the force of the forest begins to break the truce created decades ago, the villagers begin to look for a way to stop them and live in peace once again.Within the characters, there are love triangles. Kitty is in love with Lucius, who is in love with Ivy, but is afraid to admit it, and Ivy is friends with Noah who is also in love with Ivy. And with the spirit of ""Wuthering Heights"" the romances take their place, courtesy of Judy Greer who plays the all too forward Kitty who has a really funny scene in the beginning setting up Ivy's entrance. Ivy is blind but within her disability lies some sort of precognitive ability to see people, or as she says ""their color"".While her disability is a bit inconsistent throughout the film, Howard is just breathtaking. Any person who is a fan of Shyamalan, or has seen much of his films will definitely be looking for points in the film that will lead to a surprise ending or major plot twist and they will be looking for objects that bear a sign to what would lead to an ending, which Shyamalan has conditioned his audience to do, but while, as usual, in every Shyamalan film there are surprises, but what I won't reveal if there is a surprise ending or not.True, I do tend to give away a lot in my reviews, but not this time. I want you to go into this film with a clueless attitude, and you will be clueless. Here are my clues to the story: No, they are not ghosts from the past, they are not aliens or any other unearthly being, and they are definitely not superheroes, but the story is quite tragic with a sense of Romeo and Juliet mixed with ""Wuthering Heights"". This is indeed a romance film with dread, a romance with a sense of urgency that Shyamalan masters from beginning to end, a romance with many dimensions. The heavy feeling of dread with Shyamalans direction make the woods seem simply horrifying and just beautiful all at the same time, there are shots in the film that are stunning and Shyamalan creates a sort of dream-like land with the woods becoming its own character amidst the cast.Every tree takes on a life of its own, every shadow, every branch, and every scene seems meticulously filmed to make the story complete. There are scenes in the film that demonstrate Shyamalans talent for color as he makes the land of Covington so colorful, so magical while he makes the woods shown in the finale seem so pale, placid, and at night utterly horrifying. Shyamalan takes childhood fears: the woods, darkness, sounds, and brings it back to us in droves with some truly scary imagery particularly the scenes with the watchtower as the woods loom below in the darkness.Once again, there's a heavy significance of color use in Shyamalan's films. For The Sixth Sense there was red, for ""Unbreakable"" there was green, for ""Signs"" there was blue, and for this there's a heavy use of the colors of red and yellow, two colors which can be seen throughout the film a lot. As with ""The Sixth Sense"" red is a dreadful color meant to symbolize death, and in this film it is quite a dangerous sign, but I won't reveal for what. Many of the usual Shyamalan signs are here. The significance of water, the over the shoulder camera views where we hear a character's voice but never see their face, and of course, Shyamalan's teasing of sound, his best attribute when directing a film. Shyamalan's best attributes during his films are color and sound. He has a gift with making sound seem so threatening, the slightest sound in the film makes all the difference and for this, sound is a horrifying notion. All activity stops when there's sound in the woods, many of the scenes are silent with only music, and many of the key scenes in the film have no soundtrack. The woods become a character and presence, because of Shyamalan's focus of sound within the confines of the trees. Every twig snap, every creak, every moan is amplified and frightening.Amidst ""The Village"" there are some excellent performances including William Hurt who is finally put to use in a film as the town elder, Judy Greer who is entertaining and funny to watch, Joaquin Phoenix, an always likable aspect in every film he's in is excellent as the silent and noble Lucius who has a lot of bottled emotions but little ways to show them because of his lack of skill in speaking, Adrien Brody off his Oscar winning stint in ""The Pianist"" is excellent as Noah the mentally handicapped innocent who has a thing for Ivy though he never really knows how to show it. The two have a special bond and their relationship is something to watch for here.I am never expecting a great performance from the child of a famous actor or director in Hollywood because either they barely make it out of the park ala Alyson Eastwood, or they're just never heard from again after a movie or two. There's Sofia Coppola who gave a horrible debut in her first and only acting role in ""Godfather 3"", but then there's Michael Douglas, son of Kirk Douglas who managed to individuate from his fathers legend with his own skill for acting.Which category does Bryce Dallas Howard fall into? Douglas' category. Howard, who replaced Kirsten Dunst (who dropped out due to scheduling conflicts), is incredible in the lead role as Ivy, the blind and sometimes mystical girl in the village. Howard gives a breathtaking performance in the film and she will definitely make a name for herself setting herself apart from the tag of ""Ron Howard's daughter "". I have faith that she will become a landmark in acting for the new generation of actors. She will break from her fathers shadow with her vulnerability and grace echoing Audrey Hepburn, her powerful on-screen presence and range echoing Meryl Streep along with unique beauty that seems to radiate on-screen. Simply, she steals the show and Shyamalan makes a great casting choice here.All the while, Shyamalan has another very sophisticated story to tell, an intricate, meticulous, and very pleasant film to watch with beautiful direction and a very sad and tragic story beneath its facade of horror. Movie critics are so quick to pick apart and dissect everything M. Night Shyamalan does maybe because he's so brilliant, his character depth and stories so linear and meticulous, or maybe our modern culture has grown to the point where we don't want a story anymore, we just want a quick fix along with explosions and gore. Perhaps they're threatened by him, or maybe I'm being dramatic, but you're going to be looking for a plot twist, but look at the acting, look at the beautiful direction, and look at the touching story of humanity and the all too relevant message Shyamalan puts across of how human nature is that, human nature, and part of our nature is violence regardless of how you try to break it down. Shyamalan brings about a truly modern message told within a fantastic tale and I urge you to pay attention to everything else and stop trying to look for the twist, and for the critics, Shyamalan is an excellent storyteller and his themes are universal, so why simply pull his films apart? Shyamalan challenges our imaginations, scares us all the while bringing us his message of violence, government, politics, love, and social commentary within the concept. And again, my wait for Shyamalan's next film begins.",The Village

But I was surprised to see a film which actually wanted to say something, and did it in a good way.For me, THE VILLAGE is probably the best Shamalayan film I've seen, since this is not only good cinema - it also has an underlying theme and story that tries to criticize our world. It's well done.The twists and turns are good, and the last twist is best.Best are the actors, dialog and feeling/mood. However, the film is too long and could've used some editing.Nice little movie that could've been filmed for $1 Million, and still worked wonders. Shamalayan is overpriced, and he's not worth his salary, but at least he gives us some good entertainment for the moment.I want to give this one a 6 out of 10, since it has some great ideas, even though it's painfully slow and boring at some times. Nice to watch alone a rainy day.",The Village
255,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of The Village,7,31 July 2004,"For those wanting to know not of the film's secrets, This review must not be seen Never enter the review, That is where the spoilers wait These are the rules of watcher of the woods Heed this warning now, For they are coming In the last couple of years, the supernatural thriller genre has belonged mainly to one man: writer/director M. Night Shyamalan. Though several have tried to copy his style of film-making and the signature twist endings, few have developed the same kind of success that he currently enjoys, whether it be the numbers at the box office or the fan base his films have built up. Ever since 1999's surprise hit, The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan has been scaring movie-goers across the world with his takes on ghosts, superheroes and aliens but after several years it seems he may be giving the old gig a break. The latest rumblings from Hollywood saying that The Village may be the last thriller in awhile as his next project is set to be the film adaptation of the hit novel, The Life of Pi. Preferably he would like to go out on top with the genre he made his own playground but that is all up to how the American public receive it, either as another success or a failure.The story centers on an isolated group of villagers who find themselves confined to their town by the mysterious creatures that roam the woods that encircle them. In the year 1897, the village of Covington, Pennsylvania can be seen as the prime example of a utopian society  there is no violence, no greed, and all work together in upholding the vision of hope that has driven the villagers to bountiful blessings, something the elders of the town believe will continue through the leadership of their children. Covington, to the untrained eye, may seem perfect but the element of fear still dwells within the occupants of the town. What would inhabitants of a utopian society such as this have to fear? 'Those we do not speak of'  red hooded creatures that reside in the woods and make raids on the town when they feel they have been threatened. None have the courage to venture beyond the forbidden border, except Lucius Hunt, the head strong yet reserved son of Alice Hunt, one of the town elders. Lucius feels compelled to defy the boundaries of the village but at the same time he dares not leave out of the fear, the only one he has, that harm will come to Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of the leading town elder with whom he has fallen deeply in love with. But when an accident occurs in the village and Lucius is found deeply hurt, Ivy demands that she be given permission to enter the woods and obtain medicine from the nearby towns.The story for The Village suffers from an acute identity crisis in that it plays out more like an extended episode of The Twilight Zone then usual Shyamalan thriller audiences have come associate his films with. That is not to say that it doesn't try, in fact the first half is quite engaging, it's just that it fails to ends the same way. Another Shyamalan thriller, The Sixth Sense, shares a similar trait with this film, the less then surprising twist at the end. If The Village was able to have as genuine and masterfully orchestrated a plot as The Sixth Sense had then it wouldn't be a problem. Unfortunately, Shyamalan demonstrates that either he is losing his once golden touch or he is running low on decent material to scare audiences with.With as talented a group of performers as is seen in The Village, the most high-profile cast ever assembled by director M. Night Shyamalan, you would think it would no problem for a film with the least orchestrated storyline to be raised to the level of a tolerable feature but that isn't true here. Bryce Dallas Howard, the daughter of director Ron Howard, makes a surprisingly brilliant debut in the role of Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of leading town elder. All Shyamalan films contain a lead role that tests even the most skilled of actors and Howard is able to tackle the role easily without showing once any inability to rise to the challenge, which indicates she could be a rising star in Hollywood if she continues to give prime performances such as this. Joaquin Phoenix, in the role of Lucius Hunt, demonstrates that he can lead a film with an engaging and emotionally driven performance that goes way beyond the role given to him in Signs. And Adrien Brody gives an emotionally charged roller coaster performance as the mentally challenged Noah. There are times where he can make you laugh, make cry, have you feel sorry for him only to turn around and do something that provokes the opposite effect with the audience. The character of Noah is the combination of both the talent of Brody and dexterous construction from Shymalan's script. The problem with the cast is that there are too many of them for the audience to keep track of each individual character plot. The brilliance about Shyamalan's past films was that he kept the group of characters relatively small in order to allow the audience to singularly focus on the actions of the main characters and not have them confused by separate character developments. The filmmaker diverts from his usually agenda and that in effect hurts the film's script deeply.Overall, writer/director M. Night Shyamalan trades in his philanthropic messages on humanity and supernatural fantasies brought to life for cheap scares and a story that may turn out to be an accidental rip off of a classic sci-fi television series. Though Shyamalan makes no direct assertions within the nearly two hour feature and quite possibly leaves this up to interpretation, there is the slight assumption that The Village may be a political commentary on the current climate of the United States after September 11th.What evidence within the framework of the film would support this theory? For starters, the color coded system the villagers develop, yellow to indicate safety and red to imply fear and danger, overtly resembles the terrorism warning levels developed by Homeland Security after the attacks on September 11th. The creatures that wander the woods and raid the town when threatened are nothing more then false reports developed by the elders to keep the townspeople in fear and prevent them from leaving the village, which may be a reference to the accusations made by the liberals about the Bush administration whenever they release a terror alert. And the most convenient piece of evidence lies in the name of the lead elder who orchestrates the entire façade: Walker, which may or may not be an allusion to the current commander in chief's middle name. Granted the deception was in an effort to preserve innocence but in the minds of some individuals, deception is deception no matter the reason.Even if that theory is proven correct, only a hand full of individuals will probably pick up on that message and doesn't affect a person's perception of the film much if one disagrees with the assertion that may or may not be made. In other aspects of the film, James Newton Howard is once again able to calibrate a successful and chilling musical score that works directly in sync with the actions on screen, as he has been able to do in all of Shyamalan's films in the past. And even though Shyamalan's engaging sense of direction allows the psychological intensity of the film to remain intact through nearly the entire presentation, the less then surprising outcomes makes it out to be all for naught. There are three twist endings to the film: the first seems misplaced as it totally eliminates the element of fear that is associated with the creatures, the second isn't so much a problem as it is obvious especially if you're one who pays close attention to certain characters, and the final twist gives you the feeling as though you were watching an episode of The Twilight Zone, leaving the audience neither shocked nor amazed, just swindled. But the film's most disappointing aspect is the fact that the audience is left at the end with nothing; no fear, no hope. The Village is the first Shyamalan thriller that eliminates the sense of fear movie-goers would take home with them when it reveals the creatures weren't real. This was the key that made Shymalan thrillers classics to so many people. Whether it is political allegory or just pure coincidence, anyway you slice it The Village is a drawn out disappointment.",The Village

I am very angry that I wasted my time and spent good money on this terrible film!  What is this director thinking?!  Is he crazy or something?!  This is one of the worst movies I had ever seen and believe me, I have seen movies that are below B-type movies.  This movie is an ""F"" movie!  It's been several hours since I had left the movie theater but I am still angry!This director portrays this movie as some thriller/horror movie but it was neither thrilling nor scary.  The only horrible thing was the idiots who approved the making of this film.  I will tell you how bad the movie was...for one hour and twenty minutes, nothing happened in this DAMN movie!!!  I wish I could write a whole bunch of expletives here because this film deserves that and more!When I found out what the secret that the village held, I just wanted to throw my beverage at the damn movie screen!  After that, I did not even wait for the movie to end.  I told my friend I am going to the snack bar in the theater and that he could meet me there once the movie is over.  The funny thing is once I started leaving, a whole bunch of people left as well.  Some of us congregated outside and cursed at the movie and the idiot director who made it.I mean, what was the director thinking when he made this film?  Was he on drugs?  Did he lose all creativity?  I do not have the answer but I know this, I will never go see his films in the future again.Below is the spoiler....of one hour and twenty minutes of the terrible film.
********SPOILERS********************The film never states it but it looks like the film takes place around 1800's in America, in some wooded area with a large clearing where this village exist.  The woods are supposedly inhabited by creatures that the villagers coined, ""the ones we do not speak of.""  The villagers cannot leave because the creatures will not let them.  It seems these creatures will not let visitors in as well.  The villagers and the creatures have an agreement to where the villagers will not enter the woods and in return, the creatures will not enter the village.  The villagers also offer animal sacrifices to the creatures.  Things began to go awry in the village when one of their members become ill.  He needs medical attention but such things are not available in the village.  One of the village member want to leave to go to the town for medical supply but is discouraged.  One of the village elders cannot take the charade any longer and shows the daughter a costume of the creature and reveals to her that the creatures do not exist and that it was created by the village elders to keep everyone inside the village.  They wanted to create some sort of utopia for themselves and their children, but importantly, they wanted no outsiders to influence their children.***********END SPOILERS***********************

257,evilmatt-3,Are you serious?,3,1 August 2004,"I'm feeling generous today.  M. Night Shyamalan gets a 3/10 from me because this movie had some decent visuals and a neat beginning concept. Everything- EVERYTHING- else about this movie is terrible.The story has been beaten to death so many times elsewhere that for me to do it yet again here would just be cruelty.  Suffice to it say that the plot of this film is neither suspenseful nor well-written.  Unlike M. Night's earlier transgressions, this one is almost devoid of ALL interesting moments including the patented M. Night Shyamalan Cheap Sound Effects Scare (tm). As I sat there for what seemed like eternity, I was practically bored to tears on several occasions.The acting.  The acting.  The acting.  I have the idea that M. Night thinks it's funny to collect a superb cast and then give them all a terrible script and worse stage direction so that everybody not only turns in the worst performance of their careers, but sound like they are rehearsing a high school play.  I honestly thought for the first half of the movie, ""No, surely the acting cannot be *this* bad by default.  He must be doing it on purpose.""  However, the jilted line delivery, wooden acting, and transparent facades of emotion from such cinematic greats as Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt (and promising newcomers such as Bryce Dallas Howard) continued unabated throughout the entire film.  This is the most painful part of the film, and perhaps M. Night's worst offense yet to American cinema.Because the acting is so terrible, any emotional effect whatsoever that would have been present in the movie is drained.  I simply didn't care whether anyone lived or died, and frankly thought the ""creatures"" were the most interesting thing to look at (if one can properly say that- I won't spoil it here, but suffice it to say that if you go to this movie expecting an in depth exploration of the supernatural, you are going to be angry.)M. Night's latest trend is to include at least one thing in his movie so idiotic that he completely insults even the most basic audience member's intelligence.  Here, he manages to offend through the character of Ivy (to say she was played ineptly by Howard is to be luxuriously kind to both Howard and Shyamalan), who although blind, manages to run though field, woods, and houses without much trouble, can instantly locate any item she needs, looks people in the eyes when talking to them, and can ""see colors"" despite he blindness.  In some scenes, Howard even appear to have forgotten that her character is blind.Shyamalan: Are you serious?  Am I actually to believe that this was a serious attempt at an adult film (let alone a thriller?)  after Signs, I simply called you a bad film maker.  Now, I'm beginning to wonder whether you might actually be mildly retarded.  I hope you're not serious.",The Village
258,kismit,Watchable but not scary enough.,7,1 August 2004,"After the silliness of Signs, ""hit em with a baseball bat and a glass of water"" this film is a bit of a return to form the director. Unfortunately, that means more buildup and less payoff than ever. I liked it but I have to wonder if a lot of the spookiness was lost on the cutting room  floor. A really strong cast but no meat in any of the roles except for Hurt and Howard. Bryce Howard has inherited her father's disturbed apple pie face and some of his talent. If you think Shyamalan directs horror movies you will be disappointed. If you don't judge it be the standard set by Sixth Sense it is definitely worth a look.",The Village

That was a cleverly constructed plot with engaging characters.This one seems to have been written by a ten-year-old.You can't transgress the boundary, or ""those we do not speak of"" will get you. The dialogue is excruciating. In the end, I was hoping the unspeakables would just raid the village and do away with its inhabitants merely because that would mean I wouldn't have to listen to their drivel anymore.Near me in the cinema, there were two people chatting constantly throughout the film . Normally I'd have a go at them for being so inconsiderate, but with this film I didn't feel it was justified. I'm sure their conversation was far more entertaining than the rubbish on the screen.",The Village
261,cafesmitty,A fan of m. night's but not a fan of this film,6,4 August 2004,"The Village, the latest film from producer, director, writer and actor M. Night is a story about a small village surrounded by trees and mysterious creatures that roams the woods.  The creatures and the villagers live in harmonious peace as long as the villages don't ever enter the woods.  Ah, but something is a-foul here and, or course, that trust is broken.  So anyone that is familiar with M. Night's films, they know there is a twist in the film.  When they reveal the twist in the films, I was thinking, so what.  There is nothing shocking, nothing unique, in fact the film is rather boring.  It is slow in the beginning, slow in the middle, had a couple of interesting points, but that is about it.  I mean, you are going to be sitting there and really not care.  They have the ever boring William Hurt who mistakes indifference for acting.  Joaquim Phoenix repeats his same sense of acting he used in SIGNS in this film and while it seems fresh in SIGNS, he style is quite boring in this film.  Sigourney Weaver is just a name in this film and completely wasted.  She isn't require to do much but be a familiar face you have seen in films before.  Adrian Brody does a good job, a bit over the top at times, but it's nice to see him getting more parts and he pulls his character off rather well.  The bright spot, the star of the film is Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard.  I guess those acting classes really paid off.  She reminds me of a younger Mia Farrow.    But the main problem is the writing.  It is so uninspiring and M. Night's gimmick is getting kind of old now.  It is obvious that Alfred Hitchcock was a big influence on him in not only in film making, but now it becomes a game to see if you can spot the director.  Still, I cannot fault the young director because he is trying and he is different.  Unfortunately the advertisement for the Village is better than the actual movie.  I just wish the film lived up to it's potential.",The Village

Let me explain.I really hated, because it isn't what I thought it was. I expecting it to be like all of the other M. Night movies, but this was in a different category all together. I should have known something was different when they used his other movies to promote this one.Now with that being said, if you can go to the theatre now and forget everything you know about M. Night's movies then you really enjoy it.This was an awesome period piece with a whole lot of symobollism. I thought it was well directed and well acted. In retrospect, when you figure out the suprise twist, you realize exactly what makes this movie so powerful.M. Night has the ability to completly draw you into the worlds in his movies. No one, whether they hated it or liked, can say they were not curious to find out what type of thing resided in those woods and what kept those people alive for all of those years.It's a really good movie, it just want be if you compare it to his other movies. I think they made a really bad marketing strategy to use his other movies to promote this one. It is going to make it really hard on M. Night fans to beleive any more promotions.Go and see this movie. It's always good to see movies that get mixed reviews.I give it 8 if I didn't know M. Night directed it. I give it 5, since I knew he did.",The Village
264,botfeeder,"had to research what ""the twist"" was",7,10 October 2020,"After watching this movie, I saw all this discussion about ""the twist"". Many critics apparently didn't like it, a lot of reviewers here apparently did.I could not for the life of me figure out what was this ""twist"". So I did some googling and found a review that discussed it.Apparently it had to do with the village not being in the 19th century but rather in the present. But I never had a preconception about what time period it was, I figured for all we know it could be a contemporary community sort of like the Amish. When Ivy was headed toward town one notion I had was that she'd wind up at a Walgreens.Anyway, overall I thought it was pretty good. A lot of times I agree with the other reviewers and this is one case, I was on the border between a 6 and 7 and gave it the benefit of the doubt.",The Village

It exceeds my expectations... but then again I kinda didn't like that. The movie bases itself out in the wilderness in a vacant field where a small Amish community lives. No one is allowed in the woods because of the creatures that live in there. The creatures are called Those We Don't Speak Of, if memory serves correctly. One day a young male villager goes into the woods and comes back. That basically ticks off Those We Don't Speak Of and from there on things start to get ugly. The plot really is kinda genius if you take the time to think it over after the movie ends. There are somethings that I wish would just change about this one. It's good, but at the same time it's bad.",The Village
266,windypoplar,"weird and involving, but what was the point?",5,3 November 2006,"First off let me state that I thought this was a very unfairly criticized film. It's actually quite good. The pacing, acting (more on that shortly), and atmosphere were excellent. As social commentary, the film is fine, ranking with the best films of this short decade.It is rife with problems though. Firt off Bryce Dallas Howard is simply awful in every scene. Has anyone ever seen a worse portrayal of a blind person? Justine Bateman was ten times more believable in a TV-movie! She simply doesn't register at all with me. Sort of like Particia Arquette, who is much better on television. The look of the film is great. It invades you with dread and misgivings. William Hurt is so into his part here it hard to understand him at times. Much like I would think a 19th century person would be to us. Sigourney Weaver is good, but underused. Adrien Brody reminds you why he won an Oscar, and will win more. Joaquin Phoenix is great, as always, but why does he play three different roles here? Did I miss something? The ""twist"" in the village, I wont reveal it all but... Is good, just a bit unrealistic. Sort of like the old Twilight Zone where Roddy McDowall ends up in the zoo. Okay, but not exactly true to life. The reason for the village is good, but lets face it, utopias don't work. Endowing this one with its own myths was a good idea though and works very well with Brody's character. Overall I thought the film was OK, just not as good as it should have been, with such a talented cast. It haunts you, but leaves too many holes to be really satisfying.",The Village
267,~AleXa~,Can we say propaganda?,5,2 August 2004,"Can we say propaganda? Personally, I feel that M. Night Shyamalan's name was attached to this movie for sole purpose of enticing everyone and their dog to go see it. One of the main purposes of the film medium is to communicate a message or messages to those that watch, but a message is only effective when the viewers are receptive to it. You do NOT advertise a movie as a scary horror flick and then try to make a profound statement to the viewers and expect them to hear it. Knowing M. Night Shyamalan's work and style, I wasn't just expecting a good scare, but an *intelligent* scare. I found neither of which. The plot was very poorly structured, the dialogue was weak and the whole concept just felt forced not to mention it's been done before. What I keep coming back to is that not only does this movie lack Shyamalan's stylistic touch, but it lacks substance. I just felt it to be very hollow, and maybe that's because it wasn't what I expected, but I do not feel that Shyamalan brought anything new to the idea. The whole point of this movie could've been communicated in three sentences--it was not worth the hour and a half of my life I lost.
And not to say this was a horrible movie, just very mediocre and lacking. I would've never thought that Shyamalan did this movie--he had a point, but didn't know how to make it, and as such, the movie is just lost on everyone. The one thing I would say to those who haven't seen it is that if you're just looking for a good scare, you WILL be disappointed; this is NOT the intelligent thriller it's made out to be.5 out of 10",The Village
268,jjnoahjames,One of Shams best!,9,30 December 2009,"Just an all around great M. Night Shamalayn movie. Love what the movie is about. It's extremely interesting. It's sort of a classic. The acting was very successful and believable otherwise this movie would have bombed. I don't think most critics take this into account. I also like how ""mysterious"" this movie comes across. It's an attribute Sham drowns out with Lady in The Water and The Happening but does not here. The acting of Bryce Howard is her best thus-far along with Adrien Brody, and Joaquin who are also phenomenal like usual. Lastly like all great movies there is a really thought provoking end to round it all out.",The Village
269,Snoopy1,"Great concept, boring movie",3,2 August 2004,"I was excited to see ""The Village""...I went into the theater knowing nothing about it except that it was directed by M. Night.  Since I appreciated his previous efforts, especially ""The Sixth Sense"", I was eager to see this film.I came out of the theater feeling disappointed.  While the idea for the movie was interesting, the actual movie was beyond dull.  The majority of the movie was filled with unrelated filler material.  The Ivy and Lucious affair came out of nowhere.  They seemingly had no relationship, then they began to talk about getting married?  And why did they spend time with the storyline about Lucious and Ivy's sister?  It was completely unrelated. 
I understand that films such as this are building up to SOMETHING...and I find myself getting ansy waiting for the twist.  It's unfortunate that throughout the duration of the movie, I impatiently waited for the twist, as opposed to enjoying every moment of the movie.  When the twist occurred, I wasn't very shocked...I was just thinking, ""Oh.  Okay."" instead of ""OH MY GOD, WOW!""Another irksome quality of this movie was Ivy's hair.  All of the other women had long hair, tied into braids or buns.  Ivy, on the other hand, had short-ish curly hair and it looked like it had a lot of mousse in it.  It looked wrong for their culture, and especially for a blind girl who wouldn't manicure her own hair in that fashion.  They could have easily taken a little bit of extra time to make her hair more appropriate.This screenplay could have been shaved of about an hour of its content and made an interesting episode of ""The New Twilight Zone"", or something to that effect.  I didn't think it deserved a spot on the big screen, and the idea certainly did not need to be flushed out to a full length feature film. 
You can analyze anything deeply and come up with astonishing conclusions...however, I don't feel that there was any strong allegory in this film.  It was supposed to be creepy and it did not deliver.",The Village
270,Sparrow_in_flight,Not so scary,5,11 January 2005,"It had its moments. Sometimes. And it was definitely better than Signs, which was a waste of money, in my opinion. The acting was good - there was no problem there. What was wrong was the plot. How many times have you read a book or seen a movie or TV episode that contains a place no one is allowed to explore? A lot. How many times is said place really as frightening as those who forbid it claim that it is? I admit, that's probably more of a 50/50 chance. How many times is the ending supposed to be a total surprise, and yet is actually totally predictable? Again, probably it is a 50/50. In this case, The Village failed. The ending was very much a predictable outcome: the monsters didn't exist, they were simply a myth. The village is simply a community of those living where the outside world can't reach them, as they are sick of it. The signs, of course, were there along the way: going through the woods for medicines, the group of adults that are hiding something, etc. It's all there, and it's too predictable. If you've never read anything along these lines, or seen anything, you'll probably like it. If you have - don't bother with it.",The Village
271,MovieDude1893,'M. Night Shymalan sells his film soul for the twistless twist',1,9 December 2006,"What can one say about M. Night Shymalan? Perhaps, ""Wow I never saw that coming!"" or ""Jeez! That was completely OBVIOUS!"". He basically had no grey shades. You love him or hate him... I was a lot closer to hate from the beginning.If what I say is true and I do hate him than why to I continuously give his films a chance? Perhaps it's the pedigree of his actors (Mel Gibson. Sam Jackson, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, recently Paul Giamatti.) But I'm thinking it's his uncanny ability of creating an interesting premise... unfortunately his talent goes limp from there. The story of 'The Village' centers around just that: A village. Run by a council known as the elders, the town is constrained to a wooded boundary, outside of which there lie ""Those Who Shall Not Be Spoken Of"" who run around in red robes.Soon, the plucky blind girl of the town must venture past the woods to another town. WHY? Her lover is sick and she's going to get better medicines. First, however, she must have something revealed about not only the town, but also about what lies beyond the village.

A turn of the century, maybe they can scare me by folklore that never amounts to anything. Even ending into todays times.The elders vote on everything but fail to acknowledge as to why this creature of the forest even exists, if it even does. The blind girl that can run like the wind, she can't see where she is going but she can run. She knows when people walk up to her 15 or more feet away but can't sense the red hooded, long nailed, porcupine thing next to her. A really poor account of a blind person, Ivy Elizabeth Walker, shame on you. You go red hooded thingy!Sigourney Weaver should have stayed on the ship in Alien, it was way more scary and a lot more interesting. I can't figure out the 10 star ratings, what did you see that I didn't? I liked Adrien Brody as the idiot, he's done a lot better in other movies but, he was amusing in this. Joaquin Phoenix is also to good for this stuff. Along with William Hurt, really?

273,jhs39,Not much of a surprise,6,30 July 2004,"I figured out the surprise ending of M Night Shyamalan's latest thriller about a half hour in.  The movie is fairly creepy up to that point but, unfortunately, once you figure out what's going on there's little suspense since, as a thriller, The Village is all smoke and mirrors.On the plus side Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix have some nice moments together--The Village actually works much better as a romance than it does as a suspense movie.Of the rest of the cast only William Hurt impresses, giving a strong and nuanced performance.  Adrien Brody seems to be channelling Dwight Frye's Renfield from the Bela Lugosi version of Dracula.  This was a peculiar part, to say the least, for an actor to take following up an Academy Award win. It's a complete waste of his talent and hopefully not a sign of things to come.   On the whole The Village is an ok entertainment but I really think it's time for Shyamalan to rethink his reliance on gotcha endings--his movies have become nothing more than an excuse for the final twist that at this point everyone expects.  It doesn't really show much faith in his characters or in his ability to tell an story that will engage an audience without tricks.  I think the gimmick is wearing thin and that this is going to be his least successful film to date.",The Village
274,jhs39,After more thought...,6,31 July 2004,"I'm writing a follow up comment to one I left right after seeing the movie because the more I think about it, the more frustrated I become.  The Village really could have been so much better than it is and the problem is the ""surprise"" ending, the thing that so many people here are commenting on, but not actually for the reason people are saying.I think M Night Shyamalan (as well as the people who saw The Village and actually thought the ending worked) would benefit greatly from watching an Atom Egoyan film like Exotica.  Egoyan is a truly brilliant filmmaker while Shyamalan is a filmmaker who thinks he's brilliant.  Egoyan delays information to keep the audience off-balance and so they don't immediately know what's going on, but he doesn't keep it for a big twist at the end--the delayed information is parceled out during the course of the movie to enhance dramatic impact.  The Village would have been much more powerful and affecting if Shyamalan had utilized a similar storytelling structure rather than relying so heavily on a rickety would-be surprise ending.  By keeping such a major plot revelation for the very end Shymalan screws up the movie because: a) people like myself who figure out the ending early get bored waiting for the obvious to be revealed and b) people who don't figure out the ending feel cheated because it invalidates what they thought the movie was.  From a marketing standpoint the problem with eliminating the trick ending is that once you do The Village turns into what it really is, a romantic drama rather than a thriller.  The Village isn't a thriller.  The only way Shyamalan can even create the illusion that The Village is a thriller is to withhold crucial information until the very end.  But people who go to The Village expecting to see a thriller will feel duped (as the many angry comments here on the IMDB can attest), and people who actually enjoy the more thoughtful aspects of the story are likely to be frustrated that the structure with its gotcha ending prevents the romance and actual dramatic conflict from being developed to anywhere near the extent that it should have been.As much as I liked parts of The Village, at this point I'm hoping that after the inevitable strong opening weekend it tanks.  Based on recent interviews it seems like M Night Shyamalan judges whether his movies work or not based on their ultimate box office take, so if The Village flops maybe it will force him to actually take a few chances and break free of his formula that is not only showing greatly diminishing returns from movie to movie but, in the case of The Village, turned what could have been a really first rate and thought provoking romantic drama into a mediocre and gimmicky thriller.",The Village

I'd managed to avoid the spoilers before going to see this and so went in with few preconceived expectations as to what sort of film I was going to see.So what type of film is it? Without spoilers, it's hard to describe. It's definitely odd, with an otherworldly feel to it at times. It's the sort of film that would seem perfectly natural with a Rod Serling voice-over before the closing credits roll.It's not the best film I've seen this year, but it's hardly the worst, either. It did, however, pass one important test - my wife stayed awake through it. That may not seem like a big deal, but it is. If any movie drags for more than a couple of minutes, she's out.Some of the developments are easily guessed and some actually sneak up on you, yet it still maintains a good level of tension and audience involvement. With the right frame of mind going in, it can be an enjoyable film.The bottom line: Like most Shaymalan films, I really didn't like it too much (some, I actively despise!)

A couple of people who hide in a Villagebecause they are afraid of the murders, the dead, the war, the bombs, the politics, etc...they scape from the pain, but the pain caught them into their ideal place for living. This is like a weird version of Lord of the flies. You can't hide from the primordial instinct of the human being of being auto-destructive, evil and became a murderer. And the worst thing of all, that the lies will never get away from your life, doesn't matter where you go. But Night, please, do not cheat us again with a surprising ending. No more surprising-no-sense endings.",The Village
278,El Guapo-2,we are the village,10,6 April 2005,"Night has held up the mirror to our faces and we see the reflection. My congratulations to Mr. Phoenix for his interpretation of a true heart. It made the stabbing scene that much more poignant for me. What Night is trying to say here, in case you are dense, is that we are the village and the elders use fear to control our actions and thoughts. Which is probably why the movie got so much negative word of mouth, Americans tend to dis-like it when they contemplate what could be the true nature of our existence. Reference Plato's ""The Cave"" for further information, if you dare! Ms. Howard was in particular very excellent in what could very well be the leading role. Would it not be possible that a blind girl would be the only one with enough courage to do what needs to be done? Ms. Howard has a very bright light shining inside of her.",The Village
279,Ioreka,Oh dear,4,10 May 2020,"A group of (albeit highly talented) exclusively white, non-disabled actors attempt to convince us that they comprise a whole community brought together by extreme hardship. Stereotypes (including portrayals of the 'pretty, plucky blind girl' by a sighted actor, and the tormented, and ultimately dangerous intellectually disabled young man by a non intellectually disabled actor) abound and indeed, in the end, define the film which cannot therefore deliver on the wonderfully eerie atmosphere that it manages at first to create. Individual films cannot on their own be 'representative'. That's a property that is to be judged across an industry.

Bryce Howard is amazing, Phoenix and Brody prove themselves once more in 2 diffucult roles.

281,Faisal_Flamingo,Great Ideas in the Movie Which Are Very Difficult to Handle by a Commercial Director !,5,15 November 2006,"I wouldn't say the village is Shyamalan's worst but it is not a very good movie either .. the movie has great ideas but not very well handled ..I found it very difficult to handle such big ideas by a commercial director like Shyamalan.The idea of escaping the public normal life to live isolated in a village out of some reasons is a brilliant idea but it just doesn't work very well with Shyamalan .. it is too big idea to handle by a commercial director.The acting was good especially by Joaquin Phoenix .. Adrian Brody wasn't that good .. and he was over-reacting in my opinion. William Hurt gave one of his best performances .. and Bryce Dallas Howard was probably the best of them all.Somethings I didn't like such as the scary music which plays to supposedly give us the creep and makes us scream or something .. I think it is a cheesy way to attract the viewer attention .. anyway, what do you expect from a commercial horror movie?In the end, I found myself lost .. the ending is open to many possibilities and maybe Shyamlan was thinking of making a sequel to it.",The Village
282,IamtheRegalTreatment,Why PG-13?,5,15 January 2005,"The Village was not what I had expected. I expected another scary movie where I would jump up during the scary parts, and want to hide my eyes because I could not face the fear. Yet, this movie had less than 3 scary moments (none worthy of a scream), 1 blind woman, 1 mentally retarded person, and a big fence.The point of having this village area was because the starters believed the outside world was a bad bad place, so they secluded themselves and families inside a town surrounded by woods. They told stories for the children saying the woods had ""things they could not speak of"" in there, that would kill if you entered. Later on, this idea would go from PG-13 down to PG. Except for ugly monsters, and some scenes with blood, this movie should never have been questioned above the PG mark. Some of the scenes, yes, were hard to follow and understand, but this is why it is PG! Parental Guidance, which means when you (the 6 year old) is confused, you ask you parental guardian what the heck is going on.5/10.

It's twist in the final reel is something you will gladly accept or angrily dismiss.The trailer unfortunately is pitched at a horror/suspense audience when ultimately the film is an intelligent look at how some members of society long for the safety and seclusion of a world cut off from modern life.Everything about this film is quality, Roger Deaking's stunning visuals, Shyamalan's crafty and suspenseful direction, superb performances, particularly Bryce Dallas Howard.Despite having worked out the ""twist"" within 15 minutes of The Sixth Sense, I've all enjoyed all Shyamalan's films, yes even Unbreakable, and if you enjoyed his previous three films then expect once more to be taken on a journey with more than a few surprises.Another example of intelligent film-making that despite being pitched at an 18-30 audience through its misleading trailer, will probably be more enjoyed by us folks older than that age range, who enjoy films dealing with mature themes.Thoroughly recommended.",The Village

Who isn't the star of the film!?!?!?!?! I didn't read up on this film before walking into the cinema but the trailer campaign completely took on the notion that this was a Phoenix Vs.

This wasn't the case.This is a film about paranoia & modern western world society I guess!I'd say to anyone considering watching ""The Village"" I'd say yes, watch it, have an opinion ...

Seeing Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Jesse Eisenberg, Brendan Gleeson, Cherry Jones, Judy Greer and Michael Pitt, among others, all together in an M.

286,akon5,"Its really scary, it is so bad, it is extremely scary...",4,10 January 2005,"I don't know what is wrong all the reviewers. I also do not know what is wrong with Mr. Night. It seemed that he just gone from great with his Sixth Sense to bad to worst. Writing your own scripts and directing it is an excellent move, however, it does not mean it will always work out. In the later cases of Night's movies, it appeared that he rushed his scripts and did not take any care at all on examining his plot or characters. When you have characters explaining things near the end of the film to the audience and when the dialogs are said purely to explain something to us, we know there is something wrong. And when the plot had to be twisted so much in order to fit everything in and rendered it so twisted it became disfigured and disjointed, it is another bad sign.Mr. Night used to be compared with Mr. Hitchcock, I would dare say this comparison is getting a little too absurd. Intelligent scripts are not easy to come by and intelligent scripts with symbolic meanings are even harder to come by. If one is to argue the fact that this movie is also about the supression of a community through the usage of fear etc...I would have to conclude that you had watched very little old films of the great eras of Hithcocks and other great directors.",The Village

I hate thee with an all-consuming passion, a terrible madness borne of shock and disappointment, lies and deceit, rage and damnable fury!I hate thee as I have hated none before. I burn as a never-ending fire in the deepest pit of Hell. And I thirst for revenge, for recrimination, and for the recoupment of my six pence. For thine is the foolishness, and the folly, and the awfully written screenplay that thou hast so miserably directed and produced!I hate thee in thine overall conceit, thy trickery and thy lies, thy foolish fear of prescribed colors (red). Most of all I hate thoust terrible dialog, much of the wretched squabble consisting of the phrase, ""those we dare not speak of."" Such foolishness, indeed! Because in point of fact, much of the entire scenario consists of witless fools speaking of such!I hate thee to thine very core, thine deepest marrow and beyond. I despise thy story from whence thoust came. I am sickened by the deceitful acting, and the foolish costumes, and the ridiculousness of the otherwise good player Brody, who is senselessly depicted here as rather a foolish clown! I am revolted that the other good players, the Hurt and the Weaver, these fine performers who were trapped into the folly and who surely knew not of what was to come! And I pray that with the grace of God, these pitiable persons, both elders and young ones, such as the Dallas Howard, will not suffer unduly hereafter due to their dreaded missteps into this pointless and misguided debacle!I hate thee thoroughly and finally. I hate not merely the whole, but every wretched portion. I hate each damnable frame, every putrid sprocket hole, each and every foolish and misbegotten conceit that was dredged from some dark and damnable place and foisted upon thy glorious silver screen!More than anything, I hate thee for this simple reason: that good and uncorrupted souls duly followed thou into thoust folly and were betrayed! Good and proper Cinema lovers, knowing full well their monies could never be refunded, trusted and waited, hoped and dreamed! But such was not to be. Because when thoust light flickered from thy projector, and when those damnable images burst forth and the foolish voices spoke, those blessed patrons were shocked and shamed beyond words! Time and precious money gone, hopes and fanciful dreams crushed. Good and proper minds laid to waste by such unfathomable nonsense and misbegotten folly!And more's the pity! That many of these trusting souls held thoust in highest regard due to thine past work, thine prior achievements, which in mine humble personal regard, may not have been divine masterpieces as such, but, it can be said, were good and entertaining diversions -- to a degree.But -- blast! With thoust latest execrable debacle, thou hast made a mockery of them all! Thou hast lured unsuspecting souls into thine theatre of pain and shattered their hopeful spirit! Dost thou arrogance and contempt know no Earthly bounds? Hast thou no shame!? Indeed -- for in perpetrating such degrading folly, no greater fool is revealed -- than thee!Thine pretentiousness overfloweth! Indeed, thine lack of ability and talent has never been more true or fully evident, and thine justification for ceasing all future moving picture production now and evermore I dare say has never been more plainly clear!And so I say unto you, sincerely and with full clarity of purpose -- on behalf of not merely myself, but of all good and righteous persons whom witnessed this unholiest of debacles: cease and desist, now and forever! Do so immediately -- if not sooner. For if such is not accomplished, I fear greatly for the future not only of all good persons, but the future of the Cinema itself! Alas! It may be too late already -- because those pitiable souls who suffered the boredom and the pain of the wretched awfulness have already paid the ultimate price -- and likely shall not be the same ever again!I, however, shall do my humble part to stop the madness: I will promise, in all truest candor -- from this day forward to the end of mine humble days -- to keep this dear prayer closest to mine heart: that none so wretched, none so foolish, and none such wasteful and awfully- written folly should ever spring forth upon this good Earth to desecrate the Cinemas, and blacken the hearts of Men!But whether such madness is again perpetrated, and whether the suffering shall continue, this I say this from the bottom of my most broken and tormented soul: I hate thee truly, madly and deeply, singularly and solely, and dare I say for all eternity -- or perhaps even longer.Amen.",The Village

I watched it as a film (not a puzzle or Horror), I had not read anything on the film other than a few basic reviews in magazines and I may have seen a trailer at the time of release and nothing in between.I must say if you do not watch it solely for the twists, it is a thoughtful and interesting movie. I actually guessed the first twist prior to watching the film and the second twist a half hour in, but this did not spoil a well told tale and I must say a big improvement on the terrible ""Signs"" which was the only Shyamalan movie up to ""The Village"" I really did not like at all !There is a great foreboding atmosphere created and some excellent performances by a quality cast, I have to say that I thought Bryce Dallas Howard gave the standout performance of the film especially considering it was her first major role.Please give this film a chance and watch with an open mind and no expectations and you should enjoy this delightful tale.",The Village
289,watchtiger1,Barely watchable,1,9 July 2010,"After this movie was released Mr. Shyamalan should not have been allowed to may any more films.Very predictable, implausible with how you are introduced at the start of this move you are supposed to be in the 1800's as the movie progresses you learn of events in the people's lives that made them want to get away from society and start this colony. Which if are to be believed are events that none of these people would speak of outside family for the era of the 1800's. So how they learned of each other is a mystery even after you find out it's not really set in the 1800's. Once you learn this fact it is just something to watch because you are enjoying your popcorn that you made or paid for at the theater.During the movie a villager becomes ill and a doctor in the village says they need antibiotics to help the villager. The woods are inhabited by a mystical evil man eating creature. You learn later is nothing more then a villager in a costume that has a mental issue.An older girl played by the daughter of Ron Howard, is the one that says she will get the antibiotics. She is given a note to give to the person at the ""ranger station"", wait Ranger station. Wait did I type ranger station,this is supposed to be the 1800s. I didn't know ranger stations even now keep a prescription medicine cabinet in the office let alone then. She is stalked by the villager disguised monster, whom she alludes and later kills though not at her own hand. She gets to the outer edge of this village beyond the woods she encounters a sign indicating it is the ""Private Nature Preserve"" of the family of one of the village elders.

I was on the edge of my seat the entire 100 mins and couldn't have asked for more. Shymalan has pulled out all the stops on this one. His direction was deliberate and objectifying, and really hits its mark.
If you haven't heard much about it, then don't let anyone tell you what awaits you. Don't let them ruin it for you. Watch it for your self and enjoy it for what it is, a super supernatural thrill ride of a very high caliber. This is what movie making is all about!",The Village
291,Scorching,Not the best but it's up there,7,20 January 2005,"Just like any film from director M.

I got to say that despite what a lot of people said I actually liked the twist of the movie. I definitely think that this was better than the one they had in Unbreakable and perhaps Signs. I was pretty shocked when they revealed the true nature pf the Village.Another great aspect I felt was the performance of Bryce Howard, daughter of acclaimed director Ron. She seemed to be very comfortable with her role and seemed to fly through her role as a blind woman. I especially liked her performance towards the end of the film. I guess the fact that she was trained on a stage acting where there are no take twos unlike the world of cinema.I guess one of my main disappointments with the film because I though the movie would take a more supernatural approach as seen in the trailer. Yes there were few parts that had thus but generally it was more of a drama. Plus they had a love story placed in as a major theme which made it even bizarre.",The Village
292,soymilk,"A decent story, just badly told",5,16 February 2005,"I suppose it would seem like jumping on the anti-Shyamalan bandwagon if I started by asserting just how thin his whole 'chilling tale with a major twist at the end' routine is wearing. Either way, I'm going to have to agree. It's wearing incredibly thin, so much so that even 'the Village' seems to exhibit signs of self-awareness that whatever shocking big surprise Shyamalan may have up his sleeve on this occasion is all his viewers really came here to see. By now, a twist's to be expected with his films, so that novelty's pretty much done with, and 'the Village' doesn't even try to kid us on that one. It knows full well that we know full well that it's working it's way up to a surprise of some form or other, and tries, unsuccessfully, to stay one step ahead of us by using our expectations to its advantage. And trusting that self-conscious instinct is the single worst mistake this movie makes - its top priority soon becomes to keep on reversing our assumptions as much as possible over whatever form this particular bombshell will take, at the expense of just about everything else needed to bring it together as a movie. All 'the Village' really does is present us with a scenario and suggest so many different possibilities that the whole thing soon spirals into more of an elaborate guessing game than anything else - the story and rather insipid cast of characters are little more than ciphers to this scenario, and it almost willingly sacrifices its chances of being taken seriously as a film very early on in the run.I don't know about everyone else, but the moment I personally stopped taking 'the Village' seriously was when they suddenly decided to break the eerie tension and give us glimpse of one these things that the villagers themselves 'do not speak of'. Up until then, the ways in which it built up angst in the earlier scenes could actually be very absorbing (also terribly clichéd at times too - red is the 'bad colour'? sigh...). So long as the threatening forces go unseen, we have no idea what the villagers are really dealing with any more than they seemingly do. We share their uncertainty, are kept in the dark as much as they are, which gives us a deeper connection with the characters and makes it all the more effective. Then when one of these monsters actually loams into view, with the villagers all fleeing in terror from it, I honestly couldn't bring myself to view it as anything more than a man dressed up in a silly costume. And, low and behold - a little later on in the film we discover that it really is, in fact, a man dressed up in a silly costume, but by that point the potential chills were long since dead, and the revelation came more as whimsical irony than anything too shocking.It's from then on that the pacing becomes tiring and off-putting, the diversions feel forced and the screenplay's attempts to frighten us, in context with everything else, seem strangely awkward. To be fair, I didn't actually manage to guess the final revelation, no matter how obvious everyone else tells me it was, so it still came as quite a pleasant little surprise, but the previous 100 minutes or so's worth of build-up was far too lightweight for it to have any proper punch. Characterisation is second banana to these plot devices, which doesn't help things - the residents of this village are generally bland and underdeveloped, and only detract from whatever rewatch-ability value the film might have had. It's particularly strange that the script never really attempts to explain why Noah, the mentally backward kid, should turn into such a malevolent rebel - they just seem to assume that his drooling, laughing at inappropriate moments and stereotypically bad social skills will be explanation enough, which it isn't.The irony is, through such a vicious onslaught of flaws, 'the Village' does glow with potential, and I have a feeling that if he wasn't so caught up in trying to surprise us and gave those merits a little more elbow-room, Shyamalan might finally have had something on his hands to have rivalled 'the Sixth Sense'. The direction itself shows a lot of flair and promise, the basic storyline is haunting, quirky and intriguing enough to hold the viewer's attention throughout, and, above everything, it does manage to touch upon some potentially very powerful moral issues regarding human nature. As the narrative questions, just how much of our innocence have we really lost in our modern times, when things like hatred and violence have existed all throughout history? This just cries out to be the true focus of the movie and, if it were so, then 'the Village' might have ended up with a lot more depth and meaning than the end result. Too bad then that Shyamalan isn't nearly as interested in the social implications of his film as he is in playing that damned game of 'Guess the Twist Ending'.Grade: C",The Village

Most things I have read have given brutal ratings but the word of mouth I have heard from the few friends who saw it was positive.

This isn't a true horror flick, and it doesn't have a whopping climax that I'm sure everyone is desperate to see. Instead, we have an accurate portrayal of colonial living and some supposed supernatural influences. I have heard complaints about the acting: I thought it was superb. I have heard complaints about the pace and mood: I thought it was appropriate. I enjoyed the love story, the ending, the people, and most of all the directors' careful camera angles. I won't recommend it though, because I can see why people would hate it - if you're going to the movies to be shocked or surprised you probably won't be.

298,shattenjager777,Shyamalan's New Voice,6,31 July 2004,"Much of the charm and success of Shyamalan's last three films (""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs) was that he used a very realistic directoral style and a limited number of well-developed characters in a supernatural framework rather than designing a typical ghost story, superhero story, or alien story.  I find it incredibly interesting to see this and that was why I wanted to see ""The Village.""  I honestly hated ""The Sixth Sense,"" absolutely loved ""Unbreakable"" and only somewhat liked ""Signs;"" so I was probably the only person there who would call myself a Shyamalan fan and say I was hoping it wouldn't be ""The Sixth Sense.""And it wasn't.  In fact, it was hardly Shyamalan.  While it did retain his films' beautiful look and still wasn't overly formalistic, ""The Village"" shows a much more formalistic bent than Shyamalan has shown before, employing much more camera manipulation than Shyamalan's last films had.  It was also different because the number of characters was greater (which is ironic, since ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" both take place in the metropolis of Philadelphia and even ""Signs"" is in a less isolated location) and their depth lesser.  The other elements that defined it from the other Shyamalan hits was that the story before the ending was full of twists where the others saved up their only twist for the end (""Signs"" excepted) and it did not have a twist at the end as all of the others did--which to me was a welcome sign of Shyamalan's narrative growth.The acting in the film was very uneven, highlighted by excellent performances by Adrien Brody as Noah Percy and Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius Hunt.  *SPOILERS AHEAD*  While for the most part Phoenix is not given much emotion to show, it is amazing to note the ferocious, intense look his face gets whenever Ivy is in danger--give him about five years and I'm sure Phoenix will have a well-deserved Oscar under his belt.  *SPOILERS OVER* Adrien Brody meanwhile also gave an excellent performance, giving his character a sympathetic quality that a lesser actor could easily not have given us.  Despite the actions of Noah Percy, I could not help but feel sorry for him when we saw his face--Brody is the youngest best actor winner in Oscar history for a reason, after all.  Meanwhile, Bryce Dallas Howard was awful as Ivy Walker.  While sometimes she had a lack of emotion that could be explained away by her blindness, at other times she did not keep the emotional lack in check, which made her unbelievable.  In small roles, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver were also weak and difficult to believe.Shyamalan's script's major flaw was its forced dialogue.  There was no reason for these people to talk this way and it was obviously unnatural for the actors except for Adrien Brody, who did not have the type of ultra-formal, unflowing, ugly dialogue that the others did--instead his was often rather unintelligible, which was sensible.  Perhaps Shyamalan was just attempting to pull us deeper into this world, but I found it very distracting.  The characters also lack the depth of those in his previous films, but are still not terrible.  The plot was actually quite good--probably the second-best Shyamalan has come up with (only to ""Unbreakable"") and had a few unforseen twists along the way.In summary, ""The Village"" either marks a new direction for Shyamalan's career--aiming in a more plot-driven way as a writer and leaning in a more formalistic direction as a director--or an anomaly that we will look back on in 20 years and say, ""That was M. Night Shyamalan?""  It doesn't feel or seem quite like a Shyamalan film, but it still has some strengths--a good plot, excellent performances by Adrien Brody and Joaquin Phoenix, and general scenic beauty--and those strengths outweigh its weaknesses sufficiently to make a satisfying film overall.  It may not be what Shyamalan's fans want to see, but non-Shyamalan fans may want to give it a try.",The Village
299,TIALI,It's a Cookbook!,5,31 July 2004,"C'mon, you know twenty minutes in what the big twist is going to be or you're at least entertaining the thought...but that's not the point when it comes to enjoying this movie.  There are also several small surprises that are worth waiting for, but there are also a few idiotic moments that destroy the charm and the suspensful momentum.  M. Night Shyamalan has produced better writing, but he still has the talent to create multi-dimensional characters whose motivations are honest. So even if someone spills the surprise and tells you, ""Vader is Luke's father,"" it shouldn't ruin your enjoyment.  This is not a great movie, but it offers a few great moments.",The Village
300,katydid4819,Shyamalan's Glory Days Are Over,5,8 August 2004,"Unlike his previous films, M. Knights Shyamalan's The Village is more Hollywood expectations than decent, original filmmaking. With The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs Shyamalan toyed with strange scenarios, experimental lighting and a powerful sense of honest suspense. In The Village all these elements still exist but they are overshadowed by the weak ending and stiff characterizations that keep you from being completely drawn into the film. Color has played a big role in Night's films and here it does again. Red is the bad color (The Sixth Sense, anyone?) and it is countered by yellow. The people of the village wear the strange shade of mustard hoping to protect them from whatever it is that they are so afraid of. The red things, I guess.  They live in a village that is completely set apart from any time period. Though the tombstone in the beginning says 1800, the grave is surrounded by barbed wire and the presence of plastic is not scarce. These people idealize innocence and perhaps in trying to capture this, the script abandoned plot development for this more free feeling. As the village idiot chases a blind girl through a field, the audience is still trying to figure out how any of this is relevant. It's not until more than half way through the film that there is more going on then burying the `bad color'.The Village wants to be a film that the actors carry. If the casting had gone better then maybe the whole movie would have been salvaged. But as it is the story is just not strong enough to overcome it's own faults and the poor performances of it's actors. Ron Howard's daughter (Bryce Dallas Howard) plays the blind girl, Ivy. I didn't know she was blind until someone said so. When she speaks to someone, she looks them in the eye, when she walks it's exactly where she wants to go and she's not clumsy in the awkward way she should be. Apparently Ivy has the ability to see people by the specific color they each have. This is so ridiculous it can only be explained by the fact that they had to give her something because she couldn't pull off playing someone who's blind. Oh, a quick side note about Bryce Dallas Howard: It's funny that her hair is red. That should have been a sign not to cast her. Adrien Brody, coming fresh off his Oscar win, gives the best performance of the film. It's not a hard character. He plays the slightly retarded Noah Percy. It's the usual bag of tricks: dopey eyes, laughing, clapping. See Sean Penn in I Am Sam for a better take on this type of person.There is nothing exciting about The Village. In all fairness, it doesn't deserve the trashing it has received from critics but Shyamalan disappoints here and for him, this kind of let down will hurt twice as hard. I suppose it is true that all thing that go up must come down but Night had a long way to fall and I have to say I hope he hit the bottom. Another Village and Shyamalan could be said as a flash in the pan with The Sixth Sense. Nothing can ever top that and if you can't go up, there's nowhere but down. I suppose The Village was doomed from the day `I see dead people' was penned. **1/2 out of *****",The Village
301,KillerCadugen,"Not what I expected, but quite good",8,3 August 2004,"The trailer made The Village appear as if it would be a chilling horror movie with hideous monsters lurking in the woods ready to rend limb from limb any villagers stupid enough to enter but - SPOILERS AHEAD - we are thrown a curve ball and the movie is not what we expected. That, in itself, may be the reason why some people are giving this movie such bad reviews (some critics give it a B- and others an F ... which is why I never listen to what critics say). There is a Village - supposedly a 19th century village - which has settled in a valley that borders a wood that purportedly contains creatures ... ""Those We Do Not Speak Of."" There is a truce that the creatures or the villagers do not cross the barrier between them. But someone has and the creatures begin terrorizing the villagers. The elements of the movie, right there, are chilling but it is when one villager decides she needs to cross the woods to get to the towns on the other side that the movie takes a twist and we find out what the real secret of the Village is. I was waiting for the twist that M. Night has become known for and when it was revealed, I admit I went, ""Huh?"" But upon further reflection with my wife, I admit that I loved it. I found it to be an exceptional movie, but my only complaint is that it should not have been touted so heavily as an out-and-out horror movie. I gave it an 8 out of 10.",The Village
302,baba44713,a very underrated movie,9,9 November 2004,"I like clever movies, and I like scary movies. And because of my disposition I already spent money on two very awful movies that came from Hollywood this year: abysmal ""Godsend"" and at first glance promising but ultimately stupid and disappointing ""The Forgotten"".That's why I proceeded with care to the latest Shyamalan's work: ""The village"". The trailer looked promising: a desolate turn-of-the-last-century village, sorrounded by the forest in which some horrible creatures live. Promising, but being careful lately, I first checked around the net...and was amazed to see a big load of negative reviews. Roger Ebert for instance, whose opinion I usually respect, gave it a horribly low grade! Great.Nevertheless, I chose to see it, and I must say was quite pleasantly surprised. Here, ladies and gentlemen, you have a very nicely shot, atmospheric thriller with great cast, good story and a few finishing touches of Shyamalan's cleverness (which could be simply called brilliant when compared with the latest scripts that the Hollywood vomits over its audience!).Why the lousy reviews? Well, there are basically two kinds of people that will want to see this movie: first the horror fans, who will expect a gruesome and chilling and potentially bloody tale, and the puzzle-movie fans, who are more or less not interested in the movie itself, but in ""solving the latest Shyamalan's puzzle"" of what the movie is all about.The horror crowd will be disappointed. There are scares in this movie, but way too much characterization and drama for their taste. As for the other crowd, well people, the twist is there, but this time it's very guessable (although Shyamalan still has some tricks up his sleeve, as you'll see).It seems that Shyamalan will always live in the shadow of his masterpiece ""The 6th sense"". People still remember getting their socks knocked off with its powerful ending, and keep expecting that to happen again with every following movie. What's worse, Hollywood realized that the twists are trendy, so lately we have lots of movies with a final twist, most of which are stupid/cheap/illogical. People today set their expectations too damn high, especially if they see Shyamalan's name at the movie poster.This movie is great. The atmosphere is great, the cast is fantastic, and what I mostly love about it, it's clever. It's logical. And whatever you say about it, it's CONSISTENT. Compared to the other Hollywood crap we are getting served lately, this is a VERY good movie.Watch this, but not as a puzzle, but as a great movie in itself.Well, just my 2 cents.",The Village
303,kylopod,Shyamalan's most under-appreciated film,8,19 August 2006,"I don't think I've ever been more shocked by how much I liked a film. I had very low expectations when I decided to watch ""The Village,"" because I knew how much critics had panned it. I'm not saying that I regard the consensus of the critics as sacrosanct. But the movies I love are rarely ones that have earned critical scorn, so by the law of probability I doubted that this one would be any good. Besides, I had noticed a steadily downward slope in the quality of M. Night Shyamalan's films since ""The Sixth Sense."" When ""The Village"" was released and subsequently panned, it seemed to fit the pattern that I myself had noticed. So I didn't go and see the film. Only recently did I take a look at it on cable, more out of curiosity than anything else.And alas, I found the first fifteen minutes rather slow. The movie has a lot of characters, and it doesn't quickly establish which ones are the most important. All we see is this primitive nineteenth-century village in the midst of woods that the villagers believe to be haunted by ominous, sentient creatures who will not harm the people as long as they don't set foot in the woods. The villagers have all sorts of rituals to protect themselves from attack, such as avoiding the color red (what is it with Shyamalan and red?) and wearing yellow hoods. But rules are meant to be broken, and a quiet, mysterious young man played by Joaquin Phoenix wants to journey into the woods so that he can visit ""the towns"" on the other side, which boast superior medicine. Among other things, he wonders if he'll find a cure for his mentally handicapped friend (Adrien Brody). In the meantime, he's falling in love with the blind girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) whose role in the plot will expand as the movie progresses.The love story between Phoenix and Howard is well-handled and believable, transcending the romantic clichés. The two characters seem to possess a common understanding and don't have to talk much in order for us to feel the developing bond between them. But what they do say to each other is intriguing. My favorite line is ""Sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them."" Their personalities also transcend stereotype, particularly with Phoenix: while stoic and courageous, he's also shy and withdrawn, as revealed in scenes where he passes letters to the public council instead of speaking in front of them. His ultimate significance to the story turns the heroic convention on its head.Everyone in the village speaks in an oddly formal manner, using big words and avoiding contractions. The accents are American, but the diction is like that of a nineteenth-century English novel. Amazingly, the actors make this language sound natural as it rolls off their tongues. The cast includes several familiar faces: William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, and the aforementioned Phoenix and Brody. But the star of the film is the as-yet unknown Howard, who delivers a performance so compelling that it's a shame the film was trashed by critics.Much of the film concerns the relationships of the characters in the village, but the mystery of the creatures also dominates the plot. This is more of a quietly creepy ""Twilight Zone""-style tale than outright horror. Like Shyamalan's other films, it ultimately carries a message of hope and optimism. But Shyamalan does not forget his horror roots. No other Hollywood filmmaker today is better at crafting scenes where a character is being haunted by an evil presence. These scenes work because of Shyamalan's acute sense of how nightmares feel. Like all skilled horror directors, he knows not to focus on the monster itself but on the panicked reaction of the character being stalked.While the use of a blind character is hardly a new device, Shyamalan handles the scenes with Howard in an interesting way. Instead of the usual approach of teasing the audience by showing exactly what the blind character doesn't see, he practically makes us blind along with her. He has the camera follow her as she walks, so that we don't see what's in front of her. We soon realize that we are seeing little more than what she is able to discern about her surroundings. In crucial scenes, we are effectively almost as much in the dark as she is.I cannot say much more about the plot without ruining the movie's surprises, which are abundant. Critics dismissed ""The Village"" as a crude exercise in plot manipulation. I couldn't disagree more. While I'm not certain that the logistics of the plot work in every detail, most of the criticisms I have heard reflect a superficial reading of the story.The film has the same basic structure that Shyamalan always uses, where we are swept up in the events and only at the end do we find out what the movie was truly about. From there, we have to think backwards to understand the ultimate meaning of the story. I have seen the movie three times now, noticing new things each time. The social themes make me think that Shyamalan is familiar with Joseph Campbell's works on primitive societies and the origin of drama. The back story is very well thought out compared to that of the average thriller, and I feel some disappointment that more people aren't able to appreciate it. The beauty and genius of this film is a well-kept secret.",The Village
304,spencejoshua-22736,Initial disappointment gives way to intrigue.,8,12 October 2020,"I fully understand how many were disappointed with the execution of this film. After viewing it I initially felt the same way. My annoyance was centered around the direction that the film took with the creatures. Learning that they were farce was a big ""let down"" for me personally. Fortunately, the film continued on a path that over time began to replace my disappointment with intrigue. Anytime that a story makes one feel like there's a need for another viewing is a win on the director's part. So, even though I was sad that the film wasn't what I wanted it to be, which was a battle between villagers and creatures in the forest, I watched it a few more times to fully appreciate the effort.What makes The Village a good film?1. - THE SETTING: It pulls the viewer into a setting that is unique within itself. As soon as the film begins, the viewer is curious to what time period, nation, culture or medium(fact/fiction) in which this story is taking place. The brilliance of this is that we soon forget its importance due to the developing plot, and then later its significance returns at the end of the film as a dynamic plot twist! This isn't a new tactic but the film stays within the boundaries of realism unlike many of the other films that use this twist. This strategy is more common in Sci-fi, mindbenders, dream sequences, hallucination banter, imaginary pieces and horror that defies all reason. This film does not fit into any of these categories.2. - THE TONE: The film has a continuous looming of dread throughout with very few ""happy moments."" I believe that this helps create the sense that the village is controlled by fear. It's interesting that the fear that has been created by the careful planning and execution of the elders that not a single character is driven by a private narcissistic desire. We see a group of individuals that share a common bond and determine not to sway from their oaths. With that being said, the characters are very similar and don't attract much attention by the viewers. In other words, they're simplistic. This is typically a no-no, but the presence of ""the ones we don't speak of"" had our full attention, so it actually worked. When the creatures turned out to be farce, I thought ""Oh no, a blind girl and a mentally challenged dude have taken center stage."" and even though there's nothing wrong with that it didn't fit into my expectations! Still, the tone was kept intact and felt very smothering and oppressive to the viewer. At no time is it lifted and with the standing vote of the elders in the end, they determined to continue the farce of fear. It is somewhat disturbing to think that Ivy and others will be responsible for carrying out the lie that has kept the village in check. We must also remember that this film does not actually have any ""real"" monsters in it except for the criminals in the towns that pushed the elders to take such drastic measures for the safety of those they love. Even Noah can't be hated but pitied by the viewers as there was no true malice in him.3.- THE ARTISTRY: The overall use of a simplistic set, music, lighting, colors, props, etc. to create the story was very artistic. Thankfully, the creators didn't take it too far as many films do. It is pleasant on the eyes with drops of symbolism throughout, but not overkill. I believe most would agree that the cinematography was fantastic and the images stick in the mind. Excellent camera work and the acting was good to great! The image of Adrian Brody in the pit wearing the monster costume..........that was an excellent shot! That single shot makes this film score at least FIVE STARS....In conclusion, I gave it EIGHT STARS, and consider it one that I could watch again and again. It really seems like something that gets better the more you view it. Watch it 2-3 times and see if you agree.",The Village
305,cornflakeboy20,high school play,3,15 March 2005,"I'd expect higher production values of a summer blockbuster styled movie. Everything from the costuming to the sets to the dreadful monster costumes could easily have come from - and fit the budget of - a typical high school production. Literally, there is nothing in this movie that could not be easily replicated on a stage, especially if you had a trapdoor.As for the actual plot, it's like a slumber party scare. Although I didn't know the ending before I saw the movie, I figured it out the instant I saw a secretive tribe of elders meeting.This movie is really meant to be a morality play. It's meant to pose a question about utopias and whether we should retreat from the modern world, and furthermore how do we keep out the influence of the modern world after that retreat. Some people criticized Signs as a religious themed morality play instead of a sci-fi movie; I'm wondering if this movie is arguing for atheism instead of religion. It shows how religion and superstition keep people in line and keep people from wandering off the path, like the expression that religion is the opiate of the masses.At any rate, whether you're actually looking for a morality play or whether you're seduced by the false belief that this is a thrill a minute horror movie, it is to be assiduously avoided.",The Village
306,PeterHerrmann,My takeaway on this .....,8,8 July 2021,"... is perhaps a message (several, actually - but related) that other viewers don't see (or maybe they do and perhaps it's obvious); namely, in life there are lots of potentially frightening things, but it is at times necessary to take risks, and sometimes the ones who take the risks are not the people who you think might. And sometimes the result of courage can be astounding. Or, perhaps that was not the intended message, and I missed it. Notwithstanding the movie's message, it seemed to take too long to develop; was plodding much of the way through.",The Village

308,vocklabruck,Not what I expected but it was OK,4,4 November 2006,"I just gave this movie a chance because of his director. I had seen The Sixth Sense like other people and wanted to see more by him.The Village was boring to me. It wants to be suspenseful at times but it did not thrill me at all. The ""twist"" or however you want to call what M. Night Shyamalan usually makes in his movies, is VERY predictable this time, so I think the movie loses a lot of energy for that reason. Have you ever think to leave a film without a twist once in a while?The good part of this movie is Adrien Brody which labor was EXCELLENT and also the farm scenery/wardrobe is superb! The music was unique. I loved it! That violin at the end is so beautiful that made me go in tears! So my points are not really for the film, but for Adrien Brody, the clothes, the scenery and the music.What I need to object again is that M. Night Shyamalan's whim of appearing as an actor. Man, you are not Martin Scorsese! It seems you are always thinking ""Where can I put my face?"" By the way, Bryce Dallas Howard is OK but not to portray a blind girl. She moves her eyes in many moments during the film. In fact, it took me some time to realize she was blind because she didn't seem so!",The Village
309,Jose Guilherme,The ideas behind the story make this movie great...,8,5 September 2004,"** Spoilers in some places **After reading dozens of post complaining that it wasn't scary, wasn't a horror movie as the trailer, wasn't hard to figure out the ending I feel I have to add another comment.I saw only half the trailer and I was half way to figuring out it was some kind of social control twist in the end. I do agree that Night didn't do a great job either hiding the main plot idea or giving enough tension at moments. The end twist wasn't that innovative or surprising. The actors were above average and the direction quite good in my opinion.Now to those ideas ""behind"" the movie plot. I really enjoyed the movie due to the mental and intellectual implications: These are nice and likable people scaring their kids into submission and compliance by faking monsters. That is more ""horror"" than werewolves in the woods. That they let people die without ""medicines"" in order to keep the farce is strong. Their dismay at the thought of it all ending too. Is our modern society so dangerous and scary ?In order for society to work and to be united fear must be ever present. Raise the ""red alert"" when Lucius gets a bit too curious. The ""terrorism"" as a distraction and means of control. Elders plotting secretly for the ""good"" of all. How fear kills curiosity, dissent or even questioning of the status quo. Even if one disregards the 9/11 parallels. In order to be innocent the children have to be kept scared of the outsiders. Remember the ""bogeyman"" and other childish stories ? Isolationism as a means of ""purity"" and a new start. The puritan way of life that brought the English pilgrims to the new world. The ideas about society vs the individual are endless.Like another comment mentioned, red first appears in a beautiful flower. Its promptly plucked and buried. Red is passion, violence, blood, nature and our animal side. The villagers have little passion and live serenely. Ivy's sister is over romantic but in a hollow and fairytale way, no real passion. To be innocent must we give up our passions, greed, curiosity and liberty ?Finally we must remember that for much of history people actually lived like those villagers. In awe and fear of the supernatural that lived just after the torches and fire. The woods dark and forbidding. People disappearing and not coming back. Wolves prowling the night. The sounds of the forest haunting our primitive ancestors into building frail societies for self protection. Thank god our modern lives aren't based on fear... or not ?I recommend this film... I like the way Night builds up suspense and avoids cheap frights. Naturally some might not enjoy it as much. 8/10",The Village
310,scarecrowman,He's a genius and critics are busy praising crap like Training Day and Gladiator.,9,17 January 2005,"I have become a great fan of M Knight over the years. Of his four films since the Sixth Sense and including it he has stunned me with his imagery and his ability to make a film ultimately look and feel real. His staple plot twists are what has made him a box office success, but ultimately you cannot watch a Knight film without feeling like you have been somewhere. The Village (to me his best film to date) is not exception.While one of the two major plot twists in this film can be seen from miles away, this does not take anything away from the film. In fact all the while why you think you have figured out the twist you are ignoring the other hints that lead to the final twist. I think Knight knew this all along and sacrificed one for the protection of the other, to me that is genius. However, I think it is ignorant if not just plain ridiculous to critique any film on it's plot twist and whether or not you can figure it out before the film maker reveals it. The Usual Suspects is still a great film almost a decade after finding out who Keyser Soze really was. The Sixth Sense was a great film and I figured out Bruce Willis' secret before it was ever revealed in the film. Let's not forget that Hollywood is the reason why we look for plot twists in every film. Knight did not overkill the ""plot twist"", nor did Brian Singer, and nor did O'Henry. The fact that in the last seven or so years at least thirty percent of the films released had plot twists from Basic to Taking Lives to Fight Club to Secret Window to In The Cut, it has been one plot twist after another. Don't blame Knight, blame Hollywood.The Village looks wonderful, and has a very fairy tale esquire feel that even Tim Burton couldn't pull off with double the budget. The is superb all around, and there is a feeling of freedom and innocence throughout the film, something few films do these days. There isn't any sex, language, and the violence is extremely mild. Knight creates his atmosphere with great set designs, amazing sounds, and superb acting. As a film in full this is a wonderful film not to be forgotten. Knight to me is the Steven Spielberg of this generation a man with a unlimited imagination, who reads people with the camera, and who is not afraid to tell a tale without gimmicks like nudity, sex, language, and violence. In this day and age where movies like Fast and The Furious dominate the box office with sex, sleaze, stupid unbelievable stunts, ridiculous Tarrentino challenges language, dumb plots, and horrible acting Knight should be a breath of fresh air to both critics and to movie fans.I for one can't wait for the next one from M Knight.Nine out of ten crows fed as an offering to Those We Don't Speak Of.",The Village

The story line was very creative. I actually watched it twice within two days, once on my own and once with my wife to get her reaction. Lots of twists, somewhat predictable ending, because clues were given throughout the film. Howard's portrayal of a blind person was a bit thin, I had trouble resolving some of the physical acts she performed.

Now, i'm not claiming that he ripped me off. I never wrote anything down, nor did i speak of it to many people. It was an idea. And many people have common ideas. This just shows that i think on the same level as a former thrill-master (Sixth Sense was a great thriller, no matter what any of you think), and i take that as a compliment to my creativity.But putting that aside, i saw it coming. Totally and utterly saw it coming. As soon as they revealed that the monsters were fake. That just made it all too aparant that the villiage was fake too. Had Shymalan left that minor twist out, the end twist would have been even more surprising. But he just made it too obvious, and that is the downfall of this film.Finally, i give it a 7/10.

What I got was a complete borefest of the slowest developing movie I've seen in years. I spent most of the movie wanting to yell at the characters to DO SOMETHING. This is horror? The so-called ""monster"" is seen twice and does nothing thrilling or scary.Was ANYONE surprised by the horrible excuse for a twist ending? I think it came as no surprise to anyone who had ever seen a movie before. I saw it coming, my girlfriend saw it coming and my brother saw it coming. I think this Shyamalan guy wants so badly to think of himself as some master of fooling the audience that he forgets to make an interesting story to go with his twist ending. The characters stand around talking and talking and never get anything done.The talking scenes were too long. We got the picture as to what they were getting at, but yet the scenes continued on for no reason. It was like using a fire extinguisher on a fire that had already burned itself out.What a lame movie monster as well. It looked like one of the creatures from The Dark Crystal. I was startled twice, more by the screeching music that accompanied the sudden movement than anything -- once when the monster is spotted from the watchtower and once when the blind girl falls into the pit.Luscious was a boring character who did nothing. Noah was probably the only thing worth watching due to his comical moments. He's the only thing that originally kept me from giving this movie a 1.

It is done to keep the villagers' way of life alive, to protect their culture.I didn't watch this movie in the cinema where it was perfectly quiet or on DVD where I could read subtitles, but instead I watched it on TV, so sometimes it was difficult to hear the actors talk. In most if not all Shyamalan films, characters tend to talk very quietly, often whispering. This I don't think is a problem if there is enough silence in the room.This is not a horror movie like House of Wax where we are served endless blood, gore, and homicides, all delivered with sudden music swells during moments of silence to shock the audience. I thought the mood was creepy and throughout the film there was a mild feeling of anxiety, but no masked killer will appear from nowhere to make you jump in your seat and there will be no over-the-top torture scenes to make you cringe like in Hostel.One member of IMDb, bartond57, gave what I believe is a very good commentary on the film: ""I felt is was a story about the power of myth, and how far people will go, even for good reasons, to perpetuate their myth. Innocence is a topic as well. How does one keep people innocent and trusting in a evil, sinful, world. And how far should someone go to 'protect' one's innocence? I grew up in a conservative religious subculture. This movie speaks to that experience. In the end, the decision by the elders was to continue their myth, regardless of the circumstances. I found this disappointing, but how true is it today with many religions? Religion can be a good thing, but it is always a struggle to know how much 'innocence' should be protected. How sheltered should we be? But even in the movie, the evil they were trying to run from (murders) took place in their own edenic setting. In other words, we can't run away from human nature. It is part of the human condition."" I feel the same way. The movie says a lot about how much of a role deception plays in keeping communities together. It reminds me of what Plato said about the Noble Lie, how the survival of a population relies on grand myths. People need to believe in ideas greater and more significant than their own individual selves or else they will descend into nihilism, which leads to chaos and a breakdown of society. These ideas are still popular in modern times with people like Strauss and even today's politicians like Wolfowitz.",The Village
318,schmimic,"Another movie from Shyamalan. It's not bad, but not on par with the rest.",8,23 April 2005,"Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrian Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver This is M. Night Shyamalan's fourth movie now. I loved his first three movies to pieces, and I walked into this one with high hopes. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.The movie is set in the late 1800s in a small village that is cut off from the rest of the world. The inhabitants are not to venture off into the woods or ever go near the woods, because that is where ""Those we do not speak of"" live. Those we do not speak of are creatures that the people of the village have a truce with. They leave each other alone and exist apart from each other without disturbing each other. In the village, they hide the colour red for they believe that this colour will upset or anger those they do not speak of.But then strange things start happening. Those they do not speak of enter the village one night and leave red marks on everybody's doors. A few days later, many animals are slaughtered and skinned and the bodies are left all over the village grounds. Many people believe that they should leave the village, but the elders decide that they can still salvage the situation and hopefully patch things up with their ""friends."" But then a tragedy occurs in the village. One of the young men, Lucius, (Phoenix) who makes his intentions to marry one of the young women (Howard) known is stabbed by a jealous individual (Brody). The only way that Lucius can be saved is if somebody leaves the village, goes back to the towns, and gets proper medication. Otherwise, he will die in a matter of days.The girl he was planning on marrying, Ivy, who is blind, volunteers to go to the town to get the medicine for her fiancé in hopes of saving him. The elders object to this course of action, or at least they would if her father didn't let her go without telling the rest of the elders. He lets her in on a few secrets but doesn't let her know too much. Just enough to help her get to the town, get the supplies, and get back.As in all of Shyamalan's movies, there's a twist. But this one is a little more predictable than the other ones. I saw it coming a ways off, and I found this movie to actually be pretty boring. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. Overall, it had a pretty mediocre feeling to me.Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth watching)",The Village

Shutter Island
The Sixth Sense
The VisitThis is one of these movies that is really hard to review without spoiling anything, so it won't be long. It's a yet another mystery thriller by M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense; The Visit; Split; Glass). It's about a closed Village in the middle of the woods that has a set of strange rules to live by: don't wear red and don't ever go out to the woods...This was my second re-watch, and I've only now realized that this films has pretty bad revies across all platforms and among both critics and audiences; which was surprising to me considering it gave me everything I have expected it to be: a mystery film with a plot twist. The cast was terrific: Adrian Brody, Sigourney Weaver, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Joaquin Phoenix (playing an unstable character again, it's just his thing); both of the guys later got an Oscar each for other films. I really liked the story as well, just like basically every Shyamalan script. I feel like the bad reviews (that are firstly old, back from 2005 when the film came out) mainly come from false expectations of this being marketed as a horror film. Expect a mystery, and you'll be in for a treat. Expect an action horror, and you'll be disappointed.",The Village

Night seems to have a talent for trying to put a film out that makes no sense but has a ""deeper meaning"".The two just don't go together. It is a shame he put out Sixth Sense as that has caused me to see two of the worst movies ever made. This being one of them and Signs being the other.People can't cope with the ""bad"" modern world so they return to innocence by creating a web of deceit and lies, going so far as to develop full ritualistic behaviors to instill a deep an mortal terror in their children. This IS the bad side of modern life, the desire to force others to adopt what you think is the ""right"" way and not allow them choice.These miscreants set up an entire Village with which to ensure their terrorized children don't ever have to experience evil. Oh yeah, that makes sense. And don't get me started on these deeply scarred people, people scarred by the deaths of loved ones, dealing so stoically with death and destruction in their new heaven.Horrible, and I would even go so far as to say anyone that can see deep meaning without the conflict IS the ""bad"" side of modern life and should be avoided as readily as this clunker.",The Village

323,giomanombre,One of the best films I ever watched...,10,3 February 2005,"I think this director has true skill, a well crafted movie. Basically a medieval romance is made out of a 'Mennonite' community who makes a sheltered utopian society and create a 19th century community. In order to protect this community - creatures are invented to scare the people from venturing out. The beginning of the movie draws you into the characters and attempts to bring you into their world. As other posts have suggested, it is like a Twilight Zone flick, or an ""Outer Limits' episode on film.The medieval elements of romantic literature are all there, mythical creatures, magic potions, wooded forests, costumes, love triangles, and I think the director has done remarkably well taking a Twilight Zone movie and climaxing it with a romantic twist - like a Medivil romantic folk tale.I rate his movie highly because it has kept my attention straight from beginning to end. At the start, you know about the community, and you are drawn into the fable of the mythical creatures, and you are in suspense to find out who they are, and what their role is going to be on the movie. The love triangle and romantic elements start playing out on the movie - and love wins in the end.The theme of being in the 'woods' is something that is also present in another movie: 'the house of flying daggers', where love triangles, and a conflict of characters involving romance is occurring in a wooded forest.",The Village

The speach William Hurt (one of my favorites) gave to convince the elders he had to risk everything ""for the right and knoble cause"" just gets me every time. These people created a harmonious community in hopes to remove everything horrible in the world and create a sanctuary.I often look at the amish and think how womderful it was. Just a community that lives for eachother and they do so without all the technology that is supposed to make are lives easier. In reality we have every horrible thing happening in the world piped right to our brain.So in summation, its a beautiful movie, from a world far less complex than modern day society.",The Village

The monster is a guy in a suit played by one of the elders to keep the villagers to scared to leave the place and go to the town referred to as a evil place full of vice. Well done sets and costumes place the village at the beginnings of early America, surprised to say when a SUV pulls up to help her get medicine for her boyfriend is a little but depressing. the monster being a guy in a suit is depressing, the fact that the village is in the middle of a game preserve owned by Hurt with a private security force to keep the 20th century out if depressing, it was good movie that keep me on edge but the ending was so cheesy that I was truly laughing . This would have been a great movie but like with Idenity (a J Cusak film) the ending kills the entire story. The acting in the movie including the sexual tension between Hurt and Weaver and over all make it a good movie to see just the last 10-15 min of the film are bad.

326,vfrickey,"Shymalan swings, he hits, he... puts one in left field.",7,3 March 2005,"M. Night Shymalan is making a name for himself not only as an auteur in the psychological thriller genre but as a moralist. So my ""7"" score is partly due to the fact that ""The Village"" fails to live up to its hype, or to the rest of Shymalan's work, for that matter. Of course, Shymalan is a money maker these days, so the producers probably felt pressured by the money men to make us see ""Village"" commercials in our sleep prior to release.The problem with the media blitz, of course, is that almost NO movie can live up to a full-on 21st century movie ad campaign. The nice sense of schadenfreude when something like ""The Day After Tomorrow"" goes flat can be satisfying, but it should never happen to one of Shymalan's films.""The Village"" just plods along most of the time. I've spent a lot of time in woodland clearings at night, because a lot of my relatives lived in the woods or close to the woods or between the bayou and the marsh on a levee, and he captured that ambiance very well... but I didn't feel as though the movie was going much of anywhere until halfway through it, because the pace just lagged.The pace of the film does pick up about halfway through the film, which is good because I was about to duck out for a lined notepad and pencil to start writing the foreshadowing down so I'd remember it in the second half of the film - or out for a nice meal, something.And that's as close as I'm going to get to spoiling the film, except to say that the Shymalan twists at the end of the film were predictable - unlike ""Signs,"" which starts off making you sure you're watching a psychological thriller despite the spooky 50's sci-fi setup, then makes you sure that everyone in the house, especially the Mel Gibson character, is a head case - and the next day, guess what - you're in a modern science-fiction movie which then morphs into a play all about faith... and there you are leaving finger indentations in your hardwood coffee table or the plastic armrests of your theater seat.""The Village"" is, unfortunately, nowhere near as unpredictable as ""Signs."" The final, chilling plot twist occurred to me a third of the way through the film, and halfway through, I was certain of it. And I was right. Ditto with the second-to-last chilling plot twist.I can't decide whether it's the actors' fault or Shymalan's that the characters all seemed to have gotten into a private stash of quaaludes before every scene until halfway through the film (of course, William Hurt acts like that all the time, so was it type casting in his case?) I mean, I was appropriately moved when I should have been, but not moved in the way I'd come to expect of Shymalan's work. It's just not fair being M. Night Shymalan, you know? Reviewing a thriller is difficult - unless you're sadistic enough to want to spoil everyone's pleasure in the film in question. And that would be a shame for this one.",The Village
327,theguys1,not exactly what I would call a breakthrough,1,2 August 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan, writer/director of ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", and ""Unbreakable"" has come up with an idea in 2004 called ""The Village"". I felt I really wanted to see this movie when I first saw the coming attractions for it, but personally, as more and more bad reviews about this movie showed up on IMDb, I was a little unsure about this motion picture. I expected this movie to be about an endangered village located in Pennsylvania, and when I entered the theater for it, I expected a chilling, spine-tingling frightening movie. But what I got was a bag of green slop. I expected there to be a meaning in this movie, as all the others of Shyamalan's movies are. But I must say, I was a little impressed with the story, but the special effects were absolutely despicable. The monster looked like he was made out of plastic; I've had dry hands that looked scarier than that. I have to admit that a few parts made me jump, but during others, I was laying in the seat, ready to fall asleep. Normally, in all Shyamalan's movies, there is a surprise ending that shakes your spine, but in this movie, there was a quote from one of the characters, and then ""An M. Night Shyamalan Film"" showed up on the screen. I haven't seen so much disappointment in a movie in my whole entire life.

This way the village is cut off from civilization. Perhaps 'TWDSO' like it that way? I've seen this twice. The first time I saw it felt cheated. This was not the film the marketing machine from Touchstone pitched to me. This was not a horror film. I felt so bad about the fact they lied, that I didn't pay attention to the film. Not until the second viewing. Than it became clear.This is essentially a love story. A story about hope and actually trying to make the world a better place. Shyamalan's script is intelligent and he loves his characters. He gives them the best dialogue I've heard in film for a long time. Yes, he does pull my leg (just like the marketing machine) but the funny thing is that the film is really honest. Especially in the final act. There will still be people who'll hate this.

332,RandomTask-AP,Old Fears Can Still Frighten,8,31 July 2004,"Kids find things and places that scare them, and dare each other to press the limits. Dive off the high board. Walk the rickety bridge. Go into the abandoned house after sunset. Most people are born with a natural fear of the unknown, and face those fears in different ways. Until any fear is broken, people's limits are contained within them. The inhabitants of `The Village' have an extra dose of fear from the elusive creatures that offer them sanctuary if they stay in the limited domain of their woodland Pennsylvanian town. From that set-up, M. Night Syamalan's makes his latest film create frightening monster chills without ever resorting to slasher-film gore. The movie opens with the funeral of a child. Other than the deceased being young, there is nothing suspicious about the event, and it clearly establishes the facts of life in late 19th century rural Pennsylvania. Sounds that come from the woods surrounding the town bring looks of fear and haunted pauses in conversation about `Those We Do Not Speak Of'. To make certain that the truce to keep the worlds of the woods and village separate, watch towers and torches are a long-standing part of town life. The people of the town talk about the creatures in the most reserved of ways as life goes on. The elders (two of whom are played by William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver) help keep everything running as the young people fall in love and direct people to care for the mentally disabled Noah (Adrian Brody). Although it is Tabitha Walker (Jayne Atkinson) who declares the strength of her love for Lucius (Joaqin Phoenix), it is her blind sister, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who captures his attention. The appearance of skinned animals along the border renews people's worries about the creatures, and the night they come into town leaves everyone quivering in storm cellars as the clawed and porcupine-quilled creatures pound on doors in apparent anger. Although Lucius presses the elders for permission to cross the woods to find new medicine and aids for town life, it is Ivy who must ultimately face the unknowns of the forest when misfortune befalls Lucius. What lies in and beyond the woods is what the townsfolk truly fear, and what Shyamalan has come to challenge the audience with.There is currently no worthier heir to Hitchcock than Shyamalan. Right down to the cameo appearance, he follows the Master of Suspense's tradition in toying with the audience's expectations and primal urges to create unique experiences within his movies. He also leaves plenty of clues to the film's secrets out in the open for those who are observant enough and who keep and open mind. Not every big name associated with the picture has a pivotal moment to play up, and it works to the benefit of the movie. The A-list heavies who are here have come to be a part of a story, and not to simply give easily anticipated one-liners. Roger Deakins continues his fine career of cinematography working to reveal only what is necessary. His images are beautiful, but also use light to increase the sense of a limited world. Things are never starkly sunny, and a haze is maintained over everything. The pre-dawn conversation between Lucius and Ivy is a scene of quiet intensity created by the symmetry of their subtly highlighted faces. Only at night are the shadows sharp and crisp by torchlight. The score is a Hollywood one to be certain, but it too is not overdone. And to achieve that, James Newton Howard pairs down the music to meet the size of the situation. When the music helps a scare, it only reinforces the moment. The music alone doesn't make you jump, your anticipation does.Many Hollywood films approach the idea of horror with the intent of pure shock. They know that the audience has come expecting a particular kind of monster. Market research demands starting the scares early and bringing them often at the sacrifice of any real character beyond `jock', `nerd', `virgin' or `creep'. While `The Village' is largely accepted as a horror movie, it makes an attempt to challenge the notions of fear and courage while it scares. It is more of a drama with monsters than a traditional monster movie. This is more about the experience than the goal. Everyone went in droves to see kids get lost in the woods of `The Blair Witch Project' not because kids getting lost in the woods is an unusual occurrence, but because it was a film that successfully generated fear in the way campfire stories used to. Shyamalan is a storyteller who makes movies, and that is all he has set out to do here: tell a scary story, and do it intelligently.A friend of mine who saw the film with me is betting on a dominating opening weekend with a massive drop-off in box office on the second weekend because the surprise at the end of the film doesn't mesh with exactly what audiences expect. M. Night Shyamalan will probably never again attain the hushed shock that swept over people at the end of `The Sixth Sense', which was a monumental achievement. He shouldn't need to repeat the exact feat with every one of his movies. He may be weaning us off of the need to be shocked in the same way with each progressive movie. There are plenty of people already revealing the secret of the ending on message boards and chat rooms. The object of fear once it is revealed, much like an object of desire once it is attained, is never as great as what it appeared to be from a distance. The revealed truth, in fact, is cause for sadness. That does not make the challenge any less nor does it diminish the heroism of the people who faced the limits of what they thought they could do. The final fright is, could anyone in the audience have been any braver?8 out of 10",The Village

One main reason was its ""twist"". As we know, M. Night has been known for his twist endings. Unfortunately, this film almost became a gimmick for the twist. It actually was sort of in the middle, if you count the revelation, which kind of makes the rest of the film play out less intense than it should have.Overall, this film should have been advertised as more of a drama than a thriller.

337,paul_tremblay,Metaphor of a culture of fear...,6,20 May 2005,"The year, 2004, how to create a lie, an alternate reality? One of the deleted scenes (from the DVD) includes a drill in which Walker (William Hurt) rings the alarm bell and everyone scatter back to their houses and hid underground. In the finished product, there is such a scene (not a drill) where a creature intrudes in the village and the same bell has everybody running to the basement. The scene is reminiscent of a 40s or 50s government drill (remember the black and white clips in which children jump under school desks and entire families gather into anti-nuclear shelters?) Another deleted scene has Noah's father his family about the murder of his brothers, blaming it on the creatures, then claims that this is not to frighten them, just to ""inform you"".The theatrical version had already enough information for us to conclude that there is a negative nudge towards, not only the 50s, but also the present White House administration: the creation of fear, of an enemy, the blaming of another (the other) for your own mistakes, the elaboration of a propaganda campaign in order to submit a population to your agenda. Isn't't the forbidden color, red, is also reminiscent of communism.The Village then reveals us that it was all a farce, a hoax created to keep the good citizens of the place into both ignorance and seclusion.Two points here: One, the deleted scenes make the movie even more subversive, so I assume they have been discarded for a political reason. Secondly, how not to see the symbol of storytelling and ""true story"" as manipulative techniques of persuasion, to ""inform"" with lies. Actually, Walker says of Noah's death the ""he made our story real."" You do not need reality to make a story, just a credible series of facts that you connect accordingly with a made-up context. Remind you of anybody lately?In a more aesthetic level, is the movie at the level of what you should expect of the director of The Sixth Sense? No, the ""revelations"" to Walker's daughter are laughable and anti-climatic at best. But it is unfair to compare with such an ingenious work of art. Recommended.",The Village

I saw the trailers and I was hopeful that the master of the ""twist and trick end"" would not ride that trick pony to death but would instead make a serious horror or...serious something film.This film would have made my ""thing"" (less than one rated) category of super losers except there were a few moments that made me begin to hope that what was very soon painfully obvious was not true. I should have known better for if a little common sense and logic were applied to what was not a trend but just blind (pardon the pun) hope of something ...even a slightly useful something might yet appear.It didn't need to be great but just worthy of the my 20 bucks.But friends this just doesn't and didn't do it. There were kids in the theater who laughed and booed at a few scenes and I was inclined to join them but I didn't.  So rather than beat a dead horse or a tired trick ending to death allow me to make this short.  If you pay real money for this you will not be a happy camper. M. Night should get a grip on his monumental ego and try to make a real movie...He is a darling right now and he can get the bucks and the folks to act.  The problem is the lame story and he bares the blame for that; then second, is the lame directing and he...well you know the drill here too.  Skip this one!  I wish I had done so!",The Village
341,asiduodiego,"Quite effective, but flawed.",6,8 February 2019,"The Village is a drama masquerading as a horror/suspense movie. The premise is simple: A village in mid XVIII century is being terrorized by supernatural agents that surround the village...(spoilers)... except that, of course not. At this time, we all know the drill. The whole thing really is set in modern times, when a group of people used some incredible contrived means to isolate themselves completely from the outside world. Indeed, it sound really forced, and somewhat ridiculous.But, I think reducing the whole thing at a bad twist is making a disservice to the movie. When I watched The Village, the movie felt less like a horror movie, and more like a love and human drama. The relationship between Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix is really well crafted in the movie, and it feels real, and even beautiful. When tragedy struck in the middle of the movie, I was worried less about the whole monster schtick, and more about the plight of the characters. Those were the moments that really carried the movie.But alas, here comes the flaw of the movie. Being this an M. Night Shyamalan movie in midst 2000s, the movie couldn't just be a drama: it needed a ""suspense"" and ""horror"" theme, which is the weakest angle of the movie, and completely ruined by the ""reveal"" I mentioned, which makes everything regarding that angle, completely pointless. It's the same flaw that ""Signs"" has: a contrived and unbelievable plot device that belittles and ruins all the suspense.But, I think this movie is superior to Signs, because although The Village plays with the suspense angle, it's far less accentuated than in Signs. I think the same resolution could have been kept, but making the movie less about the ""mystery of the monsters"" and more about the personal drama. I think the movie works in the end, but this flaw severly damages it.6/10",The Village

343,SomaQuest,Shyamalan's Best Film,7,5 October 2018,"Forget for a moment what you know about Shyamalan's tendency to ""twist"" each movie, this has been done by directors for years, and look at this film in it's entirety and you will see how well put together it is.Although billed as a ""horror"" movie this film is not one in any aspect. The Village is a study in psychology, sociology, family, grief, love and the endless possibilities opened up when people put themselves toward a common goal. In all reality I would categorize this as a romance film. This film, which is underrated and over-criticized by the vast populous, is a brilliant piece of social commentary on many levels. True, some of the acting was overdone, and some foreshadowing was forced and arbitrary, but if you view it as a whole with no preconceptions of reviews you have seen, you will not be disappointed.",The Village
344,DrMMGilchrist,"Thomas Hardy visits 'Sleepy Hollow': a moving, disturbing fable, revealing real monsters...",10,8 December 2004,"'The Village' is not the 'scary monster movie' some reviewers wanted it to be. It is a subtle mood-piece, a Hardyesque rustic love-tragedy, a heroic quest, and a fable exploring the use of fear and deceit as tools for social control and manipulation. The 'twists' are, more accurately, keys to the mysteries and apparent anomalies. What is truly disturbing is the conclusion: a chilling 'happy ending' which raises serious moral questions. The first scene, the funeral of a child, Daniel Nicholson, tells us it is 1897. Covington is an isolated Pennsylvanian village with its own rituals and customs. It is some sort of pacifist commune run by a council of Elders, reminiscent of the Amish, Mennonites and Shakers, or - given the prominence of women - of 19C progressive experiments such as Brook Farm. But the idyll is precarious: in the surrounding forest there are mysterious Creatures which the villagers placate with animal sacrifices and other rituals. Everyone has to stay within the village bounds; the colour red is forbidden, while yellow offers protection. When the truce between the Creatures and the villagers is broken, livestock are found skinned and doors are marked with red. Against this 'Little House in Sleepy Hollow' folksy/Gothic background, a touching romance develops between shy, hard-working Lucius Hunt and Ivy Walker, a lively and indomitable blind girl. There are complications: Ivy's sister Kitty sets her cap at Lucius; Lucius has to overcome his own emotional reticence; and Noah Percy, a waif-like, mentally handicapped youth has a crush on Ivy. It's Thomas Hardy territory: the spirited young heroine; the quiet, stalwart hero; the rival marked for tragedy. (Imagine Giles Winterbourne or Gabriel Oak competing with Abel Whittle for a visually-impaired Elizabeth-Jane!) ****Spoiler**** This triangle provokes crisis. Seemingly the last to know of Ivy and Lucius's engagement, Noah - distraught, at the mercy of emotions he cannot articulate - stabs Lucius. His wounds become infected, and his only hope is for someone to cross the boundary, to brave the woods and the Creatures, and bring medicine from 'The Towns' beyond. 'The Towns' are forbidden territory, regarded as evil, violent, corrupting. We have already begun to learn that Covington village was founded by people fleeing 'The Towns': the Elders (including the parents of the young protagonists) had all lost family members, and sought to build a peaceful life. They are oath-bound never to return. Earlier, after the death of Daniel Nicholson, Lucius had himself contemplated making the dangerous journey for medical supplies, to prevent other children dying. Now it is Ivy, determined to save her beloved, who sets out on the quest. Her blindness is regarded as an advantage, in that she will not see, and thus not be tempted, by the world beyond the wood - if she can complete the journey. We are now in the world of folktale: the valiant young girl travelling through the forest in her hooded cape (in this case yellow!), to bring back potions for her lover. But on the way there are several important revelations for us and for Ivy. We learn more of the Elders: of the society which they have fled, and that which they have created. We discover the true nature of the Creatures which manipulate and intimidate the villagers. And when Ivy does reach help, we see what she cannot - what really lies beyond the woods. Bryce Dallas Howard is splendid as Ivy, a strong-willed and endearing young heroine. Adrien Brody is heartbreaking as the desperately vulnerable Noah: despite the harm he causes (which rebounds on himself), this viewer ended up clinging to a slender thread of hope on his behalf. I was less certain of Joaquin Phoenix's Lucius. He's likable enough, and I was certainly rooting for him to pull through, but 'strong and silent' can veer dangerously close to 'inexpressive and wooden': Joaquin is generally better in more demonstrative roles. Perhaps he and Adrien should have swapped roles? Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt, as Alice Hunt and Edward Walker, sensitively convey a tentative relationship, within the constraints of late 19C rural puritanism (he is married). Brendan Gleeson is also good as the bereaved Nicholson. Both music and photography are superbly atmospheric. Like most fairytale quests, Ivy's is a success. But to describe the ending as 'happy' would be misleading. It is *disturbing*. The Elders, especially Ivy's father, are still determined to cling to their deceptions. The most frightening moment in the film comes when Walker asks a couple to allow their child's (presumed) death to be co-opted to reinforce the community myth. The real monsters are in the village itself, not the forest: still-traumatised, manipulative adults, who claim to be acting for the good of others - to the cost of the most vulnerable. Some have interpreted the film as a parable about the US government's use of terror-threats to create a climate of fear in the present, or about its own nationalist mythology. It may also allude to affluent 'white flight' and gated communities (the all-white composition of the village is, I suspect, deliberate). But the deeper themes are international, generically human. Organised religions have used myth and legend as instruments of intimidation and social repression. Yes, urban life is sometimes insecure and haunted by fear of crime, but is a retreat into a simple rural life the answer? Nostalgia for an 'innocent' past can be dangerous (children killed or handicapped by treatable illnesses). But perhaps there is hope for the future, when courage and love such as Ivy's can prevail.",The Village
345,bubsy-3,A John Steinbeck Novel in Verse,10,13 January 2005,"I have to say upfront that I LOVED this movie and I didn't expect to. But it is different from any other movie I've ever seen and different from this director's other films.The Village feels like a John Steinbeck novel (think Of Mice and Men) presented in the style of an opera (without music) with dialogue presented in verse . Actually, I would love the thought of a modern composer making an opera out of this movie.The DVD notes compare this movie to Hitchcock. I have no idea why. This movie is very spiritual. It is about feeling, emotion, human suffering and human experience. It is about emotional pain and the attempt to free one from pain.I've read some comments that compare The Village to the Truman Show. I really don't think there is a comparison. The difference is that The Truman show is affected by an external situation while the Village is internal.The Village is a wonderful movie.",The Village

But IMDb exists for frank postings, and I was so displeased with this movie that, forgive me film-makers, I really wanted to let off some steam.The script was the core problem for me, it was so uninvolving, so slow at the start, and so absurd at the end. A first rate group of actors did bring life to their roles, but The Sixth Sense this is not (but then I thought Signs was not very good, ruined by an awful second half).Ms. Howard was excellent in the only good role, while Adrien Brody sure has talent. But even for a mere 99 cents on Pay Per View I was ready to call this misfire off after sixty very long minutes. Poor Mr. Shyamalan may be getting budgets, and pretty good grosses, but he is seeming more like a one trick pony with every film. 2/10",The Village
347,MatBrewster,Only Watch It Once,7,21 April 2005,"The problem with most thrillers is that once you've watched them one time, there is nothing left. Too many of these films spend all of their creative energy trying to give the audience a scare. The best directors of the genre create truly great films, which just happened to give the audience a scare. While M. Night Shyamalan is an excellent craftsman, he tends to be unable to elevate his films into the realms of true cinema. The Village is no exception.The story centers around a small village that seems to be set in the later part of the 1800's. The Villagers have worked out a complicated deal with strange creatures (""Those We Do Not Speak Of"") lurking in the near woods. Problems arise and the long held pact begins to break down. This causes there to be a need for one of the villagers to venture through the woods into the larger towns.The biggest problem with the Village and the last several of Shyamalan's films is his surprise endings. I read somewhere several years ago that he didn't want to be pigeonholed into doing the same supernatural type stories with twist ending. I wish he had kept to his word. Instead everyone goes into the theatre expecting, waiting on the surprise at the end. This is a distraction taken away from the whole of the film; it is a gimmick that has run thin. A truly surprising ending for the director now, would be no surprise at all.Where Shyamalan excels is his Hitchcockian use of suspense. He understands that some of the best thrills come not from something jumping straight out at the audience, but in what we don't see. It is a long time in the Village before we see ""The Things We Don't Speak Of"" and even then we only catch a glimpse. For Shyamalan understands that our imaginations are more powerful than any piece of costuming or CG effect. There were, in fact, several moments during my first viewing of the film that hand my hair standing on end. These were tense, beautifully paced moments.The film also creates a masterful sense of mood. The color scheme, set design and costuming are all top notch. They give the film a true sense of paranoia and suspense. The acting, for the most part, is quite good. Which is not surprising considering the cast is made up of the likes of William Hurt, Sigorney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrian Brody amongst others. There several interweaving human stories set amongst the supernatural tale, some of which are quite moving. Yet it is the supernatural aspect that shines brightest, and ultimately, falls flat upon subsequent viewings. Watching the film a second time, knowing the surprises, I felt a tinge of boredom. The story no longer captivated me as it did the first time. Knowing the truth, there were too many plot points, and character actions that seemed false, or self serving.It is a film worth a first viewing. Shyalaman is a true talent, and I look forward to his next film. In a sense the Village is really two stories. One is a suspenseful tale of creatures lurking in the dark, and the other of a quaint village dealing with extraordinary circumstances. I believe the fault lies with the merging of the two. The suspense doesn't hold up under subsequent viewings. It does not serve the other aspect of its story. Likewise, the more human story is broken apart too much by the mystical aspects.Like this review? Go to www.midnitcafe.blogspot.com for more.",The Village
348,gravity3,"Still a Smart Movie, but We're Smarter Now",6,5 August 2004,"Most of us have seen director / writer M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE, and many have seen his other  widely released films. I've even seen his earlier gem, WIDE AWAKE. And I like everything I've seen. Let me re-state that, I love everything I've seen, until now. Everything in THE VILLAGE looked great, the actors were all in good form, and it even gives us something to think about. But I have to admit, this is his weakest effort. The problem, however, is not the movie we're seeing, but when we're seeing it.Mr. Shyamalan has taught his audience well. Ever since SIXTH SENSE, we've learned that when watching one of his films, any minute now (and certainly by the last few minutes), things will be turned on their head and some kind of clever plot twist will be revealed. Sometimes it's more subtle than others, and requires a little more focus, but it's always been there. And it's in THE VILLAGE as well (though I wouldn't give it away if you paid me real money - and shame on those who have).M. Night has affectively created his own problem, by making us smart to his plot trickery over the years. The bar is raised and he raised it. If THE VILLAGE had come out right after - or before - SENSE, I think we'd all be raving about it. But it's not 1999, and we've had quite a few twists and surprises from the director. Now we're prepared, we're looking, expecting it. We've learned his style, maybe some of us know it as well as he does. And that's really the issue.I think M. Night has done a great job of writing suspense stories, and in learning his style many of us have also learned to spot his hints. We go in focused and alert, with our thinking caps on so to speak, because we know it's not Explosion Movie Part 6. I believe it's this reason that left me with fewer surprises and less satisfaction walking out of the theater. The story - and again it's a good one - had me looking constantly for clues, and then just waiting for the confirmation of my suspicions; that's a lot less fun than what we all got at the end of SIXTH SENSE. All my whining aside, there are much, much worse films to see and I was still pleasantly entertained. I hope everyone still has fun seeing it, and it's still a smart film - he hasn't sunken to dumbing things down as yet. But I also hope Mr. Shyamalan clues into his own smart audience and figures out how to write a story that makes us think we're going where he usually goes, then doesn't. That's the one I'd like to see next, but that would be a big challenge for any writer. I do think he's up to that challenge, but time will tell. Until then, THE VILLAGE is still good (maybe great for some other director), but really not up to the M. Night standard. That bar, in my book, sits pretty high.",The Village
349,LeathermanCraig,Hmmm... didja miss the point?!?,9,16 August 2004,"OK...  we've all read some of these comments for the latest of M. Night Shyamalan's films....  Seems that people either love it or loathe it... Many offer up reasons that we should do either option - leaving no middle ground....My advice?  Drop all expectations and notions at the door.  Go into this movie without all the hype or hatred this film has garnered.As for many comments posted around:* * * POSSIBLE SPOILERS INVOLVED * * *So what if the plot twist was easy to see for some....  I knew it in 20 minutes and found a few supporting items along the way.... the doctor's glasses, a line of dialogue about a sister being raped and murdered in an alley 3 blocks from home, certain other aspects of the dialogue...... Just go in like an innocent child and decide for yourself.M. Night may very well be attempting to be the next Hitchcock, and he's got a lot of his characteristics down - making suspense thrillers, appearing in small cameos, etc....  He is NOT trying to make horror films, any more than Hitchcock was...  they're into the suspense...  letting the plot and the actions 'scare' you...  Expecting a horror monster movie - go see 'AvP'.As for the dialogue sounding 'flat' to some - remember, this is a 20th/21st century 'scholar' (he's a teacher, remember?) and his concept of what the language would be....  And, recall, that many of these people were 20th/21st century people....  So, they can only ASSUME what the verbage and words would be....To the ones that bring out about how everything looks fresh and new and yet you assume that the 'Village' has been around for at least a generation... Get real!  Given the 'twist', and how most of the items are only about 30 years old, it makes perfect sense that the items would not be threadbare and ruined....  And, if you need proof of the timeline, look again at the picture of the 'elders' outside the counseling center...  That is a decidedly mid/late 70's Ford in the foreground....  I'm a car buff, so I knew THAT one right away....  Also, given the potential money that the Walker family had, it is completely plausible to have many of these items made and in as-new condition.  But, again, if you were paying attention to the details, you'd have caught it...  One look at the glass of the buildings and the plates in the opening feast scene show you that they're made with modern technologies and NOT from the late 1800s....  So, you either chalk them up to 'continuity errors' or you think about them....  See above for other examples (doctor's glasses, for example....)This movie was made to make you THINK.  It was NOT meant to be a late summer BLOCKBUSTER of a film....  That's not what M. Night is all about....  He's far more subtle than that....MY OPINION - and it is just that MY opinion:The movie is very good....  it has a slow point or two, but enough suspense to keep the audience engrossed...  Yeah, there are a few plot issues (holes?) that can seem jarring, but many CAN be explained by the twist.  Not M. Night's BEST film, but not his worst, either....  And he's got a lot of years left ahead of him....One final thing to ponder - the 'sounds' of the creatures in the woods.... Do you think that they could the the sounds of the sirens from the ranger trucks or from some trains passing in the distance?  I grew up in the Pennsylvania farmlands outside of Philly...  And a train that is 10 - 20 miles away could sound very much the same....",The Village
350,DonutLover,"Too big a Clue, Too Soon, but liked it anyway.",6,25 February 2007,"I liked The Village. But, I have to say that I encountered a logistical problem, about five minutes into the movie. It was when the village folk sat down to their long tables, for their meal, or feast. They had some vague ""blessing"". There was no mention of their God, in an exact form, ie. ""Lord"", ""Jesus Christ"", ""Jehovah"", whatever. And, they were all dressed like Amish, so that lead one to believe that these were religious folk. Well, religious folk from long ago, had a specific God, and still do (Amish). They have some kind of semi-formal ritual, or custom, at the table, not just some California free for all approach. So, the question that came to me was: would this director be so negligent as to think that some liberal ""universal force"" would pass as religion to his audience? Of people dressed like this? I suspected that M. Night was a pretty smart guy, so NO he would not try to pull that off with his audience, as it would be too lame and obvious. So, then, that lead me to think: if the director is not trying to pull that off, and he WANTS us to see that these folk are DRESSED like pilgrims, but are actually NOT pilgrims (and I did assume it was earth), then that means that these folks are not who they are pretending to be, and I bet that this is modern day. It was as obvious as some banana sitting there with ""Dole"" marked on it.Then, I was proved right. And, I was disappointed because I had figured out a main clue of the movie, and it was because of something simple thing like that. I think the movie was marketed all wrong. So early in the movie, when the ""truth"" is revealed, that it is modern day and it's all a scheme to fool the kids, I felt the audience, collectively, sigh in disappointment. Too bad!! Because a) the story was cool, and b) the scenery was beautiful! and c) the characters were great, and J. Phoenix is very sexy, and the love story was good. I liked the movie overall, but the marketing of it, as some horror movie, destroyed it for many people. The Sixth Sense is one of my favorite films, and I also loved ""Unbreakable"", and ""Signs""! This movie would have been good, if it had been marketed as a drama, not a scary movie. It did have it's scary parts! And the monsters were very cool. It also had me thinking that, these people had a bit of balls. I mean, to leave society and lie to your children, BIG time. All for the sake of making a better world for yourself, and your children. If these people had that kind of chutzpah, couldn't they have done something a little bit more reasonable, such as some vigilante thing, in their old world? Maybe killed the killers, or banded together to build some urban trap, to kill murderers and child molesters and rapists? Why did they just give up, and 86 their world? I liked the premise of the movie, though. And, I liked how the wife of William Hurt, reminds him very strongly of his oath, stressing ""oath"", actually reminding him of his oath to something more than just the village. It's a fun movie, and I recommend it.",The Village

""The Village"", like ""Unbreakable"" & ""Signs"" is yet another outstanding achievment, and I would recommend it to anyone that has mental stimulation during the day and at least a small dosage of intelligence.  What american audiences fail to realize about M. Night's work is that it isn't about plot twists,or scaring you out of the theater.

Like most, probably all, of M. Night's movies, he has an ability to use film to convey metaphors and truths that most of us either take for granted or have forgotten.  ""Signs,"" for example, was about the loss and gain of Faith. ""Unbreakable,""  on face value, was about the truth of good versus evil and the legend of a superman/messiah; more importantly, though, it was about ""self image"" and how an accurate or distorted one can shape who you will be.I believe that most of the bad reviews about ""The Village"" are written by those who missed the forest for all of the trees.  This movie has a simple theme...that one should maintain hope and love in the face of adversity and evil; that love will conquer all.  All this may seem stupid but I bet if you re-watch some of these movies with these themes in mind, you will see them in a new light.I highly recommend this movie.

353,Cicman69,"A good movie, but very over rated",6,9 August 2004,"Here we have a seemingly picturesque nineteenth century village in rural Pennsylvania. But of course, things are not as they seem.
Possible spoilers after this point.I won't comment on the ""surprise ending"" which was no surprise to me since I guessed it half-way through the movie. What I really want to know is why did these elders who founded the colony think living in a nineteenth century village would make the perfect utopia? What's wrong with electricity? Or modern clothes? Or indoor plumbing? Why use mid 19th century speech patterns? Do any of these things have any real intrinsic value in regards to a society? I don't think so. I know the whole idea was a retreat to innocence. But I fail to see why living in a relatively primitive society would enhance innocence. Sure, you may have simplified your life on the surface, but in ANY society with two or more human beings, there WILL complications. Mankind can't exist in a state of pure innocence. It's simply human nature. And to delude yourself that living a Amish-like existence will heal all your wounds is very sad. You can't run from your pain. You deal with it. But these elders did no such thing. They ran from their problems and founded a doomed utoptia. And of course all utopias are doomed from the start. Of course I also realize that the use of the 19th century by the writers was simply to throw the viewer off for the ""surprise"" ending.
Now in regards to the love story, I felt this was tastefully and realistically done. Normally I don't like hollywood love stories because they are so trite..ie ""Titantic"", but not so here.

As a comment on our current 'post 9/11' fear of the outside world and the enemy at our gates, I thought the film intelligent and thought provoking. The acting and cinematography I found of a high standard (the cast were for me excellent) and the portrayal of a community isolated from the world and the general spooky and unsettling atmosphere I found haunting and very memorable.

The movie was really good, but then when you realize that it is fake (well duh, the movie is fake, but I mean it is fake in the movie. It would be cool if the animals were real in the movie, not in real life) then whole atmosphere of the movie being cool just leaves the building. Probably won't ever watch this movie again unless I have nothing else to watch, but I honestly would rather read a book then watch this movie",The Village
358,Kellyann-1,Excellent movie. Phoenix&Howard shine,10,4 August 2004,"The Village is an excellent movie. Those who want another Sixth Sense or a horror movie maybe disappointed but it is still a great movie. My only complaint would be that I wanted to see more of Lucius and also more of his relationship with Ivy.The Village is a wonderful and intelligent story with thrills,romance and characters you care about, especially the characters of Ivy and Lucius. Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard give stellar, standout performances and have phenomenal chemistry together. Judy Greer, Adrian Brody and Cherry Jones give great supporting performances. I give The Village a rating of 10. It is a great film.",The Village
359,alexandrajade,Absolutely horrible,3,12 October 2004,"I'm a big Shyamalan fan. ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs"" are all fine films, provided you watch them exactly once. But this work is subpar at best and horrible at worst.For starters, ""those we do not speak of"" were too much about words and too little about actual suspense in this film. They were referred to practically every minute and showed up, what, two times? This is not to say the village should have been under constant attack, but it made it seem as though there was no enemy. Children play, people get married, it's all very ho hum except for the town gathering and climactic scenes.Brody's portrayal of the mentally challenged character is passable. I do like how he is tied in to the main story thread at the end. Phoenix also is passable. His portrayal is fine, there's just not much there. It really feels like Night threw this script together quickly.But there are signs (pardon the pun) of what is to come all throughout this film. It makes the big ""twist ending"" a colossal letdown. And to those who savor this movie for its ""artful exploration of the human mind"" and whatever, that's fine for about 1% of the population. Frankly, I would like that AND some suspense, which Shyamalan has shown he can give us. He just didn't do it here.3/10 (I'm not gonna lie, it's because of Bryce Dallas Howard that this film even got 3 from me)",The Village

362,rust37,An Anthem to Minimalism,9,30 December 2004,"What I suspected from MNS starting from his Unbreakable appeared clear in Village - he is interested in developing as a drama director. I will not be surprised if one day he decides to screen Shakespeare. If you are a pure horror movies fan either quit seeing MNS' movies or start seeing other aspects in them. Another suspicion, which became obvious in Village is his strive for minimalism. Not in the way Lars von Trier does (handheld shooting, no props) but in terms of playing and the picture. Remember the Sixth Sense booming of each scary scene and rewind to the most dramatic episode with the knife in Village when there is no sound at all. Remember the limited set of colours in Village, shooting unnecessary heroes from a distance, etc. This is the most minimalistic movie I've seen from mainstream Hollywood in years.The movie does not lampoon GW Bush administration as it could appear from many comments. At wider scope the issues raised in the Village equally concern e.g. Hitler and Stalin, elections in Ukraine, etc. Bad colours, somebody we do not speak of, etc. The novelty of the Village is that in contrary to his latter movies (e.g. childhood problems, family relations, etc.) MNS now took even more difficult philosophical aspects to explore (place of individual in community, manipulation of masses, etc.). Respect.The only reservation I keep is the minimalism in playing, which I agree to be somewhat numb. The most of actors are little underused. Better use of simple human emotions imho wouldn't spoil the minimalistic set. The script, picture, camera-work, soundtrack (which is a masterpiece), proper use of sound/visual effects, and philosophical background make the Village deserve 9/10",The Village
363,cosmicfish14,A Decent Movie With A Terrible Ending,5,26 August 2015,"Sorry if this review took a while to come out, just been busy with school.Anyways we continue on with Shyamalan Month as we go onto his 4th film, The Village. Now this isn't the point in his career where I felt like he went into complete insanity (thats for next time), but this isn't his high point either. But lets get started on this.First lets start out with the positives. I feel like from a technical stand point it actually isn't all that bad. The cinematography is nice, some the acting is good, it has cool scenery, it has an AMAZING score,and is generally good. Its mostly with the story that the movie falls apart.While the story isn't as bad as Shyamalan's later movies, it still has a lot of problems with it. I won't really go into much detail, mostly because most of the problems are technically spoilers, but I will talk about the acting. Some of the acting is actually not that bad like Adrien Brody's character and Joaquin did pretty good, but some of the others actors seemed really bored and uninterested, also some of the dialogue was pretty hokey.Anyways the movie was just alright in my mind. I probably would have liked it more if there was better acting and a more well structured story.Also, for those who have seen the movie, you are probably wondering what I think of the ending. Well here are my thoughts:https://40.media.tumblr.com/cb5ec065dc2ae5ffd0f5b9d53440f312/tumblr_ inline_nt3jtin9Jt1rximkx_540.jpgThat is all.Final Score: 5/10",The Village

365,loveballet12,It's just okay,6,26 May 2012,"Date: 12 May -First Time Watched- With 'Signs' being one of my favorite movies of all time, I had some high expectations for The Village, mostly because it was directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars Joaquin Phoenix, one of my favorite actors. Unfortunately, the movie did not deliver and I firmly believe it was this movie that showed that unless Mr. Shyamalan has a good solid script, it's not going to be as good as 'Signs'. The characters weren't really believable and after awhile I got bothered with Ivy, the main character, and her peppy attitude towards everything. Personally, I would have lost my mind around her. In short, this movie was just okay and not fantastic.6/10",The Village
366,shes_dead,the most boring film you will ever see,1,4 September 2004,"I went to watch this at the cinema with my girlfriend, and when the credits started to roll we both sat up and said ""was that it???!!!"". Actually we were glad this torture was over. Boring is an understatement, horror film this is not, for there are no scary moments and the twist is obvious to say the least. I repeat, this is not a horror! It is a love story, yes! People walked out of the theatre in boredom, I heard rows and rows of sighing all the way through, you could sense the boredom in the theatre! I was up for walking out but seeing this trash til the end gives me reason to despise it even more. And I have to point out one thing...the ""Things we don't speak of"" that are in the forest?? That's ALL they bloody spoke about! Boring boring boring trash watch it at your peril!!!!!!!!!",The Village

It is slow, it is not for everyone, but if you enjoy solid acting, consistency and a good story line then give this a try, some films on IMDb and rival sites have ratings that do not correlate with the actual films standing, this is one of them. I would give the film a higher rating, but i watch a lot, and apart from the likes of, ""IF"" or ""Life Of Brian"" i rarely pass out 9's or 10's. Of course, anything with Mr Phoenix is watchable, he excels in himself and rarely disappoints, and if you ever come across the directors cut of ""Walk The Line"" i strongly recommend you put by some hours for one of his best performances to date",The Village
369,TobyS,A victim of his own success...,9,7 August 2004,"With The Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan took what was essentially a run-of-the-mill ghost story (albeit a well thought out run-of-the-mill ghost story), gave it one wallop of a twist ending, and thus became an overnight wonder boy that cursed all of his follow-up films.  I found Unbreakable to be dull and unimaginative, while Signs was taut, exciting and frightening. The ending, put me off with its simplicity on how the aliens are defeated, but not enough to not feel fully entertained, or that I hadn't gotten my money's worth.  However, neither of those films lived up to the expectations that were placed upon them.Now, Shyamalan takes us into The Village, and judging by the horrendous write-ups, coupled with the film's nosedive at the box office, not many people enjoyed the trip.   William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver and Adrien Brody are residents in a sleepy 19th century village surrounded by deeps woods.  The woods are inhabited by creatures that the town's people have a shaky truce with.  For reasons that aren't fully, clearly explained (one of the films few faults), that truce seems to have ended, and the creatures begin to assault the village.  A series of events climax with the daughter of the town father venturing into the woods to seek help from the outside.To say anything more would risk giving away the big twist that Shyamalan is expected to deliver in each of his movies.  The Village has a couple of them this time.  One that I had an idea about, but was incorrect enough to still be surprised, and one that I had caught on to early on, but didn't fully figure out until right before it's reveal.Say what you will, but Shyamalan knows how to set up a film.  The picture is gorgeous.  It's crammed with sweeping vistas, leaf blown woods and skeleton-like trees.  The cast, for the most part, is also quite good.  I wasn't as in love with Joaquin Phoenix's performance as I was in Signs though.  He just kind of sleep walked though this film, and with the exception of one particular conversation on a porch, wasn't given that much to do or say.  I know his character is a man of few words, but this tested that boundary.  At the opposite end of the spectrum, Adrien Brody walked the line of being credible as a slow-witted adult, and being a cartoon.  While his performance wasn't bad, it didn't do much for me either.  Bryce Dallas Howard (daughter of Ron) portrays Ivy with such compassion and strength that she shows she's got the chops to be a rising star.  I look forward to her next role.  Both Weaver and Hurt give strong performance, and the rest of the case fill in nicely.  Last, but certainly not least, I need to mention the score.  The music is haunting and adds loads of dread and suspense.
*******SPOILER.DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU IF YOU READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH********I just need to mention one part of the film that I picked up on, kept going over in my head, and now wonder if it was simply an error on the part of Shyamalan, or meant to be a clue to the ending.  The film opens with a funeral.  When the camera shows the tombstone in the background, notice the dates, especially the date of death.  Even for that date, the village, people, customs and language seem awfully old.  If I hadn't noticed the date, I would have guessed the people to be living at least a hundred or more years prior to the date the tombstone shows.
*******END OF SPOILERS **********The Sixth Sense came from nowhere, and was such a sensation because nobody saw it coming.  Shyamalan is now expected to top himself with each film, and none of them can or will reach that height again.  The Village is a well thought-out, entertaining film.  It may not be perfect, but if any other name was in the writer/director's credit, I think it would be hailed to as close to perfection as one can get.My grade: A",The Village
370,fedtho,Shyamalan on a new mission: making his own movies,8,31 December 2004,"I'd like to very warmly redirect everyone to dog_bites_back's comment. He says most of what is essential, namely about the misleading marketing THE VILLAGE has badly suffered from.From the viewing of 'The sixth sense' on, I can recall how deeply grateful I was for the feeling there was finally someone who had that genuine love for movies AND the talent/ability to use the means of a big production in a way that, in the end, you have an impression of INTIMACY.This I found again in THE VILLAGE. Walking out of it, there surely were questions, irritations, feelings that the movie wasn't well balanced in some ways...But there is so much to find in it that the movie still gives me more, by far, than it frustrates me. It is generous, it is sincere (in my opinion at least), it tells a story and puts you in a state that are VERY unexpected. That's the highest of what I expect from a movie.The ambiance, the mysterious uneasiness between the inhabitants, the numerous secrets most of which remain basically unanswered (not typically Hollywood, now, is it?): all those points make it something precious. Something leaving space for you to travel into the story with your own life, your feelings, your memories.I still can imagine very well that you'll be totally puzzled, or even unnerved, if you're not in the right mood for it.The trailers, as dog_bites_back points out, are so completely WRONG that it's a joke. And a suicidal one at that: they surely HAVE done the film and its career some terrible damage, as you could only be very disappointed when, after being promised some ""BLAIRWITCH PROJECT meets THE HOWLING meets SEVEN meets Lars van Trier"" product, you discover something that has more to do with Ingmar Bergman.Oh yes, it does. The rural setting of the action, the village and the woods, supernatural elements, the depth of the characters and the intensity of the acting, all this can be related to the Master from Sweden.I almost forgot, because it is so obvious, but the film is so beautifully photographed it takes your breath away (and always serves the story, my opinion again...).After taking good notice that you WILL NOT see a horror-flick with the clever Shyamalan touch, you should ABSOLUTELY see this movie, one of the most original works on the big screen for a long time.",The Village
371,dgeer80,A great film...if you're not looking for something scary.,8,14 January 2005,"If you walk into this film thinking it's a thriller (which I don't blame anyone for except the people who marketed this film), you may just walk out disappointed. There aren't really that many scary things about this film. However, if you walk into it expecting quality drama, acting and storytelling, you might just find something likable about it.M. Night Shyalmalan (director of ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs,"") brings us an intriguing period piece about love, jealousy, and how far people are willing to go when driven by fear.An ""Amish"" type community resides in an isolated village surrounded by a forest with a dark history. They fear ""those they do not speak of"" who dwell in the woods, and dare not cross their path. But when a dire need of medicine from the towns beyond the woods emerges, one blind woman dares to face the dark in order to bring back the light.The film has an interesting (and creepy) atmosphere to it - a characteristic few movies these days are able to accomplish. One particular shot that comes to mind is between the two main characters, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) and the blind woman Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), when they're talking on the porch. It's a close-up profile shot of them talking, and in between their faces you see a gray fog covering the vast field in front of them - making the audience wonder what's out there watching them. It really symbolizes that not everything may be as it seems.The performances given by William Hurt(AI: Artificial Intelligence), Bryce Dallas Howard, and Joaquin Phoenix really make this film stand on firm ground. But perhaps the most interesting character is that of Noah Percy, played by Adrien Brody (The Pianist). He plays a mentally-challenged, and sometimes unstable man who happens to be in love with Ivy Walker. When he finds out that she's in love with Lucius Hunt, his unstable characteristics really start to take hold of him (as well as creep out the audience).If this were the first film from Shyamalan, it would be critically acclaimed. But since this is his fourth major film, and Shyamalan is now known for putting plot twists in his stories, people go into it immediately starting to second-guess everything they observe. So many people would probably figure out the twist long before the film ends because they're already looking for it. Either that, or they spend the whole film waiting in anticipation for it, only to be let down because they built it up to be the Second Coming. They remember how cool it was to discover what really happened to Bruce Willis' character in ""The Sixth Sense."" But they forget that, at that time, they had never seen a film quite like it before. They had no preconceived notions or expectations.As much as I enjoyed ""The Village,"" I think Shyamalan should stop making films with plot twists for a while and just make some good movies with good stories. And he should not hype it up by advertising it as ""An M. Night Shyalmalan Film."" That name is now immediately connected with plot twists and thrillers whenever someone sees it. Otherwise, he may very well come to be known as ""M. Night Shyamalamadingdong.""",The Village
372,youdontsmellbad,"because the buildup to it is thrilling, it works.",7,30 July 2004,"The trouble with The Village, as I suspected would be the case is that it's being sold as a horror movie starring Joaquin Phoenix.  Didn't the bro population realize when tiffany didn't jump terrified onto their crotches during Signs that the sixth sense guy doesn't really make horror movies?  He makes M. Night Shyamalan movies, which are a different thing.Now the movie was good.  That said, I think you're all going to hate it.Yes it's centered around a huge plot twist AGAIN, like you're hoping.  And yes, I like the twist.  What I like about it is that it prompts discussion afterward, and because it makes you go back and reprocess everything, and because the buildup to it is thrilling, it works.  Again an important note is there's a brief maybe ten minutes of the film where you think the twist has happened and there seems to be no point in watching the movie.  In order to survive this part I'll tell you in advance (no spoilers) that the movie flounders (At the point where Michael Pitt chickens out), but sort of recovers when it explains what the deal is.But the problem around this point is it really feels like it's being explained.  And not only that but the plot doubles back in time and has totally unnecessary voice-over bits that really give the feeling of a drunk guy telling a story, leaving an important part out and then going `before I tell this next part, I forgot to tell you that'  Then the developments unfold in such a way that the writer's hand is clearly visible, thumping a few really clunky plot devices together and they don't quite fit (for later reference I mean Adrien Brody and what's under the floorboards, for one thing) but when it's over I smile I grin and I walk out of the theater because the twist got me, kind of.So what you know about the plot is that people in the village are afraid of some kind of creatures in the woods.  Now, knowing what you know you'll probably almost start to guess the plot twist correctly that's why I said it got me kind of.Of course the other reason it works is because Night is so well-versed in the tricks of the trade.  His moves all give the sense that you're being manipulated in every way imaginable and having a good time at it.  He takes all the tricks, the frustrating camera angles, slow reveals and explosive rack focuses and throws them  all together so that rather than feel cheated you come to enjoy being tricked.  That's the fun of his style.And once again great casting fills in the space left by some of the plot holes.  After this you'll be saying `Joaquin who?'  yeah he's kind of forgettable in the movie but there's this actress, Bryce Dallas Howard (seeming WAY too old to be Ron Howard's daughter) who absolutely knocks it out the park as his blind love interest.   A stellar blind performance: convincing without being cloying and begging for sympathy, yet strong without being a joke. Adrien Brody is in it (who knew?) as the village idiot.  He'll knock your socks off until the plot is in more way more control of the character than the actor is.This is not the best example of what Shyamalan can do, in fact it's his worst so far, but it's valuable because since the plot is so transparent this time around, you can really study how his mind works.",The Village
373,vivalarsx,Without a Twist,5,1 August 2004,"I kept wanting to like this movie more than I did.  The problem, in my view, is the ""twist.""  Because Shyamalan is so known for surprise endings, it seems that he caves into the pressure to have one.  I won't reveal it here, though I think it is what does the film in.  Rather than have the ""big surprise"" (which I DID figure out--and I'm no supergenius) at the end, I found myself much more interested in that backstory.  How much better the film would be if the ""twist"" were actually the beginning of the movie, and not a surprise at all.  One is given only the surprise; what one needs is all the information to let you in on ALL the implications of that surprise. I saw the movie this morning and keep filling in all the blanks myself. Because what is quickly glossed over is actually a compelling story full of sacrifice, hard work, and guilt.  Now, THAT movie I would line up to see--without a surprise in view. Having said all this--and it probably makes no sense unless you have seen the film--I will add that Shyamalan remains a superb technician:  there are individual shots and sometimes entire scenes of such evocative beauty that I found myself holding my breath.  Specifically, the scene of Ivy standing in the doorway, with her hand held out, waiting--that was tense and lovely. And the long, static shot of Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard sitting on the porch and talking in profile was just gorgeous--it was also the best-acted sequence in the movie not involving Sigourney Weaver (who gives the single best performance in the film--maybe her best ever). The Village could have been astounding, had Shyamalan not felt it so necessary to tweak us.  Without relying on a big shock, he could have filled this film full-to-bursting with prodigious emotion.",The Village
374,Samualt,"Great drama, but not a horror as billed.",8,30 July 2004,"Like most of Shyamalan's movies, this is a drama/thriller, not a horror movie at all. The ads are totally off-the-mark and deceive people into thinking this is a horror movie. Fraudulent advertising? Well, not really. But they are encouraging the wrong audience. People who like ""Dawn of the Dead"" are showing up and being totally let down by this horror imposter. This movie would have much better reviews and a bigger audience if the ads were a little more realistic about what it is. I too was expecting a horror and was a little let down by it. But it was a great drama flick nevertheless.I really liked Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy Walker and Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius Hunt. These two actors pretty much carry the show. In fact, if it wasn't for them the movie would have been just so so. Bryce has only appeared in about 5 films and I walked away from this one wondering why? She simply has that star quality that few in hollywood possess. I'm sure we will see her in many more films to come!So, if you are looking for a horror movie don't bother. But if you want a good drama/thriller then by all means enjoy the show. The acting is good, the direction is good, and the story has nice twists and turns. Just have the right attitude and don't be taken in by the ads for this movie. I will never trust an ad for one of Shyamalan's flicks again! Shyamalan is simply no George Romero or Wes Craven. Shyamalan's medium is drama, not horror!",The Village
375,PlugInYourBrain,Not as bad as I thought,5,22 September 2012,"I had heard a lot of bad things about The Village, capped off by the fact someone blurted out the 'twist ending' to me shortly after it was released . I blame Shyamalan for that as much as the person who did the blurting: People talk, and too many (all!) of Shyamalan's movies depend on a 'twist at the end.'So when I finally saw The Village I had very low expectations indeed. The good news is: I wasn't disappointed. It was better than expected.M. Night Shyamalan's master plan seems to be to make each one of his movies half as good as the one before but even when he makes a bad movie (which is often these days), it's hard to notice because the cinematography, the acting, the scenery, the music are so good you don't notice. ('The Happening' however was 'A Bridge too Far'. :-)As usual, two things bring Shyamalan down: Gaping holes in the plot, and his own cameo performances.The plot holes are a major problem. I liked the idea that the main character was a blind girl. She was interesting and I thought she was well played, but why send a blind girl into the woods? I get lost in the woods and I'm fully sighted! Too often Shyamalan rushes off and shoots a movie without first filling in the plot holes. The last minute retro-fixes he adds by narration (by no less than his cameo) are unconvincing.Shyamalan is a lousy actor, and the cameos destroy the suspension of disbelief the audience is trying so hard to maintain by overlooking his glaring plot holes. Besides ego, why does he keep ruining his movies by doing this? The film has good production qualities. William Hurt and Bryce Dallas Howard turn in good performances, but other actors are underused. Sigourney Weaver barely opens her mouth.Moral dilemmas are poorly explored: There are many, many children in this movie. Surely one of them needed a pediatrician by now? Why does Joaquin Phoenix's character merit an exception when the sick children didn't? Shyamalan has a line of dialog that suggests he was the victim of a crime where as the children died because it was 'their time'. You're kidding me?When will movie studios understand that mis-marketing a movie is a recipe for disaster? Fight Club was mis-marketed to the WWF crowd, and The Village was mis-marketed as a Horror Film. This attracted and then alienated the wrong audience. There is some suspense, but it's subdued: We never get a sense of fear for the creatures, and even when we meet the guard he's too damned nice too fast. Gosh I like nice people too, but it just wasn't convincing.The Village is more like an episode of the Twilight Zone. I wasn't bored, so would give it six out of ten. But I'm deducting a point for the plot holes and the cameo. That's a bit harsh, but this is Shyamalan's fourth major movie so he really should know better by now.",The Village
376,quantumcat,"Not the bad movie people make it out to be, but I can understand why they are disappointed",8,27 January 2005,"there may be spoilers up ahead, but I'll try to steer away from them:I am one of those that appreciate ""the village"" When I started to watch the movie I'd expected a see a second ""Signs"" (which was by it's ridiculous ""man-in-a-suit"" ending a bit disappointing after the tension had been so brilliantly built up)What I noticed right away was the beautiful cinematography which excels in subtlety. The same can be said about the acting. Greatly scored as well.Again it had subtle and brilliant built up of tension. Shymalan's trademark. Was it to be a standard Shymalan movie *****sort-of-spoiler:*****Then at a third of the movie it had a man in a suit momentBecause of the acting, the cinematography I decided to continue watching. Shymalan takes a lot of time introducing his characters, which makes them 3D persons and give the actors the chance to give it their best. It also makes you -the viewer- want to see what happens to them next.Then the creatures show up again -again my man-in-a-suit-fear became true, was this to be the real horror of this movie?I felt disappointed -this is not the horror thriller I thought it was.But then there was this moment -all but silence save the score...""Howard holds out her hand while the creature runs towards her, and Phoenix grabs it and they go foe the trapdoor to the cellar almost like a couple of ballerina's -reminescent of Chinese movies like ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""House of the Flying Daggers""In all the events following it started to dawn: this movie isn't the horror-thriller I'd expected but a well played =well directed -well scored -well written drama-thriller.So the more plot becomes clear the more you understand this transformation from apparently horror to psycho-drama-thriller. Though I felt the clue was not entirely unexpected and a bit unbelievable, I was fascinated.It is in my opinion people think it a bad movie since they expected a horror-thriller and got a psychological-drama-thriller.So all-in-all I think it's a great movie that disappoints due to expectations that were falsely raised by a misleading PR campaign.So if you watch this movie with either NO expectations or with the knowledge it's a psychological-thriller-drama you're in for a wonderfully cinematographically styled , ingeniously scored and brilliantly acted show!Have fun!",The Village

However, this close-knit community lives with the frightening belief that a race of frightening creatures resides in the woods surrounding their village.The sanctity of 'The Village' is held in constant check by a sort of an unwritten treaty with the creatures referred to by the townspeople as 'Those We Don't Speak Of.' The villagers live in a state of constant fear of the evil and foreboding force that lurks outside their tranquil settlement. So terrified are the people that no one dares venture beyond 'The Village' perimeter into the darkness of the woods. Despite the advice of his elders, a curious and determined Lucius Hunt (JOAQUIN PHOENIX) has a burning desire to step beyond the boundaries of the town into the unknown to bring back supplies and medicine from neighboring villages. Town leader, Edward Walker (WILLIAM HURT) warns Lucius of the danger beyond the town's outskirts, and Lucius' mother, Alice Hunt (SIGOURNEY WEAVER) begs him to stay at home and spare himself the greed and desires that exist in the outside world.Lucius' strength and courage is matched only by Ivy Walker (BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD), a beautiful and mesmerizing young blind woman with a profound wisdom well beyond her years. Her fearless nature and gift-like perceptions are beyond anything Lucius has ever known. Both Lucius and the mischievous village idiot, Noah Percy (ADRIEN BRODY) admire Ivy passionately, though her heart only has room for one of them. Her devotion eventually leads her down a tortured forbidden path where terrifying truths are revealed and sudden violence plays out its fearful hand. The so-called truce between 'The Village' and the creatures seems to be ending and the ominous presence of the unknown force ultimately boils over into chaos for the town. And so, the story begins to unfold.Brilliantly directed by M. Night Shyamalan, this haunting saga's music and direction sends terrifying chills and conjures up horrifying images waiting at every turn only to turn out as ordinary events or things. Much like his previous movie, 'Sixth Sense', Shyamalan has a knack for creating tension and fear without having to produce a terrifying giant lizard such as in 'Jurassic Park' to justify the terror. The fear and respect given to these unseen creatures seems analogous to what early man must have gone through as beliefs were formed as the result of real and/or imagined forces that ultimately set up certain behaviors that were thought to placate these forces. In 'The Village', the people learned to avoid the color red and would go about destroying any red plants. Occasionally a slaughtered animal was left at the edge of the Village to appease the creatures. They learned to wear certain colors they were led to believe would keep the creatures away. Essentially, the effect was to create an artificial religion that may have ultimately bloomed into a fully formed and organized faith, much like island natives who worshiped and sacrificed animals and people to volcano gods in order to appease them.The acting was superior to most films, however, nowhere near the level of an Academy Award. The film is to be admired for its ability to keep you terrified and involved; however, after a while it became quite wearisome when no bogeymen appeared to justify all that uproar and tension. Once the plot unfolded, it held many surprises, although somewhat implausible. Basically a fairy tale, the 'Village' is worthy of attendance as long as there is plenty of popcorn available to dispel the tension of two hours of fright.",The Village
378,rodolfoIII,Interesting,7,30 July 2004,"Interesting film! If Night Shyamalan (director) keep making movies like these.. he has a future! I really didn't expect the things I saw in this film! This movie demonstrates what you are willing to do ultimately for love despite fear, threats and inevitably one's demise! Despite all the things that point to the contrary some people are born different and are destined to challenge things in life...! This film shows both the extreme & wrong way to love AND/OR the right way to follow our hearts. Making this choice will help you decide on the true motive of the movie. For me... will always follow my heart! Watch it without any expectations!",The Village

I'm glad I read some reveiws and toned down my anticipation before I went to see this movie. I give it a 10 outta 10. I had no problems with any part of it.

There were a few twists which were unexpected and the acting was faultless.It's not your usual over-the-top type of horror movie which I don't like anyway but it would be a disappointment if you had expectations.Best to go open-minded and be pleasantly surprised. 7/10(I count 10 lines but this isn't enough according to these stupid regulations!

381,Leatherface33,I loved it.,10,31 July 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. That's the only word I can think ofdescribing him. When watching The Village, it was as though he wasreading my mind and the movie changed according to my thoughts. And Idon't mean that it was predictable. SPOILER AHEAD During the first half or so of the movie, I thought that it was a coolplot, but I just didn't feel the tension and fear of the townspeople.There were creatures in the woods, and when Jaquien Phoenix's characterentered the woods, I just didn't find myself frightened for what wouldhappen to him. Why? I have no idea, but later on in the film, when youlearn there are no creatures, it turned out there was nothing to harmhim. So, I didn't feel scared, and it turned out there was nothing to bescared of! How Night did this, God only knows.    All in all, I just thought this was a great movie. Good visuals, goodpop-out scary moments, and an amazing script. The twist at the end wasawesome, to say in the least, and I didn't find it disappointing at all.The only part of the movie that angered me was the end. Because I didn'twant it to end, because I was enjoying it so much. ............",The Village
382,A_Friend_of_Sarah_Connor,"Undoubtedly, Shyamalan's magic touch has worn off (SPOILERS)",1,16 March 2005,"*WARNING: This review contains spoilers that reveal the movie's ""big"" twist*Was the twist for 1999's ""The Sixth Sense"" that much of a shocker that people would ignore the other problems with the film? Admittedly, ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" were a lot better in comparison, but still weren't anywhere near classics. Then Shyamalan goes and makes ""The Village"", a movie so pointless and dull it makes me wonder if Ed Wood was really all that bad. At least his films are entertaining.In my opinion, Shyamalan is an overrated hack whose reputation far exceeds his actual talents as a director. Sure, he clearly loves movies and has a knack of making his films appear more frightening than they really are through marketing, but he fails in creating an actual atmosphere for his individual projects. Even the standard ""boo!"" moments associated with horror films aren't effective; the set-up is there, but the pacing is off. Viewed a second time, these scenes come off worst because the audience can think about the plot holes. Two such scenes are when the monsters attack the village for the first time and the scene where the protagonist, Ivy (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) has a confrontation with a monster.Regardless, the movie actually does have a decent premise: the citizens of a mysterious, late nineteenth-century village supposedly have a truce with demonic beings that live in the woods surrounding the town. As long as the townspeople stay away from the woods, the creatures would leave them alone. Unfortunately, some children venture into the forest, thereby breaking the truce and angering the monsters. Soon after the creatures attack the village as punishment, one of the villagers, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), is critically injured and Ivy has to go out in search of medicine that can save him. Her quest is impeded with the fact that she is blind and because of her attraction to Lucius.All this unfolds at a ridiculously slow pace as Shyamalan sets up the characters and their situation. After developing this narrative for an hour and a half, Shyamalan, as expected, comes up with a twist: it's revealed that not only are there no monsters at all, but the villagers are in fact living in a present day park preserve. By this point, it is terribly obvious that Shyamalan is willing to do just about anything to catch the audience off guard, but this laughably absurd resolution is just too much. Why not just tell a straightforward drama about a few seniors fooling their offspring into living an Amish-like existence instead of trying to pawn the film off as a horror movie? The answer to that question is actually quite simple: Shyamalan has the reputation of being a ""thriller movie"" director and he has to maintain this illusion; thus the pretext of ""The Village"" looking like a horror movie for most of the running length and it being marketed as such. Of course, this misguided approach destroys any chance of there being a rewatchability factor: why bother to see the movie again if we know that Noah (of all people), played by Adrien Brody, is the one who dresses up as a monster to keep the townspeople away from the woods? What is really the point of structuring an entire movie on one single plot twist?Shyamalan also tries to build up tension in certain scenes, but he's no Hitchcock. His previous movies all had at least a couple of good scary moments, but everything here is just so dull it is hard for a viewer to get invested in the characters and their plight. Are we really supposed to care about some paper-thin villagers being chased down by anonymous monsters, especially when we know there are no monsters at all? The director simply cannot create enough suspense for the movie to work even the first time around. Shyamalan's best effort, ""Unbreakable"", doesn't try to fool the audience into thinking it's a horror movie; it works on it's own and not by playing on the audiences' expectations.Of course, among the mess of a narrative, there are nonetheless a few bright spots. James Newton Howard delivers a haunting score that adjusts to whatever the movie is pretending to be at that moment. Roger Deakins' cinematography is wonderful and it at least gives us something to look at while we're being bored out of our skulls. Finally, while Shyamalan's reputation seems only to get worse with every proceeding film he makes, he still manages to attract a rather good cast, which includes Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, and Brendan Gleeson. All of these actors manage to rise above the material, but they cannot save the movie.""The Village"" is no doubt one of the most uneven and lifeless films of recent times. It was painfully clear in 2004 that Shyamalan was way past his ""best by"" date, yet he has gone on to make two more atrocities: 2006's ""Lady in the Water"" and 2008's ""The Happening"". These three films, taken together, confirm one thing: that M. Night Shyamalan has no business making movies and should seriously consider pursuing other ventures; anything to spare movie audiences from having to bear another one of his catastrophes. 1/10",The Village
383,what3v3r,"A must watch , although only once",10,24 March 2005,"Mind Boggling plot twists are undoubtedly Shyamlans prerogative. The entire span of the movie is basically a contrivance aimed at involving the viewer in a mindset which would warrant all sorts of ""sighs""and ""wows"". Although the movie does have a few shortcomings, the contrivance itself has been very well crafted. The ending truly does baffle you. However, with repeated viewings , a bunch of incoherencies do tend to crop up. But that is the case with almost every movie in this genre.That sense of originality which is the quintessence of Shymalans movies, is very much present in ""The Village"". And as ever, the final sequence of event will leave you guessing and contemplating. This movie is somewhat chillingly creepy and tends to send pulses up and down your spine at times. The Village beats The Sixth Sense in the race for ""Shyamalan' masterpiece"". Personally, ""The Sixth Sense"" was more predictable than this one. With this movie, he does live up to every expectation warranted by his previous works.Bryce Dallas Howard irrevocably deserves more laurels for her performance in this movie.

I also believe that this film should be investigated by the Trading Standards as the trailer misleads the people of the world that this is a scary horror and a good film.DO NOT BE FOOLED. When the end finally approached I had this sudden urge to find someone behind the kiosk and demand my money back. If they refused, I would then make them watch it but then I would painfully have too watch as well.Alternative and more useful idea than watching this movie:- Take your money and buy some out of date food and eat it.

There is no denying that ""The Sixth Sense"" is an intelligent and ingenious film. But then came ""Signs"" - one of the most over-rated movies of 2002 and now our once promising writer/director has come up with ""The Village"". On paper, this must have looked like complete hogwash, but somehow the studio thought that it had wings and would transcend the vapid scribblings that called itself a movie script. Sadly they were horribly wrong. In spite of some seriously talented actors, the writer/director managed to produce a profoundly empty and immensely boring movie where almost nothing happens. A movie where you cared little about any of the characters; a movie with about as much tension as grandmas old discarded knickers. I won't try and bore you with an outline of the plot, because it barely exists. You will come to the end of this movie, turn to your friend/partner/lover and say,""What was that all about?"". If you feel a primeval need to watch this drivel, then see it on DVD.

Yet, it fades into pap. Not the actors fault, but the directors for not having the balls. The control by fiction of demons over the mass of ignorant people is a serious problem. The reason a blind woman was sent out was because she could not see the lie perpetrated by the 'wise' when she got out and report back. This is what governments do about the horrors of war, never report back the reality, only hero's and lies about glory. Thus, they are in control of ordinary men and women. Shame on the director for not following through his intent. I have guessed the endings to all his films. He is apparent. He has the importunity, but not the talent. Yet, he does try to have a go at moral subjects which is more than can be said of many directors who aim for cheap thrills.

390,j_crist,the usual mediocrity,1,16 April 2005,"As usual the director has made another mediocre film. It's basically a student film far too long. The story could have been told in less than an hour episode and it could have been as well as a TV film. Such a waste of actors but I guess they have to pay their bills as well. Dialogues were at time even irritating for how they were obvious and bad. Cinematic ally speaking the film had nice images, not special though but that's the job of a cinematographer who is another person employed for the film. This director strangely enough writes and direct overrated movies, still manages movie after movie. For one thing is very skilled of is finding financiers and producers because anyone else coming out with those ""thin"" scripts with one plot would be impossible to sell even the ideas. I believe at film school they might teach story constructions and all but perhaps he didn't even go to a film school. He was already a genius, check out his homemade film he is so proud to show in each DVD. It's insulting the intelligence of the audience. I wish only that the reviewer would write honest article when his movies are released but because of what probably the distribution companies pay to the magazine by the time the film is going into the theaters all reviews are great (even though many magazine don't even get a screening copy or preview, weird isn't it?!) but months after that the same film magazines publish other reviews and usually those are more ""realistic"", in fact the latest I read finally told the truth, this movie sucks!!!",The Village

It didn't happen with 'Unbreakable' though - again he kept me glued until the revelations, especially the totally unexpected last one.When I came to 'The Village', though, I had all that foreknowledge, together - having seen 'Signs' - with the awareness that MKS is entirely capable of making utter dogs as well. 'Village' was not a real surprise, therefore, except in its sheer awfulness.This is deeply bad, and you have to wonder: does MKS know it? Is he spending the time between these successively poorer works writhing internally, tortured by his inability to reclaim the magic? Pressured by the expectation of his peers and his public to produce more rabbits from his now apparently empty hat? It's clear that he's reaching for the same formula: 1-2-3 dazzling revelations in close succession that leave the audience giddy with delight and admiration for the way they've been manipulated and misled.It's not working anymore, though: and the mutilations of plausibility that bringing these revelations to light entails have become so grievous that they go way past what is possible with mere suspension of disbelief, and now require either base intellectual negligence or hallucinogenic drugs. Sure - send the blind girl! Yes - lock the loony in the room with the costume under the floorboards! Fine - let's make the first guy she meets have access to antibiotics! Perfect - no-one will notice! You should have quit while you were ahead, M, which was just after 'Unbreakable'. Maybe a decade cogitating in the wilderness would have allowed some cream to rise.

394,glocksout,White Night,4,14 August 2006,"Art is a relevant critique of life. Through the use of images and metaphors, storytellers reflect on contemporary issues through a neutral medium to the subconscious. M. Night Shyamalan has always done a good job retelling important lessons through the medium of feature films. One of his most anticipated films was The Village in 2004, but it failed to meet the high expectations of the critics and fans.Shyamalan has a way of taking a situation and putting an odd spin to it. Your subconscious recognizes the setting, but also notices something is out of place. In The Village you see a puritanical style colony, but it's got taints of the modern-day to it. Clothing, language, and other elements hint at an anachronistic community.The cast is made up of very talented individuals (this is before most of them were really known in Hollywood), and the cinematography was pleasant. However, through the elements of suspense, romance and tragedy, the audience is really set aloof from the whole thing. I was sort of detached from everything that transpired throughout the film.While I appreciated the stylings Shyamalan brings to this film, it altogether did not achieve its potential. It left me wanting more.",The Village
395,NotTheOne000,M Night: genius and subversive,10,11 February 2005,"M Night Shyamalan is an allegorical director  this is the thought that must be remembered whenever you go to watch one of his films. Unbreakable, for example, is not a film about a man who realises he has super powers; it is actually a story examining the relationship between a man and his wife and son, and the relationship between the individual and his or her more general relationship with society.So it is with The Village  look at the details: 1) All the inhabitants are white and middle or upper class. 2) There is no alcohol or pre-marital sex. 3) There is no rock or rap music or TV or internet.In other words, The Village is an idealised modern gated community of the type springing up all over the US.So: dangerous towns = urban life invented monsters = imaginary paedophiles and drug dealers bad colour = blood  the obsessive fear of any kind of physical harm Ivy's blindness = blindness to fear, which allows her to see what people are really like inside Lucius's bravery = an ability to overcome fear, this affords him the desire to explore the world The watchtowers = the creation of unnecessary security measures to further strengthen the fear needed to control the villagers Noah donning the monster's robe = the real dangers often come from within our own community, and grow out of ignorance, of jealousy and even, sometimes, love.One of the most significant points is made when Ivy leaves the Village and is surprised by the kindness of the young guard she meets. The only genuinely altruistic act of the entire film is carried out by a total stranger, who provides help to Ivy for no gain at risk of loosing his job. This is M Night telling us that goodness of heart does not come from indoctrination, but comes from normal human nature.In other words, rather than a failed horror film with an intrusive twist at the end, The Village is actually an intelligent commentary on the lies and deceits that neo-con white middle class America is perpetrating on its youth out of unjustified fear in a desire to engineer an ideal community based on ignorance and naiveté.Unfortunately, mainstream Hollywood has become so devoid of genuine imagination and intelligence that it can't spot genius when it is right under its nose. 10/10 from me.",The Village

402,Moonhawk1975,An eerie horror story undone by it's twist-filled aspirations,7,8 April 2005,"I'm really tired of twist endings. Today, they are used as a marketing device and are heavily promoted; used as a way to keep the viewer watching whether the movie is good or not. What the ""geniuses"" promoting these endings don't realize is that even if the movie is good, the viewer is unable to get involved because they are trying to guess what is going to happen. It makes it impossible to wrap yourself in the world unfolding on the screen before you. On the other hand, if the movie is bad, you feel cheated; in these cases, the twist is usually not supported by what happened before it. When I first saw the trailer for this movie, as I joke I turned to my wife and said what I thought the twist was. It turned out I was right.This movie actually contains three twists, none of which I will reveal. The movie is better if you don't know what happens and can make your own unprejudiced decisions upon viewing it for the first time. My wife loved it; I was disappointed. The first half hour was thrilling and terrifying. M. Night Shyamalan sets up his 19th century village and the evil lurking in the woods surrounding it wonderfully. When at first all we get are spooky noises emanating from the forest, I got the creeps. When one of the creatures made its way into the village, I was on the edge of my seat. Then came the first twist and I was honestly shocked. Shyamalan was not playing with my emotions, but had made a spellbinding tale that was deserving of them. Then, he started explaining everything and the movie was downhill from there. The second twist is of the variety I can't stand in movies and I was extremely let-down. By the time he reached the much-hyped third twist (the one I figured out before hand), I was unimpressed. The beginning of the movie deserved better.Twists and chills aside, I was impressed with the performance from the cast. The younger actors were actually better than the veterans; Bryce Dallas Howard is a pleasant discovery I can't wait to see in more movies. Joaquin Phoenix is continuing to mold himself into an ever better actor; his early performances left something to be desired, but he improves with each movie. William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, as two of the elders of the village, were a bit disappointing. They are better actors than they seemed here and have proved it in better (and worse) movies than this. My opinion changed, however, after the final twist was revealed; I felt it explained the inferior acting among these cast members.",The Village
403,captainmarvel1331,Another nice Shyalaman title.,8,12 October 2005,"M. Night Shyalaman had always given us good films with nice, sorta obvious, twists at the end but are always pleasing. And unlike some directors, and as some critics might think, his movies aren't exactly the same. Sure, they have some sort of twist at the end and are always super-natural, but think about his past movies. The Sixth Sense was his first; great film by the way, and then came Unbreakable. Which was also good, but strayed away from the horror feeling and had a more mature essence, that implying the torture scene. Then Signs came along to be his best film yet, with a great take on crop circles and their possible meanings. And now, The Village. Joaquin Phoenix makes his second appearance in Shyalaman's collection as the ambitious yet quiet citizen of an out-of-date village in the middle of some forest surrounded by monsters of some kind. But don't count on the commercials to give you accurate information. Two things the commercials don't tell you. One: Phoenix is NOT the main character. He is actually removed from the picture half way through the flick. And two: Bryce Dallas Howard, that red-headed girl, is blind. Yeah, she can't see. Anyway, the film is unique and original and is more of a romance then a Sci-fi movie. But don't think Shyalaman didn't forget about the suspense and horror. The mysterious monsters enter the village many times to give you a fright, but the real horror happens in a specific forest scene where Howard actually encounters the monster first hand. And he certainly didn't forget the twist at the end. And its not so obvious this time. I actually had to see the movie two times before I fully understood it. Please don't not see this movie because you don't like Shyalaman or you think it will be too scary. It's a great movie with above average acting and an intriguing story that keeps you interested. Shyalaman never seems to let us down. Or at least me.",The Village
404,mrstrangerjones,"Not ""After Earth"", but not ""The Sixth Sense""",6,6 April 2018,"I was enthralled with this film. M. Night Shyamalan has crafted a very atmospheric thriller and an interesting drama. I really liked the performances from Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, and (possibly my favorite out of the three) Adrien Brody. The story was also well-crafted.However, it was the plot twist that really made the film worse. (The one at the very end, not the earlier one)This felt kinda forced, and also dumb. However, since then, I have thought about it and the twist does make a bit of sense. It might not even be as dumb as I think it is.This is where Shyamalan dwindled, but I hope he comes back to his heights of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" with his next film, ""Glass"".",The Village
405,aktowfik,Forget about the plot.. Who cares ?,9,2 June 2006,"I don't care about the plot of this movie. I knew from the beginning that there will be a big twist. My 11 YO son foresaw it after 10 minutes, and I don't claim he's a genius. What remains from the works of Mr MNS is THE ATMOSPHERE. He can build the atmosphere of fear and apprehension perfectly in ALL his works. Watch ""The village"" alone at 2 am and U will admit that. The jungle surrounded by torch flames, the kids playing courage games, the apprehension and the anticipation. This s fun.. This s real cinema. MNS is a genius, and I daresay he outdid Hitchcok in creation of suspense. Anyway, the curse of Sixth Sense will haunt him forever. He started from the summit .. Nowhere else to go but down.. Being the genius he is he kept struggling and he kept there, but people keep awaiting his fall eagerly.",The Village

Now to the most important part.The Boom mic shows up like 7 times in the movie!!!!!!!Never have i seen a boom mic show up so much in scenes. It should have been credited as having a role in the film.

It should have been made in the style of the wonderful TV series Twlight Zone. I think the writers of that series would have made an episode of 30 minutes with this story.I have seldom been so bored as with this movie. The clue was so clear, from very early in the movie, I really can't understand what all the hype was about. Series like Twilight Zone, Buffy and Angel have clues like this in almost every episode, and have better suspense.I did laugh several times. But I'm quite sure the makers of this movie did not intend me to laugh at those times.The acting was not too bad. But the actors had to work with a silly script. And they had to be slow, dull, a bit dim even.Don't waste your time with this movie. It is slow. So very slow.",The Village

Night Shyamalan takes us to an isolated and withdrawn community that lives in fear of evil creatures inhabiting the surrounding forests.,6,8 October 2021,"The scenario is interesting and rather well constructed and Shyamalan manages to captivate us for almost two hours. Inspired by the Amish community and offering reflections around Political within the community as well as the way of life of these people, that is to stay away from modern consumer society.But despite being a good movie, the twist was predictable too quickly in the story, unlike its author's previous films, as well as the fact that it's not always thrilling. But that does not remove the qualities which contains this ""The Village"", in particular a palpable tension at certain times as well as very good interpretations, in first place Joaquin Phoenix. The staging is successful, it's almost a lesson in cinema at this level. It is also the last good film of its author before he inexplicably fell from a height.",The Village

On the whole I enjoyed the movie, it was well crafted and all the actors gave great performances. I guess that I felt let down with the fact that the monsters ""the ones of who we never speak"" don't actually exist, they are just a huge con- job created by the village elders to stop the other villagers pushing the boundary of their world. And since the movie was sold on the sole fact of a monster that never even existed in the first place spoiled a otherwise excellent film.",The Village

411,cdipatri,I needed a little more (careful...spoiler),8,3 August 2004,"As with the previous Shyamalan movies, I loved the way he makes films.  I always feel like I'm right there in the movie with the characters.  I thought the story was excellent, especially due to the fact that I would love to live in a small society practically independent on the modern world (except for my computer and cable modem...lol).  I'm going to say this film was very good.  Not quite on the same level as Sixth Sense, The (1999) or Signs (2002), but I'll definitely buy the DVD when it's available.  M. Night Shyamalan has a distinct way of storytelling and film making that appeals to me and this one was no exception.  It was a good story, good characters and great suspense.  However, I felt that the end was too abrupt. I thought 2 or 3 more minutes showing how Ivy and Lucius carry on the tradition of the village life would have been a more fitting ending.  Regardless of this, I did really enjoy it and recommend you see it in the theater because the scenery is beautiful.  Also, being from Philly, I gotta support the hometown boys.  Go, Night.  Another good one.",The Village
412,Chukar,Enough of these,3,17 January 2005,"I bought this film on DVD and watched it at home with my wife on our digital wide-screen. I didn't know what to expect but I didn't comprehend another film with this type of ending. The Others had this type of ending as did the Sixth Sense. Those two films had some interesting interplay with the mystic and spirtial plots they had. This film was simply a scam, and the ending simply showed that once again what you were led to believe was not the truth. At that was the whole of it. I did not see that the ""Truth"" had anything much to do with the blind girl or her lover. Did he even live? I enjoyed the atmosphere and some parts, but I have to feel a bit like some of those who saw ""Mark of the Vampire"" for the first time. Although, I have to say that I enjoyed ""Mark"" a lot better and didn't feel that ripped off because the film had delivered; something I don't think The Village did. It was much a waste of time.",The Village
413,doctorx2,More than meets the eye,8,7 November 2006,"As previously noted by another viewer, this film was poorly marketed (as a ""horror movie""), which in point of fact it is not. It is indeed a multi-layered film.The film's opening lines (beautifully spoken by Brendan Gleeson) immediately establish the period and setting. The early-American dialog is intentionally stilted, but achieves a rhythm and beauty in its delivery by the members of the cast. The exception that proves the rule is William Hurt, whose off-center style and laissez-faire manner of speech make his lines feel forced and uncomfortable. He seems in general an improbable choice for the role of the patriarch of the Luddite community, unless this inconsistency of speech and style was intended as a clue to the viewer as to the real nature of the Village. Conversely, Bryce Dallas Howard is powerful and moving in the role of the blind girl, Ivy. Her pacing and diction feel natural and convincing. She persuades the audience that through innocence and love impossible things can be achieved. Joaquin Phoenix's restrained portrayal of Lucius is similarly effective, and the viewer believes in his conviction and honesty. Adrien Brody makes wonderful use of his dramatic features to create a vivid and disturbing man-child. Sigourney Weaver, Cherry Jones, and the rest of the cast deliver solid performances.The Village is a story about the futility of social engineering, a scary bed-time story, and after all, a love story. It can also been seen as an allegory for the upper middle-class retreat from urban post-modernism. Legions of Baby Boomers have spent fortunes in pursuit of the unhurried, simple but elegant life style characterized by Pottery Barn furniture and Martha Stewart's Country Living magazine. The return to traditional furnishings and even menus reflects a yearning for a simpler, more comprehensible, and safer way of life. Some might argue that this represents an exercise in denial, while defenders of this life style might insist that they are attempting to preserve worthwhile values, and/or create a haven of safety, be it ever so limited to the four walls of their homes, or the confines of their neighborhoods. Both of these arguments surface in The Village, and stir some consciousness about the the real world issue. It might even be suggested that The Village represents the United States of America, and that the wild and dangerous Covenington Woods is the rest of the world, as portrayed by Americans to Americans: a safe haven for our culture, surrounded by a dangerous world inhabited by bogeymen.In any event, a good film is one that invites contemplation, and there is ample food for thought in The Village.",The Village
414,kreamykonez97,Beware the bad color...for it attracts Roger Ebert...,10,9 December 2006,"THE VILLAGE 2004 (BRYCE HOWARD, JOAQUIN PHOENIX, WILLIAM HURT) DIRECTED BY: M. NIGHT SHYAMALAN ~ THE RUNDOWN: Shyamalan stays true to form in 2004, giving audiences around the world another stunning piece of style and originality. ~ First off, let me offer an oxymoron when looking at my rating and make clear the film is far from perfect. It's true, one could find several plot holes if looked for hard enough, but, then again, it IS just a movie. Also, the pacing is definitely off as the movie winds down too slowly. And, lastly, if you're a smartass just looking for a reason to blast this film to pieces from the start, you will find much of the dialogue laughable and may be monstrously harsh on a plot that isn't always sound. ~ But, my God, there's so much style to be found here. The detail and innovation of Shyamalan's craft is reminiscent of Kubrick's. M. Night creates a world within a world, a unique and completely captivating tale that has the ability to swamp those with imaginations as lively as his. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is pure art, and the Oscar nominated sound-score by James Newton Howard is eerily alluring, crawling deep inside of you and lingering far after the film is done. With only four major films in under five years under his belt, all of them widely successful, M. Night Shyamalan was able to achieve something the immensely overrated and under-talented Spielberg never did: an identifiable mark on each and every one of his movies, something I truly respect about the man. (Shyamalan that is) He goes against the grain and you can tell that he's more concerned about making movies with passion instead of Oscars in mind like Spielberg did with MUNICH~ Of course, THE VILLAGE is not just a case of style over substance. There's great entertainment to be found here, entertainment that may not be all that entertaining to today's more youthful audiences whose minds are constantly yearning for sex, excessive violence and Hollywood clichés, but rather a touching love story and some suspense that may just catch you off guard. I'll admit, the big twist at the end is something some people just won't go for, but for some, like myself and many others I know, it will cash in big time and may leave you breathless if you keep yourself vulnerable to it. And (forgive me if I'm being long-winded) but this movie has brains and deserves several viewings for those who will want to find out what Shyamalan's trying to say about human nature.",The Village

The dialog was completely flawless. Every single sentence was written to have meaning. No needless quips or ridiculously written tag-lines, which is VERY rare in American cinema. The way M.

416,IceSkateUpHill,"trilling, intriguing, confusing",5,30 July 2004,"this is an M. Night Shyamalan movie there is no other way of describing it, a word to the wise is to not watch this movie without seeing at least one of this odd mans works.The village is about a town quarantined from the rest of the world due to various reasons that the elders share with the young inhabitants of the village. Everyone has taken a sacred oath not to leave the village because the outside world is not the place to be and if you do leave the village you may come across the creatures that lurk in the surrounding forest. The creatures have had a truce with the villagers and neither steps on the others land but something is about to change.....The story telling is creative, fun, thrilling and keeps you interested but the dialogue is just annoying, it attempts to be the English language of the late 1800's and it did not make much sense. Also sometimes the story leaves you sitting there wondering what the hell is going on and keeps in you in that state of mind for too long, which is a problem because it can lose you.If you have patience and are a fan of M. Night Shyamalan then see this movie 5/10",The Village

I was hoping Signs was just a fluke in how bad it was, but you managed to almost just as bad with the Village.I still love your cinematography. Very beautiful art direction, very much draws the viewer into the ""period"" world that you have created. Your direction and the actors also perform very well and are the last good things about this movie.The fault with this movie, as it was with Signs, is in the screenplay/plot. Now maybe you could just blame high expectations because I would agree that with both movies (after loving both Sixth Sense and Unbreakable) I had very high expectations and couldn't wait to go and see them. But truthfully, in both cases I was expecting to get a Ferrari and all I got was a Tercel. You walk into the Village hoping for at least a scary movie, but I gotta say this movie isn't at all frightful! The creatures when you finally see them are such a major let down! All I will say is that I kept thinking of the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz.And the plot twist I saw coming a mile away! Almost from the beginning when William Hurt is telling the school children in class about ""Those we do not speak of"" I suspected it but I was like nah, Shaymalan can't be that silly with his plot lines. But about 20mins before it was finally revealed I knew for sure, how the rest of the movie was gonna play out and was begging God that I was wrong.

Besides all the internal discontinuities and truly silly plot twist, how the director got all these quite excellent actors to actually speak these empty bombastic lines is quite beyond me. Probably that's where all the budget went. It certainly wasn't the special effects that were limited to creature costumes that looked like they were created by 'goth' teenagers on Quaalude.While the photography was pretty, much of the time the actors were squared up to the screen, acting like crazy right into in camera with the best sincere off-Broadway serious tones that signal that ""Hey, pay attention.

421,Hawley_Griffin,The Village,5,4 September 2004,"OK, so I'm not a big Shyamalan fan. I thought ""The 6th Sense"" was dull. ""Signs"" was more daring and more interesting, but as a whole it amounted to so little I felt cheated. But for some reason I really loved ""Unbreakable"". That's as far as my recognition for his talent goes. Or maybe his stuff just isn't made for me.""The Village"" certainly wasn't made for me. I'm as big of an Ebert hater as you're gonna find, and when I read his one-star review my interest for the movie grew considerably. Sadly, I agree with him. If there is a word that describes ""The Village"" perfectly, it's ""miscalculation"".Miscalculation of what, you ask? Of Shyamalan's talent for creating suspenseful moments? Yes. I understand this is kind of a show-off, ""I'm-so-good-I-can-scare-you-shitless-with-a-ridiculous-guy-in-a-red-cloak"" kind of thing. Well, that failed, at least for me. I found those guys laughable, although I admired the gimmick that was done with them in a scene that involves the forest and a blind girl surrounded by the color red.Miscalculation of the power of the final twist of the movie? Yes, indeed. I know it's his thing. But sometimes when you try to make those ""I-pulled-your-rug"" endings on a great scale, it ends up with a cheated, unsatisfied audience. That would be good if the twist was really clever. Case in point, the most under-appreciated movie ever, ""Femme Fatale"". I was cheated with that movie, but it worked because the surprises made me appreciate what I had seen previously on a different light. This isn't true with ""The Village"". The twist amounts to absolutely nothing and I felt profoundly indifferent towards it.There is someone out there who will love the crap out of ""The Village"". It's not bad to the point where it can't be enjoyed. But it left me as cold and uncaring as I've ever been with a movie.",The Village
422,voxparody,Village Idiocy,2,18 May 2005,"I quickly became a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's films. In ""The Sixth Sense,"" we the audience were not only thrust into the nightmarish world of a nine-year-old boy, but soon realized the boy was actually telling the truth. We also discovered that we were already on the other side of that boy's nightmare. Pretty interesting stuff here, Shyamalan, I will sally forth and buy more tickets to witness your subsequent filmsderivative, yet spooky spectacles that, I presume, will spark my jaded senses for all spectacles celluloid.And, yes, a few more of these spectacles followed.For me ""Unbreakable"" (while still chipped and forgettable) nevertheless kept that spark going.""Signs"" contains a few creepy goosing moments, combining 1980s United Kingdom crop circle-hoax phenomena with 1970s Erich Von Däniken's ""Chariots of the Gods"" crop circle-hoax phenomena I for one 'ate both plates' anyway, as did many other film fans of the outré sect. ""Signs"" also had one final scene in which the respective adult and child had to save themselves from the harmful, outside forces that be (in this case, the traditional sci-fi bug-eyed extraterrestrial creatures that somehow further managed to whet our Shyamalan-film appetites).A few years later, ""The Village"" arrived on billboards and later in theaters... and my curiosity, however diminished, was still intact. This time, however, something gave me a hunch that I should stay home and wait for friends and film critics to empty their pockets before I did.I was right. This one reeked worse than a steaming compost heap.Not long after its DVD release, I paid this rural town a visit and found nobody was home. Sure, this film is filled with the usual oddball denizens seen in other similarly designed fictional burgs: the widow, the widower, the village idiot, the blind girl/vestal virgin with extrasensory sight, and the usual band of foreign-born yahoos (Gaelic, Welsh, Scottish, Australianit matters not which country these actor imports are from...they're stored somewhere in Hollywood or Broadway, kept in suspended animation, thawed and then served to us to further entice our presumed desire for watching classically trained actors fall flat on their faces).But I digress. ""The Village"" tries its best to entice us with that same sense of wonder that had theatergoers clamoring for movies like ""The Sixth Sense"" and, to a lesser degree, the director's subsequent films.I expected more sizzle from 'Village.' Actors Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt are just here as authoritarian figureheads to spark nonexistent yearnings for each other (breadcrumbs to lure the unsuspecting Shyamalan-film fan, no doubt...these actors have seen better days); Adrian Brody will never become Jodie Foster or Sally Field in the way of acting (or even Leonardo de Caprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""), no matter how many Oscars Aidan wins; and I advise Joaquin Phoenix to start looking for another landlord director.Lastly, 'Village' is just one big talcum powder-keg precision-timed to blow up in our faces. See it if you believe all the hype regarding its thoughtful message and all that... I say this 2004 movie was all just a waste of time and DVD-rental money.",The Village
423,Gloryous,The Village lacked momentum- this movie gives new meaning to the blind leading the blind!!,8,14 August 2006,"When I saw the teasers on TV for this movie, it looked like it might be good, even the review of it made it sound like I might like it. I hoped it would be suspenseful and a bit scary.It started out slow, and seemed to continue to be slow to get to the point, I felt at some point I was caught in an Amish town, and the story continued to focus on just everyday things. The town was afraid of something in the woods. The people were scared out of their wits. Sure they were scared of something. I thought I saw Sigmond and the one of the Seamonsters in the forest wearing a Little Red Riding Hood cape. Or maybe something from H.R. Puffnstuff. This movie dragged so badly, and the actors while many are well known, even they could not make this story go any faster. I felt the story was over done, and the plot was so vague, the main character is wounded too soon in the movie, then it became ludicrous that the people sent a sightless person to go get help. I am sure the person who wrote it believed it was a very interesting plot, but for me being able to run it ahead made my day, because if I had had to sit through the entire movie at the show, I would have had to be tied to the chair to keep from getting up and leaving half way through. Make sure when you see this movie that there is a clear pathway to the nearest exit!!I had been superficial in my opinion above, then I slept on the ideas in the movie and the truth of the movie came through to me. There really is a deeper meaning to the story and I did not find it till after I turned it off and thought about it. It is all about people keeping others under control with Fear. The Bible says Fear hath Torment. It is sad to say there are so many people in families and in countries, and businesses that control everyone with Fear. How terrible that these people feel it is the right thing to do. This is what I realized this movie was really about. Maybe the way it was presented was draggy and the movie did not move along as fast as it should have, but the writer of it was trying to set the scene and make people think. I have to admit I laughed at how it was presented, I was wrong, it was a good story, about real things that people do to each other. I just hope others will let the story really sink in, because if it will wake someone one to stop trying to control someone, it will be all worth it. It has a Message. I finally Heard it. I am so glad I did.",The Village
424,john_murdoch2002,"Wow, where to begin",1,6 August 2004,"It's a known fact that M. Night Shyamalan can make some truly scary movies. The Sixth Sense echoed Alfred Hitchcock, a comparison that is not tossed around lightly. Signs was an exercise of letting one's imagination fill in the horrific gaps of what the audience cannot see. But Shyamalan's latest outing dives into a new type of scary: That a filmmaker with such an accomplished resume, two Oscar nominations, and a very profitable background could create a film so bad that the audience would be more likely to find amusement hitting their heads against the seats in front of them in this movie.The plot is sketchy at best, but ""The Village"" is about a village of people in an indeterminate setting have become threatened by mythical creatures in the woods who are beginning to invade the town. Meanwhile, Joaquin Pheonix says that he wants to venture into the woods to find some medicine from the outside towns. Pheonix and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard share moments of fleeting love that is never truly defined. For that matter, neither is any of the characters' motivations. We are essentially watching people go through the actions, but the audience is left in the dark.So essentially, Shyamalan is trying to show the dangers of hiding from one's past, but the story is so disjointed and poorly told that his message and story get lost in the chaos. A few more drafts or at least a ghost writer or two could have saved this story from incoherence, but it seems that Shyamalan saw this as his baby and wanted complete control over it. Since the film is now his own, he becomes the one who is to blame. Shyamalan should have known better.This movie brought to mind an interesting riddle, what's a bigger crime: wasting a talented ensemble cast or framing a movie in a way that disconnects the audience from all attachment to the characters? We have Joaquin Pheonix, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody, William Hurt, Brendan Gleeson and the promise of a newcomer in Bryce Dallas Howard, yet this movie proves that no matter how much talent you may have, if there's no motivation to work with, no clear goals of the characters, and lines so out of place and distractingly bad, talented actors becomes no more than a mannequins for the director to manipulate. Shyamalan should have known better.Obviously, there is a typical twist at the end of an M. Night Shyamalan has become expected, whether it be ""I see dead people"", ""They call me Mr. Glass"", or ""Swing away,"" relying on such twists can be a treat for an audience, but ""The Village proves that relying on twists too much can make the audience realize they are on shaky ground and make them watch every step the movie takes. By Shyamalan's fourth film, the audience already begins to expect such an ending and instead begin looking at clues instead of the film itself, which in the case of ""The Village"" may actually be a good thing, but in this case, the payoff is so juvenile that one expects it from a sixth grade creative writing paper rather than from the man who made us ""keep the secret"" of ""The Sixth Sense."" (You can find the twist in the paragraphs of this review) Shyamalan should have known better.Directors carry most of the blame if the movie they make isn't clear or interesting to an audience and here, Shyamalan is the man to blame. He stages his shots so that we never see any reaction on the characters faces during critical moments in the film. And the staging of each of the actors is so dehumanized and impersonal that it does more to draw an audience away from a film than draw them in. If the atmosphere looks great, one can credit the greatest living director of photography: Roger Deacons and the always talented costume designer Ann Roth. But their efforts seems wasted as the photography or the costumes are never given the chance to breath on their own. Shyamalan should have known better.Although, we could make the argument that Shyamalan needed a more accomplished film editor. People like Andrew Mondshein (The Sixth Sense), Dylan Tichnor (Unbreakable), and Barbara Tulliver (Signs) all knew how to handle Shyamalan's disjointed storylines and add a depth, using the cutaways to reactions. Here, Christopher Tellefsen is satisfied allowing the camera to hold on shots where the characters' backs are talking to the audience, never cutting away to show us reaction shots or giving the film a satisfying pace outside of sterile. If he had stuck with any of the other editors he'd worked with, the film might have worked better, but he chose not to. Shyamalan should have known better.You'd be hard pressed to find an enjoyable moment in this whole film. Watching this movie, one gets the feeling that Shyamalan should have written a few more drafts, made the film more clear, made the characters relatable or at least allow the audience in on their thoughts. For a director who has already displayed his own sixth sense for showing a depth of character (all together now): Shyamalan should have known better.",The Village
425,jlt86,Suffered for Being Advertised Wrong,7,9 March 2011,"I just watched this movie the other day when it was on TV. I saw it in the theater when it came out but I didn't really remember it too well. After watching it for a second time, I realized that it was a pretty good movie with a genuinely interesting plot. In fact, all of M. Night's movies are good (except for The Happening...which is the movie we will not speak of). The problem with all of his films including The Village is that they are advertised wrong. The Village was advertised as a horror movie when in actuality, it's not. Ever since The Sixth Sense, everyone has been expecting M. Night to scare them...but this is not what he does. Most of his movies are fantasy-dramas with engaging stories and characters you come to care about. Although scary, even The Sixth Sense wasn't a horror movie. The Village succeeds on so many levels such as in the set design, atmosphere, characters and twist ending. Everyone needs to give M. Night some credit as a master storyteller and quit criticizing him for not being scary enough. His films are enjoyable when you're willing to enjoy them for what they are.",The Village
426,lochnessmummy,"Once again, this is not a horror movie, it's a philosophy movie",4,1 August 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan's major films are unique, (perhaps not so unique) in that Hollywood keeps marketing them as horror films when they are not.  The Village continues that pattern with a period piece along the lines of Shirley Jackson's The Lottery.If this film doesn't put you to sleep, it will annoy the heck out of you with it's inane ""secrets.""  It touches on some intriguing ideas but never resolves them, and it threatens to scare you but never does.  The only dope in the whole village who does anything is the character of Lucius, and he's a non-participant for the second half of the film.  What a waste.One thing that must be stated:  Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was heartbreakingly wonderful.  I was almost crying for her character at the end.  I would've rated this film with a 1 out of 10, but because of her I put it four points higher.",The Village
427,lochnessmummy,Yet another reason to hate hippies (warning: secrets revealed),4,17 August 2004,"The correct title of this film should be The Commune. 
It's telling that two of the main actors in this movie are William Hurt and Sigorney Weaver --two aging hippies performing characters who live out the flower power ideal.  The Village isn't centered around a turn-of-the-century village, but a contemporary hippie commune, filled with frustrated whimps who are too afraid of death to deal with life.  The main point of the film is that you can't run away from tragedy, yet these spineless folk tune themselves out completely, bringing their clueless children with them.  As a result, they end up with kids who live in mortal fear of ketchup, but seem strangely comforted by mustard.  --and none of this nonsense is scary. Crosby, Stills, and Nash once sang, ""Teach your parents well.""  These grown-ups should be whacked with a paddle.One more thing:  there are no ""monsters"" in this movie.  It's all a lie (in more ways than one).  I thought hollywood had gotten past the stage of resolving the story with, ""it was all a dream.""  Apparently not.  The Village teases us with glimpses of something supernatural, before it totally deflates us with something maddeningly mundane.  What a cop-out.Bryce Dallas Howard though, is this film's saving grace.  Let none of this rant (or the awful movie it scorns) take away from her sublime, heartbreaking, and inspiring performance.  She was wonderful.",The Village
428,papabearEG,the plot twist for me was at the beginning,9,27 August 2006,"I rented this movie thinking it was a cheap horror/thriller flick because my partner loves that kind of tripe. So for me the plot twist was a very pleasant one at the beginning when i became engrossed in the film and realized it was a beautifully crafted drama/suspense. It isn't horror at all and thriller doesn't work, suspense is better for a choice of categories. I found a lot of similarities between this story and Little Red Riding Hood. My partner was dreadfully bored and disappointed. I was enthralled and loved it. Like so many other good movies it was badly marketed (like the Iron Giant). Marketing people in Hollywood need to go back to flipping burgers. I suspect they would be better at it. There was one goof mentioned that has me puzzled. The goof on this site mentions a point where an elder is wearing a more modern suit when they are meeting behind a barn. When I first saw him in that scene I thought so too. Later there was a close up of him and while the tie is modern, the rest of his clothes aren't. I think its more likely that its an intentional foreshadowing element. Or maybe its just a tie.",The Village
429,annaily,A missed opportunity,6,26 August 2018,"I like this movie but it is flawed.Most of the movie is fairly boring and nothing happens. Thats the biggest problem. Its just so...... boring...... I didnt want a horror movie, or even a thriller really, but i did expect it to be at least somewhat tense. This movie did not build tension for me. It did not bring out the performance from the actors that it could have.There are also some problems with the logical consistencies. For one, It's revealed that the monsters are the adults dressing up as them. This is despite the fact that they make extremely non-human monster noises. I mean the gurgling and clicking and snarling and growling is not a noise a human could make, and even the mentally disabled boy makes it when he dresses up as the monster. I suppose its possible the adults are using secret modern technology to make the noises, but the mentally disabled boy doesnt seem to be capable of doing any of that due to what we have already seen and known about him.Also about the mentally disabled boy... At multiple points throughout the film, Noah's freedom from rationality is used as an excuse for twists that have no underlying logic of their own. Second, the big reveal that it is modern day world isnt shocking in the slightest. Its not even creative or original. It just makes you annoyed. The parents (none of them notably religious, mind you) would let their children go blind and die rather than just take a day trip to get some medicine. They could even keep it secret so it cant be explained by them not wanting to reveal the truth to their children. If the point is that they left modern society to protect their children, it makes no sense that they let the boy die in the beginning instead of letting Lucius (or an adult) go get medicine. Thats not very protective, now, is it?Third, what would happen when the elders die and theres no more monsters?Fourth, theres no reason for them to speak in the old-timely dialect and idioms. Being hidden away from society, the elders could talk like normal people, its not like the kids could ever know that the way of speaking is that of a modern technologically advanced society as opposed to a historical one. Why would modern people bother to speak in the village's peculiar, archaic idiom? Because if they spoke like modern people it would tip us off. Modern words are not deleted for the kids' benefits, as there is not real benefit to it, but instead deleted for the audience.Its things like this that make this movie annoying. Shyamalan's need to set up his twists deforms almost everything else in the film. The characters are not speaking to each other, but to us. They are not existing in a logical universe, but one that would deceive an audience. Fifth, If this is the real world, which it is very much implied it is, what is up with blind Ivy's ability to ""see"" auras and to make her way through dense woods unaccompanied? These arent things that exist or could happen in the real world. Its not a bad movie. Its a pretty good movie. But its not NEARLY as good as it could or should have been. It is a missed opportunity. And that makes it infuriating, which really takes a decently good movie and just makes it not worth watching.",The Village

Good initial build-up turned to, ""You gotta be kidding"" when the whole demon thing turned out to be a hoax. Not that I was surprised -- where do demons get paint to put on doors? OK, I can live with no demons, and the alternative is somewhat interesting. BUT ... First, they establish Phoenix as an interesting character, and then abandon him. Second, why would a father send a BLIND daughter off on the trip they send her on? What a bunch of gutless wonders; we're supposed to empathize with this? Then they just toss off the fact that they have a village elder killing and mutilating animals on a large scale. That the girl actually succeeds in the journey strains the imagination. Then, she just lucks into a kind soul who helps her and asks no questions? You have to suspend vast credibility to buy into this. Not to say it isn't interesting, but it's flawed big-time.

Actually, there's a brief description on this site, and I'm not about to give away spoilers, so I'm not even going to even try to describe the plot. Instead, I'll concentrate on describing my opinion of the movie. For starters, anyone who disliked Shyamalan's last three movies (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs) will obviously dislike this one, as well. And anyone (such as myself) who enjoyed the last three, should of course enjoy this one. For those who only enjoyed one or two of them, you're on your own- I have no idea whether or not you'll enjoy The Village.I felt that this was a typical Shyamalan movie: superb direction and acting, tension that you could cut with a knife, and of course, the twist ending. Like the others, it is slow and methodical without ever becoming boring, and is filled with suspense. In my opinion, this one had a better ending than Signs, but it was still not wholly satisfactory (I will say that I was completely fooled).Overall, I'll give it a score of 8/10.",The Village
435,ObsessiveViewer,M. Night Shyamalan Does It AGAIN!!,7,30 July 2004,"*-Catch it on TV **-Worth a Rental ***-Buy it Used/On Sale ****-Buy it New/Top Dollar *****-Worthy of a Blind BuyM. Night Shyamalan has built his career on a simple formula. First, set up the main plot and suspense. Second, have an event that changes the tone of the film and sets it in a new direction. Third, end with a twist that forces the audience to rethink everything they had just seen. This formula has been applied to Shyamalan's past three films and is the foundation of his storytelling. Of course, The Village is no different. The film follows the formula to a tee and is at the same time astounding and original.The Village is about a small community in 1860's Pennsylvania whose citizens live in constant fear of mystical creatures that live in the woods surrounding them. The townspeople have a simple and longlasting agreement with the creatures 'do not to come to our village, we will not come to your woods.' However, when Lucius Hunt takes it upon himself to explore the village's boundaries the creatures decide to explore their own boundaries. The end result is a film that is hardly frightening but all the more shocking. Night adds more twists than in his previous work and even manages to blow all his other films out of the water. As I said before, Night's formula consists of three parts. The second part of his formula, in which there is a shocking moment at the halfway point that changes the tone of the rest of the film, is more present in The Village than ever. The Sixth Sense had the famous, ""I see dead people"" scene. Unbreakable had the weight lifting sequence, and Signs had the Brazilian home video sequence. The moment in The Village that changed the direction of the film was brilliant. I won't elaborate for fear of saying too much but that particular moment had me in a state of shock for a good ten to fifteen minutes. The rest of the film is just as gripping and Shyamalan's signature twist is not quite as genius as The Sixth Sense but is still mind blowing.Signs used the story of an alien invasion as a backdrop to tell the tale of a man regaining his faith in God. The Village is somewhat of a love story at heart, although the love story is not nearly as ""in your face"" as the faith story from Signs. Instead, the love story acts more like a subplot that drives the character's actions. This made the film much more enjoyable than the massively entertaining Signs. Overall, The Village is the fourth consecutive reason why M. Night Shyamalan is one of the the most talented filmmakers around. Night has proved himself as a genius storyteller and I am looking forward to whatever he brings us next. I give it ***** as The Village is the very definition of a ""blind buy"". Undoubtedly, many people will hate it. It is, like his previous works, a love it or hate it kind of film and I happen to be one that loved it.",The Village
436,LakshmiKanth_Vizzu,Perfectly Executed Shyamalan Thriller,8,16 May 2011,"First of all i don't wanna Discuss about the plot and ruin your cinematic experience.. Because ""The less you know about Shyamalan's movie the more you will get thrilled""....So try to go with minimum details of the movie (Shyamalan's movie particularly)...I believe he is one directors that we should have keep our eyes on... I also believe that Mr. M. Night Shyamalan is just like a great magician ,who holds all his tricks and twists within his sleeves , which is called as directorial gimmick.. I still cant forget the Twist in the Sixth Sense ..The village is a Atmospheric Fantasy Mystery thriller , It continues Shyamalan's pattern of there being twists in the plot , But this time there are several twists which will reveal periodically.. Character study is very deep , and realistic ... But don't take it wrong with horror genre (of course it contains horror elements,but not much)Coming to the cast , Bryce Dallas Howard played a role of Ivy Walker , which will be remembered through out the years.. As from my point of view , ""The village"" cant be imagined without her...The rest of the cast is pretty good but Bryce Dallas Howard steals the show..Coming to the plot , It is flawless and good...and picking up irrelevant plot holes is meaningless...""In village"" we can clearly observe that ""How screenplay can effect a movie"".. The story is good , but with perfect screenplay the movie is truly appealing.. The plot has periodical predictable and unpredictable twists which will grip the suspense.....Coming to the the background Score , It is perfect....It helped in maintaining pace of a movie...But don't expect it to be another ""Sixth Sense"" It is very underrated movie , as from my point of view this is the second best in Shyamalan's career...If you have any idea of the true cinematic art or if you believe in it , then ""The Village"" is worth your money...If you didn't get a chance to see it yet, Go see it now..My Rating : 8/10",The Village

Night's films have progressively gotten worse from Sixth Sense. It's too bad, because I think he tries hard. I really didn't care about any of the characters in The Village, because for the most part they weren't three dimensional.

439,ProphetTenebrae,M. Night Shyamalan proves the law of diminishing returns with this snore-a-thon,3,8 August 2004,"Contains Spoilers I've just seen it... I have to say, this film has been aggressively over-hyped to the point where most people will walk out the cinema feeling they must have seen trailers for a different film.M. Night again shows his now established pattern of diminishing returns here - his style of pacing that worked so wonderfully in Sixth Sense, reasonably well in Unbreakable and rather poorly in Signs here is one of the films cardinal flaws. Essentially it takes the film over an hour to actually get to the relevant part - where we discover that, surprise surprise, there are no monsters it was all a big trick.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to think that M. Night's (one should always get worried when a director becomes sufficiently egotistical to prefix a film with his own name) The Village - might as well be called, The Pseudo Amish. I waited the whole film for a buggy... I didn't see one and it would be worth pointing out that this anticipation is about all that kept my eyes on the screen.One should appreciate that this is not a monster film - despite the advertising which makes you think it is. Really, it doesn't even have that much ""monster"" tension at the start. In fact, the first hour of the film doesn't really seem to achieve anything IMO - one doesn't really get that much of a feel for characters or the like, it's just sixty minutes of boredom... and then it's all explained more or less - then there's some more cheap thrills, the origin of the Village is revealed (if you didn't work it out, then you were either asleep or were thinking about whether giant porcupines would be a real danger.) and its over. I guess the twist at the end was - there was no twist.Attempting to trick you into thinking the creatures are real when the blind girl is in the woods seems a bit foolish. As it's really not too hard to guess what it really is but that's about the only part of the film where there's any sense of danger or anything interesting going on. Not to mention that you have to question the insight of sending the blind girl to get the medicine - which seems like a pretty unfair choice, the guy saves his son-in-law while other people have died but that's brushed aside for more tedium.This film is essentially a morality lecture about how our society is so evil, that people are driven to escape it by being a rip-off of the Amish people, enforced by the threat of fictitious monsters, all nicely ringed off and guarded from the outside world somehow. Quite why they didn't just go and join the real Amish or become Mormons or something is beyond me... it would probably have made a more interesting film but then, most things would have.So if you're looking for a monster film, a clever social commentary, something with a twist in the tale, or even a couple of hours entertainment - I humbly suggest you look elsewhere.All in all, a pretty poor effort, in my opinion - 2 out of 5. Let's hope M. Night decides to quit/take a break/ get his act together before he lays another one on us.",The Village
440,Pro_Surfer_14,Unique,10,11 September 2004,"Well M. Night Shyamalan has once again stunned us with his unique film making, this time with THE VILLAGE. This film is so beautifully shot you will be blown away by its power.Joaquin Phoenix is so perfect as Lucius Hunt, he acts with such wit and passion, he puts all his effort into this role ( I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a well deserved Oscar for this ). The storyline is just brilliant and suttle, as most of his other films are eg: The Sixth Sense, and Signs, Though Unbreakable didn't quite make it. As much as I loved this film and all the actors in it, it doesn't quite reach his first films power ( The Sixth Sense ). His first film was quite unreachable, it is so well done that I really don't think a film will reach its standards ever. I believe M. Night will do it again he definitely has the talent in him. Anyway back to 'The Village' Remember how The sixth Sense had a breakthrough actor 'HALEY JOEL OSMENT' his latest film has BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD who is the daughter of the director RON HOWARD. Miss Howard is brilliant and totally convincing as a blind girl 'Ivy Walker'.

Also, do not expect a gore filled ""action thrill ride"", because it is not.Nevertheless, i was VERY positively surprised by this movie. Although slow paced, the story started to really captivate me. The suspense grew, the less we actually see of those ""creatures"", the more eerie the whole story got. About halfway in the movie i was afraid to leave my chair since the movie ""got me"", so to speak, and i didn't want to miss anything.The movie is full of allegories, no doubt about it, and there is a good portion criticism about our society. Think about it what the ""creatures"" actually stand for?The movie is also beautifully shot, with eerie imagery, one of the few movies where certain scenes and images can make a long impression in someone's mind.I also thought that the acting was excellent.The only way i can explain such a low rating is that many of today's movie watchers can't handle a rather slower paced suspense and prefer the (literally) cheap ""horror"" aka ""Paranormal Activity"" over such a movie.

For anyone and everyone who liked this Sixth Sense, strap yourselve's in for another two hour mind bending experience.  Bryce Dallas Howard gives an electric performance, not allowing you one moment to look away.  The film is not a horror movie, as it may have been advertised, but rather a suspense.  On a deeper level the movie gives way to hours of thought on society (I'll stop there for fear of giving anything away.)  The camera work was pure genious, M. Night is truely one of the few remaining directors who appreciates the effect a simple camera move can have on the audience.  The story is delightfully sprinkled with bits of humor here and there, and features not only Howard's fantastic performance, but also a great job by Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.  I would have no problem placing this in the top 3 movies so far this year, and would recommend this film to anyone who is looking to enjoy themselves.  Perhaps the film went over the heads of the general public, or perhaps it will just take some time, but this movie is gold, and eventaully all these nay sayers will realize that.",The Village
445,elsterusa,good movie,8,6 August 2004,"*******************  SPOILERS HEREIN  *****************I saw this movie with pretty low expectations.  I was, once again,pleasantly surprised.  In other reviews, I constantly sawcomplaints about the story being weak.  i disagree.  I found thestory to be genuinely scary and extremely thought-provoking.  Onequestion that I found Shymalan asking us is if it is right to try to livein an utopian world by means of fear and bribery.  I also sawcomplaints about the monsters looking cheap.  Although I did notfind the monster to be thoroughly convincing, it worked.  Besides,the costume was made by humans who, most likely, had no skillin creating bone-chilling monsters.  I had issues with the ""twistending"" since I was expecting something scary instead ofrevealing.  I also had a hard time accepting that the founders of thevillage would make a decision to start again so drastically.  Butthen again, I've never been in the type of situation.  Unlike mostpeople, I had no trouble understanding and accepting thedialogue.  I give the story 7.5/10The acting is what makes the film so good.  Joaquin Phoenix, whoplays the most important character (since he is our hero and isfirst billed), dishes out his usually excellent performance.  Iwouldn't say he was better than he was in Signs, but he was betterthan he was in Gladiator.  Adrien Brody, with a complex role, isalso excellent.  William Hurt deals with the most dialogue in thefilm and talks as if he were meant to talk this way.  SigourneyWeaver was also good, even though I had a tough time acceptingher as a character other than Ripley.  I also had a tough timeaccepting Brendan Gleeson as an American character, but hegave a fine performance nonetheless.  And Judy Greer, as one ofthe Walker daughters, is very good and was, thankfully, able toshow off her acting skills by being something other than comicrelief.  Last, but most definitely not least, is Bryce Howard.  As themain character, she carries the tremendous weight of the moviealmost with ease.  Hers is one of the best performances I've everseen.  None of her lines sound wooden or forced and all of hermovements (which are very important since she plays a blindwoman) are convincing and appear 100% genuine.

446,crueltwistoffate,where's the love?,10,18 January 2005,"There are films that come out that live up to all the hype and leave you with such a lasting impact that your somehow changed by them. The Village is that type of film to. The Village is the 3rd horror/thriller from writer/director M.Night Shyamalan following his mega hit ""Signs"". Well after The Village came out I noticed a strange pattern to Shyamalan's film...he makes the more mainstream film then he follows it up with a more personal artistic thriller that the public never quite gets. Well this pattern was proved correct so far when The Village didn't live up to the hype that was set by Signs. Is that Shyamalan's fault that the average person isn't smart enough to get his more personal artistic thriller? You damn right it is. If this film is too smart for you people then go watch Charlie's Angels or something because your official brain dead.Script wise...God,Shyamalan is my hero here. Not only is he a master story teller but he makes me(a person who really hates dramas) really dig the drama of the film. This isn't your standard thriller, this is a more dramatic classic horror story then a thriller. This film is about characters...not the damn creatures. The creatures serve the plot but...they are NOT the plot. That's important. Here we grow to know the people in the village and understand them and their fears. It's that understanding of the characters that gives the film it's REAL TERROR. If you don't spend time with the characters and get to care about them...then what's the point of putting them in danger when we don't even care. Hollywood makes so many horror movies. They make film after film with stick figure characters that get put through hell that you only really watch to see them die. Here Shyamalan crafts a perfect tale of love and then tests that love put putting it through terror. This film is about humanity and how they are willing to deal with things beyond their control. The characters here are so well written and the story so well played out that you just can't help but to love it. Then there's the spoken words... god, they're so poetic that it's gives the film a real fair tale feel that takes this film to a whole other level. To hear the characters talk is just amazing to hear...it's masterful. I loved hearing every line and I never wanted the film to end. Then I really loved the way the film was structured. This film has it's own of telling it's story and of back tracking so you understand what's going much better. What I also liked was the morals of the film...the Elders of the village started the village to get away from the horror of society but human natured proved that the horror they thought they left behind still found them. It's amazing to watch.Cast wise...Oh my god. Talk about an all star cast. And I just don't mean because they're big name actors...no it's because they're all great actors and bring real class to the film. First you have the star, Bryce Dallas Howard, and I do mean star...not only because she stars in this film, but because she carries this whole film. She's the daughter of former TV star and award wining director Ron Howard...but here Bryce breaks the hold by being a real actress and not just a girl who's trying to act just because her Dad is famous. Here, Bryce brings so much to her role as Ivy Walker that with just a movement of her eyes she can send your heart beating. God, she's an amazing actress and is so natural with the setting.She has this down to earth personality that you really care about and cheer for. Give me an hour and a half with Bryce and you can keep your slutty Lohan and big butt J Lo. I'd rather watch a real actress any day. Joaquin Phoenix is great as always and really under plays his own personality and gives the character of Lucius a real sense of reality that never goes away. Another thing I like is that the actors brought so much to their characters then I'm sure was in the script. Another great surprise was Adrien Brody who plays the ill Noah Percy who through out the film is amazing. At first glance you think he's just playing the village crazy but if you really pay attention you'll see there is more to his craze then what meets the eye. There's a reason why he acts the way he does and when it's revealed...it's amazing.Directing wise...wow.Shyamalan delivers more than I ever thought he could. He delivers a lot of movement to the camera and a voyeur way of shooting that makes us feel more personal with the film. This film is master story telling at it's best. Shyamalan really keeps up the amazing script with an even more amazing way of telling the story. There's there's the SINGLE SHOT scenes that left me in awe. God, talk about amazing. They were done so well that we felt the same danger that many of the characters felt. Not only does he use the camera to tell the story but he also uses every trick in film make it to use it to tell an even better film. There some scenes were everything goes silent and with the film's directing...it impacts you harder.Shyamalan is the first director I've seen to really use sfx to his talent. At the end of the film, I was left with an impact in my deepest core. I LOVE THIS FILM. This film is the type of film I want to make. This film is the bar for me and if I could make a film just half as good then I could die a happy film maker.",The Village
447,Asphyxiod,Excellent,8,24 June 2005,"So just when The Village was released, all of us found mixed reviews & stale comments from leading critics. But after I thoroughly analyzed the logical sense, entertainment & drama which the film delivered, I could conclude that M. Night Shyamalan created a perfect-ten flawless master piece.Shyamalan is simply genius. He creates the mood, ambiance & tension to perfection. He induced us all to be a fan for the Shocking suspense formula from ""The Sixth Sense"" & ""Unbreakable"". He induced (which very few were) to relish the realistic approach of a family drama in ""Signs"". Finally, Shyamalan is one of the finest director in Hollwood, as a revolutionist he needs to be respected & applauded.""The Village"" tells us a story about a small Isolated village in the 16th Century surrounded by Forest. The Villagers are somewhat self-sufficient for their daily needs. There exists a strong bond of love & respect among themselves. The group of Elders have always kept motivated the Youngsters with ethical values & traditions. Anyone watching the movie, to some extent shall get mesmerized with the vintage lifestyle of these Villagers who are intimate with nature. The Artificial Modern Day life of today have deprived us from the real luxury of living in Nature. This Villagers don't have fear for anything as they are void of monetary needs, ego, greed and over-ambitious desires. But there's one fear stays within them, always. There lives Some Strange Creatures in the Forest which surrounds them. There always was a Peace maintained between the Villagers & the Creatures that none of them shall cross each other's boundaries. The Problem begins when a Young man named Lucius Hunt, tries to cross the Borders for a possible attempt to reach nearby towns for procuring vital medicines. Lucius unlike any young man was courageous and in love with Ivy, a blind Girl and daughter of Chief Senior of the Village, Edward Walker.The Elders always strongly opposed the Villagers for any attempt to cross the borders and maintained that practice as an oath.The Drama begins here as Shyamalan creates the Fear. The Direction is laid in a way that we become part of the Village. We start adoring the bond between Lucius & Ivy. Just then Lucius is badly injured by Noah, a mentally weak friend of Ivy who becomes jealous for Ivy's love for Lucius. Here is the need of medicine which can save the life of Lucius. Walker the prime supporter of their oath, had to decide for allowing Ivy to cross the Borders to get medicine. His life was important as Lucius had those leadership qualities who could be the future leader to maintain those rules, custom & traditions which the village always followed. He was the best suitable person to whom the ultimate secret could have been revealed.The Script is marvelously written and told. It gave full justice to all characters. And of course the Twist at the end is as shocking as The Sixth Sense & Undreakable.",The Village
448,igm,The Village Idiots,8,10 August 2004,"Shyamalan is quite adept at packaging big, existential questions into thrillers. I know I'm in the minority, but I really enjoyed Signs. In a classic bait-and-switch, Shyamalan lures you into the theatre to watch a creature feature, but winds up exploring the nature of faith, and how a man wounded by love's loss, a man of the cloth, recaptures his faith in God. The creatures were a significant letdown, and could quite possibly have been avoided entirely, but that's another story.Back to The Village. I enjoyed this film too. I kept searching for allegorical correlation with contemporary politics. I thought in the early part of the film that the villagers were meant to represent Americans. I thought that their illusory boundary with the forest, and the menace beyond it, was meant to represent the illusory secure perimeter of the nation, and the terrorist threat beyond. That the 'warnings'--small, shaved and gutted animals--corresponded to terrorist incursions on American soil. The allegory was holding up pretty well. But as the story continued to unfold, the symbols started to fall apart and the true themes began to emerge. The film is a meditation on courage and love. There's a line in the movie that goes something like, ""We sometimes avoid doing that which we most wish to do so others may not know our desires."" The line is spoken by Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) to Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) and addresses Lucius' reserve and withdrawal from Ivy at the moment his love for her began to swell. The remark opens Lucius' eyes to the unspoken love between his widowed mother (Sigourney Weaver) and Ivy's wedded father (William Hurt). Lucius interposes himself between the invaders and Ivy, and is spurred to confess his love to Ivy and propose. Ultimately, Ivy is called upon to face the menace in the woods in a similar show of love.The maddening thing about the story is the Elder Council, the aforementioned idiots. We learn the true nature of the threat to the community, and it comes from within. It is the elders' fear and disengagement--a sentiment paralleled in the relationship between Lucius' and Ivy's parents, members of the Council--that leads to the Village's vulnerability. And the really maddening thing is that the prevaricators prevail, turning tragedy to their ends.A Hollywood movie without a happy ending. How refreshing.I liked Shyamalan's clever insertion of himself into the movie, a la Hitchcock, via over the shoulder shots and a reflection in a glass cabinet door. The film production if beautiful. The dialog is sometimes stilted, especially when uttered almost robotically by William Hurt. The mediocre dialog and creature design are internally consistent deficiencies in the film. You'll know what I mean once you've seen it. Mostly, the film works. Eight of ten.",The Village
449,Larry-115,Shyamalan's odd-numbered films are great (spoiler-free),9,5 August 2004,"And ""The Village"" is an even-numbered film.  Not to say that ""The Village"" and ""Unbreakable"" aren't good movies, but they aren't up to the caliber of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs.""  It's not coincidental that their box office performance bear this out.That said, ""The Village"" is a good movie.  It's well acted, beautifully filmed, and directed with the solid virtuosity we've come to expect from M. Night Shyamalan.  Besides his plot twists (more on this later), Shyamalan's trademark is his ability to set the right mood for genuine terror in the aisles.  And he delivers in this movie.  As with all his thrillers, excellent character development has a lot to do with this.  Shyamalan is often accused, wrongly, of delivering B-movie horror thrills, but in fact he does exactly the opposite, as B-movie thrills aren't very thrilling at all. If you don't care about a character, you don't fear for the character, and you care about his characters.  When Ivy is in peril, you are terrified for her.  (Howard is terrific as Ivy.)  Shyamalan also knows how to frame an image that is so primordially scary that you feel the fear no matter how much you tell yourself it's just a movie, like Graham in the cornfield at night in ""Signs.""Another hallmark of M. Night's movies are sillinesses that you just have to get over to enjoy the picture.  And there is a lot to enjoy once you do, but you have to get through that shell of plot contrivance.  You have to believe that an adult male child psychologist will approach a child patient for the first time walking down the street alone.  You have to accept the fact that aliens who can travel from other planets can't get through a wood door barred with a shovel.  But if you can put yourself off skeptic-mode and not sweat the small stuff, you will be riveted.  (And if you can't, there's no way you could have enjoyed Star Wars or Raiders of the Lost Ark, for instance.)  This is true of all of his movies, and it's true here too.  Just relax -- it's worth it.The big problem with The Village are the twists.  I won't reveal what they are, but there are two here, and while they are sufficiently effective to move the story along, they aren't particularly moving or unsettling.  In fact, they are a bit flat (even predictable).  One in particular is considered by many to be very silly, but I think that's a little ironic, considering that it's not nearly as far-fetched as the idea of the existence of superheroes, the idea of an alien invasion or a supposed ability to see ghosts.That said, movies are for keeping your attention and interest in the theater, and this one will definitely do that, trust me.  I look forward to the next odd-numbered movie, though.",The Village
450,Troubleboy,A Director Riding on One Hit,2,27 December 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan is the perfect Hollywood example of the one-hit wonder that Hollywood keeps pouring more money into in the hope lightning will strike a second time. Luckily for M. or Night or whatever it is, he left this drek and 'Signs' and 'Unbreakable' as his most recent offerings, otherwise 'The Sixth Sense' would never have have seen the light of day.Without going into the plot, which is basically 'we have seen the world and it is bad, so let's hide out in our houses until, say, the second coming.' Followed by 'oops, somebody's breeched the perimeter' Kind of like in 'Children of the Corn' and fifty other films since the days of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing.

452,mifamily6,"I liked it, so you don't have to",8,22 August 2004,"I saw The Village and really liked it.  Sure, M. Night Shayamalan is really indulgent when it comes to zooming out or slowly panning this way and that way.  But everything in the movie was so atmospheric.  Bryce Dallas Howard was pretty good but most of the time she didn't act like she was blind.  I think I liked her for that.  The last thing we need is for someone to swing their head from side to side and make it ridiculous.  Nothing was really boring about it.  I was in it the whole way through.  Overall, a decent movie.  And for all you Shayamalan haters out there, not so much as a surprise ending as there's just something revealed (WHICH MADE EVERYTHING ELSE BETTER!!)  8/10",The Village
453,UltramarineX,"To put it simply, I was disappointed",5,17 August 2004,"**Warning: Spoilers ahead**     There's no easy way to sugar coat this so I'm just going to come right out and say it.  Out of all the movies I have seen by M. Night Shyamalan, The Village is without a doubt the weakest one he has made, and one of the biggest disappointments of the summer.  Maybe my expectations were too high after seeing Shyamalan's last movie Signs.  At the time, I thought Signs was his best work to date, and I couldn't wait to see what he came up with next. Or maybe I was expecting something from the movie that it had no intention of delivering.  I wanted a movie as creepy as Signs, but instead I got a movie that was, at times, tedious.  In the end though, I just can't recommend The Village.    The premise of the movie centres on a close knit community who lives in the daily knowledge of dangerous creatures surrounding their village.  Some critics (like Roger Ebert) have labeled the story as `hokey', but I don't think it's any hokier than some of Shyamalan's previous movies which deals with the undead, superheroes, and an alien invasion (which some of these same critics liked).  My problem with the movie doesn't have anything to do with the premise itself, but with its execution.  Signs was a movie that continuously had a sense of dread; that something simply felt amiss.  We get none of that in The Village.       Yes we get a few jolts once in a while, but in between we often get some pointless rambling about how the village should be run, that everyone has to bury anything with the `bad colour', and to not be afraid of `Those We Don't Speak Of', which brings me to my next point.  Why do they call it the `bad colour' and not simply red, or `Those We Don't Speak Of' the creatures in the woods (or something like that).  Will saying red somehow call the creatures forth from the woods?  I'd like to know, but Shyamalan doesn't seem to care enough to explain.  Now don't get me wrong, I love movies with a lot of dialogue, just as long as its not worthless talking. Maybe he added those terms (bad colour, etc.) into the movie to make it seem more intelligent', but in my opinion without explaining the reasoning behind those and other terms it just seems pointless and stupid.     The revelation about what the creatures truly were in the movie was a little disappointing.  I won't divulge what the revelation was, but I will say that I couldn't help but feel somewhat cheated, but I was willing to accept it in the hopes that the ending would prove to be interesting.  Ah yesthe ending.  The signature twist ending that is the hallmark of Shyamalan's movies.  I thought the ending was great in The Sixth Sense, okay in Unbreakable, andnot so good in Signs.  Don't worry I won't reveal what the ending was, but only say that I had mixed feelings about.  It was definitely something I had NO idea was coming, and this was both its strength and weakness.  I like unexpected endings such as that in The Sixth Sense, but the ending in The Village was over the top (which is something I know many will disagree with) and, to be honest, unnecessary.     On the other hand the acting in The Village was, on the whole, solid. The most notable standouts were Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard. Phoenix plays the quiet Lucius Hunt.  It was hilarious to watch one of the village girls profess her love for him, and watching him stand there with a deadpan expression on his face.  Howard plays a blind villager named Ivy Walker.  I immediately developed sympathy for her having to live the way she does, but she shows great fortitude throughout the movie, and it shows when should stood terrified outside of her house waiting for Lucius during an attack by the creatures, but never running away.     M. Night Shyamalan is a director who his loaded with talent.  But even the greatest directors will once in a rare while make a movie that is not up to the standards of their previous works.  For Shyamalan The Village would be this movie.  I also think that it's a wake up call for him, that he needs to start changing his twist ending shtick.  I know that pretty much every movie watcher will expect some kind of payoff at the end when watching his movies, but it's starting to get really old, really fast.  I still want to see what Shyamalan does for his next movie, but my expectations won't be so high the next time around.  I give The Village a 5 out of 10.",The Village
454,DEREKFLINT,SHYAMALAN SCORES AGAIN!,10,3 August 2004,"I went to see THE BOURNE SUPREMACY and got a major headache from trying to make sense of the ""dizzy-cam"" filming, which seems to be the vogue now,of the action sequences. Likewise, I ROBOT, with the automatons - on-crack bouncing off the walls while Will ""Too Cool For This World"" Smith single-handedly beats the nuts and bolts out of them. Appearantly he has super-peripheral vison as well because he can keep track of all 50 of them coming at him at once.  I digress. THE VILLAGE, like M. Night Shyamalan's other films, returns to a kinder, gentler time of filmmaking when the viewer could actually be drawn into a story at a normal pace, with character development, beautiful and lush orchestration and a gripping drama that picks up the pace as it goes along. About the first 2 movies I mentioned - I liked them, but found them forgettable 20 minutes after I left the theatre. About THE VILLAGE - it's the kind of movie experience that only comes along once in a blue moon, or at least when Mr. Shyamalan puts a film out. I give it a 10+++",The Village
455,fightingamish00,By far the worst Shyamalan Movie ever!!!!,3,21 January 2005,"I'm a huge fan of Shyamalan's movies for several reasons: 1) There is normally a twist that no one can figure out and if they claim to have it figured out they are lying 2) There is always a ""creepy"" element 3) His wonderful visual and sound effects 4) Normally a great script with good pace and great acting After seeing this movie, it's hard not to see that he failed miserably in the first 2 categories and really only got half of the 3rd category complete (the visual was magnificent but the sound effects are barely noticeable). The 4th category he only had some great acting performances (Brody, Howard and Phoenix) but the rest of the cast was average at best and the script and pace was terrible!!!! I couldn't believe that this was a movie from the same guy who made 6th Sense and Signs.So where do I begin? First of all, I actually figured this one out halfway through the movie. Maybe it's b/c I've seen his movies and I knew there would be a twist, but really, you should be ashamed if you couldn't figure this one out after William Hurt shows Howard the Hidden Shack. I'm easily fooled by these things and if I could figure this out, well I gotta believe over half the people that saw this can figure it out halfway through.Next, there was no ""creepy"" factor in this at all!!!! At no point was I scared or freaked out. The pace of the movie is too slow and the story just takes too long to develop. Which is maybe why I was able to figure this out; I wasn't creeped out or into the movie so I had time to figure out what the big twist was.As I said before there was some good visual elements to this movie but the sound effects here were barely noticeable. I don't ever remember feeling intensely creeped out at any point and I believe his lack of using good sound effects (e.g. his use of the Wind Chimes in Signs) was the reason. And once again, the slow pace of the movie didn't help along with the fact that there are some uncharacteristically stupid moments throughout the movie (e.g. Why does Brody's character put on the costume when he knows Howard is blind?).As a person who doesn't really like scary movies, I became a fan of Shyamalan's b/c most of his movies creep you out in original and unusual ways unlike most scary movies. Now I realize, his movies aren't worth a crap if you aren't freaked out, and this movie isn't worth a crap. Sorry, go see one of his other films if you want to be scared. It only avoids getting a 1/10 b/c of Phoenix's and Howard's performances and some of the visual effects are great, but not worth going to see. 3/10",The Village
456,edblask04,Seemed very boring to me (big spoilers),5,3 August 2004,This movie seemed very boring to me. I could see most of the twists coming long before they showed up except for the last one which just made me think how cruel some humans could be to other humans if this Truman Show like twist were true?  And the monsters? What was that? I think that M. Night Shyamalan saw the Pact of the Wolf too many times as that monster from 18th 17th ? Century France was far more creative than the Village's monster. This movie seemed more like a homage to far better movies like the Truman Show and the Pact of the Wolf. It hardly reaches his creativity in the Sixth Sense or even Signs. More like the yawn producing Unbreakable.The acting was good though especially the new actress playing the lead and Adrian Brody. The best thing you can say about this movie is the acting is quite good when compared with other summer blockbuster blood fests.5 out of 10 stars,The Village

458,foxx_1,"Slow, pretentious, disappointing...",2,25 February 2005,"The opening sequences were quite promising: sombre musical score coupled with slow moving shots of misty tree branches... OK, not very original but convincing. The opening scene adds up more expectations: a funeral of a 7 year old boy, the tombstone telling us exactly the year being 1897. Was he killed by the creatures, the viewer might wonder as during the wake following the funeral distant howling is heard coming from the woods, causing everyone present - except an obviously insane person - to adopt a serious and worried look on their faces. And then... We are confronted right away with Shyamalan's obvious obsession with the color red: while focusing subtly on it in ""The 6th sense"" was intriguing, reusing it in this film with a vengeance means that there is simply a lack of imagination on his side. So we are treated duly with close ups of a red flower, red berries etc. while being told through the movie's protagonists that this is the ""bad"" color (for those who don't get it otherwise...) For no apparent reason, we witness a lengthy scene where a minor female character professes her love for Lucius Hunt (one of the major male characters, simply discarded in the second half of the movie) - only to be followed by another lengthy scene of a lullaby for the brokenhearted. This simply cannot be considered as a buildup of any kind but just as a filler - unfortunately, the same can be said about dozens and dozens of scenes that follow, containing pointless small talk in strange English which for sure was not used around 1897 (just look up some contemporary literature or newspaper article from that period). So we see them (i.e. the villagers) talk in a green house, talk in a hall, talk at a wedding, talk outside, talk inside, talk, talk, talk... Of course, after a while I couldn't help looking at the DVD display to see how much of the movie is left. And it even gets worse: through this constant chit-chat we learn that the creatures (called for no apparent reason ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" - still better than ""Those Who Are Hiding In The Woods And We Speak Of But Never Admit To"") made an agreement with the village folks not to step over the imaginary border - which would keep everyone wondering how this deal was struck. And on top of that, these creatures seem to be quite good fellas actually - they seem to recognize the fact that the mentally challenged character (played by Adrian Brody) has a pure and innocent heart so they don't harm him at all even if he does enter into their territory - or that's what we are told at least. At the same time, the local children are afraid to death to even stand near the border (as it is shown in one sequence) - which implies that their hearts are neither innocent nor pure so they will be justly killed by the creatures with unique and keen understanding of the human soul. Anyhow, at one point the wood inhabitants seem to be pretty upset by the behavior of the villagers although the latter have not done anything so unusual to provoke them - and that's when the going gets tough: the village gets invaded by one (yes, I am not kidding) creature which is enough to make everyone hide in their basements (!?!). The normal question that will pop up in everyone's mind is: are the villagers actually a hybrid between chicken and human or what? Back then people in villages like that usually kept rifles in their houses - and if they did not have rifles for whatever reason, then what about axes, scythes, pitchforks etc.? But it turns out that the creatures are just out for fun and into some kind of Helloween rituals: they just walk around the village and don't break anything nor do they harm anyone. I guess they should have at least thrown around some toilet paper in return for not getting any candy. After this raid, being so scary and devastating, the villagers seem to be scared stupid - so when Lucius is stabbed by the aforementioned mentally handicapped one, no one dares to even think of crossing the woods to go to ""the towns"" to get medicine. And of course, why - what if a creature jumps in front of you and goes ""booh""? So why not send a blind girl to go through the forest she has never entered before so that she can go to a town she has never been to so that she can get some medicine she has never heard of? It's a piece of cake, right?? To make things simpler, the blind girl is not given any money either - I guess, the ""village"" despises it as source of all evil... surely there will be a kind soul out there having pity on a blind girl in a muddy dress asking for some life saving medicine! By the time the ""secret"" of the scary creatures gets lifted, I was bored enough not to bother who the h*ck they are. Same applies to the second ""twist"" - I admit I did not expect it since the year was clearly shown in the beginning but so much the worse if Shyamalan is using tricks like that to poke the viewer with a ""gotcha"" grin on his face - I would just call this cheap cheating.I am sure though that if Shyamalan had delivered the suspense and chills the audience expected, they would have forgiven him for being fooled like that. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen either: the creatures turn out to be a ""farce"" as William Hurt's character poignantly admits - too bad this revelation applies to the whole movie as well.",The Village
459,The_Sandheaver,Good Actors. Superb Suspense. Bad Twist,6,9 February 2006,"This film had the recipes of what makes a good horror film. I am a big fan of M. Night Shayamalan's films, and I was really looking forward to this film. Shayamalan's tale boasts an impressive range of actors, an incredible build-up of tension and suspense, but it's key failure was its twist ending, which both shocks and disappoints.The tale is about an old village (17th/18th Century) and the people who live in it, all of them living in perpetual fear of a strange being that lives in the woods that surrounds them. They are apparently attracted by the colour Red, they seem to have some sort of truce with the town elders, and now, they are intent on breaking their truce because 'they are coming'.The film focuses on Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), a shy yet confident man who shows resilience to the mysterious creatures that live in the woods, and his relationship with a blind woman called Ivy (Howard) who admires this courage. Ivy is also a friend of a bewildered and possibly mentally ill man called Noah (Brody) who has some sort of obsession with Ivy. As the film goes on, Lucius starts to break more and more of the bounds that separate the creatures from the humans, and now, the creatures suddenly seem more active, and it seems that Lucius is to blame. Soon, the fate of the Village is anybody's guess.This film boasts some superb acting. Joaquin is fantastic as the reclusive and gentlemanly Lucius, whilst Adrien Brody is spot on as the psychotic and unpredictable Noah. Meanwhile, Sigourney Weaver, who plays one of the town's elders, gives one of her best acting turns since 'The Ice Storm'. They are all unfortunately hampered by the bad twist, but you could forgive it for the way it builds up the suspense. It is not a bad film, it is perfectly enjoyable to watch once or twice, but it isn't one of those films you'd want to get up and watch obsessively.",The Village

And as usual there are whinges about the twist and how it is a cheat. It's not a cheat if there's no contradiction. The comments I've read here seem to have ignored the deeply spiritual/religious side of all Shyamalan's work, and that is to the fore here. If you have not seen this movie and wish to be surprised by it, do not read the following sentence: The Village is like The Truman Show, but with Christof inside the bubble.

   Where many reviews focus on the plot and its various elements, this one will competely ignore the plot and focus on the Artistic elements of the film.   As usual, M. Night  Shyamalan provides a very well-crafted setting for his story.  On a fundamental level, there is nothing out of place or odd. However, that is this films greatest flaw.  A society completely isolated, which has been around long enough for children to be born and raised, and there isABSOLUTELY nothing unique to this village other than the prohibition againstthe color Red.  Limiting the set and costume design by dropping a color is a nice touch, but there isn't much story behind it.  On a political level, the society is as communal as they could possibly make it....very Red if you follow political color schemes.   In short, Shyamalan's greatest asset in his film-making has always been his eye for detail, color, and visual ploys/plays.  It just doesn't happen in The Village.  It is lack-luster at best.   Music is bland, cinematography isunimpressive.  Costume Design and Set Design is at the level of a badly funded stage play.     Take all of this and combine it with an unimaginative scrupt and you getnothing special.   On to Acting:    Joaquin Phoenix does an effective enough job, but it is not up to his usual standards.  He seems less than interested with the world thatShyamalan gives him, which I blame the director for more than the actor. Adrien Brody does an exquisite job playing Noah Percy.  The characterilluminates a drab screen and ands interest and intrigue. The true gem of this film is Bryce Dallas Howard.   Her character is vibrant, well-acted, interesting and commanding.   She pulls out of the script aperformance that was frankly better than this film deserved.    Expect her to thunder onto the Hollywood main-stage as soon as she gets a role worthplaying.Her performance, along with Adrien Brody, help keep this film from being adismal failure.  Add to it an acceptable, visual concept, and you get a 4 out of 10.",The Village
462,doughelo,Half-hour plot crammed into two hours,4,26 April 2005,"This was well-filmed and decently acted, but there's not enough there there. M Night is a good cinematographer and knows how to set up suspense, but he should have put more complexity into the story. The plot twist is not terribly surprising and less clever than his previous films, even ""Unwatchable"" (sorry, ""Unbreakable""). It's really only enough for a Twilight Zone plot, probably because it pretty much WAS one - the episode with Cliff Robertson in a wagon train where he sets off to get medicine for his sick boy. He inadvertently crosses into the modern world and returns to his time with the magic medicine (penicillin). Except for the time travel aspect, that's pretty much what happens in the Village.A few other problems - a settlement completely isolated from the outside, yet with absolutely immaculate, finely finished clothing, housing and furniture (they've been there at least 18 years, remember); almost no sign of crops; a seeming abundance of leisure time and no shots of anyone working in the fields or at looms, even though constant, grinding labor would be needed to support that many people. I fail to see why the Federal government would accept a bribe to keep flight paths away from the area (no one's ever strayed over it?). None of the young men in town have ever tried to fight one of the creatures, and no one's ever seen the elders heading into the woods with an outfit tucked into their arms? No one's ever stumbled across one of the outfits? William Hurt mentions the elders made the creepy sounds from the woods, but never says how - a solar-powered recording? Not to mention the morality of forcibly holding your children ignorant and superstitious. There are far easier ways of maintaining a sanctuary while still being aware of the outside world. And obviously the experiment failed, as they were not able to shut out passions and crime.",The Village
463,mezaco,A terrible disappointment from M. Overrated Shyamalan.,4,19 February 2005,"A highly disappointing effort by America's most overrated filmmaker, M. Night Shyamalan.Set in a sombre 19th century village, the dialogue is ridiculous and unintentionally hilarious. (eg: in this town you'd say ""It is with your person that I must converse"" instead of ""I need to speak with you"" etc.) All the clichés are there in the open, from the village retard to the mysterious blind girl (who incidentally can walk and run faster and straighter than anyone else and always seems to knows who's in the room with her, etc.).Once you get past everyone trudging around the grimy little town speaking their ridiculous, badly scripted lines, you then sit and wait for the scary moments. And you wait. And you wait.Oh, and yes. This being a Shyamalan film, you're guaranteed of two things: 1. Shyamalan will make a cameo appearance. And once again, his acting skills will prove to be utterly horrific. 2. Yes, there will be a twist. At first, I was impressed with the twist. But when it's over, you end up feeling really cheated. Like you were dragged through the mud for nothing.This film aims for a spooky, chilling feel. And it could have been so much more. Strange creatures lurking in a dark, misty forest? That's a scary enough thought, and it could have made for a really spooky film. But with the horrible scriptwriting, the terrible dialogue and ridiculous twist, it ends up as a wasted exercise.",The Village
464,shervinv,"Good film, but...",8,9 August 2004,"There is much to recommend about this film.  It is beautifully shot, and has several very thrilling scenes.  The acting is very good, especially by Adrian Brody (sp?) and William Hurt (I think his best).  The story is really interesting, but I figured out the plot halfway through, at which time the suspense really dies off.  Do yourself a favor, don't read too many revealing reviews.  Having read a bit, I knew not to expect a horror, but I can see why people who went to see a horror would give this film a bad review.  I think the previews were misleading and hurtful to the film, afterall, horror fans aren't looking for a cerebral slow developing film, which this is, and will surely be disappointed.  I find what you think about a film has a lot to do with what you expect when you go in.  See this film expecting a cerebral thriller, with powerfully presented social commentary (none of which is anything new though, I'd say rather cliche...).  So.. what's this movie about? A couple of things:Pure love is the most powerfully moving force in the universe, The ugliness and greed of modern society and it's disconnect with the pure human values and emotions, The impossibility of running away from the above...:)",The Village

It was extremely boring at times, and the lack of characterisation spoilt the roles. The acting was decent, but I wouldn't recommend this movie, to anyone. Very disappointing. But not terrible! Sometimes the movie could be interesting but ultimately didn't really have me scared or spooked or freaked out. The monster's looked almost comical at parts, with their big red capes and bony structure. This movie just give's people a reason to spoof it. Not terrible, just not great. If in need for a good horror and a thriller movie rent something a little more thought out and intelligent. Not terrible, just not great. 4/10.",The Village

It hit on both, at the same time did not slam-dunk either. The performance of new arrival Bryce Howard was a very pleasant surprise, with a strong hold on her character and few slips. William Hurt delivers yet again another great performance along with Joaquin Phoenix, Sigourney Weaver and a very exciting surprise performance by Adrien Brody. Giving Credit where it is due, the story that Shyamalan spins is exciting and very alluring. The scar factor of this film is OK with some screams throughout the theatre and people jumping. Unfortunately, for the veteran movie viewer, The Village is somewhat predictable and towards the middle of the film, I caught myself anticipating the next turn. Overall, the film delivers for the most part on it advertising but is clearly the next step for Shyamalan.",The Village
467,DamienWasHere,Lifetime Television for Women? Yes. Blockbuster? No.,3,1 August 2004,"I'm going to try to do this without any spoilers...but be warned that my critique alone might lead one to conclusions.My primary gripe about this movie is that it plays like a Lifetime Television For Women flick -- something akin to COLD MOUNTAIN without the budget and WITNESS without the awesome story -- and throw in a little ALIEN for Sigourney's sake.Keep these things in mind and reflect upon them AFTER you've seen the film. You'll see what I mean.1) What was the purpose of the Pilgrim-esquire grammar and manners? Even when Ivy learns the truth from her father, why does he still use that silly, proper, Amishy cadence? And when the elders speak amongst themselves, why do they not revert to normal phrasing? It would have been a cagey hint wouldn't it? Isn't that what plot twists are all about -- the oh-so-subtle hints?2) Adrien Brody does an annoying job of over-acting. I know it's hard to find a real village idiot who also happens to be an acting coach, but he really should have toned it down. Even an idiot would have known that.3) Making Ivy blind was a cop-out. The old, ""hysterical blind person stumbling through the lonely woods"" thing is pretty tired. I imagine this was an attempt to offer us a sense of claustrophobia ( something the director did fabulously in SIGNS) but it just doesn't work here.4) The pay-off, not that there is one, is feeble and forced. By the time Ivy dispatches one of the unspeakables, anyone with a brain has an idea what is going to happen -- but you still wonder if there might be something less overt. I sat there and thought of at least three different twisty, awesome possibilities that might lie ahead to delight us -- but alas, there were none to be found.If I saw this film on The USA Network or Lifetime, I would have thought it was pretty good, but since I've been seeing trailers for this big-budget, summer blockbuster for nearly a year, I was profoundly frustrated.Much like the character's life choices in the village of Covington, the whole thing was a noble effort. So, instead of signing off with a nasty poke at the director/writer, I'll politely say, night, Night.Damien",The Village

It's a movie where you must pay attention to every detail, becasue if you don't you won't get the full affect of the film. The film started off slow but it soon got more intense. The acting is very good and the environment can give you chills. I knew many people that said the movie was boring and/or stupid.

The general idea of the movie itself could not be more boring. The fact that the most action happens when the camera does a cheap shot of a rocking chair should speak solemnly for itself. The ""creature"" we are trained to be fearful of is less intimidating than Rex from Toy Story. I have never seen a film and actually wished I was trapped within a coffin of spiders (my biggest fear) as opposed to watching the television. If you are questioning seeing the film because it looks ""fearful and intriguing,"" you are incorrect. It is fearless and uninteresting. I wish I would not have wasted perfectly good money on it. The acting of the production could be topped by high school students in a poor production of Hello Dolly. I was unbelievably disappointed. I really wanted this film to be good, and the plot line made it sound absolutely fascinating. I was wrong. I will never see this film again, and if a friend ever decides to watch this production, I will lay myself upon train tracks to prevent them from doing so.

I felt a lack of depth, ie - I thought a lot more could have been done with this storyline to make it more powerfully thrilling.I also thought the filming was very good, it really makes you believe in the atmosphere.

It's got a one-note, unbelievable premise that would barely hold up a half-hour episode of ""The Twilight Zone."" (Actually, episodes of ""The Twilight Zone were far more clever than this movie.) It's got a horrid script featuring no lines spoken with prepositions, plot twists that could be guessed from a million miles away. To top it all off, the movie's not even scary. Not at all. The ad campaign, which makes this look like it's a HORROR movie about MONSTERS, is completely misleading. A better movie could be made of this premise if the movie didn't insist on keeping the whole premise a secret. A better movie could be made of this premise if it didn't insist on being so dark, bleak and falsely suspenseful.
The way it's written, the actors are given little to do. The characters have little life, no charisma with one another and feature no one among them who is individual enough to care about. Don't see ""The Village."" There is little worth watching in it.",The Village

Night's last four films... but even with that, his latest tale is an engrossing, well acted picture.Yes, there is a twist and no it is not that good of one, but to me, basing the whole film on the twist is a crime.  This time M creates a LOVE STORY.  While love has been at the root of his previous four flicks as well, this understated romance is far more moving than it's predecessors.  Joaquin Phoenix, as the stoic Lucius Hunt and new comer Bryce Dallas Howard as the breathtaking Ivy Walker create such a powerful bond of young love that this movie becomes a pleasure to watch.Add in the other great performances, the BEAUTIFUL camera work, some political questions and a few (and i do mean few) scares and you've got a movie that is far better than most.  So no, the village is not as good as i would have hoped... but it's still pretty damn good.(for anyone who remembers the scene in Last of the Mohicans when the younger sister jumps off the cliff... it's that kind of love.  Bryce Howard, daughter of Ron, is going to be a star... a very big star.)",The Village

Yeah sure this movie isn't very scary and the monsters don't look amazing but that doesn't make this movie any less enjoyable. Bryce Dallas Howard was simply amazing and this movie was perfect for her. Sigourney Weaver is my all time favourite actress. 1. because shes beautiful 2. because shes a brilliant actress. 3. because she stared in the best film ever made (alien). 4. Oh god i just love her, shes sooooo amazing. The one thing i didn't like about it is that the town elders sounded a bit evil making up the creatures like that. Still they were trying to protect the villagers from the outside world. I would love to live there as long as Weaver lives there. It seems so peaceful and quiet, the setting is brilliant. Lady in the water is my second favourite Shyalmalan followed by signs ... i have sadly not seen the sixth sense of unbreakable yet nut i hope i can see then soon. The Village has quickly become my 8th favourite movie with lady in the water one place above it at 9th. I hope Shamalan continues to make brilliant masterpieces.If you enjoyed this review look out for my review of Lady In The Water",The Village

The acting was good. The idea was great. The only thing I can think of wrong with this movie was Lucius. Joaquin Phoenix did a great job with the role he was cast in, but there was something not quite right about that character. Lucius was a little too creepy. I wasn't buying the idea that the cute young girl was digging him in the beginning. It just didn't add up. It's disappointing when a movie with such potential falls short. I believe that a more charismatic personality, or at least some personality on the Lucius character would have made all the difference in allowing the audience that most basic necessity..

So, the horror loving fans will be greatly disappointed. But, for those of us who like surprises and characterizations, this movie delivered.I don't want to give too much away, but I will share this. The acting was first rate. Joaquin Phoenix (Lucius), Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy), William Hurt (Edward Walker) and an unrecognizable Adrien Brody (Noah) were excellent. If you love good acting, that would be the first reason to see this movie. If you like surprises, that would be second reason to see this movie.

Also, it has been marketed as a movie that it is not, and the director has not given his audience any of what they came to see. But, the thing is, you don't realize any of this until the end when it comes together that you've been gypped. When the movie ends, if you're left asking yourself ""What about...?"" or ""Does that mean...?"" Then, the answer is yes-- yes, nothing happened; yes, it was *that* dumb; yes, you *are* right. I'm trying to write this without spoilers. Bear with me.The movie is at times very entertaining. There are even a couple very well done scenes. Some of the acting is good, some is awful.

479,kburditt,A Gothic tale by a gifted story teller.,10,3 August 2004,"This is a great story, a well crafted film, and a positive move for a young, talented film maker. M. Night Shyamalan has proven that the power of a movie is in the story, not the special effects. It is in the directing, editing, cinematography, and acting, not the cheap thrills. If you're expecting a formulaic thriller, a bloody slasher film, or another sci-fi twist at the end - you will be disappointed. If you go wanting to be mesmerized by a complex, layered story, and terrific ensemble acting - you will be enjoying and thinking about this film for days. This film is about fear, and how fear impacts lives, and controls a communities future. This film is about the community misfits rising above the group fear to face the unknown, the unseen, and find their own courage and leadership. Something to think about in this time of Homeland Security and Code Orange Alerts. Shyamalan is being compared to Hitchcock - but Hitchcock at his prime, with years of film making under his belt. Compare Shyamalan to the young Hitchcock of ""A Lady Vanishes"", ""Sabotage"", and the first ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"". There you will see a strong story teller, testing his theories, and refining his craft. Is this the best Shyamalan film? I hope not, I hope in 10 and 20 years Shymalan will be weaving his stories, and keeping us on the edge of our seats with greater films. The man is a gifted story teller - and his medium is film. And for those who have criticized the 'stilted' dialogue - if you read diaries from the 1800's, the dialogue is not far off the mark. It was a time when people considered speaking and oration an art to practice.I enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it.",The Village

I actually paid for a ticket to see this movie and had it not been for the fact I went with friends and didn't drive, I'd have walked out. It was money wasted. 5/10..and that's being generous. I gave it a 5 only because the actual story wasn't bad, just the execution of it and portrayal of it. It was actually a good idea, but way too far fetched to be believable about 1/4 of the way through. I've seen this director's other movies; Signs, The Sixth sense, Stuart Little, and they're pretty good, but this one's a flop. You'll find yourself asking yourself throughout the movie..""would they do this""?, ""that doesn't seem right""! Too many holes..and not nearly as frightening as the trailers allow you to believe. Save yourself some money and only see it if you can borrow it. I'd say it's only worth seeing to see Joaquin Phoenix, he's intense and a great choice for the role.

Even though it's not scary, it still does keep you on the edge of your seat.The movie had just enough cutesy romance in it to push it forward, yet not enough to gross out the guys and make it a chick flick. I mean...the most that they worry about their wedding night is ""Will you dance with me on our wedding night?"" And there is one kiss in the movie. Big whoopty-doo. 8-| Although (at least I don't think) it did not say in the beginning ""Based on a true story"", this movie really gets you wondering if that whole ""cult like"" part was based on a real-life cult, who really did make up ""those which we do not speak of"".The only reason I give this movie a 7 and not an 8 or 9 is because of the last minute of the movie. I mean, what kind of movie ends with the line ""I'm back"", not actually letting you know if the guy lives or not!?! It's sheer torture I tell you!!! Now I understand some people think that this is good because then you can allow your imagination to make up the ending, but personally, I really do not like those kind of endings, especially with love stories.As with Sixth Sense, way to go M Night Shyamalan! (But there are colors other than red out there. ;) ) (Lastly, it's just my opinion, but I think it would have been cooler if Ivy jumped out of the way when Noah went for her, and that sharp part of the log she kept grabbing goudged him, instead of him falling down the hole...but then again that's just me. =P I guess that is another thing that would appeal to some people...Shyamalan manages to give the movie that creepy feeling without much blood and gore-except for whatever is on the skinned dogs or whatever those are.)",The Village

I have to admit that after the reveal that there were no monsters and it was just a cover up by the elders I thought the action had stopped but no, the final chase was incredible and the shot where the camera pans out and you see that she is standing in a field of red berries creates dread beautifully.All in all, great movie, really worth the watch.",The Village

Night Shatamalan (sp?) has a trailer that doesn't reflect exactly the movie.Where can you see in the Unbreakable trailer that this is a movie about comic books? I learned it in the first minute of the movie, but I wasn't aware before that, even seeing the trailers.Going into a movie from this directory, you HAVE to think ""there will be a twist"", but you are just plain stupid if you are trying to guess it before the end, you want to spoil your experience, don't you?I never saw it coming, but the worst part is, I didn't even notice that we were *WARNING SPOILERS* in actual time when she got on the road... it took me a minute... didn't had the same effect on me as the other twists in the other Shatamalan movies, but after thinking about the whole movie, it was a pretty good ending, you now know you have to watch it again to see all the clues you were stupid enough not to notice.I must admit that when I saw the feast scene, I said to myself ""Funny, this could be in modern time, they don't look too old fashioned"", but it never clicked in my head that this was in modern time.Plus, the more I read comments (good ones, not negative ones, I can understand why some people felt cheated due to the trailer, but nevertheless, it doesn't make the movie BAD), I now think the best one is the one that notices that the camera from the wood where people are scared, it looks exactly like if they were scared of us, watching them, through the screen...I won't say it's M. Night Shatamalan's best, but I'm trully a fan of his movies, and I can't wait for more. This is the type of movie that could get oscar nominations, the cinematography is quite amazing, the costumes and scenes makes you feel truly in 1897, and well, Adrian Body's performance is worthy of an best supporting actor nomination for sure...

I can't say if I liked it or not, but one thing for sure, I didn't dislike it... but there are still elements of that movie that I don't get, as why they have decided that the color red would be banned, and yellow would be a safe color, plus, I have problems to believe that teenagers wouldn't venture in those woods.. we're all idiots at this age...Oh well, time will tell me if I loved it or not, but sure thing is, i wasn't disappointed...",The Village

Distanced from the advertising hype and the bad press, I rented it with little or no expectations about what I was going to see.To my utter delight, what I got to watch was a splendid movie that is a wonderful study of character, mood, suspense, and neat twists that would have made Rod Serling proud. This movie is quintessential ""Twilight Zone"" material only so much more richer for the excellent performances by virtually every cast member and the script which fleshes out a delicate, multi-layered world. All of this would be very difficult to accomplish in a standard 30-minute TZ episode.This movie is a wonderful treat that is quite unusual for standard Hollywood fare.

Night's film the Village is indeed a frightening suspense film that has you guessing at every turn.  Night is a master of foreboding and chills you at every turn in his movies........this film is no exception.  It makes you think and wonder at all times.......why do these people live the way they do?  It constantly makes you think about what is happening here and why these creatures live in the woods.  The cinematography is exceptional by the many times Academy Award nominee Roger Deakins, who shot my favorite film, the masterful Shawshank Redemption!  This film is genuinely terrifying at times especially when you do see glimpses of the terrible creatures and their doings. And as you already know about Night films there is a twist ending that will spellbind you to the very core..........Night also has an amusing cameo!  **** stars.",The Village
488,frojavigdis,Another reason Shyamalan is the most breathtaking director of the decade,10,14 August 2004,"Mysteriously isolated in the forest, the villagers must live with the threat of unknown beings that inhabit the surrounding woods.  Fear of the unknown does not stand in the way of the love between two young villagers.It is difficult to praise this movie without giving away its secrets, but this is a movie that would have been true to the heart of Joseph Campbell the mythologist.  Not for the average moviegoer, this film is presented in a stylistic manner full of dialogue that impresses with its  biblical gravity and unusual but likeable main characters.  Visually, it is splendid to watch like Shyamalan's other recent films.",The Village
489,vaudevillejones,"Shyamalan confuses ""atmospheric"" and ""soulful"" with ""slow"" and ""boring"".",5,30 November 2005,"This was a film that I came to with high expectations. After the awful 'Signs', this looked to be Shyamalan back on form. Unfortunately, I found it a huge disappointment.This film is an attempt to capture... what? It mainly deals with life in an isolated village in the 19th century. But then Shyamalan throws in elements of Gothic horror with the knowledge that there is something nasty in the woods. There are two major twists, both of which are fairly predictable.In fact, one could say that this film looks like someone else trying to emulate M. Night Shyamalan. So on top of the predictable twists, there are lots of... slow... sequences... and pauses... to add atmosphere... which become... frustrating... after a while. Add in the ""I like the language in The Crucible"" style of period dialogue, and the whole thing starts to look pretentious and smug.Better than 'Signs', but still far from M. Night Shyamalan's best work.",The Village
490,Mikee_Maher,Very under-rated M. Night movie!,9,15 November 2020,"The Village is so underrated and I think that's because most people thought this film was a horror film and it's not. Sure it has some fear elements but it is rather a thriller than a horror and it was very good!
It is filled with M. Night's style, suspense and tension were build perfectly and M played around with the facts making you very engaged.",The Village
491,KirstenJackson,"Startling, Mysterious....",7,24 April 2005,"I was very impressed with ""The Village"" . I expected more of a slasher-like film, and was pleased that wasn't what it was. M. Night Shyamalan (Director of Sixth Sense and Signs) has a tendency to make movies that make you wonder, make you think, make you surprised at the unexpected outcome of his films. This movie does just that. When the final outcome of the movie is revealed (which is basically the last 10 minutes of the film) you think ""Oh my gosh, I never would have guessed!"" And you most likely would have not. All the actors in this movie played great roles and the characters were very realistic and believable. The plot of this movie is that the small, secluded village surrounded by woods is believed to be being threatened by the inhabitants of the other town. The creatures that haunt them occasionally are mysterious and has been proved violent. The people of the small village are forced to stay, seeing they know the creatures in the next town will not be pleased if they came to visit. This movie will leave you thinking, pleased with the outcome, yet a little questionable..... I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good startle every once in a while and loves a mystery. 7 out of 10 stars",The Village
492,refrankfurt,What's that smell down in Dingley-Dangley Dell?,1,21 January 2006,"It is difficult to see how any comments could possibly spoil a movie that already spoils itself with such surgical precision, but for what it's worth, be warned: part of the big surprise may be divulged in what follows.Uh-oh. Look out. Here it comes.Really. I warned you.Last chance to turn back.What's the big surprise? The whole creature thing is a charade to keep the inbred villagers from wandering out into the real world. It might have been more entertaining if the creatures had turned out to be real, and the village was a charade they cooked up to keep their children from wandering out of the forest.More than one commentator has noted that this plodding, pompous piece of crap tells basically the same story you can find in a half hour episode of Twilight Zone. Strangely enough, the original ""Teenage Cavemen"" tells a very similar tale also. For that matter, the story of Adam and Eve is not entirely unrelated. The point being, this whole idea is as stale as the biscuits from King Tut's tomb. And presumably Mr. Shyamalan is not really such an arrogant fool that he doesn't realize it.Every person who paid money to see this garbage should have his money refunded, and receive a personal apology from the producers.",The Village
493,billyzduke,Shyamalan is the Most Overrated Director Working Today,3,30 July 2004,"When I first saw the Sixth Sense, my date and I almost walked out because we were so bored.  It was clumsy, not scary, and although partially redeemed by the now famous twist ending, it boggles my mind that it remains so highly regarded, and is often included on ""best of"" lists aside films far more deserving of the superlative.With his subsequent movies, Shyamalan has done little but prove that he is indeed a one-trick pony (and it's not even his trick, but Rod Serling's). With the failed Unbreakable, he at least attempted to break new ground, but Signs and The Village both seem desperately designed as crowd-pleasing machines, offering up more of the same slow, creepy atmosphere that seemed to appeal to so many who saw his first blockbuster, with increasingly arbitrary plot twists.This is an unfortunate situation for any director.  The best thing about the Sixth Sense was that it took the audience by surprise, but since it made him so famous, he can never pull off that kind of surprise again.  When the viewers expect surprise, how can they possibly be surprised?  The fact that he has gone for some kind of ""big twist"" every time out is, by the fourth time, simply wearying, and ultimately distracting from the gifts he does possess as a director.Here, his cast suffers as well from his single-mindedness.  Where his other films focused primarily on a brooding male protagonist (Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson, respectively), The Village plays as more of an ensemble piece, at least in the beginning, and when the focus does narrow, it does so on a young blind girl.  There are a truckload of excellent actors on board, including Ron Howard's talented daughter as the blind Ivy Walker, but the considerable time spent on characterization goes up in smoke the closer we get to the end, which, in Shyamalan's eyes, all things must serve.I will remember The Village as the only film to which I guessed the ending after seeing only the trailer.  And it was my first guess.  If he's going to keep making movies, Shyamalan literally needs to give up the ghost.  And his self-injected cameos are almost as annoying as Tarantino's.  Mark my words: This will tank quickly after opening weekend.",The Village
494,Pursewarden,Forget the twist,8,17 September 2004,"The big problem of M. Night Shyamalan movies is that he created this twist ending trademark. If by all means any movie that spots ""surprise ending"" will end up spoiling it since everyone in the audience is going to be expecting something, the game enters an endless and stupid fight of egos. The director trying to show how smart he is pulling up surprises, and the audience anticipating anyhow. Thus most movie reviews of THE VILLAGE speak about the not so surprising ending, the disappointing surprise, etc. Well if the movie was JUST the surprise, it would, certainly, be a waste with a better place as a Twilight Show chapter. But THE VILLAGE is much more than a twist ending. If you enter the theater understanding you are probably not going to be surprised and let the burden of surprise out of the movie, then you have a very good suspenseful, and enjoyable, drama with a few minor scares. One played wonderfully by the cast (except maybe Brody, going over the top), and with a very subtly direction by Shyamalan. If there is a future for this director, he should forget the success of the SIXTH SENSE and try to focus into storytelling, something he does better than four fifths of today's directors.",The Village

The ending was a surprise for sure, but not unreasonable. If you follow all the evidence of what was all said (and for those who miss the points made, they repeat again and again throughout the movie what they are), it all makes sense. The village and what is going on there is something I share a sense of longing for, as I am sure do many people. I have often thought, would it not be great to live in a world like that, free of the burdens of all this Western society crap? If we could, would we not want to preserve it? I feel the pain of the characters that drove them to seek out this solace and understand their desire to have that, what we all truly long for in our isolating and often painful world, the innocence we lost, and a world of simplicity. Kudos to the director, you see in true colours, I only wish everyone else would try to as well.",The Village
496,Viz79,A movie that should leave you thinking.. if you are capable of it,10,4 September 2004,"The problem with many of Night's films are that they require that little bit extra from the viewers - it did not start with Sixth Sense's landmark twist, but with Unbreakable's interesting theories which did not seem fantastical considering. But people these days don't want to 'give' in the cinema to get an additional experience.. it should all be easy viewing and all 'take'Now in The Village, we are left with a film with constant building tension, numerous twists altering the truth of the movie, wonderful acting but most important of all, asking *you* whether the life you lead is really the 'essence' of how it should be, or whether it was the villagers there that had it just right. People consider the movie a fantasy - but then all of Night's movies have been just that.. movies are about escapism after all.I wonder if this movie will only be appreciated in years to come on looking back rather than the current 'jump galore' slashfest horror generation that can't seem to grasp the simple beauty of The Village.I loved it and I think it is Night's best film, surpassing the Sixth Sense in its whole - go in with a thoughtful mind and enjoy a wonderful ride.",The Village
497,Trelloskilos,Hilarious!! (Hang on. What do you mean it wasn't a comedy?),1,8 August 2006,"I'm sorry, I just don't get the popularity of M Night Shyalaman. The Sixth Sense was a great film, but everything I've seen after that (and with the exception of Lady in the Water, that's everything since)has been either a load of horse puck. I thought that the guy was a one-trick pony, and I think this movie pretty much confirms it.And so to the Village...Well, it started off promisingly enough, with the mysterious sounds from the woods and concerned looks during a Village outdoor dinner, but the film was terrible. Not just the pseudo-olde-English (how did the actors keep a straight face when they were reciting their lines?) to the inexplicable ability of a blind girl to run 100 metres without colliding into a single object whilst in other scenes, she was fumbling about for a step on her own front porch. There were many surprise goofs, gaffes and scenes consisting of pure untainted cheese that was enough to set off the giggles, and once the first unintentionally funny moment crops up, the film just throws up more and more.I guess what made the film so funny was the sincerity and dignity in which it was acted and delivered. Add to that prolonged moments of tedium and then BAM, someone says or does something so unutterably trite, clichéd, or inexplicably stupid that you just have to burst out laughing. It's like someone from the RSC reciting a soliloquy from Othello and accidentally letting one rip.All said and done, though, I sussed the ""Big denouement"" of the film about 1/3rd of the way in, and that's saying something, cos normally, I'm a bit thick when it comes to twists. Maybe it's because it is expected of a Shyalaman film, or maybe, like ""Signs"", it's all been done before but presented in a way that gets movie snobs thinking that it's the first time that particular tale has been told.It's a good trick, but nothing more. Shyalaman really needs to remember that a good plot is more than just a twist. If the build-up sucks, then the denouement is really going to lack a punch.",The Village

500,ANDREWEHUNT,One of the most Contrived Films I've ever seen.,1,8 December 2004,"Other than one or two half-hearted performances, nothing about this film worked. It was utterly predictable (who didn't see that end coming a good hour or more before it arrived???), lacking the surprise twist of even one of the lesser ""Twilight Zone"" episodes. The dialogue was as hokey as I've ever seen in a film in the past five years. The ""scary"" scenes lacked any genuine suspense or sense of dread. Did you get a load of those monsters? Goodness, they made the Tree Monster in ""From Hell It Came"" look downright frightening by comparison. Adrien Brody, one of the greatest living actors, was utterly wasted as an unbelievable mentally challenged character. Poor Bryce Dallas Howard--who I'm sure is an outstanding actress if given a decent role--was as flat here as a bottle of Sprite that has been open for five days. Good old William Hurt was so over the top he was almost unbearable! All in all, this dull turkey has little going for it. Too bad, because ""Sixth Sense"" was such a gripping and emotional film.",The Village
501,cwoliver-1,Nice concept - poor execution.,1,6 October 2005,"The village was an so-so movie based on an interesting idea. All the actors were believable in their parts (save one), the scenery and cinematography was good, the set was rather neat, and the suspense and mystery was satisfying though not gut wrenching. So what's wrong with it? Well first off is the thought that you could have a sufficient size plot of land to support some 100 people in the middle of Pennsylvania and, 1)keep it secret from outsiders, 2)keep it secret from insiders. While PA is not wall to wall city, it certainly is settled enough to make this impossible. And the ""no planes flying over"" agreement was priceless - in a heavy air corridor on the east coast? Next, fine group of progressive liberal thinking social workers this bunch is. When they're attacked just like the people they're supposed to help, and the going gets tough, what do they do? Work with the police to increase patrols? Form neighborhood watches? Set up security cameras, buy sling shots? Nope, they cut out. Truly dedicated social workers.Back to the village. As the story begins to get interesting, one of the characters is injured. So who do we send for medicine? I know, let's send THE BLIND GIRL, she'll do anything. What!!! If you believed that there are evil beings in the woods, or at least say you do, why, why, WHY would you send the BLIND girl? Even woods not filled with evil creatures would be treacherous enough that you'd never consider sending someone who is blind.OK, so off she goes. Now Bryce Dallas Howard who plays Ivy Walker, the blind girl, did a fine job - except that from time to time she forget she was blind. Merely having someone look at the ground and moan ""foo, I wish I could see"", is not enough.In the woods she encounters one of the evil creatures - and deftly dispatches him like a Navy SEAL. What? Was he blind too? No. Then how could a young blind girl trick a sighted creature into falling into a hole? Either she took lessons from the blind Kung Foo master or she used ""the force.""She reaches the outside wall and somehow immediately knows to climb over it - going around it never crosses her mind. She doesn't even explore the breadth of it to see if it's possible to go around. Maybe there's a lower section, stairs, a doorway, a gate, a fallen tree. No, SEALs only travel by straight line so over she goes.Once over the wall she encounters a security guard. She's not the least bit curious about this wonderful hard, flat, and wide path she's on or even if she's made it to the next village. He isn't very curious about where a blind girl might have come from and she doesn't seem to know. But he agrees to help her get the medicine and off he goes - leaving the blind intruder standing in the middle of the road. Some security guard.He arrives at the guard shack and is conveniently (for the gaps in the storyline) admonished about what happens to those that talk to intruders too much and, in case he was wondering, told why planes don't fly over. He then walks to the medical supply cabinet (which is there for all the intruders that get attacked by animals but never get over the wall and make it to the village?) The cabinet has the exact medicine(s)and hypodermic needles needed (lucky us). The supply of medicine in this cabinet would put a Long's Drug Store to shame. How many intruders do they have anyway? Thank goodness they're not kept under lock and key, and there's no need to sign them out. Presumably he returns to Ivy with the medicine(she's still standing in the road, I guess) and gives it to her - then he drives off no questions asked leaving the mysterious blind intruder still standing in the middle of the road. Or maybe he helps her over the wall. Brilliant.I'll stop here. You're tired, I'm tired, and my ability to dismiss reality is stretched well beyond its limits. There is more but I think you see why I'm less than thrilled with this movie.",The Village

But it isn't... let me count the ways; stale, boring, lifeless characters under the genre Horror to NOT have any horror and a cheesy down right stupid twist ending make this movie not only pointless but terrible. You could argue that no one saw that coming, sure and you'd be right. The reason why people couldn't see that ending coming? Cause its out of place and stupid. I know he is a good director and a good writer but this has to be him laziest work ever. (I take that back because he has out done himself with Happening and Last Airbender) It doesn't help that there are no scary moments and the actors are dreadfully boring.Not a single scary thing happened during this entire movie. It's now labelled suspense but the trailers during its release made it look like a horror movie. Which is why I saw it. I like horror movies and this wasn't horror. Two cheap jumpscares that wouldn't scare my mom, extremely dumb monsters that you only see a few times and they never built the horror up to be suspenseful or have any tension/atmosphere. This movie failed in every aspect.!!::WARNING SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH::!! Okay... so they are going to create their own perfect village away from crime and blah blah blah. If the story is set in the present time why the hell did they go and make their village ye-olde times? Wouldn't a nuclear war that killed every part of the world except for their village be better? Or a virus swept across the world and they were immune? You could wear normal clothes and have normal tools just don't bring any cell phones or computers to the village. Anyone who isn't an elder doesn't know a damn thing, kids only know the world they live in by what they are told from parents.... if the kid doesn't find out on their own. You don't even mention phones to them and they will never know that technology existed. Or hell pretend your Omish at least, that way you can have the helpful tools for crops and farming but no technology for them to ever find out what happened. Going outside the village? Anything would of been better than dumb people in costumes! Tell them there isn't anything out there but barren wastelands and dangerous mutated animals. Poison gas, radiation or the scariest thing of all... people. Tell them there are groups of dangerous murdering psychos who all have their own villages or something. Anything would have been better than ""we live in ye-olde times"" cause there a tons of things that could ruin their cover up.I'm not writer I'm just a movie go-er but I was not at all shocked or scared by this movie.

Having finally seen 2004's ""The Village"" I can now endow confirmation. THIS is the abomination that killed M. Night Shyamalan's career.Never in the history of recorded time has any movie been more massively marketed to the masses. And never has any film been more of a miserable disappointment. A thriller devoid of even a mild buzz. A mystery with a dreadfully dumb and barely comprehensible solution. The waste of a cast so impressive the hope is that they were all paid handsomely for their parts in such an appallingly hopeless cause.The only possible point to be extracted from this wretched wreck could conceivably be, in the words of that classic comic strip philosopher Pogo, ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" But even THAT is stretching it.Even the ending blows. Chunks. MNS would have been better served (but not by much) to have stuck with the original ending. Google it.

504,jt4,A lot of people not likely to get it.,10,31 July 2004,"I saw the movie opening night, and again the next day.  Along with a lot of negative reviews I've heard, I also at the theater heard teenagers in particular saying they didn't like the movie.  Right off the bat, I expect very few teenagers to like this movie.  I also expect those adults with, shall we say, a lack of depth of experience, to not get this movie either. Just as ""Signs"" was not an alien invasion movie but rather a movie about faith wrapped in the summer crowd-pleasing guise of an alien-invasion movie, ""The Village"" is about so much more than what it appears--even more so than was ""Signs"".  ""The Village"" is neither a psychological thriller as was ""The Sixth Sense"", nor does it have the aliens angle of ""Signs"",  so it isn't going to appeal to people from either of those crowds.  I'm sure I wouldn't have gotten it as a teenager, and I likely wouldn't have appreciated it much without children.  Let's face it: it's a movie for adults, and I mean adults with real concerns about living in the world that exists today.  Anyone with an extraordinary concern for their children will get it.  Unfortunately for the box office, that segment might not be as large as M. Night Shyamalan would like.  But for my money, I agree with Shyamalan in feeling that this is his best work yet.

But not in this one.At until about half way through I was about to give up, since it felt like watching a Signs re-run (effects wise) but I'm happy I decided to keep watching because it turned out to be quite the opposite.The plot was good and the acting was good as well.

So what is the big fuss? There isn't a huge plot twist, like what we have come to expect from director M. Night Shyamalan. So what? There was plenty of supsense, and more than a few good jumps.So stop listening to the critics and keep an open mind. Chances are you'll enjoy this as much as I did.",The Village
507,dsmgdesign,Another classic makes history!,9,22 January 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan is a true genius. He defies today's bloody, slasher or bang-em-up flics for classic offerings only dared by such movie makers as Rod Sterling and Alfred Hitchcock. Some may say he lives in the shadows of ""The Six Sense"". I happen to think he is only getting started in developing a true craft that no one else in Hollywood today can master. What is also forgotten in many reviews that you may read here is the signature ""everything-is-not-as it-seems"" factor that is masterfully created in The Village. Within this controlled environment lies a secret pact held by elders to protect their young from the sins of the world. A promise to create a community where innocence can prosper. Keeping them there are mysterious creatures...boogie-men of sorts....who liive in the woods that surround them. This story is about protecting love ones from harm (whether it be a parent to a child, or a young man and young woman), from protecting the weak from evil. Yet it is the ""weak"" who surprise us. And innocence lives on. A well-thought and well-executed tale that can only be told by this master of suspense. Just as in ""The Six Sense"" and ""Signs"", there are frights and chills. Just as in ""The Six Sense"" and ""Signs"", there is a twist in the plot. Just as in ""The Six Sense"" and ""Signs"", I loved the characters and loved the ride for which I was taken. The twist may not be as powerful as The Six Sense, the chills may not be as fresh, but the story is just as meaningful and awe-inspiring. And the ""everything is not as it seems"" factor is just as developed. That is what makes M. Night Shyamalan is a true genius.Brilliant! Can't wait for the next M. Night Shyamalan film.",The Village

The acting was well-done all around, especially that of Bryce Dallas Howard. Ron  has a lot to be proud of.  She was fantastic.

I felt insulted and cheated and let down. It was a cheap and dirty trick in the name of retaining audience attention and awe. Instead of thrilling us, all he managed to do was scam a good paying audience.Other than the end, the film is actually decent, the premise is scary and disturbing, and the acting is very good.

The story was anything you would hope to find in a thriller. From start to finish you are kept at your toes thinking about these creatures. What are they and what can they do. Talking about a truce makes it more intriguing because it gives these ""creatures"" a shape of thought and reasoning. I myself was wondering if these creatures were deformed men or were some sort of ""Morlocks"" like in The Time Machine.Then the story turns when Edward Walker (William Hurt) confesses to his daughter that there are no creatures and that it was all the work of the elders. Again there is a hole left in the story were he tells her that he's based his creature story on rumors about these woods. These rumors were proved by the appearance of the creature in the woods that attacked Ivy. Then after that we were introduced to the truth after a thrilling confusion of whether there are creatures or not!!Slow paced story that keeps you on your guard through out. That's the beauty of a thriller movie. Job will done Shyamalan.The cast was brilliant. Bryce Dallas Howard was very good so was Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody. William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver portrayed there characters perfectly.The direction was as good as the story. I think we are looking at the new Hitchcock.10/10",The Village

So what's the plan: Let's pretend we live in the 19th century by scaring the holy shit out of our children by telling them there are monsters in the woods, keeping them barefoot and ignorant about the world and depriving them of basic necessities like medicine so they die before we have an overpopulation problem on our hands.Of course, somehow the elders who isolate everyone have somehow allowed it to leak out that there is a town on the other side of the woods where there is medicine. Why their hostages ever need to know that, I don't know. As the years pass, none of dimwitted kids ever figure out that the ""monsters"" are really pig bones in red jump suits. In the end, it is disclosed that the only person in the whole village who is not in on the scam, but figures it out is the homicidal raving lunatic who impulsively stabs the fiancé of the girl he seems to want for himself. We are supposed to believe that this guy who stabs the fiancé something like 4314214432 times (but doesn't quit kill him), then wanders around soaked in blood until he gets ""confined"" to a room with a window (from which he of course later escapes to make more trouble) is capable of keeping the monsters secret and pretending to be one without giving himself away in the process. THIS IS JUST STUPID!! The bad news is that this isn't the most stupid part. It's just the part I'm still laughing at so I thought I would mention it.This movie is definitely to be avoided. It is not scary. It is not intellectual. It is contrived, boring drek. I gave it 2 out of 10, but only because I accidentally missed the 1 when I poked at it.",The Village
513,harveyrock12,"One of the best films i have scene, Emotional , Scary, Romantic. Beautiful.",10,31 January 2012,"Another amazing masterpiece by M. Night, After watching this movie , I was left speechless. I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The cinematography was beautiful, I had a hunch about the ending of this movie and I was right, so if you have seen scary movie 4 then you might guess a couple of things through out. However their were still twists and plots that completely shocked me.I have to say I didn't know I was in to actually be scared, I saw signs and thought that M. night would do another Gothic style thriller, I was wrong. For a 12 rated film this was really eerie and intense and did actually scare me a couple of times. This is also amazingly acted and I give so much credit to all the actors involved. The set was beautiful, and the plot was phenomenal. One of the best movies to date. I don't know maybe its not for everyone , as I have seen some negative review but my personal opinion and I am sure others agree that this is a beautiful film and will stay with you through out the rest of your life.A MASTERPIECE 10/10",The Village
514,abahb1,Movie suffers from inaccurate marketing......,7,24 October 2005,"As with M.Night's other movies, I enjoyed this latest outing, especially the performances of the leads. I think the movie suffered in overall response due to a poorly conceived marketing plan.The movie was sold as a horror film and fans of that genre went into this with that mindset in place. When the film actually turned out to be a look at how we try and protect those we love from the horrors of the ""real world"", fans were upset and rightly so. As anyone that has enjoyed M.Night's movies, all is not what it would seem. I think the marketing pushed too hard the horror aspect which created an expectation that was not going to be met.I think if you go into this movie expecting another commentary on spiritual and moral themes, you are going to like this. If you are going into this for the scare factor, you are going to be left empty.",The Village
515,AdamWhite1421,Forget who the director is and you may enjoy it,7,6 September 2004,"One must not expect too much from M Night Shyamalan. He made the fatal mistake of producing his best film first, meaning it could only go downhill from there. Unbreakable and Signs (IMHO) were not as bad as everyone made out, they just weren't as good as The Sixth Sense and the same goes for The Village. If this had been the first film by M Night Shyamalan I feel that public opinion would have been higher.The twist at the end was expected and therefore guessed pretty quickly, but if you look beyond it and see the movie as a whole it is something very beautiful. Shyamalan has used colours so well, they are integral to the story but also he allows them to beautify the screen. The dullness of peoples clothes and the buildings is contrasted by the bright yellows of the cloaks and torches and the reds of the flowers and beasts.The true winners of this movie however are Joaquin Phoenix (his best performance yet) and a surprisingly good debut by Bryce Dallas Howard. The love story between them and the way M Night Shyamalan allows it to blossom is mesmerising. The Village is an okay horror/mystery film but is a really amazing love story. I still look forward to his next project.7/10",The Village
516,ffinch247,Worth watching,8,1 February 2005,"As far as I can tell this film is actually fairly original. (Gains a few stars for that alone) The plot and storyline of this film are very profesionaly thought out and executed. I feel that the characters are well rounded and the script is descent.Don't go and see this film if you like a scream-a-minute roller-coaster horror film because thats not what it is. It's an intelligent film which dose require the use of at least two brain cells. The twist at the end will definitely be unexpected but at the same time quite simple.M Night Shyamalan is a name to look out for.All in all this is a good film, worth renting",The Village

It is a most beautiful, exquisitely thoughtful and a visual-breath taker. I cannot fathom how anyone could give this artwork negative reviews. There is nothing wrong with this movie. It is solidly paced, thoughtful lines, and oh, the camera work just blew my mind.I loved the romance. This was perhaps the best romance I have seen on screen in years. The chemistry between the lovers was so soft, and sexy without the aggression of modern love. MNS makes you feel such empathy for the characters.The plot is very intriguing, and the final scenes were just jaw-dropping. Every scene is so pretty.

518,BobStein-VisiBone,"Exquisitely Crafted Moments, of Love, of Terror -- Less is More",10,12 October 2007,"Less is more. I had to watch twice, over a long passage of time, to realize the REAL reason I loved this movie so much.The plot had some very fulfilling and original contours to it, yes, that's what I thought made it great at first. But the real core of the movie is a series of gentle interactions. Each one is about drawing meaning from what does *not* happen. Less is more. Ivy to Lucius: ""Sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them."" She's not telling him she loves him, only how she knows he loves her, which amounts to the same thing. But you don't really know she's right until you hear Lucius tell the same principle to his mom, to explain how he knows his mom is loved by Edward. Later her test of the principle, and her sliver of a smile, gives her secret away too.Less-is-more is also part of the primary plot. The fear that grips the village, particularly the children, is amplified by the scarcity and subtlety of interaction with ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"". Ha, even that name attempts to say more with less. But the REAL moral of this story, and the whole purpose of the village, is to provide a space for moments like Ivy-Lucius-Alice-Edward to happen. For less-is-more to distill the human spirit to purest essence. Every great movie is made great by a few moments. Seconds out of hours, opening up human vastness. To say Shyamalan crafts them masterfully is saying too much. I wish I could say less.",The Village
519,objesguy,The Village is Truly A Gem In the Rough,10,19 May 2005,"In theaters everywhere, The Village, directed by M. Night Shyamalan was billed as a horror film. It was to be a tale of suspense and fright that was to be as intense and as riveting as his previous and rather popular semi-horror films The Sixth Sense and Signs. Yet, the movie is nothing like a work of horror, or his former films (except for the twist ending). In fact, it hardly has any elements of horror at all, which is unusual for a Shyamalan film. However, while Shyamalan deprives the audience of a horror flick, he also pulls a surprise from his seemingly never-ending bag of tricks and presents us with a story that deals with complex and engrossing issues as love, trust and courage all in a puritan-looking village. In addition though, the film is about no ordinary ""village"" for the inhabitants are fearful superstitious colonials, who fear one thing in their lives: the creatures that inhabit the ""forbidden woods"". While this seems to set up the right formula for a typical horror film, Shyamalan refuses to follow the rules, and instead presents us with a movie that is far from the typical popcorn suspense flick that audience have gotten too accustomed to.In addition to the complex story of the ""isolated village"", the acting is a key component of the film that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end. While underrated actor Joaquin Phoenix gives another solid performance, the real star of the film is Bryce Dallas Howard, who gives a riveting and sensational inaugural performance as Phoenix's blind love interest, Ivy. Amazingly, the chemistry between the two is amazing, yet Ivy seems to be the one that stands out the most. The emotion that she is able to display through her face and body language is a true characteristic of her professionalism and also a good sign that she is a competent actor that is capable of more roles in the future.The Village is not a horror film by any standards, and that is mainly why critics everywhere have panned the film and given negative reviews. However, while it may not be a horror film, it is an unbelievable film nonetheless. In its basic essence, it is a movie that is more complex than his previous film Signs, and strikes to the heart much deeper than any of his previous three films ever did. Granted, it takes an open mind and a patient soul to get everything Shyamalan has to offer from this movie, which is something audiences aren't used to doing. However, in this day of popcorn horror and suspense films and boring linear dramas, this is a movie that definitely stands out from the crowd and is worth the price of admission in more ways than one.",The Village

521,speedyspeaker,Particularly passionate,10,5 March 2006,"This movie was made by M. Night Shyamalan, and is a most ""particularly"" good movie. Its about a village based in about pioneer ages, and their pretty happy out in their forest surrounded neighborhood. But there's only one problem, there there's mythical beasts out in the woods, their very intelligent but do not come into the village if you don't come into there forest. The people have always lived like this and always will. Sometimes, strong people have to guard the entrance of the woods just in case, they also wear yellow because it drives the monsters awaybut, to your horror, the monsters are attracted by the color red. No one must ever wear red, if you find a red berry or flower or just something red, bury it. Of course, people normally get ill, and rare brave people ask the ""elders"" if they can go to the other ""villages"" across the forest to get medicine to stop sicknesses & even death sense it's a poor village because it might happen a lot. The Stars are Lucius Hunt (played by Joaquin Phoenix) & the main Star heroine, Ivy Walker (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, she's new). Lucius hardly talks to anyone and Ivy is blind. I better stop here so that I wont go telling the end of the story and spoil it all J. but, I really absolutely positively recommend seeing this movie because its one of the best movies ever, best music (I can say that again! No kidding!), best acting (wow!! Yeah!), well, best everything! Its really THAT good, Mr. Shyamalan is really & truly a wonderful film maker for beauty & scariness!! Thank you, M. Night Shyamalan!!!",The Village
522,EdMatt13,Alright,6,9 June 2021,"M Night Shyamalan films cause one of three reactions with me. 'Wow', 'Alright' and 'That's enough Netflix for today.'
The village follows a small town (it's more of a village I just didn't want to use the same word twice) that is plagued by attacks from mysterious cloaked figure. Sadly, this film falls into the second option.The first 50 or so minutes of this movie are amazing and that is not an overstatement- I genuinely could see this film rivalling the sixth sense if it was able to keep up such a high quality for the remaining 58 minutes. The characters in this film are its strongest point and they are excellently set up to be likeable and compelling protagonists, Joaquin Phoenix's Lucius Hunt is a silent but compelling character and Bryce Dallas Howard's Ivy is a compassionate and wise protagonist. They are supported by some great performances from the likes of Adrien Brody and Brendan Gleeson and the growing mystery of the strange nighttime attacks raises the tension to a breaking point after a suspicious attack. (I won't say any more for spoiler reasons.)
Sadly, this film begins to derail slightly after this point, it feels as though it reaches a high then crashes as the final forty or so minutes feel flabby and boring, despite the amazing performances. I feel as though the film wastes its most compelling and exciting moments in the first half and drags in the second with a twist that could be so much more interesting if it were padded with the same tension from the first two acts.The Village is an alright movie with an amazing cast and some spectacular performances but an ending that does not do its beginning justice. The soundtrack backs up the film incredibly well throughout however, the lone violins provide a suspenseful atmosphere to the film. This is far from Shyamalan's worst film, but also far from his best. I would recommend to horror fans who don't want to watch anything too scary or gory or even just if you're looking for a film to watch of an evening. Just don't let your hopes get too high.Thanks for reading :)",The Village
523,Mykewood,Avoid this movie.. Please!,1,2 August 2004,"*** Spoilers, if there can be such a thing with this piece of crap ***This is the worst movie I have seen in recent memory. Jeepers Creepers manned that post in my list until last night. This movie is long, boring, predictable. There is a conversation between Ivy & one of the Elders about 15 mins into the movie, which gives away the so-called ""twist"" at the end. A few mins later... Lucius sees one of the ""monsters"". It's looks so bad & is so obviously a person in a suit that the entire movie has been given away in the 1st 25 mins... but you sit there for the next 90 hoping something else happens... Well... it doesn't... You've just been had... this is movie is worse than Taking Lives (a similar movie in that it gives away the ending 20 mins in) but at least there are some interesting things happening later on. The Village has nothing. No interesting side plots. No interesting characters other than Ivy... She does a good job, but her character doesn't have enough depth to carry a movie. She is the ONLY part of this movie worth seeing. How can you have a 2-hour so called thriller, but give away the only 2 ""thrilling"" points of the movie 25 mins in. M.Night had a gem in Sixth Sense. People keep wondering why he brought that out 1st, & then the rest of this crap, i.e. Signs, Unbreakable, & the Village, afterwards... the reason is simple. If we had all seen any of those movies 1st, we would never have paid to see any more... much less paying to see Sixth Sense. So instead, he brings out the best 1st. Forcing us all to go see is later films in the hope one of them will be as good as the 1st. Well... they aren't... Not even Close. We have been had by a con artist on a mass scale... He suckered us in with that 1st great one... & has been cashing in with crap ever since...

525,Grosik_Stim,So Many Good Ideas... So Little Execution,5,23 December 2004,"Yes, this film was marketed poorly. Yes, the trailers were misguided. But yes, this is also not a very good film.The problem is that Night has introduced too many concepts, ideas and sub-plots with not enough time to fully realize any of them. The casting is wonderful; Hurt does his best ""intellectual every man"", Phoenix is a decently stoic enigma and newcomer Bryce is actually fantastic as the lead. But Sigourney Weaver is given little to do and some difficult, mundane dialogue to act her way through. Brendan Gleeson is inexcusably underused and Adrien Brody seems to have been edited out of any real emotional impact.What this film wants to be is a comment on contemporary America - where a group of intellectuals (with the funding of one very wealthy family), disenfranchised with modern street violence and urban decay, could conceivably remove themselves from the modern world and live in the perceived utopia of a rural 19th century. But too many easy answers, tacked on script ""quick fixes"", and multiple convenient solutions expose the many holes in the film making. It always feels like Night was tacking on justification scenes as the film posed questions instead of having a clear vision at the script stage. I won't go into all of the examples - but there are many (costumes hidden under floorboards, a blind girl, a mentally challenged man who can't expose the truth of the woods, a clearly quick-fix line about someone paying off the government to not fly over the commune, etc). You never get the sense that Brody is in love enough to kill. You never really fear the ""woods"", you are never really forced to wonder what is in the boxes in the elders' homes, and the creatures should never have been shown (first rule of mis-direction-based suspense!). I'll offer this one question as an example indicative of the other problematic elements: Why - if the ""elders"" know that it is really not the 1800's, and also know that they are living in a protected area set up by the Walker family - do they make such a fuss about Ivy going for medicine? They know what she will find but not be able to see. Unlike Night's previous films, the mystery is not guarded in a realistic way. He makes these elders seem suspicious and mysterious solely for the benefit of the audience, but there is no real justification for the characters themselves. This is troubling throughout the film and ends up like most badly written suspense films where the twists only trick the viewer but seem ridiculous and improbable if you just deal with the fictional world contained in the film.All in all, it's overly-simplistic; the equivalent of the ""it was all a dream"" device. While I was not disappointed that this film was not the horror thrill ride that the trailers would have you believe, I was disappointed that a clever idea was so badly edited together (it looks like hours of footage was shot, but slashed down to its essential plot points for time) and never realized. It's a shame, it could have been a great film if Night would have stuck to a couple fully developed characters and plot paths and really got us to invest in them.",The Village

527,Michael-RGV,Simply Amazing!,8,1 August 2004,"I have to say that ""The Village"" was not what I expected. It was even better! I rated this an 8 because of the slow start, but once it got my attention I was captivated!This has all the makings of a great mystery movie. It starts out in a village set at the turn of the century. The town is isolated by from all the nearby towns by woods that have seemingly intelligent, but vicious creatures in them. The elders that run the town say there is a truce, but none-the-less the creatures make their presence known. (Wouldn't be much of a mystery if nothing happened, now would it?)One of the citizens tries to leave the town to bring needed supplies such as medicine, but is rebuffed by the elders. The people of ""The Village"" follow their leaders there without question. Most are happy to stay where they are out of fear of the creatures that live in the woods.This is one of those movies that keep you thinking about it even after you leave because it intentionally doesn't tie up every loose end. Though I usually like resolution in the movies I see, sometimes it has a good fit to certain movies, such as this one. The surprises toward the end will keep you thinking about this for days!Watch and enjoy!",The Village

529,martine-12,Quite possible the worst Shyamalan film yet,1,22 August 2004,"When I saw The Sixth Sense I was awestruck by the very clever twist ending. Unfortunately when it comes to scripts following The Sixth Sense, M Night Shyamalan keeps beating the same old horse, although with a new coat of paint.After seeing Unbreakable and Signs quite recently I had very low expectations when seeing The Village. Despite this the movie didn't live up to them.The story was very weak and the tempo was more or less non-existent with boring and flat characters. Quite often I found myself wishing that the actors would just stop talking so that the movie could move on.Despite William Hurt and Joaquin Phoenix doing a good job they couldn't lift Shyamalans at times quite pretentious and wooden script to any heights worth mentioning. If anyone but Shyamalan had delivered this script to a studio it would have been refused at once.The twist end, which of course is present, was anything but exciting and neither me nor my friend found it very ""twisting"" to begin with as you can see it coming. And unlike The Sixth Sense there is a lot of holes in this movie that you notice right away.No, Shyamalan needs to get back on track, this movie did nothing to improve his rating in my book. Quite the contrary.",The Village
530,captain-balrog,Its not big and its not clever,1,30 April 2009,"This chap has made a career out of what in modern times is considered a poor plot device that is indicative of a lack of writing skill, the deus ex machina or god from the machine. For those who aren't familiar with this it comes from Greek tragedy where a god character would be lowered onto the stage via a crane and would then solve a given plot line. Deus ex machina's meaning has expanded to include out of the blue resolutions to plot lines in modern fiction; this is what I tend to think of as a 'Dan dan Dahhhhhh' moment. It is a cheep trick and once you know that a particular writer/director is prone to it their work becomes very predictable. In addition to using the same trick as many of shyamalan's other movies the village is also an excruciatingly dull, plodding affair filled with bland characters and incredibly silly plot holes but I think others have said all that needs to be said about that. What i really want to know is why everyone in the village talks like Yoda.I don't comment here often but it really annoys me when this kind of thing gets a reputation for being clever. The Fountain is a clever movie that works on many different levels and is also extraordinarily beautiful in both story and look. Those of you who think the village has something to offer as a love story might want to take a look at The Fountain as an example of a movie that has real emotional depth.In closing I would like to say that I think the deus ex machina can be a fun device in a popcorn movie like the statue of liberty appearing at the end of planet of the apes but it is not clever by any stretch. It's the kind of thing a bunch of stoned teenagers might come up with sitting around in a bedroom having one of those wouldn't it be cool if conversations.P.S. The comparisons with Spielberg are not unfair in my view, a plot that takes place as a backdrop to a seen it all before family drama? Awfully familiar.",The Village
531,bill-17550,Solid effort that prompted a lot of odd extremist reactions,7,16 January 2019,"I'm amazed how polarizing this film apparently was (I guess I'm one of the last to see it for the first time). I guess I'm one of the few who didn't think it was so amazing, but didn't hate it either. It is not without flaws. More time should have been spent on character development/interaction and yeah, I couldn't really buy the disappointing and implausible ending which people claim they ""knew"" ahead of time (suurre you did), but it wasn't so terrible. And I was in fact glad as it unfolded that it wasn't a silly ""thriller/horror"" flick as I feared it might be and the final ending it didn't stop the film from being well worth the watch overall. The acting (esp Howard and Brody) is excellent, and they did an excellent job of having people sound and act like people in an isolated village of the (earlier, I think, not late) 19th century probably would have...which is extremely rare. If I had a nickel for every period piece where the people talked and acted more or less like people of today, eliciting an eye roll and ""let's see what else is on"" from me, I'd be rich.

Unfortunately, i'm still stuck for good comments about this film! I've watched 'The Village' three times to give it a chance, but this effort by Shyamalan is such a disappointment compared to its predecessors! I love 'Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs', and am really looking forward to seeing 'The Lady In The Water'! The first three are fantastic films that I can watch over and over again, always feeling the same emotions as the first time I saw them! Yet 'The Village' was so unbelievably boring that i couldn't believe that it had been written and directed by the same man! Honestly, the only thing i can say about this film is that after about 1hr 45mins into the film i suddenly realised that pretty much nothing had happened and therefore the only reason i continued to watch was the sheer belief that surely something good had to happen soon! I even told my friends that they had to see it just to see exactly what i was telling them! Towards the end it picked up very slightly where the blind girl was running through the forest and it had his usual clever twist which did work, however when it finally finished i was in such a state of confusion and disappointment that i couldn't stop laughing!

I predict that box office will fall off drastically next weekend, once word gets around to friends of this weekend's audience. Almost as bad as 'Unbreakable.' 'Signs' was only slightly better.

The plot is so thin and insulting, it's like being thirty-five years old and having someone attempting to explain the story of the Three Bears to you in detail like you are unable to grasp a single thought. Joaquin Phoenix looks pained to be in every scene, like he is wishing to collect his check and get out of this crappy film. He does a great deal of the film without speaking a word, probably to get out of having to speak the ridiculous dialogue in this movie. When they talked about the ""magic rocks"" I almost lost it.

The story was built on character development and good development of plot. The Village however lacked everything. Let me start out by saying that this movie is a knock off of another story written about 3 years ago and you know what that story was dumb then and its dumb now. I hated this film from the beginning. When I think of a guy whose name utters ""one trick pony"" M. Night Shyamalan, I mean come on people the guy needs to stop making this boring ""thrillers"" and try to branch out not every movie can have an ""exciting twist"" to it. So the film follows a bunch of people living in an isolated village, (that doesn't seem to be from any time period) hmm... I wonder what could be going on just from that comment any one with half a brain can guess this plot I watched the film for 5 minutes and I new how this one was going to end. The work seemed to lack the flare that Shyamalan had in the Sixth Sense it also seemed to be on of his most boring films yet. He doesn't even really give the audience a chance to get to know or like the characters. Right off the bat we see that a child has died because the ""Village lacks medication"" that can save the boys life and we are supposed to pity these poor folks, come on now, Plus we meet the boring cast of characters the first one I'll call THE CYBORG aka Joaquin Phoenix if there was a film about a guy with no emotions and seems to play it off very well it would star Joaquin Phoenix and Keanu Reeves geez can any one say WOOD. He gives his performance with almost no incentive its like hi I'm here where my paycheck and Joaquin Phoenix is a pretty good actor in other films like Buffalo Soldiers and Quills but his performance seemed wooden. The there's the ""Mentally Challenged Character"" sorry Brody but I'm not even going to point out how you ruined this one ""one hint though there a difference between being mentally challenged and being stupid and Brody performance was stupid. Adding shame to the handicap is the ""blind girl"" who the audience is supposed to pity THE only pity I had for her was that she was in this movie. The movie seemed to trudge on and on and on. At one point we are seeing one of the lamest wedding sequences I have ever seen the next moment we see a character stabbed I mean if you wanted to steal someone else story at least steal a good one. The next person who deserves the (Holy crap you bored the audience to death award) would be William Hurt (Mr. Gonzo himself) he seems to be bored out of his mind to the point where he doesn't even care about the movie he like a talking prop through out the film. There a moment in the film when the audience is supposed to feel bad for Kitty walker whose just been dumped as she confesses true love. I couldn't help but laugh then I notice the entire audience was laughing that called bad storytelling I mean when someone tries to hard for one of those ""hall mark"" moments it seems to be another gag on the blooper reel Shyamalan. So I hope you all enjoy The Garbage I mean Village because all you stuck in the I'm a Bi+ch to the blockbuster need to get out and expand your mind. *out****",The Village
537,drmetal-1,Carefully Crafted,8,31 July 2004,"Night's 4th movie isn' t the most original movie story-wise. Most ofhis stories draw inspiration from past works of fiction. In fact, ""TheVillage"" is probably a rip-off of at least 2 books and maybe aTwilight Zone episode. But, it surprised me anyway andimpressed me. The 2 twists at the end were interesting. Night'smovies are so good to view for the first time, because you knowthere will be a cool twist. Unfortunately, repeated viewings areruined because you already know the twist.  This movie isdefinitely worth seeing. Night's direction is good and The Village isa carefully crafted film. Bryce Dallas Howard  is excellent, sheshould at least be nominated for something for this performance. Ilike the way Night shocks you and has you wondering what toexpect next. His movies are also classy and not vulgar. The Villagecould be shown on TV with almost no edits.",The Village

All this film is some people get fed up with the normal life and decided to go out and make a new life of there own. Then a person gets sick and a girl goes to get help, and then it's over with.If M.

The horror effekt in the movie works quit well, the thrills are good, but the ending is the most horrific, not because of its thrills, more on the count of its suddenly change in character, this i do not like!! It seems like to me that they should have kept the mood of the movie in horror, this is the part of the movie that works best, still in the end they change the whole thing in to a Sci-Fi, dumb move.

544,jazzpiano-,It's really not that bad...,7,10 August 2007,"People write the most accusatory things when they don't get what they were expecting. While not a masterpiece, it is definitely Shyamalan's best film since ""The Sixth Sense"", with the most engaging protagonist since the lovable, mature Cole Sear.""The Village"" is the story of a small community in the 1800s in Pennsylvania, living their simple lives in their utopia, under the threat of omnipresent monsters who dwell in the woods - Those We Don't Speak Of. While the social commentary of this film on American society, post-9/11, may be overly simplistic and misguided, several aspects of this film are nice. While it tends to drag a little at the end (Shyamalan likes quiet, slow moments), the pacing is generally quite good. Technical aspects, such as cinematography, acting and music and are all brilliantly executed - especially Bryce Dallas Howard's performance - she's so fun! When she laughs, it makes you smile. Her character, Ivy, is so full of joy and Howard animates her to endearing effect. Adrian Brody similarly stands out, but Sigourney Weaver is wooden throughout the majority of the film - disappointing given her reputation.Everyone should know by now that ""The Village"" was marketed completely incorrectly. In the ads, it was dumbed-down to a shock-horror using the brazenly obvious symbolic code of the colour red and some nifty, atmospheric shots through twigs. There is more to this film than twigs and red: The characters are generally well developed. Ivy is a splendid character, one of Shyamalan's better ones, especially since the devastatingly dull, stunted Rev. Graham Hess who dominated ""Signs"". Joaquin Phoenix's character, seemingly similarly underdeveloped, is revealed to be loyal and sensitive, and surprisingly masculine. Even the retarded 'village idiot', who initially seems included for comic relief, has a greater purpose in the development of the plot, with a bizarre love triangle emerging. Most of the other characters are either left untouched, or the rest is left to the audience's imagination (particularly with the elders).The music is stunningly good, and (in a rare case with Hollywood films) actually enhances plot development by being closely affiliated with the protagonist.The plot - It's been said before but I'll say it again! It's a love story. Awww, how nice. Ivy and Lucius are a cute couple, and even if you were expecting a horror film, their romance is strong enough to carry the film. However, one of my major qualms with the film lies in the plot, concerning how much time is devoted to the elders, who frankly, aren't that interesting. Interesting in concept, maybe, but the actors who played the elders were stoic and stiff! But, at the end of the day, ""The Village"" is definitely not the worst film ever made - it was made with love, with the actors going to a boot camp to learn how to perform typical 1800s activities, and a score that mirrors the protagonist's 'internal struggle'(if I can use a cliché term). However, my one criticism of M. Night Shyamalan is this: Please stop trying to rely on one shot to carry a scene. The audience goes to a film expecting just that - and if you're not using that one shot for an effect, such as suspense, please stop pretending that you're directing a play. Yes, I realise you specially cast theatre actors so they could deal with long takes - but long scenes of one take is just ridiculous. The last scene with the elders exemplifies my frustrations perfectly. But, the long take is used to great emotional effect in the scene on the porch between Ivy and Lucius. I commend Night on that scene, but I think my criticism is fair.Look, basically, you're into this kind of slow-moving, genre-hybrid, dystopian fantasy, or you're not. It's up to you.",The Village

546,howard78,A huge disappointment. Shyamalan's first poor film.,4,14 March 2005,"I have been a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan's movies since ""Praying With Anger"". Although I have never had the pleasure of meeting him, he is, in fact, a neighbor of mine. ""The Village"" is his first colossal disappointment. It falls short on many levels, in many ways. Firstly, the dialog is painful and often inane. It is hard to fathom how such a poor script got by even the most basic editing. The musical score is too loud, too jolting and not 'in tune' with what is occurring on screen. The story is a boring mess. William Hurt is a strain to watch as he speaks with painfully and inappropriately long pauses in a monotone that baffles. Signoury Weaver is wooden and plastic. Her presence detracts from the film. Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquim Phoenix are the only actors to perform with depth and feeling. They are the only saving grace of the movie and are a pleasure to watch. The gifted Adrien Brody stuck with the role of village idiot is a non-factor. The movie isn't a complete waste as Night delivers some intriguing footage from time to time, enough to keep it from being a total bore. But the tale itself is so absurd and pointless if not unjust and the 'twists' so lame that I give the film only a 4 out of 10.",The Village

Not Bad at All....,8,31 January 2005,"After some of the negative reviews and word of mouth that I've read and heard about this film, I was pleased at how interesting and coherent it actually was. I was reminded, as in most of M. Night's films, of a good Twilight Zone episode. The casting was extraordinary, full of Academy Award winners and nominees, all turning in appropriate performances. The sets and costumes looked authentic and practical also. The plot was a stretch but, skillfully, barely within the bounds of plausibility. I really liked it. The realistic 19th century rural village life was interesting and I thought the characters were appealing. The Village successfully conveyed a feeling of menace and mysterious creepiness (like the way Signs did). I guess I am glad that I did not pay 10 bucks at the theatre, but it is certainly worth a rental.",The Village
548,poehlmann,Insultingly Bad and Ultimately In Bad Taste,1,31 July 2004,"Okay, I did not expect much from this film and there were no satisfying surprises for me, either.  My wife put it best: M. Night tries to make films that will appeal to an intellectual audience but is not as smart or clever as the audience he thinks he is appealing to, so his movies just seem silly or dumb.  Anyone going to this thinking it is a horror movie is bound to be disappointed - although there are monsters in this film, it seems as if the writer/director actually FAILS to recognize them for what they are: sadly misguided misanthropes who are so smugly self-centered that they feel their piece of fabled security is worth the despicably glib manner in which they utterly fail their children... but that is another story.  This movie plays upon our collective desire for a safe place in the worst, most cloying post-9/11 way, and if it were not for some of the most wooden dialogue outside of an Ed Wood movie making this the director's most laughable film yet, there would be little to distract from the ugliness of the picture.Rarely have there been films where you find actors struggling as hard to make dialogue believable (and by the end, it is impossible to believe that the characters would have naturally talked that way).  I saw the ending reveal a mile away (from the preview even, though just because I'm a touch cynical and tried predicting what ""surprise"" ending was going to  be in store).  But forgiving that, and respecting that the director clearly uses genre material to draw his audience in with the hope of achieving something which, alas, his talent is not able to deliver, it is still hard to forgive the movie as a whole.  I will grant that it is beautifully shot and has one interesting character and maybe three good performances.  But it has a truly dreadful story, full of attempts at suspense that lead nowhere, and a sickening final act wherein the movie's true monsters present to themselves the error of their ways and completely miss the mark.  In the end, there is no moral message here, although it plays as though there is.  So much the sadder for the audience.  Leaving the theater, we heard lots of grumbling, not a single nice thing being said about the movie.  This was the Saturday night crowd.  And who are the movie's true monsters? Here's the spoiler for you: the creative team that put it together and the distributor who has marketed it for you, the moviegoing public.",The Village

Having seen all of M.Night Shyamalan's films, it seems that you don't so much watch an M.Night Shyamalan movie as much as you become a voyeur of it. There is something very intimate about the way he crafts his movies that is very personal. This is one of the joys of watching his movies. Some have complained that this movie didn't have a big shocker ending like Shyamalan is noted for; perhaps not, but who cares. The Village has such a rich atmosphere and full performances, that's as good a reason to see a movie as any, I think. No story details here, as I've no desire to rehash what's already been said; I will say that it may not be a perfect story, but it is a good story, let it stand on its own, and maybe poke us in the ribs a little about the consequences of the choices we make.",The Village

For example:HUGE SPOILER WARNING!!!I've heard many morons say ""Of all the people they could send, why would they send the blind girl?"" They absolutely must send the blind girl because she cannot see! What would happen if she saw a car? She would freak out, and the secrecy of their village would be ruined. That's why the escorts had to stop at the trail.""Why don't they just go out and find another place to live?""Because William Hurt's character, the son of a billionaire, was exposed to an enormous amount of greed, backstabbing, murder, and distrust that billionaires have to deal with.

What a stinker. What an utter bore. What a sleeper in the sense that it made me want to go to sleep. What a waste of time and money. What was it all about anyways? This was the most drawn out, overbearing, gut wrenchingly dull film I've seen in the longest time.Apparrently Mr. M. ""Night"" Shyamalan seems to think he is a legend. He must be since his name is above the name of the movie, just like in films like ""Steven Spielbergs ET"", ""Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather"" and ""Martin Scorcese's Taxi Driver"". He is so legendary that he puts a 3 minute film of himself in the extra segments on each DVD; films from his childhood showing how brilliant he was even then as an actor and director.The fact is he is very over rated. Until his body of work grows to the lengths and consistency of true greats, the addition of his name to the films titles will only be an act of ego not legend.This movie was a waste of time.

People are upset that the commercials put a different idea of the movie in their heads, then it turns out completely not what they thought they were going to see. what's wrong with that? If you like watching the same thing over and over again, M. NIght Shymalan's films are not for you.I loved ""The Village"" for every reason we watch movies: entertainment. I didn't know what was going to happen. That's a good thing. You shouldn't be scared of that. The ideas and the notion of this ""amish-like_ society is interesting because I'm sure there are people out there like the elders and have wanted to live in another world. Phoniex and Howard both played this innocent love story so well and showed that love can be pure and simple.

553,plutokennedy,Awful,2,12 December 2004,"This movie tells a boring and extremely far-fetched story. The plot does not really lend itself to the 'twist ending' approach that is a unfortunate trademark of the director. I like Shyamalan's style, but here it simply doesn't work. His earlier 'Signs' also suffered from a weak script, but at least the movie was well directed. Here, he is simply overconfident bordering on arrogant with his direction, complete with a vanity cameo. The figures simply don't hold enough interest, and the somber mood of the villagers simply does not make any sense in the context of the story as it is revealed in the end. The only standout is Bryce Dallas Howard, who may not yet be a great actress, but possesses a great screen presence full of dignity and grace. I hope that Shyamalan will take his time and find a script that is more suitable to his style for his next feature. 'The Village' can only be considered to be complete failure.",The Village
554,bilcal7-1,Intelligent and deserving of credit!,10,9 August 2004,"Shyamalan really found the right combination with Deakins behind the camera and James Newton Howard composing. The music and cinematography was just a perfect mix for me. The shots were simple and non-intrusive, yet still said so much. You can see that most every frame was narrow and tight, sort of capturing the constricted views of the village, in a way. Deakins' ""Shawshank-ian"" techniques really came through in that aspect. I loved that shot that panned out to the wide open, foggy landscape when Lucius and Ivy first kissed, almost showing how they had sort of transcended the confines of the village for a bit. As for the score, Hahn's violin parts were perfect. It reminded me of Zimmer's eerie cello composition from The Ring, only with a twist of romance.As for the acting, I really think this could have been Adrien Brody's best performance, to date (rivaling The Pianist). To me, he was quite possibly the most horrifyingly innocent character in any movie i've seen. The only thing he was missing was an M-16 and an angry drill sargeant. Bryce Dallas Howard's character was so persistent and passionate and Joaquin Phoenix's character was such a great compliment (it is very interesting to see, in the movie, how a blind person and a practically mute person can be so perfect for each other). These three characters lended to an interesting See No Evil (Ivy), Hear No Evil (Noah), Speak No Evil (Lucius) dynamic in the movie.The color said a lot, as well. The shunning of ""red"" seemed to satire the ""Red Scare"" days of American politics. Other colors just came alive in their own artistic way, coating the characters and painting the set. Shyamalan also made sure to insert his usual political/social commentary in there in other ways, though I can't decide if it was with more or less tact this time around. Either way, Orwell certainly provided some inspiration.Call me a sucker for off-beat romantic thriller's, but I have to give this movie a 10. Maybe it was the dark, vintange 1920's movie theater I saw it in that did it for me. Maybe it was that damn slo-motion sequence, I don't know. Overall, it just killed.",The Village

This summer The Village, outstanding trailer, worst movie I have seen all summer.This thing reminded me of a serious case of blue balls, you take so much time thinking about how great the experience will be, then the time comes, the girl starts in on you, teasing you slowly, slowly, slowly, then its almost as though your roommate walks into the room, or in this case the director smacks you in the balls giggles and prances off into the forest while draped in a red hood. SPOILERS. Yes a red hooded trickster is all we are treated to here, and the only logical direction is to just make the entire ending into as Hurt's character so eloquently puts it, ""a farce"". So after we find out that the assailant is no more than a retarded piano playing holocaust surviver. We are treated to an insanely uninteresting chase through the woods involving a porcupine a blind girl, and a hole . Weird, slightly off topic someone just text messaged my girl friend saying ""she never told us what his color was"" i think that was from the movie regarding Joaquin Pheonix's aura which Ivy could see. Anyways. With all of therevelations that come at the end of the movie, all we are left with is a cool idea pulled off poorly and a movie with no replay value what-so-ever. Because what made the sixth sense so great was that the twist gave a new point of view for the movie and doesn't lessen the impact of the events prier to the twist. In theVillage the twist defeats any and all reason to watch it again, the suspense is now dead, seeing as how there was never anything to be scared of. Also thelack of any real lead was evident, I figured Joaquin would take the lead but he is only in about 20 minutes total, and the others merely support, and the blind girl feels like a support with too big of a role. Overall I understand Night's intentions in giving us a massive twist ending but what he did was lose his touch, anddestroy the replay value. 5/10 - you can't deny that he does have a good idea on his hands but if he could go back and re shoot this misguided lunk ofwood nymph turd, he could possibly make this worth viewing.

I went with some friends and one of us knew the ending ahead of time - he did not like the film.  I started thinking of the guts it takes to make a movie that TOTALLY hinges on the twist near or at the end.  I believe that is the reason that alot of people will not like it.  If you know the end of the movie, it ruins it.  However, I did not know the end, and I really enjoyed it.  I figured out the twists right before there were revealed, and I now realize (for myself personally) that I don't mind being able to figure out the twists of a movie.  I really loved Night's movie ""Signs"", and interestingly enough, there really wasn't a twist.  I mean, from the beginning of the movie, it looks like the visitors are aliens, and that's what they ended up being. However, in ""Sixth Sense"" there was a twist, and it was brilliant.  I am looking forward to Night's next movie, and I don't care if he decides to put a twist in it or not.  He has proven to me that he can make a movie with or without a twist.

557,Nightscream,"M. Night Shyamalan's worst movie yet, slow and sleep-inducing in the beginning, manipulative and cheap in the end.",4,10 August 2004,"It's become clearer and clearer to me that with the success of `TheSixth Sense', M. Night Shyamalan may be just a one-trick pony. What was a well-written and well-acted drama with tension and ashock ending worthy of a classic has given way to a trilogy ofprogressively worse movies that seem created more just to justifya clichéd shock ending than to provide a coherent or meaningfulstory, and this comes to a crux with `The Village'.  Even`Unbreakable', with its snore-inducingly drab color palette andlighting, which put me to sleep at both screenings I attended for it,had a somewhat interesting human story that held up surprisinglywell when I saw it on TV recently.  `Signs', despite the sameboring first Act, villains whose actions made no sense, and plotholes big enough to drive a Mack truck through, had genuinelySCARY moments.  `The Village,' however, lacks any of thesevirtues, but whose first 35 minutes (and some intermittentmoments afterwards) is of that same flat quality that works betterthan NyQuil, and whose ending doesn't seem so much as ashocker as it does an offensive hoax.   The movie is set in (I believe) the 1800's, in an isolatedPennsylvania village surrounded by the Covington Woods, intowhich the villagers are forbidden to cross, lest they disrupt thetruce between the village and Those We Do Not Speak Of,demonic creatures that even in their first obscured appearance inthe film, do not look scary, but rather merely silly, resembling theScarecrow monster in the current story arc that just wrapped in`Batman.'  There is not a single scary moment in this film,absolutely nothing in the way of suspense, character development,or an interesting plot in the first forty or so minutes of the film, untila character's contrived serious injury requires the film's femaleheroine, Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard-director Ron's daughter), toventure forth into `the towns' to find medicine, at which point theShyamalan Shocking Revelation is revealed, which unlike those inShyamalan's previous three films, resembles more a massivescam than it does a plot twist, a scam perpetrated on both thecharacters AND the audience, and if you didn't figure out until this scene that Ivy's blindness was contrived to mesh with thiseventual plot twist, then perhaps you haven't been watching a lot ofShyamalan films.  Or many films period. Edward Walker (William Hurt) tells Lucius (Joaquim Phoenix) thathe is fearless in a way that he will never be.  Damn right, Edward. Most people who suffer from grief eventually get over it.  You andyour fellow rejects, on the other hand, were so cowardly that ratherthan face your pain, you not only retreated from society, butdecided to engineer a massive lie to your children to cover up thetruth, when you could very easily have retreated from society andlived a simpler existence without making the kids believe that theywere living in a past century, complete with silly bogeymancostumes, and your idiotic insistence on using antiquatedphrases in your speech like `fortnight.' It is at the point of this `revelation' that the entire movie doesn'tseem at all like a journey in which insight is made in terms ofcharacters or themes, or the audience is treated to even aplausible plot (Shyamalan explains that airspace is restricted overthe wildlife preserve in which the village is located, but doesn'texplain how that small group of founders transported all thebuilding materials necessary to build all those nice-lookinghomes and town halls), but just one big practical joke; a pointlessexercise in how to maintain a color-by-numbers format thatShyamalan seems to insist for all of his films, such as theobligatory Pennsylvania setting, the use of the color red as a plotharbinger (as it was in `The Sixth Sense'-in `Unbreakable' and`Signs' it was water), and of course, Shyamalan's patentedShoehorned-Into-The-Story appearance, which is thankfully kept toa minimum, as it takes the form of mostly a voice and a minorreflection in the glass door of a medicine cabinet.

558,hollyandcat,What a freaky film.,10,1 September 2004,"Personally when I watched this film, I thourougly enjoyed every bit of it.Especially the twists and turns along the way. My heart was pounding as Ivy almost fell into the deep pit and it took me by surprise when the Joquin Phonix character got stabbed as the trailers had led me to believe he was the one to go to the village. I now see that for him to go it would have been a mistake as he would have seen the outside world and all that is there. Ivy however, being blind was able to get the help they needed without breaking up the village. The very thing they went there to get away from came back to haunt them and that is why they let her go. Other people who have commented on this film obviously weren't concentrating as their comments are about things that are simple and easily answered by watching the film. Overall I found this film to be fascinating, exciting and intriguing and would recommend that you go to see it.",The Village
559,rdekoch,Heed the warning: unspeakably bad,3,31 July 2004,"Like the surprise endings which change the context of all prior events in his films, this movie is itself a twist that reveals something shocking about M. Night Shaymalan's career as a film maker: He's a hack.I liked all of his films up until this point and thought that although he couldn't seem to top The Sixth Sense he showed some promise. I will think twice before seeing his next film. Although The Village manages to generate some dread and suspense, the ending completely negates it. I was hoping for some interesting comment about xenophobia or terrorism but when the beans are spilled, the audience has been jerked around for a couple of hours with nothing to take away from the experience to really justify it.It's not entertaining or thought-provoking. The ending is unbelievably preposterous. Think Walden Two with some traces of Scooby Doo. From the moment that the contents of ""the shed that no one shalt use"" (or whatever they call it) is revealed, the film begins to get progressively ridiculous until it (thank God) ends.",The Village
560,SdwOne,Don't believe the Hype!!!,1,23 January 2005,"Mmmm...To be honest, I am very much my own man...I don't follow trends... I don't believe the Hype!!! Just because a billion people say a film is good might not necessarily mean that I will follow suit...So this opinion is VERY much my own...To start off with, I've NEVER been much of a Shyamalan fan.Now before you start to curse me... I DID think that the Sixth Sense was one of the BEST movies I have ever seen. Well directed, well acted... A totally beautiful, moving and sometimes frightening film.But what is happening here... I think... Is some kind of Director's Ego Syndrome...Shyamalans other films, including this one, have been crap... Let's face it. Perhaps his name pulls in the crowds... A bit like what a Spielberg film or a Woody Allen film would do (notice how Shyamalans' name is portrayed on the film's title). A desperate measure methinks, 'cos this movie is bad... Really bad.Now... I don't mind being tricked... Shyamalan tricked me with the Sixth Sense... It's cool... It was a damn good movie and I enjoyed the twist at the end.But now he seems obsessed with tricking us at EVERY opportunity!!! To the point of ridiculousness.I'm sorry... I don't mind having plots twisted on me but I don't like being tricked just for the sake of being tricked.I would NOT be complaining if the film was any good... But it ain't. It's bad... Slow... Laborious... AND finally... Ultimately... Ridiculous!!!This film is for Shyamalan fans only... Perhaps he knows his fans go to his movies NOT to enjoy them as such, but to try and work out the FINAL TWIST at the end... A sick game of director cat and naive film audience mouse!!!I'm sorry... But next time another Shyamalan film comes out... I for one will not buy into its hype!!!",The Village
561,DVLefferts,A Gallery of Brilliant Performances,9,30 May 2005,"Let me preface this by saying I thought this movie was very underrated. It's not that people didn't get it--they were simply expecting something else. And I would caution you to confuse disappointment with surprise.I personally thought that Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was so brilliant that I was disappointed she was not nominated for it at the Oscars. Her pouring of her emotions--the natural flow and grace of her character. She is a breath of fresh air among what many modern critics consider great acting. No, she wasn't a lost soul caught in the center of a mid-life disaster--she did not love the bottle and she did not love strange men. She was only a girl with a blindness that, rather than incapacitating her, made her stronger. She was bright, charming, and insightful...and alas, you forget it is only an act.I also thought John Hurt's performance was remarkable, as was Adrien Brody's. Although Brody's role as a mentally retarded young man was subtle and seemingly unimportant to the storyline, his presence is felt throughout the whole movie.Tremendous movie, chilling performances. And perhaps if we did not all see this as a horror film, it would not prove to be such a disappointment.",The Village

563,Craig87-1,A mystical journey,9,10 September 2009,"Last night I was watching the M. Night Shyamalan film ""The Village"" (2004) and found it to be a mystical parable. St John of the Cross, in his poems and commentaries ""The Dark Night"" and ""The Ascent of Mt Carmel"" and even in the ""Living Flame of Love"" speaks of darkness and blindness as states in which one proves the love for the Beloved. In the film, the blind young girl is the only one able to save her beloved, wounded for love of her. The Spiritual Canticle emphasizes the ""wound of love."" ""Why, since you wounded this heart, don't you heal it?"" The soul must not fear the ""wild beasts"" while going through the ""woods and thickets"" to find healing for the Beloved, just like the girl trying to avoid the ""monsters"" in the woods. In the film, the lovers pledged themselves ""in the serene night,"" ""the tranquil night."" In ""The Village"" the maidens must ""stay away"" from the ""outskirts."" The emphasis on solitude in the poems of St John, especially in ""The Dark Night"" where it says ""in a place where no one else appeared"" was similar to the scene in the film where the young maiden realizes she must make the journey alone. Only pure love and self-sacrifice in the blindness of faith can save the one she loves. On another level, I find ""The Village"" interesting for the portrayal of flight from the world. It has long been a Christian practice to withdraw into the desert to find God and peace. However, as the Desert Fathers discovered, we can never escape the our own human nature and the wounds of original sin. In the pristine refuge of Covington Wood, people fall in love with the wrong people, there is jealousy, and even hatred. The elders must keep the youngsters in line through the terrifying story of monsters in the woods, so that even in the safety of the wilderness the children are afraid. While we are in the flesh, there is no escape and the only true refuge is the Lord.",The Village
564,vsdennis,"Have to admit, I was disappointed.",2,29 January 2005,"I'm not a horror movie fan -- I really like suspenseful stories, with or without a ""twist"" ending. I thought the plot development of ""The Village"" was unfortunately predictable. I already knew about the creatures, knew about Noah's role in the activities regarding the creatures ...I did expect more from the contents of the boxes, and I'm still perplexed as to what Lucius' ""color"" was, that Ivy perceived. Was it ""the bad color,"" given her insistence on not sharing it with him? At times, though, her reticence seemed a bit playful, in which case his color was likely NOT ""the bad color,"" and I don't know what it might have been.I was disappointed in the character development given to Lucius and to Sigourney Weaver's role. Overall, I was a little disappointed.",The Village
565,presumin_ed,Twist again,8,25 August 2004,"I don't care what other reviews of this movie have said (or will say) but I'm determined to reveal only the barest details of its plot.Like director M Night Shyamalan's other movies (The Sixth Sense, for instance) it's as twisty and turny as a run-for-you-life through the seriously creepy woods that play a large part in The Village.At the risk of joking about a clever and suspenseful atmospheric thriller such as this, I have to tell you it's like Little House on the Prairie meets The Blair Witch Project.A tough one to pitch you might think, but M Night has already proven his bankability again and again (see IMDb trivia).He's written and directed all of his films (indeed, made a cameo appearance in each) and the same is the case here.The movie starts in 1897 wilderness America with the death of a child in the eponymous ""Village"". The name of the place is never revealed and it soon becomes clear that it doesn't really need one as none of its residents ever leaves and no-one ever visits. It is entirely self-sufficient.Anyone outside the village is ""those we do not speak of"" from ""the towns"". And Covington Woods, which surround the community, are just too darn scary to even step one foot into. Eerie howling sounds emit from the woods, day and night, and there are dozens of rules and legends about the creatures that roam among the trees.Even colours are part of the myth. Red is very bad and essentially banned from the village, while yellow is ""safe"".The men take turns manning a watchtower to warn of any incursions by the creatures and the whole place is ringed by yellow flags (and flaming torches at night). Yellow is the colour of cowardice and everyone in the community is in a constant state of fear.Everyone that is except Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix), a young man who asks the village elders, led by Edward Walker (William Hurt) for permission to cross the woods to get medicine from ""the towns"".Lucius (whose mother, Alice, is played by Sigourney Weaver) believes the child who died could have been saved. And, it seems, Walker's own daughter Ivy (the excellent Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of director/actor Ron Howard) went blind for lack of medical treatment.Soon there is indeed a terrifying visit from one of the creatures and eventually it's not just Lucius who wants to cross the woods. And that's all I'm saying. I think M Night (and IMDb) would be sorely displeased if I blabbed any more.Suffice to say, he puts the whole thing together beautifully. The pacing is almost perfect and he draws out the suspense in the manner of Alfred Hitchcock, one of his favourite directors.A lot of the movie has a cold, stark, disconcerted feeling  even during its lighter moments (there is some humour). There is much use of hand-held cameras and the barely-engineered sound gives the whole thing an almost documentary feeling.Indian-born, Philadelphia-raised Shyamalan became the highest-paid movie scriptwriter for Signs ($5 million) and he earns his cash here too. This movie is a thriller but the dialogue is impressive: pared-down, unsentimental and hugely effective.At one point, Lucius says to Ivy: ""You run like a boy"". She sees this as a compliment and simply replies: ""Thank you."" And later, during the scene in which they declare their love for each other, she asks if he dislikes her ""tomboyish ways"" (he doesn't).Love angles are so often tacked on to thrillers in a desperate attempt to give the characters some depth, and, as such, have the audience yawning. This one however, is actually quite moving in its uncomfortable simplicity.And, as usual, M Night drops clues around the movie to give hints at what's coming next or to cleverly make the events fit together. Go see him do the twist for yourself.",The Village

The twist is kinda bad but it doesn't make the movie bad in any way, also if you are an idiot like me and read the date on the gravestone wrong you will be really confused for most of the movie but the twist that it's set in what was present day clears up all the confusion.

568,jjamison-1,Scary? Not much.,8,27 May 2005,"I've read the postings saying this was a scary movie, and sorry, I have to disagree. There were a few scene that were a little tense, but which amounted to nothing. The worse scene for me was the scene when Ivy climbed out of the hole. I wondered how she was going to get all that mud off her clothes. I guess I've seen to many movies, but I had ""Sixth Sense"" figured out in the first 15 minutes. When I heard ""The Village"" described as a ""Twilight Zone"" movie, that secured the ending for me--- I knew what was coming. Actually there was a plot hole as big as a barn--- SPOILER ALERT! The picture that William Hurt took out of the box was modern, the clothes worn by the people looked about 1980 fashions. Ivy and Lucius looked to be in their 20's, especially him. Where was their memory of their life before they came to the village? How could the elders have mislead so many people who were old enough to remember ""real life."" Sorry--- I had thought the ending would be a little sharper--- it was like I had expected and seeing the truck was my ah-ha moment. But-- what happened when Ivy got back from town? The movie just stops. I enjoyed the acting, but the ending was a disappointment. Some sort of wrap-up was needed, but none came.",The Village
569,barry-trotter,How low can he go ?,1,12 December 2004,"Sixth Sense, I loved it; naught but a jot of originality, but superbly acted by the 3 main characters, and direction and photography were superb. Signs, zero for originality but again well acted and same for direction and Photo. Unbreakable much as Signs, but the rot is setting in. The Village, well, beautiful to watch, but stunningly bad. I have seen many people ask why such excellent actors such a William Hurt and Sig Weaver sign up for these films, well it's for the money, one bad movie isn't going to take you down. When MNS understands that it might be a good idea to adapt a great story or maybe have an idea and then get a great screenwriter to mold it then he may achieve what he is capable of.

It's a really good mystery film, however, it was promoted as a horror movie and that might make people feel weird when they watch it. It was a terrible mistake, but if you decide to see the film without prejudices, you'll surely enjoy it.The cast was very good, specially Bryce Dallas Howard. I didn't know her until I watched this movie, but I love how she plays the blind girl. I love when she gets into the woods and is attacked by the fake monster. She knows the monsters weren't real, but she remembers that there were in fact legends about them.

What I can say without doing that is that this film contains some of the worst acting, most ridiculous dialogue, dreadfully boring camera work (from the otherwise venerable Roger Deakins, no less!), and idiotic plot twists I have ever seen in a nationally released theatrical motion picture - truly worthy of Mystery Science Theatre 3000.  William Hurt...well, he's always been that way...but Weaver, Phoenix, and Gleeson (who has 3 whole scenes) are totally wasted on this movie, and Adrian Brody really should fire his agent over this steaming pile.  It's that awful.Other than being just plain boring, I will give this much away, hopefully without ruining this turkey for anyone willing to take the risk I did -- SPOLIER AHEAD, FOLKS!If you are hoping to check out a monster movie, don't get your hopes up.

From the trailer you would expect this to be a horror-movie but that's totally not true. I'm not saying that there are no thrilling moments,but they're not the main attraction of this movie. It's more about people living together in a small community and how they interact with each other. You really care about the different characters and when something bad happens to them it's as if it happened to you too! Very good acting and outstanding camerawork. The director knows very well how to build an eerie atmosphere! And the end of the movie is also a big surprise,I really didn't see it coming,and that's a rare thing these days in a time when giant blockbusters rule the cinema with predictable endings. I'm not saying that I don't like these mammoth SF-Aktion movies,in fact,I love them!

574,trypanophobic34,The Village: a lesson in morals and fears (spoiler),8,10 July 2005,"I think there were two lessons M. Night Shyamalan (cool name, by the way!) was trying to t/preach: People won't know what they don't want to know and look around you at the world today. There were no monsters. Only people. That was what they really feared all along, right? People. Someone pointed out the fact that not all the people in the Village looked young enough to be offspring of the Elders. In reality, I guess they just couldn't find enough actors young enough to look like kids or grandkids of the not-so-old-looking Elders. If you look at it from a philosophical standpoint, which I do, you can explain it like this: Maybe the Elders weren't the only ones to first settle in the Village. They all lost someone, right? The others could have gone through similar experiences as the Elders and made the same decision, to go to the Village. There they maybe, over time, forgot their other lives, and that there was any outside world at all. They didn't want to remember it, at least. Eventually they could even have convinced themselves that the ""creatures in the woods"" were real, as people will believe what they want to believe and can thus delude themselves into solidifying their fears into real, physical form, and a real, substantial reason for keeping inside the Village forever. The later generations would have nothing to say to the contrary of the established beliefs, not remembering any other kind of life. If they're aware of the logic flaws in their little Village, maybe they like to keep them quiet and live in this kind of delusion. They all suffered at the hands of the world, somehow, and they decided they'd rather be completely isolated from it than continue to belong to it. So they built this kind of utopia in the middle of nowhere, unreachable by most of the population, their main goal being to ""preserve innocence,"" as Walker says in his long, corny speech in the movie. And to keep the truth about the creatures quiet. They think the world has become too evil and, WORLDLY in general, and the only way to keep things pure is to go rustic, back to the simple ways of 1897, somehow missing the obvious fact that the world was just as worldly, men just as greedy, back then. Why don't we just go back to the ways of the cavemen, because then we'd be really pure? Also, when M. Night makes his cameo as he always does, as the head park ranger guy reading the newspaper whose reflection you see pretty obviously in the cabinet glass, he's listening to the radio and it's talking about how some people were killed or something, some bomb explosion, and the newspaper says that some other little girl got murdered, etc. It was pretty much staring you in the face, the moral lesson there. Can you be more subtle? Speaking of that too-long speech, one of the Elders (Noah's father, I think) said that ""heartache is the same everywhere."" He also said to Lucius near the beginning, if you remember, something like, ""Sorrow follows you wherever you go. There's no hiding from it,"" and looked at the box in the corner where they kept their ""dark secrets."" I think he understands that you can never really escape from sadness and that the idea of the Village itself is a sham. And speaking of Noah's father, I think Noah knew all along that the creatures were fake. I think he was the one who killed the dogs, too. If he didn't have much trouble killing Lucius, whom he seemed to have had some fondness for, I don't see that he would have had any problem skinning a few dogs. As a kind of sick prank. Walker said one of the Elders might have done it, but it seems unlikely; they couldn't have gained much by it, and none of them seemed like the dog-murdering type. Also, when the Elders go into the ""quiet room"" and discover he's gone and the floorboards dug up, one of them cries out, ""Oh...the animals!"" And if you remember, Noah always used to laugh at public gatherings, etc., when people thought the creatures were around, as if sharing some sort of funny secret with himself. You thought at first it was just because he was the village idiot and all and didn't understand the implications, when he was laughing delightedly and going, ""They're coming! They're coming!,"" but it was still a bit suspicious. He could have discovered the costume beneath the floorboards or gone into the ""forbidden storage shed"" long ago, and so found it funny that other people were scared of the monsters. Sometimes things just work out that way, that the village idiot knows the truth when all the rest are deluded... Also, it was clear he'd gone into the woods before, to fetch the ""bad-colored"" berries and whatnot, so maybe he made a habit of dancing around in the woods in his creature costume.Anyway, the film is good and rather simple (everything moves in one direction and I felt the message was pretty straightforward), as well as a little thought-provoking. Although there is not much action, it's entertaining enough, and I liked the setting. I also found the monsters to be a little creepy, even though they looked fake and moved clumsily; I can't explain it, exactly, but they are eerie.",The Village
575,mpndas213,Deeper than it seems,8,19 December 2005,"The premise of The Village may seem at first to be completely ridiculous. But if you choose not to look at it literally, practically- if the village and its people are taken as a grouping of mentally unstable people (as the photos show them to be) shielding themselves emotionally from the outside world... Then the practical faults of the movie fall aside. The brilliantly spooky, non-special camera effects and the singular ""eye"" of M. Might Shyamalan can then be enjoyed. In fact, the unique, sparse cinematic techniques work to great effect and, along with his unwavering aim on the jugular (so to speak) make him a genius of sorts in my mind. I highly recommend this film.",The Village

At least not the crappy cheap scary that is in so-called horror movies (ie Cabin Fever, Scream) that we're used to today. I enjoyed the plot and thought the performances were amazing. Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard, was quite good,Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody as well.

577,Videofilm,A Night to Remember!,8,30 July 2004,"Okay. This one is as deep as any Shyamalan production. To those who find the Night style refreshing and appealing, this one will not disappoint. But as usual it will be controversial because the Night brand is not everyone's cup of tea. This writer, director, producer has a real talent.  I really liked this one. The Village paints a very interesting portrait of the complexities of human nature. As is customary Night, the movie must unfold at its own pace. And despite comments to the contrary, Night does not waste any moments in weaving his web. As a matter of fact, anyone who says they got the full measure of this movie in one sitting: a)is far above the mental processing curve, b)took in way too much pre-flick information or c) is deluded.

578,ptarmigan,And the moral of the story is....,8,26 March 2005,"The first point I wish to make is if you have not seen this movie, avoid spoilers like the plague.This being the 100th anniversary of Einstein's theory of relativity, I hope he won't mind if I apply it to the evaluation of motion pictures.Having sat through, more or less, such drivel as Anchorman and Eurotrip, I find it difficult to understand why some ingrates would bash a competent, intelligent movie. Or perhaps they find Anchorman intellectually stimulating? I suspect the real problem is deciding what category to put this movie in. It doesn't really fit in any. There is even, dare I say it, ambiguity in the movie.But once you figure out what the point of the movie is, or put another way, what the moral of the story is, it starts to fall into place.So here is the spoiler.The moral of the story is that the problem is not society. It is people.In other words, society doesn't kill people. People kill people.And you get nut cases in small towns as well as big cities; in modern society as well as in olden days. The 20th century didn't invent murder, after all.Trying to escape from the evil cities to a simpler time doesn't solve all your problems.I remember the time a computer programmer who moved to the small, isolated (no road access)town of McCarthy, went on a rampage, killing half the town before he was finally stopped. There are plenty of small villages in Alaska that have had to deal with psychopathic bullies.The extras with the movie are interesting. The director went to great lengths to immerse the cast in the historical character of the era, which is ironic given the reality of the story. I wish more directors would do this with historical pieces.And finally, any movie with Sigourney Weaver in it can't be all bad. Not that this one is.All of the cast does a first-rate job.The bottom line: I enjoyed the movie. And the movie sticks with you for a while, giving you something to think about. This is more than I can say about most movies these days.",The Village

The music was a mixed bag because some of it was actually quite nice while other parts of the soundtrack were just cringe worthy. The acting is just bad even from some of the amazing actors this film received. It just felt like the film makers went with the first take and the actors weren't given enough time to get used to the style of speaking that was used in this film, although towards the end it seemed like some actors began to settle into their roles. The camera work was very competent and I really liked the look of the village. The characters had potential, but they weren't really given enough time to develop and they didn't really work off of each other very well. Nothing really scared me in the film because we never saw anyone actually get hurt, so the creatures never gave the illusion of being a threat.

582,vibrationsofdoom,Interesting thought on why societies are created...,8,8 December 2019,"Watching this movie going in, I had no preconceived notions. I read a small plot summary and that was it. Nowadays I kinda stay OFFa if I don't want to know much of a movie going in...This movie for me started off a little odd. The way the characters spoke in the beginning of the movie sounded quite a bit off. Ivy, declaring her love for Lucius rather foolishly, and some of the playful interactions of the multitude of younger characters put me off greatly at first. However, that is a HUGE point of the movie that is discussed later on.This isn't meant to be a horror movie, even if it is built upon the foundations of one. Mysterious creatures live in the woods just beyond the borders of this almost Amish, 19th century village. Or do they? The ""elders"" of this community all have something in common though, which you find out later when the origins of the town are discussed. And one of their ""rules"" is to never go into the forest. You can probably make out where this is headed.Without spoiling too much, the innocence of the townfolk seems a little TOO contrived. But when the pieces of the puzzle are put together, certain things like the absence of money, the isolation (seemingly) from the rest of the world and the rather playful and simplistic values of the villagers seems... It makes you think for a moment ""ah, if life could almost REALLY be like this. Hope, love and joy."" Is it NOT a utopia that many would see brought to the forefront?Except the creatures. But they aren't the real problem here; what IS the overwhelming issue is what is not known or discussed with the villagers. There was a TV show on once about a last remnant of humanity that was put to cryo sleep and awakened 4000 years in Earth's future... Without revealing anything, secrets often betray far worse issues than the ones seemingly most apparent.Overall, the ending becomes somewhat revolutionary, with further details giving you ""aha!"" moments throughout the film's final 25 or so minutes. And then once you ""get it,"" all falls into place rapidly, as long as you have been paying attention and letting the ""facts"" stack themselves up. It's kinda like watching Star Wars Episode 4, 5 and 6, and then by the time you get back around to 1, 2, and 3, on Episode 3 you KNOW what's going to happen because you've SEEN it in episode 4. Shymalan's brilliant storytelling mirrors the way Lucas chose to approach the entire Star Wars universe by starting the story practically in the middle. This isn't exactly on the same lines, but you get the idea. Memento utilized that ideology in reverse, and good storytellers can hook you in from the beginning, middle OR end. Though simplistic, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit.Will probably have to go back and watch it again to see even more ""aha!"" moments...",The Village

584,sohn717,underrated.,10,12 August 2018,"It's far from a perfect film, but I have to give it a 10 to combat the mediocre ratings because of a collective bias against M. Night's hit-or-miss films. The twists and reveals aren't as satisfying as those of The Sixth Sense, and there's some unfortunately shoddy editing in the climactic scenes (all those establishing shots of the forest take us out from the tension...)But this movie is my go-to example for how to portray romance. Writers take note. There are various forces that keep the two lovers apart from each other throughout; it's through DISTANCE, rather than through kissing and sex scenes, that keeps the tension strong. and that tension only adds to the thrills. And the violin score is equally thrilling, haunting and gorgeous. One of the most beautifully scored films ever.Does it deserve a 10? No but somewhere between 7.0 - 7.7 would be more fair.",The Village
585,joy314,"A beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted story",8,1 May 2005,"Forget the jaw-dropping last minutes of The Sixth Sense. And don't expect the clever, subtle plot device of Signs. See The Village with an open mind and no expectations.M. Night Shyamalan's latest film has been, first of all, undermined by a totally misleading trailer and, second, sabotaged by viewers expectations that every film he gives us will have a pull-out-all-the-stops twist ending.The Village is a beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted story whose message is simple and direct. The ending is not so very hard to guess but you'll have a better time if you don't try and just enjoy a well-told tale. And should you suspect you know where its all going, it doesn't really matter. It doesn't detract from the beauty - and the message - of the film.(SPOILER FOLLOWS) We carry our humanity with us -- with all its dignity and divinity, all its baseness and flaws -- wherever we go. We cannot wall it out. Within The Village exists love, hate, fear, sickness, death, mental illness, strong emotion and crimes of passion. The ""towns"" outside of the village contain kindness and compassion even as they also contain tragedy and inhumanity. The Villagers have, in the end, left nothing behind.",The Village
586,Booyah,The Village: Quality film - now get off Shyamalan's back.,8,31 July 2004,"Unfortunately a good percentage of people are judging this film based on their view of writer/director Shyamalan, his previous films, and their expectations.The problem with doing that is that it's nearly impossible for this film to please anyone with a strong preconception. If you're not a Shyamalan fan, you're going to be tired of twists. If you are a fan and expecting one, it's not going to have the same effect on you as The Sixth Sense. If you want a twist or DON'T want a twist, you're going to be hard to please.So leave all that at the door and just enjoy the film, and base your impressions on how the film stands up on its own accord.As in Signs and Unbreakable, Shyamalan leaves you guessing (you weren't really ""guessing"" in The Sixth Sense, unless you were forewarned the movie had an unexpecting twist). Those two previous films build up the suspense in a way such that you KNOW something dramatic has to come forward to explain things.The ""twist"" here isn't really one thing but several, which I won't reveal. The cynicism you may view the village, its customs, its fears, and its elders is toyed with constantly.In the end, this is another psychological thriller, but it operates on a different level than you may be expecting. That may disappoint or please you. If you stop setting expectations for this film, you'll probably see things as I have: this is a quality film that rewards your attention, fits together well, and makes you think.I do feel the script may be a little light. It seems like the kind of story that could be told just fine in an X-Files, Twilight Zone, or Outer Limits episode in 23-42 minutes. The film is ""stretched"" to two hours. But it's understandably stretched. Beautiful scenery, music, performances by the cast, and tension...lots of tension, fill the space.The cast is almost overstocked with award-winning actors and actresses. Out of this ""all-star"" line up, an unknown shines brightest. Bryce Howard really steals her scenes. One almost expects that Shyamalan fills time with half a paragraph in the script that basically says ""Bryce: Wow us for a few minutes."" William Hurt and Cherry Jones (you may remember her as the police officer in Signs) are also very effective. The rest of the cast is solid.The music and visuals are great - a real pleasure to take in.The unfortunate fact is people are rating this ""pass or fail."" The most popular rating for this film is a ""10."" The second-most popular is a ""1."" No one can justify either of these extreme scores. They either walked out pleased or disappointed, and let their emotion (and desire to influence the overall rating) take over.Overall, I rate it an 8/10. It's a combination of a well-made film that entertains. It doesn't wow you like Spider-Man, nor is it the modern day equivalent of Citizen Kane. But it gets the job done, and does so on a level that far exceeds most garbage that Hollywood produces.",The Village
587,jayhawk-18,So many problems!,1,25 August 2004,"If you've not seen it, I can't recommend it (it's one to rent). Read on only if you want the plot spoilt or, like me, had lots of questions about how the plot bears scrutiny.I knew going into the movie there had to be a twist and knowing that the villagers couldn't leave the village made my mind race with possibilities. It turns out the village is NOT a human zoo aboard a spaceship. Maybe that would have made the film more interesting.You can tell from the opening scene that the cemetery looks old. The fence is skewiff and has not been painted for awhile. This seems very uncharacteristic for such fastidious people. The village seemed far too prosperous for being a backwoods type of place. In that era even glass windows were a luxury, so to see a widow living alone with her son in a huge rambling house seemed very unlikely.Their stories of 'the towns' seemed horribly over the top. Those boxes of secrets in their homes were casually left in full view. And does this village never get anyone passing by, or any hunters or trappers going through their woods?So we have a bunch of emotionally scarred people playing at being Victorian re-enactors thanks to a billionaire's fortunes. How did these city folk take to living off the land so easily? Wouldn't the killing of their livestock mean a huge threat to their livelihood (who WAS killing the livestock and WHY?). And just how many children did these handful of people manage to have?You can see why I found it so unsatisfying with all these questions. Plus the leaden dialogue. Plus seeing the blind girl run through the woods at full pelt. Plus the convenience of having all the bad and inexplicable things being done by the village idiot. It prevented me from enjoying the symbolism the story is obviously trying to represent about America's position in the world.",The Village

Never again!The idea of the movie wasn't so bad, but the idea never got developed into anything worthwhile.There was absolutely nothing in that film that I remember as thrilling or exciting, and around half of the film I was debating to leave, and just stayed because I wasn't sure if my girlfriend liked it or not.",The Village

When the main character dies in the first 45 minutes, you should know right then that the movie is screwed.  M. Night Shyamalan should have stuck with his Bruce Willis partnership.  At least he and Sam Jackson made Unbreakable watchable, and he can never top the Sixth Sense, so he should just give up.  This movie, in a way, pokes fun at his last outing, Signs, but it is definitely not worth watching at all.  Email me with ""The Village"" in the subject line if you wish to discuss this further.

After this..take a deep breath(feeling all mighty and proud of how incredible of a movie buff you really are) and proceed to get a life. The problem is that the new breed of ""movie buffs"" raised on Hollywood ""terrors"" such as Scream and I know What You Did Last Summer are getting progressively worse and worse each year at recognizing true cinema and the elements that really make a movie a cinematographic experience and not just some sort of a sporting event where the viewer tries to figure out the plot while ignoring the movie elements themselves. People..PAY ATTENTION TO THE MOVIE AND ITS ELEMENTS. How about atmosphere,camera work,surrounding scenic beauty.Most of the clowns on here who bashed this flick probably talked to their buddy throughout the whole movie ignoring all of these aspects. Ending..(very good one here,by the way) is the icing on the cake and DOES NOT MAKE THE WHOLE MOVIE! Great flick full of powerful acting,fantastic dark atmosphere and twists that are not just there for twists-sake but actually make the story great.I loved it.I thought Sixth Sense was ok and Signs sucked by the way.

I seriously enjoy the old suspense movies of the Hollywood Golden Age.  This movie is comparable to something Hitchcock would make if he were alive today.  Seriously.  The SINGLE BEST movie I've seen in a decade.  If you understand what M. Night is doing and look at it from the cinematographer's and director's point of view, and know that you are simply a passanger on their preconceived ride, (as Hitchcock believed) then you'll truly enjoy this masterpiece of cinema.If you don't care for that type of genre, then of course, you won't enjoy any of the old Hollywood Legend movies, and you won't enjoy this one.",The Village

Should have been a bit of an eye-opener for the clueless and naive people of the world (most conservative people in the U.S. in particular).Pretty good movie, had to watch it a second time to pick up on things I missed.

593,hall10000,Let's twist again...,6,8 September 2004,"THE VILLAGE by M.NIGHT SHYAMALAN.End of summer, slow movie, lack of substance and everything wrapped together with a twist can only mean one thing, SHYAMALAN is back. They said if he wants to do horror he does the SIXTH SENSE, fancy super heroes...he does UNBREAKABLE and when he wants to do a shitty movie he does SIGNS, his movie career has gone downhill into oblivion as did my vote of confidence. ANGEL HEART and THE USUAL SUSPECTS worked because the story leading to the twist can stand on it's on feet regardless of the end so did THE SIXTH SENSE whose replay value went through the roof if only to check some loose ends. So now we are going deep into THE VILLAGE, the first ten minutes bring back a strong anxiety feeling very close to the panic attack wondering if TWISTA can possibly bores us to death yet again, then as the story unfolds fear turns into interest and then into fear again but because of the good reasons. A village surrounded by woods, something lurks in the dark but they won't bother us if we don't bother them, looks simple? believe me it is not. So we have the story, what else do we need? Actors, come in la creme de la creme WILLIAM HURT and ADRIEN BRODIE and top that with and almost silent performance from PHOENIX can we ask for more?... the cherry of the cake is newcomer HOWARD playing the blind girl that at some point will not only be leading the movie but also the audience into the darkness and finally the real deal of the movie, the village itself. We will soon discover that apart from the vastness of the ocean in OPEN WATER, walking the woods at night is the most scary thing to do, I know is irrational after all who is gonna be hiding there monsters? guess what, there are. Now the weakness... the monsters are introduced as ""the ones we do not speak of"", now this point can border the unbearable at some stages, wanting to slap a couple of characters, specially PHOENIX, well is always PHOENIX isn't it. Secondly Mr SHYAMALAN secret which I won't reveal let's just say that looks like he has work the story backwards closing every single detail.One thing is for sure this movie is not everyone you will either love it or hate it but the movie will grow on you if you let it. As for the director's trademark I can say without the shadow of a doubt that his cameo is the most ingenious ever, HITCKOCK or otherwise.

594,fabibi,What a shame !,1,19 August 2004,"This movie is simply awful. I just don't get it : how could such a great director do such a lame movie ? I had guessed the whole plot and the so called shocking ending just two minutes after the movie had begun. Plus, this is absolutely not scary at all. I know Shyamalan says everywhere that he didn't plan to make a scary movie but a love story, but the thing is, when your whole marketing campaign is based on the ""horror of the unseen"", that's a pretty lame argument and an awful way to fool the audience. And I'm sorry to say, the love story, as it is, is a sad bore. We've been told this kind of love story a thousand times, and most of the time it was better than this. Now, the acting : Adrien Brody is not going to prove he deserved his best actor Oscar with THAT. He's completely ridiculous in a role that's, sadly, completely pointless and was probably written to fill all the holes in the screenplay. Poor Joaquin Phoenix has not much to do and he disappears in the middle of the movie (maybe he begged the director for that ? ""Please, write me off this movie !!!""). Sigourney Weaver is non existent. The only good thing of ""The Village"" is the luminous Bryce Dallas Howard. You can say she's going to have a great career just for being able to go through this whole movie with dignity and grace. Now, Shyamalan, enough with so called twisty endings and pseudo thrillers that scare no one. Even Steven Spielberg knew that the miracle that ""Jaws"" was could not be made twice. So stop doing ""The Sixth Sense"" all over again and try something new !",The Village

I thought Signs was one of his best...I had high hopes for this one as the trailer (which I've seen 15 billion times in theatres and TV) was showing the potential for another excellent movie from him.  Well this is the case where the trailer was totally misleading as to what the movie was about.  When the `twist' was revealed, I could've gotten up and left the theater right then and there.  The ONLY thing that kept me there is I'm a fan of  Joaquin Phoenix.  He was excellent in his role as Lucius.  Also, I was blown away by Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal of Ivy.  The acting was very good in the movie, but the storyoh manif the movie was about what the trailer was showing us all these many months, this could've been an awesome movie..",The Village

597,msrchuk,Beautiful implausibility,7,12 May 2005,"I enjoyed this movie a lot, and I'm sure most people will. Forget the fact that Shyamalan's movies famously have a twist (anyway this has two, albeit one is fairly obvious), otherwise you may be disappointed. You must take this movie on its own merits, not as a Shymalan work, then it has a lot to be commended. The cast is pretty impressive: nice to see William Hurt playing a lead character again, ably supported by Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, and others. However the undoubted star is Bryce Dallas Howard. In the early scenes, she doesn't impress very much with her ""blindness"" - she focuses on people too obviously - but this improves as the movie runs. Apart from this however, I think she plays the part beautifully. She is luminous in most shots, and holds your attention constantly. She should be a major star soon on the basis of this performance.The landscapes are framed and shot as you would expect from this director, with clever use of colour and especially shadow. I didn't spot a single anomaly in the settings, and the soundtrack also fits well.So what's the implausibility? *** SPOILER FOLLOWS *** A community like this would simply not be possible - OK, we don't know until the last part that we're in the present day, but even one hundred years ago, I'm sure that such a place would have had visitors.Anyway, you should suspend disbelief and enjoy all the good things; Ms. Howard in particular.",The Village

Then, like many, I wanted to go right back in and see it again.  I wouldn't say that about The Village but I did really like it.  The many little mysteries inside the mystery was just as much fun to contemplate as the movie overall.  Several scenes surprised me as did the ending.  (Possible spoiler)  One ""love scene"" speech caused an audience member to go AWW real loud and caused a giggle across the audience as we were all thinking aww, we just didn't say it out loud.

Why is the movie still going on? why am I no longer interested in what happens? Why are the best characters so under developed? I hate seeing a great idea never realize it's full potential.This is a good movie for about an hour, but after that any suspense that had built is needlessly dissolved. This leaves a shell of what was a good movie, with no reason to continue watching.A light shines in the character of Ivy, the one character you ever get the chance to care about in the movie.. yet due to lack of proper development, again you are left wanting more.

All things that make a thriller right? I challenge anyone in THE UNIVERSE to show me any moment in this movie which fills ANY of those criteria. It is NEVER scary, the suspense lasts as long as a good fart and as for the twist....was that it?!!?! the fact that the twist is actually revealed half an hour before the end (there are no monsters) wastes the final 30 minutes of my life even more than the opening 90. this film is so bad i questioned my desire to ever go the movies again. the main actor gets confined to bed after half an hour after saying less words than a 2 month old baby and the mad cap twist is so not twisted its straight as a ruler.what the hell!!?! mental patients living in a wood? giant area of land where no one ventures, using the monsters to prevent people escaping?!?! rubbish rubbish rubbish. If the story (as the trailers make it seem) did involve J.Phoenix wandering into the woods to challenge the beasts all blair witch style, that would have been scary. if the story was the beasts coming to the town more often, that would be scary. the beasts being real would have been scary. in fact, the smurfs appearing in hockey masks and chainsaws would have been scarier. the director of this movie should be banned from directing ever again and the funding that goes into his projects should be given to ideas by good writers and directors, not mental people who give themselves crazy middle names and write thrillers with no thrill and twist movies without a twist. rubbish 1/10",The Village

This is one big contender for the 2005 Oscars, no matter what people say.First of all i like to highlight a key point in the movie:Ivy Walker - one who can't see (see no evil) Lucius Hunt - one who can't speak (speak no evil) Noah Percy - one who can't hear (hear no evil)As the movie is set in the age-of-innocence, the MNS tried to discuss about what have we done to innocence, why we sometimes create our own fear and the question as to whether we should lie to cover up truth of life.The cinematography is top-notch with fine performances from all actors.

I got this CAN I GET MY MONEY BACK (OR AT LEAST SOME OF THE MONEY) BECAUSE THIS WAS NOT WHAT I WANTED TO SEE? feeling. I felt like WHY?THE VILLAGE is undoubtedly an excellent peace of work about sociology. Is shows how people want to protect their child from what they think is not good for them and what they are willing to do to reach for love. But it is NOT a GOOD movie. It is TOO LIMP!But what should Night do? He can't tell you in the trailer, that the monsters do not exist. How many people would have watched it than? I guess less than they did now?I don't know how to describe it, but this movie felt like NOTHING and I do not want to see it another time, even if you would pay for it.Night you will have to write a better story and script to impress me!! And for all you who think that a story needs a U turn to be impressive, it does not. Earlier movies did not have such things and future movies will later drop it too. This is just a habit of our generation as writers seem to enjoy this and always try to build such stories and fail to focus on the more important things.And now to the actors and actresses. I already told you that Bryce Dallas Howard was great. But Joaquin Phoenix failed to attract my attention. This was not one of his best performances.

The most common one is that they were expecting it to be a horror movie, and it turned out to be something entirely different than what it seemed to be. This is also the reason why I was disappointed, but not necessarily because I was tricked into watching it, while I wanted to see a horror movie. It's more because it had a lot of potential be a great horror movie. I liked the idea of the 'fake' plot about the creatures from the woods, and the truce being over. I really liked it. Durring the time when it still seems that the creatures are real, when they start invading the village, I found it pretty scary. It had a great atmosphere. Then the drama came, with all the boring dialogue, and I started to realize how much potential this movie wasted. That's why I am disappointed.

The thrills or trick ending is not what makes this a great film but the emotional investment that you put into this film and it's great characters is what does the trick. There is a wonderful slow motion scene about half way thru the film that is scary, gorgeously filmed, and exciting all in one.

When I was a child I was (okay, I still am) a huge fan of the Beatles. As each record came out I was constantly blown away by the progress of their ideas and music. I remember when the album ""Revolver"" came out, I invited some kids from my neighborhood to listen to it with me for the first time. I was the only one in the room who enjoyed it. Some of my friends disappeared before the album was over, muttering things like, ""I liked 'A Hard Day's Night' better...why have they become so weird?""I think this may be the plight of M. Night Shyamalan. Many want him to do ""The Sixth Sense"" over and over again, or at least something that resembles it. ""The Village"" is a movie that if (1) it had not been marketed the way it was and (2) did not reveal the director (yeah, I know, it could never happen), would have more likely been embraced for what it was - a remarkable movie.Bryce Dallas Howard plays the unlikely heroine, Ivy. Unlikely because she is blind, yet shows the greatest bravery among a village of people who live in constant fear. Howard's performance blew me away. The characters, all brilliantly portrayed, display a common thread of fear and emotional restraint, and acceptance of remaining in this state. All but Lucius (played by Joaquin Phoenix, so often typecast as an unlikable character; he shattered that in this role) and Ivy, as is established as the story unfolds.I don't want to give any more away than I have. See this movie.I am guilty of almost not seeing is BECAUSE of the trailer, but I'm glad I did. This is one of the best, most thought-provoking movies I have seen in recent times.Forget what you've read, and who directed it (though the direction is excellent) and give it a chance.

A young man, Lucius, and a young blind woman, Ivy find love in the midst of the chaos. This movie proved to be extremely interesting. At first the premise makes it seem as if it will be yet another boring, predictable movie, but M Knight proves against this idea. I would recommend this movie to somebody as long as they're not afraid of the monster who may be hiding in their closet.",The Village

A few people have told me that I am supposed to have thought the movie was set in the past and be surprised when it was the present day. Was there really anyone who didn't know this from the beginning?Moderately watchable but ultimately disappointing.The acting was fine throughout, everything was appropriately tense, but overall it felt more like some reject episode of the X-Files than anything to get truly excited about.Somehow I think The Sixth Sense was an anomaly, as everything since has started with promise but ultimately turned out to be decidedly mediocre.",The Village

Ms. Howard's and Mr. Phoenix's actions and emotions made this movie worthwhile for me. Yes, if you ponder deeply the actions of the elders you could be upset with this movie. But for me I keep bits and pieces from movies. The warmth the love story in this movie gave me was what I'll keep. Yes, I thought about things like ""what would happen if a plane flew overhead"". Or ""how cruel to have your children scared of something that doesn't exist"". But come on, this movie told a story. A good and imaginable story. If you put yourself in Ivy's shoes and face what she does how can you not admire her and her heart. Almost a day after watching the movie for the second time I'm still warm.

I found this movie interesting with a cool twist that I didn't see coming. At its core is a traditional love story, along with exploring the psychology of fear in a community where the world around them seems beyond explanation. When you think of all we know in modern society, all that we have explained and can control, you wonder how fear influenced the lives of those who existed in a more ""innocent"" time. It begs the question, is it better to know, or to hold onto innocence?{SPOILER}""It sounds a lot like a 20th century guy writing what he guesses 18th century people might have talked like"" Um, YEAH, that is the point. These are people who grew up in the 20th century and are pretending it's 1897. If you don't see the end then you think the dialogue is weird and the monsters are cheesy-looking.

613,Alfredo_Griselda,Those of Whom We Do Not Speak,8,10 September 2009,"The Village is M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film and it's a hard one to review without giving too much away. Shyamalan has made a niche for himself delivering movies (Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense) that pack a surprise punch at the end, and The Village is no different. The film takes place in a village set in a valley ringed with a forest. The time is indeterminate, although the clothes are old fashioned, as are the houses and furniture. There is a shot of a tombstone in the cemetery early on in the film that shows a date of 1897, and the village certainly wouldn't be out of place in the 19th century. The form of speech of the village citizens is also somewhat archaic. As the story unfolds we learn that the village exists in a state of uneasy truce with the creatures living in the forest around them. The creatures, whom the villagers refer to as Those of Whom We Do Not Speak, apparently are attracted by the color red, as the villagers shun that color, even going so far to uproot and bury wildflowers of that color. The villagers maintain a ring of poles with yellow flags by day, and torches by night to keep the creatures out of the village. They also maintain a watch tower, where a sentry watches through the night. About all the sentry can do, though, is ring a bell to alert the villagers to hide in their cellars when the creatures decide to enter the town. The village elders, who are the town's governing body, are also concerned about the repeated occurrence of skinned animal carcasses showing up in the valley. That's the background and the starting point of the movie, which is basically about the love between the quiet, soft-spoken Luscious Hunt, well played by Joaquin Phoenix and the independent, but blind, Ivy Walker, wonderfully played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Both Phoenix and Howard are marvellous in their roles, and are surrounded by a great cast including William Hurt as Ivy's father Edward Walker, Sigourney Weaver as Luscious's mother Alice Hunt and especially Adrien Brody as the mildly retarded Noah Percy. One of the real treats of this movie is watching how these strong characters interact with each other. Shyamalan did an outstanding job directing the cast, and a phenomenal job of filming. Every shot is well thought out, and only shows you what he wants you to see. Especially powerful are the shots of the creatures, for the most part mere suggestions of figures in red, Shyamalan lets your imagination fill in the rest. The brooding autumnal forest around the valley makes for especially powerful images. The green and austere village fits in perfectly with it's surroundings. Shyamalan's use of strange angles really help to create the mood and bring out the best in his storytelling. Above all Shyamalan is a craftsmen, and The Village is a well-crafted film. Some may guess the secret before the end, but no one can doubt that this is a powerful story of love, well acted, and well filmed.",The Village
614,davidguest,A masterpiece,10,12 December 2007,"Please try not to believe the other comments on this film, if you have half an ounce of intelligence and like to be challenged then you will love this film.It is not a horror film in the sense that the masses see a horror film. It is horrific, but not in a violent way. It will have your heart racing in places, your head spinning in others. It is truly inventive and does not (unlike sooooooooo many films these days) rely on special effects to make it interesting. It relies on some brilliant acting performances, screenplay of the highest standard, and a story that is well thought out and brilliantly executed.Other people on here have slated this film for delivering a weak and predictable twist, I didn't see it coming. I think it's strong and it has a kind of two-tier effect.I would strongly recommend this film. In my mind, it is a modern classic.",The Village
615,demon-drifter,The Containment,7,3 February 2007,"M. Night Shyamalan has produced a decent film in The Village. It is interesting how he has used the village and its people as a metaphor to show how fear can keep us imprisoned, contained and controlled. It takes a rebellious mind to break free. It is also striking to see that people could theoretically be contained within a time period. We see the village living in medi-evil times while a few short kilometers away the rest of the world lives in the 21st century. It is an intriguing film to watch and attempts reasonably to get the audience to feel the fear of the villagers. It is a worthwhile film for those who like twists and turns. M. Night Shyamalan has become somewhat of an Alfred Hitchcock with his cameo appearances, and with films like The Sixth Sense he is not too far off.",The Village
616,vsix1,I Felt Cheated -- Minor Spoilers,6,18 January 2005,"I loved the Sixth Sense. I loved Unbreakable. Signs I would not miss. The Village...I would not visit.Rather than being a witness to an outstanding filmmaker, The Village pays homage to excellent marketing. The trailers for the movie (and I know the old argument about judging a movie by its trailer) paint the film out to be a thriller. And there were at least two times in the movie where I was frightened. But come on...I expected much more.The movie can be seen as an allegory of isolationism and its effects on people. The idea of isolation to except the pressures of a world gone mad are as old as time. But what is particularly horrific in this case is that the adults in the village have misled their own children into thinking that they have been born into a different time. They have, in effect, robbed their children of the freedom to make their own decision and to track their own course in life. Maybe the children would be stronger for having to endure the grief their parents ran from. But, because of the justified dishonesty that the parents practice, we (and they) will never know.When I have told friends about the movie, I am asked the same question: why was it promoted as a horror film? Because if people knew the real story of the film, they wouldn't care to see it. I guess I can't fault Shyamalan...like me, he has bills to pay.",The Village

It is amazing what a good director can do with great actors: ""This is all I can give you....."" "" I accept."" When that brings tears to one's eyes something right is going on. I still have some minor reservations with the first few minutes of the film. I had to let myself into this other world of religion/tradition/community. It is perhaps the costumes, etc. I must admit these are things I do not warm up to readily. The performances, scenery, metaphors, imagery, development is all top notch. (Afrter the first 10-15 minutes of adjustment, like Shakespeare perhaps)All in all I find this to be on par or above Sixth Sense and certainly equal to Unbreakable( Mel's politics ruined Signs for me).",The Village

All the other cast was very good, too.I enjoyed every second of this and thought it was great. Don't listen to all the senseless blabbering on here. Most people just form their opinion about what others say.

I avoided Unbreakable in theaters for this reason, only to discover it was a pretty decent movie when a friend showed me the DVD. I really enjoyed Signs, simply because of the directors three movies, it relied the least on a big twist ending. The Village has not one, not two, but three big twists and none of them help support this lame attempt at suspense. The acting is horrible, the script laughable, and the big twists only make you feel like Mr. Shyamalan needs to be stopped at any cost. Once again, the big surprises are so obvious that a five year old could figure them out, this may have been OK if anything that preceded these events were even remotely worth sitting through...but they are not. Ol' M. Night shows how completely full of himself he is by including a ridiculous Hitchcock style cameo near the end...when you are simply praying for the credits to role...and it only serves to remind you that Hitchcock he ain't...do yourself a favor...read some spoilers and save your money...the big surprise it not worth the pain and total boredom you will suffer to get to it.",The Village
622,iamthebeatles,M. Night Shyamalan: Setting Priorities,7,2 October 2004,"I went all alone yesterday to the movie theatre to watch The Village. I must say that I was drawn by the all star cast and the aesthetically beautiful movie poster. I haven't liked Signs though, I thought it was boiled eggs. To be objective I consider Shyamalan a conceptual director meaning that he has very interesting themes. He's a master in portraying these themes in terms of motifs and symbols visually and verbally throughout the film, but he has two problems with his screen writing techniques and that's due to NOT setting priorities. When I watch his film, I sense at times that he's a very commercial director who plays with sudden/sleazy sound effects just for the thrills, but at other times I see interesting personal themes portrayed. You can't gain both audiences, Shyamalan: the majority and the minority. Honestly, he succeeded in doing so, but he has a potential of being an artistic writer, why care for the bucks? You had them already. To emphasize, he doesn't set the world of the film. Is this film about plot? Character? or Theme? I noticed that plot and theme were fighting, and character was vanishing throughout. As a director, I don't think of him very highly. I think some scenes are like boiled eggs: the use of long useless shots and uninteresting decoupage.To summarize, he's a potential screenwriter with very interesting personal themes who has to set his priorities. And if you will direct, Shyamalan, FOCUS.",The Village

I watched this for the first time yesterday and was completely blown away. I went in expecting a horror film but it turned out to be a very well done thriller. As you start to believe one thing Shyamalan throws you another curve ball. I really appreciate the focus on the villagers. The film focused more on building relations with the characters within the village rather than focusing solely on the creatures. A lot of symbolism and literary terms within the film which I appreciate. The Village seeks your attention and your mind rather than just your wits and reaction. Its about understanding the people and understanding the story. I thought it was very well done. This movie was an almost perfectly made thriller. I would of thrown in some more creepy scenes but other than a few scares the movie is perfect. Underrated and misunderstood, The Village stands as one of the best Thrillers in years!",The Village

Oh if only there would have been something supernatural in this movie, or some creatures in the woods surrounding the village....indeed if only!!!! The only supernatural thing I could find is the fact that the village and the surrounding woods seems to be cut of from the world by a big wall,at least judging by the fact that the blind girl Ivy Walker has to climb her way out of the woods over a wall and back in with a ladder?????????????? And of course she is lend a helping hand by a nice wildlife guard""Kevin""! Who must be thinking that he just walked into a nutcase escaped from Gothika or something like that but helps her anyway.

625,Liquid-Snake,Just watch it and learn something,8,19 September 2006,"I've just watched the movie for the first time and I have a confession.I knew there were a lot of people who didn't like this film. I knew there was going to be a twist at the end.What I didn't know that I would spoil the film for myself.I had completely forgotten about the supposed year of 1897 shown at the start, so while I was watching the rest of the film I tried to work out the twist based on how the village related to the present-day. My very first suspicion was that the village was some sort of sociological experiment that kept a community living as if was the 18th or 19th century. I wasn't too far off. The revelation that it was 2004 failed to shock me (I thought it was the present-day all along not because I actually worked it out but because I had no reason to believe otherwise).When I found out about the tombstone's date all I could think was, ""What was the need for giving us that information?"" It would have made no difference if we didn't know it was 1897 and it slightly devalued the film. It was a bare-faced lie to fool us. But because fate allowed me to ignore the lie, I am not angry. It shows our friend Shymalan made a huge error. What if there are others who have perhaps missed the opening minute? As an experiment, show this film to someone (with some degree of intelligence) who hasn't watched it before, but from after the funeral scene. I bet they won't find the it's-2004-twist surprising.For me this film was about innocence lost and going to great lengths to regain it. It was an extreme thing to do, but understandable. Adrien Brody's character harboured the two sides of every human in their extremes - the completely innocent and the insanely violent.The connotations become more and more obvious as you think about the film, which in the end is a very entertaining commentary on the modern-day world.Despite everything, a very good movie.",The Village

An A+ for sure.Usually I don't like films that drop you into a story, setting, environment, etc. and that take a long time filling you in with what's going on. With this film that is actually part of the magic. There is so much mystery about what is going on in an around this village, who are these people, and what is out there that they are so afraid of. You are constantly guessing as to what is going on, but it doesn't distract from enjoying the film.The gray atmosphere (it's always cloudy), the spookiness, the mystery are all at appropriate levels.

Alright, I can see disappointment, but being angry that ""The Village"" wasn't scary does not qualify it as the ""worst movie ever."" Lord, if you've seen Chronicles of Riddick, you know that the Village isn't even in the same league as the other contestants for the Worst Movie Ever. Frankly, I thought it was a very well made film, with fine acting and a storyline that was concerned more with making you think than with making you jump. Shyamalan weaves an intricate plot that conveys a profound statement on facing fear in its many forms. Beyond any cheap dime-store horror movie plot, he tells a story based on character development and atmosphere. The cast is stellar. Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix give standout performances as the hopeful youths who think beyond their small village, while William Hurt some of the best acting he's done in recent years. The score by James Newton Howard is beautiful and greatly enhances an already solid film. My only complaint lies with the way Adrien Brody's character is finally dealt with. I won't give anything away, I just wasn't really pleased with that. Anyway, if you're going expecting a scary monster flick, of COURSE you'll be disappointed. Wait a week for Alien Vs. Predator if that's your idea of good movie-making. However, if you want to see something a bit more subtle and much deeper, go see the Village. My Rating: 8/10",The Village
629,trelloskilos-1,A great comedy. What do you mean it wasn't supposed to be funny?,3,18 December 2004,"OK, I've watched ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"", even ""Unbreakable"", and whilst Shyamalan's films have all been a bit hit-and-miss, ""The Village"" really sets an unprecedented low.The plot focuses on a village completely surrounded by a forest full of monsters who seem to be attracted to the colour red. The villagers live with the monsters in an uneasy truce, neither of them infringing on the borders. However, when skinned baby animals start appearing from nowhere, the villagers suspect that someone has breached the borders and angered the monsters.In the village, live Ivy, a blind girl, and Lucius. A quiet, but mature boy. The majority of the plot centers on them and their developing relationship in the midst of the potential peril.OK, the plot seems capable enough. The storyline does have a twist or two, but the film made me burst out laughing unintentionally several times. (Not a good thing, especially if the film is supposed to be creating an 'ambience'). The actress who played Ivy could not have done a worse job in portraying her blindness. Clumsily fumbling around while stationary, and confidently running through unknown territories, negotiating obstacles and not hitting a single thing. You've got to see her turn corners and wave her stick around. So appalling was this that I found myself sniggering several times over.Secondly, the dialogue was very long and drawn-out. I know it's supposed to be set in the late 19th century, so the English is very ""olde worlde"", but surely even during this time, people didn't take 30 seconds to deliver a single line.There are films which do take a while to build up some sort of suspense, then deliver a payoff for the audience's patience. Takashi Mike's ""Audition"" is a great example (although the payoff was a little more gory). Unfortunately, the payoff in ""The Village"" was a flat, and fairly predictable twist. I pretty much knew there was a twist coming, guessed what it was, and surprisingly, was right. Unlike Shyamalan's other films, this twist has been done before.Perhaps I found this film so funny because I was expecting some form of entertainment, and was gravely at risk of being bored stupid. Maybe I'm a philistine for denouncing such a high profile film in such a manner. Bottom line, though, is that if the film did do its job and offered a semi-decent thriller with polished acting and a more intriguing build-up, I would not be sitting in my chair in fits of laughter at how bad the film is.",The Village
630,StainGirlLives,"spooky, but less than the previous Shyamalans",7,5 January 2006,"The Village is the newest creation of M. Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs). It's about an isolated community, living in a small village, late 19th century, complete with long skirts, Shakespearian language and small ordinary houses and grazing cattle in the surrounding fields.At first sight a very peaceful town, but a dark secret is hidden behind this misleading surface. The inhabitants constantly live in fear of 'those we don't speak of'. The tiniest tip of the color red, scares the villagers to death. They do not dare to take one step into the woods, and not one of them would, or should take even one step over the well marked borders of The Village.The new movie of M. Night Shyamalan has all the well known ingredients: surprising turns, an atmosphere that gives you goosebumps and moments where you jump up from your seat. In my opinion, it's a very disturbing story. But there's one thing that I miss: a great climax. This movie never seems to get this highlight. Shyamalan's latest is in the style of The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but in these pictures the ending gets you by surprise, they leave you with your eyes and mouth wide open. The story gets to you piece by piece, sometimes surprising, scaring or horrifying. But it doesn't last. The ending of Shyamalan's other movies left you with some of the surprise, horror, or fear. The Village's ending does none of this.Still, it's a nice movie, as long as it lasts. You're curiosity gets tickled and you only get one piece of the puzzle at a time. If I tell you more, it will ruin the plot of the movie. All I can tell is that it contains a love story, a tale of dubious and clashing moralities.

The idea of the movie (once you've seen the end) is so unrealistic but interesting. It obviously could never happen, and being that it's not a star wars movie, it just doesn't quite work. I'm sure that someone else other than the blind girl would've wondered out of the woods eventually and realized that it was not the 19th century (other than the town council, or whatever they were called). One satisfying scene is seeing the one actor fall to his death in the woods. I do feel badly that he portrays a mentally handicapped individual in the movie, I just don't like him in real life (he was in ""The Jacket"". What the heck is his name?). Oh well, I'm sure I'll think of it later. Anyway, this movie is alright, but a bit disappointing. Oh yeah, It's Adrian Brody!!",The Village

We never find out what his ""color"" is, the way she sees him, but I can only imagine it is bright gold like his soul or a piercing green like his eyes. The other standout is Brody. Neither a villain nor a hero, we sympathize and demonize equally, he is a very tragic character.The usage of color, slow-motion, and music is amazing.

Night Shyalaman cannot write a decent screenplay to save his life? Even after Unbreakable I was making excuses for him, because you know, there's some pretty decent ideas amidst the rubbish and visually his storytelling is quite interesting...Enough. I don't think I am spoiling everyone when I said that The Village was absurd and laughably BAD. First the good (there's very little of it, though): the actress who plays the blind girl is wonderful and very expressive. The look of the movie is for the most part lovely. Not brilliant, occasionally corny and ridiculous, but good for the most part. Shyalaman is still good at scaring us half to death when he wants to. The music is quite pretty. But when you have a ridiculous plot, a screenplay that takes itself far too seriously and a director that appears to construct a whole movie based on his OMGSOCOOL cameo you end up wanting to throw things at the screen.Mind you, I had no problems with the pacing. Or with the lack of gore and blood and creepiness. And yes, I did get the Oh So Deep And Meaningful Metaphors Shyalaman so kindly spelled out for me a dozen times (how some people can call this ""subtlety"" I don't know, and will never understand, all I know is that the apparently intelligent political reading was far too obvious) - it was still complete crap, and all the more crappy because in other hands, it might have worked. Because the concept was not at all bad, even if it seems laughably bad after watching it. But people, if you want to see about people running from the evils and the scariness of the real world only to find it in their little idyllic community... well just rent Dogville already, don't watch this stupid thing, made by a man that not only has no sense of humor but fancies himself the most insightful film-maker in Hollywood. Please.In short? Some interesting images and a few good ideas completely ruined. Oh, and the plot twist that was apparently The Coolest and Most Surprising Thing Ever? I totally saw that one coming. And I have to say it's a pity to watch Shyalaman completely waste his talent as a director and his skill for suspense by making this sort of senseless rubbish that is nowhere as good as the stuff he could, and should be making.

Going to the theatre thinking you'll get a good, visceral scare is probably going to result in disappointment.

Night Shamalayanadahan's movies put together, including The Sixth Sense counted twice. Husband and I kept looking at each other and saying, ""This movie is so cool."" And when it was over, we watched *all* the bonus features, including a ten minute thing on, like, EDITING it or something. We haven't responded to a movie like this since... maybe _Sleepy Hollow_.It got *awful* reviews.I think that when the movie came out (I didn't notice, I had a new baby) there was a lot of hype surrounding the plot twists. Kind of like Sixth Sense, where there's this huge thing at the end. So people were too focused on that, and analyzed the whole movie through that filter. We were fortunate enough NOT to know that, or read any reviews, or hear any hype before watching it. Yah, there are twists. But who cares? If you haven't seen it, don't think about any of the media surrounding it, if you can. Just watch it, and don't anticipate anything while you watch. I know, that's impossible.I cannot express how much I liked this movie. It was... totally perfect. Every moment considered. Every line important, everything in every shot adding value, nothing wasted. A masterpiece.",The Village
637,lsnunez,"Taut, Suspenseful Thriller",9,31 July 2004,"I have to admit my first reaction was ""Why not burn down the woods?"". Still, this movie kept me entertained and riveted to the screen for the duration. There were several major plot twists that were unforeseen, and a few that were.Like most movies, there are plot holes, but if there weren't there wouldn't be a movie.The acting was excellent and the cinematography was unbelievable. Bryce Dallas Howard was excellent and convincing in her role, and Joaquin Phoenix was equally as well. Adrien Brody showed why he is an Oscar winning actor for his role as the village idiot.",The Village
638,JoeyMarie,Shocking? Or Not Too Shocking??,10,30 July 2004,"It's hard to comment on this movie. As is with every M. Night Shyamalan movie there is a secret, the Sixth Sense we were shocked out of our minds and in this I think many are torn on whether to be shocked again or laugh. The movie has many elements of surprise and the tension builds very dramatically, star performances by Bryce Dallas Howard & Joaquin Phoenix, but then teters on a very steep precicpice ... is the truth shocking? Or is it not? I guess this isn't the best review, bc without telling the secret I can't totally comment on it, it's personal preference. If you like twists that you never expected and have a good appreciation for those with very creative minds (like our writer's) then I feel you'll like the secret ... if you're more down to earth and can't fathom something totally out of the water even happening, I feel you won't like the secret. My one bit of advice is go in with an open mind and see the picture as a picture, then criticize it.",The Village
639,caseychief,Are you kidding me?,3,23 July 2005,"I'm so glad I didn't waste money seeing this in the theaters and waited until it came to satellite. I can't think of a much worse way to spend $7.50 then to see this silly little movie.First, let me say that I did enjoy the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs immensely. They all were moving, well done films that knew how to keep your suspense heightened. Suspenseful films are some of my favorite films to watch and Shyamalan is normally a master at it.The ""suspense"" in this film revolves around eerie creatures in woods outside a nineteenth century village. The people in the village fear the creatures but are safe as long as they don't venture out into the woods. Of course, you know some of the villagers, being naturally curious, will eventually wander out in the woods. So the creatures do some things to make sure the villagers don't do it again. Are there some hidden meanings and secrets involved with the creatures and the villagers? Of course there are...after all, it's a Shyamalan movie.But there is no reason for me to even discuss the ""secrets"" involved with the creatures, the village, or any other part of this movie, because they are just so unbelievably silly. Let's just say that some secrets are not worth $7.50 nor an hour and a half of your life to find out. The difference with the other 3 Shyamalan movies I mentioned above is that the secrets involved with them were at least somewhat believable and so did not ruin the stories.I really hope Shyamalan learns from this meager effort and puts a little more thought into his next movie.",The Village

For people like me I can say: go see it anyway! It is a very interesting movie that, yes, is scary at times, but not as much as I had thought initially. On top of that, it has so much more to give than an adrenaline kick! The movie surprised me in that it wasn't a classic psychological horror movie. It approaches 'Sixth Sense' well in its subtleness and it complexity. I liked the characters, especially Ivy and Lucius (great acting by all actors, especially the younger ones!) and was surprised by some comical elements. The camera work was very good and the weather seemed to follow the atmosphere of the movie. The colors were wonderful as well!Like all movies by M. Night Shyalaman, this one is about fear of the unknown. How does a society, how do people deal with fear? The odd (but positive) thing is that, where Ivy expects to find coldness and meanness, she finds kindness instead. The more I think about it, the better I like this movie. 8 stars out of 10!",The Village
641,sowbi,Promotion mistake,7,28 October 2004,"The major fault of The Village is not in the script, or acting, or direction. It is in the promotion. Because I do not want to reveal all all I'll say is that people should watch the movie without seeing its posters, taglines, trailers, or should disregard them completely.If you watch this film with an open mind, with no preconceived notions (on account of the director), I think you'll like it a lot.The actors are very good, but the directors' imprint is seen very clearly in the dialogue delivery as well as the expressions. The direction and cinematography are both good.Finally, everyone complains that this wasn't scary at all. I don't think that was the point of this film. It is one ofthose that make you think.

The answer is an emphatic YES. DESPITE the bad IMDB rating....I am shocked. The people who gave bad ratings/reviews apparently did not understand the message/point of the movie. Are you looking to be scared? Then NO this is not the movie for you-there are many tense moments, and many scenes that leave you asking ""why?""-HOWEVER M.

The performances by Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrien Brody are excellent-in fact-the entire cast is excellent-they make you feel and understand their characters and motivations despite the extreme time difference between our times and theirs.

643,less_than_roger,Excellent,9,29 August 2004,"i don't really know where to start with this film, i wanted to see it, but at the same time didn't. i wasn't really bothered either way, but as it happens went last night to see it, and i adored it. it had me laughing, crying, and biting my nails. the film itself is set funnily enough in a village. its about a small town of simple people, that just happen to have something evil living in the woods next to them. For me this film wasn't about the monsters, it was about the love, and emotion one person can have for another person. i can not go into to much detail about this film as i would not want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. yet what i will say is, go see it, even if you don't think you will like it give it the chance. its a fantastic film with a awesome cast. i only had a few complaints about the movie, many things were left unexplained, for example the beginning we are not told what happened. also a lot of things are left without a conclusion to them, this could be seen as either a good or bad thing. we are left to use our imaginations and decide for ourselves what comes of The Village.9 out of 10.",The Village
644,trevski2001,Well crafted period psychological drama,9,5 January 2008,"Like most people I thought 'Sixth Sense' was brilliant and went along to see 'Signs' partly on the strength of it. Was I disappointed - apart from the well documented plot shortcomings the film seemed to be shot as a 50's budget flick with none of the period charm. I left the cinema thinking 'what was the point of that?' Similarly I saw 'Unbreakable' on TV and found it to be very ordinary.'The Village' had it's premiere on BBC2 this evening. The synopsis in the Radio Times interested me but I was half expecting to be disappointed. I was actually pleasantly surprised.A group of people disaffected with city life set up an Amish-like village in a remote spot. To prevent the younger villagers straying, they invent a legend of monsters in the surrounding woods. Legend has it that, years ago, a truce was agreed whereby the villagers didn't stray into the woods or the monsters into the village. When one of their number is seriously injured, it is decided to break the truce and venture through the woods to the nearest town in order to get medical supplies.So, there aren't actually any monsters, but the film is shot from the perspective of villagers who think that they do exist, thus creating several very atmospheric and scary scenes.Some people have criticised the integrity of the plot but I think it holds together and could just about be believable. You could read between the lines and draw parallels with our leaders warnings about the 'axis of evil'.For me, this film is everything that 'Signs' wasn't - everything comes together to form a very memorable experience - cinematography, script, lighting, soundtrack, sets, acting and direction are all first class. I'm glad to say that I've been able to revise my personal opinion that MNS was a one-hit wonder.",The Village
645,boon23,Another piece of art,10,4 August 2004,"Now what did they expect from a movie made by M.Night Shyamalan? Something straight...no way. When I watched ""The Village"" I was ready for it, ready for this great director and his very special way of creating movies. When I first watched ""SIGNS"", i did not like it, because of my expectations. I expected something big, something outstanding and the entire movie was in such a small location. No spaceships, no ray-guns...and weird looking aliens. But somehow I realized that there was more to ""SIGNS"" than what disappointed by and when I watched it later on on DVD, it was a great movie with so much depth and feeling. It was ... intense. And that is exactly where I started getting ready for the village: I was expecting something intense and this was exactly what I got. A beautifully shot movie with very well developed and acted characters and a story, revealing and shocking. I will give no spoilers. When you enter ""The Village"" you should do exactly that. Enter it. Be a part of it to get to feel what the inhabitants feel. Then, I promise, you will see probably the best movie this year has to offer.",The Village

It is eerily haunting at the beginning and you have the niggling fear that you are in for an interesting experience.   Lo and behold, within about forty minutes you find it's all silliness and smoke. I can suspend my disbelief as well as the next guy but after being raised in the woods of Pennsylvania I defy anyone who is blind to run at full speed for more than two steps without running headfirst into a large birch tree. Yet we are supposed to accept that the blind heroine can not only accomplish this feat, but kill the ""monster"", and magically find her way back home again. Hogwash! Other than a ridiculous premise, mediocre character development and total unbelievability it was a waste of what could have been a truly wonderful movie in the horror genre. What a cop-out.

647,newtonooi,same features on a different story,6,21 August 2004,"I saw this movie expecting three things; first an unexpected twist at the end, which did happen.  Second, a love story between a man and a woman that ties in with the twist.  This also occurred, except this time the focus is more on the woman (Howard's character) than on the man (Phoenix's character), whereas in the previous 3 movies, the focus was on the man (Willis's characters in Sixth Sense and Unbreakable and Gibson's character in Signs).  Third, a brief cameo by the director, which did happen, though in a different style than in previous times.After seeing the Village, I know discern a fourth feature common to all 4 movies; one of the main characters has an extraordinary ability which he/she does not fully appreciate at first, but later comes to use with great responsibility.  This was the boy's sixth sense in the first movie, the security guard's unbreakable body in the second movie, the daughter's appreciation of water in Signs, and the blind girl's ability to ""see"" several steps ahead in this movie.  Various other devices were stolen from the previous three movies for use in this one.  These include the masked villian which few discern until it is too late (like Jackson's character in Unbreakable), the artificial villian (the ghosts in Sixth Sense), and the various characters who are widowed, orphaned, or have suffered the premature or even violent loss of a loved one (Gibson's widowed character in Signs).  These various devices appear as major plot events in the Village, though in a form that is hidden until the story has finished.  In all, the scares weren't as scary, the plot twist was not as sudden, the dialogue a bit artificial, the villian was really not evil, just an ""idiot"", and the music not as captivating.  A good effort, but not as good as the previous movies.",The Village
648,knightblade2001,"Horror movie on the 'resting rock', with a real twist",10,20 August 2004,"I do apologize for the title.  I will not give up anything and there is a small place in the movie called the resting rock, i will not lie. However, I will not give away spoilers.  M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village""  is about a quaint, peaceful, tranquil, and boring little village in the middle of a clearing surrounded by forestry. The little village is not quiet though. People are living in fear. fear of something they have never seen, to an extent, something that has never attacked them, something they do not speak of.  They have three real rules in the town.  Don't let the color 'red' be seen. Don't go into the woods, and when you hear the warning bell, run like hell.  Thats all well and good.  But as you watch the movie, you begin to see the ultimate twists and turns that Shyamalan is known for.  The acting is very good, each person seemed to feel their role as simple 19th century villagers.   The village itself is very authentic looking.  The borders to the village (wooden flag polls) that line what seems to be a mile wide little town. everything down to the lock on the 'quiet room' door is that of the turn of the century. Shyamalan did another excellent job keeping the scenery authentic.  Since all of his other movies were set in the late nineties and the early millenium this must have been an interesting change for him.  He took that curve very well I must say. Overall, this is a hard review to write since saying anything that happened in the movie would give away a shock, I must advise you go see this one yourself.  If you have a date, he/she may jump into your arms. It does shock both sexes. I saw people of all ages in the audience jumping and gasping at certain scenes.  Heck even I jumped, and I do not do that very often.  So I hope you'll who do watch it, enjoy it! -knightblade",The Village
649,crossing_lethe,An OK Film Afflicted by Bad Marketing - Slight Spoilers,7,7 August 2005,"""The Village"" is a perfect example of why it's dangerous to mis-market a movie. While being handled like a thriller, the audience would have been much better informed about what it actually is if it were handled more as a human interest piece. ""The Village"" becomes much more interesting when watching it as a character study than a horror/suspense movie.Changing focus on a movie can only take you so far, though. There's still the matter of the plot - does it work? The answer is yes and no. It works when you consider the movie a warning against being ruled by fear - I once heard that M. Night Shyamalan (henceforth MNS) had post 9/11 America in mind when writing the film. In that light, one sees the villagers purposely using fear as a control mechanism and the movie becomes a fairly clever commentary on our times. It doesn't work when you question the plot to much. It's not easy to try to make sense of the choices and actions of the Elders. Superficial answers are all one can get. The final confrontation with a ""creature"" at the end doesn't quite work out as well as it should. For a movie that works best on a psychological level, the action involved seems misplaced. I tend to see it as a built in bathroom break and usually don't watch it through.The actor's portrayals of their characters are hit and miss. I don't know if it was a purposeful choice of MNS, but portrayal of the Elders don't ring as true as the younger generation. Given the final twists of the movie, maybe the Elders were meant to sound rather clunky with their speech. Regardless, the work of the older generation (with a special mention of William Hurt) largely comes off as rather wooden and uncomfortable. The acting improves greatly with the younger stars. It is mostly the work of the perfectly cast Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix that make the movie bearable at all, although smaller roles such as Judy Greer's and Michael Pitt's definitely add to the film. In my experience, it's general consensus that Bryce and Joaquin's scenes together that are the best in the film.Overall, I think MNS's greatest achievement in this movie is in creating atmosphere and a visually appealing directing style. I think it's time he starts working on scripts with other people - he needs someone to tell him when something doesn't work.",The Village

652,dg3-1,Forget the twist; this movie holds its own regardless,9,12 January 2005,"I won't comment on the predictability of the twist in the end, for that has been done to death. The problem many people have with this movie is that they always expect a knock-your-socks-off twist from M. Night to the exclusion of being able to appreciate anything else about his films. This film holds its own, both because of and in spite of the twist at the end.Ultimately, this is not a horror film, mildly a suspense film, but mostly a drama about the extent to which people will go to protect those they love from the world outside and how, ultimately, such protection is hopeless and life must be lived. That is a message each of us grapples with whether explicitly or implicitly, and one that's brought to beautiful life by Shyamalan.Other comments: perfect cinematography, as usual, by Roger Deakins. Bryce Dallas Howard will be big--her performance here was really the only one that stood out in what was mostly a wasted cast (for example, Michael Pitt, who did a great job as the lead in ""The Dreamers,"" has one or two lines in the whole movie, and Sigourney Weaver...well, she's just left out to dry). Because of those flaws, I'm giving this movie a 9/10, but its message is so pure and well-meaning that even without the twist it made me smile.",The Village

And I am not a movie expert by any means, but I'm wondering if the seven to eight elders who created this village and were the keepers of the secret of the woods,where did all the other families come from and do we think all those parents were in on the hoax also? And if the elders created this village what looks like 15 - 20 years ago, how can the village be so populated with all ages of people that believe in the creatures? It appeared that EVERYONE believed in the creatures. They couldn't have all been born there. Seems thin to me.

654,Cpartak,"See this film, and draw your own conclusions",8,11 March 2005,"I want to start of by saying that I've never had a more difficult time of rating a film than I did for ""The Village"". The reason for this being that it's not simply a movie which you love or hate, it's one that you think about after you're done watching it. Perhaps this wasn't the case for everyone who saw it, but it certainly was the case for me. I went into the theatre with certain expectations knowing that this was an M. Night Shyamalan film. After his three previous films you come to expect a certain essence that you wouldn't find in any other director's work. Shyamalan's films have their own style, look, and to a certain extent their own feel. I personally could not mistake any of his films for those of another director. With that having been said, ""The Village"" doesn't disappoint as far as acting and especially cinematography are concerned. As with his previous films, Shyamalan does a great job of extracting superb performances from his cast. This is especially true for Bryce Dallas Howard who delivers a first-rate performance as a blind girl who has the ability to see perhaps more than those without her affliction. Adrien Brody is also very good as the village idiot (no pun intended) who has more below the surface than meets the eye. As I mentioned earlier, the cinematography and camera work in this film are excellent as well. The views of the village, especially at night, are perfect for setting the dark and sinister tone of the film. Shyamalan also does a great job of setting up the film's frightening moments by carefully and gradually bringing the audience in with his superb use of the camera lens. We're not scared of what's on the screen, we're scared of what what might be lurking behind it. This is one of the reasons that I enjoy Shyamalan's films, he never goes for the cheap thrill and instead chooses to create an atmosphere that will keep the audience guessing until the very end. The final thing that I want to touch on regarding this film is of course the screenplay. It's difficult for me to label it simply as good or bad. I feel that it goes beyond those simple definitions. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that Shyamalan is an extremely talented director and writer, and more importantly an absolute original. However, with ""The Village"" I feel that he wanted to express his opinion and at the same time send a message about today's society and the fear that people live in. It is this message that I feel may be the one downfall of this film. I believe that many people didn't get it, while others who did simply didn't agree with it. And there are of course those that didn't want to watch a film with a message and simply wanted to be entertained. Either way I think that the one thing all those people had in common is that they talked about the film after it was over, just as I'm talking about it now. (I strongly doubt that ""Freddy Got Fingered"" received 23,000 votes on this website). The point here is that ""The Village"" is the type of film that makes you think and want to talk to someone who's also seen it. I recommend it to anybody who enjoys films that are beyond the norm, but my advice is to watch it without any preconceived notions which can be established by reading reviews, including this one.",The Village

This is a film that people just did not get right at the moment of release, and it is quite unfair to say that things started to go down hill for Shyamalan from this point onwards. It still had that beautiful dramatic complexion that all his previous films had, especially SIGNS whereby you weren't sure what exactly was going on. I'm just saying that I love this film. The cinematography is immaculate, JNH's score is as breathtaking as it ever can be. The dialog is very unique and noteworthy. I can't really see why people are so ticked off with the ending. It's a fair ending. It makes sense, it's totally bizarre in the sense of 'wow' 'WTH' or 'unexpected', because that's the kind of ending people enjoy. I'm just glad that this film managed to get a cult following even after all these years, because it really is a misunderstood film.",The Village
656,herbandpatti,Diet deficiency?,8,15 January 2006,"People either love or hate movies by M. Night Shymalan. Herb and I loved The Village. I had read two Associated Press reviews, in the local paper and in the St. Louis paper. One hated it and the other gave it four stars out of four. Gene Shalit and Roger Ebert hated it. Richard Roper loved it. It seems there is no middle ground.It is difficult to try to explain The Village without giving away the famous ""Shymalan Twist"" at the end. A tiny community of people lives serenely in a secluded valley, far away from the violence of ""the towns."" Creatures known only as ""those we don't speak of"" exist in the forbidden woods nearby. Villagers placate the creatures with ritual offerings of meat, and keep watch just in case of attack.Joaquin Phoenix has a leading role as Lucius Hunt, but Bryce Dallas Howard is the real star of this movie. It is hard to believe that her role as blind Ivy Walker is a debut performance. Oscar winner Adrien Brody has a pivotal role, and Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt also star. Of course, Night has a speaking role in the movie, as always, but you won't see him until near the end, and then really only the back of his head.The lack of ""the bad color"" in the daily life of the villagers lends almost a sepia-tone feel to the film, although they use plenty of golds, light blues and greens. I wondered on the ride home if the illnesses that killed a child and caused Ivy's blindness could be due to a dietary deficiency. After all, they have no tomatoes, cherries, strawberries, or any other red foods.I feel that the film raised issues about the lengths to which people will go for protection. Who hasn't daydreamed about a peaceful existence in lush countryside, far away from the noise, dirt and violence of the cities we really live in?

The only character that were explored were surrounded with lazy disabilities to mask a lack of development. Bryce Dallas Howard did her best as the blind Ivy Walker to stay in character, despite being asked at points in the film to run in a race and, how do I say this without a spoiler... lets just say you can Imagine Blair Witch if it were one person, and they were blind and you get my drift. Did I mention she was blind? William Hurt's pauses would have make Shatner blush, but perhaps he was simply in shock at how bad the writing was and how little his, or anyone else in the movie was explored. But I guess it would have to be that way, since if you thought about any of them for more that a few seconds about it, the whole movie falls apart. I would say I expect better from M. Night, but really should we? After sixth sense he's demonstrated the ability to stretch 20 minutes of weak ""what if"" into 2 hours of boredom inter cut with cheap ""made you jump"" scenes. It's not a down movie for him, he's just found his level.",The Village
661,Shawzil,It was slow and painful yet intriguing if you have not seen any trailers prior to the movie. Smash ending if you pay attention!,8,2 September 2004,"I just got back from the movie and I thought it was very very original and a break from the same material out there these days. True that the movie could have been better (thats an opinion everyone has on allot of movies) in some areas but over all if you pay attention instead of yapping with your friends about this and that through out the film, try to predict the next step and you would have enjoyed being right if you got it!I agree that the actors were too good to had performed in the caliber that they had however that is what the script and the director/writer demands they perform.***** SPOILERS AHEAD ***** I have read what loads of other users have wrote and can't help but say this.... I feel that many of them have missed mentioning the great things at the end that redeem the whole boring/slow portions of the film.First of all, the group of elders in the film were nothing more than a bunch of ordinary people (MAYBE) wealthy enough and have been hurt by the crime found in the modern world they lived in. They had bought the reserve space they chose to create a new life and world for themselves and their children and they managed to find each other to pull this sort of idea when they met each other at a group therapy sessions & thats how it all started.The Creatures they created and the whole fiascal they designed was just the simplest they could bring up way from keeping the children and the younger generations from crossing beyond the VILLAGE to discover the outside world....The reserve security personel were owned by WALKER FOR GODS SAKE! Has no one noticed that? Why am I reading other people's remarks that have not put any effort into analyzing the movie any deeper than their skin?All in all a very good movie and I would rate it 8/10. Good stuff and much better than Signs!Shawzil",The Village
662,jengod-2,This movie is not a horror movie,7,13 February 2005,"This movie is not a horror movie--it's an allegory about control versus liberty and innocence versus amorality. It's closer to *The Truman Show* than it is to any horror movie. New Urbanism, indeed. At first I thought the death of Noah at Ivy's hand was some kind of justice, but I eventually saw that it was in fact the death of an innocent, not at the hand of particular criminal, but as a consequence of the corruption innate in the premise of the Village. William Hurt's character's fundamental deviousness and duplicity is demonstrated in his choice to send the blind girl out to see the real world--she was the only who got leave and return without being immediately transformed. I wish this movie had a part two and three, because I have no doubt that a slow revelation of the truth is at hand. The story of the Village is incomplete, and that's what was frustrating to me, not the infamously unsatisfying reveal at the end. A fascinating cautionary tale.",The Village
663,bawko,"Amazingly Underrated - Makes other movies look ""Primitive"" :)",10,1 February 2005,"Greetings!Shyamalan has outdone himself on this one - for an unexpected reason. Sure, it has the trademark Shyamalan ""twist"" ending, but even without that aspect of the movie, something very special was created when ""The Village"" was filmed.If I were to recommend that anyone watch this film in any particular way, I would suggest that they completely forget about the director and his penchant for surprise endings and other filming gimmicks, and instead focus on the characters, dialog, and society being portrayed in The Village. Doing so might prove to be very interesting and possibly quite thought provoking.Several stereotypes are assumed by the viewer when they see the setting of the film - due to the 1890's setting and how we view the era in our modern time. However, watch closely and listen to what the people actually say - and how they interact with each other. You will suddenly realize that the preconceived stereotypes of the 1800's you might have are hollow, and that this is a distinctly different society from our modern notions of frontier American life. Many of the social interactions and ways of speaking with each other, as well as non-religious overtones of the society being portrayed wind up being distinctly ""out of place"" with the period and intriguingly interesting to view. Within the first 20 or 30 minutes, you know that this is a separatist group that is distinctly different from the rest of 1800's civilization, as the differences and anomalies begin to pile up. Absolutely fascinating.I feel that this movie is Shyamalan's finest work, with far more depth than any of his previous films (yes - even The Sixth Sense...). The astonishing way in which he has made the village ""come to life"" and take on a coherent yet unusual social ""flavor"" is nothing short of utter brilliance... my bowler hat off to Mr. Shyamalan.Best wishes, Bawko",The Village
664,vhmascitti,Village idiots,1,12 August 2004,"FOLLOWING COMMENTS CONTAIN SPOILERS...I THINK! Okay, you can't really spoil this movie because the ending is telegraphed from the start when the cameras pan the landscape and show a reasonably modern tower that's in stark contrast to the rest of the set. When I saw it at first, I really thought the director/camera guys had made a mistake by including it in the shot. But then it showed up again and again. (I must confess, I visited this movie set right after the filming and was certain that tower was for use in filming, not in the movie! When I saw it in the first shot, I was amazed at how dumb it was.) To all other appearances, the villagers of The Village look like they're from the 19th century, they talk very much like they're from the 19th century, but because everything is soooooo very 19th century, it becomes very apparent, very early on that this ain't no 19th century village. It's just been set up to look like one for purposes of the Village ""elders"" -- a group of very self righteous, very sure of themselves Amish-like folk who try to explain away the scalping of village animals and the partial painting of village doors by claiming it must have been a very big coyote. Yes, a coyote with a knife and a bucket of red paint. Even 19th century villagers aren't that stupid. The folks who made this movie must be basing the intelligence of the average American viewer on the intelligence of its current leaders, but to say this film is an insult doesn't quite explain why the writer/producers/director feel like they have to lay the whole thing out so plainly and so early on. The isolation of the Village always feels self serving, always contrived. Monsters in red cloaks? Eerie sounds emanating from the woods. And paranoia about the color red? Nothing in this movie makes sense either literally or metaphorically. In the end, it's just a silly love story with lots of scary music to make you nervous. The only violence is the stabbing by one villager (whose scary behavior is to shut up for most of the movie) by another (whose scary behavior is to giggle, dance and drool -- before becoming a homicidal maniac, of course.) The only really evil character (the real village idiot) falls into a hole and dies. The purported evil beings of the forest who terrorize and seem to imprison the villagers are cartoon characters when you see them about half way through the film. Just like the aliens in the ""Signs"" these are poorly conceived, almost stereotypical villains that make this a C, not even a B, movie. In the end, the resolution isn't really a resolution at all. Just verification of what you figured out in the movie's first few scenes. The scariest thing about this film is that there are people out there who actually thought this was a thriller and was any good.",The Village
665,dgthompson,HUGE LETDOWN,6,7 August 2004,"Not giving anything away here, so don't be scared to read if you haven't seen the movie.  I am a huge M Night Shymalan fan... Sixth sense was awesome, Signs scared the pants off me, Unbreakable was decent... I was so looking forward to seeing the Village - the interviews I saw, publicity, all indicated another great haunting movie.BLAH!I've never been in a movie theater where the whole theater walked out at the end all talking about how bad and stupid a movie was.  First i was shocked that the theater was only about a 1/4 full on a Friday evening in it's 2nd week of release (film must be dying quickly).  M Night promised this whole suspenseful, scary, plot twisting thing... right up to the end I was waiting for something to twist and it sucked.  The plotline is something a 9 year old could write up in school.   I guessed the whole plotline about 15 minutes into the movie and the whole time I was saying, boy am I going to be surprised/shocked when I see what the real plotline is.  The plot has like 2 incredibly small plot twists.... I think Tom and Jerry cartoons have bigger plot twists.  A ton of great actors/actresses in this movie who all acted very well.  It was visually beautiful.  Everything was fine but the actual story which was HORRIBLE.I love his movies and this was a MAJOR disappointment to me.",The Village
666,lauriesavage8,Superb Film,10,1 June 2006,"This is one of my favourite films of all time because the storyline is completely original, in fact I had never heard of anything like it before. Joaquin Phoenix made the film come alive, he is a sensational actor and was fantastic in this movie. The interaction between the characters and the innocent way in which they all spoke to each other was very endearing. Some parts of this film were scary even though it isn't meant to be a horror film, so watch out for jumpy bits. Overall I'd say this film is a voyage of discovery and an unconventional love story thrown in! The reason that I enjoyed this movie so much was because as the film got further and further in Joaquin got more and more good looking,haha so it's definitely a film for the ladies. By the way if you didn't like this film and would like to see it ripped apart I suggest you watch Scary Movie 4 as they really do make fun of it to the absolute maximum.",The Village

One that according to advertising and publicity would scare and inspire. It did neither for me. Don't get me wrong, I loved the concept but felt that it was poorly delivered. To me, this movie sent the message to hide from your fears, to run and to lie. The so-called victims in this movie turn out to be nothing but a group of scared individuals who run from their lives because they can't deal with society. Not a real scary twist of events. Overall, the acting was terrific, very good performances and the shooting locations were beautiful. Just not a mind blowing plot and I felt that it had sent out a poor message.",The Village
668,amamistyed,A work of art from beginning to end,10,23 July 2006,"I have been so surprised at the negative comments and reviews for this movie. I think it is because it is a movie based on dialog and relationships with quiet and deep felt emotion rather than explosive acting...I don't know. But for me it is a masterpiece by a genius. The acting is superb by each member of a wonderful and obviously close cast. The mystical, moving music alone could cause me to watch it over and over. Many people comment on ""camera angles being good."" Misses the mark a bit. Every single frame of this movie COULD be framed...even the shot of Noah dead at the bottom of the pit. The enormous care that goes into the details of every scene of this and all of Shyamalan's movies is a gift to the movie goer.Night's attention to individual characters is a wonderful change from the superficiality of most movies. The gentleness, honesty, humor and beauty of each personality is delightful. You get to know these people...they have quirks and fears and desires...and he causes you to care deeply about them. Mercy inhabits all of his films...and tolerance and understanding. He is able to take the most simple things and create depth and breadth and make each moment of a film memorable for some small reason or another. I don't think anyone has made a more beautiful love scene than the one of Brice and Joaquine sitting on the porch as he expresses his love for her.The thing about this film, and I believe all of Shyamalan's films. is that you have to let yourself FEEL them. You have to slow down a bit and enter into the world he has created and become part of it for a while. But, then, isn't that why we watch movies? He gives us real people, able to be heroic with almost no one ever knowing...he give hope for the human condition...he brings beauty for the eyes and ears and uniqueness at every turn. The Village for me was like a master's painting and I believe all of this particular master's paintings will become classics.",The Village
669,mljohns,Disappointing to say the least....,1,4 August 2004,"I, like most other people, went into The Village expecting a great movie with a stunning twist.  Not quite.  The most drags along and doesn't make the audience really care about the villagers.  I understand that Night was trying to make it as suspenseful as possible, but ultimately he failed. There was nothing even mildly scary about this film.  By the time the plot twist is revealed, the relatively little suspense I did feel just faded away. At the end of it all, (SPOILER) I just felt that William Hurt was just playing a rich guy that had too much money and a desire to run from his problems.  This could have been a better movie and it just marks a slowly, steady progression into mediocrity for M. Night Shamalan.

Anyways this movie was sort of similar to that only really bad. This guy is a much better director than a writer. The ending is so obvious so as to not be obvious. In other words you'll be like ""aha"" like 30 minutes in, and then realize that that would be way too stupid for a movie this long, and then you realize that you were right, and then the movie ends 30 minutes later. If you're going to watch it, only watch the first 30 minutes, they're pretty good and you don't need to see how it ends. Really, some good performances, good camera-work, story is crap. I really expected a lot out of it, but it was very bad.",The Village

If you can't be bothered to invest the time and thought in exploring an ""issue"" movie then please don't go to see this one. Especially if you have the tendency to then come onto the IMDB and moan about ""how bad it is"" when really it just wasn't the film type you get off on. This film is far from perfect but it deserves to be judged on what it is, not on what its viewer ""unreasonably"" expected it to be.The Village explores issues related to the fabric of the society we find ourselves in. Just what are the essentials needed to keep us happy and safe? Has society become too decadent and sick to offer any reasonable chance of delivering them?The Elders come up with their own unique and radical solution!That ""solution"" is the crux of the film. After experiencing their lifestyle in the earlier part of the film, at film end you find yourself wondering to what extent the Elders are justified in what they have done.M.

There are a lot of complaints about this movie, but I think that maybe that is due to people's expectations being different from the actual product. I went in genuinely hoping for a monster movie, but was happy with what it turned out to be, despite the disappointment. Once the hype dies down I feel that people will recognize this film for what it is; a well made and entertaining film that suffered from over hyping and the ire of over demanding fanboys. Some may see this as a low point in M. Night's filmography, and it may well be, however if this is his worst film it still stands far and away above the majority of the Hollywood tripe we are spoon-fed these days.

Suspenseful at times and hair raising at others The Village left me feeling just fine about the 20 bucks spent at the theater and that is something that seems to happen less and less often these days.Joaquim Phoenix and Adrian Brody were both very good in their roles as was Ms. Howard but the star of this film is Shyamalan's fantastic ability to tell a story on the big screen.

Though the script might not hold the strong captivation of the sixth sense, it does a pretty good job, especially during the build up to climax. i don't want to say more about the film as it will give away the story, but please remember, this is not just a "" horror flick"" ( thought it has some seat jumping moments ), it has much more deeper meaning which you will realize after the movie. mesmerising violin solo's performed by hilary hahn add to the beauty of the film. DO NOT let the reviews misguide you! i walked into the theater ready to be disappointed, but came out with a much rewarding experience. though the cinematography was good in this movie, it wasn't as good as tak's takes ( tak fujimoto was night's cinematographer for his previous films ). well, my money was definitely well spent and i am planning to watch it again when it comes out on DVD",The Village

Well, if you are in the mood for The Fast and the Furious, then go see the Rock's most recent movie. I love Shyamalan's films because he has a complete disregard for what the viewer is expecting to see - scratch that, he KNOWS what the viewer wants to see, and uses that to surprise them. What makes him the master of screen writing is that, unlike any other writer/director I've ever known, he hides the red herrings of the story, so that the most intelligent viewer will think he's caught on to something, when in fact he's falling into the trap. If you like brilliant film-making, then see this movie at least twice. I know that the best viewing for me was the third time, because only then did I truly appreciate all the effort that Night put into this film, even more than he did in The Sixth Sense, already a classic film. On top of the surprises, he adds themes of romance and deep grief that only a great director like him would be able to communicate in such a moving way. These elements portrayed by such great actors as Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver, and William Hurt, and most of all the amazing new Bryce Dallas Howard, lead me to give this film a 10 out of 10.

I went in to this movie thinking that the commercials and trailers told me the big twist but thought that my guess was too obvious but sadly I was right. I'm not going to ruin this for anyone who hasn't seen it and thinks they may be surprised although I'm not sure preschoolers frequent IMDb to begin with. M Shamylan's movies has gotten progressivley worse as they've come, Sixth Sense was horribly predictable but the acting was good, UnBreakable was UnBearable and Signs was one of the worst movies I'd ever seen. The Village doesn't sink quite as low as Signs but that is damning with faint praise to say the least. Like Sixth Sense the story is predictable but the acting isn't nearly as good, Phoenix, Hurt and most of the rest chomp through their lines as if they had gone to the William Shatner school of hyperbole. Bryce Howard is tolerable as Hurt's daughter, she's good but at times not believable as someone who is blind and Adrien Brody is good as the village idiot.

Was a big fan of The Sixth Sense, and thought this film is a horror movie. Didn't like Signs much, found Unbreakable an average movie. But the trailer of The Village got me interested. Believe me friends, The Village isn't what you are expecting it to be.If you are going to watch this movie thinking its a horror movie, don't bother. The first 20 minutes have too many characters and is boring, but after that there is a nice setting up of story. The village is based on a 1900's era. The villagers in the film have a pact with creatures in the woods that they would respect each others boundary and won't harm each other till they cross it. Red colour is the bad colour which is not supposed to be taken inside the village as it attracts the creature. I would say both Joaquin Phoenix and Ivy Walker have acted brilliantly in their respective roles. They are in love, and Joaquin gets injured by a person who loves Ivy. Ivy has been shown as a blind girl. Now she must go to the Town through the woods to bring medicine for Joaquin.As all MNS movies there are a few brilliant twists before Ivy is supposed to go to The town, while in the woods and after she reaches the town. I would say it is a well made movie. And a very under-rated suspense movie.",The Village

But with this film there are times when the film feels like it has come to a standstill, But in your mind you are saying to yourself, 'That's OK the good bit is coming up soon, and it'll make it worthwhile watching the film'.

681,StevenPlaymountain,A moving love story starring the incredible Bryce Dallas Howard,10,23 January 2005,"First of all, let me tel you I'm a believer when it comes to 'the Shyamalan-concept', a mix of weird, surreal, almost illogical plot elements, shown in such a way that the viewer is constantly mislead. Only by the end of the film, the viewer experiences some sort of 'katharsis', by means of a spectacular surprising plot twist. Within a few minutes, a secret story-element is revealed, and the viewer sees the story he has just witnessed in a whole new (logical) light. This trademark of M. Night Shyamalan made me view his masterpieces ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" (which strangely has got a lot of negative reviews) over and over again.The main question is now, how does ""the Village"" incorporate this specific concept, and how well does it work in the movie? When I first had seen the movie, I couldn't help but feel that Shyamalan was 'reluctantly' giving the critics and the audience what it craved for, namely a huge, surprising plot element which would blow the viewers away at the end of the movie. Why reluctantly? Because, to my humble opinion, the 'Shyamalan-concept' is totally superfluous within the story of ""The Village"". And this story is, above all, a love story. It's about two young people in an isolated, gloomy, 19th century village trying to connect emotionally and spiritually with each other.Shyamalan did not deliver what I expected. He delivered far beyond my expectations. Instead of rattling off the same old thriller he's famous for, he comes up with a moving, picturesque film backed up by an incredible cast. Surprisingly imposing is débutante Bryce Dallas Howard (the charming daughter of director Ron Howard) who plays Ivy. She easily holds ground among all those great actors (Joaquin Phoenix, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Adrien Brody). The charming serenity and honesty by which she portrays her character Ivy, reveals a great talent. Every single scene she's in stunned me. The DVD even got an extra feature called 'Bryce's diary', and even there she left me in awe. She's a really, really promising actress, I can't stress that enough. Her performance is simply radiant and carries the whole movie. And herein lies the strength of ""The Village"": a simple, touching love story, performed in an inspired manner by a wonderful group of actors. And the 'Shyamalan-concept'? It's there, but there's plenty more to look for in ""The Village"".",The Village
682,despaina,"A Moving, Suspenseful Film",9,6 June 2011,"I really don't understand why this movie got such mixed reviews. Upon watching again recently, I am still intrigued by it in many ways. The dialogue matches the tone that these characters would create in their conceived society- that of respect and honesty. The backstories of the ""grandmasters"" of the society is compelling and moving. I do not feel creating such a society from their traumatic experiences was outlandish at all.As for the ending twist, I think Shyamalan did a superb job. For one, I felt it was believable. This, for me, made it all the more intriguing. I'm not sure what audiences or critics were expecting or wanting instead. A sci-fi, improbable ending? Or were audiences disappointed because the ending wasn't scary enough or the explanation was too simple and logical?In the end, it's unfortunate that films such as this end up being underrated. Why is it that a director's follow-up film has to go above and beyond the previous hit, in this case, ""The Sixth Sense""? And if it doesn't, the director has somehow let us down and hasn't done his/her job? The film should be strictly critiqued on it's own merits, and this film for one, was greatly misjudged.",The Village

But by chance this year my senior English class was on the topic of Utopian societies. We had read Handmaid's Tale over the summer and were apart to read Anthem. Before and while reading Anthem we watched the Village. As we progressed through this unit the similarities between the book Anthem and the Village were very obvious almost as if the script were taken right from the book. With some obvious changes and differences, the books theme is still a main theme in the movieRealizing before seeing the movie that it wasn't meant for cheap thrills and scares, but was to depict a Utopian society on the verge of destruction at the hand of a curious man and courageous woman allowed me to see this movie for what it was intended to be.

684,carlphillips1,A good idea ruined... but still worth it.,6,30 April 2005,"In a socially uniform village in the middle of the woods, terrifying creatures dwell inches from its borders. When the story begins you are met with a series of secrets that you are unable to decode. Mixed with some effectively frightening scenes and the general feeling of mystery, the film is enjoyably suspenseful.However, as most of Shyamalan's movies are, the story's first half is well done, but worsens as it progresses. Part of the Village's secret is revealed quite prematurely, allowing the viewer to expect the coming events, no matter how much they seem to contradict. Some things that still allowed the film to be enjoyable was the atmospheric music and the vividly natural forest setting.What prevented the story from coming to a dull halt was the suspense of what will become of Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blind young woman who is given permission to venture through the woods to get medicine for Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), her boyfriend. He had been stabbed by Noah Percy (Adrian Brody), an insane man, who was also in love with Ivy. Some of the questions that need to be asked are ""Why does Noah break out in laughter whenever the roars of the creatures are heard in the woods?"" and ""Why is Ivy allowed to venture through the woods, but nobody else?"" Besides being moderately thrilling and somewhat enchanting, the story also lays heavy on the aspects of unusual human behavior. Even with all of the movie's flaws, you may leave the theater thinking... ""Would I have done the same thing?""",The Village
685,uclaxlhuang,Failing to understand the depth of this movie,9,9 May 2005,"This movie has been significantly underrated because that the majority of the early critics have been failing to understand the philosophical depth. This movie uses an analogy to subtly challenge the logic, sanity and reality of predominating beliefs, if not only religious beliefs.The meetings of a group of authority figures resemble the form of church rulings. The personal tragic stories of a group of people have been exaggerated to impose a general religious-like beliefs, which resembles the witness in church phenomena. The turmoil of the ruling resembles the failing of such illogic predominating beliefs. The manipulation of the authorities indicates the reluctance of evidence-examining process for religious beliefs. The movie also show that good-wills combined with irrational interpretations could result in dysfunctional social behaviors.The director has handled the movie with all above elements and express it through conversations and actions and twists.Audiences should not approach this movie as a thrilling movie, if one does not feel or reflect on the thrills of such social unrest and religious insanity.",The Village

688,physman,Another fine suspense movie from Shyamalan,8,17 July 2006,"The powerful human element in The Village makes this so much more than a good Twilight Zone episode. Shyamalan and his terrific cast make you care about the residents of the village -- not just their fear of the menace surrounding them, but also the tragedies, heartache, and joys they experience in their everyday lives. Especially compelling are the younger generation of villagers, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, and Adrien Brody. (The village ""elders"", led by William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver, are a little less developed.) Add these powerful characters to the expected Shyamalan elements -- intriguing plot twists (plural), gripping cinematography, and a haunting musical score -- and you have another hit by the best maker of suspense films working today.",The Village
689,Shadowgirl78,Worst ever,1,27 March 2006,"This was the worst ""horror"" movie ever! It was completely disorganized, no structure at all! There was no plot to speak of, it seemed like it was just focusing on the kids and not at all what they were afraid of.Really, there was no surprises on this movie, it was simply awful to watch. The lead girl was the only substance in the film, she was a round character, not static like the rest. It was so obvious even from the beginning who did this and that..I geared up for a nice thrill and I got a lukewarm so called 'horror' movie that made pretty much no sense whatsoever. It is a horrendous movie with little to no horror in it at all.",The Village
690,Was_Here,"Great movie, but not all the way.",8,24 August 2005,"The Village is a very well-written, well-casted, and well-produced movie. Phoenix is always good, and this man has only one scar on his CV. Ladder49, a extremely boring movie, which should've been 30 min shorter than it is. The sixth sense is very very spooky, and Signs could be a kind of War of the Worlds clone. Which is good! Phoenix is also here good. And he's really nasty in Gladiator. And he's also good in this movie, although he does not have the main role. The trailers and commercials for this film, made the viewer to believe that he did. But it's no big deal, because Bryce Dallas Howard does a stunning job as Ivy Walker. The film is scary, and has a lot of moments where you sit and hug your pal in the seat next to you. The creatures in this movie is more scary than the Aliens in ""Alien"" The only thing that is to complain about, is the ending. Which is so extremely stupid. It seems like M. Night Shyamalan had to write the finish in a hurry, because it's not very thoughtfull, and does not fit the rest of the movie.But when everything comes everything it's a great movie, which should be in every DVD-collection!",The Village

I don't understand why this movie is looked down at. This movie is grossly underrated. My opinion may have been effected by the fact that I didn't have any expectations what so ever regarding this film, but even so. I loved this thrilling movie. This movie is unpredictable, and that is something you can't see to often if you ask me. The colors in this movie is nothing less than stunning, Mr. shyamalan really knows how to use colors, as seen in the sixth sense and unbreakable. There is nothing to say on the acting part either. Phoenix, Howard, and Hurt play all as brilliant as the next.",The Village

And young Miss Howard will be a BIG star; a demanding role, excellently performed.I've read all the comments here (so far) and no one has focused on this issue: How, pray tell, could a blind girl make a solo trek through the forest all alone? How could she tell what direction she was going at ANY time? Oh, once she found the road I could believe she could stay on it -- but how in the world could she have found the road? What did I miss? Notwithstanding that impossible ""suspension of disbelief"" moment I thought The Village was an excellent film (and a worthwhile rental).",The Village
693,Bradford,"Wonderful acting, asinine story.",4,3 September 2004,"The acting in this film is the only thing that makes it tolerable. William Hurt delivers one of his most compelling performances, even when hobbled with such stilted, cumbersome lines. Bryce Dallas Howard is nothing less than remarkable, a true discovery. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent, as well.Adrian Brody, however, ought to return his Oscar.M. Night Shyamalan's writing is abysmally turgid and laughably solemn. There's a whole lotta nothing going on here. The ending is straight out of weak Twilight Zone episode. I also found Shyamalan's obligatory, yet wholly gratuitous cameo to be oddly offensive. In the context of the film, his bit role struck me that this may be the way he sees himself with regard to this movie, whether he realizes it or not.",The Village

A more satisfying ending would've included the children finding about their parents deception and leaving to face the ""towns"" and their parents fears for themselves -- much like what was successfully done in a very similar film, The Truman Show.Secondly, Night needs to figure out what the word entertainment means. Gee whiz. He's in show business for crying out loud.",The Village
695,Chris-624,Shyamalan is 1 for 4!,2,11 August 2004,"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***With the disappointment of ""Unbreakable"" and ""Signs"" my expectations for ""The Village"" we understandably low. Surprisingly, it still managed to fall way short. The premise of the film, as outlined in the trailers, would have proved much more thrilling (and in some ways more believable) than the story that unfolds. The main problems with the film are these: 1) the ""twist"" can be spotted a mile away and when you realize what it is, you hope you're wrong because it's not only obvious, but uninteresting. 2) the film proves so unrealistic and to be almost laughably bad. Shyamalan is still riding the coat tails of ""The Sixth Sense"" (an amazing film in every respect), but the public is starting to realize that it looks like he only has one good film in him. One should wonder why with a $60 million budget and the full support of the studio, why he couldn't get another giant name (Bruce Willis, Bruce Willis, and Mel Gibson in the past).Could it be that the big names passed on the project? With any 2nd-tier director, this film would probably have gone straight to video.***SPOILERS***Let's look at the primary issues with the film that make it such a disappointment.When it's revealed to the audience that the village is actually present day and isolated in a nature preserve (although they certainly knew this long before the film reveals it) and the creatures in the woods are simply village elders in costume, this opens up a whole can of problems in and of itself:1) The handful of village elders must take endless turns running around the woods in costumes (day and night) to keep up the charade, yet no one has ever seen them going in or coming out...even though they're routinely caring an eight foot tall creature costume?2) Walker (Hurt) won't break his vow to go to the modern day town for medicine, but sends his blind daughter instead? And what kind of mother is Alice Hunt (Weaver) in that she's unwilling to break her vow and go to town herself? Her son is on the brink of death and she does nothing? Not believable.3) When Walker decides to reveal the truth to his daughter, he takes her to the cabin where one of the creature costumes is hidden. He tells her not to scream, but lets her discover the costume with her hands, to her horror and surprise. What kind of sadistic creep is this guy? Why not tell her what's going on instead of trying to scare the hell out of her? The simple (albeit weak) answer is that the director was simply trying to build suspense where he couldn't make it fit logically.4) We won't dwell too much on the blind woman outrunning Noah in full daylight. I don't care how heavy the costume might be, it just doesn't wash. This conflict should have been resolved better.5) Then there's the brief explanation by the director (in his cameo) about why planes never fly over the reserve. Whatever. Fine. We can let that one go along withe the fact that everything about the reserve is so mysterious, there must be all kinds of kids sneaking in, but I guess they never found the village.6) Perhaps the most awkward element that is never addressed is why these modern day Americans, living as early settlers, decide to speak antiquated English instead of the more common tongue they all spoke naturally? The obvious answer is again the director needing to manipulate the setting no matter how unrealistic. In truth, there is absolutely no reason for these villagers to not speak modern English (except, perhaps, with the exclusion of profanity to help promote their idealized world).There are other issues with the film, but I've probably wasted too much time on this weak piece of film-making. We all had such high hopes for Shyamalan after ""The Sixth Sense"". Perhaps it would be impossible to live up to them, but it's not too much to expect decent film-making from a man who, at one time, had the golden touch.",The Village
696,AnomyBC,"Ignore The Nay-Sayers, This Is A Brilliant And Important Film",10,6 August 2004,"I have no idea why so many people seem to dislike this film, but I assure you that they don't know what the *)&@# they're talking about. This is a truly incredible film that continues M. Night Shyamalan's reputation of genius, and I certainly would recommend you all at least see it before you judge it. I think maybe a lot of people came into it with the wrong idea about what it was, and that's why they were disappointed. This is not supposed to be a horror movie or a monster movie, or at least not in the traditional sense. Aside from about 3 points in the film, the director is not intending for people to jump out of their seats in fright. So if that's what you want, then don't see it.What this movie is, and what it's supposed to be, is a creepy, unsettling, and darkly humorous commentary on humanity, society, and the modern world. And although it may or may not be ripped off from a book (the author of a book with a similar story is apparently suing), it's certainly a unique and extremely thought-provoking cinematic experience. It's really hard to explain without giving away anything, but you'll likely be debating for quite some time over whether the village elders were right to create what they created and do what they did to preserve it, and whether their methods are used by real-life governments. And it's hard to really explain how this fits in, but it will also spawn debates about whether constantly hearing about horrible things in the news has a negative effect on society.Anyway, in addition to touching on a lot of fascinating subject matter, the film is also visually beautiful, with incredible use of color, and the two main characters are interesting, likable, and memorable. In the middle of the film the director actually switches the focus of the film from the seemingly central character to another character, which I think is a really fascinating and ballsy move from a story-telling perspective. Some people of course didn't like it, but I loved it. It reminded me of when Hitchcock killed off the main character in ""Psycho"". I love it when directors throw the traditional Hollywood moviemaking formula out the window like that.In any case, most of the negative things said about this film are pretty ridiculous. The movie is certainly not predictable, and it's certainly not ""slow-moving and dull"". The dialogue is occasionally cheesy, and some of the camera shots are annoying, but other than that the movie continues M. Night Shyamalan's tradition of near-flawlessness. As for the ending, I found it to be both greatly satisfying and greatly amusing : )Anyway, it really disgusts me that so many people have been saying negative things about this movie, because I really think that it's an incredible film. It may in fact be my favorite Shyamalan film, although it's very close between this and ""Unbreakable"" (I tend to think ""The Sixth Sense"" is slightly overrated). Please go see this if it sounds at all interesting to you, particularly if you appreciate art more than horror, because I think there's a very good chance that you'll greatly enjoy it. It's kind of a love-it-or-hate-it thing I guess, so I supposed there's a 50% chance you'll love it : ) Anyway, I give it a 10/10.And by the way, M. Night Shyamalan is only my 5th favorite director (my fav is Zhang Yimou), so don't dismiss this as the word of just some crazed Shyamalan fan : )",The Village

No one at the theater I saw this at seemed even remotely surprised by the big ending.The same was true of Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs.  The man is a hack.

698,fbeauvais,Interesting thematic but failed to deliver..,6,2 September 2004,"First the good. Even if it's far from perfect, this movie have something to offer to a lot of fans. And not only horror and sci-fi ones. First, there no doubt you will find some really good tension scenes during the 105 min of the flick length. And I mean really good and well filmed ! Watch for the one when they enter the caves to protect from the 'creatures'. You'll also find a couple of strong performances from solid actors and also a new actress revelation in Brice Howard. And, thirdly, let's also say that there's an really intriguing and mysterious plot that will keep you up awake for a big part of the movie. A story who revealed to be Shyamalan's metaphoric vision on the September 11th and the USA way of life. And he ain't so far from reality with his flick !The bad about this film is that it's too long and badly rhymed. Some choices made at the pre or post-production have probably ruined the success of a good but 'light' story about an interesting theme. And that, despite some good masterized scenes like i said earlier who made shyamalan technics shines. I personally think that a short film could have been a small 'chef d'oeuvre' while this big Hollywood production will still, in the end , not being considered to deliver for a lot of watchers. The idea you'll get after walking the cinema doors is that something should have been done in the wrong way... not a great dose of fear nor a good amount of fascination for an epic flick !",The Village
699,mdud,But their life is better than yours,9,23 August 2004,"I've sat here for a while and become increasingly annoyed with reviewers who seem to expect the earth from M. Night Shyamalan. Not only does he provide something which, for me, is a very thought provoking piece, matching it's fine acting only with it's exemplary casting, but he also yet again managed to baffle me into not being able to predict his trademark 'twist'. Hell, he even made four of my friends as well as myself laugh out loud near the beginning (you'll know when).The reason why I think this film hasn't seen such great reviews of late is that everyone's expecting something herculean - give the guy a break! You are only comparing him to his previous triumphs. Had this been any other director then this would have been the stand alone hit that was the Sixth Sense.However, <sigh> comparisons will forever be made with the Sixth Sense for the rest of his career so let's get on with it:The pace starts slow (hello, normal village life?!) but also builds slowly, changing your perception of the potential plot lines along the way. It successfully places just enough doubts in your mind about the potential plot lines you foresaw to keep it's edge almost throughout. Even when I had guessed what the twist was going to be, there were MORE twists!Unfortunately, I thought that Sigourney Weaver was underused but couldn't rightly see where she would be better placed or why that character would justify more film time - maybe an extended edition will do her more justice. Williams Hurt gives a dependable performance and Joaquin Phoenix plays the 'quiet type' very well. Bryce Dallas Howard does very well indeed although she can sometimes 'see' where she's running a little too well for my liking.All in all, I would rate this behind the Sixth Sense in my list of his favourites (not by much - I worked out THAT twist!) but a big step up from Signs.",The Village
700,YesterdayTommorow,Less Horror and More a Good Story with Good Twists,8,15 June 2019,"Not saying that Horror movies can't have good stories but this movie felt less like the whole point was simply to scare you. I found the characters to be very unique especially Lucius and Ivy, the main characters, as well as the elders of the village and Noah, a mentally challenged man. The acting from Lucius and Ivy (her especially) was superb and I think that drove the movie forward even when there was slow downs in action. Their relationship felt very genuine and was very sweet, especially a scene on their porch.
The movie does sort of have the M.Night twists and they are the good kind that make sense and add to the story. I would say there are two main twists and they are both very good.
Really excellent movie, highly recommend.",The Village

But if you did, give this one a chance, you will find it beautiful and haunting.Sure the are potential ""holes"" in the story, but is this a documentary? NO, so why can't fictions have holes as long as it communicates its theme? Which this movie does so eloquently. This is not a ""horror"" movie, like ""signs"" is not a ""sci-fi"" movie, rather the settings/backdrop of the story serves as a stage whereby we get a glimpse of the people and their struggle of facing their real fears. I found this movie so refreshing in that it does not follow tried true boring Hollywood formulas of any genre, rather it digs down deep into the story and communicates with us on that level.

Knight provides us with some plot twists that cause you to rethink the entire movie over and over again. But, guess what folks, there are no monsters of the woods. The only monster in this film is the society that these people have distanced themselves from. Murdering, money and dare I say, jealousy...the evils that cause human-kind to commit terrible acts upon themselves and others. If for nothing else, go for the story and the moral it tries to provide us. M. Knight is good at giving us that for our money! And I think it was symbolic in having the Village Founder's blind daughter travel back to society to retrieve the medicine. With her blindness, she still perceives the preserve officer's kindness...and hope for our society.",The Village
703,EamesTheForger,"Not Perfect, But Nonetheless A Good Film",9,17 December 2009,"Obviously, there was a lot of hype surrounding this film. The trailer made it out to be some kind of terrifying film, more like the Sixth Sense than anything else. Many people expecting a horror were disappointed, and for good reason. The film is not a horror film. It's more like a period drama with elements of horror.I had already heard about how horror fans were disappointed with it, and how the twist let some people down. I tried to watch it with an eye for what it's really about, but, in some ways, the fact that it never really had any climax of sorts to do with the horror aspect of it, or the relationship aspect of it, kind of let me down. That was the film's one problem: It didn't really make it's mind up about whether it wanted to turn scary or stick with it's original story.Other than that, there are many redeeming qualities to it. The story is, on the whole, well written, and the acting is brilliant, just look at the cast list and see why. The cinematography is superb, plus the lighting, which will make you fear the colour red throughout the whole film. But I won't say any more about that. Plus, James Newton Howard's score was incredible, perhaps one of his best.So, on the whole, it was a good film, but towards the end, it seems to go down the wrong path, and is a little disappointing. But still, 7 stars for a well captured and slightly spooky atmosphere, despite everything that I have said.",The Village

Secondly, do not listen to the imbecilic mass who are so inane as to grasp the powerful concept of this film. This movie is an example of perfection in movie making sense. All the actors excel in their roles. Especially Miss Ron Howard. I am sure director Ron Howard is a very proud father today. As to M.Night, cant thank him enough for making a movie of such caliber. Look forward to the future for more great films from him. The story without giving anything away, will keep you thinking. It is much less 'at the edge of your seat' like 6th sense was. But does have a few of those breath takingly intimidating scenes which puts you at the edge. Cinematography is exquisite.",The Village
705,agapejournal,Mixed bag,6,28 December 2004,"Shyamalan has enlisted an impressive cast in this film who all give fun performances. Unfortunately, like the plot itself, the great cast is ultimately left to dry. I'm beginning to wonder if Shyamalan makes the same film over and over again. The films always open with such promise, creepy, suspenseful. Like with his other films this one revolves around the ""suprise"" plot twist, but this time around it doesn't quite work. The ""surprise"" is pretty obvious and revealed much too early, pretty much killing the suspense. The film is beautifully shot, but all visual quotation of classic landscape paintings seem to distance the viewer more than bring them into the story. Sometimes the film sweeps you away with its sensuousness, but in the end it leaves you feeling cheated.",The Village
706,silverfish-1,Bryce Dallas Howard,9,7 September 2004,"That about sums it up. Bryce Dallas Howard is one of the best reasons to see this movie. She is talented, funny, and very beautiful. And I'm glad that Shyamalan had the smarts to cast her in her first featured role. Now, for the picture itself, it is a decent one. I'd give it about 2 1/2 stars. It can be sort of a letdown for some viewers. The thing about Shyamalan films that he should realize- they don't require a second viewing. Now, that may or may not be the director's intent. Perhaps his ideology is that ""great films should only be viewed once"" or something. That's an incorrect assumption. Great films make you want to see them again and again... At any rate, the film has some good qualitites. The cinematography is splendid. The period costumes as well as the dialogue are great. The choice of actors is superb. Adrien Brody, Brendan Gleeson, Cherry Jones (I just love her!) and the others, make for an interesting yarn. Go see it for yourself, with an open mind. You might like it. I did.",The Village

Well... The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs... they should know by now that M. Night Shyamalan, this generation's Hitchcock, is not necessarily a ""scary movie man."" It's all about suspense, and story-telling, and the story he tells here is a love story.I am always mesmerized by that powerful speech that William Hurt (who plays Ivy Walker's father) delivers about love, near the middle of the film. To me, that signifies the theme of the movie. It's the motivation for the characters' actions.And brilliant music!! James Newton Howard deserved more attention for that mystical, gorgeous score. Hilary Hahn is amazing; her haunting violin solos make the soundtrack a must as well as the DVD. One does not necessarily even have to watch the DVD to understand the emotions of the film when listening to her play.Go rent it again, if you were disappointed on its ""lack of scariness."" See it as a love story with a few ""Shyamalanian"" twists, and become enraptured.",The Village
708,ListenBucko,Style over substance yields disappointment,4,15 March 2005,"I saw the ending coming within the first five minutes of the film, which is unfortunate, but is the result of M. Night Shamalyan's heavy handed role as writer, director and producer. Having no one else to answer to, nor creative partners in the major shaping of the film. He had no one to point out that an astute movie viewer can very easily discern the ""hints"" given in various ways, and know nearly everything. The problem seems to be that Shamalyan is determined to duplicate the success of ""The Sixth Sense;"" clearly the backers of this film were hoping so, too. However, it's another ""Signs"" (also extremely predictable); a 'creepy' premise and the dressings of a suspense film, but with none of the satisfaction. In ""The Sixth Sense,"" I didn't see the end coming. However, if I'd seen ""The Village"" and ""Signs"" first, I probably would. I don't like being ""gimmicked"" and expected to buy into something contrived. No, in spite of having collected a fine cast and crew, the movie fails because it doesn't tell a good story. Shamlayan seems to have aspirations towards ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""The Outer Limits"" and other stylized movies and programs of their ilk. However, he's missed the point: they weren't good because they had an angle or a style, it was because they were GOOD. but it was the storytelling that did the job. Here, we have a flimsy construction of a story. However, even if you start getting caught up in what you suspect is happening, don't be surprised to find it losing steam on you. So we go down another level, and see if it's the people & the relationships that are the golden key. Nope. A fine cast, who worked well together, and some scenes did work nicely. But they worked nicely in spite of the movie; when people really clicked and connected each other, there sere sparks. But they couldn't carry the film, as it wasn't designed that way.William Hurt seems very well cast, and plays his character with great honesty and compassion, but there are only a few moments in the whole film that bring the best out of him. What's Sigourney Weaver even DOING in this movie? The character showed some promise earlier on, but it fizzled out and the she became one of the crowd. Joaquin Phoenix did a creditable job with his character, but it seemed more natural to him, and as the actor, he wasn't having to try to fight through the material. If Adrien Brody hadn't been playing Noah, I doubt I've have been interested at all. Brody makes it work because it's HIM. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty effective. Bryce Dallas Howard shows a lot of potential, but this was over her head under the direction of Shamalyan. She was not believable as a blind person; however, she clearly has the talent to be able to do so, IF the director had given her the coaching needed. She was very committed, but I doubt that the director ever told exactly what he was after. I'm not sure HE'S sure. All of the character moments seemed to come from the actors' own efforts, and kudos to them. Shamalyan just doesn't seem to direct scenes well. No surprise, if he's sitting in his trailer at night thinking about the concept and how he can tweak it even more to force us into paying good money to see this movie. The music (featuring a wonderful violinist)is also manipulative. Yes, every suspense/horror film works better with a good score, but the passion of the music at the ""critical scenes"" far outweighed what we were getting from the screen. So they seemed loud and out of place.A lot of the technical work is commendable. The music was good, but not used well. The cinematographer had many wonderful shots all throughout the film.... except that, in places, you could tell where Shamalyan MADE him take a self-consciously ""gimmick"" shot that didn't fit in with the rest of the camera technique. Scenic design was good, VERY good, and it provides important clues about what's going on. That's by intelligent design, but the lack of involvement in the characters lets the eye wander too much, and you are given more to know than you should at points. The costuming was effective in the same way, and leads you to some conclusions.All over, it's not a BAD film; it's watchable, and you'll like most all of the characters. However, if you've seen ""Signs,"" then you've pretty much seen this one and vice versa. My recommendation is to see ""The Sixth Sense,"" skip these other two, and wait until Shmalyan comes out with some material with depth. Perhaps the people who were signing the checks this time, looking at their returns, may indeed themselves consider to tell Shamlyan that there'll be no more of this. He's a very talented director, but his writing isn't on the same level, and directing your own work might seem egotistical to some. He'd be much better off concentrating on direction, take on a co-writer, and working with a producer who'll twist his arm at the right times. Movie making is a COLLABORATIVE art, and it's high time that Shamalyan learns this for himself and learns how to trust other people to do theirs. I will not go see his next offering until some of my more trustworthy fans scope it out first.",The Village

710,craig-193,Pleasantly Surprising,10,14 September 2004,"I wasn't too hopeful when I went in to see this film, having seen all of the critics pan it, and lots of people say that it was dull, boring, etc. Which is why it was an especially pleasant surprise for me that not only was this movie not dull, it was actually rather good.Set in 19th century Pennsylvania, it's not a ""thrill-a-minute"" horror ride, but if you were expecting that... then you deserve what you get, since this film never claimed to be that. Instead you get a much more subtle horror film, which is scary because it builds and builds and builds. Like most other films by Shyamalan, there's more twists in here than a mountain road, and while some of them are rather predictable, the ones that aren't still manage to throw the story in unexpected directions.For those that are critical of this film for being ""dull"", might I suggest that a movie like ""Catwoman"" might be more to your taste? For the rest of us though, who crave intelligently crafted films like this that don't treat the audience like imbeciles, ""The Village"" is a winner.",The Village

I will definately have to buy it when it comes out though. My boyfriend,  who is a sucker for scary movies was able to sleep that night.  I thought the actors were absolutely wonderful.  It could have been scarier which i was exspecting.  If they hadn't have told who/what the ''creatures it would have been better.  I hope that they make a sequel.

Night Shyamalan film set in the past, what would be the biggest twist, I know, it's not really the past, gasp.I wasn't even surprised when I saw the film to realise I was right, I had a moment of movie psychic clarity, or the director is predictable.I actually like the film, it works on some levels as an old fashioned scary movie, the creatures feel terrifying when you see them and the way they appear in the background made me gasp.I noticed that during the films first 10 minutes they mention ""those we do not mention"" quite a lot, rending them those we appear to often mention, from the audiences P.O.V. I like most of the cast, they are great actors and bring an appropriate gravitas to the proceedings, Weaver is excellent, always, Phoenix is intense, Brody is also always reliable and takes brave roles and Howard seems likable and I really cared for her plight.It's entertainment, drama and some history muddled with a silly ending that may actually cheapen the whole movie, still it's something different, even if I did guess the ending a year before the film was released.I like The Village, but I wouldn't want to live there.",The Village

Now, I'm a person that doesn't go out to haunted houses or see scary movies at midnight with the full moon out and the sounds from the movie playing full blast, and I really don't want to see scary movies.  I've seen Signs and it wasn't too bad for me.  I read some imdb.com posts and read there was a big twist at the end.  I just wasn't sure what was going to happen.Adrien Brody was sort of funny throughout the movie because his character is mentally retarded.  It's his character that brings some comic relief to the film.  Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy sort of confused me a bit because I wasn't sure if her character was blind or not.  It finally came together after awhile, but you really had to sit there and watch it.  Joaquin Phoenix as Lucius was fine, but nothing too spectacular.  His character was just there.All in all, the movie was fine and there weren't too many scary scenes at all.SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!What I don't understand is how Lucius could survive a knife being sliced into his stomach and his heart.  How is that really possible?  And What about a blind girl finding her way through the woods by herself, getting to her destination, and getting back safely.  One last point.

The synopsis, the trailer and other promotional materials of this movie are misleading to the point of being a bold lie.  That aside, the film is really not that great: M. Night tries stretch out the suspense but it ends up becoming thin and boring in places; Brody's mentally-handicapped character remarkably manages to overcome his disability at just the right moments, over-conveniently serving the plot.  Although, for the most part M. Night's talent as a director is on full display; as well, he has assembled a great cast (as usual).  Nonetheless, I can't help but feel disappointed in the fact that I didn't get what I was promised in the ads.

Unfortunately that's really about as interesting as M. Night Shyamalans latest offering gets.Beautifully set in the woodlands of middle America, this little township certainly looks the part with excellent set design, cinematography and visual shots. This coupled with excellent sound effects certainly builds it up to being a Shyamalan movie. So far so good it looks and very importantly for this genre sounds the part too with excellent creepy noises from the darkness.Character development is where this movies starts to slide, William Hurt the towns elder is simply a cardboard cut out bellowing out warnings and historical fact, Sigorney Weaver simply isn't in any way remotely interesting or important to this movie as her script and her role seem pointless. I genuinely thought Joachim Phoenix would be the saving grace or at least give us a little comedic relief like his character in Signs, but he barely even has lines and stumbles across the ones he does have. Bryce Dallas Howard is very good in what she has to do and is a star to look out for in the future, but sadly will not be remembered for this role.Then, as per all Shyamalan movies, is the twist in the tale, well maybe this movie simply was thought out as well, but i figured it out from about half way through which simply ruined the movie for me. It wasn't nearly as surprising or interesting and any of his previous movies even the poor Unbreakable was better and more believable than this. The most thought provoking thing about Shylamans movies is the twist and in this simply fizzles out and leaves you feeling nothing for this movie no love, no thought, and a lack of caring for it. Maybe he has exhausted this type of movie now, this was one twist movie too many i feel. He should try his hand at telling a good story instead of trying to make us think about the movie when we leave, because most people wont think about this movie at all.",The Village

Still, they go on living as if there is nothing strange or unusual going on beyond the borders of their small village. The rules of the village are not to cross the borders into the woods, let the bad color, red, not be seen, and when the warning bell rings, run for cover.After a while, the people of the village get warning visits from the creatures, leaving red slash marks on their doors.

719,infinajt,Blind State,7,12 September 2008,"Some people in the industry are just lost causes. I really have given Shyamalan chances, many more than any other on/off director has gotten. That's because he seems to have pretty solid ideas about giving a movie that special personal touch, which is always an appreciable trait. And because he DOES have ideas that, now and then, are more valuable than your average episode of Outer Limits.The main problem is just that as a writer, he is horrible, and perhaps because of his ""slight"" egoism, there seems to be no one to tell him when he crosses the line. I think 'Unbreakable' is his only good movie, and that's because there was a narrative trick that was too simple to be screwed up by what was actually happening in the script (Bruce wasn't the main character!).This is his second best, I guess. It IS flawed, but has some interesting stuff going on. I actually felt bad for a while for Shyamalan, because the marketing section falsely decided to advertise this as a horror movie - which it is not, as many have pointed out. But that's not the issue here: the idea in this one is all about seeing the structures that build up a society. Terror as a way to control. Tragedy as a trigger for change. Secrecy for 'greater good'. Outcast as a monster. All 'seen' by a blind girl as our lead. Of course the blindness here is just poor symbolism, but it's important that SHE doesn't see. In the end, she still can't be sure if the threat exists. Has the lie lived so long that it has become real?But it's constructed poorly. Shyamalan wants his twist, so the entire narrative builds just for that moment, and after that, it dies completely. And before that, all commentary is lost because we just want to know the catch. I wonder what it would have been like if WE had known the truth from the beginning? Not scary at all, of course, but maybe a bit more meaningful. Compare, for instance, 'From Hell' the graphic novel to its movie adaptation.Actors do okay with their paper-thin characters. Shyamalan's use of camera and cuts, which I considered refreshingly original in his earlier movies, is already becoming boring here. Afterwards, in 'Lady in the Water', it's just stupid.But nice try, anyway. At least here he didn't cast himself as the writer who saves the plot.",The Village

Bryce Dallas Howard rocks! I would recommend it to anyone. This movie will have you feeling every emotion. I cried more than once. True, it is not as scary as say Signs, but it was still enjoyable.

While it had the Shyamalan style that we've all seen before in Signs, and Unbreakable, it lacked the new elements, that spark of creativity. Shyamalan went from making moveis to following a formula to success. Same plot different setting. Nothing is what it seems and we all learn a valuable life lesson in the end. The cinematography for the Village was still amazing as ever. Shyamalan has a way with the cameras that just make a good film. The pans, angles, fades and cuts all mesh together to make a frightful yet emotional story. If only the plot could follow.

But much to my disappointment, I found The Village to be nothing like his other films, and definitely of worse quality The first thing I felt watching this film was absolute confusion. The main characters weren't introduced until about midway through, giving very little time to develop them. In fact, they were so undeveloped, I didn't even care when things happened to them. I began rooting for the ""creatures"" that lived in the village to please end this miserable film.And that's just my problem with the characters.The plot was flimsy, unclear, and definitely not the horror plot of the year. It seemed as if the direction had jotted some notes on paper and then the rest of the crew somewhat tried to follow them. With a weak plot and character development, I was not happy.But I'm not finished.I didn't find one aspect of this movie frightening in the slightest. There were some parts where my friends and I got ready to scream, only to burst into laughter at the ridiculous attempts to scare us.I give this movie a 3/10, just because I'm still a ""Night"" fan.

I think that The Village has much in common with signs in regards to how the story is told. for me its simply to slow and there is no twist or crescendo at the end to justify the almost two hour long buildup. The story is also too transparent, i think it took me about ten minutes to figure out the plot. The acting was OK, but not anything special considering the cast. especially Sigourney weaver got little or no possibilities to show of her talents. I would also like to note that the trailers for the movie was misleading in terms of what kind of atmosphere and genre this movie is in.

Each of his films is like a puzzle that seems simple once someone shows you the secret. That's why the craftsmanship is so impressive. They all contain lessons about life, as well, especially about the fears we all harbor, and the ways we have been given to confront them.This film makes Bryce Dallas Walker a star. She shines bright as a heroine few will ever forget. Joaquin Phoenix, who played Merrill in ""Signs,"" is at his brooding and enigmatic best. And Adrien Brody gives his character, who serves as a counterpoint to the others, a bemusing innocence mixed with the wildness and irrationality of a force of nature.The film has the feel of a parable or allegory throughout, and a Gothic quality that adds to the power of the denouement.

729,marntfield,Pure Genius!... Nobody Likes That I Guess,9,30 June 2005,"**POSSIBLE SPOILERS** The Village is not unlike many other post-millennial films which serve as reflexive cultural statements on top of being brilliant films. As a result it also consequently, and regrettably, alienates a large portion of viewers who simply don't get it. It's usually because they either lack the life experience, analytical skills, appreciation of art and the interplay between images and music, or simply possess an IQ comparable to lower order primates. They also likely haven't seen any of Night's other work, for if they had, they would know that what you see is never what you get with his films, and that we should never expect anything as banal as a simple horror film in the traditional sense from him. I believe that part of the problem in the way this film was, and still is, received, may have had to do with the fact that it was marketed as such, when in reality this film is both a period piece and a character piece. Yes, at times it is suspenseful, but it is primarily an allegory about our own society, and not just ""the village"" per se. People often decry the film as far fetched when the real time period is revealed, but is it really? Humans are born as blank slates and we know only what we learn. We lack the natural instincts of many animals and in turn engineer the architecture of the ""natural"" world and impose it on ourselves. We are a self domesticated and controlled species and if you don't think that the various institutions which control our lives have us believing in 100 or more varieties of ""those we don't speak of"" think again. There is indeed a forest beyond the perimeter of the little society in which we live, and which we are more or less forbidden from venturing into. Public schooling, organized religion, and a commodity driven economy all sustain themselves on it. The Village makes this observation in a more subtle way, however, and the villagers themselves all serve to represent anthropomorphized versions of the day dreams all of us have from time to time about a proverbial ""escape"" to a simpler life. The film taps into that natural human desire, however irrational it may be, and demonstrates that even in such a utopia, people still need to fear and believe in things untrue in order to maintain cohesion. Notwithstanding its cerebral underpinnings, the film contains beautiful images and music and terrific performances by mostly learned stage actors. It is a powerful film at both the aesthetic and psychological levels, and I applaud Night for not selling out to the lowest common denominator and for continuing to make films which defy trends and keep on challenging us. For those who didn't like it because it lacked cool 'splosions, I would suggest wading into the commentary thread for something like 2 Fast 2 Furious.

What is true is that he makes movies that shatter preconceived notions. The Village looks to be about monsters in the woods when in fact it is about belief. This film asks a question of it's audience: Is ignorance truly bliss? I can see from some of the negative reviews that in some cases it may be. It's easier to keep living the lie that is a ""M.

Not very often do I leave the theatre with a smile on my face - - excellent movie, smartly done, worth every minute.Pay attention.  It's fun.  Not very often does my family all see a movie at the same time, and we spent most of dinner going through the details that we wouldn't have ordinarily paid attention to.

At any rate, I think you're overall opinion of this movie will depend on how you feel about the twist at the end. Maybe that's why there's so many 10s and 1s on the board. Either you'll think the ending is brilliant or you'll hate it. Other than that, it comes down a lot to expectations. When I saw Signs I was expecting something totally different, and walked away disappointed. I think most people felt the same about Unbreakable, even though there's a lot of good to be said about those movies. Even though this movie does have a twist ending, it isn't the Sixth Sense. It isn't too terribly scary either, though it has a few moments. I think if you go into this movie not expecting so much, you'll get a lot more out of it. I did like the cast a lot. At first I wasn't sure what I felt about Ron Howard's daughter, but she came through in the end. Adrien Brody, as usual, put in a great performance. Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt are also worth mentioning. The dialogue wasn't too bad, and neither was the acting. There were moments before the beginning where I didn't care much for the editing, and why were there so many slow motion shots? They didn't really seem to fit in this movie. So, there you have it.

738,DreamHunter,Poor guy . . .,9,4 August 2004,"Pity M. Night Shyamalan. That twist ending from The Sixth Sense is going to haunt him forever. My advice: don't go into The Village with the wrong expectations. Look at this as a story, not a mind-trick.Personally, I really liked it. Good performances bring interesting characters to life. The suspense is present at all times, even when you have figured out what's going on (or think you have). And yes, there are a couple of neat surprises throughout the movie. Will the ending make you re-think the whole experience? Um, no, but not every movie has to pull the rug from under you. I'm more concerned with having a connection with what's going on in the screen, with being involved in the story. Something that's difficult to achieve when you focus on trying to second-guess the plot.Now, granted, I'm not saying this is the case with every person that goes to see the movie and doesn't like it. I can completely understand people being turned off by Shyamalan's slow pacing, the odd speech patterns he gives to his characters, his old-style approach to suspense (not showing the threat unless it's absolutely necessary and even then, only barely, most of the time), etc. Personally, I like it. I like his style, and it's been pretty consistent throughout his movies (all of which I've enjoyed a lot, with the exception of The Sixth Sense, which was ok but definitely was an instance where the gimmick made the movie). So here I am, jumping in to defend a movie whose biggest sin seems to be that it didn't set out to do what its audience expected it to.Oh, well.

739,Jeffscr5,Best Allegory in Response to 9/11 (Spoilers),10,31 July 2004,"Innocence and Hope is what the villagers in the small utopian community put all their stock in. The goal of its founders is to engender a community of interdependence and purity in a world inundated with greed, crime, and injustice. The elders achieve their goal by injecting fear(terrorism and personal safety) into the hearts and minds of the young village citizens by inventing mysterious creatures(Al-Qaeda) and then empowering this enigma with a set of strict rules(Patriot Act) that all must abide by. This fear occupies their provincial minds so that they are unable to look past their highly-protected (governed) border and into the masked reality. This fear causes blindness and ignorance (confidential government) which over period has a byproduct of innocence. The fear is perpetuated by acts of violence (Terrorist alert levels and threats) to remind the citizens of evil which unsettles their safety and builds fear, which in turn leads to dependency on governing leaders (George WALKER Bush). Consequences and repercussions (War on Iraq) are immediate when the community regulations (safety of the innocent) are violated in order to build fear. In this case, the violators and peacekeepers are members of the same unified community; therefore, the response comes in the form of non-violent ambiguous warnings to increase their fears (Opposite the divided world we live in). The leaders in this case are also the ones who perpetuate the fear (government and media), which in turn helps to maintain the young's innocence (average citizen). The leaders are the only ones cognizant of reality (confidential government), which, in turn, leads them to be the fabricators of the masked reality (Weapons of masked destruction?) that they place over younger citizen's eyes (average citizen). The governing body channels all of the citizen's hatred at these mysterious creatures (Terrorists) causing them to unify as collective body to protect themselves (our temporary unified patriotic nation), and unknowingly their innocence and hope. In order for unanimous unification there must be only one enemy (Iraq), enemies within the unified community cannot exist. Eventually, the village's innocence is threatened within by the inescapable human nature- jealousy, crime, and impurity manifest themselves within the village borders. Human beings proclivity to sin since the fall of man has produced every type of evil that exists. The catalyst for this evil is another inescapable human characteristic- their ability to love. Theories of dichotomy claim that in order fully know something you must also know its polar opposite. Naturally, if one claims to love they are also claiming to hate. If love exists hate exists. If hate exists, evil exists.Evil was manifested in the form of jealousy (capitalism and democracy) that caused a violent act of injustice (suicide planes). The audience is given the reality through horrifying stories of the elders which prompted them to create a protective innocent community. In the outside the fear has many faces and it is propagated not only by the governing but also by the media. The two pages of newspaper shown in the corrupt world contained five stories all of them dealing with crime. People are forced to live in fear because it surrounds them and this fear affects every single move they make. Therefore, the sick-cycle of fear as a protector and inhibitor continues. Juxtaposition also occurs in the environments. The village is: self-sufficient, utopian, pure, protected, self-governing, and selfless. Whereas, the world outside its boundaries is war torn, crime infested, self-serving, and filled with greedy capitalists (Trump). The only common denominator is that they both thrive on fear. The biggest separation between the two is how they use that fear in balancing the love versus hate continuum. In the village, love drastically outweighs hate. In the world outside the village's boundaries hate overwhelms love.The second factor that threatens the village's innocence is man's mortality. Man's mortality causes the fear that breeds all other fears, the fear of death. Man's mortality also plays a role in preserving their goals when they are no longer around. Eventually it would be time for the next generation to lead the following generations (leadership changes). In order for them to take control they must lose their innocence and fill that void with hope- a hope that what they are doing(war) is justifiable to those they protect(citizens) with their decisions and regulations.Fear resides in every character of the film. Ivy, who is blind, is proof that fear is the result of physical being, it is an emotion created by the limits of our imagination. The character of Luscious was proclaimed as fearless, until he found purpose in his life. Prior to proclaiming is love for Ivy, Luscious felt that his purpose in life was to use his fearlessness to help others who fear. However, when love set in, Luscious' new purpose was to protect the one he loved because he feared for her death. The love he felt for his mom and the love he felt for Daniel did not cause such emotion, platonic love did. It was apparent that the roles of the elders would be passed down to Ivey and Luscious because they were had leadership qualities and they had the respect of everyone in the town. However, fear did not set in to the mind of Noah because he was mentally incapable. It takes mentally disturbed individual (Bin Laden) to violate the social contract of the world, but his insurrection was transient because it was only for personal gain. Noah fulfilled his purpose in the community; he became the severe symbol for fear. His death restored justice, helped propagate the secret of the village through fear, and supplanted the old non-violent consequences of breaking the rules with a more severe punishment.The movie's second twist shows that while this seemed to be an event of the past (colonial America) it is in fact contemporary. (9/11; corrupted reality)MNS strikes gold again: by twisting the audience's perception of reality, getting superb performances from his actors, while inspiring and enlightening his audience. MNS is not only the greatest director of our time, he is one of the greatest screenwriters of our time- scripts filled with powerful messages, rousing soliloquies(like Hurts in Village, Gibson's in Signs, and Jackson's in Unbreakable), humor, in a PG-13 format. Just like every other MNS film this gets a 10/10.",The Village
740,anwdavis,A convert,10,14 June 2009,"I have never been a thriller movie advocate. When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought: please it is so easy to see, immediately thinking that this was signs all over again, never going to see the film in the movie theater. I am ashamed of myself.Some would have you think it is interesting not to show the creature because it makes the film more thriller driven, I think of such movies as Alien, but this isn't Alien. The creature needs explanation, and is a pivotal piece of the plot. This is more of a mystery, rather than a thriller. A good mystery summarizes. A writer, knows that many modern people will not look for the answers. A film is no different. Had the answers not been delivered there would be no purpose to this work. It reminds me of having very child-like story aspects, magical aspects, that I appreciate. It is Walden on a larger scale, and still leaves philosophies to be pondered by the viewer, which are all aspects of a very good film and story.If you have missed this title, I feel sad for you.",The Village
741,Ian Bradly,Fantastic - but here is how you should walk into the theater,10,6 August 2004,"Don't see the movie for a twist that will have you gasping. See it for a story that will have you thinking.I wonder if Night's movies weren't marketed as ""An M Night Shyamalan Film"" people wouldn't have such expectations. So many people were down of it just by watching the preview.
I hope M Night continues makes his movies.  They are original and entertaining.  Plus they are not some dumb remake of another movie or a television show.Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was worth the price of admission alone.",The Village
742,puddinstreet,M. Night's worst effort,3,3 August 2004,"Before I get started on my rant, I'd like to clarify that I love M. Night Shyamalan. I believe he is one of those raw talents who understands, loves, and excels in the art of film-making. I also believe that he is a true genius and adds genuine substance to his movies. The Village, however, I felt, I was a huge failure.Naturally the cinematography was brilliant and the cast was great.The acting direction is what suffered the worst, having amazing actors speaking terrible dialogue in very unnatural affectations.Jake Brody had glimmers of greatness, but overall did not seem to fully understand his role and came off as hokey and unrealistic.William Hurt played the worst role of his career, and sigourney weaver was absent from the entire film, even in the scenes she was in. The movie's strength, and basis, was its socio political implications, what seemed to me to be his interpretation of Plato's allegory of the cave, and how people choose to live in ignorance in preference to knowing the truth and risking the fear that goes along with it. On the political standpoint it is a metaphor for a society being manipulated through fear of attack, being forced into self censorship and seclusion. However, this was too blatant, and did not form into a cohesive film. I loved the village, save for the cheesy ending, and I think that Unbreakable is one of the most brilliant underrated films in recent history, and don't even get me started on The Sixth Sense. I could not, for the life of me, however recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in anything more than aesthetic virtuosity. Hopefully M. Night's next film will leave this one in the dust. 3/10",The Village
743,chassprague,very disappointing and boring beyond belief...,1,6 February 2005,"This movie is so slow, paint peels faster. It was just so SLOW. The things that were supposed to be mysterious, were really just annoying.The dates on the grave stones was supposed to set this story in the late 1800's, but the story was so lame it didn't even seem right, so the ""surprise"" at the end really wasn't a surprise at all, I expected something like that.To me, if your going to tell a story like that, you really have to bend over backwards to make the audience believe it, and this really didn't do it. It just seemed like a bad movie to me, and all the phony pretension and fake mysteriousness just make it fall flat.Oh, and the part where they send a BLIND girl, yes, a BLIND girl out into the WOODS by herself, to go to town to get medicine, was just unbelievably stupid. At that point, I had to ask, what kind of idiot made this film? Does he think the audience are complete morons who are just going to believe ANYTHING? How does she know which way to go? People with sight get lost in the woods, how is a BLIND girl supposed to find her way? By losing her walking stick, and running?I have admired some of the directors past films, but I'm certainly going to think twice before watching any more of his films. I couldn't sit through another stinker like this one.I hate to be totally negative in a review, so I will say that the scenery was nice, the cinematography was beautiful, the acting was OK, as was the music score. But the script stank. The dialogue was so slow, it could bore you to tears. No matter how high the production values, nothing can save a bad script. I would have liked to have given it a higher rating, but when after watching it, you feel like you have wasted your time, it's hard to say anything good about that.What I found most amazing was the high ratings in the votes. I'm amazed that anyone found the ending surprising. I see nearly half the votes came from outside the USA. The director no doubt has a lot of fans overseas.",The Village

I kept waiting for Adrian Brody to play the piano, but alas, he's the village idiot. (I'll wager he really felt like one after seeing this mess.)Joaquin is looking more like Mel Gibson every day. The only thing scary about this dreck was it was almost 2 hours long. The theater was packed but the audience left disappointed; there were moments during the film when we all laughed...but I don't believe the director was trying to be funny. It has plot holes big enough to drive a truck through and the explanation of the supernatural ""goings on"" is not only moronic, but implausible (if not impossible). Once we realized this film was a dud, we had a good time making fun of it a la MST3K. Save your money and wait for cable.",The Village

The myriads of plot holes and inconsistencies don't make it better. I think I won't spoil anything if I say that there's an oh-so-surprising twist at the end, but this can't save the movie, it actually makes it worse: for one you can see it coming quite early and then it's simply stupid.The cast features some great names and some of the characters have the potential to be interesting, but ultimately all are bland and forgettable.

While this movie does maintain the thrilling elements common to all of Shyamalan's films, it is not the horror thrill-ride it was billed as.Instead, this film is a beautifully filmed, magically told allegory. As with all of his films, what you see on the screen is only the 'tip of the iceberg'--it is your responsibility as a film-goer to search for all of the interesting social commentary that hides and hovers beneath the surface.So, in short, film-goers who enjoy contemplation will love this movie.

I usually find that I agree with such behemoths of film critics as Eburt and Robert, but they made a big mistake downgrading this movie. This is a great film, but a film that has more in common with ""Donnie Darko"" than ""The 6th sense"". This film is a great allegory; my hat goes of for Mr.Shamyalan for having shot this film, which is so much bigger and more beautiful, than the 6th sense. If I may compare movies to food, 6th sense is like McDonalds fajitas, fast food easy to consume, yet spicy, new and satisfying. The Village I would compare to a glass of good wine.

749,gallowglas,What a mess of a story.,5,23 November 2005,"And once again M. Night Shayamalan delivers a ""tale with a twist"". And once again the ""twist"" is not exactly a twist but a violation or even contradiction of the before told story. No matter how fictitious a story may be, it has to have its own set of rules and its own logic that must not be discarded lest the story get's inconsequential - which is exactly what happens to ""The Village"". Speaking of plot holes would seem unfair to other bad scripts that at least struggle to build a plot around the holes. ""The Village"" leaves you with the holes only. Ironically, many audiences seem too believe that if they didn't spot the ""twist"" it must have been very clever - as opposed to being plain stupid.This said, the acting, apart from maybe the most unrealistic depiction of a blind person ever witnessed, ranges from mediocre to solid performances. The cinematography is atmospheric and befits the scenery.

And in watching this by M. Night Shyamalan had me predisposed to think that this was just another run-of-the-mill monster movie, but it was not. It was a movie, and tale about just about any person or people, and experiences, and about going to the extreme in finding a solution to a problem(s) that holds in sway, if not grips everyday life. From the locked box, to the shed; the so called ""quiet-room,"" to the designated colors; from the commandments, and even to the prominent family surname the movie was woven into a tale that had communities from the Amish (since it was in PA), to the extreme of cults, or even the Branch Davidians of Waco leaping initially to mind. However, what kept the interest piqued were the 'creatures,' or the beasts that held this isolated community voluntarily captive, if not united, until the unexpected happened which had the community, and its elders and leaders considering to break a long held pact.The manner in which it was performed was mediocre, however how the story unfolded, and plot thickened (so to speak) was exceptional - IMHO.

Good characters, good plot, and its just original.I liked Signs for similar reasons. I think MNS's strength was putting a realistic spin on sci-fi and fantasy. He had a unique way of introducing you in to those realms from the point of view of a realistic, non-fiction character. The Village is another example, and it succeeded.I couldn't stand the Lady in the Water and The Happening.

It seems to me that he tries to use the same kind of twists and turn in every movie he does.When I saw the trailer for ""The Village"" I suspected that the twist would be that they are living in present time but hoped that M Night had something up his sleeve that could fool me as he did in ""Sixth Sense"".

755,Kueko,"""The Village"" has the clues without the mystery",5,13 May 2005,"""The Village"" comes from a long line of critically acclaimed M. Night Shyamalan films, so naturally the expectations are high for this latest offering. I'd like to say it measured up, but the only word I can honestly use to describe this film is ""disappointment"". The movie may be a victim of Shyamalan's own success, causing audiences to draw comparisons between ""The Village"" and his other films (like ""The Sixth Sense""). More troublesome though, I think, is the misleading advertising which may have led some of us to believe ""The Village"" is a horror/suspense film  it's not.""The Village"" is set in the late 1800s in a small village called Covington. Covington is isolated from the rest of civilization, as it is completely surrounded by woods. These woods are home to things so terrible, so horrifying, that the villagers of Covington can only refer to them as ""those we do not speak of"". And it is these ""creatures"" that keep the villagers in Covington after all these years, their fears amplified by the stories the village elders tell them.While that may sound like a set-up for a great horror movie, or even an intense suspense thriller, it's really neither. Instead, in the first two thirds of the movie we are presented with a bizarre love triangle, which may be interesting on some level, if that is what we had come for. There are a few small thrills in between the slow, plodding atmospheric sequences with little-to-no interesting development among the characters and plot. It's almost as if while writing the script, Shyamalan completed the ending first, and worked backward, trying desperately to fill time until the movie could reach its rather anti-climatic end. The few twists the movie presents along the way could only surprise a very unperceptive viewer  perhaps one who made several trips to the bathroom during the film.I suppose in its own right, ""The Village"" is a vaguely entertaining film, and I can certainly appreciate it for its foreshadowing (although it's hardly needed considering how obvious the ending is by the halfway point). I always love a mystery that gives you the clues along the way so you can solve the mystery yourself if you are perceptive enough. The Village got that right, now if only the mystery was stronger.",The Village
756,december_starz,The Village left much to be desired,5,13 February 2005,"With all of the hype that came with this film, I was very disappointed when I saw the finished product. Having seen Signs and The Sixth Sense, I was expecting a horror/thriller genre movie, with the kind of twist at the ending that left audiences speechless as in Night's past films.The storyline in The Village was weak; the script was not well-written at all. It was as though all of the actors (with the exception of Joaquin Phoenix, who never spoke above a whisper for the entire film) were trying too hard to be old-fashioned - it was all very artificial. All in all, I felt that if this film had left more to the imagination and had flowed better (script-wise), I would have liked it a good deal more. As it was, I was left wanting more after the ending. A good premise was not done justice in the making of this film. I'm going to give it five stars, simply because I believe that this director and cast could have done better.",The Village

First of all this is not a horror/scary movie as the trailer perceives it to be; its a humanistic piece about fear of the unknown and about the loss of innocence. This is simply a drama and i think viewers weren't expecting that. Its wonderfully acted especially by Howard who deserves Oscar attention! The story has simple elements but very complex meaning. Its about love and sacrifice and how fear can be put away forever by them. I know this sounds real corny but its true. This movie is amazing.

To start with, **Spoiler Alert**, it base meaning was to be happy, you can easily live in the most simple of ways, the way they were living in a village, far from civilization, bound by fears and folk tales (this movie also teaches a lesson about tales and fear, if you stop believing in 'em, you're Superman!), and the last bit was such a shock! One helluva amazing movie...left me with goosebumps, and then there's M Night's cameo...really 'artsy' way of showing that...some people might actually miss it...and in the end, when everything makes sense...one thing leads to another, leading to a 'oh, so that's why SHE went!'...Really neat...",The Village
759,dam33000,One Of My Favourite Movies,10,1 October 2012,"For me, the village is the best movie directed and written by Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense and Lady in The water come after this one) and the best movie i've seen in the 2000's (coupled with Mulholland Drive) and i've seen more of 1200 movies, came out between 2000 and 2009.The first time i saw The Village i loved all of it. The incredible cast (Bryce Dallas Howard is powerfully moving and a very talented beautiful actress), the perfect visual direction, classic but so perfectionist in the choice of what to film or not (the moving scene of the first kiss between Lucius and Ivy and that image of an empty chair to leave the characters in their privacy...), the powerful and heady score by James Newton Howard, the gorgeous photography by roger deakins and finally the great script. What is the most powerful thing for a studio picture, made for large audiences, is the fact that The Village is a parable. A lot of people didn't get that fact when the movie came out. It's a melancholic drama about fear and how good people, hurt by the violence of our modern societies, became awful people, controlling others with fear, in order to find again an innocence in the past that never existed. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. And the irony the elders understood at the end of the picture is that violence or cruelty is everywhere in every one of us and a simple minded supposed to be innocent without violence in his bones will be the first to break their illusions. A great parable about our troubled world at that time (Irak's War, 9/11...). Signs was the previous movie of Shyamalan who started filming after the 9/11 and it devastated the crew when filming. We can see in this previous movie the shadow of that period (the isolation, the brutality against aliens) so his next movie would be more explicit about those troubled times. Here come the village. What is admirable too is the fact that Shyamalan never judged his characters. Everyone has a motivation and human flaws. All the powerful lines, moments... Ahhh The Village... I never understood why so much people hated it when it first came out. Even though many people didn't like it the movie had great success at the box office. I didn't expect people to hate Lady in the water too !10/10",The Village
760,tolboz,The only surprise is that there is no surprise,4,21 June 2005,"After the first time I watched this movie I was thinking that it was an okay movie. However, after I thought about this a bit, I realized the movie plot had too many flaws and illogical/improbable story lines. I liked the twists in the movies sixth sense and unbreakable, but this was neither interesting nor surprising. So I guess, the twist is that you keep waiting for something surprising in the end and there is none. Anyway, many people pointed out the flaws and wrote many lines of comments on these. I'll just raise some questions here: *) So these are people who are fed up with the corruption and crimes of the 20'th century. Why the hell did they choose to dress like Amish when they went to seclusion? *) Obviously, they have lost other people and kids due to illnesses and diseases before. They came to this place because they all lost loved ones in the modern world, yet they seem to be okay for a long time when they lost people to curable diseases. Does not make sense. *) What is the deal between Sigourney Weaver's character and William Hurt's character? They seemed to have some suppressed feelings for each other, but we do not know what that is? I guess adultery was frowned upon in the village although platonic love is okay! *) What is the deal with Adrian Brody's character? Such a poor performance of the village idiot! *) I would be happier if the creatures turned out to be non-humanoid aliens using the village as a petri dish and the village people finally figured this out and decided to rise up and fight them.

People in the reviews say they knew all along what was going on well I did not.I am not good at seeing scary movies because it is not my taste, but this one was more a suspense and good enough to see for a 10 year old.I can only say I liked it and its worth seeing.It has a little of everything, romance, drama, suspense and final twist at the end.There maybe more scary movies like the descent, the wrong turn about cannibals and mutants but I prefer a story like this one my whole family cane see of course excluding my 4 year old one.",The Village
762,charlotte_cloud,Yay. Enjoyable/not to be over analyzed,4,23 August 2004,"I saw The Village last night with no preconceptions except, ""didn't he do SIGNS! PAH!"". Hoping that this would be more sixth sense and less unbreakable/signs, I went along to see this film. The village, in my humble opinion, exceeds the quality of the sixth sense. This Shyamalan guy has a really great sense of timing and suspense. The atmosphere is incredible, especially in a cinema with really loud surround sound. Well done to whoever did the sound on this film as well, without that it may possibly have been as laughable as people are saying.The village is, and I am saying this without feeling the slightest bit of shame, really creepy. The lack of gore and the fact that we are given only sneaky peeks of scary things makes it frightening. It would not be at all scary if we'd been shown even the slightest amount more gore/scary stuff.The film is about a newly formed village of people kept inside the boundaries through blind fear of ""those we don't speak of"". No wonder nobody speaks of them, they're HORRIBLE! They are honestly really messed up, if I thought they existed I'd soil my pants too. I know that, after a while, as the mini society progressed, people would begin to question and become more and more curious about the towns outside of this little village, especially since the towns seem so much more developed, but it works because the village has only just been formed. Everyone, except for the elders, was raised there and accepts that way of life because they know of no other. They don't really have time to think about what might be better, they're too busy worrying about whether they're wearing the ""safe color"" or not and making sure that they have no trace of the ""bad color"" on or around them.This film leaves you with a lot to think about and judge on a moral or even a ""there are holes in this narrative"" kind of way, although I kind of like the way that this narrative reveals itself. If you're nit picky or you try to work things out as every second of the film is unveiled before your eyes, please don't bother, you'll only complain. Enjoy as a passive audience member, not a connoisseur. Just make sure you see it when the 12-15 year old kids are tucked up in bed or your enjoyment may be spoiled by screaming girls.",The Village
763,danielspiano,Enthralled!,10,10 March 2019,"Underrated! This older hidden ruby is sort of an uplifting oasis in an abundance of cliche, emotionless, and predictable films. It grabs the soul and intrigues the spirit. Both dark and brilliant, all from different angles. The characters and actors blend together to create a surreal, stunning, and tantalizing struggle of humanity. It speaks so deeply that it's simple messages send an AED spark to a cold, dull heart. The filmography is absolutely magnificent during parts, as well as the soundtrack! Not terrifying, but still mischievously enthralling. Don't miss it.",The Village
764,internetsvenmara,From Academy Award nominees...,8,23 February 2005,"Its a sort of a ""new story"" for suspense movie... I like it but i expect a lot of shocking scenes but unfortunately their isn't. But a good works, inspite of my expectation the movie done well... A quite dull moment i experienced....I really like the performance of Bryce Dallas Howard which actually a new comer... I also expect Sigourney's acting ability should seen.From the Academy Award-nominated writer, director and modern-day master of suspense M. Night Shyamalan (Nominee: Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, ""The Sixth Sense"". 1999), THE VILLAGE is a riveting, edge-of-your-seat chiller with a stellar ensemble cast! As his isolated, tight-knit community lives in mortal fear of an oppressive evil inhabiting the forbidden woods just beyond their tiny village, one determined man (Joaquin Phoenix) dares to boldly step into the unknown and confront the astonishing truth!",The Village
765,obrien-aaron-515-200389,Well acted and beautifully filmed.,8,1 June 2013,"The Village tells the story of a large clan of people who live in an enclosed Village (Duh), The Village is surrounded by a forest. In this forest lives ""Those we shall not speak of"", I'll call them creatures from now on. The Village people have an assortment of rules to keep themselves safe from the creatures. Don't let the bad color be seen. It attracts them. - Never enter the woods. That is where they wait - Heed the warning bell, for they are coming. They have these rules because they organized an agreement with them, they stay out of the woods, they won't harm them, but if they go into the woods, they're will be consequences. But a man named Luscious walks into the woods, the creatures decide to unleash these consequences on The Villagers, and now we have The Village. Now The Village is often regarded as Shyamalans first bad film, it's been accused of false marketing, a dumb plot and a disappointing plot twist. First of all, I don't think it's fair to downgrade a film because of false marketing, I personally don't remember the marketing for The Village, but it's wrong to accuse it of something out of the directors hands.Secondly, this is a bit subjective, but I thought that one of the best things about The Village was it's interesting story. It's original and compelling throughout the film.Lastly, the plot twist. It is undeniably not very good at all, it's horribly unveiled in the film, it's not very thought provoking, it's kind of dumb too. I'm sure there was plenty of other ways Shyamalan could of went with it, he could of even avoided a twist and I would have been fine, but it happened and it wasn't very good. My problem is that people are completely attacking the movie just because of the plot twist, of course it isn't good at all, but think about how good it was before the twist was unveiled.Now, I'm giving The Village a 8 out of 10 because of how much I loved the first hour and a bit of the film, it certainly would of got a 9 or 10 if it wasn't for the twist, but sure what can you do. What I loved so much about The Village was the syrup thick atmosphere throughout the film, you could almost feel the mystery of The Village in the air. This atmosphere is established by the beautiful score which I'm glad was praised by most an nominated for an academy award, and the riveting performances.The performances in The Village are some of the best I've seen in a while, especially that of Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy), she stole every scene she was in. Joaquin Phoenix (Lucius)& Adrien Brody (Noah) are both also very good, they completely owned there characters. Everyone in the film is great, but those three were the standouts. The setting of the film is very picturesque, and the beautiful cinematography really brought it out. The script is also something that was very stick out for me, the dialogue between Lucius and Ivy was just so well written, not to say that the rest isn't but it's definitely something worth mentioning. I am disappointed that The Village does suffer from the horrible plot twist, which is a shame.",The Village
766,the_king17,"Well directed at first sight, brilliant when examined.",7,22 August 2004,"This motion picture begins with Mr. Nicholson burying his son, after which the viewer is taken to the ceremonial dinner. As strange sounds come from the woods, only one person, the stupid, gets excited. Then skinned animals being are found. They are firstly said to be killed by coyotes. And that 'those we don't speak of', who keep the villagers from going in the woods surrounding the village, didn't go angry on them. However, some youngsters want to go through the woods to get medicines in towns nearby.Many, many mysteries live in this remote, 19th century village. Red being the forbidden color and yellow the protective color is one of them. What exactly keeps the villagers from going through the woods is another. As are the skinners, and the colors the blind girl actually can see. And of course, the whole 'why' the village is there. Two young men seem to know things. One of them, the stupid, doesn't really care. The other, Lucius, still has to figure out a lot, but he obviously suspects things. But he gets silenced in an attempt of murder. Piece-by-piece the viewer is fed solutions, but he/she is not always given a clear picture. ----- This thriller/detective is chronological and uses few flash-backs to illustrate some monologues of characters. The director attempts to build up the thrill by various means: well utilized sounds, nice cam-work and editing (e.g. as Ivy stands in the door waiting for Lucius, or, as Ivy runs into the barrier), and slow and slightly static but splendidly teasing plot.As in a good thriller/detective the viewer is offered fake solutions, e.g. at some moment it is said 'those we don't speak of' are not real, but in a later scene we actually see one of them in the woods.The theme is the distancy of the village. The viewer must find out why. The motives are: fear (of the outside world), supernaturalness (the view of blind Ivy), knowledge (who are 'those we don't speak of'), red (bad color), yellow (good color), innocence (of the villagers), secrets ( 'sometimes we don't do things we want to do so that others won't know we want to do them'), 'Lucius' (Lat., 'lux', light; as in he sees what others don't), 'Noah' (Hebr. 'rest' / wanderer, as in he wanders where others don't, he's locked up at some point ""Lord shut him in"" (Gen.7:16). This name is a bit fague, but as is the character), the innocent 19th century (one can read '1840' on a gravestone in the opening scene)Main characters: Lucius, seems a distant man at first but turns out to be close to Ivy; Ivy, blind but she can see aura's, she's afraid but she withstands her fear and eventually outsmarts her fear; Noah, he's retarded but that wouldn't justify his stunning actions; Mr. Walker, father of Ivy, head of village, he knows it all, at first he's not willing to sacrifice his secrets but when he does, it turns out not to harm them. The characters are round, they have true emotions and they develop them as the movie progresses.------ Concluding, this tribute to innocence in combination with deep mystery and although having a slightly simple plot it's a worthy thriller. However I would agree with ""cozzymo2"". The movie would've been even better when the big revelation was postponed. The viewer should not know the truth until it's almost too late. Personal grade: 7/10",The Village
767,gm-stratford,Beautiful complexity.,8,29 September 2004,"I am a self confessed Shyamalan fan. His story telling and directing are by far the best we've seen from a director in the past decade. The Village follows his magnificent 2002 film SIGNS, and like SIGNS, The Village is a 'Love it' or 'Hate it' film. As far as I'm concerned, everyone is entitled to their opinion and I'm obviously willing to accept that some people don't like it, but the people who dismiss it as complete rubbish are Simply not intelligent enough to cope with its beautiful complexity.It is the late 1800's and deep, in the countryside, a group of settlers have set-up home in a makeshift village to get away from the hectic life of 'the towns'. The Village is surrounded on all sides by Forest. The community 'council' so to speak, named 'The Elders' are in charge of The Village and have discovered that the surrounding woods are filled with Mystical red-hooded creatures. Those who enter, do not return. Entering the forest is strictly forbidden to all residents of the village, but when it seems that the truce between the creatures and the villagers is ending, one man chooses to challenge the beliefs and enter the woods.Joaquin Pheonix is that said man. He is one of my favourite actors and his skill at portraying his characters does not wain in this film. Bryce Dallas Howard plays a blind villager whom Joaquins character Lucius is in love with. He takes it upon himself to protect her at all costs.Unlike SIGNS, THE VILLAGE is a lot more slowly paced as its story, as i have said, is rather complex and demands a lot of attention and therefore 'screentime'. When the horror does pop its head up, its horror of the greatest magnitude. The glimpses of 'the creatures' are really chilling and leaves the viewer very very nervous, like when your just waiting for a loud crash to break the silence and some sort of attack! I wont spoil it for non viewers but the creature design is brilliant and later in the film when we are treated to a full frontal of the creature with its head hidden in the darkness of its hood, i was genuinely frightened! Its as close as Psychological horror has got to making the viewer close his/her eyes and turn away in the same way as violent horror makes squirmish people do.As for the 'TWIST', well that would be telling wouldn't it! Its the biggest best Shyamalan twist since The Sixth Sense and it really will leave you gobsmacked.....followed by huge discussions about its consequences with friends. I found myself feeling deeply sorrow for a particular character at the end, but you'll have to see it to understand what i mean.The Village is classic Shyamalan but with the emphasis on the story. Its how 'Horror' should be done and its another reason for me to follow his future works. Maybe you'll love it, and maybe you'll hate it, but you HAVE to see it!",The Village
768,loismustdie125,"Finally, a movie that actually engages some thought!",9,16 September 2004,"Though I can understand why some did not like this film, I must say that I saw it four days ago and I am still contemplating the depth of this movie. Shyamalan is the only director in that last few years that makes me think about what I am seeing. Most popular movies today are so ""in-your-face"" obvious and vapid that I find myself reliving the same movie experience continuously. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Yes, I can obviously see the similar Hitchcock styling, but I believe Shyamalan is the only one to pull it off. Because of the great success of ""The Sixth Sense,"" this director has been pigeon-holed and no one wants to see him make anything else because they all expect the same type of movie. I am excited that a director in today's market can venture from his/her safe comfort zone. If for nothing more, see this film for the thought provoking characters, the excellent acting, and the haunting cinematography.",The Village
769,Veritas_Lux_Mea,The Village...a love story,5,12 January 2005,"It should come as no surprise that this film was marketed as a horror film. That is after all what Mr. Shyamalan is known for and what they figure will sell the most tickets. The fact is the film is a love story. I think this is why many people were let down by the film. They were expecting a Sixth Sense or Signs type of film but what they get, in fact, is something very different.As I watched the special features on the DVD I realized that Mr. Shyamalan may have started writing a spooky horror yarn but then got sucked in by the characters he was creating and took more of an interest in them than the goblins.Basically, if this film were marketed with a bit more honesty more people may have enjoyed it. I would say this is not a film for fans of Night's past work but more a film for a broader audience.To me, what I think Night does in this film is explore a little deeper parts of the Rev. Graham Hess character from Signs. As a progression for the filmmaker I think this makes perfect sense. In this film it's more about the characters than the supernatural. Love is this films central theme and in case you miss that point the characters are given several lines to drive this point home.Perhaps that is the real twist of this film, that it's a film made by M. Night Shyamalan that's not like the other films he's made. He's made a love story this time and seemed to put a great deal of care into creating it.The actors all do a fine job and it is quite a cast. Hurt, Gleeson, and Weaver are fantastic, as are the often mentioned Howard and Phoenix. Brody also does well with his role. Just the cast alone was enough to get me interested in seeing this and I'm not a fan of Mr. Shyamalan's work.Overall I found the film to be interesting and well made. It's not a great film, having sort of tried to be two things at once and failing at both, but it is a good entertainment. The secrets of the film are not kept well hidden and I believe most people will sort out what's going on early on but I think that is what the director intends. He is a director of big popular entertainments, in the same way that guy who made ET and Jaws is. So, the films message will always be hammered home and made quite obvious. He does succeed in entertaining I think.Watch this film expecting a love story and I think you may enjoy the ride. Watch it expecting a horror film and you may fall asleep halfway through.If I were ranking it on a star system with no stars being the worst and four stars being the best...I'd give this film 2 stars.My IMDb vote for this film is a 5.",The Village
770,RaidenReviews,A colonial village surrounded by a forest inhabited by mysterious creatures is put in danger.,8,13 February 2014,"This is a very intriguing film that really gets your mind working. Any film that gets your mind working is a good film, hands down. If you are a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's work then you will greatly appreciate this film. The cinematography is really well thought out and it gives the film the daunting aura it portrays. The film sets around a colonial village surrounded by a massive forest. This forest is supposedly inhabited by creatures who have a truce with the villagers not to interfere with the borders that separate them. When a fearless villager named Lucius decides to cross the boundaries in search of 'other towns', the village's safety is put at stake. The most gripping part of this film is the haunting, secretive, mysterious allure that surrounds it. The film's eerie cinematography and a chilling score pieced together by James Newton Howard ( Nominated for an Academy Award) is the core of the movie. The acting in this film considering the brilliant cast of Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt was not the best. So in terms of acting performances, this is not one of the film's strong points. The film's foggy storyline which gets darker and darker as the movie progresses is the key factor of the film to follow.",The Village
771,efrain-2,The biggest disappointment of 2004!,1,28 January 2005,"Ever since the the success of his only good movie, The Sixth Sense, everyone, including the media and himself, seem to think of M. Night Shyamalan as the next Alfred Hitchcock. If this is so, he's got a very long way to go...The Village plays like it was made by an absolute sell out of M. Night's early work. Don't get me wrong, he can still utilize bits of suspense when he wants to -- but suspense is supposed to lead to something, which in the case of his last three films, has been a true disappointment. Furthermore, if he is to be the next Hitchcock, he's got to learn that one big suspenseful twist per movie will not make him the new ""Master of Suspense."" He'll need to approach his films with the notion that the entire film he's creating needs to be suspenseful and mysterious to fill Alfred Hitchcock's shoes.M. Night shows a lot of potential, and I'm convinced he can do so much better, and trying to be original is not a bad thing. But, when trying to be different is the main factor between making a good movie and a bad one, maybe simplicity isn't a bad thing.Perhaps The Village would not have left such a sour taste in my mouth if it weren't billed as a Mystery/Suspense movie. The last half of the movie plays like a family movie, and the ""big twist"" became apparent one third of the way through. Furthermore, the advertising campaigns, the very misleading Sci-fi channel special (similar to the Blair Witch Project's special a couple of years back), and even blatant lies from the parties involved when in a magazine interview, it was stated that this movie was not a Science fiction movie (like Signs), but rather a genuinely scary movie, with actual creatures in it (they even verified more than one creature) gave the notion that this was a very different movie from the finished project. I truly felt mislead when I saw this film, and I hadn't felt this cheated and insulted since the Blair Witch Project.Having seen it a second time, I don't think this was a bad movie. Had it been billed as the Disney movie of the week, I might not have even minded it. However, because of its misleading marketing campaigns, and it's weak and not so very thought out plot, I still find it to be the biggest disappointment of 2004.",The Village
772,Deshwar_Khan,Lame !,4,7 March 2005,"I must say Shyamalan is a great movie maker. He, no doubt, brings the best out of the actors, actresses, the camera and the atmosphere. But, what makes this movie a sub-standard outcome is the fact that Shaymalan is trying too hard to give that 'Shyamalan' touch. It seems like he had the touch planned out in advance, but couldn't find a suitable story and he finally settled on this lame story to deliver that touch. I think Shyamalan should try and grow out of the 'Sixth Sense' shadow. He should not waste any more of his movie-making talents on the 'Shyamalan' puzzle which found success through 'Sixth Sense'. His later movies make me wonder if Bruce Willis should have actually gotten the full credit for Sixth Sense. It is very clear that with every movie that he tries to deliver that touch through, he is losing even more. The audience is fast losing interest in his tricks too.Like Steven Spielberg did, may be Shyamalan should try out diverse ideas to better utilize his talents. That will probably keep the audience interested too.",The Village

Also compared to any other scary stories we have nowawadays it is great. The tension literally never lets up from the credits which Shyamalan always makes intense, to the end. The love story between Lucius and Ivy is very good and adds even more tension on top. The scariness is all through it as we constantly hear the noises from the creatures and when they finally do enter the Village it is a scary scene that I will not soon forget. This movie is very emotional as well and every single actor plays their part perfectly. This movie is a definite must see for anyone who likes scary movies.",The Village

Night Shyamalan film, this was disappointing.On a brighter note, the plot was creepy and when someone entered the woods, the sound effects and whatnot were very scary. And when you only see that little bit of the monsters, they were also scary. However, when you see the full Monte of them, they look like something taken from Power Rangers. I half expected them to grow gigantic and shoot eye beams at the village. And while the plot was creepy, it was overall weak and in some cases pointless.

The twist happy director who has brought us many interesting features such as 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs'. All with unexpected endings, these films make us look at the director and think ""What will he do next?"" So when I heard about another Shyamalan film that involves mythical creatures I was thrilled. Until I saw it. What started out as a good thriller/drama was just ruined by its unexpected but disappointing ending. All viewers who are sick of spoilers, please look away. The fact that the creatures aren't even real just angered me mainly due to the fact that I have wasted over an hour just to see what was hidden under those red cloaks.

A movie as bad as Revenge of the killer tomatoes was funny even though it was awful. This waste of time presumes to be a great work of suspense and ends up being a great let down.It is sad to see such good actors wasted on a movie with such a bad script.

780,sameer71,What if the Creatures were real? (Some Spoilers),10,14 January 2006,"What is up with this movie? Honestly? I did like the plot and the sudden twists in the tale, but Shyamalan's movie's are a bit too over the twists and tingles. I liked The Sixth Sense because they had REAL ghosts and I also liked Signs because there was REAL aliens but fake things like ""Mythical Creatures"" in The Village just doesn't please me, so I ask myself, what if the creatures were real? Here is some pointers of what would've happened: ~Creatures are too stupid to own there own property. I mean, do you see Bambi fighting over the woods? Know what I mean...~The Elders would've known about it and had never moved into the village.~There would be attacks every night or day because when you get hungry, you have to eat like every two or three times a day but the people only feed them once a day. Many people would be dying if they were real.~'Those We Don't Speak Of' would be a darn rumor in the village because c'Mon, If I had creepy creatures staying outside my neighborhood I would definitely talk about it, right? I can't just keep quiet and go on with my life with the fact that blood-thirsty, jaw breaking, terribly frightening creatures being my neighbor.~Creatures or animals aren't attracted to any color unless retarded or mentally ill.~Finally, The Government would've done something about it already if someone was attacked or hurt by the creatures.

It's a wholly original film that grips you right out of the gate, rife with symbolism and the anxieties that lie deep within all of us.

But what did I find? A brooding, meaningless, fillibuster of a mess. There isn't really even an implied horror. Some of the decent horror films at least implied there would be something about to happen. But this movie managed to lack even the slightest amount of suspense. This was a period piece where a bunch of obviously bored looking actors spoke ad nauseum about the possibility of the potential that something might happen if one ventured into the woods...One really couldn't care about the characters.

783,Chris-169,Ugh.,4,30 July 2004,"This movie was extremely disappointing.The ads made it look like a scary, thrilling movie. It was not. M Night's past movies made us think it would have a surprise ending that was interesting and made sense. It did not.The sad thing is that the twist wasn't even really a twist, since it was so disgustingly apparent from the first frame that I didn't understand how anyone even considered it a surprise. Sad. Really, truly sad.Up through a point (until I saw the creatures on-screen for the first time), it was a spooky movie. Anyone who saw both this and Dark Crystal will know where the problem lies.Out of all of his movies, this was by far the worst. It was slow. It was plodding. And, for a movie that from the previews seemed intent on being a thriller, those two are instant death.  (And for those who say ""you just don't understand slow movies"", two of my favorite films are The Others and Braveheart, both of which are much slower than this one -- but MUCH better executed).It wasn't a horrible movie, but it wasn't good by any stretch of the imagination. I did my best to give it a fair score (a '4') and not give it an instant '1' just to counterbalance the 10 that most people seem to be hurling at it (which is surprising since even the biggest fans of M Night's can't consider this a 'perfect' film). The movie should have instilled fear, but what I got was a big steaming pile of ""That was IT?!?""",The Village
784,filmaven,Great Film,8,14 March 2005,"I usually agree with Ebert about 98% of the time, but he is dead wrong here. I seem to be out of synch with EVERYONE on M. Night films, which I love, see in theaters and buy as soon as released on DVD - I can't say that for any other modern director. I thought The 6th Sense was his least effective film. I found it very conventional in Hollywood terms in many respects, and I saw through its conceit in minutes. Shyamalan's films have grown progressively stronger since. Many have criticized Shyamalan for an alleged lack of reality in his films, e.g., the ""Achilles heel"" of the alien creatures in signs; but as in this film, I believe those critics have missed the point and architecture of Shyamalan movies. M. Night poses for the viewer an internally consistent set of rules - like in comics, the rules may be (somewhat) implausible in real life, but he does not cheat on them once set (Many of Hitchcock's films require you to suspend disbelief, not to mention the Twilight Zone, Star Trek, most comic books, etc.) The viewer's sense of reality and the set up for the twist arises from the emotional truth of the characters, and therefore depends heavily on the acting abilities of the cast (probably why I was not fooled by The 6th Sense - somehow Bruce Willis tipped his hand to me, perhaps because it was hard for me to buy him as such a passive character - unless there was some physical reason he could not effect change in his life).I note that everyone seems to acknowledge how scared/creeped out they were by the movie, but then disappointed when the twist was revealed. Does that make the earlier fear any less palpable or real when experienced? Do you still believe in the bogeyman? Or do you deny that you had a night light when you were a tot? CGI does not make the monster any more real - it is all just light pictures on a screen.I think that as a culture, many are predisposed to reject the innocence of The Village's characters; we have lost so much innocence in our society, that those from a more innocent place seem almost like another species rather than another time or culture - we need others to be as corrupt as we are in order to justify our own corruption. Part of my childhood was spent on a farm in the rural south; and the secrets and lies (incl. religion, to which M. Night alludes but does not state, but in the current political clime wisely sidesteps confronting it) employed by elders to ""protect"" the younger generation and maintain social control rang particularly true for me. Also the theme that even in a utopia, the darker side of human nature will out, even in the most seemingly innocent creatures (Caliban?). The Village is by no means perfect, but there is deep emotional truth in this film. In support thereof, there are also astonishing performances, esp. by the young lady, Bryce Dallas Howard (Saints be praised that Kirsten Dunst was otherwise occupied). I deeply hope M. Night stays true to his vision and continues to make ""horror"" films about the human condition.",The Village
785,Mazdoor,Best Movie So Far This Year,9,15 August 2004,"My wife and I saw this movie last night and both thought it was the best movie we've seen thus far this year, an excellent effort by Mr. Shyamalan.  A few minor nitpicks regarding potential plot holes that don't affect the overall tenor and focus of the movie.  Beautifully directed, cinemetographed (if that's a word) and generally commendable acting.  While Ms. Howard was good, I must complain that she didn't come across as a blind person very well -- her eyes seemed to focus on whatever she was ""looking"" at.  But then, I'm not an expert on blindness.The marketing for this movie seems to have been in some ways an advantage and in more ways a drawback leading to disappointment.  My advice if you do want to see this movie: (1) don't read any more reviews on this board because some of them give too much away; and (2) don't go in expecting anything -- try to have a clean slate with respect to your notions of what this movie will be.",The Village
786,Dedort,The beginning's good. The end isn't.,5,3 September 2004,"This film begins interestingly, but after a succession of hopelessly contrived revelations becomes laughable.  From the opening scenes, it is clear that there is something strange going on in this idyllic 19th century hamlet surrounded by woodland. The occupants appear so carefree, and yet... A nice sense of unease develops as we are made aware of their weird taboos. There is a ""bad"" colour, there are ""those whe do not speak of"". It becomes clear that there is something in the woods that poses a terrible danger to the inhabitants. The horror that stalks this place can only be seen from the corner of your eye, and can only be described indirectly. This makes for a genuinely unsettling first half.The film looks fine, and the music is effective in underscoring the sense of gathering menace. Furthermore, the performances are all really quite good, from the fearless Lucius (Pheonix), through the sweet but steely Ivy (Howard) to some of the more potato-faced village elders, who watch over their flock with a convincing mix of the autocratic and the benevolent.The increase in the unsettling activities of the mysterious creatures is handled well, and is accompanied by engaging human drama when a love-triangle begins to clarify. I was really looking forward to where the film was going to go next. Unfortunately, it gets very silly. Very silly indeed. Yes, we're talking the dreaded twist(s). Whether you see them coming or not, they don't develop the story in an interesting direction. They are lumpen and silly, and seemed utterly contrived. I imagine this was in an attempt to do a Sixth-Sense yet again and get the audience ""ooh!""-ing. I'm ashamed to admit it, but I couldn't stifle a snigger. The final twist that accompanies the opening of the mysterious box may as well have been that the events were all a dream, and is just as inconsequential. That having been said, it is rather amusing, (I guess intentionally so) when Shyamalan pops up to helpfully explain away an obvious gap in the logic at the end. But that isn't anything like adequate compensation for the second half of the film. I felt particularly robbed because I had really started to enjoy it.I don't mind if he makes another film, because ""The Village"" is clearly the work of a talented man. But please, can the twist next time be that there isn't a twist?",The Village
787,mlazic,As British say Perfectly Awful,1,27 August 2004,"I think this is easily the worst film of the year.What a waste of resouces, actors and moviegoers time.The screenplay must have been written by a school dropout and the idea of a search for paradise is so poorly presented that I can only merit this film 1 on a scale of 10. Why some actors agree to appear in such a stinker is beyond me.It only shows that after a successful film like Sixth Sense, a director needs to really work on the story before filming it.For me the silliest point are the clothing of the villagers - they cannot go out of their confine, yet they are all immaculately dressed.Dialogue is sometimes so silly that one wonders how on earth director thought of it.Nice camera-work though.",The Village
788,caj-5,New American Master of Suspense,8,8 August 2004,"I now officially love M. Night Shyamalan ... or at least I love his films. In these days of cat scares, cliche gore, action thrillers, and hyper-ironic post-modern fear factors, it seems that Shyamalan is one of the few people who is experimenting with Suspense and Suspense as vehicle to tell interesting stories.If you liked _The Sixth Sense_ and _Unbreakable_, know that this is a different kind of movie.  There is no ""big twist"" at the end.  This isn't a film where you won't be able to at least have a guess at what's going on. That's not it's point.  The joy in this film is in watching how events unfold and how these characters act and interact.  Their primal struggle is internal, conveniently externalized for us by the mysterious threat that forces them to fight their more personal demons.  This is a film about our loved ones, what we do when we develop them, what we do to protect them, and what we do when we lose them.  (Listen for Hurt's line about love that ends a scene you've been building up to for awhile.)It's beautifully shot.  It's well-crafted.  It has several exciting performances played with great honesty in a ""close to the chest"" intensity that captures a reserved people placed under pressure.  That's a style that Shyamalan likes for his films, and here I find it succeeding the most so far.It's too early yet to start talking about him as the modern day Hitchcock, but I sure can't wait for this filmmaker's next film.",The Village
789,scipwraec,Ridiculous.,2,21 January 2005,"Up until this movie, I had been impressed by Shymalan's work and thought each of his films was an improvement over the last. 'The Sixth Sense', 'Unbreakable', and 'Signs' were intelligent movies, intriguing and original, the sort of intricate movies that demand to be watched a second time so that audiences can catch what they might have missed. I was very disappointed with 'The Village'. It had potential, but the few good, suspenseful moments were never enough to save the film, only enough to make me wish there had been a few major rewrites. The cast should have been brilliant, yet those of us watching were laughing so much during the first half at the horribly silly dialogue (coyotes, indeed) that it was difficult to take the characters seriously when the story took a darker turn.This was a movie full of itself, trying to pass for atmospheric and clever and chilling. Give it a miss and go back to 'Signs'; remember that Shymalan has given us good entertainment before, and have hope that he will do so again with his next film.",The Village
790,joekm-1,Unconventionaly Entertaining,9,22 July 2006,"One of my favorite movies ever. THis film has all the credentials of a classic. Scene after scene i found myself feeling and caring for each and every character. The emotional impact was astounding. We can all relate to virtually any character in the novel, which only makes the film that much better.THis was a great story from beginning to end. I never knew what would happen. Strangely enough, the neo-classical score was fantastic. WIthout the music the movie would not have been the same. I'll admit, i even bought the soundtrack! While this is one of my favorites i can see why some people didn't like it at all. It wasn't a conventional film by any means. No standard plot or obvious themes. You really have to dig deep to appreciate it (something many aren't willing to do). It takes awhile for the plot to get moving so many people will loose interest before it gets exciting.This film is a testament to M. Night's flexibility as a filmmaker. NO matter what kind of story he is telling, he always has me in the palm of his hand. Its amazing what one man can do with a lot of spare time and a camera. Spend the money, buy the movie... You wont be disappointed.",The Village

Of course I was alone on the way out ....people felt lied to overall not allowing them to see and enjoy the nuances. I have come to watch this movie over and over making it my favorite for many reasons........this movie is about love duty sacrifice and bravery.................need i say more...not monsters or a twist. The cast is proof that the script is powerful......the style is vintage m night....then comes the wonderful acting and scenery and simple, timeless msgs i could go on all NIGHT!

792,christbasher,Horror version of the Truman show,1,5 January 2005,"From the beginning, the character, setting of the movie, the mystery surrounding the village, and the monster were very interesting and believable, but the ending just made it absolutely meaningless and idiotic.I think anyone wanting to watch this movie must be told of this most idiotic ending so that they can decide if they want to waste hour and a half on this movie.I believe if the audience finds out at the end that the village was surrounded by alien civilizations in some faraway planet would have made much more sense.However, the one big question is WHAT ABOUT THE AIRPLANES??????????????????????",The Village

Shyamalan creates a world that I can't get out of my mind.  I know that I will have to go back to the theatre to see this again. While so many films rely on one-liners, cheap tricks, or formula comedy; Shyamalan is able to create a completely unique world that is like experiencing a parallel universe.  If you are tired of the same old movie experience and want to find something totally new, I highly recommend this film. This is his best film since Sixth Sense. I can't understand why there is so much dislike of this work.  Maybe the steady diet of reality television is causing movie-goers to totally miss a totally fantastic story.  I know The Village will eventually be a dvd that I watch again and again.",The Village
794,redlohkrub,Another tribute to Air America and Stuart Smalley,1,31 July 2005,"The plot was slow and mediocre on a good day (see: Signs). This is the usual Liberal Mantra of We Know Better Than You. Any of the feeble characters involved in this dogma could have joined a commune or Amish settlement. Instead they remove any choice their offspring might of had. Why? Mindlessly doing as your told is the corner stone of the ACLU, dictators and liberals. As long is it is what they tell you. I was terribly disappointed in Weaver doing this movie. After ""Death and the Maiden (1994)"", a terrific drama and ""Galaxy Quest (1999)"", an amazing comedy and spoof of Sci-Fi, to lower herself to drivel like this, Shame, Shame, Shame. Well even the best can have a bad day. Lets all hope for no more as bad as this one was. Not surprised to see Holden. My only regrets about this movie is the two hours of my life I will never get back, the $1.50 I spent to see it at the theater and that IMDb reviews do not go to zero or lower.",The Village
795,penno,Rather odd...,6,7 September 2004,"Well as I walked out of the cinema I wasn't even sure *what* I'd seen. The movie trailer (much as I try and avoid them - they just give away so much) made me think this was going to be some kind of struggle between the nice village people, and the nasty monsters from ""the woods"".It wasn't that at all. Bear that in mind before you see it, and I think you'll fare well. It's not a bad movie. It's got a very tight and flowing storyline. Very well written. Very well produced. I got quite wrapped up in it to be honest. The conclusion is very fast, and there seems to be an awful lot going on. I liked the way the director crammed all that in in the concluding parts, without making it seem *too* fast.If you were going in ""cold"" - ie without knowing a THING about the movie, I think it would have quite an impact. For me, I thought it was above average. Worth seeing.",The Village
796,taylor-chicklin,Very misjudged and under appreciated,9,5 April 2015,"""The Village"" may not be as high up there as Shyamalan's ""The Sixth Sense"", but I still see it as being one of his best. That being said, don't let the trailers fool you. The miss marketing of the film is one of the biggest reasons this film did so poorly. The trailers make The Village out be be horror/monster movie, so naturally people went into the theatres expecting a scary thriller of some kind. What nobody realized was that it was actually romantic drama piece in hiding. There are dark psychological elements which drive the story along however, but it's only a frame as the main focus is on the relationship of the characters, as well as the enigmatic mystery that lies just beyond the borders of the village. Granted the twist at the end isn't the most jaw dropping, but it's still intriguing and adds another layer to the story. The acting is incredible! Bryce Howard Dallas as Ivy Walker is still one of my favorite performances today, as well as Adrien Brody as Noah. The visuals are as well hauntingly beautiful. Over all, this is a very under appreciated film, but if you're going in expecting a horror/thriller be prepared to be disappointed. The Village is a romantic drama piece with elements of dark psychological themes. It's a film I recommend to check out!",The Village
797,abepaulx,"Stop complaining, good acting is rare so enjoy it.",9,11 August 2004,"The thing about Night Shyamalan is that he provides the story, the atmosphere and he lets his cast do the talking. Which is where the problem is because it all works too well. His cast are left to their own devices and they become totally absorbed in their roles and give such life to the parts, that it all becomes a letdown at the end (to some) when you realize the material they had to work with was just average at best.I knew the ending and I heard all the criticism but I still enjoyed The village. I did not feel cheated nor did I feel insulted as so many claim they were. If there was any fault to be found, I would say that Mr Shyamalan has got to stop appearing in his own movies, Sigourney Weaver's oylde English delivering was terribly wooden and a blind girl could not have gone as far as she did... but at that point you're pretty caught up, you want to see how it all turns out. Also, that's when all the explanations are forthcoming. All in all, I look forward to the next Night Shyamalan flick.",The Village
798,pintsizeX,I loved it,10,1 August 2004,"(Keep in mind I am a HUGE M.KNight fan...)I really think his work is brilliant. This film really reminds me of something that a 15 year old film kid would make with his friends if he was given a large budget and good actors. I say this as a very big compliment- it's a film that makes your heart race with the addition of some cheesy parts that scare you quickly and then make you laugh at yourself for being so scared. This combo makes going to the film extremely fun.The best part about this movie is not even what goes on during the film. It's what people are saying afterward. Everyone asks ""what is it about?"" and you can't say anything because it will give it all away. You can barely answer ANY questions about it because every question leads to comething else. People who have seen it feel as though they know and have seen something no one else has and it just makes you HAVE to go see it.One element that makes his work so different is that he barely uses music. When most movies use music over every dialogue, this film uses silence to convey seriousness and to give an eerie and subtle hint of something terrible brewing.I might be in the minority here but this film was awesome in so many ways. The actors in this film were absolutely fabulous and his character development is really great. There is something special and noticible about every one of his characters. The story might have been simple is something the audience will think aobut much longer after the final credits. I kept thinking about the concept of this movie and wondering ""what if....""

799,antetomasov,A story about love and courage (and some other stuff),8,22 November 2010,"This movie is an another great work from the master director Shaymalan and his partner music composer J.N.Howard who wrote a beautiful music background for this movie. Actors did a great work and the stand out is the female lead Bryce Dallas Howard who plays a beautiful and courageous blind girl. There is a lot of going on in this movie, I liked how you are able to feel the love between Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix). Lucius is the bravest boy in the village and his heart is big, he cares deeply about his friends but more than so he loves Ivy. Ivy is a blind girl, but her spirits are high and she is very kind and beautiful, with a courage that matches that of Lucius. Those two are most likely the brightest stars of the village. Well, the emotions are there for you to feel in this film, there is a tragic mad character that also loves Ivy and he out of selfishness attacks Lucius because he wants Ivy all for himself. This shows the thin line between love and hate, at the end the madman is all alone and instead of getting Ivy all for himself, she of course leaves him forever and he is left in his own personal hell. The one thing I would change is, when Ivy is in the forest she encounters one of the monsters and tricks the monster to fall into a pit. Owned by a blind girl, oh yeah! But I would keep that to be the actual monster because in the movie, the monster turns out to be the tragic madman that wanted Ivy for himself dressed as a monster. I would keep it a mystery because there is a legend that the strange creatures inhabit the forest after all. That would make Ivy's victory more complete in my eyes. That is the only thing I would change. This leaves the question of - what about the retard that stabbed Lucius then? Well he would most likely be kept locked inside his home for the rest of his life, so I don't know, it is f... up to kill him, but also it is f... up to support this asshole for the rest of your life. I guess an accidental death is a good solution for this character. And finally near the end of the movie, Ivy encounters a kind young man form the ""towns"". He is more of an exception to the rule because an average guy probably wouldn't be eager to help Ivy as this guy was. We see the average type guy a moment later, he is played by Shaymalan himself, that guy advises the kind guy not to talk with people while they are on the job. For a moment I was afraid the kind guy will listen to the asshole guy and not help Ivy. Thankfully that doesn't happen. So the message of the movie is? In our modern world we lack the connection between people that people have in the village, but we have technology to make our lives better (medicine). So maybe that kind guy was an example of how we need to be in our modern world, have some humanity and innocence and technology at the same time. Also, Ivy's younger sister was funny, she wanted to be with Lucius also but that was probably just a child like infatuation. Or was it? Childhood lasts for as long as you follow your dreams.",The Village
800,snake-eater-888-495559,A true modern great.,10,9 November 2010,"The Village is an excellent film by M. Night Shyamalan, it focuses on a small community who although seem happy, are living in fear of mysterious creatures in the woods which surround them. 'The Village' is a beautifully made film, it has an engrossing story with detailed characters in a unique setting. The film also has artistic cinematography and like all M. Night films an expertly composed score which suites the film perfectly. This is one of those productions in which every line of dialogue and every camera shot have weight and meaning as well as being a joy to watch. I really cannot say enough good things about this film, it is something I would be happy to watch every day of the week as it demands repeated viewings.

801,insubrian,This movie spoofs itself,1,3 May 2014,"OK. So there are these disturbed people who, to escape the pain of loosing a loved one in the real world, and to escape the fear of criminals in the city, move to the woods, create a nature preserve that no one is allowed to enter or even fly over. They sure must have had a lot of money. Can private citizens even control the air space over their property? They could have afforded to get the best psychotherapy instead. They move to the woods where somehow they gain knowledge of how people lived, farmed, dressed, and spoke 200 years ago, and they start living and speaking like that everyday, being very talented actors and essentially becoming the character they play, for the purpose of fooling their OWN CHILDREN that this is the only reality? What kind of parents are these? They want to protect their children, yet they create new monsters and terrorize their own children and grandchildren to hide in the basement? Mutilate animals? Didn't they escape the city out of fear? Why create new fear? Why keep secrets in the ""forbidden shed"" or in forbidden chests? Wouldn't some kid eventually open them? They escape the city for fear of loosing a loved one, yet chose to live without any modern medicine or hospitals? Also, they mark the edge of the woods with 30 foot poles,no fence of any kind, which look like modern telephone poles, watch towers that look like modern forest service towers, they have contained gas lights in town, yet open flames right next to the forest? Wouldn't there be a fire on a windy day? It gets windy there. Who supplies the gas for the street lights? Do women there just have 15-20 kids in their life time or does someone go to town to buy contraception? And what's even more dumb is the guard at the end of the movie. He is a subordinate and apparently he is not in on the scam, yet he allows a blind girl back in the preserve, even gets her a ladder, (it is his job to keep people out), where he knows someone else is seriously injured, and he doesn't tell his boss or the police. Yeah right! The blind girl is selectively blind and can race Noah to the Rock and can find her way in the woods,sent by her own father no less, because ""he made an oath not to go to the towns"" yet she stumbles around her own porch? Essentially these elders are really messed up people who like to play God and control people through fear. Nice Utopia!",The Village
802,mdaltonnyc,A Masterpiece,9,31 July 2004,"The Village is something different in an otherwise boring summer of nonstop sequels and idiotic Will Smith blow 'em up's. It's insightful, intelligent, and a deeply moving portrait on American paranoia and fear of the outside world. Shyamalan seems to dig deeper in each other his films, unearthing humanistic feelings more and more. The Village is his masterpiece and makes The Sixth Sense pale in comparison. The film delivers creepy moments and dreadful situations, but they never over-shadow the film's main ideas of isolation and politic refuge. As great as Signs is, The Village is a punch in the stomach, especially in this day and age of the Bush Administration. Shyamalan could even rival Michael Moore for his truthful views on government paranoia. I loved this movie and on a second viewing, experienced something even scarier than any horror movie could ever show: man's twisted views on his own kind.",The Village
803,fanboy125,"The trouble is, you can see it coming...",4,20 February 2005,"This film promised so much in the trailer, but failed to deliver through no fault of it's own. The problem is M Night Shyamalan - because when you know he is the director, and you have seen his other films, you then spend the whole film waiting to see if the twist is the one you guessed it was. Having said this, if you look at the film separated from its pedigree, then it has some very good areas , such as the sense of isolation and community created within the village. It is beautifully filmed, with many moments of real tension. And the performance of the film must be that of Bryce Dallas Howard, a true star in the making. However, the dialogue I found slow, and stilted. William Hurt was operating on cruise control, and Joaquim Phoenix seems to think that every emotion can be conveyed through the use of a blank glassy stare. So, some good points, but not enough to make up for the way I felt cheated at the end of the movie, and glad I saw this on DVD for a third of the price I would have paid at the cinema.",The Village

But to them I say, how else could he have publicsed it? (Misspelled, I know). This movie was brilliant, the acting was superb (Brody and Howard, one word: Wow.) and the direction was amazing. I think that when people realized they had been duped, they felt silly for being scared and that's another reason they hate this so much. I didn't see the creatures becoming fake, I didn't see Adrien Brody being the creature that chased her, I didn't know they were all in modern times, though I must admit I suspected that. People need to cut M.Night a break. If you go into this movie and spend the whole movie looking and guessing for his spin, you won't enjoy it. You need to go for the ride. If we rode rollercoasters and said, okay, the drop's going to come NOW! No, well...NOW! And you never got the build-up, of course you're going to be let down. Shut up. Stop whining.

805,mareserenitatis,Awesome,10,1 August 2004,"This film is Shyamalan at his best. The twist is totally unexpected and the surprises appear at every turn. The old-school use of sound effects to scare the audience is refreshing. Most so-called ""scary movies"" of our time use gore and violence to scare the movie-goers, but ""The Village"" uses our own imaginations to scare us. The unexpected happens when it is most needed. The plot itself has its weaknesses, but I think that the film comes together very nicely in the end. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a good scare, but without all the bloodiness commonly associated with movies that are meant to scare us. I would not recommend this movie to those who are looking for a deep and meaningful film because this isn't it.

Night Shyamalan's most recent film The Village. The evening my sister, brother and I went to the theatre to see it, we were completely mesmerized--from the moment the music began until the very last credit disappeared from the screen.Many people do not presently appreciate the brilliance of the film, but I believe, in time, more and more will come to realize what a masterpiece it really is. It was made for an intelligent, thinking audience, but was marketed for a grim and gore seeking audience. The unfortunate result was that many of the thinkers avoided seeing it because they aren't usually interested in gore, and the horror fiends hated it because there wasn't any.The film contains breathtaking music and cinematography, and excellent dialogue. The casting and acting is flawless. The characters develop very well throughout, and the storyline is surprisingly fresh and original. The Village belongs with other mystery, thriller, romance, dramas such as Vertigo. M. Night is showing himself to be in the line of Hitchcock, only better--if that's possible.",The Village
807,morpheus84,A thriller with a dash of drama,10,2 November 2004,"I do not understand how anybody cannot commend Shyamalan on his latest venture. The film was vintage Shyamalan, with slow camera work and lingering moments of silence foreboding an atmosphere of doom.I wasn't bored even for a moment as many others have commented because the story gripped me and kept me interested with subliminal moments of dialogue or scenery which we have come to recognise as the trademark of this film-maker.The character of Bryce Dallas Howard(Ivy), the blind, innocent country lass was scripted perfectly albeit a bit too honest... Joaquin Phoenix(Lucius) delivers a flawless performance and we can identify ourselves or at least somebody we know with his unabashed courage or is it curiosity....??? Sigourney Weaver(Alice) as Lucius' mother plays a subdued role and is not the fiery mother we expect her to be.. The dialogue and situations in this film are expertly handled and is a treat for moviegoers, though i have found many who are not impressed with the movie.Perhaps they are satisfied with only fast-paced action flicks and raunchy bedroom scenes...and when an actual story is unfolded brilliantly on the screen, they fail to recognise it.. SPOILER UP AHEAD.............About the twist..Well,i would say that there are basically two twists in this film...the first one is fairly recognisable early on in the film..that there are no ""creatures of the woods"" as such..but the reason for the creation of this myth, to scare the villagers into submission and staying within the boundaries of the village is revealed with the panache and poise of a master craftsman towards the end of the movie... the village is actually created by a group of individuals..""the elders"" to stay away from the evils and violence in modern day society i.e the 21st century.. which has led to tragic losses for the elders when they were a part of mainstream society.For hardcore Shyamalan fans like me, it was a bit of a letdown because of the high emotional content and lesser shock value, but again i was impressed by the cinematography, the editing and the well written script which managed to hold the film together.Hollywood is increasingly turning out formula films at an alarming rate and it is heartening to occasionally see a film that's different and also keeps the viewer coming back for more.Kudos to Shyamalan..We need more scripts from him in the near future to keep us thrilled and shifting in our seats and not just eye-popping graphics in high budget films turning us into mindless zombies.",The Village

There were some frightening parts, and I love being frightened. But the twist didn't pack a big enough punch for me. I'll admit, I never saw the twist(s) coming, but they didn't blow me away. The story follows people that appear to be Amish, they live a very simplistic life in an earlier time. There is something dangerous that lives in the woods beyond their boundaries, and they must burn fires around the village each night to keep the creatures away. When someone gets seriously hurt, a very brave young woman (played by Bryce Howard) volunteers to venture outside the village, something that is NEVER done because of the creatures that live beyond the borders. This is when we learn more about the creatures that live beyond the borders.",The Village
809,thelastfabares,Stale,4,7 August 2004,"This movie was extremely boring and the ending was predictable. I think it is humorous that M. Night keeps making cameos in his movies. Is he stupid? I pity the fool that tries to emulate Hitchcock so obviously. Nobody should consciously try to emulate another. They should let their own abilities speak for themselves.One thing that Hitch didn't do was use so many zoom shots. I found them really distracting in the movie. Use cuts or else hold the shot. Zooms are for home videos.The general concept of the movie is good but it could have been so much better. The dialog for one is terrible. There is great actors here, but they just look silly.Hitch liked making cameos in his movies, but he didn't act in any I've ever seen. M. Night's acting is terrible and just feels thrown in.The director of The Village definitely has talent, but he hasn't shown himself to be very versatile since The Sixth Sense. Also, I hate those promotional hoaxes he's been doing for his movies on TV.All of his movies have been a YAWN and a ""Whatever"" to me.",The Village
810,Fynarra,Beautiful film,10,12 January 2005,"I personally think this is one of M. Night's best yet. This is a stunning movie with a lot of attention spent on the sets and costumes and the background. No one seems to appreciate the kind of time and money it takes to do a period piece--not to mention doing it in a way that can be felt and believed.The biggest complaint I hear is 'I figured it out in the first 20 minutes'. Well--I figured things out very early on, but it didn't spoil it for me in any way, shape, or form. We go to the movies for entertainment--to put a bit of magic back in our lives.Go and close your eyes; let yourself go. I loved the movie both in form and for the beautiful score.",The Village
811,collineliot,A solid film.,10,31 July 2004,"I went into The Village with low expectations. I read some reviews before seeing it, and they all kind of gave me the impression to not expect much. It turns out that The Village has a lot to offer.First, I thought the acting was superb. Howard does a great job, as well as Brody. Howard really stands out in my mind, but everyone else did good, too. Second, Like Sixth Sense and Signs, there were times during the film I was tense waiting for something to happen. I wanted to run and hide or at least not look, but there was no escaping. I love when this happens. This means that I was truly involved in the story line. It takes a good film to do that. Third, The major major twist/surprise really through me off. Looking back, I KNEW that some hints were being given through the dialouge and such, but I was so involved in the film, I didn't notice. Fourth, The major plot points, where the love story is introduced, and where the dramatic conflict is introduced, are excellent. I really feel like this is the best film since Sixth Sense as far as drama goes. (of M. Night's films) They got me so hooked into what the characters are about. This lead to me truly caring about what happens to them. Without this, none of the action matters. Lastly, I think the symbolism and visual story telling add depth to this film. There are people overcoming personal tragedy, there are traps they must not fall in. There are moments in this film, and even a few sequences, that really felt like a what a film should be. No words, just visuals. When you combine all the great aspects of the story with the superb camera and editing work, you have a solid film. There is nothing more powerful in this film than the shot that didn't cut away. There are several, but each one is just so beautiful, even the violent one. I cannot say enough good about this film. My only let down was that I wanted it to go longer, that is, I wanted to more of a resolution, but what I got was more than satisfactory. I'm just a romantic i guess.

813,ndk__,Some nice ideas to think about,7,7 September 2004,"I went to this movie without expecting a copy of The Sixth Sense, which was good because it wasn't.OK, it does bear some similarities - it isn't till the very end that the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the build up of suspense is very slow but steady, and the fairly straightforward story is cleverly narrated.What I liked about this movie, is that it didn't focus on the obvious thrills of Hollywood blockbusters. Yes, I immediately knew there had to be a logical explanation for the creatures in the woods, and still I found myself intrigued by the feelings of fear, the behaviour arising from fear, the way fear had crept into the lives of these people. The existence of the creatures had so effectively scared the s**t out of these people, just the mere story about and odd occurrence of these monsters was enough!In the end, we find out why the creatures are there. Afterwards, I found myself wondering if I would go that far for some peace and quiet, if it is humane to instill fear in others for your own selfish reasons, if it is OK to deprive your offspring of certain aspects of the world. There is a resemblance to religion: people who raise their children with strict religious beliefs, always set out (stern) barriers, thus restricting their view on the world. Is that a good thing? I wonder.",The Village
814,lexie-bl,Better than average,9,14 September 2004,"True to form M Night Shyamalan has made another film with a great twist at the end. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie and got satisfaction out of the suspense throughout. The plot moved along quite quickly and there were enough sub plots to keep viewers guessing. Bryce Dallas Howard was terrific as Ivy. She is a very talented actor and I was extremely impressed with her ability to capture the innocence and passion of a young woman 'of the period'. Adrien Brody was a scene stealer as always and Joaquin Phoenix plays the quiet, unassuming but very earnest young Lucius with commendability. The older generation of actors gave the story enough credibility that the ending, although a surprise, was believable. I would definitely recommend this movie especially if you liked the producers other efforts such as 'Sixth Sense' or 'Signs'.",The Village
815,joshreluctant,One of the best films of the year,6,29 July 2004,"I saw the screening last night for the Village at work. I work at the movie theaters, showcase cinemas. I saw it with a house of about 40 people, mostly teenagers from work (like myself). I even watched Unbreakable today with my film-making partner to prepare myself for the newest M. Night Shyamalan masterpiece. And unlike EVERYONE I saw it with, I loved the movie. The premise was intriguing. Adrien Brody's performance made the movie for me. And I loved the creatures. I loved the story. I loved the twist. But don't get confused, the twist isn't the ending. The ending is a reintroduction to the main points of the film, and after viewing the twist, and the subsequent ending, I'm still in awe, and still trying to fathom some sort of understanding of it. I'll need to see it again, probably a couple more times. But it's definitely a movie worth seeing at least once, even if you don't like Shyamalan's work.",The Village

For the first hour or so, this is a great movie; tense, touching, and magical. However... once we find out the first of many ""twists,"" the viewer just feels stupid for ever having faith in the potential of such a story. It goes back and forth, not deciding on whether it wants to contend for our faith and affection or not, seemingly trying to figure out which direction to go in order to BLOW THE AUDIENCE'S MIND!!! That is this movie's problem; it loses its magic, because it addresses what appear to be every one of M. Night's whims, every twist that he considered, and ends up leaving an incredible void in the viewer's stomach.

Let me start off by saying that I understand why some people are getting upset at the fact that lots of people are bashing this movie and saying that it is stupid, and has no plot because that is not true. However, the movie does not have a plot that would be visible to someone coming in to the movie expecting something totally different. But thats the problem, the previews to this movie had EVERYONE expecting something totally different. Nobody that saw the previews to this movie can deny that they went to the theater with the intentions on seeing a horror movie, and those people, including myself, were disappointed at the fact that we were actually viewing a movie that went a completely different direction. As someone else said about this movie earlier, maybe if I knew for a fact that M. Night was not attempting to have me jump 20 times during the movie or leave me with the fear of going to sleep that night, maybe i would have enjoyed the film a little more. BUT, because I expected to see a horror movie and did not get that, i was very disappointed. All I can say is that if you plan on seeing this movie, go into it with a open mind, and maybe you'll enjoy it a little more than I did.",The Village
818,kmase,(Spoiler)Themes of Universality and Social commentary pervade this thriller,8,2 August 2004,"For me The Village was a giant social commentary wrapped in the guise of a thriller, the best apart about this is that it was never apparent until the end when it was revealed that The Village was in modern times. Once this revelation took place all of events of the movie took on a different meaning. If you look back on Nights last film signs there was a definite religious undertone and statement being made, from my perspective Night was again trying to make a statement; this time about the evil of man, the power of love, and the capability for strength in all of us. When Lucius got stabbed my initial thought was, WOW, but then I thought how will they defend themselves without Lucius, who was clearly the strongest and bravest member of the village. That single act sets the stage for Shymalan's commentary to take center stage; you just don't realize it until it's over. The stabbing of Lucius by Noah, makes the attempted utopia a failure all of the elders were trying to escape the pain of loss that they believed was brought on by modernity, they were some how convinced that if removed from those circumstances they would be safe from the evil of man and the pain of human emotion. By having Noah commit such a heinous act Shymalan is showing that the capability for passion, rage, and violence exists within even the most innocent. Shymalan balances that by making Ivey the heroine, blind and alone Ivey was easily the most vulnerable member of the village but drawing upon her love of Lucius she finds the strength to kill Noah and save Lucius. Ultimately I think the most interesting question raised is how much would we give to get back what we lost ? The villagers forsook modern life and all its accoutrements including vital medicine under the seeming belief that money and possession drove man to evil acts, and reverted back to an ancient lifestyle devoid of material wealth in favor of sharing working toward a common good. But when the utopian concept is proved wrong, by Noah they still want to go on. I think this was daring effort by Shymalan and it builds nicely on the themes he has covered in previous movies. It might seem like a stretch but that's what I got after seeing the village.",The Village

This movie was fantastic and sported some common Shamalyan themes but also introduced sooo many new and exciting ones that really made this movie not stand above his others, but definitely stand out.His timing with the scares, humor, and surprises were, once again, dead on and guarantee this movie elite status for the 2004 year and beyond.

820,razorwyre1,a disappointment (again),6,11 January 2005,"OK i was one of those who didn't see the twist in the 6th sense coming. however once i had seen it, and had a few minutes to mull over it i thought ""y'know, rod serling could have told this story better, and done it in a half hour"".(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) similarly, signs was nicely suspenseful, and although it didn't have a twist per se, i was left thinking ""ok lemme get this straight; these aliens have developed interstellar travel, developed technology that duplicates their own natural chameleon abilities, but they haven't figured out raincoats? (especially considering how much of the earth is wet?!)"" so today i rent the village. and very early on i guessed the twist ending. (i wish i could say i figured it out, but it was a guess, and that only.) i'm also fairly sure i would have predicted the deception as well (which would have given me the entire plot and motivation), except i had been mislead by a review at the time of the films theatrical release which said that the creatures were a let-down when they are finally seen, which led me to believe that they were going to be something other than what they actually turned out to be.i suppose what I'm trying to say is that while MNS is a fine director in terms of mood and handling the actors, if he wants to do these twilight zone-ish plot twist endings, he needs to get a lot better at it. even if you had figured out the twist on a TZ episode, the execution made the payoff worthwhile, instead of leaving you feeling cheated.",The Village

A director who has made twist endings and scattered scares his trademark. This movie has his most controversial twist ending to date. I'm sure most people are going to feel angry and tricked after watching it, and this is something Shyamalan should check for reference when he thinks his next plot.Still, you have to praise Shyamalan's imagination and attention to detail. He's the only director in Hollywood now doing something different. His formula may not work all the time, but it entertains at the least.I think the story is very clever, but to many he'll pass as a smart**s.I won't bother to tell you the plot since you'll see it in other reviews.""The Village"" must be the first scary movie I could let children watch without any concerns.",The Village

In fact, Shyamalan goes back to the principles of suspense: fear of the unknown, what we can't see. Which I find amazing to do in times when we're used to see everything.

Fear, jealousy, violence. personally, i don't think one can escape reality and live in a bubble. our societies are what they are, this is life, this is what we have built. on the other hand, we should always strive for a better world and react to injustice and violence in all it's forms. what beautiful acting, too. the violinist who plays the theme throughout the film is just magnificent.",The Village

832,barnfife-1,A great concept poorly executed,4,30 January 2005,"Having read several reviews of the movie (none of which contained spoilers) before actually seeing it, my expectations were minimal. I decided to watch the movie without reference to the director's previous films so I could simply take it for what it was. Even then, however, I was not particularly impressed. The concept was clever and interesting, but I don't think M. Night made the best of it. Most of the characters were not very well developed, so I didn't feel much connection with them, and the editing was uneven, as if scenes that would have created greater continuity had been cut out. This left me feeling somewhat annoyed and confused, not by the mystery contained in the story, because that was easy enough to figure out fairly early on, but by the manner in which it was executed.The cast, of course, was very impressive. Most of the actors are top notch, but none of them -- with the exception of Bryce Dallas Howard, who played Ivy, the blind girl who was in love with Lucius (Jacquin Phoenix) -- was given enough room to make much of an impact. On top of that, Phoenix looked and felt out of place as Ivy's love interest. In my opinion, he just didn't do a very good job of acting. Howard, on the other hand, did a fairly good job. The problem with her character was that she was given too much screen time. I understand that Ivy was the central character in the story, but the many scenes of her professing her undying love for Lucius were way too melodramatic and over the top for me. The biggest problem with her character, however, was that in way too many scenes she did not at all look or behave like a blind woman. In this respect, the most unbelievable scene was toward the end, when she was running through the woods to escape the ""monster"" that was pursuing her. I ask you, how can a blind person run through thick woods without once running into a tree or branch? It defies all logic and destroys the believability of the scene. In sum, the idea behind the movie was compelling, but the director did a poor job of carrying it out. It seems to me that the concept would have been better executed within the confines of half-hour or an hour-long TV episode such as The Twilight Zone. Rod Serling would have skipped the corny dialogue and meandering plot and stuck to the essentials. Sometimes less is more.",The Village

Although in the beginning of the film you really get spooked and you start to question yourself, what is in those woods? And you yourself get to use your own imagination which makes it scary. And at that point thats were you get excited and wanna continue watching the movie. But after a while the movie kinda tend to become somewhat more like a drama with personal conflicts and tragedy.

Or was he trying something new? It wasn't until the end of the movie that I realized it was a little of both. I think the film was should have gotten more attention than it did overall. As a character study I think he overachieved. As a suspenseful drama I think it was a little lacking. Joaquin Phoenix is a phenomenal actor. But I think his talents were a little underused. The plot was a little far fetched to me even before I knew how it ended. Anyone who knows their history is going to have a hard time sitting through this film without asking themselves a thousand questions. Suspending disbelief is hard when you are presented with a period film that seems to be riddled with incongruence's. The ending is watch you would expect from Shymalan, which was a problem for me actually. Expecting a twist is really not as fun as being surprised by it. I think he actually wrapped it up a little too tightly. We should have been left with the final scene of the girl standing in the middle of the road as the troopers jeep arrives.

838,sassbox222,Not bad at all,8,13 August 2005,"As many on IMDb and elsewhere have already noted, ""The Village"" was marketed terribly. I don't know what the people in charge of promoting this movie were thinking. I saw many previews and it looked like The Village would be a creepy and scary movie. It isn't, of course. There are some genuinely creepy scenes in the movie, mostly in the beginning. I have to admit I jumped a bit when the ""monster"" ran underneath the lookout tower. But soon the scary elements of the movie wear off and the real story begins. This movie is a very well done love story, drama, and mystery. Had the movie been marketed this way, I don't think the reaction to it would be so negative. It might have even improved audiences' reactions to The Village. People might have thought, oh looks like Shyamalan is doing something a little different this time, I wonder how it will turn out? Anyways, taken as a drama, The Village is pretty good. It's certainly not the greatest love story or mystery ever put on film, but it's still quite well done. Bryce Howard does a fine job of playing Ivy. I was most impressed by Adrien Brody's performance. I know that nowadays it's becoming cliché for ""serious actors"" to test their chops by playing mentally handicapped people. Brody does not wallow in this cliché. He plays this character in an engaging and very convincing manner. I did not even realize Noah was being played by Brody until halfway through the movie; Adrien Brody absorbed himself into the character that much.",The Village
839,bhamnida,A Film without a home,10,29 January 2019,"This is a great movie, one of my favorites, but it is destined to be an outcast.It is a classic period piece, with beautiful music, visuals, people, and language. The plot is near perfect. Every time I watch it I notice something else that hints at the core climax of the plot, but so subtly, I only see it after many viewings. The characters are nearly perfect as well, and Adrian Brody, if his character were more prominent, would have won an Oscar.It is also a thriller, with mystery, violence, and moments that make you jump as a horror film might. It will make you scared of the woods in autumn almost as much as The Blair Witch Project.The fact that it is these two things at once, there lies the dilemma.If you watch this movie without expectations, you will be disappointed, because it is fluid and changes, and is never quite what you thought it would be even as it ends. If you watch it with romance and Jane Austin era expectations, you will be disappointed because it is blurred together with something completely different. And if you watch it with Thriller expectations, the same thing happens in reverse.I believe no one could truly love this film as they first view it because of all of these truths. I know I didn't care for it the first time. However...If you are reading this review, and have not seen The Village before, you have a chance! A very small chance to truly enjoy an amazing movie, without knowing why until it is over.Let the film be what it is, a truly unique outcast that will never really belong anywhere, and enter in fully, as if you are there in the story.There are no guarantees you will fall in love like I have after just one viewing, but you might! And if you watch it a few more times after, and love great cinema, I can guarantee you will.",The Village
840,sepid-maleki,surprisingly good movie!,10,14 January 2018,I've watched this movie several times and it is absolutely one of my favorites.

I highly recommend this movie.,The Village
841,rick_gray,Terrible. Shaymalan can't finish what he starts...,3,20 June 2005,"Terrible movie. I have to say, Shaymalan has a talent for interesting story lines, but absolutely fails when it comes to finishing. Sixth Sense was the only movie I've seen where Shaymalan has been able to finish what he started. Signs, Unbreakable, and The Village all fall far short of the mark.As always, you can expect a story twist from Shaymalan in this movie, so you are already looking for it. However, this story twist descends so far into fantasy that Shaymalan spends five minutes of the movie spelling out the twist to you... because you'd never get it otherwise. Shaymalan does the equivalent of explaining a joke to someone who doesn't get it.Other than that, there are some interesting plots that are never followed through on, and some amazing shots and colors. The lead characters actually do a decent job.Even so, its not enough to save this movie. 3 out of 10. Shaymalan is quickly becoming the most overrated writer/director ever.",The Village

Night definitely picked the right actors for the parts. i think that Bryce Howard was stupendous for the role of Ivy Walker. she really was very convincing. i totally thought i was inside the village and witnessing the attacks from ""those we don't speak of"" it was very real. I thought that Joaquin Phoenix did an amazing job and he just swept me away. M.

The Village is a thriller, with strange creatures and interesting people, but it is widely based on love too.Joaquin Pheonix does a spectacular job playing mysterious Lucius Hunt. His performance was almost as good as when he played the evil guy in Gladiator.Bryce Dallas Howard is an amazing actress and I really hope to see her in many more films. Her performance as blind woman, Ivy Walker, was extremely believable. Her fear scenes were very well played.Adam Brody, a favourite actor of mine, also does a very good job of playing Noah Percy. His death scene was shocking and very upsetting. He was truly fabulous in this movie.The scenery is beautiful - it makes me feel like I've been missing out on the woods. The creatures look perfect for the part - real, yet not real. While many people came out of the cinema with a feeling of ""What the hell?"", I came out with a distinct feeling somewhere in the pit of my stomach of when something shocking happens, with some big realisation in it. This film made me think for a very long while. Well, grief leads you to do drastic things.Truly an amazing film. Definitely up there with the best. Thankyou M. Night Shyamalan!",The Village
844,Velvet_Roses,This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen...,1,26 August 2006,"For about the first 45 minutes, this movie totally scared the hell out of me. There is mystery and suspense and it's stressing as I've rarely seen. And then all of a sudden it completely turns over and turns into a crappy love story and each ""element of surprise"" just throws you out of the story and mood until you are actually discussing about George Bush's last war idea with the person sitting next to you. It is just a series of boring unbelievable events and plot holes (how can a blind person find her way into a forest) and clichés. Oh, the story is very unpredictable...because it starts with something and ends with something way too different. The acting is just all right, the screenplay is floppy and full of long, useless, meaningless lines...and ends up with the worst ending I have ever seen on screen. Good movie for an amateur beginner. Not for professionals. I wish I could give it no stars.",The Village
845,jfwilder,"One of the most stupid ""thrillers"" I've seen lately",1,24 October 2005,"OK....nice premise to this and clever advertising. I finally saw this movie on one of the movie channels and am glad I never wasted any money either seeing it in the theater or renting it.I certainly understand that there is some suspension of belief involved in watching movies, but this is worse than even some of the Jason movies where people just act dumb and beyond what is normal behavior.First and foremost, the village people seem to be all a bunch of non-thinking brainwashed weaklings. No dignity in facing death or scary things...just shrivel up and hide. C'mon...how many of you are there? Can't you gang up on just ONE alien and kick the snot out of it? Where are your guns? Even older societies and Amish people had guns. Where are your rebellious teens? We all know teens think they're invincible, so why don't a bunch of them gang up with wooden planks and go after this monster thing? Stooopid.Next....a BLIND girl walking around in the forest finding her way out AND back into this place? Oh...right...her other senses must have made up for the MILES of non-directional sounds of squirrels, deer and other creepy-crawlies out there in the woods. Why don't deer and bears set off those alarms or get the monsters angry? After finding out what the monsters are (SPOILER) you would think that those who walked out into the woods just once would have done that while all of them were sleeping and not dressed up as one. How did the people dressed up know when someone walked past ""the line""? Motion sensitive cameras? Infrared heat-seeking alarms? No...where would they have been hidden? Then...when the girl does find out it's all a sham and even goes so far as touching the costume to know it's all a crock...why then is she afraid when she confronts the monster in her walk out of the woods? Secondly...WHY (please tell me) would the crazy idiot dressed as the monster spread red flower petals (or feathers or whatever they were) around wherever he was to try to scare a blind person with a visual effect? Clearly that was an effect to make US think a monster was coming...it would and should have no effect on the blind person. Why did he have to dress up to scare her? She couldn't see the costume anyway. Stooopid.How also does she know it's a monster, not a deer, possum or even a monkey? SHE CAN'T...and this is a bit beyond my ability to suspend disbelief. Why doesn't the ""monster"" just walk right up to her and slash her or whatever it was he wanted to do with her? She couldn't have seen him coming? Maybe she could have heard him...but then there's no way she could have outrun him. Stoopid again! Instead running and falling into a pit that she really had no idea how deep it was...but somehow she knew right when to duck out of the way. I think they stretch the Helen Keller abilities of this blind person into more comic book superhero for what this movie was all about.Lastly, wasn't it just SO convenient that she walked out of the woods and just happened to have the boy scout of boy scouts find her and then not ask too many questions. And then happen to have the right medicine and get by the incompetent and supposedly bad guy park ranger dude who sorta knows what's going on. By the way, just how much would you have to pay or bribe...and to whom...to arrange all air traffic to avoid the area.Sorry if this spoiled it for you...it was ruined for me as soon as the opening music came up. What a waste of time. By far this is one of the more worthless efforts of this director ever.",The Village
846,djmoff,previews misrepresented the movie,3,6 September 2005,"My wife and I somehow endured the whole boring movie The Village. We feel that the previews misrepresented the end result and that viewers should be warned. We had seen the previews and had rented the movie expecting to see a horror movie. Instead we got a character study where nothing really happens. Besides that there are too many occurrences that ask the viewer to accept unreasonable possibilities.We are expected to believe that the blind heroine Ivy would be able to make her way through a forest, climb a barrier and then luck into finding a sympathetic ranger on the other side. Not just a sympathetic one but one who just happens to have access to the drugs that she needs. He gets them without question? Come on, how real is that? Of course, the hero, played by a sullen Joaquin Phoenixis is somehow able to survive the multiple stab wounds and resulting infection incurred from Adrian Brody until she returns. Amazingly the blind Ivy has no problem finding her way back to the village that no other person has found in years. I was willing to concede that a town could have been like this eons ago but with the SUV/TV scenes, we all know that such a town could not happen in this day and age. I guess the village was in a no fly zone as well. The fact that there really are no monsters in the woods and the town elders continue the facade at the end of the movie is mind numbing as well. The other shame of this movie is that former Oscar winners are wasted in such a boring misleading movie.",The Village

849,Vortimer,Impressive Cast paper over the cracks.,6,6 January 2008,"SPOILERS: When you see a M. Night Shyamalan film, you know there is going to be a twist, and in the case of the Village, you can pretty much work it out from the films setup. Still, the film is watchable and impressively staged, with a fine cast, including Dallas Bryce Howard, whose (good IMO) performance seems to have divided opinion, lend the film an air of quality that it doesn't really deserve. It touches on, but never really explores, a number of issues, such as how much the world is what we are taught it to be, superstition and the ""Wildwood"" that still lurks in the back of European imaginations, (I don't know if that extends to other cultures, it probably does) the role of the ""Other"" in defining a society, and especially in its use in social control. The village elders maintain their undemocratic utopia by creating a sense of constant outside threat that the villagers have to put much effort into combating, the safe and unsafe colours, painting the boundaries, taking shifts in the watch tower etc. and prevents them from questioning the status quo and venturing beyond the narrow boundaries and discovering the truth. Much could be made of how the film leaves the viewer to decide how they feel about the morality of Walker and his society, and how it compares with societies that use the same tactic, such as Nazi Germany with the Jews and Bolsheviks, and arguably our own with terrorism. I imagine the films fans use this to argue that the film has more to say than I believe it does.In my opinion, the film isn't that deep, and the entire hole filled plot just one giant Macguffin to hang the twist and the admittedly strong atmosphere on.",The Village

851,blastmain,Some Fine Elements But Disappointing as a Whole,6,24 February 2005,"Despite its other shortcomings, I did enjoy the fine craftsmanship evident in this interesting film. The score, cinematography and sets were beautiful, creating a unique and engaging atmosphere. In a market that's over-stylized and CG'd-to-death, it's a rare pleasure to find a scary film that gets its chills from the environment. Bryce Dallas Howard's acting was very good, as was that of the distinguished actors relegated to small parts. The story was interesting, with the added bonus that it dealt with one of the most topical subjects of our time: fear and its effect on societies.That said, I was never fully emotionally or intellectually invested in The Village. I found the plot to be overly complex and unfocused, with too many characters spread too thin. The romance wasn't convincingly moving, the horror convincingly scary, nor the mystery convincingly engaging. The script was littered with a combination of patches for the logical holes in the story and misdirecting details. Undue attention was drawn to elements which had little to do with the story, while significant items were treated so lightly I almost missed them. If not intentional, this could only be the result of a director who was too close to the production to see the overall picture. Whatever the reason, much of the emotional impact of the story was bled away by these distractions. The over-casting of the smaller roles was another distraction. When Brendan Gleeson, William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver are on the screen, one expects them be a significant part of the story.According to M. Night Shyamalan's comments in the Extras section of the DVD, the plot of the film changed significantly quite late in the production. This would certainly help to explain the meandering storyline. But the problem here runs deeper than that. I'm left to wonder if NIght himself wasn't spread too thin writing, directing and producing this film. The Village contains a great deal of creative energy which never seems properly directed.",The Village
852,duckmang,Extremely bad,1,31 July 2004,"When I was eight years old, my family went to see ""The Hunt for the Red October"" together, and it was one of the most agonizingly boring experiences of my life; being a restless child watching a movie full of subtlety and intrigue. Now, 15 years later, I have an experience to top that, and I can't use a short attention span as the excuse this time.When ""The Village"" started out, I could already tell it would be horrible because of the dialogue. The movie supposedly takes place in the late 19th century, but all the characters talk like a bunch of volunteers at a second rate Renaissance Faire.Then, as usual, there is the ""twist"" ending that makes Mr. Shyamalan's movies his own. I must give the filmmaker credit. It only took me 2 minutes to figure out the secret ending of ""The Sixth Sense."" It took me a whole half-hour to decipher this one. However, the minute I though I had figured it out, I spend the rest of the movie hoping against all hope that I was wrong, because it was such an insanely contrived idea. I've never been so dismayed to be right.Despite its flaws, there was one funny part of the movie that came at the end, and that was the retelling of the story of the woman whose husband had been killed, stripped naked, and thrown into the ""Dirty River"". I laughed out loud when I realized what she meant.Pitiful Movie: 1/10.",The Village

This movie is: terrible, boring, ridiculous, boring, badly written, boring, badly directed, and (did I mention?) boring.Bryce Dallas Howard was amazing, and I can't wait to see her in a REAL movie. She will undoubtedly be a star soon.Some of our favorite moments (which caused us to shriek with laughter on the ride home): --Joaquin Phoenix ""nervously"" reading his letters to the town elders. --All of the scenes where people whisper urgently about ""the BAD color."" (And, by the way, why is gold ""the good color""?) --The 3 or 4 scenes near the end looking up into the waving trees. --Each of Adrian Brody's idiotic, over-the-top scenes. --The many, many scenes where people just stood around looking at each other.Two or three -very- brief scenes WERE actually well done: --The scene where Phoenix grabs Howard's hand at the end of the dance --The scene on the porch with Phoenix and Howard --Part of the (otherwise absurd) scene with Howard asking for help near the end of the movie. But M. Night Sham messed this scene up, too.I enjoy many types of movies, including slow-paced character studies, dramas, and thrillers.

He just has a brilliant way of making you scared and when you realize the plot twist near the end of his films you are totally surprised and you realize his ability to tell excellent stories. This was a great movie with an excellent cast. The best movie I have seen this year.I must admit Ron Howard's daughter was quite good and she certainly has quite a future ahead of her.I wonder, What were you expecting if you didn't enjoy this film, most people keep comparing all MNS's films to The Sixth Sense.

This movie has been touted as a horror movie and it is not. It starts out with that premise, but quickly fades as the movie progresses. I was disappointed in that fact. I guess that I'm still looking for the next edge of your seat thriller that makes me want to go back and see it time and again. This is not this movie. Too bad.

Shyamalan seems pretty savy at using audience expectations. It puts him in pretty extraordinary film company (Hitchcock, etc.).What is wonderful about this film is many of the same things that are also wonderful about ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs"". Scenes that are given time to develop. A certain rhythm. Untold mysteries that never quite get explained.And really quite wonderful to see such a powerful performance by William Hurt, who has been missing in action for awhile.Well, if you enjoyed ""Signs"" or ""Sixth Sense"" because you had about given up on film making of that order, you will not be disappointed by ""The Village"".",The Village

Obviously they didn't connect with the film for some reason - or they were predisposed against Shyamalan going into The Village. Maybe they didn't like Signs? When a film successfully encompasses you in its world and has you thinking about it for days afterwards, it is a success in my book.

And that's definitely the kind of movie this is: love it or hate it. I put in my vote in the love it side. But even if you don't like it, you can't deny how well it was done. The music is enchanting and sent chills up my spine while I was sitting in the theater. That's something that very rarely happens to me (which is why I now have the soundtrack). It's just simply beautiful and fitting of the movie. In my own opinion, this is Shyamalan's best work. This tops The Sixth Sense in my map. Yes, I agree, that it is a little predictable (that's why I give it a 9 instead of a 10), and very different from anything he's done before. But that's what is so beautiful about this movie. It's a big risk to do a movie like this in our society. And ultimately, this is not meant to be a thriller, it's meant to be a character drama, and it excels at what Shyamalan meant to make of it. But I would recommend this to all who enjoy Shyamalan's work. The best cinematic experience you will have this year. Hands down.",The Village
859,echapelle,Gifted but not ready for prime time,5,10 February 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan is a gifted filmmaker who knows how to visually present characters and background. But, as in his previous efforts, he is a poor story teller. At the heart of all his films has been one simple idea - an idea that will always have you asking yourself afterwards - is that all there is? His films are more like episodes of Twilignt Zone; predictable and more suitable for a 25 minute telefilm format. 'The Village' is a beautifully photographed film and well acted but the heart of the story is obvious and you find yourself impatiently waiting for more than an hour to confirm your suspicions if you had not guessed it already from the previews. Or perhaps you recognized the plot line from at least 2 children's books published during the last decade, 'Sang Spell' by Phyllis Reynold's Naylor and 'Running Out of Time' by Margaret Peterson Haddix. In any case, 'The Village' is a disappointment with enough logic plot holes to drive a ... er... plow through. M. Night has a great visual sense. I think he needs to stop doing it all himself and let someone else either write, produce, or direct, while he takes on just one film role. He is not ready to do it all by himself.",The Village

So, for a lack of nothing to rent, I rented it, and I must say that I enjoyed the film.

The setting is gorgeous, costuming authentic, and beautifully haunting music. Also make sure to watch the credits, as you will see very nice photos of the area and the actors.Now, the film itself is not perfect.

On the top layer, this is about Ivy and Lucius and their love for each other. Lucius and Ivy have always known they were in love without speaking it. Lucius is also in love with ""The Village"", and offers to leave--risking peril of the forest--for medicines for the villagers. Later, Ivy offers to leave--risking the same perils of the forest--for medicines for ailing Lucius.

I watched this first when I was pretty young (13 or 14), and rewatch it about once a year. This isn't the scariest movie Shyamalan has directed, sure, but that makes it a good choice for introducing friends of mine to his work, especially those of whom are not very interested in horror or thriller-type movies. It's always very entertaining to see how they react to the twists as well. Maybe 8/10 is a bit high, but to me it seems like anything on your Top Ten list deserves a higher rating than those otherwise.

The scriptwriter should be sent back to school - albeit for the fact that the community in which these people live is remote, the stiltedness of their language is so excruciating that it is either to the credit or shame of the actors who attempted to deliver it. I surmised that the writer/director Manoj Night Shyamalan was trying his best to make the lines meaningful and potent, however he forgot to make them readable with the resulting effect that they become flabby and laughably meaningless. The actors were very patchy, and with such a strong cast, one would have thought that they were able to carry it off with more aplomb, and to be fair, in some cases this did happen. Particularly Joaquin Phoenix, who was gamely trying to make as much as he could of the script to be as naturalistic and as colloquial as possible. The rest of the actors seemed resigned to the fact that it was nearly impossible and gave in to the inevitability that this was one of the more turgid scripts committed to celluloid. The plot was farcical and the cutesy homespun scenes were rather clichéd. There were noticeable appearances of the furniture, all of Shaker design, or similar, rather telegraphing the fact that this was an Amish-like community but without the religion, oddly. The only good point in this film was the scene in which the red-cowled creature first appeared, which would have been more chilling if the film had not thus far been ridiculous. The inexplicable leap from the apparent recent death of a child in 1897 to the appearance of a modern 4x4 was baffling - a directorial fault, or conceit.

I only chose it because it was showing in my favorite screen in Manchester's last real cinema on the day it closed. I found it to be very slow and the twist at the end was entirely predictable. I see a lot of films these days thanks to my two sons, but the last film I felt was so bad and not worth the admission was Ben Stller's Zoolander and that's saying something.Sorry but I fail to see what all the fuss is about M. Night Shyamalan. I saw signs as well and although it was slightly more entertaining than this 'bum-number' I thought it was pretty average as well.",The Village

For example, the photography and the locations were very good. Also...Oh wait, that was all! This movie was really awful. What bothered my the most is that nothing of what happens in the first hour or so of the movie has any relevance to the end. The reason that it bothered me so much is that most of that hour was pretty boring too. There is no suspense, no interesting dialogs and the characters are flat and dull. In fact, hardly anything happens.Normally movies with bad plot have a lot of gore in it to keep the people interested, but this movie has neither. I wouldn't recommend it.",The Village

I was enthralled by the previews thinking I was going to be in for a heart-stoppingly good time, only to discover in the course of actually watching the movie that every single suspenseful scene had BEEN in the trailer! Mostly, ""The Village"" is a love story between Joaquin Phoenix's character and the lovely blind girl.While ""The Village"" definitely follows along with Shyamalan's characteristic twist endings, this one didn't quite pack the same punch as his other films.It was predictable, and disappointing.DON'T see this movie in the theatre, you're wasting your money.

They like each other now can we PLEASE get on to the actual horror? That's another thing. The creatures that all the townspeople were so afraid of are underwhelming.

It was truly a challenge to sit there and watch the starlit cast groping along with really crappy dialog. You know a film is in trouble when the actors are projecting visible boredom right there on the screen. William Hurt had one moment where he managed to wrench some emotive tension from his character....but at the end of the scene, it all blew over like a dry fart in the midst of the listless wasteland of a screenplay. The premise was a dead dog to begin with. Like other reviewers I was desperately clinging to the hope of some last moment spark of genius which would unify the film or, at the very least, breathe a single moment of vitality into the plot. Not even a wheeze! At each ""plot twist"" I was groaning audibly and kneading my temples. I shudder to think of what the screening tests atmosphere was like.

872,optwood,Plot holes disguise a criticism of ?who?,1,6 September 2009,"+++++++++++Starting with Spoiler+++++++++++++++So no-one can go into the woods. The 'elders' obviously can, but they have to sneak in to make sure no-one sees them. So where does all the wood come from? Also the blacksmith uses iron with no mine, The clothes are cotton with no cotton fields, and there does not appear to be sufficient cropland to feed the village. If this was it real 19th century village it would trade with other villages. So there MUST be regular deliveries of supplies to the village to keep it alive. So they CHOSE to let their children DIE and have childhood diseases rather than include antibiotics in their delivery runs. If they do not have delivery runs then they have a HUGE stockpile hidden somewhere which none of the children have found (or noticed). And why aren't some of the 'elders' injured. 18 year old boys KNOW they are immortal and at least ONE of them would have attacked 'those who we do not speak of' with a pitchfork.Now ignoring all these holes (and many more stated in other posts), one of the points seems to be about using fear to control people. Many posters have taken this to represent their own country saying that the government creates fear to keep their people in line. Well I say bullshit. The fear in 'The Village' is unverifiable. That is, the children need to trust their elders about the danger and are not allowed to test it or fight it. In the real world the citizens are free to leave their country and check out the governments word. To see if their really is something to fear. They are also free to join a military and FIGHT the objects of fear. There is though a real-world group that uses fear to control their people. Does not allow their people to question or investigate the objects of fear. And relies on complete trust. I am speaking of religion. If 'The Village' is a parable, then it is about the evils of organized religion.",The Village

876,riverspipe,Do I have to be the one that says it?,3,8 March 2005,"Let us just get it out of the way- M Night Shyamalan sucks. He is a horrible director. He glosses over poorly written dialogue and shallow, plodding scripts with sumptuous cinematography and good tunes. He is so inept that he cannot even get good performances out of William Hurt and Joaquin Phoenix, and the probable reason many people complain of boredom is because M Night. is no Kubrick- he does not know how to construct hypnotic sequences of dialogue between interlocutors, or even how to shoot dialogue effectively (first poor scene I remember- the daughter asking William Hurt for his permission to court Lucius). Nearly everything Noah (that’s the retarded guy) does is to advance this poorly written script, which makes it obvious that he is included only to advance it, and hence, more inferior writing becomes apparent (if the rest of the one dimensional cast did not make it so already).If the film wanted to make its allegedly ""brilliant"" statement, it was not necessary to have the film set in modern times- that was supposed to be some sort of ""whoa, I got you"" climax to make up for the preceding tedium, which, by the way, was not that difficult to figure out since M. Night prides himself on ""twists."" The revelation of the monster rouse is discovered in the least cinematic way possible. Instead, someone should have started to notice that the monsters may be a farce, and finally confronted the elders. More incidents involving the monsters should have unfolded (including all the rituals the people performed to keep them safe)- unless of course you enjoyed the redundancy of the interminable middle hour.The entire thread about living outside of modern times should have been discarded, since the film gives it short philosophical elaboration anyway, and it is not a brilliant rumination, unless you're the same person who just read Brave New World or 1984 etc. and thinks they have some sort of philosophical depth now absorbed into their soul. The plot line about the monsters would have been sufficient- it would have tackled the actions of the elders, could have taken place in the 19th century, and brought all the same philosophical qualms, which are not even tackled by the film, just raised. Unfortunately, even that plot line is shoddy and unsuccessful.",The Village

This film engages on another level, and if you want to be engaged on that level, you'll enjoy it.I've never thought of Shyamalan as a horror director. I don't believe it to be the plot twists that he cares about, so much as the exploration of human faith and belief.I grew up mormon, and have been exploring questions of human faith and belief since leaving that religion many years ago. I study philosophy of belief and communal governance now, and found this movie to be perfect allegory. The ethical questions this movie raises will fill hours of my discussion groups time.

'The Village' is extremely thought provoking, which, in my opinion, is the point of the movie.

880,ray-sammut,"The Beautiful, the Farce, and the Towns",10,5 September 2009,"Shyamalan's Village is a story about lies, beauty and ugliness. It is, most of all, a dazzling display of man's capacity for resolution. Of particular interest are some of the several themes that require especial attention.First, The Village posits a number of contradictions. For example, the child Daniel Nicholson inevitably obliges us to challenge the notion of ""innocence"" cocooned in a coffin lowered six foot in the ground. Later, his father August Nicholson preaches to the elders that it is pointless to run away from ""heartache"". This is ironic when all the members of The Village are doing just that, most of whom without even knowing it. And in the classroom, the little girl at the front explains how she inspected it very carefully. ""It had its head twisted back and much of its fur removed,"" she responds methodically to her teacher's inquiry. It is well established that indoctrination is deceitful and never serves as an alternative to a sound education. But Mr. Walker thinks otherwise. He is prepared to risk ""everything"", even the truth.Second, The Village is plagued with complexity. The hardest puzzle is the confrontation in the woods. All the essential details are provided a priori to those who wish to solve the riddle. The crucial questions, however, are these. How did Noah work out that Ivy Walker was in the woods? On her part, how did Ivy Walker work out who her pursuer was? We do not need to know the precise answers. The two knew each other well since childhood. They could read each other's mind accurately when it came to scheming although imperfectly when it came to love. The battle-line between them had been drawn in the quiet room. Only through fortuity Ivy Walker finds a possible remedy to her predicament and against her indestructible opponent. Owing to its intricacy, every detail in the story is relevant and nothing is superfluous. For example, the significance of the wind-tunneling effect that carries us inexorably towards the grave in the opening scene is manifested much later and is not easy to detect; at least not until we discover the acute scarcity of medicine and the sheer preponderance of the ""oath"".Finally, The Village offers a dark and an eerie experience, and this unfortunately may not be to everyone's taste. Not all is gloom, however. Check, for example, how the Latino security guard pompously straightens his work jacket before he sets out to confront the hapless Ivy Walker. This buffoon earns full marks and a payment for his bluff, but more importantly for the sensible way he deals with a most unexpected and tricky situation. It is also extremely instructive to watch Kitty lecturing Lucius on practical astronomy. This considering that the lass was offering her services on a voluntary basis and with passion. If noted carefully, therefore, The Village does have its comedic moments in spite of all the ""creatures"" and their doleful sounds. It even comes with some extra tutorials. There is, for example, a crash course on how to keep things under lock and key almost to the point of exaggeration. And Lucius' inquisitive mind schools us about men who behave badly when they avoid organic contact with women in order to mask their thoughts.The Village is well acted by all the players in a beautifully constructed set, with exquisite costumes, furniture and crockery. Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce D. Howard and Adrien Brody are constantly shoulder to shoulder and miles ahead of the rest in their craft. The music blends well with the drama, and the violin is always perfectly timed and with the right tempo. Water and its reflections are used with good effect; and I dare you to spot the fussing black spider in the woods following the rain-wash.",The Village
881,ox76,"sooo disappointing, and not a surprising end at all!",1,18 September 2004,"I quite liked The Sixth Sense, although when I watched again aftera few years, I was quite disappointed because it is told very slowlyand dwells on forever. Well, this one is MUCH worse. It's boring. It totally foreseeable - Ihave no clue how anybody could be surprised by the (very silly)end! - it's a very bad film. Good actors, but the story is very weak,the whole setting is completely overdone and the music anddialogue are very bad, too. What I found most irritating is that the suspense is broken everytime right after a situation has been created. I wont give examplesin order not to spoil the little that's left of the film for people whohaven't seen it yet, but let's say something happens while the girlis in the forest. It's meant to be scary and puzzling.

Because the first 45 minutes or so is really the only time you get to see the creatures and then they're out of it in which I was really disappointed with.Not the greatest flick on the block but surely is a freaky first 60 minutes.

The acting is impeccable, the story genius, and the overall effect touching. Parts are creepy, sweet, sad, and even tender; this is quite the mixing pot of emotions. Bryce Dallas Howard is amazing as the blind Ivy, and Joaquin Phoenix is heartbreaking as Lucius. Even the minor actors come through.

To sum it all up, if you like typical M. Night movies and stories, you will like it quite a lot. It takes a little while to offer real explanations for the behaviors of the villagers, but it is also easily predictable. At times the movie can be a bit scary, but I would not call it a horror flick, as the scares are short and don't do much more than make you jump a little. The movie is relatively clean of plot holes, except for the blind girl being able to navigate her way through a dense forest alone with nothing but a stick. I was pleased with the beginning and middle of the movie, but the ending was extremely disappointing. It ends with a pretty bad cliffhanger, as is typical with M. Night's movies. The concept of the movie was well-thought out, and kept me captivated throughout the movie. It would have been a bit more exciting, however, if it was not so predictable. If you get lost in the movie, however, I believe it would be fun to watch and not hard at all to pay attention to.

885,burchbeer92,interesting,8,6 May 2010,"""The Village"" had a very interesting plot. The whole village was made up of people who went to a counseling center to recover from a horrible thing happening in their life. They cut themselves off from the rest of the world and led a simple life based back in the 19th century. Personally I find that idea rather dumb but agreed with the intentions behind it. The director did a good job at hiding most of what was going on and revealing it slowly only as needed as the movie progressed. I enjoyed the fact that the three misfits of the village are the main characters and how much joy the village idiot brought to the film. Although most of this movie left many questions unanswered, overall it was OK. I think the movie was a little dry at points but that is to be expected from something of that time period. I was confused at how the village idiot just magically knew where the blind girl was in the woods or as to why he didn't speak to her knowing it was the girl he had feelings for. The blind girl did a good job at bringing the movie an extra sense of suspense because she had no idea what most of the noises would be in the woods. I think that overall the actors did a good job at telling a drawn out and semi captivating story. Although to me the ending was very dry and pretty much just ended without explaining what was to happen to the village.",The Village
886,ShutTheHellUp,Sixth Sense > Village > Signs (Some Spoilers),7,3 August 2004,"This film is liable to disappoint quite a few people. That being said, it's really not an awful movie; it's just over hyped and underdone.The acting is okay. William Hurt's line delivery is often painfully slow and monotone (especially toward the end). Bryce Howard's emotions aren't bad, although her blindness is questionable. Adrien Brody is wasted, as is Sigourney Weaver, who looks throughout the film as if she would rather be doing something else. There are too many characters with whom we are meant to sympathize, ultimately confusing the viewer; e.g., were we supposed to love Noah or hate him? Should we respect or deride the elders' decision to keep things the same?The first big plot twist is fairly predictable, but makes sense; it's quite a bit harder to see the second curve ball coming, and it makes much less sense. The ambiguous ending is unsatisfying and, to be honest, made me kind of uncomfortable with all the slow speaking and silence and pseudo-emotion and whatnot.Anyway, decent acting + okay script + decent directing = a movie that, although not great, is fairly respectable.6/10.

That it was boring, to long to unfold - not scary enough. BLAH! All this from so called 'film students'. You think they would have picked up by now that this is Shayamalan's directing style, and was also the success behind Hitcock's long drawn out movies. If you are not drawn to that type of film, don't see a Shayamalan film because, surly, you know what to expect from him by now!However, my friend and I were guessing his next one will be about Vampires in the cinema lobby..it does seem he has a particular 'genre' he is drawn to. But with name like his? Why wouldn't you capatalise on it!However, despite that said, The Village put my faith back in MNS. I was heart broken with Unbreakable and Signs didn't impress me. But The Village, for me, says 'his back'. I thought the acting was outstanding and the twists super! :P. It was just the right pace too and revealed enough to keep you guessing but always in the dark. Something new was around every corner!I really admire the MNS respects his audience's intelligence. Basil was hardly anywhere to be seen (for those of you who don't understand, Basil is short for Basil Exposition [from Austin powers] it means, a segment is put into the film to 'explain' everything). MNS believes audience's are smart enough to work the story out themselves but another aspect is by not giving away all the answers you can go back a second time and discover more!The dialog was very moving, especially from the Porch scene. MNS has really crafted a beautiful film - I defiantly recommend it. I walked in dreading but came out floating. I think people who criticise so harshly, as others on here have done, should wait till they have done a FEATURE FILM themselves - I can't wait, they're sure to be perfect.Anthony",The Village

""The Village"" is a haunting and thought provoking film that leaves me wondering about our own seemingly innocent and overscaled ""CULT""ure. Are we lead to fear our own borders? Frightening moments are preceded and accompanied by relaxing moments of love and ritual. Metaphor peaks through the surrounding woods, whispering details of a process lost with obedience.

When the audience laughs during the serious parts, you know you're in trouble. I'd like to see the director do a film without a twist. Just tell a good story.

But fair enough I said to myself, it's only the first half hour and most movies are boring in the beginning. But scene after scene failed to amuse me, and I only jumped in two scenes: When someone walked across the opened floorboard, and when one of the ""creatures"" appeared from head to toe in the forest.The movie was very anti-climatic and for the most part was incredibly lackluster and not scary. I went to see this movie thinking it was a horror/thriller much like the Sixth Sense and Signs, until I figured out there was nothing supernatural about it. It turns out the town ""elders"" circulated the rumor to scare the towns people into thinking there really was evil in the forest, when in fact, after the forest was a contemporary town with cars, rangers and radios. I have to say I was very surprised when I saw a car in a film originally set so long ago and thought it was absurd.I usually never think badly of movies in general, but the ending was very abrupt and disappointed me.

Then the story. If you are not expecting a copy of the Sixth Sense, then you will find a original plot; a mixed of romance, a sophisticate (thus, not cheap) thriller and original storyline. I think everybody know that there is something wrong with the notion of the ""ceature"", but nobody knows WHAT and WHY. It makes me very curious and here lies the originality IMHO.

I attended with my 13 yr old cousin who is over 20 years younger than me. We go to all the pg-13 & under fright flicks that we can as my wife and toddler daughter aren't big fans of horror/supernatural films. When I saw the advance press for The Village I knew I'd soon be a part of it's audience once it hit town. After watching the film yesterday, I felt pretty satisfied that Signs wasn't the best example to judge MK's creative potential by.... a sophomoric slump of sorts perhaps, but probably nothing more.The Village was a throwback to the creature-feature matinees I used to enjoy as a kid on Saturday afternoons once the cartoons had stopped running for the day. I suppose if I had gone into the movie trying to guess ahead of time what the 'twist' was going to be that I could have figured it out ahead of time but why try and ruin the whole experience for myself? That just sounds plain dumb. MK is no Stanley Kubrick but I don't think that bothers Shyamalan much anyway. He is a modern master of sustaining suspense without resorting to exploitative gore or obscenity just because it's titillating. If I had anything to suggest about his next movie it would be to drop the 'twist' gig if for any reason just to mock the folks that spend their hard-earned money to tear apart every film's plot as some sort of pseudo-intellectual hobby.Aside from the haters, anybody who appreciates character studies and high-quality acting will enjoy The Village for a multitude of reasons. Hurt, Brody, Phoenix, and Howard are brilliant. No goofy cameos or anything, just solid performances from a variety of academy award caliber actors. The dialogue and sets were flawless and engaging and ultimately, a lot of fun. A great film for a rainy Sunday, a large tub of popcorn and a few hours of scary fun.",The Village

I was pleased with understanding the point at the end, but some of the first half the movie was so slow, I nearly fell asleep. (I believe my husband did fall asleep, thank goodness for TIVO).I thought the suspenseful parts were good. I jumped at a few obvious places. And although I hate jumping in my seat as a rule, it worked very well. I just think there should have been more about the life before this town and why they were there. (of course, that would have to come at the end, because it would ruin the suspense at the beginning). I would like to see a Prequel to this one: what caused the elders to want to hide inside an animal park and pretend it was the 1800s? That is very interesting.",The Village
894,padi1984,Making sense of the Village...,9,31 July 2004,"For starters, do not, and I repeat, do NOT (possible spoiler)walk into this film and expect to be scared to death. The Village should be viewed as a psychological drama. I think that the advertising campaign really betrays this movie for what it really is. Second, without giving away the big ending, I really cannot imagine ANYONE getting the end of this movie before the ending is finally revealed. I don't consider myself the ""village idiot"", but someone has to have a ""sixth sense"" to get the ending. If you truly got it before it was revealed, I applaud you.Now, after that is out of the way, (possible spoiler) The Village was a sad, complex, yet hopeful movie dealing with isolationism and how our fear of the unknown can imprison and destroy us. Good performances is basically the glue that makes the story work, and thankfully, the performances are incredible. Bryce Howard is perfect as the blind heroine that makes the story believable and sad. Joaquin Phoenix plays the silent and brooding Lucius, with an almost puzzling and stunning brilliance. Easily the most disturbing and depressing character is Adrian Brody's Noah, a mentally retarded young man with feelings toward Howard's Ivy. The other supporting actors are excellent, with the shy and concerned Sigorney Weaver, as Lucius's mother, and William Hurt as the calm and knowing father of Howard.Yes, there are a couple of scares at the beginning of the film, but please again, do NOT take this as a preview of things to come. I have been thinking long and hard about how i would rate this film. It did not live up to what I thought, yet it was superior in the areas that one rarely thinks of. SPOILER: There are two twists to the film: a large and a small. They both serve as a significant ADDITION to the plot. The endings to the Sixth Sense and Signs were impressive, yet really do not add anything to the core message. Unbreakable had a ending that somewhat added to the plot, but the movie was stupid anyway. I'll wind this up with a rating of 8/10. I do recommend seeing this film, not necessarily in theaters, but at least once somewhere. And finally, and I'll say this one last time, (possible spoiler) if you walk into this movie and expect a mile a minute thrills, you will be severely disappointed. If you still want to see this different and intriguing film, then i highly recommend it.",The Village
895,friendslotrfan,he copied a children's book,8,30 July 2004,"I usually love his movies. Shyamalan has a way of twisting the picture up-side-down, connecting the pieces like a jigsaw puzzle. Don't get me wrong, the Village was beautifully written, executed, filmed, just plain beautiful. However, the film had way to many similarities to a book i read as a child. Without ruining the twisted ending,( that wasn't as twisted as one would have hoped) i will simply say that the story shares the plot line with the young adult book called ""Running Out Of Time"", by Margaret Peterson Haddix. I cant say anymore without ruining the movie. I would tell someone to definitely see the movie, the acting is great, its all great. But when you step out of the movie, go to a book store and read the book. i guarantee you'll come to the same conclusion i did.",The Village

Night (seeing and enjoying ""Signs"", ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"").So, I went into ""The Village"" expecting to see an entertaining and thrilling movie, which we all know M. Night is capable of making.What I got was a boring, actionless, non-thrilling piece of garbage.However, I would like to say that the only thing that saved me from walking out of the movie was the incredible performances (mainly by Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard) and the anticipation that the movie might actually take a turn for the better when the ""surprising twist"" was finally revealed.HA!I was wrong!The ""surprising twist"" was so completely ridiculous and predictable that I almost cried because I was so disappointed by M. Night.WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS HE THINKING WHEN HE WROTE THAT ENDING?For all of you who have not seen this and absolutely refuse to heed the warnings to avoid it, I pity you.When you see the ""surprising twist"", you will sit in your seat and ponder (because the surprising twist is revealed 30 minutes before the movie's ending) why you wasted $8 and two hours of your life!What's makes me the most angry is the trailer for the movie that calls the movie ""thrilling and terrifying""!It is not scary.M. Night tries to scare you by making the music in the movie gradually increase in intensity and then gives you NO SCARE.Everyone was so not thrilled and scared that I heard a lot of talking and joke-cracking during the supposed ""frightening scenes"".More often during the movie, I found myself laughing rather than being ""terrified and thrilled"".When the movie finally ended, the Friday night crowd who came seeking a thrill/scare exited the movie theater with groans and one moviegoer actually saying ""THAT WAS AWFUL""!I agreed!Avoid this movie!IT IS M. NIGHT'S WORST YET (AND PROBABLY ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN IN A WHILE)!I give it a 3/10(only because of Joaquin and Bryce)!Stay at home and watch ""The Sixth Sense"" and save your $8 for something that is worth the thrill!",The Village
897,timocox,Fear of the Unknown,9,17 August 2013,"I'm not going to write a long review, I hate long reviews. There are two reasons I loved this movie.The first reason: I love 'fear of the unknown'. For me, that's probably the only fear. If you know what's coming, than it's automatically far less scary. Maybe not even scary at all. So that's a big plus.The second reason: I love the big twist somewhere in the middle of the movie. It changes from horror movie to romantic drama. Beautiful. I understand that almost all the negative reviews on this movie come from the fact that the movie changes so drastically, and a lot of people feel this isn't good for the point the story tries to make. I love it. I love the fact that a movie isn't predictable. Also at the end there is a second twist, revealing the whole back story of the village.So, I loved this movie. And yes, a '9' is a very high number. I'm entirely aware of that. Enjoy!",The Village

Except maybe for ""Unbreakable"". I like his way of telling stories from the other side, always playing with the point of view. That's what made the surprise with ""The 6th Sense"" and especially with ""Signs"" which narrates an alien invasion of the Earth, but only in one house (just the contrary of ""Independance Day"") Here again, He delivers an anguishing story with a weird climate, with gives the feeling, without telling, that something is not normal about this 18th century village surrounded by woods that are inhabited by mythical monsters, ""those we cannot speak of"".I only regret the slight fear it provides doesn't last more. and the didactic time after the explanation/revelation doesn't last less, leaving some hope for the mystery climate to survive the movie. I ask it: when will M.

899,rjjrjjr,Another Very Enjoyable Shyamalan Film,8,30 July 2004,"I have heard several bad reviews of this film but I really enjoyed it. The majority of comments that I have heard center around the film not being what people expected it to be. If you go to the movie without preconceived ideas, you will like it very much. No matter how you slice it, The Village, is good storytelling and you will be taken in by it. There are several familiar faces from other Shyamalan films and you can expect great performances from them all. I was especially taken by the performance of Bryce Howard as Ivy. She is a fresh face who adds something special to her role.I think Shyamalan has a gift for finding a secret desire or fear or fantasy, that resides deeply in all of us and bringing it to life. He allows us to live in that world for a little while and makes us glad to be able to go home.I liked the movie and rated it an 8. I hope you will give the movie a try and judge for yourself. You won't regret it.",The Village

It said something about 3 rules like don't go int to the woods and don't wear red and don't make any noise or they will come.something like that and i thought man with Joaquin phoenix!It got to be good! And then when i was on my way home from Finland on the Ferry they showed it in the Cinema so i went to see.!CONTAINS SPOILERS!(THIS MOVIE WILL SPOIL EVERYTHING FOR YOU ANYWAY) Okay it starts and the camera films it all in kind a weird old looking way and have some similarities with The Blair Witch Project!! There's that blind girl who can't see but she runs as fast as a boy and runs the fastest...The movie is about 2 hours long and for 1 hour about nothing happen. The monsters comes to the village one time and i have to admit that it almost scared me more then The Turtles. Anyway after this it's kind of boring but then a psycho attacks Joaquin and Ivy(the blind girl) goes through the dangerous woods to town to get medicine.The Village is like a place surrounded på forest and nothing else. After gotten the medicine she is being attacked by a ""monster"" but she is blind so she lures it into a trap!!Now when we see and she does not we notice that the psycho guy is the monster and there were no monsters there in the first place.The movie ends. One guy is sleeping behind me and about the rest is just like can we go now?when i got out of the cinema one guy asks me: am i the only one to think that this was one of the baddest movies i have ever seen? So for Christ sake see something else!Honestly this is the most bad movie i have ever seen and with that 60 million dollar budget(the most expensive looking in the film is a hole in the ground) i think they could at least get a better camera! 0/10 Worthless as best!//Micke Finland Åland",The Village

It is quiet certain that M. Night has strayed far of course since the days of making the classic Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. His last attempt was alright but now he's just making gibberish.

But, when it came out, I heard from various friends that it wasn't very good. I missed seeing it until recently for one reason or another.I don't know WHAT people were thinking when they said this movie wasn't up to par with Shyamalan's other work. This was an amazing movie, and - in my opinion - one of Shyamalan's best. More than any of his other movies, this movie pulled me in and made me feel what the characters in the story were feeling.I wouldn't call it a horror movie, and perhaps that's why so many people came out of it unsatisfied. It was a mistake to market this as such. If you don't go into it expecting a horror movie, I don't think you'll be disappointed.If you're a fan of Shyamalan's ability to pull you into a story and tug at your emotions, check this one out.",The Village

While indeed still surely holding onto aspects of terror, the story did definitely surprise me in unfolding into one of such emotional magnitude. I wasn't too huge a fan of the director before this...I now bow in respect. The acting is beyond amazing. I was unaware before viewing that Weaver and Brody were members of the cast. I now understand why they were. The score is magnificent. The timing is superbly orchestrated. A glorious testament to the power of love.",The Village
904,BigJeffLebowski,A colossal miscalculation of a movie,3,31 July 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan is a talented director, but his films are often ill-conceived in one way or another. Sixth Sense was his strongest and best thought-out, but was dragged down by its Hollywood sheen. Signs was good, but self-defeating. Now we have The Village, which is, quite simply, awful film-making.There are so many conceptual problems with this film that they're not worth enumerating -- and even beyond that, they couldn't be discussed without giving away the ""surprise"" (which, aside from being quite poor, anticlimactic, and predictable in the worst way, comes little over halfway into the film, leaving you anxious for the picture to end throughout the remainder). There are no scares. There are attempts, mind you, but they all fall shockingly flat.The only dramatic weight comes from Bryce Dallas Howard. Though she is occasionally unconvincing as a blind girl, her performance is strong -- you wish there was a better movie to support it. Adrien Brody also fares well, but it's time Cherry Jones starts getting bigger roles that are worthy of her talent.Roger Deakins gives the film a great look and texture, but Shyamalan's shot composition is unusually weak. Unbreakable, though a mediocre film, featured his most accomplished camera-work, reminiscent of Hitchcock in the way he used motion and composition to further the narrative. But here, Shyamalan just seems lazy. Not only in how he sets up his shots, but in his writing, his direction -- pretty much the whole picture.Somewhere in here there's the potential for a good film, but almost everything in The Village is so poorly conceived or executed, that it's hardly worth speculating. The Village would be an embarrassment for any director, but especially one as prominent and self-promoting as Shyamalan. One can only hope that he gets back on track before he loses all credibility as a filmmaker.1 1/2 out of 4 stars",The Village

I don't like that people are ripping the director. His first film, The Sixth Sense, was by far his best, but his other movies are still very solid. If it hadn't been for his first, people would be singing his praises even more.However, I thought this movie was a total rip off of a book a read a long time ago called, ""Running Out of Time."" Toward the end of the movie, I really starting thinking of the correlations between the two, and in the end, realized I was right.I still think it was a solid movie and recommend it to people, if not in the theatre, definitely when it comes out to video and DVD.7/10",The Village

M. views giving me a movie paced on a snail's back, intermittently interspersed with a flash of movement, to be the driving force of fear. Well, he should not confuse reaction with action. I feel that, his attempt to hide and move in the corners of our eyes to be a tired cliché at this point. M...I get it, slow then flash ...oooooh, I'm so scared. I feel his talent is over rated. As a crafter of suspense, I perceive him to be elevated by a public in search of the next Hitchok...this ain't him.

I mean do you really think you can live in a utopia where nothing bad ever happens? Sounds like a bunch of idiots with a wild fantasy. Another thing does it matter what year they said it was it could've been year 3000 for all the people in the village know. Plus if there was a road in the middle of the preserve I'm guessing some1 patrolled the premises, how is it they mysteriously never wandered into the village by accident. Also, there were holes in how the twigs snapped and whatnot when no1 was there and no1 was moving. I tried to be entertained by this movie but after all the plot twists, there was nothing that couldve salvaged the movie. The ending was also completely horrible. They shouldve ended it with letting everyone in on the secret and letting them decide for themselves if they wanted to be isolated.

Too many movie-goers have to have huge budget special-effects, and fast-paced plot driven movies to be entertained. Atmospheric, ethereal movies that not only make you care about the characters but capture the mood and essence of the time period they are set in seem lost on these viewers. Sure, Sixth Sense was good, but I am less taken by plot twists than the mood the director was able to generate in that as in his other films. My willing suspension of disbelief was not overly strained in any of his films, and I think The Village was superb film-making, with excellent acting and cinematography. If you need big explosions and CGI creatures and car chases to banjo music, maybe you should stick to movies like Independence Day, where the jet-fighter pilot/President of the United States communicates telepathically with the alien invader.",The Village

Level 1 - There is the fantastic story. The scenario is really classical but as I said the form is pretty good especially as for the first half. Level 2 - A study of few people confined in a restricted area, you can talk of a golden cage. Level 3 - it outlines (once again) a very strong human feeling: the fear of the stranger, unknown, other help yourself.

I have been pondering on the numerous ideas raised by the movie and have spent much time reading reviews on the IMDb board. Seeing how diverse and passionate the overall reactions to the movie are, I realized that M. Night Shyamalan fully succeeded in his enterprise. **** SPOILERS ****Many people walked into the movie theater expecting a scary movie dealing with the supernatural. Instead the movie deals with modern society, the fear of others, making up lies, keeping secrets ..... and the temptation to create a utopian society secluded and isolated from the rest of the world.I am not surprised that most American viewers did not react favorably to the movie. ""The village"" is a metaphor of today's America dealing with its fears of terrorism and immigration. Shyamalan was inspired by the events of 9/11 when he wrote the scenario (something he talks about openly in Europe but keeps somewhat quiet in the US). The terrible things that each family in the village experienced in the past are symbolic of the trauma experienced by the attacks on the towers. Thus, the temptation to make up new fears (Iraq), manipulate people and build a wall around yourself ..... Lies, deception and secrets ....... Sound familiar ?Yes, this is not your summer blockbuster movie. It's reflective movie which makes you think. Each person makes up his own opinion about the motivations of the elders in the village. Whether or not they are good people or completely clueless. Yes, the outside world can be scary and reality harsh to deal with.... So how the does world cope ??? How do you make things better ????The movie does not provide answers but has the merit to make people react. Just like people are deeply divided on Bush and Iraq, people will be deeply divided on this movie.",The Village
912,ironman0304manutd,I wholeheartedly disagree with Aaron1375,10,1 September 2004,"I write this review in contrast of Aaron1375's comments so that IMDb users will have a chance to compare thoughts regarding ""The Village"". The trailer for The Village prompted me to see it, and without giving anything away, the film was quite different from what I originally expected. But in saying that, was The Village such a disappointment to be considered the worst movie of 2004 as Aaron1375 would suggest? No, far from it. The fact that The Village throws a 'curve-ball' is why I liked it so much, and the story, (the ""true"" story) once it is revealed, provides much to think about in regards to our society and humanity, of what we have become, what we have gained, but also more importantly of what we have lost.I can't say anymore because I want this review to be understood by those that have seen the film, but more so to warn those that haven't seen The Village, that the film should not be dismissed by the reasons given by Aaron1375. In my eyes, Aaron1375 was someone looking for a particular type of story, only to find something different, and because of that, was disappointed. But what was found, is far better than if the story had gone the way of a typical horror film, to eventually sit beside the many other empty-storied, ""I know what you did last summer"" style of suspense/horror flicks in every video store around the world, to be passed over by genuine movie seekers who want substance in their films. I will say this, the only disappointment The Village gave me was it's ending, yet upon after thought, I'm not disappointed because I see why the director chose to end the film as such, and to keep in mind that actions speak louder than words ... so keep an open mind. I am also shocked that Aaron1375 thought 28 Days Later was awful, yet that is another rebuttal for another time.In closing, do yourself a favor and see the Village, but unlike Aaron1375 don't look for what you ""think"" the film will be, but rather sit back and let the film take you where it ""needs"" to go ... and if you do this, you will discover so much more than you originally expected.",The Village

Second of all, the costumes of the 'monsters' reminded me of the ghosts in the animated movie, 'Spirited Away'. I mean, what was with all of the feathers? And their 'claws' looked like plastic.The Village's ending was also really weird because it just left you hanging. I have no idea what was going to happen and it really bugged me.The only positive thing I have to say about this movie was that Bryce Dallas Howard, the actress who played Ivy, the blind village girl, was very good.

And despite what I said previously, this movie also has a couple of scares which work very well.I won't talk about the storyline to not spoil anything for you. Shymalan's directing is excellent as always. The movie doesn't suffer from the pacing problems that Shyamalan's earlier movies had ( especially Signs ). The music is awesome, I still don't believe that it lost the best music Oscar to Finding Neverland.The acting is very good, with Bryce Dallas Howard stealing every scene she's in.

920,tctwc,Just mediocre...,4,10 April 2006,"First to say, I am not a big M. Night S. fan. Watched ""6th Sense"", ""Invincible"" and now this one, I find his technique too ""stylish"" (in a low meaning), his decisions - naive and his feeling of drama just kiddish.That is why I am posting this comment in April of 2006 - passed on this in cinema and now regretting of 3 hours of sleep spended to catch this on TV.Frankly, the only one reason for me to watch ""The Village"" was Sigourney Weaver, who's talent i deeply admire. She did her piece of work well, as always, but without any noticeable peaks. IMHO, Mrs. Weaver fans can put ""The Village"" deep down the watching queue - but thats just my 2 cents.95% of the reviews on this movie pointed at ""unguessable ending, unbelievable twists"" et cetera, but... i got it from the first dialogue touching the theme - that was 20 minutes from the start. Too bad for unbelievable.I can name many problems of the movie: slow timing, weak characterization, abusing of clichés, some factual incosistencies, but they all have one root - bad script. The main idea which i will not tell, is not bad, but neither new or enlightening. The story is too simple and bad developed. the characters.. okay you ve heard what i said..Visuals and music were decent for the budget - not more, not less. So only 4/10.",The Village
921,drwhobob-1,"No Sixth Sense, but I enjoyed it",6,22 January 2005,"Fortunately, I did not see the trailer for this movie, and had no preconceptions. I'd been disappointed by Unbreakable, which gave me lowered expectations for Signs, which accounts for my enjoyment of that movie. I decided to approach The Village neutrally and try to judge it without any expectations.I found an enjoyable movie with a couple of twists. True, some I had mostly figured out, but there were a few very subtle twists that I only realized after the movie had finished.If you don't expect a horror movie and approach it with an open mind and no expectations, you just may enjoy this work.",The Village
922,ugn,More mood and suspense from Mr Shiyamalan,9,23 January 2005,"I have enjoyed all major releases from this director starting with the 'Sixth Sense' and this film is no exception. It is beautifully shot, the cinematography and camera-work are superb. The pace is excellent with just the hints of unusual at the beginning of the movie, tension and suspense rising steadily throughout, building up to the climax and resolution. The cast is perfectly matched to the roles - William Hurt, Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard are perfect for their characters and deliver great performances. Bryce Dallas Howard is mesmerizing at times. The dialog is tight with very little out of place and so is the plot. Everything in the beginning has a meaning later on in the film. This is a film that deals first and foremost with people and human condition and it is cinematographically rich and beautiful experience. For this reason I preferred it much more to 'Sixth Sense' for instance, which follows a more conventional format. I have heard mixed reviews of this movie and a lot of complaints were with the twist at the end. Maybe you'll like the twist maybe not but it is a compelling watch just getting there and it is well worth the time.",The Village
923,Kai6869,Bad Bad Bad,1,18 January 2005,"This was by far one of the worst movies I have ever watched. I received this movie as a present from my girlfriend who is terrified of scary movies. We sat and watched the movie from beginning to end in complete boredom. At the end of the movie she turned to me and apologized for buying such a ""cruddy"" movie. This movie is a total miss. The creatures are not scary, the visuals are not scary, and the atmosphere is not scary. The plot is very predictable and the story line is completely unbelievable. (I'm sorry a blind girl is not going to be able to make her way through the woods and into a town with no help) I score this movie a 1 out of 10 and may God have mercy on M.

The plot was weak, the dialogue of the characters were so phony that it seemed like it hurt them to speak the words. I can't believe I paid $30.00 bucks for this DVD. The Sixth Sense was a wonderful movie that kept me guessing till the very end. Around every corner was a surprise and even though I guessed what the secret was in the movie before it was over it still left me spellbound and left my heart pounding. How could someone who made that wonderful movie and someone who made this piece of crap have been the same person. It seems as though he ran out of ideas or something. The Sixth Sense good idea, The Village bad idea. Is his idea factory all dried up or something even I, little suzy homemaker, could have come up with a better ending as well as middle for the village.",The Village

926,clancysmithesq,Bad advertising does not excuse a poor film,3,29 December 2005,"I love Shyamalan's films. His ability to take extraordinary events and place them in a very ordinary context, with true Everymen as the protagonists is a challenge indeed and he, usually, pulls it off marvelously. The dark, gritty, unpolished look of his films adds a sense of realism to otherwise impossibly bizarre tales of ghosts, aliens, gods and superheroes. The Village, however poorly advertised, does not amount to anything more than one massive anticlimax.The film is pitched as a supernatural thriller (no doubt to play on the spectacular success of films like The Sixth Sense and Signs). Fair enough. And ""twist"" endings are fun, in general, God knows Shyamalan is a master in the field. However, that said, when your ""twist"" ending is to undo the magic, the intrigue, the mystery of the film without replacing it with something of equal or greater value, you're left with a remarkably, painfully disappointed viewer. Everything that could have possibly worked in favor of this film came to a mind- numbing, insipid halt as the ""twist"" ending revealed the truth to the characters locale and historical context, deflating any and all hope of the supernatural and leaving us with yet another tale of misguiding good intentions and the decisions of a few old patriarchs and matriarchs that derail their children from reality. Blah, blah, blah. It was a boring film made all the worse by Shyamalan's taking a knife and stabbing his plot squarely in the eye, bleeding this film dry of the only thing that made it interesting; his realistic take on yet another interesting supernatural event. These decisions are inherent in the film itself and the blame cannot be placed squarely on the shoulders of a marketing/trailer campaign that pitched the film as something it was not. A few good moments, some talented actors (mostly wasted talent), cannot overcome what is quite simply a very, very boring film with an overdone moral and absolutely nothing new and fresh to offer.",The Village
927,Maverick00,"The perfect Thriller for your ""Average Joe"" kinda guy",8,18 April 2005,"In the movie The Village you have a group of people that have an old world colonial kind of town set up just outside a thick wooded area. The town seems to live in a fearful state because of the creatures that live in the woods. As the story progresses you begin to wonder along with a few of the other characters of the movie if this village is the only one like it and if the supposed creatures actually exist. When one of the characters is injured a blind girl volunteers to go out and find another town and get the medicine needed to heal the hurt man. Well she then finds out through her father that the creatures are nothing more than a myth used to keep the people of the village from ever leaving. So to me this story is perfect for the kind of person that likes the kind of movies that aren't completely out of the ordinary, like that kid that always says that movies too OUT THERE for me. Well The Village in the beginning half of the movie is OUT THERE but as it gets closer to the end it brings you back down to earth and is really a thriller story that you can say, ""HEY! that could actually happen!"". Well like I've said in the past this is just one mans opinion. But I really recommend this movie for people who aren't really SCI FI freaks but like semi strange semi believable stories.",The Village
928,dollybloodsmiles,Surprisingly perfect in its own right,9,1 July 2006,"This film was visually beautiful. It's emotion was deep and provoking. The score by Ottman was fitting. The storyline was full of subtle twists, and also direct. I liked Night's technique in this film, and i'm glad i watched this film. I can see why people would dislike this film. Example one: You go into the video store or movie theater expecting a ""horror"" movie, full of monsters and/or gore violence etc. In this film, you will not be getting that. This is storytelling, with a dark atmosphere. I've encouraged others to see this film, reminding them to go into it expecting not a ""thriller"", ""horror"", ""fantasy"", or any other label you want to tack onto it. In general people could do themselves a great favor by looking at films, art, and music, with a clear mind, and taking it in slowly. This is an updated modern fairytale, and fairy tales have no boundaries. Sometimes, you need to shut off the logical side of your brain. Give it a chance.",The Village

The films potential for cinema greatness can be sensed the entire time. Slow beginning, as per usual, but interestingly we're dropped into this charmingly colonial ""village"" with some seemingly super natural occurrences surrounding our typical Hollywood white washed group of villagers. The bad monster has a couple seriously suspenseful scenes thanks to who ever designed it's ominous ""witch creature"" look, but take a few steps closer, the spine-tingle wears off, and you realize that this monster comes off as more laughable than ghoulish. Throw in some sub-par acting and a lazy last minute plot twist and you've got a M. Night Shyamalalalan special!",The Village
930,valkaija,The Good & The Bad.,5,27 March 2005,"I think this movie is actually quite over rated, rather than under rated. Not because I'm a horror fan, because I know that hardcore puzzle seekers would also be disappointed. True, the plot itself was rather interesting, and the twist was even better, but it was poorly played out in my opinion. Not giving enough time for the viewers to gather the required fear and suspense to be able to go ""Oh, my goodness!"" once the secret was revealed. It was horrible timing. They picked a really dull part to announce the secret, and there wasn't much ""important"" events beforehand either. In fact, if they waited a little longer, and made a couple changes to the story, it would have been really cool. Most puzzle lovers would be bored, as there isn't much to think about, and no great mysteries except for the main plot. The horror fans will find it distasteful. It leaves a few pointless scenes around as well. Scenes that really don't make sense in the long run. I would post them but I don't want to spoil anything. It just seems that this movie wasn't well thought out in the long run. It seems slapped together and rather dull. Questions unanswered, even though there are no open endings. Maybe I just think too much.",The Village

Another aspect that totally screwed the film up was the ending where the leading lady arrives back in the village after a ""scary"" trip through the woods and all she can say is ""i'm back"" and then it ends. this was so horrible it was laughable.

Last year I watched it, I did so on a crappy laptop (no offense laptop) and the sound was terrible. I never understood the importance of sound until I watched it on my iPhone. I watched it again this year on Hulu, it just kept nagging at me. I understand all the bad reviews saying it's not scary. M goes deeper than that. His movies aren't jump scare C rated horror films, they actually mean something. And unfortunately (or fortunately) you have to be rather intelligent to appreciate them. If you want to watch a crappy jump scare, go somewhere else. But if you are an intelligent and empathetic person, this is a film that keeps on giving. Wonderful actors and acting, beautiful music, and a wonderful undertone in the film. M has a gift that few other directors have. His movies are much deeper than the C rated horror crap you used to find in the corner of Blockbuster.",The Village
933,doyle-va,A good movie marred by a bad twist,5,11 June 2005,"I really wanted to like The Village. The trailers made it look scary and the plot look very interesting. I truly could not wait to see what twist M. Night Shyamalan could come up with involving the creatures.But after seeing the movie I was left severely disappointed. I felt ripped off-for M. Night Shyamalan took the easy way in ending the movie. He didn't ponder up an idea that truly was good, instead, he tacked on an ending that I'm sure many had already thought of before the movie even started.BUT---I did like the overall style of the movie. I liked the design of the creatures and something does happen about halfway through the movie that is unexpected. It's not really a twist, but I don't think you'll see it coming.Bryce Dallas Howard was very well as the blind girl Ivy.The dialogue was very extraneous and wordy and boring.Perhaps my expectations were too high. The idea and execution of the idea for the first 3/4 of the film was excellent, but due to it's shoddy ""twist"" and boring dialogue, this film doesn't deliver to its fullest extent",The Village

First of all, let me say that I think this movie is a piece of art that has not been truly appreciated for what it has to offer. This is definitely a movie that you need to see twice. I suggest watching it as soon after the first viewing as possible. This movie is not ""The Sixth Sense"", it is deeper than that. However, it does share something very important with ""The Sixth Sense"". It shows that a good quality movie can be made without loads of profanity and such. ""The Village"" is a thinker mover and I highly recommend it for those of you who enjoy a movie that you can chew on a while after the credits roll. See how many lessons you can learn about society and yourself from this great piece of art. Peace.",The Village
936,jimpenson,Love story,8,29 August 2005,"I'd hate to be any director who hits a grand slam on his first try. I have to give Shyamalan credit for his effort on this one. ""Signs"" fell short, and seemed contrived and a little preachy. This one, whether you guess the secret or not is at its heart a very pleasant love story. First J Phoenix's presence is so intense and strong that you almost whither when he speaks. B D Howard is precious. I fell in love with her in this movie. The ending is abrupt, and I guess that's my greatest criticism, but by then I was so caught up in the depth of love she feels for Phoenix that I didn't care. When he announces, after several scenes during which he says little or nothing, almost angrily that he will dance with Howard at their wedding, and her sightless face is pointed towards his, there is no gushing emotion, or even a smile from either actor, but Howard's head moves after having been motionless for his whole diatribe, and moves in such a subtle and loving, pleased, emotional manner that you want to reach out and kiss her. She is a gem. I'll watch anything with Phoenix in it, and I guess my only general complaint about the movie is the same one that any movie portraying a sightless character with a sighted actor is that when you are blind, even if not from birth, your eyes lose their ability to move in tandem, the lids don't function as normal. No actor could pull this off, of course, but sometime I'd like to see a sightless role played by a sightless actor, not just someone trying really hard not to focus on anything. I watched the movie twice, and I rarely do, but the second time through, once the scary stuff was out of the way, I saw the love story underneath.",The Village

I can't really understand how this movie is just a 6 pointer here.All the ingredients are in the right proportions and blends perfectly into the storyline which is quite tender and authentic. The various characters in the movie come into a life of their own.

In fact it leads to horrendous things like the Crusades. Or Ivies ordeal. The reasoning was, better to be tortured now than to burn forever. What a lie that is.

Night Shamalamadingdong. Bring out the ole vaudeville hook too; anything get rid of this sucker.The movie plot is too simple to be interesting. The characters are not well developed. The flick has some of the best actors in the industry and yet we do not see enough of them. I feel as though the whole film was made to focus on Bryce Howard; not her character but Howard, herself.It is also very annoying that all the actors seem to talk in a soft monotone that is hard to make out. I suppose the sound was better in the theatre but on DVD or on the TV it is not a pleasant experience to keep having to turn up the volume.Why would you go to the trouble and expense to hire some really big box office actors and then hobble them with lame dialogue and incomplete character development? Why would you rather shoot dismal scenery than these wonderful actors? I would have rather seen more of Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody than I saw of mudslides, water, leaves and scary outlines of tree branches.The ending is ridiculous; Bryce Howard goes through trials and tribulations and gets fantastically muddy-dirty-nasty but in the end she is clean as a newborn babe....come on!",The Village
940,tanzanite12,My humble opinion,5,4 February 2006,"Although this movie contains a great cast, the story itself is lacking. The concept was good, but the writer seems to have run out of steam early. There is a potential for a really good movie to have been created, too bad it fell alseep.It almost seemed to have been forced, as if he was under pressure to produce a new script when he was dry of ideas. His other movies had a good flow to them that was obviously not present in this movie.Although I enjoy seeing M. Night doing his cameo's, much like Alfred Hichcock use to do, this time there could have been slightly more interaction, in my humble opinion. He honestly gave the impression that this was just for a paycheck, rather than an impression of his own enjoyment of his work.This movie was not advertised as a ""Horror"", but more as a ""Thriller"". If you rent this assuming to be a horror you will be disappointed. I knew before I watched it how it was going to end, and was quite happy to rent it anyway. I'll admit I was expecting more from this movie, and was disappointed the fist time I watched it. The characters will grow on you though, and the acting was flawless.Being part of an historical re-creation group, I was impressed with how well the mental immagery flowed. I do admit though, to having expected uch more from this film.If you rent this, keep in mind that it is more along the lines of Unbreakable for keeping you watching to the end, and very much different from Sixth Sense or Signs.The new one, ""Lady In The Water"" looks to be more along the same lines. Playing on your need to escape reality to a point. To loose yourself in the mental immagery of one person's fantasy based life.",The Village

This film is teased as a monster movie that we won't see to the end but the twist in the end raises more questions than the few answers. This is a one and three quarter act film. The acting and direction was above average, but Mr. Shyamalan started shooting the movie without finishing the script. I believe ""word of mouth"" will make it's $50M opening weekend it's best week.

There is not a single scary moment in any of Shyamalan's movies, least of all this one. Sure it's got atmosphere (hence the 3 rather than a 1), but -- spoiler alert! -- not for a second I could seriously believe that there were evil creatures in the woods...

However I still went to see it and I thought it was excellent.I had expected more of a horror film and I agree with people that the trailer is misleading, but perhaps if the trailer wasn't as it was then I wouldn't have had the urge to see the film in the first place.I find it interesting that lots of people guessed the ending.

This movie reeks! The plot is apparent way too soon, and the twists are more like slow turns. Insignificant characters are developed while key players are left for us to guess about their objectives and personalities. The secrets that are withheld from the viewers are mostly insignificant. The plot is released too soon and there is a feeble attempt to cloud it with trivial information. The Village is very slow moving. I kept waiting for the pace to pick up. If it did, I must have blinked. Mr. Shymalan, give us some credit for our intelligence and the ability to deduce future actions from scrambled information.

The cinematography with its vast arrays of light and dark, depending upon the message to be sent to the audience, and especially the heart-felt and touching music throughout is absolutely wonderful! The Village set is of itself fantastic! By the time the movie ends it almost beacons for one to return to its location. Especially in today's world many of us would pay dearly for such a haven of simplicity and isolation from what appear to be the evils of the world.The actors are first class. There seems to be such a unique bonding between the characters that one is left with the feeling of having known them as personal friends and confidants. By the films end, one almost feels himself to be a member of the village.What a lovely story brought to life! From quietness, to distress, to fear, to triumph, M. Night brings to each of his viewers the feeling that nothing is impossible to overcome - whether it be through an individual or a group striving for its own survival.

This would have to be one of the most unstructured movies I've ever seen. While M. Night has a good eye and directs it quite well, it's obvious from the start that there is little or no plot here. The brilliant cast is wasted (Adrien Brody, what WERE you thinking???), staggering through this mess of 'events' and 'dialogue' (I shall not use the 'story' here) to get to THE SURPRISE ENDING!!! Who would've expected that on an M. Night Shyamalan movie? This guy's gimmick has worn out it's welcome with me. After Signs I hoped he wouldn't do this to audiences anymore but it seems the man just can't help himself. I can't believe the movie-going public is still forking out $$ for this predictable garbage. I can't wait for the day that they catch on and this guy vanishes as quickly as he appeared.In his defense (so you don't think I'm just here to bash him) The Sixth Sense was brilliant.

Although two different genres of films, his wonderful use of color here can easily compared to Mario Bava. Beautiful cinematography and music. Who cares about the twists. Alas, all of Shyamalan's films will be forever compared the wonderful Sixth Sense because of the darn twists, but twists do not make a film. Here there is great acting, cinematography, music, and directing. I didn't see LITW either in the theaters because of mostly negative reviews but will catch it on DVD and I will buy The Village.

Most of the time they either spoil the story by revealing too much or try to project a story line that is false. Either way, you become disappointed. I find that the less I know about a film the more I end up enjoying it as it unfolds.

Most of the time they either spoil the story by revealing too much or try to project a story line that is false. Either way, you become disappointed.

This is my problem with the film: Why the heck does poor Ivy have to struggle through the woods? SHe's blind. Can't one of the elders leave in the middle of the night and then come right back? They know what is going on after all. No one else - - the younger generation- - need to know anyone has left. It seems cruel to let Ivy go. It also makes no sense whatsoever to let her go. I can see what Ivy has to go in terms of the audience, but when you get to the end of the movie, the plot has not made much sense.

Excellent performances by Joaquin Phoenix (he keeps surprising me), William Hurt (his best performance in years), Sigourney Weaver (isn't it wonderful to see women who can age naturally, with serenity and self-confidence?) and, most of all, Bryce Dallas Howard.

The highlight in the movie was when a young lady in the audience got up and stormed out of the theatre, no doubt feeling the same as me but with less patience.

At the time, when I watched, it had been billed as ""horror"" and was left with a weird feeling when I had seen it through. I saw it with a friend of mine and we both reached the same agreement. To put in a good way, i'll say that we agreed that The Village wasn't the best horror movie we've seen.But after I read a comment regarding this movie, it made me think otherwise. It is very character-driven and that is probably why I oversaw the movie in the first place; also because I saw it with a ""horror-movie"" attitude. Which I shouldn't had done. I haven't other of Shamaylan's (Is that how you spell it?) films, but I certainly will try to do so. But back to this comment; it made me think in a different way about this film. It has some weird twists and turns, but in the end it actually came out as a solid film. It is not though, the best film i've seen. Far from it. But i've seen much worse.

957,dexter59,The village was great!,10,16 August 2004,"I really liked how these people lived in the woods happy and peaceful. And these Woods are populated by mythical creatures who fear the color red and who will attack, and presumably kill, anyone who crosses the border from the village into them. They have an accord with the Village- you leave us alone, and we'll leave you alone. And even though the villagers live in a society ruled by fear, they live happy simple lives away from MONEY, but it was a lie. Give them a choice don't rule a society with FEAR!People get the wrong idea with this movie.I think it is because of the director's history with making a certain kind of movie, and that's what the audience expects to see when they watch a ""M. Night Shyamalan"" film. They expect to be sitting on the edge of their seats, waiting for those big TWISTS so they can scream out loud when they are taken by surprise (hey, I did just that in ""The Sixth Sense."")And that's exactly what Touchstone Pictures tried to sell ""The Village"" as- another thriller just like ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs."" Heck, they even used clips from those 3 in ""The Village""'s trailer! That is likely to frustrate moviegoers who will undoubtedly be disappointed if a thriller is what they expect to see. I should know- I'm one of those viewers. It's like Touchstone didn't know how to market this movie, and so they thought, ""Hey, we'll just sell it through Shyamalan's other hits and that will bring in the box office bucks."" And they're probably right, even though they have upset a lot of viewers in the process. That is what gives this movie such a bad rap!I think that ""The Village"" fell victim to the circumstances of marketing. If you go in thinking it's another ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""Signs,"" then you'll undoubtedly be disappointed.

You can figure out the twist in the first 15 minuets of the show. This movie drags from one scene to the next. The ""twist"" is pathetic. M. Night Shyamalan, can, and has done so much better.

961,fade_like_a_sigh2002,Creepy Beautiful: Unwarranted Smearing,9,9 January 2008,"""The Village"" is one of the few films that will, later in history, become a classic. If it does not, then we have lost sight of what makes a moving and essential film. It is both terrifying and beautiful, or put more simply as M. Night did in describing the work of Andrew Wyeth: ""Creepy beautiful.""There are several critics who have done all they can to cripple any power or mystique the film has into some cheap attempt to revolve a plot around a single twist, spelling out all of the details along the way. However, I feel that all of this critical smearing is incredibly unwarranted, and that despite M. Night Shyalaman's power and weight with the likes of the executives at Disney, he has established himself as one of the most talented and important filmmakers of all time with this very film.Needles to say, ""The Village"" is my favorite of his films. I cannot watch Ivy hold Lucius Hunt's hand in the final scene and say, ""I'm back, Lucius"" without feeling the heavy burden of tears welling behind my eyes. Even now I feel them as I think of the film. I think much of this has to do with not only stellar acting, directing, and cinematography, but also the music. James Newton Howard's score for this film is absolutely incredible, and I feel that even though he could have accomplished most of the film's brilliant atmospheric sound without her, Hilary Hahn is nonetheless an indispensable component to the music. Her single, arpeggio-filled violin pierces the madness and restores a needed sense of simple, minimalistic beauty, which is often equated with the love between Ivy and Lucius.There is much more I could write about this magnificent film, but there are simply too many points for discussion. This leads me to my final argument: ""The Village"" is worthy of deep critical analysis. Had I the time and patience to do it, I would prove it to the world. The film seems so simply executed, so perfectly and easily constructed. However, there are several levels of symbolism and repetition that could be worthy of something like what Robin Wood contributed to the films of Alfred Hitchcock, not to mention more broad universals like foreign relations amongst people.In matters of my personal opinion, I don't care what nay-sayers and bored critics say, because no matter what films he goes on to create, this one will always resonate in my mind, both conscious and subconscious. I think that it truly brings out that very human subconscious fear of ""The Other"", which, despite what we may assert on the surface level, we can all understand.",The Village
962,goplastic,The Color of Symbolism,10,28 September 2004,"Let's get this straight right away: 'The Village' is, by far, Night's best film.

I saw, however, another film. I saw pure mastery in Lucius stab, a beautiful and unsettling story, a symbolic allegory for the U.S., filmed in such a subtle and classic way. I heard a soundtrack with a genuine soul. It seems to me a perfect film, one that raises immortal questions about religion, fear and ignorance  something unheard of in quite a while from Hollywood (apparently we still can believe in the dream factory).It's hard to talk about a film that deserves a respectful silence, but also a discrete recommendation to our friends.See to believe and understand.",The Village

The reason this film is a 6/10 and not a 10/10 is that I really honestly was expecting it to be scary, the cover pumped this film up to be full of frights, even all the clips were making it out to be something it definitely is not. It should have been advertised as a mystery/drama type film, as I know I would have liked it more, as there's nothing more off putting than having your hopes and dreams in a film shattered.

""Signs"" was pleasant in that it had you on the edge of your seat, even if there was no surprise ending. All of these films were unique and poignant, with their own style and plot. ""The Village"" gives nothing new to the viewer except a bad taste in the back of the mouth. The movie, unlike the other films, was like them.""The Village"" has a surprise ending that comes from out of left-field while still not surprising anyone. It didn't challenge the viewer because the ending didn't make sense with the rest of the film.

He even manages to get himself in the film (the setting is a small village with only white residents).This movie will make you feel intelligent, because you may in fact be smarter than Shyamalan or any of the actors' agents.

966,custardpringle,Of course the monsters are real . . . (MASSIVE SPOILERS),9,5 August 2004,"********MAJOR SPOILER WARNING-- DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN THIS MOVIE********When reading comments on this movie, what annoys me more than anything is seeing people say that the monsters aren't real. The monsters are real. There may not really be humanoid porcupines in red capes stalking through Covington Woods, but there are most certainly monsters in this movie. Sure, I was disappointed that there weren't any ugly creatures running around tearing out people's guts to see all the pretty blood, but there was so much other cool stuff going on that I really didn't mind.What the Elders fear, and wish to keep away from their children, are the monsters of greed, jealousy, and hatred, and the people outside the woods who have become consumed by them. When it is said that the Villagers ""have always had an understanding with the creatures,"" the reference is not to the literal but fictional creatures in the wood, but to the people inhabiting the world outside, seen as monsters by the Elders who founded the Village. In this light, considering the common association of animals with fundamental innocence, it is significant that the Elders would choose to found their community inside a wildlife preserve. Animals are also associated with a lack of romantic love, which is even more significant, since love seems to replace money as a fundamental but corruptive motivation for the inhabitants of the Village, as represented by the Villagers' horror of the color red. (Walker is most likely aware of this shift, which may be why he refuses to act on his supposed attraction to Alice, but he is also aware that there is nothing he can do about it.)However, even in the first generation of children, we can see the Elders' plan beginning to fail. Money-- the corruptive agent particularly abhorred by the Elders-- is unknown to them, but another currency has replaced it: that of love, normally a relatively minor corrupter. A notable example is Ivy's younger sister, who can almost be thought of as an obsessive shopper among men; she becomes covetous of Lucius one day, becomes hysterical when unable to have him, but within days has married someone else without a spare thought for her past ""love."" Even at their wedding reception, though, we can already see her becoming discontent with her prize, and it is not hard to imagine that she will be lusting after yet another man quite soon. Other characters-- Lucius and his mother, for example-- also appear to be more obsessed with romantic love than might be expected from people in the ""real"" world. Noah, however, provides the most obvious example of love-as-money in the film: just like the Elders' loved ones were murdered over money, he attempts to murder Lucius for the perceived theft of Ivy's love.The supreme irony in The Village, and what I see as the point of the movie, is the Elders' inability to prevent their community from being corrupted. When the skinned livestock begin to appear in the Village-- presumably courtesy of Noah-- the timing coincides with the increasing overtness of the attraction between Lucius and Ivy, and Lucius' final admission of his feelings comes as a direct reaction to the ""monsters"" themselves invading the Village. Again, love is serving as a metaphor for money, and the ""monsters"" represent the corruption of the community to which their relationship will soon lead, and this corruption manifests itself shortly afterward in the attempted murder of Lucius. At that point, Walker realizes that the monsters cannot be kept at bay forever; he is forced to send Ivy-- who is the only practical choice, since her blindness gives her protection against the film's metaphorical monsters-- into enemy territory in order to obtain the very ""weapons"" that will save the Village from its monsters, if only this once.When the monsters are seen as metaphors, the ending can be read as similar to those of most monster movies. Ivy returns successfully with the ""weapons."" She has not been corrupted/attacked by the monsters, but she has nonetheless defeated one: specifically, Noah, the direct agent of corruption within the Village. With that ""monster"" dead, the community is safe for now. However, the Elders specifically name Ivy and Lucius as those who will continue to maintain the Village's isolation when the founders are gone-- and, through their intense romantic love for each other, they have already been shown to be indirect agents of corruption. As in many other horror movies, the immediate danger has been eliminated, but the future is still uncertain.OK, didn't mean to write quite that much . . . sorry.9.5/10, by the way, because Ivy's blindness *was* pretty unbelievable.",The Village
967,caschell,"The Village is about Love, and all that it implies",9,29 March 2005,"This is the second Shamylan film that I have seen. Just as Signs was about ""Faith"", his Village is about ""Love."" This film shows many facets of Love, which includes forgiveness, honesty, joys, heartache, dreams, future hopes, protecting community and family, kindness, and miracles. Ivy's blindness lets us see the world in a different way, and draws us in to see her character, her courage, her family and her love, which is very appealing. Her father, who helped create the Village along with the elders, loves this community and does everything he can to protect his family and the community from outside contamination. The Elders, for all their good intentions, still meet life with sadness, as well as joy, in this Utopian community. Lucius, in contrast to Ivy, has a different kind of facet to love--protective love, fearless courage and quiet strength, he always wants to improve this community, even if it means bringing outside influences, which is forbidden in their village to do.

The Village is his latest attempt to dupe us all into believing what he hallucinates. This is a worthless joke of a movie that defies all that is rational. It is an experiment in how to become extinct, both - for the movie folks as well as for Mr. Shyamalan. Thankfully the experiment works. One example -He has forgotten to do his homework and has miscalculated on precisely how much of land (area) is needed to sustain a community of 40+ individuals. Unless of course Mr. Shyamalan has arranged for the ""you-know-whos"" to provide the supplies when ever the ""you-know-whos"" visit the village!.

I don't like movies that can't even theoretically be placed in the real world, I just don't buy that stuff.Unlike other movies by Shyamalan, this one is (almost) not about ghosts, monsters and superpowers. Instead, it's about utopia (in my opinion) and psychology of the characters with deep emotional scars. Of course, it's scary.

Sorry kids...there were no humans maned at all...nothing to give you nightmares( unless retards scare you), or make you afraid of the woods and or camping. By movies end i was hoping that all the ""amish"" were killed once Ivy returned to the village...just because i hated them. I hated the acting more though...i really did.

It broke my heart that the morning of the release the radio movie guy said, ""There is a twist, as expected, but it is really lame."" Though Gene Shalit, Leonard Maltin and those other movie company whores lie, the Radio Movie Guy who makes less than you do rarely does. The twist is utterly pathetic, and I found myself afterward looking for the door so I could find an excuse to leave, since I had waiting so long though excruciatingly poor (Yet apparently historically correct) acting. Sure some of it is scary, but flashy costumes, music and well placed sound effects could make Dumbo scary. Shyamalan has paved his way through some potentially dumb plots and ended them well. I liked Signs (but I'll deny it if anyone asks) and I loved the ending of Sixth Sense. I guess he could have done a lot worse with the Village ending.

If my friend hadn't of convinced me I would have left just because of that.Secondly, while the acting was not terrible, neither was it great. Certainly no Oscar worthy performances. The acting was, at best, mediocre.Third, the big surprise ""twist"" was very easy to figure out. Two fourteen year old girls (myself being one of them) were able to figure out the entire movie within half an hour. Not to mention the twist wasn't that great. I expected so much more. Fourth, the ending... your thinking there is so much more and all of sudden the credits start rolling and your going, ""Wow, was that it!?"" It ended in a weird way.

976,gimmekrispykreme,"Not Bad, But Poorly Marketed",7,18 December 2004,"M. Night's ""The Village"" is certainly not a horror film. It's not even really much of a thriller. The film is, at its core, a love story. Played out against a Quaker-esquire rural community, the story revolves around a young blind woman, her boyfriend, and her mentally-challenged and very jealous admirer. Through a sordid series of misguided actions, the three are thrown into a somewhat twisted tale of courage, love, and revenge.Unfortunately, this was not the film that was advertised. The trailers and movie posters offered us a sort of psychologically driven monster movie-- and that's not what we got. Many fans of M. Night and critics in general felt slighted. This was not the movie that they paid to see.While it's certainly not a brilliant piece of film-making and, aside from a great performance from Howard in the lead, offers just mediocre acting, it's not nearly as bad a film as many are saying. An open mind and fewer expectations (of genre, not of quality) on behalf of the viewers could have made this a bigger success.Alas, however, the marketing people did what they did, the viewers expected what they expected, and the critics wrote what they wrote, and this is what we got: A decent movie that was treated like a horrible movie. 7/10",The Village

979,bugramps,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!,1,30 July 2004,"This is one of the biggest Hollywood crimes in a long time. The marketing department sold a product it did not deliver on. All the previews and build up was for a suspense thriller, and what we got was a half-assed love story and a twist that comes in the middle of the movie! There is a minute amount of suspense in the beginning but halfway through it we find out there's no need to fear ... whatever (don't want to spoil it for anyone though that wouldn't be a crime). The ending is just ridiculous and laughable. Night should change his name to M. Night Shameful until he redeems himself from this! He ripped us off! In the previews we hear the ""creatures"" breaking through the outside of the house in one scene in the trailers, but in the movie ... nothing! Just breathing. Further, the marketing told us that this was about these creatures but they are such a minor part in this film that you find yourself forgetting about them from time to time. Someone called this story disjointed, and that's a good explanation. Shame on Night and Touchstone's marketing team ... this should be prosecutable and somehow I think it should be: they call it false advertising. Night and Hollywood better start learning to respect the audience, because we're getting fed up with this crap!",The Village
980,annie_stru,A very underrated film,9,8 February 2012,"It is very sad to see such a beautiful movie being so underrated, I believe the problem with it is that it was promoted as a horror film, this was a huge mistake because it attracted the wrong audience. Horror film fans won't like this film that's for sure!The village is a beautifully directed film, with wonderful cinematography & atmosphere, great performances (I loved Bryce Dallas Howard powerful performance and of course Joaquin Phoenix & Adrian Brody as well) and brilliant story! James Newton Howard's score fits perfectly with the film's atmosphere and is also very powerful & touching.As a conclusion.. I believe Shyamalan is a great film maker and the Village is one of his best works, I highly recommend it!",The Village
981,xoxewan14xox,And intelligent movie that wasn't what people expected,10,1 August 2004,"I for one loved this movie with beautiful cinematography, an intelligent script, and wonderful intense acting. A lot of my friends didn't like it because they were expecting a scary horror film, but i for one didn't go into the theatre expecting one nor was i expecting something different. I saw this on opening night and enjoyed it very much even with the crowdedness of the theatre seats. The twists in this I thought were very different and had a point to them that made people think ""Wow, why would someone do that?"" Then you understand why they are in the secluded village and then you realize that people will never be able to hide from or keep crime away as long as there is love in the world. Because with love comes jealousy and heartbreak which brings peopole to doing things they never thought that they would ever be doing in a million years. That brings me to that characters in the story. There is Lucius the quiet, fearless young man who wants to journey into the woods to get to the ""towns"" and fetch medical supplies after a boy dies because of lack of medical supplies. Jouquin Phoenix did a wonderful job, but he is only in the first forty five minutes and it makes u sad to see him go. He falls is in love with Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Ivy Walker and that is in fact what this movie turns out to be. M. Night Shyamalan has made a love story. Howard was okay as the blind daughter of one of the elders, but i didn't find her very convincing with the blindness. Other than that she did a great job. Ivy is best friends with Noah Percy, a young man who has a learning disability. He is played by Adrien Brody. Personally I think that his performance stands out among all. He created this character that is in love with Ivy as well, but she doesn't know. And once he finds out that the other two are together it leads to some unfortunate events that lead to the twists of the story. But Adrien has created a character with depth that has some quite funny moments that provide some comic relief to this movie.But towards the end you can't help but feel sorry for him even after all that happened, and it is quite sad. He well deserves a nomination of some sort for that performance. William Hurt does a fantastic job as well. Even with its some flaws it is a great movie that is for mature teens and adults that aren't looking for the next ""Halloween"" As M. Night said it is him still, but just ""grown up""",The Village
982,omega_pinion,This movie cannot compare to the Sixth Sense,1,21 July 2006,"Since the movie Sixth Sense, I was impressed with the Twist Ending. However, the twist ending of the Village is not only disappointing, but leaves a half- hearted feeling to the viewer. I am not listing any spoilers, but since mostly all his movies will ultimately have a twist ending. The film, the village, presents a great atmosphere and is Good until the ending. *spoiler alert*. However, as a movie presented as a Horror Thriller, it leaves Horror fans empty handed. Is it a drama, no. Could it be a documentary? Yes, maybe that's what it should be. Avoid this movie like the plague. I, for one, after seeing this M. Night Sham a lot film, will not see any other movie he makes. I don't need a twist ending, I would like a solid story with no crap at the end that eliminates and deletes all the other visuals and story that you were intended to believe. I don't need to be disappointed again... Good Luck with the Village if you choose to watch it..",The Village
983,hodgkinsc,A political statement condemning the Bush Administration,9,20 August 2004,"This film is a brilliant exposition of the manner in which Americans are manipulated and controlled by fear, promoted continuously by the George W. Bush White House in order to push the administration's policies. The film is very well done and particularly enjoyable when viewed under this context.The Villagers are analogous to American citizens, Edward Walker (William Hurt) to Bush and ""the one's we do not speak of"" are the ""threat."" Warning levels (slain animals, markings of the bad color, etc.) are manipulated by the Village elders in a similar manner that the Bush Administration manipulates color-coded ""terror threat levels"" to keep the citizens in perpetual fear which ultimately and ironically makes them lean towards their leaders for protection, giving the leaders more control even though they are the one's manipulating the threat after all. There is much more to be said about this analogy but perhaps it is best to simply see the movie. I recommend it.",The Village
984,pyrocks,I expected much more...,3,24 September 2004,"This movie was a real disappointment. IMO the movie actually started in its last 20 minutes. until then it was reaalllyy boring and if it weren't for the loud music in the ""thrilling"" parts i could really sleep. The story itself is quite unique and interesting, but it takes waaay to long to when they start unfolding it. And when they do, it takes forever. on the other hand, the ending - the most exciting and interesting part of the movie - is really short and things happen too fast to actually be thrilled or excited. they just skip from one thing to another... I also think that the end was too obvious expected and you could figure things out pretty easily, much more easy than, lets say, ""the sixth sense"".I gave it a 3/10",The Village
985,cmcmsf,Bryce Dallas Howard Steals the Movie,9,1 August 2004,"First, I have to disagree with what seems to be the majority opinion. I thought this movie was M. Night Shyamalan second best movie (behind Sixth Sense). It's not without its flaws, but I thought it was very well acted by almost everyone, and WELL worth the time to see it.But bottom line -- Bryce Dallas Howard steals this movie! I don't know if it's just her, or a combination of herself and her character (great character), but she is truly amazing, and has a great career ahead of her.I really liked this movie a lot, and highly recommend it.And if Bryce Dallas Howard doesn't get a nomination for best actress, then some heads and hearts ought to be examined.",The Village
986,ocp1000,B-O-R-I-N-G,3,4 September 2004,"I never wanted to see this movie in the first place, but my friends did, so I taged alone. This movie was so boring that people in the audience started to take naps.Nothing interesting happens, and besides 2 (count them, TWO !) twists, the movie progresses as slow as that TV show Kung Fu. The acting is poor; Joaquin Phoenix seems utterly constipated and Bryce Dallas Howard (who plays a blind woman) does not even trying to hide the fact that she CAN see (in real life) - Come on ! Even Ben Affleck gave better performance at Daredevil.It seems that M. Night Shyamalan is a one hit wonder director. If people would stop comparing his ""latest film"" to the six sense, maybe people will think twice before going on another ""scary movie""Bottom line : If you have sleeping problems, buy a director's cut of this movie. You'll be down in about 2-3 min. :)",The Village
987,aeguy15,"Great movie, the marketing was done wrong, though.",9,9 August 2004,"This movie really was something extraordinary, the thing is all the teenagers and pretty much everybody were expecting to see ""Signs"" all over again, a big scary movie with bumps and jumps. But it wasn't that, but the trailer made you to believe it was. It was a love story, a science fiction, and a psychological thriller. It had many shocking scenes and many beautiful scenes and now I am going into spoiler territory, its impossible to discuss this film without it, it being two weeks after the movie has come out, I feel its okay.SPOILERS:The stabbing scene was absolutely petrifying. You had no idea something like this was going to happen. At every theater I know that you could hear a big GASP the second time when Noah goes down to stab Lucius again. Also thinking for about 3 whole minutes that the main character is dead is also shocking.The big twist in Shyamalan's movies was last minute, OH, he's dead, OH, he's the villain, OH, they die with water! The last half hour in this movie we all found out new things. The farce, Noah dressing up and killing the animals, modern day, just everything about it. Bryce Howard was absolutely phenomenal, and she stepped up when Joaquin got cut out to make the movie work and have a likable lead. William Hurt was also beyond amazing, his scene where he is talking about the elders about keeping the Village innocent was powerful, especially the second time you see it. Joaquin Phoenix was very good as usual.This movie is still very haunting, the sadness of the Village and the sadness of Noah, if you watch the movie again, when you see them running up to the sitting stone, you see the happiness in his face and you just feel your heart ache about the things that are to come.James Newton Howard is my favorite composer, yes, over John Williams. He's done such greats as Peter Pan and all of Shyamalan's movies. And he does not stop with his greatness here, the score is beautiful, one of the most hauntingly original I've ever heard.The Village has a great story, with phenomenal acting (even with the sometimes funny-sounding 19th century talk), a great twist and even a few scares.RATING: A-",The Village

It doesn't compare to anything else out there. The soundtrack is beautiful as well as the location that they filmed in and the use of colors. Acting is strong from recognizable talent (the director's cameo) and though pacing can seem slow, the movie is always going in a forward direction. Going into the film with no expectations does help. I also, never care to figure out what next?! but am there for the ride. I'm a huge horror fan but easily enjoyed this movie for what it is. At least its not a remake.",The Village
989,ho11iday,Exceeded Expectations,1,30 July 2004,"Let me clarify, it exceeded my low expectations. Meaning it was lower than I possibly could have imagined.After having the previews of this movie crammed down my throat everywhere I turned I half expected them to show a preview for this movie at the movie's showing. Even IMDb is littered with banners and annoying flash advertisements. Hype this big always leads to some amount of let down.But I was not prepared for laughably bad movie I was about to see. Now I am not a fan of M Night much. I didn't care for many of his films and I think they received a bit too much praise just for their 'clever' twists. I use clever lightly because the twist in The Village is just trash.The movie was ruined before anyone even sits down to see it. The previews make this movie seem like a horror movie, period. The 'atmosphere' of horror is barely present. The whole 'horror' aspects of the movie is just a big cliché with no real wit or 'cleverness' about it. Instead the atmosphere is broken up into extremely horrid and forced dialogue between characters that you can't help but laugh at. Before you jump on me about 'its not a horror film' I know, I half expected it not to be since M night is so 'crafty'. ***spoilers**** About 1/2 way through the film M Night throws away any surprise in the ending by revealing that the monsters are in-fact, the elders of the village just scaring people to keep them inside the village (big surprise there). He also makes the mistake of actually showing one of the monsters early on and you can tell its a sort of biped animal in a red robe insanely similar to their yellow ones. Anyone can at least come up with the suspicion that it just might be the villagers. Hell things like that are English 101 material.So, if you have the slightest chance to have your thoughts wander during the movie (which you will, trust me) you can ask yourself the simple question: ""Why would they want to keep them in the village?"" Then adding in M Night's 'twist' love its easy to guess the ending.I figured most people weren't surprised at all about either of the 'twists'.An avid movie goer could even spot it far before they tell you. The elder's speak of Guns and Alleys and Dumpsters. All of these things would not be in the vocabulary of the children. This village had no alleyways or dumpsters yet the old lady says to Ivy ""My daughter was killed by 3 men in an alley"". Yet Ivy doesn't bother to ask 'whats an alley?' Rifles were the firearm of that 'era' so the term 'guns' wouldn't be used and dumpster follows suit.*** Spoilers ***Overall I feel robbed. M Night has somehow managed to 'typecast' himself as a director. The only thing that would surprise anyone from him is if he made a movie without some lame twist at the end.",The Village
990,kieragriff,Was I supposed to be interested?,2,10 December 2011,"*(Spoilers!)* I nearly fell asleep halfway through this movie. The idea behind it is good, but once you find out that the 'creatures' are just people in Halloween costumes, the movie gets boring. And why send a BLIND girl into the woods ALONE? When half of the Village thinks that there's something OUT THERE? Really? There were maybe two scenes in this movie that were interesting. I had to keep checking how long until this train-wreck of a movie was over. The acting isn't that wonderful, either. And then there's that scene towards the end, when you find out that the villagers have been living in modern times the whole time. Seriously....? They didn't even TRY to fight back against the creatures. Anyone would at least SUGGEST they try to attack them, but no. Somehow that didn't cross their minds. Don't waste your time or money on this. It's terrible. Only watch this movie if you have trouble sleeping.",The Village
991,daoc_merchant,The Village a letdown,5,4 August 2004,"Anyone who spends time talking about the ""twist"" is wasting your time. The twist ending is largely irrelevant to the entire movie. Yeah it is there, and yeah you can pat yourself on the back for getting it, but it is about as meaningful to the movie as a celebrity cameo.The Village could have been a great thriller, but instead ended up a B level Outer Limits episode. The Village as social commentary isn't that bad, except that it doesn't break any new ground. Basically the overall theme of The Village is that fear is used to keep society in line. Sure the message is relevant, but most people know this and M.Night doesn't really bring any new dialogue to the table. Like most of Nights films you can nitpick the movie to pieces, but it is pointless because thats just how he writes his movies. M.Night is a big picture kind of guy, the minutia of details are irrelevant.The end result is The Village is a letdown because it isn't good entertainment. It is social commentary, but without any revelations, so the great setup and mood is ruined.",The Village
992,jennakn,If I had to describe this film in one word it would be:,1,1 August 2004,"Horrible. This film was absolutely horrible. While I do think it had an interesting premise and a fairly interesting twist at the end, those two things alone are by far, not enough to redeem this horrible film.I was so excited to go and see this movie. I thought it was going to be scary and I love scary movies. Boy was I misguided. I don't know which was worse, Adrien Brody's acting, or the dialogue.How did Adrien Brody get an Oscar? His depiction of a disabled person was incredibly offensive. Could he not have at least observed a disable person before he tried to depict one? I know many disabled people and none of them act like that. It was just incredibly awful. Horrible.The dialogue was awful. It was so boring, I couldn't stand it. Why must thou be so boring!In addition to those two things, I thought the world Night created was horrible. Night has done an exceptional job in the past of creating a world that we, the audience, believe in. This world was not believable. The first time I saw a ""monster"", I had to keep myself from laughing hysterically. The dialogue and acting certainly did not help in giving his world any credibility.Joaquin and Bryce both did an excellent job. They are both very talented and I hope that their future holds much better roles for both of them.Moral of the story: Save your money by not going to this horrible movie.",The Village
993,travelbug86,for those who complain about the dialouge,7,2 August 2004,SPOILER!!!! it's suppose to sound forced..why? because it is! these people are taught to talk that way by the elders .The way they speak is suppose to be a duplicate of the way people spoke in the 1890s however none of the elders were around in the 1890s. Therefore the elders version of the dialouge and sort is basically they're interpretation probably from history books and such . They're forcing it because they're used to speaking the modern language and all of a sudden because they're looking for a new life away from the greed they're forced to change and thus the accents rub off on their children . M.Night pay's every little attention to detail i guess he figured the audience would put 2 and 2 together,The Village

Those people missed a brilliant film that they would have loved.M. Night Shyamalan brings us a beautiful film set in the 1800's about a small village in a massive clearing completely surrounded by woods, where ""creatures"" live. The people who inhabit this town have a truce with these creatures, they stay out of the forest and the creatures stay out of the town.Recently though, some people have been breaking this rule, and the truce is starting to end. From then on, the film takes many different paths and ends up on one that you may have not expected, which those who love good film will enjoy whole heartedly.People who enjoy beautiful cinematography, great editing, an amazing film score, wonderful performances, and an overall very intelligent story should definitely see this film.",The Village
995,PutAwaytheDope,Well done film in general...,8,31 July 2004,"While this is not my favorite of Night's films, it is definitely still a good one, and well worth seeing. Without spoiling anything, i'll just say that a big factor of what made people think the film was not well done, was actually part of the twist. (clue - has to do with the acting out of the characters.) Yes i did figure out the twist, and it might not have been as good as some of his other films, but thats not saying it was bad. There were still a lot of other clever moments in this movie which makes me believe it was well written and well executed.

996,tannhauser_fi,A wonderful movie about fear,9,11 October 2004,"Do you want to see a terror movie? This one is not for you. This is a movie ABOUT fear and terror. About how the primal and deep fears that every human being has inside can guide the life of a full community, and how these fears can be used to manipulate and control the whole village's life.With this point of view, the movie becomes wonderful, even a masterpiece. If you are able to put yourself in a villager's place, you will see fear, desperation, love, real terror and finally hope and even salvation.And even more: You'll see one of the most beautiful love stories ever. What can a person do for love? You'll see...There's an incredible array of actors, making the performance of their lifes. William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody... all of them are great. But the real surprise is Bryce Dallas Howard. This is the first important role she plays, and it's a difficult role, the blind daughter of the leader of the village. I just can say that it's incredible. What a performance! She fills the screen with her presence.Another thing to remark is the cinematography of the film. Beautiful. Just take a look at the pictures on the movie's website.A really great movie.

That's what it's about! It is just breathtaking the connection between Ivy and Lucius. MNS knows how to make a very good movie and I'm sure that it won't change. And the MUSIC! Oh my God that's just wonderful, such a great score! James Newton Howard is the KING! No wonder he got an Oscar nomination for it (he deserved it a lot).So don't tell me that this movie is bad.

999,bassoonchef,Thank God I went to the Cheaper Matinée!,2,30 July 2004,"I am sad to say that my expectations have, in no way, been met. It seems that M. Night Shyamalan has finally gone out of his mind, thinking that this movie, with its thin plot line, terrible dialogue, and pathetic twist ending, for which he has become so famous, could pass as a decent addition to the ""suspense thriller"" genre. There is, however, a silver lining to this soggy feature, and that is the performances of Bryce Dallas Howard and Adrien Brodie. Howard, with this performance, has proven herself a more-than-capable actress, and really carried the film. She seemed to be the only one who was able to take the bland dialogue and convert it into something a bit more real. We can surely expect to see her in some great roles after this film, and maybe even around Oscar time. Brodie, as the seemingly gentle mentally handicapped person in the village, gives his best performance since ""The Pianist,"" which isn't saying much given ""The Singing Detective"" and ""Dummy."" William Hurt, as one of the village elders, gave a less-than-stellar performance, speaking as if he were in an episode of Star Trek. Joaquin Phoenix, one of my favorite actors, is underused and is given a very flat character. Finally, the great indie God that is Michael Pitt hardly has a part, and the one he does have is not worth his time. He should pick better roles than this, especially if he wants to become mainstream. As for the plot of ""The Village,"" M. Night needs to be dragged out back and shot. It lacked completely in character and creativity. He needs to learn that he cannot base all of his movies on a decent plot twist or, in this case, a terrible plot twist that you saw coming at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps the great Shyamalan needs to take a creative writing class and get some of those juices flowing again.All-in-all, ""The Village ranks as M. Night's worst venture into the genre thus far. Let's hope he can make a recovery back to the golden days of ""The Sixth Sense"" and the widely under-appreciated ""Unbreakable."" At least he has the sense to surround himself with good actors. 2 out of 10, and that is being generous.",The Village

I love that he is trying to make us use our minds to scare us, not blood and gore. In the midst of some terrible horror (i.e. Cabin Fever, the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Dawn of the Dead.) A great mind f*** is what we need. It's sad that some people don't appreciate that. Horror lost it's way and ended up being a scary, bloody version of Scooby Doo or remaking the classics. Creativity and talent are hard to come by, especially now. People need to open their eyes and realize that. Reviving Freddy Kruger and Jason is not the way to scare people, stuff that makes you think that that actually might be going on in some part of the world is.

That's right, say it with me boys and girls, the father's name was Mike Hunt! Now I can't help but wonder was this intentional on the part of the director, or just perhaps some weird over-site? I did like this movie, unfortunately you can't say a whole lot about his movies without spoiling them. I did think that Ronnie Howard's daughter did a very good job.

1003,lsgke23,Night Has Found His Niche,10,4 August 2004,"You'd think it was an ordinary little town but take a step into the surrounding woods and it may be your last. With The Village, Night has proved himself a master of the Hitchcock suspense genre. But be forewarned, although it is superior in some ways, if you head into this movie expecting The Sixth Sense you are in for a disappointment. It's not your classic 'BOO' horror flick, nor is it an Aliens vs. Predator special effects blockbuster, but that's not to say it won't keep you on the edge of your seat. Just as eerie takes of Philadelphia's Gothic architecture chilled us in The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan's The Village works its magic through the ghostly Pennsylvanian woodlands. It's cold, dark, and unsettling but the people carry on by abiding to the three rules that keep the creatures away. That is until one defiant villager crosses the forbidden line... Although not a special effects movie, the visuals are quite stunning. Night also recognizes the essential element for creating suspense, music. The film is accompanied by one of the most amazing musical scores in a decade. Furthermore he demonstrates his keen eye for talent. This all star cast fits perfectly into their roles and envelopes the story as though it was written specifically for them. Most note worthy are the outstanding performances by Adrien Brody who plays the mentally handicapped Noah Percy and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (Daughter of Director Ron Howard) who makes a stellar debut performance as Ivy Walker, the blind schoolmaster and romantic interest. Having won the part without even auditioning, Bryce brings each scene to life with her mere stage presence. Hopefully we will see more of this talented young actress in the years ahead. The Village reaches out beyond his past works and captures the audience with a much more powerful emotional attachment to the characters, especially Bryce Howard's Ivy Walker. The result is a thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking take on human nature (fear, love, and sorrow) with a few of Shyamalan's trademark twists. Unlike his second and third works, however, they are much more relevant to the story and fit more seamlessly into the mix. Overall, less of a horror flick than a suspense drama Night takes us on a less traditional rout. A path in which he has truly excelled, having both directed and written this, his best work since his original masterpiece. Excellent 10/10",The Village
1004,ooohhhmmyyyy,Do not see this movie,1,31 July 2004,"SPOILER ALERT I just saw this movie today and I liked it at first but it was the ending that spoiled it for me. The year is 1897 and I thought I saw a television and then I decided it was just my imagination because they didn't have TV's back then. Then I see a photograph a guy is holding and I see the picture is more modern just by looking at the clothes the people in the picture are wearing and you see a end of a car too in front of a building where the people are standing. When Ivy climbs the fence, she is on a road that is from our time and then a cop pulls up and you can see the car is from our time we're living in now. I totally did not get this movie. What was with the cars and the paved road and they never explain it and the movie ends poorly in my opinion and because of those two things, I give this movie one star. I think this movie is not worth seeing. A waste of money and a waste of your time.

1005,taker4life,"easily one of the most misleading movies of 2004...still it is a ""good"" movie",7,3 August 2004,"after leaving the theatre I always try and gather my feelings,thoughts,emotions, etc, so I can have a better idea about what the movie did, or did not have to say. after watching M. Night's third big horror film I was relieved I saved for this movie and not ""white castle"". I have no doubt that it IS a funny movie, but I only had 7 bucks and I would rather watch a ""film"" than a ""movie"". The Village has few truly scary moments in it that would make you shrink in you're seat, but what is there is honestly frightening. yes there are shock moments in the movie, loud noises when something on screen flashes by for .05 seconds.The creatures themselves are oddly designed, rather shoddy looking in some shots, however when you see the film frame-to-frame you understand why they look so shoddy. but they are very bulky and menacing, and actually made me wish that I didn't take the front row seat because I was a bit too close to the screen for my own comfort. I will admit that I was disappointed when certain facts were brought to light....then drawn back....then brought back into light again. the movie is so misleading that at times you feel like a yo-yo that M. Night has his hands on, and he is walking the freakin dog! the forest itself is the most frightening aspect of the film, with branches twisting in odd skeletal shapes, and fog shrouded areas looming every which way. a few actors really stand out after the lights go up in the theatre. mainly Bryce Dallas Howard as Ivy, and a very notable performance by William Hurt as Ivy's father. Joaquin is a very handy actor and I see him in other movies with bigger names in the director chair, but here he gives an awkward stoic kind of banality that I really did not care for.the movie's message is very noble and it's notions should be carefully examined and to a much lesser extent be practiced by people. of course there will be a twist at the end...this is Shyamalan for godsake! it is surprising if you haven't seen his films, and run of the mill if you have. 3/4 stars sounds good to me =).",The Village
1006,Kathrynicus,Shyamalan's different approach,10,1 August 2004,"I think that when people went to see this movie they set their expectations high and for good reason. After the monumentous success of 'The Sixth Sense' everyone was waiting for a movie where things jumped out at you and a plot twist that actually twists (which are very rare these days). People were disappointed when Shyamalan took a different approach. He used his monsters more as metaphors than as the horror type movies we're used to. I think that yes some of the acting wasn't up to par, but over all it was a very good movie. Very well done and something that goes against our expectations of what his movies ""should be like."" Shyamalan took a risk and tried something different with ""The Village"" and people were to busy trying to guess the plot twist than paying attention to what they were actually watching. Saying this was the worst movie ever made is a little uncalled for because there are so many movies out there that are 10 times worse. I was very pleased with the movie and I really enjoyed it.",The Village
1007,jrodibaugh-322-644341,"Enjoyable, but flawed film",6,24 June 2015,"The premise of this film is that a group of adults each experienced an event so violent and traumatic during their lives that they felt compelled to retreat from the modern world entirely. They set up an isolated commune in a nature preserve, recreated their idea of an idyllic 19th-century way of life, and coerced their children to remain in the village by terrorizing them with tales of ""The Others"" who lurk on the fringes of the village and kill those who stray too far from its borders. However, in the process of shielding themselves and their families from the big bad modern world, they have also had to cut themselves loose from its benefits. One of these benefits is modern medicine. However, these adults are so afraid to venture back into the violent world they left behind that they will merely sit and cower in the village and allow their children to suffer, die, or miss out on badly needed psychological treatment rather than go for help. The only one in the village whose love is greater than her fear of the outside world is, ironically, a blind girl. She ought to have the most to fear from leaving the village alone, but at the same time she is the only one who CAN leave without destroying what the villagers have created because she can't see the truth of what they've left behind. Additionally, we should note that this girl has already experienced great trauma (losing her eyesight), and has not allowed it to ruin her life. Therefore, it stands to reason that she is the bravest out of everyone in the village and is able to overcome her terror of the outside world to obtain the medicine she needs to save her fiancé. The problem with this film is the setup. During this period of his career, Shamalayan's name still carried a great deal of weight. People expected him to present a huge mystery with a mind-blowing twist at the end. That's what he does here. He creates this entire world of the village where everyone is afraid of ""the Others,"" whoever they are. He sets up this whole mystery about who ""the Others"" could be and what they might want . . . and then it turns out to be a bunch of control freak elders who started a cult and would rather let their own children go blind or die than walk five miles to get some antibiotics. It requires too much suspension of disbelief, and feels like a betrayal of trust that the director had you invest so much time in a construct that turned out to be a lie that was ultimately not worth saving. The film is obviously trying to say something deep about the nature of fear and love, but the twist feels cheap. But the film is worthwhile for Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix. I've been waiting a while for Howard to star in something that showcases her talent. I guess I'll have to wait a bit longer. She seems to be landing film roles, but they're mostly girlfriend roles or small parts in blockbuster films. I think she's a good actress, and if you like her, then you should definitely watch this one.",The Village

I think Adrian Brody did a great job and was one of my favorite things about the movie. If this would have been a first movie or an unknown director I think there would be a very different reaction, but so much hype has been building for this that it was just disappointing. It did not scare me at all, but has a good message to it. I would say go and see it sometime, but do not expect something that will scare you.

1009,mreed_911,Wonderfully Horrific Love Story,9,16 August 2004,"I am a fan of great storytelling and in this movie, more than any of his others, the storyteller in M. Night Shyamalan comes out.This is one of the most beautifully horrific love stories I've ever heard and it's been put to film in that encompassing way that MNS seems to be able to do - surrounding you in an immersive environment of the film.Without giving anything away (no spoilers here!), the twist that comes is at the same time wholly unexpected but completely parallel to the actual storyline - it changes your perspective but leaves the story completely and wholly intact. In previous movies, the twist(s) changed everything about the movie - in The Village, the twist(s) change everything about your (the audience's) perspective on the story, but left the movie alone. In this right, MNS has demonstrated a thoroughness of thought that few other writer/director/producers seem to put into a single sub-plot.Not that everything was a surprise - many things in this movie are plainly evident, almost daring you to question your beliefs in the utterly obvious. In the end, however, you question WHY you believe the obvious.Strongly recommended, a real ""makes you think"" movie that incorporates the best of true horror with the best storytelling so far this decade.-- Mike :)",The Village
1010,p_mcmanis,"A good movie, regardless of what some say",10,9 August 2004,"The Village is one of the best movies to come out in a while now (excluding some certain sequels). Why ten percent of the voters gave this a 1 just to make the ranking lower baffles me. This movie deserves about an 8. It is not a horror movie, though there are some intense (read:not really scary) scenes. I personally didn't really appreciate the end, I thought it was unnecessary, but I loved the rest of the movie. It is very thoughtful and insightful about the direction our culture has gone from that of our forefathers. It is different from what your are expecting. I really wish that some things were real when they weren't. And vice versa. It would have een a completely different movie then. Go see it, it is worth your money. But go into it completely open minded",The Village
1011,VaporFlux,Very interesting concept,8,2 August 2004,"No spoilers in this comment, so read on. I found this film to be not quite so good as the Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but better than Signs. The sense of isolation, a main theme of the film, was superbly imparted and added a great deal to the psychological impact of the movie. Watching the film, I felt a strong sense of uneasiness and anxiety whenever the very palpable division between Covington and the surrounding woods was shown. This feeling of apprehension was noticeably stronger during scenes which took place closer to the borders of the woods. Shyamalan, as always, proves adept at instilling a sense tension and fear by showing less instead of more. Another aspect of the film worth noting is the vivid use of colors in the costumes and the flags and banners in the village. These bright colors stand out markedly in contrast with the dark woods and usually overcast sky and serve to drive home the fact that Covington is an island surrounded by a dark, dangerous, and unknown forest. The acting was generally very good, particularly so in the case of the girl who played Ivy Walker. She managed to display a very realistic mixture of strength and fear. Joaquin Phoenix also did a good job portraying a brave, good-hearted Lucius Hunt. With regard to another Shyamalan trademark, this film had a couple plot twists. One of the twists was pretty obvious and I saw it coming from a mile off, while the other took me completely by surprise and made up for the obviousness of the other. Overall, I found the the Village to be a great psychological suspense film with a refreshingly new concept at its core. 8/10",The Village
1012,TruthHolder,Possibly one of the best movies of the summer. [SLIGHT SPOILERS],10,3 August 2004,"I've come to expect a lot from M. Night Shyamalan. My expectations have never been met precisely. They've been blown away. 'The Village' is no exception. Beautifully photographed, well played, masterfully edited, this film is a tribute to the art of film-making. I have a habit of studying movies for application to my classes (I am a film student), but I found myself riveted by this film. The first time I saw it, I was unable to make any analysis during the film. All I could say was ""Wow."" M. Night has once again stepped beyond the boundaries set by previous films.It's interesting to see the writer's exploration through the past four films. Not only is there marked improvement from movie to movie, there is a sense that M. Night is experimenting with various ideas. In 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable,' he played with the story twist of a main character not being what he seemed throughout the major part of the story. In 'Signs,' he used the technique of placing clues throughout the movie as to how the story will end, then tying them all together in one big circumstance. In 'The Village,' he turned the twist used in his first two films around. The whole world that the characters were living in was not what it seemed throughout the duration of the movie.It's interesting to see how M. Night used hand-held in this feature. Previously, he used hand-held a lot to invoke a sense of connection to the characters and a bit of chaos to the film. In 'The Village,' he limited hand-held quite a bit. M. Night seems to be a director who likes to break the trend of Hollywood. For example, it seems that several directors are becoming fascinated with quick editing techniques made famous by Guy Ritchie. M. Night doesn't do that. The entire last scene was one shot. The whole scene inside the park ranger's office was one shot.Overall, this was an amazing journey into the lives and fears of the people living in this village.",The Village
1013,KeyHorseMaster21,Much better than reviews say (spoilers),9,30 July 2004,"The reviews I have seen here and other places are way too scathing. I don't know if people were just expecting too much and were disappointed when they didn't get it or what. But this movie had tons of twists, and there was subplot, there were multiple main plots, it was diverse and complicated but at the same time entertaining and easy to understand. It kept you guessing and on the edge of suspense and fright without actually showing you anything blatantly scary for the most part. I'm usually really good at guessing the surprises of movies, and when my friends and I saw the movie we guessed some of it, but were really thrown off by other parts. No one really saw Lucius being stabbed, half of us guessed it was set in modern times, and maybe half of us guessed that the creatures werent real, but most of us were thrown off by the creature (Noah) in the forest that showed up when Ivy was walking. I think people that say ""I guessed the whole thing, it was bad and it wasn't as scary as i expected"" were just hyping themselves up too much, or they are full of crap.

Night's work and I haven't been overly impressed with his past work but it hasn't been too awful so I hoped that maybe he had improved upon his movie making. I was wrong. It's not an awful movie but it's been done before and M. Night's twists are getting more and more predictable. Basically the movie is about a tiny olden time village with people who are afraid to go into the woods because creatures live there. They have an understanding that if they don't go into the woods the creatures won't come into their village. They for some reason don't like the color yellow and the color red attracts them. One man in the village wants to go out of town for medicines into the woods which starts the creatures coming into the town. Stuff happens a predictable twist happens and the movie ends. Over all I wasn't that impressed but I have seen worse movies. I gave it a 4, so if you're an M. night fan go see it...it's exactly like his other movies.

1015,jpswiss,Better in the good old days?,6,18 February 2005,"How goes the saying: ""it was so much better in the good old days""? Or was it worse? The quest for a more natural - therefore ""safer"" - way of life is threatened by the absence of medicine, and someone may die. Therefore, the quest itself becomes threatened less its fantasy is revealed. Escapism is then proved futile. But the movie doesn't tell us that, it implies it only. We may ponder what future awaits the Village. What is depicted, is an Amish or Quaker-like society that is artificially re-created. But like the boys in Lord Of The Flies, a return to ""original"" values has warts, lots of them, in the woods, monsters to whom sacrifices are due and whom we are to fear. And that's not the only fear in this movie: we learn also to despise disarray and mistrust; we cannot live with fear, we must deal with honesty. Photography is very good, if as plain as the required costumes. The script lacks the twists we expect after The Sixth Sense, too much is hinted before revealed, therefore predictable. The assumption of a restricted airspace is incredible, unless one never spent sometime in the remote woods of Pennsylvania, or any other Northeastern State. Don't expect stunning effects, unbearable moral drama or shock of sudden gore: this film is  and somehow to its credit, and to the credit of its actors - plain, as plain as the Society its participants aim for.

There is no twist ending because 1/3 of the way through the movie everything is revealed minus a few details which are not necessary to understand what is going on. I rather enjoyed M. Night Shamaylan's work up until this point. I was extremely disappointed with this movie as it was billed as a horror movie. If you've seen 13th warrior there is no need to see this movie, as it has a very similar plot. If you were planning on seeing this movie rent 13th warrior and save yourself the few dollars that you would spend on the movie ticket.

But the story, though good, was not the strong point. No, I thought that the solid acting was. Ron Howard's daughter was great as the blind girl who was a lovable character. Pheonix, who played the shy, quiet, and alittle too curious and fearless character, was also superb. But one of the best acting came from Adrien Brody, as the mentally ill, character that could of either been loved or hated. Oh, and Weaver and Hurt wern't bad too.The story was great, the acting was great, the scenery was great, and if you wern't already predicting the ending after an hour of the movie than you'll probably think that this movie was great too. But for some of us who did, than oh well, better luck next time M. Night. for making a movie that is'nt predictable like your others. But, on the other hand , I'll still be first in line to see them.

1018,jnbrady3,Another great M. Night film,8,30 July 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan comes through again. So many people panned this movie, but I loved it. Even if you figure out plot twists, that doesn't mean you don't enjoy the movie. M. Night really knows how to do the whole foreboding thing. Joaquin Phoenix and newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard are awesome! Joaquin is great as the strong but silent Lucius. Ron Howard's daughter really makes her mark in this movie. I'm sure we'll be seeing lots of her in the future. It's amazing that this movie managed to keep its secrets from the world.

I wont spoil anything, but between the halfway point and the 3/4 mark in the film, there is a revaluation which basically ends the suspense in the movie. >From this point on, the viewer can pretty much decipher for themselves the ""surprise ending."" Also, because the suspense is killed at that point, the movie drags on listlessly to the end. All in all, IMO The Village is M. Night's worst film to date out of the four he has already done. Interesting premise, but the writing and planning out of the time line in the script makes for a dull and non-engaging film.",The Village

It was almost that they wanted to do everything in their power to stop this movie from succeeding. The film goers have answered.That said, it is a very pretty movie, quite Hitchcockian in style. So much controversy has been evoked, it is worth watching just to find out what the hoopla is all about.Although much has been said in comments here about how wooden Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, etc. were, when you analyze the movie based on the ending, it seems necessary that they act wooden. That is what their characters demanded of them. Shyamalan does what Hitchcock did, make each actor perform a role that was the opposite of what they have done all along.Shyamalan has, for the moment at least, decided to remain content as the modern day Hitchcock.So what if he's a one trick pony?

1023,helleberg,One of the worst-written flicks I've ever seen,1,2 August 2004,"M. Night holds true to his pattern of following a hit with a stinker (see ""Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"") with this gem. The dialogue was stilted and dead, like a bad parody of Hawthorne or Austen; the characters were caricatures; and the trademark twist was obvious a mile off and rather unsatisfying when it arrived. This movie fails as a thriller, fails as a romance, and isn't all that strenuous as an intellectual exercise.*Spoilers*I get that the ""period"" dialogue was meant to help sell the set-up, but at times it gets so bad that even the most generous viewer won't be able to help but think, ""These folks sound like they learned how to talk by reading Regency romances."" If anything, the movie would have been more convincing if the actors spoke contemporary English. This is a common liberty taken in film, where a movie is understood to be historical through setting and costume, even if language is contemporary. As a parallel, think about movies where foreign-speaking characters either 1) speak with an atrocious accent throughout to demonstrate that they're not speaking English or 2) speak in their native tongue with subtitles for a few lines, then in unaccented English throughout. However, if the filmmakers are dead-set on the period dialogue, at least it could have been done halfway decent.I get that the knifing of Lucius is ""another dang Hitchcock homage"" (henceforth, ""adHh""). A little tip of the cap to the master in the form of a little stolen slice of Psycho. Why is it that so filmmakers today think that cribbing is the best lesson that can be learned from their predecessors? The take-home lesson from Hitchcock ought to be ""innovate and surprise,"" not that ""wounding/killing the main character and focusing on a new main character is a good plot device because it worked in Psycho."" And this brings up another issue: After Ivy is becomes the new main character, why oh why would her father send his *blind* daughter into the woods, with or without guides? If the guides remain with her, then the secret of the village would be compromised as they would see the truth. If the guides turn tail, then you've got a blind girl stumbling around alone in the forest. And this for the sake of saving lives in the village?To consider the movie as an intellectual exercise, it seemed to me that the more you think about the thing, the more it unravels. For example, why on earth would these people adopt wholesale the style of the 19th century except to fool the viewing audience? Yes, as far as being a closed environment, the villagers would have to produce everything themselves which, while very ""Frontier House,"" gives absolutely no reason why they'd adopt the period speech. Aside from the Elders, everyone in the village would have been born there. The elders wouldn't have to adopt ridiculous speech patterns to fool their kids as their kids would have no real idea about the outside world, let alone the history of the outside world. Aside from Hurt, none of the other characters have any background in history. Maybe this is why we're to believe the dialogue is so bad: because everyone is trying to talk in the manner of ""Masterpiece Theater."" This leads a viewer to believe that the great farce is staged not for the youth of the village, who have no notion of nineteenth-century vs. twentieth-century idiom, but rather for the audience in the theater.To pick a final nit, why on earth was the guard shack so well equipped with first aid supplies? Most fire stations aren't so well stocked. The ""for animal bites"" explanation seems so contrived that, well, I guess the assumption was that if the viewer is still buying this, they'd swallow anything.So what's left to take home from this movie? Are we to assume that the social commentary is that Heightened Terror Threat Levels are bad? That manipulating a community through fear is detestable? If so, then why does the village carry on? Why do we get a strangely hopeful end for this isolationist village? Because protecting innocence is worth a little fear and deception? Whatever. Bad, bad, bad.",The Village
1024,matthewjonz,Questions Not Answers,9,25 August 2004,"I love this time of year - late summer, when the blockbusters start to die out, and we get back to proper movies that are not released just to sell lunch boxes. The Village made me remember why I love movies so much. I was gripped. After a summer of such boring, seen-it-before-rubbish, like ""I, Robot"", ""Van Hesling"", and ""Spider Man 2"" (or ""Spider Man Again"" as I like to call it) this was intelligent filmaking, perfectly paced, suspense fuelled, and wonderfully acted. The scene in which William Hurt has like a passionate, forceful monologue was riveting - all one take - it breathed life into my love for cinema. Shyamalan has borrowed from the right places - The Wicker Man, Don't Look Now, Dark Water, Blair Witch etc, but he is a truly gifted and individualistic filmmaker, who always takes the narrative of his films down paths I never expect. We are witnessing the work of a filmmaker on a par with Hitchcock and Spielberg; he has his own style, and whatever you say about ""THE SHYAMALAN TWIST"", very few people actually see it coming. The Sixth Sense is a classic, Unbreakable was for me his best film - by far the most thought provoking,insightful and skillful of the current cluster of Comic book movies we have witnessed over the last few years. Signs for me was a dip, but The Village was the best chiller film I've seen since The Ring.Stunning, emotive, moving, spooky, tinged with a political message, and like all great art - the viewer is left with questions not answers. It's films like this that remind me why I go to the odeon week after week.",The Village

Joaquin Phoenix and Sigourney Weaver performs good though, but that's not enough to hold the movie up!

I can forgive many things in a film, but being un-entertaining is not one of them. I don't know what's more of a mystery to me, why the studio OKed the film to be made, or that they actually went ahead and released it.

Although there are shining moments in the movie (Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning) the majority of this film is full of overwrought emotion and overly thought out scenes. Shyamalan's depiction of the importance of color is striking, as is the music that takes a prominent place in the overall feeling of the movie. The music of the film is top notch.

As usual, an observant viewer can guess Shyamalan's tells and figure out the ""twists"" within seeing the first half of this trite piece of cinema. *Spoilers* There are quite a few noticeable plot holes including the conceptual design of ""those who shall not be named"" let alone what the idea of a truce between them would suggest.

Another is the appearance of a human-made trap in the middle of supposedly deserted wood that the viewers learn is a patrolled nature preserve where there are no large animals that would be poached. These holes have been written off by many a viewer by saying Shyamalan was going for a morality tale. If this is the case he has produced a mediocre Twilight Zone episode lacking Sterling's trademark subtlety Only the superb and surprise performance of Ron Howard's daughter, Byrce Dallas Howard, makes this badly scripted morality tale worth seeing. She truly has a bright future in acting proving that not all things are genetic.",The Village
1030,moving_monkey,Liked it a lot,7,30 July 2004,"There are many among you who will complain that this movie was not scary. In response to this, I ask you to examine Shyamalan's previous movies; none of them were really scary. His movies tend to consist of creepy plots with odd twists that sometimes have a tendency of falling off at the end. He seems to me to be a very talented and intelligent writer who suffers from disorganization. I work at a movie theatre and viewed this with fellow employees and out of all who viewed the movie, was the only one who liked it. All I can say is some people like the way Shyamalan writes and some do not.And the good in this movie will just plain pass by some.",The Village
1031,CEC523,"See it, right now",9,30 July 2004,"This movie is awesome. It is most comparable to The Sixth Sense as opposed to Signs or Unbreakable. It's not for those who want to see lots of action: blood, gore, chase scenes, etc. It is more of a thinking movie. You need to pay attention and appreciate the details. The twist really is a twist, completely unexpected and it will leave you plastered to your seat, mouth hanging open, just waiting to see where it will lead. Brice Dallas Howard is a quality actress, something I really was not expecting. I thought it was all hype because she's Ron Howard's daughter, but her performance proved me wrong. I can understand why there is talk of the film being an Oscar contender. My prediction is Adrien Brody for Best Supporting Actor. I highly recommend you see it.",The Village
1032,mingusboodle,Not what you think it is,9,30 July 2004,"About half of the reviews I've read for ""The Village"" love it, while half hate it. The half that hate it seem to be disappointed that Shyamalan didn't remake ""Signs."" Who knew he could do something different? There is no plot twist at the end, as is characteristic of Shyamalan's movies. The twist, in fact, comes in the middle (for those who haven't figured it out by then). In fact, the director plays with his more loyal fans throughout the movie, leaving them clues reminiscent of past films that ultimately go nowhere. In the meantime, he slowly reveals the details and history of the mysterious village in the woods... which is what the movie is all about. All the while, the movie reflects on the problems of evil and pain, and the power of belief. The characters are wonderful, the sets are fantastic, and the plot is good for those who aren't expecting ""The Seventh Sense.""",The Village
1033,lreddy13,"2 Hours, Not 10 Minutes.",9,2 August 2004,"Seeing so many comments and posts here focusing solely on ""did you guess the twist?"", I feel the need to remind everyone that there is a whole movie here, not just an ending. I am really fascinated by this film. I think this film presents such a strong commentary on so many things... the controlling power of fear, the struggle of dealing with things we don't wish to deal with and the natural tendency to try to escape it and avoid it, the sacrifices we make without question for love, not love for yourself, but for others, the natural compassion we feel towards a stranger in need and how horribly twisted this compassion has become today, to the point where we mistrust and are afraid to take concern of anyone but ourselves, and the choices that face us when we make sacrifices to accomplish something and then must continue to make in the face of adversity to keep with what you have started, to succeed for the greater good of those you made those choices for. There's plenty of modern day significance too. There is the difference between infatuation and love, between self-preservation and life-preservation, between knowing and believing and the gripping, influential power of each. It's easy to find social commentaries on right and wrong (the interplay of speak-no-evil-Lucius, see-no-evil-Ivy, hear-no-evil-Noah), the unwavering love of parents for their mentally disturbed son, and the love and acceptance of the community for this person when we often ignore and don't bother to try to understand such people today, the political commentary on perceived fear (as one amusing reviewer put it, ""are there weapons of mass destruction in the woods?"") and on the trust and faith we put in our leaders, and conversely on the choices they make and for what reasons. And of course, there are the big questions, ""Who are we? Who should we be? Where can we go to find peace from the things that destroy us?"" If you haven't seen it, see it. Form your own opinion for sure, but I beg that you look at the film as a film and not as just a twist. Don't waste your 2 hours trying to predict the end, because whether you do predict it or you don't, that's not what it's all about. This isn't just a novelty, there is a real movie here with something to say, and it says it wonderfully. If you're waiting just for the end, you're going to miss the best stuff M. Night has to offer, which is not the twist(s). I saw someone else used this quote on watching a movie just for the surprise ending, and I feel its worth repeating because it hits the nail on the head:""It's no way to see a movie, because you're never unself-conscious enough to let the drama work on you; you're concentrated on the game. And at a certain point the whole exercise is rendered anticlimactic: The only suspense left is whether you got it right or not,"" (Stephen Hunter, Washington Post).If you see the movie, I hope you enjoy the movie and not just whether or not you got it right. Or, I hope you don't like the movie, regardless of whether or not you figured the twist out beforehand. M. Night has a tough career ahead of him. Please do your best to at least respect him enough to judge his film, and not just your predictive skills.",The Village

I love the fact that Night makes you think about what you are watching and allows your imagination to run away with it.

1036,PrenticeZarathustra,A pseudo-horror flick with philosophical underpinnings?,8,31 July 2004,"Without revealing too much, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that having just come from the theater I am astounded at the intricacy and intelligence of this film. Let me first of all state for the record that I am not a Shyamalan apostle--I very much enjoyed The Sixth Sense, but his other films (Unbreakable and Signs) I thought of much less quality. This film redeems him in my opinion as one of the more intelligent film makers in Hollywood today.There are numerous themes and metaphors (some which tremble on the threshold of being cliché, but are worked in skillfully enough by the director not to cross that line) used in the film and it would require a larger space to cover all of them. Suffice it to cover three major themes Shyamalan hits on: the state of nature, alienation and modernity, and love.Of the first, Shyamalan seems to take a page from Rousseau in his presentation of this idyllic village of closely knit people in the sense that this film captures the classically liberal theme of man's natural benevolence. Yet, this natural benevolence is contrasted with the corrupting nature of 'society' on individual human beings--forcing them into the exile we see in The Village. What Rousseau wrote about the advantages of a small republic like Geneva, for instance, are at work in the bucolic 18th century beauty of the Village. Yet, the appreciation of the lifestyle of Geneva was only appreciated by Rousseau because of his experience with the cruelties of another world--just as it is with the Elders of the Village. Yet, Shyamalan doesn't entirely embrace Rousseau, and through Brody's character (a brilliant performance by Brody, by the way) explores the possibility of evil coupled with the natural benevolence of man. In the midst of this pastoral little village, there is a philosophical quest to understand evil--both the perceived external evil of The Ones, and the internal conflicts of men.Yet, the idealism and innocence of the Village is suddenly broken in the course of Shyamalan's work by The Ones. The Village was only kept innocent by the presence of a fear they dared not challenge, and yet are they better off living in the innocence of the village then in ""the forest""? The distinctive themes of more modern philosophy are echoed in the issues of fear and the alienation that drive the Elders to their Village, themes touched on in Kierkegaard extensively. Likewise, the Elders find faith and hope for the future, and find strength in one girl's idealistic love--the love they have ever fought to keep innocent.At its heart, The Village is not a horror movie--though it has its creepy moments that are done with great taste. It is rather a love story, and its hero is a Homeric blind girl who sees more than those with vision in her town. Her journey toward love, which Shyamalan applies as a vehicle for Enlightenment, begins with wide-eyed idealism. Yet, the end of that journey offers no easy solutions. If by the end of this film you think you have a happy ending, you've missed the coming-of-age questions raised by this film.Shyamalan has produced a movie that was sold as a horror movie, but it is so much more. People's views of this movie are likely to be wildly divergent, as those who are seeking a scary movie or who believe this is a movie only about surprise endings are bound to be disappointed. But for those who are searching for an intelligent movie about the nature of man, love, and enlightenment, you will not be disappointed. You will be delighted by the philosophic intrigue of this movie, and the brilliance of the acting (although, some of the writing is too contrived in places, that we can forgive).",The Village

1038,humboldteacher,Purposefully Flaw-ridden,10,1 August 2004,"The language between the elders is contrived, in the old fashioned of ""Would I but long for the fevor of the flower""-type of old English. The creatures -are- Halloweenish. I didn't notice any of the microphone sights or anything else like that, then again...I wasn't looking for them. The movie has one glaring flaw involving a mentally challegned village patron, but I am more than happy to over-look this one flaw for the beauty of the rest of the film. Flaw-ridden...yes, contrived language, not-so-scary monsters...but the subtle-savy understand exactly WHY these flaws were made, and the exact ART that was involved with the risk...at the end of the movie. The use of color is -amazing-, but there is a re-occurring question on the part of Ivy to Lucius that is never answered. The violence involved is nothing short of beautiful poetry. Actors take you into the heart of the movie's eerie forlorn tone and hold you there...and the ending scene, while minorly frustrating, leaves you feeling as if they haven't let go. However, Mr. Shyamalan gives us credit of imagination...and by not giving us an ""alls well that ends well"" gives the audience a credit of intelligence. I felt as if he was saying ""You know what happens, no use in wasting your time."" AND the HUGE importance of ""let down"" last scene that was mentioned...you do sit and go...""What tha?""...but later I appreciated the tension, and was glad that the movie didn't ""end"" traditionally...because to me...the character's didn't end. Though, I must admit...I guessed the ending very close to the beginning of the movie...but I think any director, writer, producer that is KNOWN for twists...well, that sometimes it's easy to expect the unexpected.Bottom line, it takes a savy palate to enjoy this film, it's full of intelligent humor and smart terror that plays perfectly on the big screen.",The Village

Later, in the ranger station as Kevin speaks to his boss (M Night) and the final elements of the wildlife preserve story play out, M Night continually opens and closes a newspaper. In the right-hand corner of the newspaper, we keep seeing this article stating that a 7-year old boy has been kidnapped and has been missing for X amount of days. So, simply stated, are these related? If so, doesn't that add a very sinister element to the story and perhaps, that is why MNS is smirking ever so slightly as he reads the newspaper. I wouldn't think of it at all, except that he opens the damn paper 4 or 5 times and that article is also in the foreground of the shot as Kevin sneaks Ivy's medicine.

Shyamalan disappoints the viewers with this Twilight-Zone(istic) television story line. For the first twenty or so minutes we all waited for the story to build up under the Shyamalan steam. In the scene where the ""creature"" breaks the barrier, the entire movie theater viewers take a jump towards anticipation, similar to Shyamalan's first creature sightings in ""Signs"". Then the theater started to snooze. The story line was so weak, I couldn't wait for a commercial break. At least the Twilight Zone could have wrapped this up in under 30 minutes (with commercials!)

If you're looking for a smart and superb ending, forget this movie, watch the Other or tale of two sister. I really regret waiting almost 90 minutes, hoping Shyamalan would thrill me again with ending brilliance a-la 6th sense, only to discover he should switch career to TV! Village's conclusion is the worst element, anticlimax-ly disappointing. I might still give this movie a 6 if the ending is smart. The only reason I gave this movie 3 instead of 1 was the only one exciting scene when the villagers sheltering for the attack of 'the not suppose to be mentioned creature"". Other than that, zzzzz. Shyamalan definitely should stop making 6th sense wanna be, before his credibility burns out completely.",The Village

All the story is definitely boring and predictable. Good acting, but it is just a waste of good actors.

The village layout, buildings, etc., were extremely well done--very beautiful. The bizarro violin music was very well done. In terms of cinematography and such, this was a very well-crafted film.My wife and I saw this film in an almost empty theatre on August 19--very unusual since the Megaplex where we went is usually packed out! I think it was a commentary on this film!Around 15 minutes into this film, and not knowing what the film was about, my wife leaned over to me and said, ""now watch, the twist is probably something like it's really modern times, and this village is really next to a freeway or something."" Although I I wasn't sure that she was right, I kept waiting in the film to see how the ""twist"" would be executed. Since our first sighting of the ""monsters"" was so obvious that ""they"" were just people dressed in red capes with stuff on them, I thought that maybe the twist would be that, although the ""monsters"" were fake,there would actually turn out to be real monsters. I had hoped for something more imaginative than what my wife suggested, and was a bit disappointed when she was basically right. I was confused though. The photo showed all of the ""elders"" standing in 70's-era clothes in front of a ""Counseling Center."" Were they all mental patients? Were they the counselors? Were they criminals who themselves killed all the people mentioned on the voice-over when they went through whom in their families were dead and how they died?

I don't want to give away too much of it, so I'll just say I'm glad that the producer kept it in reality, but at the same time I'm alittle upset that he did just that. Go see this movie and you'll understand why I say that. It had a twisted ending which is good, who doesn't like endings like that?

(and at fifth I am being generous) Just like his other films, the cinematography is excellent. Unfortunately, just like his other films, there are plot holes big enough to drive a truck through! Shyamalan treats his audience like idiots who haven't the capacity to reason. (and judging from many of the comments they do suffer from this) I thought the stupidity reached a high point in Signs. (Think people-aliens to whom water is poisonous invade a planet that's 80% water?!!! Not to mention that star spanning aliens can easily be kept at bay with a sack or two of seeds??!!!) The Village follows in Shyamalan's typical dark foreboding style, and like the others creates so many incredibly dumb moments, that you are so busy going over the sheer idiocy of events and characters in your head, that you fail to notice much when the movie fizzles out.

This was true to Night's other movies in it's vision and attention to detail. It was different however in that he wasn't going for the ""shocker ending"". The ending was to me just part of the story. There were tense moments, monsters, and perhaps events one did not see coming... however- the conclusion was only what the people in the film were running from: that violence had touched them where they thought it would not. That you cannot control your environment to that degree and that bad things can and will happen ""where you live"". You can however choose to be brave in the face of it to help someone who needs it; to be an unsung hero if you will. That's it- simplified of course.

1050,philip-bunnell,The emperor has no clothes...,1,23 August 2004,"I've been a fan of the reviews on IMDb for many years BUT only now do I feel the urge to put my own views down. After going to see 'The Village' at the weekend, I feel the need to warn others not to waste their hard-earned cash on a load of utter self-indulgent rubbish... So naturally **** SPOILER ALERT ****Why the hard line? Well director M. Night Shyamalan has, as other reviewers have noted, a lot to live up to because of his earlier films, such as Signs and The Sixth Sense, which were are all very good. His direction, casting choices and good scripts has turned old genres into real winners, both in style and ticket receipts. But those films, or what made them enjoyable for me, was the unexpected but plausible twists (within the context of the story). Sadly though, Shyamalan has now got his formula and The Village just tries too hard to follow in the others footsteps. Despite strong performances from the leads Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenixm it does little to improve the general crapiness of it all.Forget the good cinematography, a few bits of impressive screen dialogue, the on-screen chemistry between the two leads, the sharp editing, you're there to see an M. Night Shyamalan film because it won't fit the usual bill. But that's where it all falls down as the film is a turkey because the twist is Shyamalan's attempt to preach a message about unwarranted fear and the need for hope and a quest to fulfill one self. The Village, you see is kept held together (and insular) through fear of the 'monsters in the wood'. This has been going on for years but like Friedrich Nietzsche warned, those who battle 'with monsters had better see that it does not turn him into a monster'. And this is basically the whole premise of the film which results in the killing of the animals and the stabbing.It seems to me that Shyamalan started the script at the end and then worked his way back to the beginning. Viz - finale and answer to whole film, but to do this you must create reason why people must leave village, but to do this you need to build tension because monsters threaten village as there are monsters in the wood. But the process insults the intelligence of the audience (well it did for me) because you get incredulous plot holes. For example, its 19th century America and there are 'monsters in the woods' - so where are the guns? Right to bare arms etc ? (Sic Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow). I mean if settlers shot millions of buffalo into extinction surely these pioneers could deal with a couple of slow-moving, red-cape wearing wart hogs? Next was it a budgetry thing, (couldn't they afford a wooden one) but what the hell was an aluminium green house doing in the 1890s.? It was only 10 years after the Bayer process was developed in Austria, what an anachronism..!! Planes...although a reason is given at the end of the film. What about microlights, private pleasure craft, hot air balloons etc. I'm sorry there is no where on this planet that is not free from aerial snooping. E.g. Area 51 is not meant to exist but I bet there are more images on the internet of this site than the White House..!! Same goes for people just climbing the fence. Hey maybe that's the sequel The Village: The Donner Experience...yep really cold winter, kids in a car lose control crash through the fence and stumble on them hungry locals... It might be more entertaining.So after 100 minutes you get to the end of the day the film, and you learn that the premise - that as long as fear is used to control there can be no hope, no matter how liberal a lifestyle.I am therefore sorry M. Night Shyamalan you have lost the plot this time.I am therefore sorry that after so many good films this one is so bad.I am also sorry that I can't have my £6 back after being told the bl**ding obvious and in a really dumb way.M. Night Shyamalan please watch Soylent Green to learnt the answers...",The Village
1051,jimlogie,Refreshing and Thought Provoking. Spoiler Warning,9,24 August 2004,"What a refreshing change this film made. I watched The village this afternoon at a local cinema with a predominantly young audience and everyone in the theatre seemed to enjoy the whole experience. I for one was pleasantly surprised by how different the film turned out in comparison to Night's previous efforts. I recently found out that the director is a Twilight Zone fan and the influences are there to be seen but executed wonderfully. The acting was great and I am all for a good love story especially in these settings and the leads play it very convincingly. A few critics have noted that the film could have been shorter, maybe they feel the story could have fit into a twilight zone episode but i totally disagree. If anything Twilight Zone episodes were too short and rushed due mainly to the constrictions of television. The photography was superb and the suspense was terrific. This movie made a wonderful change from the regular popcorn pulp that is churned out with the added bonus of no CGI. It was a brave move by the director to take the film in a different direction this time round and i salute him, if only other film makers would take more risks, well done sir. Long may these films continue.",The Village
1052,albastra,"A beautiful movie, advertised as a horror and subsequently underrated",9,10 September 2004,"The Village is a good movie, and unfortunately many people went to see it expecting a horror and wanting hard to get scared. The idea was interesting, it was beautifully filmed, and the actors had an excellent performance. What more? It's maybe not a major movie, but a pretty good one.SPOILER A wave of disappointment over the lack of abundantly salivating aliens, or mythical monsters, or unnamed ghosts that should populate the woods around the village provoked an unleashed flow of testosterone and aggressivity over the movie and the ones who happened to like it. It's incredible one can read on the front page commentaries full of advices - ""go see a doctor"" and alike.Well, this is the power of prejudice, and intelligent people should have the power to get over it and appreciate this movie for what it is. Another disappointment was : ""I got the plot from the beginning"" and the unexpected conclusion - ""the movie was stupid"". Aren't we a bit underestimating ourselves in this case? Foreseeing the twists could mean - maybe, just maybe, that WE are not stupid. Not foreseeing meaning absolutely nothing. A regrettable lack of tolerance and flexibility...What these furious and negative little comments seem to forget is the message - yes, some movies have ideas and messages - others have the scare between two mouthfuls of popcorn.What i understood was : one cannot make a perfect society. That no matter how one protects it from outside - finally the evil will come from within. What was maybe a flaw (and probably not the only one) was who and what the 'evil' was.No, I will not seek doctor advice because some scenes frightened me. Instead, i am quite happy that against my expectations, i could appreciate this movie for what it is NOT.",The Village
1053,mdace9889,One of the best stories I have ever seen,9,20 January 2005,"Simply a masterpiece! This film adds an element of a spooky background and a mind blowing ending. While not your typical scary movie this story slowly builds into a carnival of suspense. Very underrated by the movie critics, this film gave me appreciation for something that is usually looked over in scary movies....THE STORY. This film had it all, great acting, great story, and a unbelievable ending. I walked away from this movie spellbound by the simple formula that M.Night used to create a world of shadows, hope, and courage. The story not only brought out the childhood fear of the bogyman but also the courage it takes to look under the bed to face your fears. Do yourself a favor and rent this movie.",The Village

1055,adicrot,"Shyamalan, you went back... (to good film making)",10,26 September 2004,"What a surprise!.After watching the awful Signs movie I told myself I would never go to watch any other Shyamalan movies. It was a pity because I thought Shyamalan was very talented but movies went more and more bad since The Sixth Sense.So, when The Village started in USA I read the bad critics from everyone and I supposed it was really a bad movie... just what I was thinking.... no surprises.BUT!, the story sounded so good I couldn't resist. This Friday the movie started in Spain (amazing translation for the movie title...., ""El Bosque"" (which means ""The Forest"")) and two days later, there I was.... prepared for a really poor movie......but this is the best crafted movie by Shyamalan. From the technical perspective, camera use, photography, music, everything is absolutely perfect. The slow motion of the movie is something I really appreciate in this times of mindless-fast-pace-stupid-movies... so for the first 15 minutes I was just amazed with the photography, music, and the almost fairytale mood of the movie.Then it goes better and better, as everyone realizes the truth behind the village. I think the important part is not the typical signature final surprise of the movie (every Shyamalan movie has a final trick). In this case the real chilling comes much sooner the end of the movie.To get the real beauty of this film you have to dig deep in the story. Lots of similar things are happening just in your world today so it's amazing how MNS ""translated"" the essence of contemporary problems (specially in the USA and their current politicians) to a fairy tale kind of story.I also like the almost independent European style of the film... the way every scene has been shot.The bad point is the advertising campaign in Spain.... in the trailer it seems you're going to see a really scary terror movie. Of course this was not the intention of the director, but the only rule of distributors is to earn more and more money, and everything is valid for them. That means lots of disappointed people at the end of the movie...Happily (for me), the movie was not what I was expecting, it's much more beautiful!!!!!!!.Well done Mr. Shyamalan.

1057,cherry_pop_siskel,Pillage the Village.,3,17 January 2005,"Here's a concept: A bunch of people live in a creepy village located in the middle of a field in anywhere, anytime, North America. Within this bunch of people reside a retarded murderous pianist, a blind woman who can see, and a ring leader that talks like a robotic Dickens novel. Everyone dresses all Amish. Surrounding the village is a forbidden forest, where ""Those We Don't Speak Of,"" (glorified dark crystal beasts,) run amok, slaughtering and skinning dogs, leaving their glistening corpses on villagers doorsteps, all sinister-like. Sounds cool right? No. Not cool. There is a cornucopia of reasons why you, your friends, or their friends should not waste their valuable time on this piece of utter disappointment. Let's just start with the logistics. How many torches surround the village? These flames burn eternally? Who lights said torches? If the woods are off limits, where does all the wood come from? Who built these houses? What worm hole does the food, 80 foot banquet tables and fine linen materialize from? Is this the very same wormhole that the script appeared from when it landed on M. Night's desk? Why didn't he throw it back, or ask Steven Hawkins for a second opinion. As if the absurd logistics aren't enough to bury this film, dialog so weak it could make the pope weep is coupled with less then savory performances from seemingly qualified actors. The Village makes Unbreakable look good... hold on... I think I'm going to... yes, I'm going to throw up.This film put the ""uck"" in suck. -Cherry ""Pop"" Siskel",The Village

First it's Alien creatures and Mysterious Crop circles with compelling, and complex human stories underlying a broadly supernatural, extraterrestrial, or otherwise, other-worldly background. Now it's Monstrous Creatures in the woods around an idyllic village of innocents, great story. In these days of so much wasted film, his efforts are most welcome, and his choice of actors and what he brings out of them is most incredible, which brings me to...Miss Bryce Dallas Howard; it's been a long time since I've seen a young woman with so much charm and screen appeal. After her outstanding performance in this fine film, she has surely set her path as a most lovely and very capable leading lady. Ron Howard (Daddy, to those of you who didn't know) has to be very proud. I was spellbound by her performance from the first scene she appeared in, and think she stole the show.",The Village

Was able to go with others who normally skip the scaries because they don't like gore. Similar to hearing a scary story as a child. You don't have to see gore to be afraid.

However you need to look at this film quite differently than any other. What you need you need to see is why the director has done certain things. For example the use of Red is prominent as seen in Sixth sense. Also when you first saw it you needed to allow the trailers and adverts become part of the film, and how the different the film was to the trailer.

I found it tiresome and predictable. In other words I saw it coming from the first reel, and you can imagine how peed off I felt by the time it crawled towards the denouement. The Village though never set out to be a scary movie - in my books- but works well as tender, elegiac mystery story..a beautiful psychological thriller. I loved the acting, the atmosphere, which was well sustained, the meta-dialogue, the costumes, and even the gentle and still believable conceit - billionaire creates make believe world because etc.Baba you hit the nail on the head when you say its the horror fans who are disappointed.

1063,rodney-culling,"Simple On One Level, Complex And Thought Provoking On Another",8,19 February 2005,"Having just watched The Village on DVD I found it to be a good movie beautifully shot and scored. On the surface the plot is extremely simple, a tight knit community living in a village surrounded by woods containing evil creatures. Underneath the plot is about how far people will go to prevent themselves and others from experiencing painful moments in life. Rather than risk repeating what others have already written, I thought I'd just add the following.Two points made by the director in the bonus material on the DVD stood out for me. Firstly, when making the movie there was a point when it was really scary, but a decision was made two thirds through the scoring process to go for emotion and make it a romance. Although the movie does have a number of jump points that are fairly scary, it is essentially a love story. People expecting a horror flick are likely to be disappointed. Secondly, when the original creatures were scaled up in size from being models, they just didn't move in a realistic fashion or have the desired affect. Consequently the design was changed which to me resulted in creatures that were too similar in proportion to the villagers. This made me wonder why two or three of the more able villagers couldn't just see the creatures off with shovels or any other implements readily available.The odd niggle aside though, I found it to be an enjoyable and enchanting film containing the director's trademark plot twists. I'd give it 8/10.",The Village
1064,scout1621,Awful,1,29 December 2004,"I went to see this movie with a lot of expectations. It was very slow and the disappointing ending couldn't come fast enough. The previous movies by this director, with the exception of Unbreakable, were supernatural and gripping. They kept you on the edge of your seat and you didn't see the end of the Sixth Sense until it had hit you in the face. But The Village? No supernatural as the previews elude to and all of those wonderful actors have put a smudge on their resumes. Sigourney Weaver, William Hurt, Adrien Brody. Need I go on?

Because of my busy schedule that summer, I didn't have the time to go see The Village. When I did have that spare moment, I didn't bother to go see it because the majority of my friends said it was crap and a waste of money.Just a few weeks ago this movie came out to rent on DVD. Looking somewhat forward to renting it, my friend spoiled the enormous twist at the end just to prove it was a stupid movie. About a week later, I went to the movie store looking forward to renting a comedy, but ended up getting the Village. I wasn't expecting it to be so good.I think that most people didn't enjoy this movie because the twist was disappointed, but since it was spoiled for me, I found absolutely wonderful! Besides the Notebook, the Village is now my all-time favourite movie. It captured my attention from the first title on the screen, to the very last.I'm really upset that none of the actors got an Oscar nod; especially the actor who plays Ivy Walker. Another element of this movie that was amazing was the music.I think this movie is underrated and deserves a 9/10. It is worth seeing. I don't think movies get much better than this.",The Village
1066,insolit,Poor story!,1,15 December 2004,"It's really hard for me to find out, what's so special about this movie. There's nothing new about the plot... even in Big Fish we can find something allusive to the idea of people isolated from the rest of the society, expecting to get the perfect life.. The love story is not intense... there isn't any reason to get scared... But worst of all... really predictable... On opposite to the 3 other movies from this director, we can easily and very soon predict, what's supposed to be the great mystery of the story. By the way, i think these director's movies are decreasing in quality. Sixth sense was great, one of the best movies i've ever seen, with a huge impact. Unbreakable was also good... but not the same thing... These last two, Signs and now Village... but mainly village... are bad movies in my point of view. Well that's all i have to say...

The script was well written, and the plot did not ""bog down"" as it can with some thrillers. Thriller, maybe. But, definitely not a horror film.There was some of the same fore-shadowing in The Village as The 6th Sense, but the suspense was not as alluring. Perhaps that was the intent. The film's punch line, or message, is poignant. You'll have to see it for yourself to see if the grand conclusion stirs your own value system or not.The people depicted in The Village closely resemble a real socio-religious group. I did not care for the way they are depicted in the film. In fact, the film would not have a foundation if it weren't for that characterization.",The Village

Its just like if you missed the very first 5 minutes. And it takes a while till things become more interesting and in the meantime you think that its not worth watching. But after a while things change, a concrete story with an emotional background evolves and you get more and more interested and involved in the movie. And the end has such a surprising element like The 6th Sense - seems to be a trademark of the writer.So, all in all its really a stunning motion picture - not really frightening but thrilling.

1070,roundman,"M. Night Shyamalan, what went wrong?",4,15 July 2006,"A while ago, i watched ""The sixth sense"" on TV. It was the first time that i ever watched an m. night shyamalan movie, and, being a pansy, i turned it off after i saw the people hanging in the hallway. And yet, i was still intrigued. I loved the masterful storytelling, intricate plot, and great acting. Then, i watched signs on TV. Once again, i loved it!!! Signs has a great plot with a neat twist ending, and i also loved how everything had a purpose and came together in the end. By then, i had fallen in love with Mr. Shyamalan and rented ""Unbreakable"". Not as good as the last two, but still Extremeley enjoyable!!Then i rented the village. From the first scene (which happens to be of a funeral), i could tell that this was not going to be great. Adrean Brody and Joaquin Pheonix's parts are both dull and boring. Hell, i couldn't even tell that the blind girl was blind for about the first 15 minutes Then there was the ""monsters"" who lived in the woods. When i saw the marks on the doors, i felt that those could be used for something really creepy, but, alas, i was wrong. The monster costumes were so garish i felt like i was watching scooby-doo. I basically had lost all hope for the movie by then.Then, Joaquin Pheonix's character is Horribly injured, for no reason other then to get the plot (or lack there of) moving. Bryce Dallas Howard's character then goes off into the woods, where she is chased around by adrean brody (in a full body monster suit) until she kills him. She also meets with some really weird things (a gaping hole in the ground, a tree with bottles attached), and yet nothing much happens. Bryce Dallas Howard basically walks by them.Then, we meet the twist ending, and herein lies the spoilers.So, we return to the village, where they bring back up the concept of the ""Forbidden Box"" Which they BARELEY mentioned at all before, and we learn the truth. The village is actually just a group of people who suffered trauma who wanted to escape from modern life. Wow. So scary isn't it? And then, We expect the movie the movie to have about 5 more minutes. But noooo, we then watch intently for another 20 minutes as boring people get medicine (boringly) and Bryce Dallas Howard makes her long trip home. Some stuff i forgot to mention was M. Night's Trademark use of color, but unfortunately, one of the colors was a grotesque yellow. Bleh.By the end, this movie had CRAPPY acting, A CRAPPY plot, CRAPPY writing and a CRAPPY twist.I hope that ""Lady in the water"" will redeem M. Night Shyamalan, and even though it has Bryce Dallas Howard (who i hope is a lot better now), it also has paul giamatti, who is a GREAT actor who i LOVED in American Splendor and Cinderrella man. And there you have it folks, a blow by blow of the worst M. Night Shyamalan so far. But, i always give people second chances, and i still love his other movies, so, i still respect him.

It is a beautifully done story, that can be classified in many genres- phsycological thriller, romance, drama, etc. The story is so clever. And the music is just as beautiful as the movie, and I wish very much that it had won at the Oscars. I bought the soundtrack.

1072,my_name_is_aoshi_of_the_oniwaban,Audiences don't get it (its not about creatures in the woods),10,28 February 2005,"Haven't you noticed all of the reviews that don't like this movie are always the ones that sound like--""OMG THIS MOVIE Like Totally SUX!!1""--That's because modern audiences aren't intelligent enough to understand artistic film. We're all too busy watching mindless violent and utterly stupid movies. Audiences don't understand, this movie is not about creatures in the woods. And if you don't like that, then I am by no means saying you don't have the right to dislike this movie--that's simply your personal view--but to say it ""sucks"" is not fair whatsoever.While I'll admit this movie was marketed differently than it should have been, we were expecting horror and got drama. We went to see The Village expecting a ""OMG THIS IS Like The MOST AWESOMNESS TWISTY ENDING EVAR"" instead of investing time in the characters and reaching the deep center of The Village.I'll start by saying The Sixth Sense and Signs are not about ghosts or aliens, just as this is not about 'creatures in the woods'. These are what film enthusiasts refer to as metaphors. The Village is one of the, as well as bravest, most metaphorical films of our time. Whether or not it was 'scary' isn't important now is it. I think it's fine if your disappointed about it not being scary, as matter of fact it's what kept it from getting a 10 from me, but The Village isn't meant to be horror. The 'bad color' clearly represents blood and violence, the villagers traveled to their obscure area to escape this. That is why the 'bad color' is not allowed, it attracts 'those we don't speak of' which represents the people of the towns. That's why they are located in the surrounding woods.Audiences do not pick up on this anymore because, frankly, we're stupid. We're issued pure crap on a daily basis and come to find it the norm.Now, about that supposedly so important twist ending. I won't give anything away (like you really care, the rest of the movie means nothing to you, hypocrite) but I would like to state that the twist ending is very clever and while it may not bowl you over, like The Sixth Sense's ending did, it will surprise you and don't lie to yourself and say 'you knew all along'. Look at some of the reviews that say this movie ""SUXXORS The BIG ONE!!11"", all of them are from ignorant twelve-year olds, or ones with the mentality of a twelve-year old, who claim to be such 'movie bufs'. The twist ending only solidifies the rest of the story, which is about something more than a village surrounded by woods infested with monsters.The movie uses something called symbolism, which is something modern audiences don't get. ""The Bad Color"", ""The Creatures in the Woods"", ""Those We Don't Speak Of"", these are metaphors. The Village is really about innocence. The Villagers were afraid of these monsters because, due to their innocence, they didn't know much about them. Fear and innocence are powerful messages that very few movies express today.I wonder what would happen if The Village had come out after The Sixth Sense. Would your opinion be different? I grant it would be. Stop comparing different movies with each other because their directed by the same man. When you go see a movie take the time to invest your time in the characters and let the story unfold before your eyes and maybe you'll enjoy more movies and maybe be able to actually say you understand film. If in the end you didn't like The Village , that is your opinion, but to go around saying ""THIS IS Like The WURST MOVI EVAR MADE Like OMG!!!oneoneone"" is simply showing your ignorance.I wrote this to possibly shed some light on what The Village is really about. I'm not saying you have to like it, but the reason no one liked it is because no one understood it. If you got the innuendos and symbolisms and simply didn't like it, I don't find you a hypocrite. It's those that go around saying ""TEH TWWIST ENDIN IS GAY"" that shouldn't even be allowed to watch movies like this, movies with a point.Good cinema is rare, but a good audience is an endangered species.",The Village

The movie wasn't scary but startling. The movie however like the others done by M. Night Shyamalan made you think: Could this be true? The weirdest parts in my opnioin were:1. When Ivy stepped over the wall and there was the cars 2. The dead animals 3. When Noah took the suit and attacked Ivy.One this I didn't understand is why in the beginning the gravestone said that the person who died, died sometime in the 1800s. The people who lived there regardless, excluding the elders, wouldn't have known if it was the 1894 or 3094. This probably was added just to keep the viewers in suspense.

I guess that's my trademark or one of them anyway!"". It's as precise and intelligent a comment as his films: he knows exactly what he is doing. ""The Village"" is an entertaining version (a ""B-film"") of Lars Von Trier ""Dogville"" (an ""A-film""), but no less an insight in great depth of American society and the manipulative powers that shape its phobias.

From what I gathered from the bonus features and commentaries, this story was basically several ideas all thrown together with no rhyme or reason. It's a love story....no wait it's a horror....no wait it's a historical piece.

However, even in this area I ended up nodding my head at the accuracy of his thoughts as to why they were deleted. This includes the final woods scene that I thought had a LOT going for it.

Now, for fans of the film Signs, this film may be disappointing, mainly because it IS NOT A SCARY MOVIE. Nor was it intended to be. This film was a romance. This should not have to be explained, and if you didn't notice it, then you should retract our original statement about this film. The story is purely that, a romance. There are two more themes in the film which should not be overlooked. First, the preservation of innocence. The elders of the village were trying to protect the innocence of their offspring, that was their excuse for taking them to the woods. The Seconed, the idea that the elders had of not taking any evil with them. Their flaw was the village ""fool"" Noah. He was infatuated with the idea of violent creatures in the woods, and this was the root that poisoned the village. Basically, I would have to call all critics that rated this film as a poor effort, extremely pig-headed and inexperienced in reviewing movies. I am a film student, and i would highly recommend this film to any students or teachers to teach and/or study this film for story lessons, and beautiful directing. So overall i give this film 9 out of 10 and i consider it one of the greater films of Shyamalan's library.",The Village
1080,drchriswalker,Village Idiot,3,19 June 2005,"This film started out very creepy. the setup was great, but then they broke the #1 rule of scary: If you show the monster in broad-day-light it is no longer scary. Fury monsters are not scary to start with, let alone when we have already seen it in the sunshine. So from then on I didn't care about the characters or story at all. It just became annoying as it was all so obvious what was going to happen. Oh and my god why would they keep the costume under the floor in the room where they put the naughty people? Is that the safest place they could think of in a whole village? By the end we were all just groaning at the lame plot and hoped it would all end quickly. the twist in sixth sense worked because it was a surprise, this one did not work because they spoiled the surprise by showing the sesame street monster. So to sum up: Great start, Bad middle and Disgusting pointless end.I do feel for M. Night Shyamalan though, as his early film Sixth Sense was so brilliant, it will be almost impossible to top it.",The Village

It was advertised as a much different movie than it is. If you expected the horror it seemed it would be during the previews this will be a huge let down for you. If you are looking for a movie that might possibly portray the way many in society feel of seeking ""Euphoria"" then this is the movie for you. But don't expect that ""euphoria"" is a true status because the ""sins"" of society will eventually find you no matter where you are.I have seen mixed reviews on this movie but generally the consensus I have heard and read is that it is simply a rotten movie and a true waste of a couple good hours.",The Village
1083,guinnberger-1,*May Contain Spoilers*,9,11 July 2006,"Very enjoyable film, which surprised me because I had heard a fair bit of negative comment about it, and already knew the ""punch-line"" prior to viewing. The whole thing sounded silly and pointless, before I'd actually seen the story.But it isn't just a ""Shock Theater"" episode, and it isn't about the ending. It's a very thoughtful study of human nature. The language is stiffly formal for most of the film, but that's a deliberate thing, part of what the community of the Village was founded to accomplish.Every performance in the film is beautiful and compelling, especially Bryce Dallas Howard's much-talked about luminous portrayal of the blind - but very perceptive - Ivy. Adrien Brody as Noah is equally amazing, and aside from those two, it's hard to say anything but ""WOW"" about the cast. There was nothing but good acting throughout, and every contributor to the ensemble grabbed my attention whenever he or she had a line or a bit of ""business."" It truly can be described as an all-star cast.What struck me most about the film, though, was how it portrayed the mechanics of fear, and how that emotion is used to control people, in the ""Towns"" - the outside world the villagers shun with such dread - and in the Village itself. There are indeed monsters, and the people of the Village try heroically to escape them, but there is no escape. There's a quote from the comic strip ""Pogo"": ""We has seen the enemy, and they is us."" (I think that's how it goes.) Human beings can never escape the monsters that threaten and terrify us, because we carry them with us wherever we go: they are us. That's the message I got, and it was delivered in an evocative, subtle way that made the film quite a treat for me.",The Village

I find it a great shame that some great directors don't get much work and people like M. night and the likes of the much over rated Eli Roth continue to make films. Oh, has Mr Shyamalan heard of planes or satellites? All in all, another extremely dull, pointless movie from M, with no genuine suspense, even at the 'suprise twist' ending that he seems to believe makes his movies so clever. Not even rescuable by the top notch cast, who fail to make M's useless dialogue sound believable. I could have written better whilst I was at school, frankly.",The Village

But it couldn't have been scarier! i thought the acting was great the story was predictable yet entertaining. i like watching movies in the dark but i actually had to watch this one with the light on.Adrian Brody, as always, was amazing and i was pleasantly surprised with Bryce Dallas Howard's performance (it was slightly stilted at the beginning but as the film progressed it grew on me).If you don't truly appreciate film i say you'd be better off with scream or the ring. but for those of you who can look deeper- THE VILLAGE is 'wet ya pants' scary!!!",The Village

I find myself thinking about the film industry. Thats always a bad sign, because it happens when you recognize the film making process.But as the story evolves I find myself more into the film, especially after Luscious met Ivy. From then on there is a thread you can follow. Especially with good actors at work that a good think.It seems pretty hard to do a horror movie these days.. The horror factor is low all the way through. Ivy even when she knows whats going on, still somehow believes in those creatures, that doesn't even exist. The end is a little to short for my taste..

Not to mention that expectations had spiraled out of control for M Night given his earlier success when released.When people go into a movie immediately trying to solve what the big reveal is going to be based on the directors history, they ultimately end up robbing themselves of a satisfying movie experience.Creepy, visually beautiful, wonderful score, professional acting performances, and a thought provoking conclusion make this a very entertaining film.",The Village

It had so many plot twists that you would almost expect to get lost but the thread never came unwoven. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that really likes to be taken by surprise by an unexpected ending. My husband can usually figure out what's going to happen next but this one even kept him guessing. I highly recommend this movie! I've never had a movie that had such a mixture of confusion, fright, emotion and then total shock like this one did. It's an absolutely incredible movie!",The Village
1090,hangovers,One of the finest films of 2004. People who watched for the twist missed the important message.,10,16 July 2005,"This was easily one of the finest films of 2004. When I saw it in the theater, I didn't guess the twist until it was right before my eyes. But with that aside, this film has a very powerful social message, which M. Night was going for. Its disappointing to hear people hated this film because it wasn't scary enough for them or the twist was too easy to guess. Those people are ignorant and bypassed one of the most powerful films of the year. And besides, the acting was magnificent. Bryce Dallas Howard, I must say, gave an Oscar- worthy performance. She is extremely talented and turned her role of Ivy into someone you can sympathize with and cry for. She gave enough to her character that nobody would leave the theater saying ""Ivy was obnoxious"", she was simply amazing. Each scene was so beautifully crafted and photographed that every one seemed like a Vermeer painting, if this film had come out closer to Oscar time, it would have probably nabbed nods for Art Direction, Cinematography and Costume Design. Overall, The Village is a powerful work of art that should not be ignorantly overlooked. I bought it on DVD the day it came out.",The Village

In the tradition of 'Signs' this director continues to offend the sensibilities of any thinking person. Lackluster performances by the famous cast may have been due to the stilted and lame dialog or to the silly and predictable plot, but either way they all should have stayed away from this expensive debacle. The blind girl was really pretty, at least;)This movie was disgracefully marketed as one of Hollywood's best psychological thrillers, ranking with the best of Hitchcock!!!

1092,bragadeesh-08294,M Night Shyamalan does it again,9,24 May 2020,"Amazing. 9/10A unique horror thriller by M Night Shyamalan that takes you through an unexpected journey. With a strong plot, interesting characters, the movie leaves you with important questions worth pondering upon.Spoilers ahead
What seems to be a horror thriller, suddenly turns into a drama exploring hope and nature of humanity.We start the movie in an isolated village that faces a threat from creatures living in nearby woods. For some reason, there is a pact between villagers and creatures that forbits anyone from entering the woods. Lucius asks permission from ""elders"" ,or heads of the village including Mr. Walker, seemingly patriarch of the village to cross the woods and fetch medicine to save the village from prevailing infection.Meanwhile, the creatures raid the village, remove the skin of lifestock and display signs to warn the village.We see a romatic affair developing between Walker's blind daughter Iva and Lucius and they plan to marry. Out of jealousy, Ava's close friend, mentally ill Noah stabs Lucius multiple times, seemingly of jealousy.When Ava, asks her father to fetch medicines from nearby town, we learn that the story of creatures is a hoax created by elders, based on a real rumour. The elders dressed up as creatures to scare the other villagers. The elders were victims of violent crime and they decided to start the village as a experiment project to be isolated from society.Walker faces a moral dilemma and allows his daughter to go through the woods, as the entire exercise is pointless if future generation including Lucius don't get to live. Overcoming various hurdles, including unknowingly killing Noah dressed as creature, Ava succeeds in her mission. Ava based on her encounter believes the existence of creatures to keep the story going for future generations.M Night Shyamalan leads us to question humanity and whether or not we have engineered a decent society.Are we the humans, the real creatures about who we must not speak of?
Is living in ""The village"" better than urban lifestyle?
Is crime and greed too much of a problem in current society that we should consider stepping back to older civilisations?
Is it acceptable to lie to an entire society in pursuit of greater good?
Is happiness and purpose more important than truth?These are questions worth exploring.A very strong plot. Interesting twists. Compelling story line to keep you hooked in the movie. Good screenplay. 9/10.",The Village
1093,abrnavarro,This film deserves a higher score,9,20 July 2016,"I thought the introduction, middle, and ending of this movie was excellent. M Night creates unique horror movies that are not just blood and gore. The ending made sense with the plot and direction of the film because when I first saw the movie, I noticed that the living quarters of the characters seemed very new. If you re-watch the film, you will see how the village homes are polished and don't looks like rustic log cabins. The ending was a strong point of the film because it makes sense how people who experienced violent crimes or lost loved ones in real life would want to create their own utopia.I think this movie has a strong political and spiritual message: People do not change. This movie also reminds of the Twilight episode called ""Looks Just Like You."" In this episode, the men and women undergo cosmetic surgery to turn into the ideal male and female standards of health and beauty. Although this utopia is created through physical improvement, M Night's is achieved by shunning modern technology.",The Village

I was proved completely wrong.Lucius Hunt (Phoenix) is a quiet man living in a small village, surrounded by a beautiful and mysterious wood. The people of the village have been told by the village elders that strange creatures live withing the woods, and they have a pact - They won't come into our village if we don't go into their woods. Lucius is determined to find out about these creatures, and crosses the forbidden boarder into the woods. There is an immediate sense that these creatures are coming... and coming fast. Ivy Walker (Howard) is a blind girl who also resides in the village. Just a curious as Lucius, she ends up trapped in the middle of a horror that only very few know about...I have to admit that this movie had some very good and gripping scenes. But the final conclusion is an enormous cheat, and completely ruins the whole tension. Watch this if you are prepared to be disappointed.",The Village

1097,stabbingstacy,Excellent Film...hated by morons everywhere,10,31 October 2005,"A very-well crafted tale by genius film innovator, M. Night Shyamalan...breath-taking cinematography...amazing sound score that was robbed at the Oscars...a very impressive set built by human hands...pleasing performances by several talented stars including Bryce Howard, Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody & William Hurt (who kicks ultimate ass). THE VILLAGE is basically flawless on a technical level. Those who say the story sucked and the monsters weren't scary and the twist was terrible would probably rather enjoy watching that new mind-blowing Polson film HIDE AND SEEK or scream their heads off watching a girl roller-skate backwards in BOOGEYMAN. What a bunch of morons. Disliking THE VILLAGE is okay, since everybody has their own tastes, and although I know several people who love it all I hear is how ""horrible"" it was and how everyone was suspecting something greater. Well, if the ending was so disappointing then why didn't anyone guess the main twist, WHICH WASN'T REVEALED UNTIL BASICALLY THE VERY END. I guessed the twist for HIDE AND SEEK after watching one trailer. C'mon people, whatever happened to a little appreciation for effort. At least Shyamalan's trying to push the envelope a bit; THE VILLAGE had no CGI in it and dealt with deeply reflective themes of human nature. At the same time, it WAS scary, and WAS entertaining, contrary to what many people are saying. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out, but keep an open mind and please, relax.",The Village

The story is so stupid it just makes me want to punch myself in the face. In one part a severely retarded guy mysteriously breaks out of a building he is locked in, puts on a scary looking suit and is able to track a blind girl through the woods (how he even knew the girl was there i don't know). Then he tries to scare the girl for a while before falling into a large hole....and thats not the worst of the stupidity... Another thing about this film that bothered me is that it was advertised as a scary movie, I don't like scary movies too much, but i go to see them occasionally because they can be good for a laugh. This movie turned out to not be a scary movie, but an attempt at something profound that did not come even close to the mark.",The Village

However, the woods - and the village itself - contain dangerous secrets.",8,4 March 2017,"'The Village' is a well thought out, intense movie that raises some genuinely good questions. I enjoyed it and my only complaint would be that the story moved pretty slowly, but it was a good way to spend two hours. The acting, plot and soundtrack were all excellent. One thing I enjoy about M. Night's films is that there practically no explanation of what the movie is really about - you watch it and the story and all its mysteries unfold. 'The Village' is a perfect example of this. The film opens with a small community living their normal lives, except for that there's monsters in the woods. The plot centers on a girl that must go through the woods to the towns to get supplies. My favorite part of this movie is how it deals with disabilities and mental disorders. The main character is blind, and another character has a mental disorder. The theme of the movie was also thought-provoking. Is it right to run away from your own mistakes? I would recommend this movie if you want to watch a slightly chilling, original story that leaves you deep in thought.",The Village

The village takes place in modern day times, where people have no technology whatsoever, and definitely no WiFi. There are elders in this village, as most villages have, and they have led their people out from the towns like Moses. Only that they weren't Moses. And they definitely were doing it from their own view.Things happen in the towns. People are wicked, they have no heart, they kill, they burn, they kill again, and they die. The Village is different. People live like the pilgrims: plant your own crops, have no basis for medicine, and train their innocence. But what is innocence to humankind? Where there are humans, there isn't any innocence...or is there? I have to say, this movie wasn't the best of all movies, but it wasn't the worst. The plot is a little predictable from the beginning ,but as you move on, you'll be impressed by the humor and the suspense in the movie.

1103,solonjohnson,An amazing movie of Love and what love will make you do.,9,5 March 2017,"M. Night Shyamalan's Village starts out with a father sadly lying beside the coffin of his young boy. The village after the death of this young boy goes back to the routine of life with a simple yet peaceful way of life. You can tell that this village has many sorrows but is very peaceful. Events then unfold to show that this village has many queer things about it, such as red being a bad color as well as the citizens never leave the village. People of the village fear that once you go out of the village monsters of red will attack you in the movie these monsters are called ""those who we do not speak of"". So, the people of the village make sure to never leave the village for fear of ""those who we do not speak of."" Through the movie ""those who we do not speak of"" leave marks and warnings not to leave the village. Another tragedy occurs should the main character leave the village for help? Throughout the movie, M. Night Shyamalan uses unique ways to create suspense which hooks the watcher in. M. Night Shyamalan uses long shots as well as reflections. When you cannot see the thing of importance and you can only see the character's reaction you badly wish for the camera angle to change so that you can see what the characters see, in this way long shots are very well used. Another characteristic of suspense created from the cinematography was reflection of water, showing ""those who we do not speak of"" in pursuit of the main character, this effect creates much suspense and desire to change the angle to see the monster's physic. This effect keeps the audience questioning the appearance of these monsters. Another ingredient of suspense in The Village was the amazing music that enraptured you putting you in the shoes of the character. In conclusion, I find that The Village is an amazing enrapturing movie. M. Night Shyamalan skillfully uses reflections and long shots to create suspense, as well as using extremely suspenseful music to match the amazing cinematography. I would recommend this movie to a friend if you are into a suspenseful deep thinking sort of movie.",The Village
1104,danielyukia,Really?,1,5 March 2017,"Daniel Yu March 5, 2017 The VillageWith great expectations for my film class, our class started the semester by watching a film called The Village by M. Night Shyamalan. This film started out in suspense, just like how thrillers are supposed to start. The setting seemed like it is set somewhere around the 1700s. The movie starts out with people having worried facial expressions and a sort unpleasant atmosphere. To even further keep the audience on an awkward mood, there is also a failed proposal to one of the characters. With all this happening, we later found out that the village is under constant pressure from a creature that attacks the village. Because of this, people don't leave the village even in an emergency. However, when one of the characters needed medication from an injury, the main character goes in an adventure to through the wood to find the medicine. This film is not one of those ""action-packed"" film that modern people find these days. It is a slow-paced movie with a rich story line. There are many times when we must think for ourselves to understand what is happening. Therefore, this is a film for higher class thinkers.Personally, I did not appreciate this movie. There were way too many times when I thought nothing was happening and the story line was not moving forward. I also thought that the setting that was set during 1700s didn't interest me. However, the thing that bugged me the most was the major conflict and the solution of this film. I personally thought that the major conflict of this film is not very important and came out of nowhere. The conflict happened in the middle of the film and came unexpected. There were no follow up or any sort of clue that the conflict was going to happen until it happened. Lastly, there was not a conclusion to the conflict; the movie ended in an abrupt manner. Overall, I would recommend this film only to people that come to think. For viewers that want a straight forward story line, this would be one of the last film that I would recommend. This was a meaningful, but a not-so-interesting film.",The Village

But I was wrong, the story is really shallow, the acting is so bad, I cannot remember when was the last time I saw any movie like this.The movie is a fiction, like ""field of dreams"" and if I had this in my mind before watching the movie, I would have given it a 4 or maybe a 5, but as it is now, I can not give it more than 2 very generous stars that's only because I like to see William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver.The idea of the movie is interesting, an Amish like society isolated from the outside world where a group of elders decide about the important issues. An utopia of American dream, where girls and boys become adult and chose their partner and get married and life is as good as you can imagine in a perfect Christian way of living. But as the movie goes on, it looses its strength and becomes a boring un-realistic story.The part that disturbed me most was the scene were Edward Walker (William Hurt) refuses to shake hand with Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) because he has feeling for her. That reminded me of the meeting of Iraqi deputy prime minister with secretary of State, when he refuses to shake her hand, that was the level of fanatic stupidity promoted by this movie.I am very disappointed at Hurt and Weaver to take part of such a bad movie.

There is nothing memorable about any of the characters. In fact I saw this movie about a year ago, and all I can remember is that it is so crappy never to rent or buy it again. Even the clerk took it back after my purchase, agreeing that it sucked. This picture was advertised as horror to dupe fans of the genre into seeing it. What we got was a misleading horrible film that one can barely sit through. The only reason I didn't turn it off is because it was marketed so well that I thought it would get better. I was wrong. IMDb wants me to write a ten line submission , well let me tell you all I can say repeat is what garbage this film is.

1113,TheOthaItalian,Twist sinks this already struggling ship.,2,18 April 2006,"I thought this movie was nothing more than good for the most part, but the twist is just to bold and leaves audiences scratching their heads and wondering how ridiculous this is instead of connecting the plot and it's twist. The whole idea of a industrial society living isolated from a modern day society is just pushing it, the unrealism of it is to much for and average audience to comprehend. You cannot base a movie on monstrous beings and elaborate on them so much and have to audience totally submerged in the current plot and then just lift up the blinds and show them this completely different plot with a completely different mood. A twist should have an audience saying, ""Hmm, thats intelligent and surprising but still logical and reasonable."" This twist made me just say no, it;s to far over the top, just a over fabricated idea to the point of utter improbability and confusion.",The Village

Suspenseful music that at its climax comes to rest on views of gently bending trees or a peacefully rippling stream. The audience is tricked into believing it is a simpler time - period clothing, cumbersome speech, large outdoor Pilgrim-like feasts, and worst of all, a tombstone placing the date as 1897. The last was cheap - why when no one else in The Village except those prolific procreating Elders know what the actual date is anyway? Red hair, red lipstick - when red is verboten. The blind woman who sees in colors - don't ask me what color you are. The security guy lifting meds, the newspaper with all the murder and bad news, open, juxtaposed, M.

It has been pumped up and advertised as being really scary. But it's not as scary as Signs (but it does have it's moments). The advertising is a little misleading and makes it look like it is a horror movie, which it certainly isn't. Having said that, I highly recommend this film. Almost everything you see in the previews occurs within the first half hour or so of the movie. This actually leaves you really wondering and anxious about what will happen next. Bryce Howard shows a lot of promise and appears to be more than just another Hollywood brat. This is certainly her movie, and not Phoenix's, though he is quite enjoyable as well. The focus is on Howard. This is good, but it forces other great actors like Hurt and Weaver to be under used. After viewing the film, you will have to think about it a lot. Are the character's actions justified? What lengths would any of us go to to protect ourselves and those we love? What is the price of fear? Is the end result worth it?",The Village

From almost start to end I was on the edge of my seat, nerves stretched as taught as wire and at one point I literally jumped out of my seat - something no other movie has ever managed to do (and I wasn't alone in this). OK, some cynics might think that the whole premise of the village (the place not the movie), once it is revealed in the course of the film, is rather twee and rather far fetched, but it isn't really when you consider peoples like the Amish.

The film explores how one community isolates itself from the townships in order to preserve a simple lifestyle, maintain its innocence and avoid suffering. In practice, as the film evolves, it becomes apparent that suffering and pain cannot be avoided and difficulties arise as the deception on which the community is founded begins to be uncovered. The film has a number of poignant scenes where the performances of the two central characters adds great warmth to the film.I'd highly recommend this film.",The Village

Mr. Shyamalan has taken a twenty minute ""Twilight Zone"" episode and stretched it to 100 minutes! There is nothing NEW here, nothing surprising, nothing scary, nothing interesting and worst of all......nothing ENTERTAINING. You basically wait 70 minutes for the payoff you KNEW was coming 40 minutes ago. And the journey getting there is a snooze. One of the main characters doesn't talk much and another character is blind but is able to get around with not much trouble at all. As with EVERY movie, I say go see it and JUDGE for yourself though!!! M. Night is NOW batting .250 (1 out of 4) in my book. ""Unbreakable"" was another borefest, just a bad movie. ""The Sixth Sense"" was original but just OK. The unexpected HUGE box-office made it seem better than it really was. ""SIGNS"" is the only first rate, real movie from M. Night.

1123,athosusmc,Virtue without courage,10,22 October 2006,"Seldom do I wake up in the middle of the night and think about a movie. When I do, I buy that movie. I then ask myself why the film penetrated my imagination so completely and then set out to study every camera angle, every piece of dialogue, every character until I understand. Naturally, this is a time-intensive process but, thankfully, only a handful of movies have affected me like The Village has. I adore almost every aspect of this film; However, I wish to comment on one element that had great impact on me: M. Night made me want to live at Covington. The simplicity, the community, the peculiar but polite speech, the seeming virtue of the place caused a yearning within me. I wanted to be there. But after the second, third and subsequent viewings, I began to question my desire. Covington was a place of traditional values, where men were gentlemen and women were ladies, democracy mixed harmoniously with authority, a place aloof from crime and corruption and danger (somewhat). But in avoiding danger I believe the fictional town sealed its own demise: For all their apparent virtues, the citizens of Covington lacked courage. With the exception of Ivy and Lucius, the population had the moral stature of sheep. The children were taught to fear and to hide. The very foundation of the town was based on running away from problems instead of facing them. As C.S. Lewis once pointed out, ""...courage is not simply one of the virtues, but the form of every virtue at the testing point... A chastity or honesty, or mercy, which yields to danger will be chaste or honest or merciful only on conditions."" The tragedy of The Village, in my mind, is the degradation of that moral conviction called courage that, unfortunately, negates all the intended good that the founders of Covington sought to create.",The Village

Is the following true, or is it a figment of my on own imagination:--The ones Whom we do not speak of=ARabs, Muslims, Al quaeda -The leaders of The village=The New Cons, or a psychotically conservative government that uses fear to'protect' its people. -Noah=The average American psycho who went mad because of what he found out about his society-The Blind Lady=The Average American citizen who is motivated by love but just can't see the truth?I've been trying to spread this interpretation of mine among everyone I know and on the net.

I don't have his email though and i don't know how to contact him, so maybe other movie goers can help? Your feed back would be exceedingly appreciated. Thanks.P.S. For all those who left the movie theater once the monster showed up because it didn't look""real"" ..I'm afraid you didn't get it at all.

WELL DO NOT TAKE ANY NOTICE OF THE TRAILER, AS FAR AS I WAS CONCERNED, THE ONLY SCARY AND HORROR PARTS OF THE FILM WAS INDEED THE FILM ITSELF, I have never seen such a BORING, STUPID, LOAD OF RUBBISH, film from such a good director, All I can say is that he started off with a good idea then run out of them, the twist in the film, is the whole total let down,,,, of what you was lead to believe, and then you are left with an expression of sucking lemons,,,, and a bitter and foul taste in the mouth,,, I could have screamed with anger and put my foot straight through the television followed by the village DVD which went straight into the bin..... after the so-called twist.But obviously people seemed to enjoy it, hence the star ratings and reviews, but speaking as a great horror fan, sci-fi fan and movie lover, there is certainly no love for the village it should have been called the village going round in circles and getting lost.. as you know doubt will, when watching this film,,, But that is my point of view, i will let you be the judge of that,,,,, I only wish i could say happy viewing but i cannot,,,,, the end,,,,",The Village

Although, it was a very very clever plot and very good acting, especially from Ivy Walker (don't know the actors name) I thought the plot was brilliant, not normally something you'd see in a scary movie, though the film was not all it promised.

It would have been so much better if the monsters stayed real, and it was NOT set in modern times. For me the end ruined the movie because you couldn't watch it again the same way. Overall he had a great idea that went wrong all because he wanted people to talk about the ending. I hope in his upcoming movies he doesn't try this again.

The bad reviews of the movie is from what I believe to be from unimaginative people. Looking at the posters & publicity will make you expect a horror movie but it isn't. Well, that was what I expected though but because of an open mind and a love for twists, I was able to appreciate the movie as it is.

1132,fmlf377,Plot Twists are not the only genius of M. Night Shyamlan,7,21 June 2006,"I have never been a fan of M. Night Shyamanlan. His movies are earnest and well-made but have always been too slow-moving and far out for my tastes. But I thought The Village was his best movie to date. The mood is like a Gothic fairy tale, but the monsters - or ""those we don't speak of"" - seem to symbolize the monsters we can create out of traumatic circumstances, as well as the lengths we will go to try to protect loved ones from fear and suffering. Shyamlan addresses this dilemma with a sensitivity that, while certainly not new, is never naive.While some might say the talents of an all-star cast was unnecessary, I think it was such talent that drove home the theme of this film and kept it interesting. That heavyweights like William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Adrian Brody and Joaquin Phoenix managed to be so effective in such understated roles was very refreshing and says a lot about their talent.Also, those who have become used to shock fests and outright horror will be disappointed because, although there are some genuinely creepy moments and one scene that's truly shocking, the creepiness is only a backdrop to a much bigger issue.Although I figured out the trademark Shyamalan plot twist before it was revealed, the final decision of whether or not to keep the Village secret was still a satisfying idea to ponder.In spite of some extremely cheesy creatures and some comparatively weak moments near the end, Shyamalan put great care into this work and definitely earned my respect as a filmmaker.I recently watched The Village again and enjoyed it more the second time around.",The Village

I came to watch this movie loving all previous Shyamalan works and get not disappointed. The trailer said: ""Do not tell the secret of this movie to anyone!"" I can help falling on that, and it is exactly what happens. I usually try to find out the secret but it is not possible. And I have to confess that I used to know many fiction plots including this kind of psicologic-anthropological-fiction one. There are so remarkable philosophic and psicologic insights during the film that I can not quote one. It should be seen and think about them all after. It is amazing how Shyamalan movies are easy to talk about after seen. There are always key points that drive the plot to a interpretation that, as you do not know the end, should lead it to, but they simply ""pass me by"" unconscientiously. I was capture by the image (and specially the sound) of the creatures and simply could not think, just feel as the images pass by. At certain point I tell to my wife: ""The creatures is showing on! So, it can not be fake, spiritual, man-dressed or something like that. So what is it?"" She was to afraid to respond. And that is the point. You do not have to be afraid but you will. That is the key point why some people tell me that they hate this movie. The fell betrayed cause the are afraid during all the movie and then the end came to shake then to our world with a fantastically punch. Some friends tell me: ""The end revealed an impossible and fantastic issue that remains illogical and improbable."" Then I answer: ""That is why I love it.""

It opened there months before it did in Spain, so I ran to the theater (I'm very big fan of Shyamalan's work) In the end I was very disappointed. I was expecting to see a terrifying movie, after all those scary trailers and promotional stuff. What I saw, instead, was a tale, a modern tale with a dept and a meaning I failed to get in this first viewing. So, back in Spain, I went to the movies to give it a second chance, and then I understood everything. I knew what I was going to see, so I enjoyed it like very few films before. On the other hand, people left the theater disappointes, just like I was on my firt viewing. It is clear, Shyamalan shoul fire the guy who made promotion of this film. It has many things making the ticket (or DVD now) worthy. The beautiful score by Newton Howard, cinematography, production design... Everything matched perfectly the tone of the movie, its poetry and legend. And what about the actors. William Hurt deserved an academy award for his emotional character, and Bryce Dallas Howard lightened the screen with her only presence. I was a bit disappointed with Joaquin Phoenix's character, I expected for him more screen time and more importance in the story. And Adrien Brody enjoys his part and makes it believable. The story is great. That isolated village, the forest (you really feel scared when the characters are inside, though the creatures haven't been shown at all), the message about control through fear (Bush) and the beautiful ending make a great movie, for me, the best one that came from Shyamalan's genius.

What they have to say about this (and other movies of M. Night Shyamalan) is of a piece with the way Pauline Kael used to dismiss Hitchcock movies as fluffy, second-rate thrillers. Or the way logical-positivists dismiss all philosophy. Here's a clue: If you're an MSM movie critic and see and dislike one of this fine director's movies, spare yourself some professional embarrassment and recuse yourself. ""The Village"" isn't a complicated movie, but it does explore some quite interesting subject matter--what constitutes and sustains a community, what role does the individual play, how do the tensions between individual and community play out and, in that process, how deeply does this interplay challenge and touch our hearts.

It has fantastic performances by some of the all star cast list, not least of which William Hurt. This film highlights many flaws of the modern world and while being a bit 'black and white' it gets it's message across well.

I can only surmise that many viewers have missed the satirical aspects of the film and have over-looked how M. Night took blatant stabs at modern organized religion. The Village itself is a parody of any religion as it draws boundaries around people and teaches that if they ""step over the line"", there is harsh punishment, administered by an evil being. Many believe modern religion, namely Christianity, was drawn upon in order to keep the masses of an otherwise uncontrollable society in order. This idea is portrayed in this film as the village elders use the same type of tactic to keep the village children in order. Much as many religions try to shield their followers from influences that may disagree with their respective teachings, the village elders do exactly this as they prevent their children from experiencing any outside societal influences, lest they be swayed to no longer follow the belief system of the village. I encourage everyone to see this film, but see it for what it is, a religious satire, not a love story and not a horror film. Watch this movie with an open mind, regardless of your religious beliefs...you just might learn something.",The Village
1147,atgfarmboy,Less interesting than watching mold grow,2,11 September 2006,"I cant believed I wasted any of my life watching this film. It was awful. The director's love of 'clever twists' in his films make this as predictable as an episode of Scooby Doo. It must be said that The Village is awful in a special way. A film like Showgirls or Sidekicks is so bad that it's funny, but this was so bad it was just very depressing. Phoenix isn't a bad actor but this must rank as one of his worst films (yes, that includes Signs!). At the end of this film I was left feeling that nothing had happened. And come on, who doesn't find the thought of a blind girl navigating the forests alone utterly stupid? She would have starved and died in that hole not climbed out. Also, how could the monster being a disabled kid in fancy dress not be construed as anything less than hilarious? M Night Shyamalan films: They're not big and not clever.",The Village
1148,getawaymaxx,Good Lord!,1,23 September 2006,"I must admit that I kinda waited and wanted to see this film. The concept and settings sounded scary and I thought that there would be great potential. Luckily enough, I never saw this pile of crap in the cinemas and instead saw it on TV a long while later. I would have been utterly furious if I ever saw this trash in a real cinema as it would have wasted an entire evening.First of all, the really terribly titled ""Those we don't speak"" of - I really want to slap the genius who came up with that terrible voldemort-ripoff lame name, don't even exist. Its just a costume that the villagers wear to scare their own from escaping the village. Oops. Did I give away the MNS twist? No, there must be another right? The creatures must really exist and they show up in the end right? NO. The entire twist was what was already described. The movie thus ends halfway through and the rest of it is an absolute waste of time.This in no way, qualifies as a horror flick. Firstly, how can creatures that at best, remove the fur from small, dead animals, be considered such a huge threat? Even with one not realising that the creatures are a farce, their supposed crimes are almost always trivial and get over-reactions from the dumbass villagers. You'd think that all these bare faced flaws would be made up by the great twist at the end, but no such twist exists. The crap mentioned before doesn't qualify as the twist.If thats not enough, Shyamalan has the balls to throw the most annoying and irritating cast of characters ever seen in cinema history, at the audience. Joaquin Phoenix is great as always but the rest act plain weird and their acting skills are'nt good enough to make it look like realistic weirdness. Ivy should go down in cinema history as the most annoying, 1-dimensional character ever conceived. You'd think that she'd get eaten by the monsters but they don't exist, remember? There was only one memorable scene in this movie which has sadistic comic value. The two sequence of scenes where Joaquin Phoenix's character gets proposed to by Ivy's sister were hilarious. If there were more such scenes, actually utilizing the weirdness of the annoying characters, perhaps the movie may have even been watchable. All in all, this movie is a shallow character study of retards and should be avoided.",The Village

It made out that it was a good, scary movie - so we got it. However when my friends and i sat down to watch it and the only time we got scared was at the sudden movement of some furry animal. I was very disappointed with this movie - i just wish i'd known how bad it was so that i could have got a better one for my birthday :S.

Safe, and loved and protected.The isolation is overwhelming, the unease palpable, yet there is a quiet dignity, and purposefulness in everyone's behavior.The dialogue is kept to a minimum, allowing clever use of visual images to create the occasional shiver down the spine. Slow panning across a mist covered woods made me cover my eyes ! but I was so pleased that because of the skill in Direction, it allowed me to recover very quickly.Head turns and body movements are gentle, some of the violence is masterfully disguised and justified.I have seen the movie 3 times now, and will watch it again.",The Village

1154,megan-234,Worst movie I have ever seen,1,21 December 2006,"The trailer for this movie was so exciting. I love horror movies and this seemed perfect. I planned on going to the movie the day it came out but a series of unfortunate events led me to having to wait almost 2 years before finally a friend and I watched it around 3 AM. Even at this hour I realized it was terrible. I hated how the camera zoomed up on the most random things, for instance the chair at some point, taking away the very little real drama there actually was. The acting was horrible, the characters seemed to be too detached. The blind girl falling in love, killing a mentally disabled guy in a lizard suit, and saving her boyfriend was way too much for me. And when the mentally challenged guy was locked away but some how found the lizard suit was just pathetic. I thought that the story was a good idea, but the creator (can't spell the name) made it seemed jumbled, like it wasn't proofread or a child's story. He had 3 different stories started at once. The horror part, the love interest, and the weird ending could have been 3 separate movies in varieties characters. I don't think the writer spent enough time on fixing some of the goofs and went too much into the dramatically unnecessary area. I am a teenager and I'm pretty sure I could have done a better job than he did on this. The only part I liked was when she found out they made the town to be a safe heaven for those who did not like the way the world was becoming, but I think that part was very weak.",The Village

Night Shyamalan before he started promoting this movie, and after seeing The Village, I have no desire to see another movie by this guy! Now he's doing commercials on the SciFi channel as if he is some wunderkind.

1157,rachelmac-84689,I actually like this movie,5,1 November 2021,"While I totally understand most people's dislike for this movie, it is actually one that I enjoy. I've heard it said that great characters can make up for a flimsy plot, and I feel like The Village is a great example of that. Interesting characters played by great actors are what made this movie stick in my mind after I watched it. When you pair that with a great, creepy atmosphere, a memorable score, and beautiful cinematography you have a movie that I think gets more hate than it deserves.With that being said, yes the plot twist at the end is predictable and over-blown. Which plot twist you might ask? Yeah, I'm not really sure which one was more annoying. When you're watching a movie about supernatural creatures you kind of want the payoff to be, you know... supernatural. And when the creepy atmosphere wears off you realize that the other big twist is basically that they're an extreme Amish community.Again, I feel that the characters and acting really carry the story, and there are some genuinely scary moments that make the movie worthwhile. Much like M. Night's other movie Signs I got so caught up in the characters and emotion of the story that I was able to overlook its (sometimes glaring) problems. So this one will always be a favorite for me.",The Village
1158,Xibbers,Fabulous Movie (Spoilers Abound!),10,14 September 2004,"As a long-time fan of the director, I had planned on seeing this movie all along, but after a month of pre-premiere trailers, I was not very excited about it. Frankly, I'm not the kind of person who cares what was in the woods. I liked Sixth Sense, in fact that's where I first became a fan, but it was not because of the twist at the end. It wasn't even because of the creepy storyline. It was the writer/director/producer's ability to make a layered film with vibrant characters. I didn't like the kid because he could see dead people. I liked the kid because he made understand the frustration and isolation of someone in an intense situation. I was hit in the solar plexis by the excellent writing, and thrilled by the visual complexity of the film overall. The kid could have been a garbage collector for all I cared, but if Night was writing the garbage collector's story, I would be watching.As his next two films came out, I began to see a problem developing. People were wasting two hours of their lives, barely watching the depth of his stories, in wild anticipation of figuring out the last 5 minutes. Sort of ""The Forrest Gump Guide to Film Watching"". Friends with whom I would later discuss the films only wanted to explain whether or not they had guessed the ending, and often couldn't recall details, or even large plot situations, from the rest of the film. Night's mystique was surpassing his story-telling.So, this summer I went to the Village lacking my usual Night-fever, because the trailers led me to believe (as it apparently did millions of others) that it would be his most supernatural film yet. Wow. I was wrong. This film is one of the best films I think I have seen in years. I loved it. In my opinion, it is his best film yet. The trailers are very misleading, which is why I think many viewers and film critics were disappointed. They did not get the movie that they were led to believe they would see. Instead of monsters, they got mythology. Instead of horror, they got a love story. Instead of CGI, they got realism. Human nature, with all of our desires and dreams, terrors and disappointments. Choices that lead to happiness and sorrow. Finding out that we are the deadliest beast. Fantastic. You feel, in the end, that the Village is a real community, and Night does this...creates these layered human beings...with, at times, little more than 10-20 lines for the Villagers. But at the end of the film, I felt I knew every single person who lived there. I understood them. I loved them. I grieved for them, and celebrated with them. Come on, Night, you must have a map somewhere. Share with someone who understood what you were saying.Fan or not, see the film. Go with no expectations. Pay attention for the whole two hours, and not just the last 5 minutes. And understand you will be seeing something that is rarely out there anymore. Originality.",The Village

I was very into the movie all throughout until the end. The end, to me, was like ""Signs"" in which the aliens that were supposed to be threatening mankind and really scary turn out to be rather wimpy, killed by water (they invade a planet that is 70% water and hello, it is going to rain at some point)and can't even get out of the pantry. I had hoped for better from ""The Village"" but the big, scary monsters ""of whom we do not speak"", turn out to be created by the leaders of the community. If the monsters were just faked by the leaders, how did they accomplish the deep, booming sounds that shook the community when the monster(s) entered the village? If you watch that scene again, knowing that the monsters are not real, it doesn't make sense. I am hoping that in future projects, M. Night will be able to do better with his twist endings that have been expected of him after the brilliant ""Sixth Sense"".",The Village

The storyline was ruined by bad script writing, acting was truly awful, and I was just glad I got a promotional DVD of a different film for going to watch it.For me, a big offence was the acting of IVY, a blind girl. She sauntered around with her eyes open, and it wasn't until over half way through I realised that she was supposed to be blind. As several members of my family and close friends are blind, I thought this was a disgraceful portrayal of blind people, as it looked to me that she was faking it and any minute it was going to unfold that she could actually see the whole time and the blindness was just a ploy to con the other villagers, but no twist arose at all.By the time the credits came on and I got up to leave, I noticed the viewing theatre which was crowded when I entered was now down to 6 other people excluding my companions.If you're going to watch this film, take my advice and don't waste your time.",The Village

The acting was great, especially Adrien Brody and Bryce Dallas Howard who really pulled you into the story and make you feel for the characters. The creature was presented and integrated into the story. The writing was outstanding too, especially for Joaquin's character.M Night delivers another great film with a great twist ending.

Knight came along as a relative unknown with the Sixth Sense, however as he continues to make movies I think it becomes more and more difficult to treat the audience to the twist they are all eagerly awaiting. He has done a nice job with this film however. I was disappointed with Signs as I felt the end did'nt justify the rest of the film. The Village is a much more balanced film, with a gradual revealing of characters and plot that kept me involved enough to really enjoy the ending. Its difficult to say too much about the film and its characters without revealing anything important, so I will leave it with my recommendation, and especially recommended for M. Knight fans.",The Village
1164,MikoY,Flawed and disappointing,3,27 October 2004,"I enjoyed ""The Sixth Sense"". ""Unbreakable"" was not quite as good, and ""Signs"" continued the trend. What we've got now in ""The Village"", is a good movie only by the standards of someone who considers action films to be totally declasse.Don't get me wrong; I'm not claiming ""Terminator II"" is a cinematic masterpiece. But at least I was entertained while watching T2, which is more than I can say for ""The Village"".The plot limps, the central conceit is fatally flawed, the 'suspense' hardly merits the name, the acting is wooden, and the morals of those in authority in the eponymous village are deeply questionable--yet the director holds them up as admirable.This is not one of Shyamalan's better efforts. * of *****",The Village
1165,tedhealy,A Total Waste of Time and Talent,5,30 July 2004,"I'm a big fan of Shyamalan's prior films, but The Village simply doesn't work. And no, it's not that I'm too dense to understand that the movie is an allegory about how people are able to manipulate others through fear--I get that. See, the problem is not the concept, it's the execution.First of all, Shyamalan seems to have forgotten the simplest rule when it comes to creative writing: Show, Don't Tell. This rule is simply broken throughout the movie. Revelations that should have been shown are simply recited by the actors in the movie.In addition to that, his decision to give us an early glimpse of one of the creatures completely backfires. Why? Because what we see is laughable. Moreover, all three twists are revealed in such a way that they deflate whatever little tension remained. As a result, the movie is extremely boring.Is there anything worthy in this mess? Sure, the acting is solid all around, especially that of Howard, and the direction shows some of the brilliance that MNS has shown in the past.

Don't get me wrong, the 6th sense was awesome, but Shammy has yet to direct another movie since then without using the same basic formula of a twist ending. This makes his movies boring in that you're always aware it's coming, so there is no real surprise. Unbreakable was okay. Signs was just awful. But The Village might be the worst movie ever, ever! Furthermore, it looked as if he spent all of $50 making this movie. The picture quality was poor, and the ""monsters"" were just laughable.

Unlike many of my peers the twist in 6th Sense caught me totally off guard and turned it into one of my favourite movies which I've been happy to watch numerous times with each viewing adding a little to a deep character interaction ... not so with The Village! Shyamalan started so well with 6th Sense and Unbreakable but failed to hit the mark this time. That said I had little to say about ""Signs"" either.I give this 6/10 only because it was bearable but left me with an empty feeling.

Night's signature ""trick"" ending is also satisfactory, although the film seems to end rather abruptly. I would recommend this film to anyone.

I agree with most of these negative reviews because like so many, I feel I was duped into going to see a movie, billed as a thriller, with a sci-fi twist. I mean why would anyone think otherwise? M. Night has made 3 previous movies, all with sci-fi plots. Granted you never know whether or not the film will end up reinforcing the story it puts out in the trailer, but it's a pretty safe bet. Imagine that the Bourne Supremacy, or some other film that ends up being a pure action flick, has a trailer that presents a love affair as the central theme? Granted trailers are revised based on what movie they are running as previews for (give a film a more romantic edge if you wanna appeal to an audience before The Notebook or some other chick flick comes on). But they went too far here.The biggest disappointment for me was not that the plot was easy to decipher, because I don't think it's so black and white. Although I will say I guessed at the twist when before seeing the movie I asked someone, ""wouldn't it suck if it was this..."" Still while watching it, I didn't know whether or not it was right because I was fixated on finding out what these creatures were. I was shocked with how ostentatious they looked but I knew that if anyone could explain their existence it would be Shayamalan.But then he goes and makes the easiest escape possible - these creatures aren't real. I mean come on. It would have even been more interesting if he said they were a figment of the imagination. But to say that they are simply costumes donned by people is the worst way out. So here we have an audience crammed with thrill seeker, who don't just want to be scared but want to be fascinated by an explanation that defies the imagination. And instead they get an episode of Colonial House gone wrong.At it's heart that's really what the movie is. It seems to cater to the latest craze of reality TV (UPN's new Amish show and Colonial House, for example) and make it into a movie. People came to see this film for the supernatural parts of it, to be scared silly by something that was really scary, not too feel like fools for believing in something so ridiculous that it ends up being just that, ridiculous. He could have gone somewhere with this movie, made it interesting in some way. But instead it joins that list of films that had potential and then chickens out of following through with an imaginative and original plot (The Matrix Revolutions comes to mind here too).I can appreciate his work for his directing ability and for the acting of the cast, but I have to say that the total plot and even the screen writing is on the weak side. Besides for the unappetizing ending, I also found myself on the receiving end of terrible dialogue that made me believe, more than anything else, that these people were not from the 1800s. It was laughable at times to hear some of the things these characters said and they ways in which they said them. One would also think that if you're starting a colony in today's world where only the ""Village Elders"" know the truths behind it, you wouldn't need to make believe it was 1897 or talk in some archaic language because you're kids wouldn't know the difference anyway. But I guess that's just me looking for plot hole where I otherwise would not have looked had the movie been better. That's just my opinion. I'll still go see his next film because I have faith in him as an artist but after this one I feel used and manipulated. 5/10",The Village

I'm watching it on TV right now, so I'm reminded of how much I like it. Good acting; good suspense; unexpected ending. I really like M.Night Shyamalan's work. He understands suspense and silence in story telling. He reminds me a lot of Alfred Hitchcock. But he's often misunderstood in today's flashy, immediate gratification society. Shame.I think this movie is well worth the watch. Just good storytelling and good direction. The acting is fantastic - old school.

1175,Gideon777,Elegantly understated,8,31 July 2004,"I appreciate very much the depths to which Shyamalan goes in his writing and directing. He has the good sense to not simply make a genre movie, but to make a movie about something in particular, and wrap it up in a certain genre, almost as a tool through which the audience can better see the characters. We are often too wrapped up in our own way of life to see other people like us objectively. So, he uses a plot device to help us to 'see' better. And in yet another movie, it works.The guise in The Village is that it is a horror/thriller that pits the members of a small town up against the mythical and horrific creatures of the woods. Unfortunately, far too many scripts stop at this point. Shyamalan goes further, and this seems to be the point at which most people tune out, which is a shame, because it is here that the movie gains its better qualities.The film is really about love and facing our fears. And deep down, it is simply a love story. There are many elements that represent our fears, both metaphorically and realistically. There are the literals, with the monsters in the woods, but also the larger metaphorical focus of the the reclusive nature of the village in response to the corrupt and fallen outside world. And it is an interesting foray into our fears and how we deal with them.All of this is thrown into high contrast by the character Ivy having to face the fears she has been grown up to have to save Lucius. While she is told that the monsters are not real, she is nonetheless forced to deal with one of them. And it is handled in a very classic way. There are the woods, and the rain, and the dark (e.g. ""it was a dark and stormy night!"") and she was abandoned by the two other boys. She is alone in the woods, a common literal fear and metaphorical projection for us all. The great theme in the movie however is not that she faced her fears on principle alone, but for the love of another. This element takes an average horror movie and interesting commentary on fear and turns it into a genuinely touching love story. Perhaps I am naive in seeing this, or lack the cynicism of other movie goers, but I very much appreciated Shyamalan's style of telling a 'tale' and all it represents.",The Village
1176,jf_cormier,Depressing imperfect movie,1,30 July 2004,"Although the movie tries to give us a feeling of fear, similar to that of the Sixth Sense - it just tries too hard. Everyone is completely down in this movie and the pace is glacial. It's never really explained why these people keep living where they live. This is colonial American, there's about 1 000 000 other places they could go.I don't mind going to see a good scary movie, but this one did not cut it. It was a very nice looking film, but a bit empty in too many places to become a classic.Two ** out of *****I'd go see the Manchurian Candidate instead - at least the spookiness in that movie is all to real.",The Village

After watching it several more times, I was totally transfixed.The Village is compelling, inspiring, passionate and chilling. Like The Sixth Sense, it is a film that needs to be seen several times before you can fully understand and appreciate the pure genius behind the plot.If you're keen on seeing this film, please watch it with an open mind and for goodness sake, don't expect a bloody horror film, because it is a lot deeper, and better, than that.If you like a film that makes you think and leaves you thinking about all the aspects within it and how they work so perfectly, its for you.",The Village

This review will in fact contain some spoilers.if u think that the thriller was good, then don't go see the movie because the thriller was scarier that the whole movie put together. M.Shyamalan used his two last movies to make people go see this one, shame on you.i dislike horror movies because i don't like to be afraid so i was prepared after seeing the 6th sense and parts of sign to see a movie that could literally freeze the blood in your veins, but this movie did the inverse making me mad for the price i paid to see it. first of all, this movie is not a horror, neither a drama nor a thriller, it is a romance, with some action done by a blind girl in a forest!!!!! how credible can that be... did shyamalan ever watch TV, he could learn that even experienced hikers can get lost and die... this is so improbable that she is even able to find back her tracks while being chased by a monster, those you cannot speak of, and ultimately kill it!! i don't buy this oh wait a minute... actually i did!!! i want my money backeven if most of the movie was bad, the play of the actors was pretty good especially Brody and Bryce Dallas Howard, the dialogs were better than OKso i do not recommend this movie to anybody, if u like horror, don't spend the 15$ for this one, wait for the exorcist that i hope will be better.",The Village
1179,bakedmind,Very Under-appreciated Film,9,14 June 2008,"M. Night is one of the few Writer/Directors out there, that is always pushing for original material. His story lines always engage me, keep me on the edge of my seat, and then totally catch me off guard. This film is all that with a fantastic cast. I loved every minute of the film and believe that it was victim to bad advertising. Most people going in to Theatres thought it was going to be a non stop horror film. Instead we got a very entertaining Suspense/Thriller Drama. Love Night and hope he doesn't change for the people who don't get him. The casting was spot on, the visuals were totally compelling, and the story was crafted so originally.. that it screamed M. Night. Actors love to be in his films for a reason and it's not just a pay day. When was the last film that exploded in the Box Office? A shame, yet Actors and Actresses know a master story teller when they see one. Thank god for the faithful followers of his that do exist.",The Village

What then followed was the slowest and most painful 108 minutes of my life. The film was a disaster in every aspect. I was eagerly anticipating watching it, as it came highly regarded from every person I know that has seen it. However, when it suddenly finished and the credits rolled, I was left gob-smacked as to what I had missed. It never got going. There was no substance to it whatsoever. The one thing that kept me watching was the famous so-called 'twist' at the end. (Which, by the way, I am still trying to work out what it was!) As far as I'm concerned, there was no 'twist'. The film started, dragged on....and on, and then abruptly finished. Immediately after watching I phoned my sister,(one of the culprits that recommended this to me)and I asked her a simple question, ""What have I missed?"" She gave me a wishy-washy answer and said ""Do you not think it was a fantastic film? The way in which we were led to believe that the film was set a long time before it actually was? And how there wasn't actually anything in the forest??"",""No"" was the short reply I gave. That was the end of that conversation.I feel conned, tricked and lied to from my friends and family. Maybe them telling me that this was such a great film and talking me into watching it was just a practical joke. A sick practical joke at that. It will take me a while to get over what has happened today. I strongly urge all you fellow film lovers to not make the same mistake I have made, and do not watch this film...ever.",The Village
1181,xhide97,Worst Movie Ever Made!,1,25 February 2012,"Never have I been so angry after watching a movie. Well, actually, the first 20-30 minutes of the movie aren't so bad; there's cheesy dialog here and there, but the movie is quite suspenseful. But then the plot of the movie is revealed, with another hour left until the credits show up. Moreover, the last line in the movie is probably the cheesiest last liner in any movie I have ever seen. As Roger Ebert said in his review of the movie:""To call it an anticlimax would be an insult not only to climaxes but to prefixes. It's a crummy secret, about one step up the ladder of narrative originality from It Was All a Dream. It's so witless, in fact, that when we do discover the secret, we want to rewind the film so we don't know the secret anymore. And then keep on rewinding, and rewinding, until we're back at the beginning, and can get up from our seats and walk backward out of the theater and go down the up escalator and watch the money spring from the cash register into our pockets.""To put it short, stay away from this movie.

I am also in awe at the talent of the newcomer Bryce Dallas Howard (Ivy) and am looking forward to many other films starring her. It is obvious that she will be the new it-girl soon!

Signs was alright, but proved to be prophetic: Shyamalan is trying, not to write good stories, but to make cultural phenomenons of the caliber that The Sixth Sense achieved. But you can't keep up the plot twist trick endlessly--it gets old, and predictable.This movie was laughable. In fact, I had to keep my giggles muffled in the theatre for fear i would insult some of my neighbors who actually seemed to be into it. The dialogue was terribly flat, the plot impossible, and the twist--well, my girlfriend and I jokingly guessed the twist amongst ourselves in a sort of ""what if it turned out like this? wouldn't that be ridiculous"" and were appalled to find it actually moving in that direction.don't waste your time with this movie unless you want a lesson in poor writing and film-making and a glimpse into the yes-man world of Hollywood: Friends don't let friends make embarrassingly terrible movies.",The Village
1184,dvu0,Brilliant,10,3 August 2004,"""The Village"" is clear proof that M Night Shyamalan is one of the most talented filmmakers of our time. Unfortunately, many are under the impression that his only purpose in life is to shock moviegoers with his every film. This school of thought, sadly, tends to be the not-so-subtle undertone to all IMDb comments and forums. I have seen the movie twice in its opening weekend, and I must say, without hesitation, that this film is absolutely beautiful. What viewers must realize is this: plot twists are always essential to a good story, but that in no way means the film must have surprises that hit as hard as the ending of 'The Sixth Sense.'That being said, allow me to continue discussing a few of the film's strong points (of which there are many):Bryce Dallas Howard's performance is flawless. For being one of her first leading roles she has shown talent that makes even the most polished actresses appear as amateurs. Her ability to express emotion throughout the film is so believable it is haunting, and this gift is only amplified by Shyamalan's keen sense of writing and camera movement. Two of the most powerful scenes in the movie exemplify this: the first, when Joaquin Phoenix and Bryce Dallas Howard are speaking on her family's porch, and the second when Howard fears that something horrible has transpired and moves hastily toward Phoenix's house.Without delving too much into the details and disclosing too much of the story, focus on Howard's and Phoenix's exchange in the first scene. This begins with how she is able to 'see' with her feet (a subtlety that some people tend to miss) and ends with dialogue that is so beautiful, it almost removes the characters entirely from the film's disturbing premise.The next scene to which I am referring is a single shot that centers on Howard (as she struggles to maintain composure at the thought of something horrific), which stretches halfway across the entire village. Her movement through the fear, sadness and desperation is perfect. I only hope that other directors will be able to harness and utilize this talent half as well as Shyamalan has done here.This is why I would like people to disassociate themselves from their preconceived notions as fans of M Night Shyamalan films. The basic foundation for his films is not to trick or dupe the audience, but rather to tell a good story; and whether or not you can determine beforehand what the ending will be, it is the journey that the characters take that is so 'shocking.' That's what viewers of 'Unbreakable' and 'Signs' had to realize. The level of fear to which the audience is subject is not to make the film scary, but rather to add depth and dramatic tension to the decisions the characters make. There will be points in all of his films whereby you feel terror--but this is not necessarily for the purpose of shocking the audience; it is a method of storytelling where we feel the same emotions the characters would if we were in the same position.There is a fantastic subtext to each and every film that Shyamalan has made, but that subtext has only been made clearer with 'Signs' (faith), and 'The Village' (love). Do not go to his films to be shocked, startled and scared, but go to them with an open mind with the eagerness to see a well-made story; there is a much larger picture than that which appears on screen.",The Village
1185,ddtoth,I fear that M. Night Shyamalan is trying to hard to replace Alfred Hitchcock,1,4 August 2004,"Being a rather huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock, seeing all of his movies as such, I must say, I would have thought that I would be intrigued by M. Night Shyamalan, however I did not realize at the time he would try to replace Hitchcock instead of trying to reach further levels in the film-making industry. I must admit this is a vast disappointment. You see, first you must understand nobody can ever replace Hitchcock, so M. Night Shyamalan trying to be like Hitchcock (i.e. making nonchalant appearances in the movies, wondering where and when he will pop up) will simply never work. Rather one would hope in this day and age, that Shyamalan would try to go beyond what Hitchcock envisioned, what Hitchcock was able to bring to the screen. There are always twists, upon twists, upon twists in these movies, that is a given, however when I first saw The Sixth Sense, it was obvious Bruce Willis was not among the living, Signs, really the same, you rather already know what would happen and with this latest project, you would have expected far greater things from Shyamalan, and to which to say I was disappointed is rather a vast understatement. Do not misunderstand, I enjoy the twists, upon twists and so forth, the ending, that is something I did not want to admit I expected, but when it was played out before my eyes, I didn't want to think Shyamalan was about to be just as obvious as in all of his other movies. One word of advice, Shyamalan has a brilliant head upon his shoulders, do not try to flatter Hitchcock by using the same techniques, compliment Hitchcock by rather taking his vision and bringing it to levels far above and beyond what Hitchcock himself ever dreamed possible. You would not want to be labeled as someone who copies Hitchcock, you would want to be known as someone all of your own, which Shyamalan rightfully deserves.I truly wish Shyamalan all the best this world has to offer, I can only hope he takes some of it~",The Village

Somehow, even if you do guess the surprise ending (as many will) you will still find yourself questioning other possible ideas- surely the sign of a good movie well made? Acting is, as usual in Shyamalan's films, a treat, Joaquin Phoenix providing a sound performance, as well as the intriguing character of Bryce Dallas Howard. Parts of this movie made me really smile, the emotion coming from the two afore mentioned. Some kind of sweet, olde world love. It drew me in and made me want to know how it all unfolded. The script was great and along with the great actors, made it overall a very good 8 out of 10.

1188,Absent_Void,Underrated movie...,10,24 November 2009,M. Night Shyamalan sure did a good work with sixth sense. But with this movie he shows us an awesome movie with an awesome ending. This movie's trailer showed an emo horror kind of film. The village is anything like that. It isn't even an horror movie. A lot of people was deceived by it's trailer and hated the movie because: 'Oh... It wasn't frightening.' ... Well it isn't suppose to be. The movie plot is awesome and the actors do amazing and intence roles.This movie is supposed to be about innocence and metaphorical. Not just another monster movie to frighten little kids. M.

I couldn't identify with the characters, etc. It was just lame.It looked nice, and was performed well, but M. Night should give up the genre and go for something different. His shots are interesting, he has all the money he could want for an innovative script, and I sure hope he directs again, but with someone else's material.If you don't figure out the ending before the end, you might be mildly amused.

It's a parable & it's great.It's a microcosm of life where we create rules within ourselves to protect us from vulnerability. Yet our nature is such that we are forced to seek truth , may be unknowingly, like the blind girl. What we know in the village is non-knowledge. Science is true knowledge,in this case the medicine. Yet the giving, receiving and using of medicine is shrouded in non-knowledge,though it might help Lucius Hunt. It shows how a cult takes shape. Here it is harmless but dangerous potential exists in such communities. If one looks into one's own mind one can see that we have our own ""villages"" hidden deep in in our own psyche.",The Village

The story lacks the serious cohesion though to make it anything special: the fundamental narrative concept is good enough to be thought-provoking over a pint, but not enough to build a feature-length movie. It tries to shore itself up with the love story, but as the big narrative secrets come out they're not surprising enough, and left me unfulfilled.I also felt the handling of Noah's character was a little irresponsible.

I doubt that he will ever succeed as directly as in ""The Sixth Sense,"" but ""The Village"" has well-developed characters, and is less implausible than ""Signs,"" in my opinion his worst movie. Further, the first hour or so is intensely suspenseful, and Ron Howard's daughter (I think) Bryce Howard is very compelling in the lead role.This movie is another of Shyamalan's thrillers- better than some, but not his strongest.

Night's and while 'The Village' didn't measure up to his previous three genre pics, I think this is a worthy film.The biggest recommendation I can give for this film is to walk in and suspend your disbelief, become one of the villagers and enjoy the film! It sounds like too many people are trying to out-guess the plot or predict the twist -- just let it go, there's no need to intellectualize entertainment. The movie deals well with fears as a theme and where/how they become seeded in the collective mind. Also a nice little love story here to keep things sweet. The monsters are cool looking to boot!

1195,david-694-263669,Dissing the Twist Misses the Point,10,24 March 2010,"I think this film has been given a bad rap by people who judge it based on the quality of his trademark ""twist"" at the end. Was I able to anticipate it before it was revealed? Yes. But that's not the point. For my tastes, this film speaks to one of my favorite themes in movies like Dark City or The Matrix, namely that no matter what the appearance of the world you're seeing, that appearance is an illusion.The movie asks us to consider in its microcosm the bigger question about the validity and reality of the world we inhabit. There's a metaphysical movement that is gaining momentum in these times about how much of what passes for ""common sense"" and the nature of reality is not nearly as true as we suppose it to be. What we've been learning at the leading edges of sciences like quantum mechanics and epigenetics is that many of the dominant ideas about how our world works are merely illusions beneath which a more nuanced and surprising circumstance waits to be discovered.Our world is not what most of us have been taught it is. And films like The Village pose a simple but very important question, namely ""Is what we think the truth of things are really the truth at all?""",The Village

Let this be a lesson to all major film corporations: Just because you have a well-established writer/director, doesn't mean you can fully trust him.Okay, first of all, the advertising for this movie is horribly deceiving. ""The Village"" being advertised as a horror movie is like getting a student to take ""Advanced Calculus"" by telling them it's ""an exciting outer-space excursion to a land of rainbow-colored gnomes and chocolate-covered unicorns that's both fun and uneducational! No math involved!"" It's neither fair, nor honest. I had seen ads starting back in February that got me and a lot of my friends anticipating this film. ""Finally,"" we thought, ""a movie that will live up to 'The Sixth Sense'."" Boy were we wrong.Then, there's the plot. This movie might as well have been a 2-hour documentary of an Amish community. Now I know this concept may seem WAY too action-packed for you to handle, but don't worry, M. Night uses vast movie-making powers to dull it down with unoriginal camera work, and what's more or less a total lack of a musical score. I'm sure you can imagine the exciting events that would take place in this setting: ""Will Jebediah's cow give enough milk for his 17 sisters to make it though another week? Can Ezekial find love with his cousin, Mary, or will his father, Jacob, get to her first? Will this year's harvest live up to expectations? Tune in next fortnight to find out!!!"" Then, of course, there's the obligatory 'holy crap I didn't see that coming now the whole storyline got turned upside down what's gonna happen not that I care' plot-twist that causes someone to take action and leave the village. Who could this be, you ask? Why the blind girl of course! Who better to send through a supposedly monster-ridden forest than a sight-less chick armed with a giant stick. Incredible writing here, folks! So now, after being bored for a good hour-and-a-half, we get to watch little Helen Keller run aimlessly through the woods with a hiking stick until she finally runs into a large brick wall. If you haven't left the theatre/turned off your TV/turned off your computer and deleted the illegally-downloaded piece of crap, you'd see the story deteriorate even further, as any respect you once had for Sham-aylan is lost, along with all sense and logic in the film.In summary, this movie should contain a warning label on it reading ""WARNING: This movie may induce boredom, drowsiness, and severe loss of intelligence.

1198,pluckmeguitar82,This is a terrible film,1,6 December 2010,"Where to begin with this film, oh god. Well it seems that we are seeing life in 19th century America, but then it is made perfectly clear that the people living in this 'olde' fashioned town, are perfectly aware that it isn't the 19th century, it is indeed the 21st century. So we have retards, all living together, nice. Not only this, they all choose to wear clothes from the 19th century. What is wrong with these people? If they had chosen to set up a commune type arena where they could escape the troubles and speed of the modern world, fair enough, so be it. But why would they choose to wear the 19th century clothes and talk like they just arrived from 'ye olde ship crossing the passage from foggy olde London town'? Is it so they can warp their children's minds in being retarded as much as theirs? The music for the film supports this idea with 'sea-shanty' type music throughout, confirming that we are most likely experiencing colonial America.Now let's move onto the monsters that haunt the surrounding woods that they 'dare not speak of' but talk about them all the time. It is revealed very early on in the film, that there are no monsters, it's idiots running about in done-up suits, keeping anyone from leaving the village. So let me get this straight, in order to protect themselves form the modern world, and the horrible things that happened to them in the real world, they decide to move away to an unknown location (not in today's world), and create a 19th century village where they all dress up and talk like they had just landed in America from Britain. Furthermore, they decide to keep anyone from leaving this new village, by pretending to be monsters running about in the woods that the viewers know aren't real from early on in the film.Watch this film if you want confirmation that there are more stupid people out there than you realised who will like this film and spent money on it to see it.

The story had no main plot and things just kind of happened without ever any meaning. Night sure casted a lot of great actors, but he didn't give them much to work with. And poor Joaquin Phoenix Got SUCH a small role! I wouldn't be surprised if the National Park ranger guy at the end of the movie had more lines!

The other people around me left the movie disappointed by the ""surprise"" ending. Shymalan is going to be cursed forever by The Sixth Sense so now everyone is going to want him to top that ending, which he'll never do.The Village had one of the more impressive casts that I've seen in a long time.

The largest trend in many reviews is that Night's directing excels over his writing. I agree; Night's got a great way of telling a story, but this one isn't his best. That doesn't make it a bad story. It's intriguing enough, and while the ending might be a little predictable (I saw it coming about 2/3 of a way through) the way it's presented make it worth watching. The cinematography, the performances, and Night's direction give it the edge over the story.8/10",The Village
1204,hobbitgirl11,Not M. Night's best but worth a look-,9,30 July 2004,"***Spoilers***So, this is not M. Night's best. But it is not his worst. I thought 'The Village' was a well acted and directed movie. Excluding the story.I expected for a film exceeding 'The Sixth Sense' which I did not find here. But, I did find some great acting. Bryce Dallas Howard was fabulous. Her raw talent just glows and she plays her character amazingly. Joaquin Phoenix was great though his speech can bug me at some points. He speaks quietly and scratchily. Yes, I know that this was required for the character but I have also noticed this in other movies. I found Adrien Brody playing his role frighteningly well.I found two plot twists in the story- a little one and a very obvious large one. The little twist was when Brody's character stabbed Lucius, Phoenix's role. The love story was my favorite part of the plot. Both Phoenix and Howard gave it so convincingly. The big ""twist"" was very lame. Lame not because it was a dumb idea but lame because it was obvious. I could see it from the beginning but I still thought it was interesting.I even liked the ending. My fellow theater-goers seemed disappointed but I didn't see where else they go with the story.One thing I found peculiar was the absence of the ""Rules"". I had read them everywhere- Let the bad color not be seen, etc. I thought it awfully strange that they weren't in the movie.The fright level was pretty much gone for me. I didn't think it was scary what-so-ever. If anything, it was somewhat intense.I didn't think it was an bad movie at all. Sure, the main plot wasn't too wonderful but if you like good directing, great acting and a sweet love story, I would recommend it.",The Village

This movie is boring, predictable, and at 107 minutes, overly long.Perhaps the director should concentrate less on trying to achieve some kind of mystical aura in making all his movies 107 minutes long and focus on what's contained in those 107 minutes.With the ""Sixth Sense"", I used to think this was a brilliant director, but with three more movies under his belt, I have relegated him to no more than a third rate hack, and am beginning to wonder who was really responsible for the final cut of that landmark, and thought provoking first film.The infamous Shyamalan plot twist ends up to be nothing more than vintage ""Twilight Zone"", and one we have seen many, many times before (and seen it done much better).In my assessment of this film, I may be wrong, the professional critics may be wrong, but the audience of around 600 movie goers I saw the film with was probably not. They laughed almost non-stop during the entire film. Not a good sign for a film billed with drama in it's description.Perhaps the studio can salvage the film by re-billing it as the ""Exciting New Comedy from M. Night Shyamalan"".",The Village
1206,Lizanne227,Think about it...,8,24 January 2012,"For both a video-editing class Im taking and English Literature I had to choose a movie. For English I had to watch a film and write a critique and also use the themes/morals/motifs/symbols to make a connection to a specific novel. For video editing I had to recreate my own trailer for any film. I chose The Village for both, and Im glad I did!The Village, contrary to other reviews, is perfectly logical. This is NOT a movie you can watch and assume the obvious. No, use the literary analysis skills learned in school to decipher the codes (and there are plenty). Consider the themes of isolationism, and how 9/11 effected us as a society (did we become more accepting of each other, or fear 'those we can not speak of'). The Village is an allegorical masterpiece! As I read some reviews of others claiming it was illogical, I was really disappointed that people could not take it for what it was;That is, a fictional thriller chuck-full of symbolism. Examples: 1.The color (anger, passion,and danger), 2. The color yellow (happiness,security), 3.Towns/villages (that sense of security we feel within them), 4.Lock&Key(again,more security) I could continue, but I wont.Despite the literary symbolism, there are even more clues to the overall meaning based on historical information and back-round information on when it was filmed. 1.The Cuban Missle Crisis- Cuba could of benefited by bribing that pilot to not fly over them, and so could the US considering the outcome. Thuse, the reasoning behind planes not flying over the village is FINE. 2. Pennsylvania- Yah, home of the Quakers way back when and very large Amish community today. 3. Blindness, okay, throughout time blind characters have been ""seers"". This may be some sort of irony, but seriously a blind character being able to see beyond the physical is nothing new-nor is it to be confused with fantasy. This is because in all themes of movies and books this has existed.I will admit a blind girl running through the forest is crazy, but seriously right before she left her father gave us clues that perhaps she was not born blind. The dialogue is clear of contractions so use that.The Village IS a good movie that was probably made longer than it should of been. This is a movie good for sociology, English, and basically anything. It does require you to dive deeper than what is directly observed/assumed. Do NOT let that influence you're perception of it, nor do you have to agree with the message of the movie. But thats just it- There's A MESSAGE. Nothing can be assumed. And if it doesn't all make perfect logical sense you have to look at it from a characters point of view. ACTING:Good SETTING:Superb SCRIPT: Perfect PLOT: Requires analysis",The Village

After 25 minutes, we started playing it in double and quadruple speed, and stopped when we thought that something interesting was going on. Hence, we saw the movie in approx. 45 minutes and still said to each other: what a piece of CRAP! (or as I would say in Dutch: wat een bagger). I understand that people like the movie, but for me it was slow (okay, I am going in the forest, okay, I am going, I think I am going, okay, I go...oh I get hurt...okay, I am his girlfriend, I am going, I am really going....okay, I am going...etc.etc.), stupid (let's put on our hedgehog suit and scare the villagers, let's look mysteriously at a mysterious box etc.etc.).

The ponderous, truly plodding pace leaves the actors (and actresses) in this film working desperately to save it. The views from camera angles aspect were well shot, but the direction was sorely lacking. The young lady who played the lead female role was very emotional, and acted with conviction, but was VERY unconvincing concerning being blind. Nice plot, but so predictable. A big-name cast was not given the free rein to develop their respective characters, in my opinion. Siguerny Weaver was playing her role with all the force in her very talented ability, but had, quite simply, too little to work with. William Hurt was convincing, if so low-key that it left a flat response. Once again, direction/lack thereof? Just my view lanman1us",The Village

1212,Krabat_v2,A masterpiece and Shyamalan's best so far,8,14 September 2004,"This movie is for you if you, like me, loved Signs. These two movies are very much alike, especially if you compare them to The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. Of Shyamalan's movies I saw Signs first and I was impressed with how he makes you think he's telling you a story about Aliens and corn circles and it's really about something else. (Trying not to give anything away here) The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable seemed kind of simple after that. Yeah, they were nice to watch, they had their twist endings but they just didn't have that emotional side I like so much about Signs.But now let's get to The Village. From the trailers I didn't really expect to see a movie like Signs, I was more expecting a Sleepy Hollow kind of experience. Boy was I wrong. Sure, it's creepy and it works much better at keeping suspense up than some people want to make you believe. But there's much more to this movie.First of all I've got to say that when watching The Village it was the first time since I don't know when that I felt I was watching a piece of art, not just a flick that wants to entertain. The images Shyamalan shows us are just beautiful. The colors, the composition are right away amazing. At some points in the film I actually felt like I was watching a painting come alive. What also adds to the art is the music. If you are at all interested in classical music or movie scores you will not be able to get this solo violin out of your head. When I first heard it I knew I had to get my hands on that score.OK, so the movie is presented in a nice way. But is it any good? Yes it is. It is IF (and I can't stress this if enough) you liked Signs, you don't want to see exactly what the trailer seems to promise and you don't mind slow films. 'Cause slow it is. Not in a bad way though. Shyamalan just takes his time to build up his characters and to create an authentic almost tangible atmosphere. In that he's supported by a great cast, especially Phoenix and Howard. Phoenix is good as usual but Howard just blew my mind. They start you off into a story that begins as a horror movie but then evolves into something far deeper and far more emotional. And if you let that happen to you, if you don't just sit there and wait to be scared you will really love this movie.I give it a 10 out of 10 because Shyamalan totally achieves what he tried to do in this film. You just shouldn't think it's about scares and twists.",The Village
1213,johnhuf,thought provoking,8,11 February 2005,"There are many who praise and many who abhor this movie. My take is well above neutral considering some logical flaws. Like other MNS directed movies, he weaves in suspense, visual experience and most notably intellectual conjecture. I would agree that he appears very Hitchcock influenced. I don't typically look at the DVD extras so this may be a confessed trait, but the techniques of cinematography, suspense and of course the perfunctory cameo smell vividly of sir Alfred. I would wager that MNS is in development and the shortcomings can be accepted as he moves toward the Hitchcock level. Imagine the early years of Hitchcock when you can see the creative brilliance but are bothered by the technical flaws. Know that he learned over his career and it is likely that MNS will as well. If we micro-analyze these developing films and lose the realization that we may be witnessing a new master filmmaker, we are losing the big picture. Films that excel will test our minds and emotions and will inundate us with a masterful blend of excitement, suspense, thought, visual intensity and emotion. I think MNS is well on his way to accomplishing this. With so many over-hyped, over budgeted crappy films to name, it's refreshing to find one that hits hard on all meaningful fronts and for the most part, succeeds. TO all who hate this film, consider that you are taking a narrow view and that a tastier palette of future offerings is very likely. I give this film an 8.0 and would go higher if a bit more tuning up had been done. THe story is very intriguing, the acting very good, the imagery is excellent. There are flaws in continuity, logic and credibility but they can be accepted in the larger view of the message of the piece.",The Village

I thought the cinematography was beautiful, and the characters were moving in their simplicity. How many of us have not gotten tired of what we see on the news and outside our windows every single day, and wish we could gather up all the people we care about and start over far away from it all? I know I have. The concept of the movie was so out of the box that it's brilliant if just given a chance. I love M. Night because he takes the audience beyond the typical Hollywood entertainment factor and makes them think and feel on a different level. Definitely my favorite M. Night movie so far.",The Village
1215,dstalker34,Beyond disappointing,1,2 February 2005,"I usually do not comment on a movie I don't like but this one was beyond anything I could imagine. I do think that M Night's style is interesting but outside of that, this movie failed on all accounts. I think that Howards performance was retched. I keep hearing people praise her performance as a great performance and one of the only redeeming points of the movie, but I cannot disagree more. She looks people in the eye when she speaks with them and it took me a while to realize that she was blind. I cannot respect a character who will put up with a totalitarian style government such as the one in this town. They try to pawn off Phoenix's character as a person with will unlike anyone else in the town. If he had such a will, he would have taken matters into his own hands and left the village without the blessing of the elders.I don't even want to start with the ending because it is completely incomprehensible for something like this to happen. I read the ending when it was leaked on the net about a year ago. I was under the impression that they went back and re shot the ending so I was looking for something different. It was a horrid ending when I read it then and it was a horrid ending when I viewed it now. To tie all this off, I hated this movie. M. Night, stop trying to trip us up with a surprise ending and just make a solid movie. I liked The Sixth Sense and I loved Unbreakable, but Signs and The Village just irritated me. Just make a good movie and stop trying to be quirky. I know that you can make a good movie.",The Village
1216,kevcowiffle,A good director writes a bad movie,3,24 January 2005,"M. Night has made some of the most memorable movies of the past few years, and whether he likes it or not, he is known for his trademark twist. Starting off, ""The Village"" has a lot of potential. It is eerily set in the back woods of Pennsylvania, and the setting alone feeds on the memories we all have of being scared of the woods at night. But this setting cannot carry the movie by itself, and we are left with a sub-par movie on a number of levels.His first flaw is in the characters. While they are likable, we do not see them enough to get a feel for them. When Luscious is stabbed, we do not know him well enough to feel very bad for him. Ivy, though the foremost character, is never really developed, and we don't get to know her as well as one should know their main character. The dialog is perhaps the worst part of the movie. It is extremely dry, dull, and often drags on for too long. Their old style of speaking often comes off as forced and unrealistic. The plot even seems sluggish, and after an hour of movie you realize only a few events have taken place.But the worst part of this film is the highly anticipated ending. We have come to expect something wonderful from M. Night's endings. Audiences go to his movies expecting to leave satisfied, and the 'twist' of The Village is extremely disappointing. It almost seems like a cop-out. Even if I had enjoyed different parts of the film, the ending left such a bad taste in my mouth that I wanted and hour and a half of my life back. Hopefully his next effort with be little more worthy than this one.",The Village

From the trailer on television it looks pretty interesting, but to sit in the theater and actually watch it was torturous! The actors were great. Bryce Dallas Howard was amazing. I hope she gets some better offers for a much better movie next time. During the movie, I kept noticing the microphone made more appearances than the actual characters---it was very distracting! The graphics and plot were awful. The only thing spooky about it was the noise--as well as background noises. I believe I saw a little bit of the set in the ceiling in one scene.

1220,stevecake_malfoy,Kind of a letdown...,7,30 July 2004,"I just came back from seeing this movie and I'm disappointed. But there were some good things about it: Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, and Adrien Brody all did excellent jobs, the sound effects were creepy (as they usually are in M. Night Shyamalan movies), and the plot was interesting.However, not everything about this movie was all wine and roses. Slight SPOILER ahead: you see the creatures way too early. There was no build up, and I thought they looked Halloween costume-ish.Another thing I didn't like was the very last scene. The movie ended and I was sitting there like, ""That's it?"" It felt very...unresolved.And lastly, I was not scared. At all. In fact, during one particular scene, I was laughing at a creature when I'm almost positive I was supposed to be trembling in my boots.On a more positive note, there were some great moments in this movie, including (slight SPOILER) Howard laying the smackdown on Brody.Overall, it was okay. I was generous and gave it a 7/10, mainly because of the superb acting and the aforementioned great moments. If you're a Phoenix or Brody fan, this movie would be good for you because both men deliver. Howard, this being her movie debut, also impressed me.

1221,BlueHarvest1983,"One of, if not the, best film of the year.",8,13 January 2005,"After watching ""The Village"" with a few friends not only did I enjoy it more than the first time, I saw the reason why many did not like it. Throughout the movie, one of my friends, who isn't as familiar with film as the rest of us, constantly asked questions about where the plot was moving. He's used to the films that spell everything out, and practically tell you what's going to happen before it does. I'm not saying this to slight him one bit, because he is in good company. America's viewing interests have been reduced to seeing the entire film before it happens. For example, in a cop drama, the plot may be laid down, drawn out in front of you, before anything actually happens. In a romance, you meet two characters and they fall in love. In comedies... well in comedies, actors say ""balls"" a lot. Gone are the days where you watched every move, listened to every line of dialogue, and kept track of each character in your head, and in the end, everything was resolved in your mind, rather than on camera.Many people went to this movie, because it was going to live up to the ""Sixth Sense"", and though contrary to popular belief, it surpassed what ""Sixth Sense"" did. It was a multi-layered trip through the human psyche-that asked you the questions. Some of my most trusted closest friends went into this movie, ""knowing"" they wouldn't like it, and then criticized Shyalaman because the know I love the film. From comments like ""He shot too many trees."" to ""I didn't relate to the characters."", I've heard it all. But when you sit down, look at the way Shyalaman uses shots, angles, sound, music, and positioning, and amazing performances you'll have to agree, he's a pretty darn good director.In using a blind girl, Shyalaman opened up a door that would seal the fate of his movie in the minds of many true film and literature fans. He could create one of the greatest characters on screen. One who could not see, happened to have the greatest ""vision"" of the whole village, and was able to conquer her fears, and also give something extra to the ""towns"". Joaquin Pheonix is brilliant, and says so much by saying so little, and Adrien Brody is downright frightening.Those of you who were ""dissapointed"" in the twist ending, or ""saw it coming"" congratulations, you're you've completely missed the entire point of this film. It's not supposed to be a surprise, or a shocker, but the real shock are the events surrounding it. Those of you who didn't think the creatures were ""scary"", maybe use your minds a little bit, and you'll figure out just how horrifying they really were. Those of you who ""didn't like the trees"", I think Harold and Kumar is more your speed.This film is probably the best of 2004, and one of the best of it's genre ever made, though no ""big shot"" movie critic will say this. It's sad what's happened to us as a people, and I truly believe, if many of the amazing movies of the past were released tomorrow, they'd completely ""flop"" like this beautiful film.",The Village

In my eyes Shyamalan is yet to put a foot wrong, making him one of the most important filmmakers in cinema today. No other filmmaker would even dare to put in a twist that extreme, but to me it works. Shyamalans stories have always been very human and The Village is no exception. it's not a monster movie (this i believe is why many were disappointed)it's a story about a select few people in a small village. it is very chilling, even the thought of the conclusion is very chilling.I will admit the film didn't strike me instantly as being brilliant, but Shyamalans cleverness makes the film play on your mind (Like all his films).

However, if you spend the whole movie trying to dissect the plot twists and be the first of your friends to guess the plot twist, you'll completely miss out. The twist is there, but for the first time in an M. Night Shyamalan movie, it's not the point. The payoff is the affecting relationships and mounting tensions that fill the whole movie, not just some relevatory end. The twist will, however, make you reflect on the moral choices the characters have made previously, and keep you thinking about them for long after you've left the theater. I've never been more frightened by a movie. Allow yourself to enjoy this movie, don't waste your time trying to be smarter than it.",The Village
1224,ReardonSteel,There was a better story here.,6,8 August 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan earned his way into the consciousness of the American moviegoer by stylizing the twist ending on the big screen. His movies play out like an extended version of Rod Sterling's Twilight Zone. This comparison goes beyond the surprise endings. Both contain themes exploring the complexity of human nature in the midst of tense and often mysterious situations. This review will contain no spoilers, but I will talk about the ending in general terms. People who watch this movie for the twist ending will be disappointed. First of all, it is quite predictable. Also, it plays out very gradually, rather than just hitting you in one, climactic moment. It's just not very logically or emotionally satisfying either. This does not make it a bad movie, however since Shyamalan's reputation is largely built on his endings, this will probably end up hurting the movie at box office. I'm still going to recommend the movie, however. But, this recommendation will come with the warning that you will likely leave the movie theater saying to yourself or your companions that, ""There was a better story here."" The acting is fine. The supporting cast is great, but the movie is basically all supporting cast. Joaquin Pheonix and Bryce Dallas Howard share a staring role, but there is no Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson character in The Village. But, the characters are interesting. The pieces you get of their stories makes you yearn for more. But Shyalaman is too wrapped up in his reputation to stop to satisfy this yearning. His tricks are becoming tiresome. When you go to the theater, take note of the moments where the audience (if there is one) reacts the most. Observe if they are reacting to the moment on the screen or the juiced up volume of a sound effect after a period of extended silence. M. Night Shyamalan is certainly a capable director. He is an artful creator of atmosphere. He also has a skill for pacing and I happen to enjoy the casts he selects for his characters. It's time for him to prove that he can bring a bit more to the table than a few cheap scares and a shock ending. You won't hate this movie, but you will be disappointed. 2/5",The Village

All I can say is I've seen quite a few negative reviews, both from critics and from people on the message boards, and I don't think this movie is near deserving of them. Sure, I agree that the movie was marketed incorrectly, however, that doesn't mean that it was a bad film. Acting was excellent by Bryce Howard, Joaquin Phoenix (as usual) and the rest of the cast. Shyamalan has a great vision of cinematography and atmosphere and James Newton Howard's score tells the story by itself and in my opinion is one of his best yet.If you go into the movie, forget about what the critics say, sit back in your seat and let yourself into the story, you'll probably find that it's a heartbreaking love story with enough frightening situations to keep you on your toes. Too many people went into this movie desperately trying to figure out the much talked about ""twist"" instead of letting it flow naturally. If this had been Shyamalan's first film, I bet it would have merited the same praise as The Sixth Sense. This movie was not supposed to be the biggest thriller of all time; if that's what you were looking for, you may be disappointed. Furthermore, if all you're worried about after seeing the movie is what Lucius' 'color' is, I believe you're truly missing the point.

1226,Powerbreak,Boring and pointless.,3,29 August 2004,"This movie was terrible! And yes it had nice photography. With a budget of $65M you can afford good technicians and a great DOP, but that doesn't help you out of your story. The only discovery at the end is that Shyamalan is just another Hollywood director trying to seduce an audience. And even if he was good with actors in other films, in this one they are stiff and boring. There is no character development and for the most part 'I saw dead people'. The movie was based on a child book ""Running Out of Time"". Unfortunately, they've adapted the story for a public of 6-year-olds. If you want to be frustrated and disappointed, go waste your money on this poor excuse for a movie.",The Village

This is not the case it's more like a drama with some scary parts in it. The story is annoying if you watch the whole movie.There are also some big mistakes in it:Ivy has a stick because she is blind she throws it away somewhere in the movie and picks it up(how does she know where it was ??)The monster is human but makes a sounds that (most) humans can't makeThis is just my opinion and I hope that some of you like the movie.But I didn'tInsomnia",The Village
1228,inimical,How to write a terrible story and then make it a bad film.,1,5 August 2004,"Some people have called this guy the next Hitchcock. All I can say is that they must be referring to his cameos. Because this is a film for slow people who can't figure out anything for themselves and need to be taken by the hand with flashbacks and story revelations. I think he spent more time trying to fit in little jokes and light moments than finding ways to scare or shock people. There are more ways to scare people than the ever popular hiding behind a tree and then turning to see what you are hiding from is right there. AHHHH! oh wait that was in the trailer too. I mean a little mystery would be nice, don't give away the ending before we've even got there. Time to go back to school Mr. S. My A/V tech made a how-to load super-8 film video with more of a twist.",The Village
1229,capalmr,More than just a Movie,10,30 July 2004,"I had the pleasure of watching The Village prior to its release today. The cast, photography, scenery, story, etc., etc., were much more than I had expected. This is not a ""spooky"" story maybe just a little), but a film that makes you come out of the theater and think about our world today and the world of 100 years ago. A beautiful love story (without sex) is certainly a ""breath of fresh air"" for today's film goers. For those of you who don't agree, you belong in a world of sex, hatred and killing! For those of you who agree, you obviously recognize the talent, beauty and effort it took to bring to all of us this wonderful story.

1230,vader1284,Not an action movie,9,31 July 2004,"There are going to be people who strongly like The Village, and people who strongly dislike it. Any true fan of M. Night will probably appreciate it for it's wonderful direction and cinematography. Every shot is meaningful throughout the entire movie. One is easily placed inside the small village in the woods and easily convinced that the settings are real. The Score is also very good. It adds to the suspense and overall power of the movie.It is not a teen horror flick. It is not gory, and not jump-out scary (at least, not really). I feel that the casual moviegoer who wants to eat popcorn and watch people get their heads chopped off will not enjoy this movie, they will likely find it boring. It is to be enjoyed as an experience, not as a way to kill 2 hours on a Saturday afternoon. People looking for an action movie will be better suited elsewhere.The movie has the feel of a Twilight Zone or an Outer Limits. M. Night's writing style is distinctive once again. The beauty of his characters is that they are normal people. M. Night's characters are never super smart, or verbose. They are easy to identify with.Ron Howard's daughter makes a strong debut. Joaquin Phoenix is good, as always. Brody steals the show, as an Oscar winner should. His talent is truly breathtaking and it adds light years to the movie.Worth seeing for the true M. Night fan or anyone who appreciates direction, cinematography, score, or strong acting. Not worth the money if you need to see stuff blow up and want to be so scared that you're kept awake at night.",The Village
1231,Smooth80,Underrated,9,26 January 2006,"When I first saw this film I already knew what the 'twist' was thanks to a friend of mine telling me all about it. However,I still enjoyed the film. The story is good but not amazing. What made this film great for me was the whole visual experience, this is what I watch films for. The cinematography was beautiful, every shot incredibly rich and textured. Admittedly, Shyamalan's direction draws on Spielberg and Hitchcock but he does what he does very well. The performances he gets from the actors are brilliantly subtle and a joy to watch. Finally I found the music by James Newton Howard so moving that I went and bought the CD as soon as I could. I know opinions are split on Shyamalan's films but after this I cant wait for 'Lady in the Water'. Go see this film but don't expect the scary monster movie it was promoted as at the time of release.",The Village
1232,elenamjones,One problem I noticed...(small spoilers),6,27 January 2005,"I thought this movie was okay, I like movies that make you think, but I noticed a contradiction in the movie. Although they had no contact with the world they had everything they needed to get by in the village. For instance their clothes. Where did all the people in the village get there clothes through the years. They didn't look equipped from what we saw in the film to produce so ,much material. Flour too, I never saw any fields of wheat or a miilery to grind the flour. These are just two very basic things that they seemed to have plenty of without adequate explanation. All the other luxuries like lamps and dishes for example I would assume they are limited to what the first 'settlers' brought with them but in time stuff like that gets broken, or families grow and you need more of them. This would be a problem eventually. Anyway, if anyone can explain the cloth and the flour I'd be grateful.",The Village
1233,skscott_1,Worth a Second Look.,8,30 January 2005,"This movie is definitely worth a second look. It is of a rare breed of films that are vastly better to view the second time around, when all the expectations, hype and surprise of the film are relieved. If the author/director of this film was unknown and no misleading trailer was ever shown, I believe that this would have been rated much higher based on the merits of the film and story itself. This is a well-written, well-acted piece of theater that is best viewed without a preconceived notion of the adventure or outcome.Upon first viewing, the movie simply did not live up to my expectations. I remember coming out of the theater feeling disappointed at this movie, and rightfully so. It did not live up to expectations of a Sixth-Sense revelation to be sprung on the viewer somewhere close to the end, and upon learning from the trailers that M. Night Shyamalan was doing horror, I was expecting some jaw-tightening tension that was not supported by the viewing.However, upon seeing this film a second time, the depth of the story, the superior acting and the colorful photography stands out as remarkable.",The Village
1234,BigAd,A nearly perfect Masterpiece,9,28 October 2005,"This movie is not what you expect it to be. First of all this is not a horror movie. So if you are looking for simple scares go watch another movie. There are scares in the film but they are there to support the story, they have a purpose.The Village instead relies on deep believable characters who are developing throughout the movie, combined with a wonderful love story and the question about the meaning of love and hope for the purpose of our life.The story is surprising, I'm not gonna spoil anything for you now, watch it yourself. But if you've seen some of M. Night Shyamalan's movies you know how good his plots are and this movie is no exception.The great soundtrack, relying on a piano and a single violin, excellently matches the tone of the movie. I cannot think of a better way to strengthen the feelings of the audience.The acting is just wonderful. Bryce Dallas Howard as blind Ivy Walker is very believable and so is Joaquin Phoenix as the shy Lucius Hunt. The chemistry between those two actors is simply right. The rest of the cast also does a great job. This helps a great deal to make the movie believable.A must-see if you ask me. Just don't expect a horror film. 9/10 Stars",The Village
1235,stephafoss,Unique Experience,10,26 October 2004,"I liked The Village a lot. I liked the superb score (I'm listening to it right now) that gives a lot of its ambiance to this movie. I liked the acting of Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrien Brody, Judy Greer and the adults (William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver). I completely fell for the story, and just let the movie take me wherever it was going, it was a very nice experience. I was often scared, and sometimes moved. I almost cried when Noah was killed. I liked the reflection on how much should you protect your children from the ""real"" world, even at the cost of their own lives. It makes you think that you cannot shield yourself from the bad and try to live in a ""perfect' world, as madness, sadness and pain are a part of life. You got to deal with it sooner or later. I liked the fact I was still scared to death even if I was explained all was fake. Music an images can fool your brain, and this director knows how to do that very well. Overall, I liked this movie a lot. well done!",The Village
1236,whoooooopi,The Village is Tired,4,30 July 2004,"While the premise for ""The Village"" is familiar, yet captivating...tried, but true...the twists and turns not only fail to deliver...they utterly undermine everything that could have made this a wonderful film. Fans looking for a suspenseful tale about monsters in the woods and a small town dealing with the color red are likely to be disappointed by M. Night Shyamalan's direction and writing. The story will satisfy until about a half hour into the film, when most viewers will begin to predict where M. Night's ""mind-twists"" are going to go, after being subjected to only a few very obvious clues. While Phoenix shines in his sadly small role (and Bryce Howard likewise turns in a performance that promises more good things to come), no amount of good acting can survive drowning in the sound of collective audiences slapping themselves on the forehead as the disappointments land home and then just keep on coming. M. Night...your gift is bringing magic back into theaters again (Signs and 6th Sense). Why oh why would you pull the magic from what could have been a very enchanting fairy tale?",The Village
1237,juan-hansen,Touching and resonant,8,30 March 2012,"The Village, Shyamalan's sixth film, is about people who live in a small, close knit utopian community, which resembles the Amish. They are surrounded by a forest that is inhabited by mysterious creatures. A truce exists between the creatures and the villagers that says that neither one shall enter the other's territory. However, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to go into the woods, and he asks the Elders if he can do so. He is turned down, but mysterious creatures enter the village, leaving red marks on the doors.At the end of the day, Shyamalan and the marketing team at Touchstone use this to get asses in the seats (on a side note he is very good at creating stories with a commercial backdrop - not many filmmakers can write intimate stories that offer commercial appeal at the same time), but that's not really what the movie is about. The Village is really a love story that personifies what love truly is, and not just some superficial word people throw around. A love triangle exists in the film, which is very reminiscent of many of Shakespeare's plays.One of the best and most touching scenes in the movie takes place between Lucius and the divine Bryce Dallas Howard's (daughter of director Ron Howard, who gives a tour de force debut performance by the way) character, Ivy, in a conversation where Lucius confesses his love for her. Another of Night's strengths is creating a very subtle and resonant mood and dialogue without seeming pretentious or melodramatic. Ultimately, this movie explores how love gives us courage and makes us do things we are otherwise afraid to do.",The Village

I will try not to say much, for I do not wish to give away anything. I do agree, the previews are quite misleading, but it gave a better edge and experience to the movie not knowing what was to come.I went to a midnight showing with a friend, and we were both equally frightened. I was also moved by the sweet romance that was interweaved into the movie. I loved the acting by Bryce Dallas Howard, her first performance was one to show she is a great actress. I also loved the acting by Joaquin Phoenix and Adrien Brody.I hope people can enjoy this movie experience as much as I did.",The Village
1239,kletson0503-347-304699,The Village,2,18 April 2012,"In 2004 I found myself in a theater waiting on a film that was sure to be entertaining. The trailers had enticed me for months and I was giddy about seeing this intriguing piece of art. Since that day I have tried to block out the utter disappointment that followed the theaters dimming lights. Up until, The Village, I truly enjoyed many M. Night Shyamalan films. Like most, The Sixth Sense was a delightful experience in the puzzle-thriller genre and I never looked at a farm house the same after Signs. With Night's track record I was not expecting disappointment. The Village did not just fall short of my expectations; it tumbled from the summit of Mount Everest. The Village is not just flawed in one area, but is a nest egg for disaster. This film at first glance has a great cast however, that does not guarantee great acting. William Hurt for the majority of the film seems as if he is reading directly from a script, while Joaquin Phoenix comes off as dry and emotionless as ever. All cannot be blamed on lack luster acting; the characters being portrayed are extremely unrepeatable to ANY audience member- unless the audience is packed full of disturbing cult leaders. While the characters are completely forgettable and come with no audience attachment, the concept of this film is by far the most inadequate area of The Village. I have never seen a more ridicules storyline. Somehow Shyamalan thought it made sense to have parents traumatize there kids for the sake of keeping them secure in a phony plastic bubble set in the late 1800's. M. Night Shyamalan really dropped the ball on The Village. I have never walked out of a theater so disappointed (and I have seen Twilight). The Village ruined M. Night's films for me. I now see his name attached to a project and run the other way. After this atrocity, it is almost a shame to call M. Night Shyamalan an auteur director.",The Village
1240,orestes1,Very unfortunately advertised completely incorrectly,10,11 January 2005,"The film The Village, was quite unfortunately Mal advertised, this being in Greece of course. Instead of showing the ingenuity of the plot and the sort utopia created, it depicts a cheap horror story. This accomplished two very inopportune things. Firstly it attracted quite a unimaginative unintelligent crowd of people, who were, of course, displeased by the outcome of the story. Secondly it didn't allow the more imaginative more interpretive crowd to enjoy the quite complacent plot and Walden Two like utopia ultimately falling apart the sole reason people never left the place was due to their fear of some unknown creature.It was well done, had a good group of productive actors and a very suspenseful plot and deserves better reviews than it is given.",The Village
1241,CSFiction,Shyamalan shows his range,10,31 July 2004,"First off, lemme say this...if, IF you have friends (or you) who go to a movie for a bunch of explosions, or an overly-climatic ending, do not go to this movie with them (Or yourself). That being said, this is classic Shyamalan, proving once more that he is the master of atmosphere, sure, its not too scary (as say, The Sixth Sense was) but this is a movie that will keep your heart pumping from the first ten minutes until the end credits. I can't go into too much detail, for fear that I might clue too heavily to the ending (However, I will tell this, it is a bit predictable, but a fact that is easily overlooked). I will say this: The Village is a film that will only speak to a small crowd who can identify with the theme Shyamalan puts across about a person's fear of how the world is turning out, and what lengths they would go to to obtain and protect innocence.Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that Shyamalan has proven across his (6) movies that he can cover an amazing range and still make you think about life.That being said, if you rely on a Bruckheimer-esque explosion riddled, overly formulaic movie, run away from this movie, its far from something you'd come to expect from a summer blockbuster.",The Village
1242,MurdukRambo,About as bad as the Village People... **/5,3,17 January 2005,"Mr. Shyamalan is quite the director. In some ways, he has reached legendary status among movie goers. The Sixth Sense, while I didn't care for it as much, is regarded as one of the best and scariest movies of our time. His style of directing is almost of a post-modern Hitchcock style.I find movies lately that I watch are usually made or broken with the last 30 minutes. It sounds very shallow and it is. Now, thats not to say I don't appreciate the majority of the movie but the ending is what really leaves you with your final opinion of the movie. Take Unbreakable. Mr. Shyamalan wrote and directed a movie; a movie that was so slow and seemed to be going no where... Until you reached the end. In those last two minutes, you understood why you'd watched the movie. You watched the ending and wow, it sat with you.In fact, to clear things up so you don't totally discount my review, the end of a movie justifies the rest of it. And it is with this lengthy introduction that I begin my review of the Village.Now, as far as the Village, basically I think the Village wasn't really a BAD movie per-say. I didn't hate it. Truth be told, as I was watching it, I found myself kinda interested. Who knows? Maybe it was another Unbreakable... Until the end. The end did not justify the means, nor the means the end. And I hope to tell you why.-Sample Stuff One: The Village was disappointing.I was watching the preview again last night, and though I saw it twice, I almost wanted to see it again, until I remembered that the majority of the movie was a romantic film. Yes, it's true. The previews make this film look scary and suspenseful. Now, I won't discount that there were a few scenes that, on first view, make you feel kinda scared. But by the end, you won't have any trouble flicking off the light at night.Now, if this movie had been advertised as the romantic-drama it was, sure, i wouldn't have gone to see it but I could respect it for what it was. But, when you false advertise a movie like this and make it seem like the scare of the century, you draw blood.-Smaple Stuff 2: The twist had nothing on his other films.Now, I know some would beg to differ but I concur that the twists in The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs were phenomenal. To say this doesn't have a twist would be a lie. It has a twist... it's just not very good.The problem with the twist is it doesn't follow the same pattern as the other films.-SPOILERS- In the Sixth Sense, MNS told us a tale about Dead People and proved they were real.In Unbreakable, MNS told us a tale about Superheroes and proved they were real.In Signs, MNS told us a tale about Aliens and proved they were real.I won't tell you the twist of the Village but basically, it doesn't follow this formula that made these three films so great (in my opinion).-END SPOILERS- Sample Stuff 3: The acting was pretty good.My one praise for this film. The acting was nothing short of great. I wouldn't expect anything else with a star-studded cast like this but certainly, this film was well acted.If the film had any chance at the academy, I could see Bryce Dallas Howard being nominated for best actress. It's hard work portraying a blind girl (Ivy) and man, she hit it right on the dot.Before we go any farther, I should tell you a little bit about the story and like, I said, the concept was brilliant.Our story takes place in a 19th century Village where folks live in a community. No, we have no idea why they are there but they seem to be living well.Until we find out about those who live in the woods bordering the Village. It seems that there are monsters in the woods and if one crosses over into the woods, it means certain death for the person who violated the boundary, as well as sufferage for the whole town.The monsters also love the color red and to combat them, they paint the trees near the boarder yellow (where they got that, I don't know). And, the story is about Lucius, the town adventurer who is quiet as a mouse and Ivy, the out-going blind girl hooking up. Did that last part throw the movie out the door for you? I hope so because the twist isn't worth the drama you have to go through.If you know the film is a drama and are still game for it, heck, do what you want! In fact, I encourage you check it out. But don't expect to be scared.If you think you'd like to see this film but it sounds to scary, I assure you, it isn't. My mom thought it sounded evil and later, she saw it and loved it (she's more of a drama person. :-)).Also, on the note of the twist, I still won't tell you what it is but it is hard to predict in that it is the first thing that would come to your mind.So, all in all, I didn't care for this movie. It was certainly one of Mr. Shyamalan's worst films (Wide Awake was pretty bad too but, we don't speak of that). By no means was this a horrible movie, but, you'd be better off with the Young Men at the Y.M.C.A. ;-)",The Village
1243,rockymt89,Why it was bad,2,4 August 2004,"It was not scary. We have seen this movie a few other times, called 6th sense and unbreakable. Come up with something new! The actors and actresses were great but the story line was just not there. I, like most other people in the movie theatre were expecting something totally different. Which would be OK as long as it were better then what they expected. This was by no was better then what I expected. This story line has been use to many times. The movie was slow to develop and then when it did it took off so fast that if you had left to go get something to drink by the time you got back the movie would have been over. The only reason it was #1 in the box office was because of how it was written by. Trust me this is the last week it will be number #1. Try and cut your losses and send it to video.",The Village
1244,ndc3,Brilliantly crafted,10,18 August 2004,"Night has done it again. He knows how to rope in his audience and spin his stories. He has woven a beautiful tale that had me on the edge of my seat. This was not really a horror movie; the movie simply uses the horror angle as a vehicle, as all Night's movies do, to deal with delicate issues such as love and the extent to which some will go to protect and preserve life in the name of love. The movie parallels the love interests of several of its main characters in a very clever and subtle way, which I found most enjoyable. The ending was somewhat of a surprise, but it fit well with the remaining pieces of the movie. I thought this movie flowed much better than some of his previous films, although I have enjoyed them all. I will be seeing this movie again.",The Village
1245,keh917,Waste of Time and Money,3,22 August 2004,"I went into this movie thinking the best but was let down. The appearance of the ""creature"" looked to be of a C rate horror flick and the movie was about as bad as Blair Witch Project. The ""truth"" of the town was revealed too soon and viewers were left with nothing to wonder about for the rest of the movie. Use your money to see something else. The movie was anti-climatic from the start as Shyamalan took too much time building the story, but then never delivered. I thought Signs was half way decent, but was a let down after the creatures were revealed. The Village is the same format, but the creatures were revealed much sooner leaving the viewers nothing to fear. Bottom Line: Shyamalan tries too hard.",The Village

It had no suspense, a terrible plot, and the only things that scared anyone in the theater were the loud noises. These loud noises served no purpose. One of them is when a ""creature"" walks under the guard tower. A very loud drum sounds, and scares people at a scene that is completely undeserving of such startling sounds. SPOILER ALERT!! When I found out that the creatures were fake I thought it might lead somewhere and would possibly be interesting, but they screwed that up too.

The film itself was good the location r great and the story before the end was brilliant maybe not as good as say tha 6th sense, but still very good,I do believe though that Phoenix didn't have a big enough part in the film and that an outstanding performance by Howard even though she is not the best blind person Now i understand what happened the story is great and the twist is quite good.

1248,stormhame,A MAJOR Letdown.....,1,1 August 2004,"The worst movie I have seen of the summer. THE WORST! And don't send me some e-mail saying I'm hateful to M. Night Shyamalan, because I'm not. I LOVE his movies(except this one) and was looking forward to this movie for a long time. I'm also one of the ones who knew about the leaked script and read it. I was also disappointed by this script.The Village is about a small village in Pennsylvania, around the late 1800s. The villagers with in live in the knowledge of strange creatures that are just outside their border. Lucius Hunt(Phoenix) wishes to leave the village and journey into the woods. Edward Walker(Hurt) and the other elders(Weaver, Gleeson, etc...) are not so enthusiastic about this idea. A love story follows between Lucius and Ivy Walker(Howard).One thing that ruins this film: BORING! This film was completely false advertised as a thriller and scary. If you want to see all the scary parts, watch the trailers again, because that's all of 'em. Scary, eh?And the twist. (Groan) Oooooooohhhhh, the twist. I ain't going to say anything, but when I read the script, I could have guessed it a mile away. And seeing this movie, it was like reading the script all over again. Lemme tell ya, if you've read the script, don't bother. I mean, yeah, there are so major changes, but basically it's the same. You will still be disappointed. No, I take it back, it's not the boringness that ruins this film, it's the twist. This film is so caught up in its twist, that it fails to answer its own question and kinda leaves you there hanging. Well, Night, that may have worked in Total Recall, but you obviously couldn't pull it off here, because it left me feeling totally cheated, and wondering ""What did I just see? Did that have a point to it, or was Night just stringing me along to go BOOM! here's a twist. Answer the questions yourself."" I'm sorry, Night, but I don't wanna guess at stuff and guess what just happened. I wanna know. FOR SURE. Not leave 500000000000 open questions that leave you so confused you just say, ""Forget it. Not wasting my time pondering about a stupid movie.""As Jordann Pundik sang in 2's and 3's:""Stupid games are for stupid people and they end just like a song A song with no beginning A song that has no meaning""Night was definitely playing a stupid game, and I'm not sure if it really had a meaning worth looking for.",The Village
1249,AntiWinner22,What happened? *Spoilers*,5,3 August 2004,"My friends and I wanted to go see a film one Saturday night. My friend wanted to see ""I, Robot,"" but I wanted to see ""The Village"" as I had liked Night's previous works ""Signs"" and ""Unbreakable."" Boy, did I get a verbal beating after the film was done.First and foremost, this film was advertised incorrectly. I expected a similar experience to that of ""Signs,"" not a journey into the structure of our violent society. Now, for the film.The story starts off with the death of a young boy in the late 19th century. A young man, Phoenix, decides to go through the forbidden forest, inhabited by ""those we don't speak of,"" to garner medicines for the town. From here, it is downhill. To get to the actual journey it takes the film about an hour and ten minutes. I am not joking. The first hour is mostly a backdrop for the central conflict that begins at 1:10. This is simply UNACCEPTABLE for a film. This leaves the film only 30 minutes to finish both the conflict, with a climax, mind you, AND the conclusion.The funny thing is that the climax is longer than both the conflict and the conclusion. Why? The conflict between the one on the journey and ""those we don't speak of"" takes about 10 minutes. 20 minutes are given for the climax, and there are 0 minutes for the conclusion. You will feel angry that the film ends with no conclusion.Now, this wouldn't make a movie; I am sure someone could contend that there have been great movies with this sort of timescale. The problem is that the way that the movie is presented, you are expecting to get every bit of info now as opposed to later. Basically, the only thing that is stopping you from leaving the theater is the cost of your entry.I WANTED this movie to be good. I expected much more than just a 30 minute movie. I hope that Night will learn from this unholy mistake.",The Village
1250,mica_wrensong,A truly chilling horror film -- but not how you think,6,8 July 2012,"******* SPOILER ALERT ******* If you have not seen the film, do NOT read this review, as it WILL ruin the signature Shyamalan surprises for you, but I hope you will come back and read my review after you've seen the movie. Thanks!It is no surprise that this movie, like all Shyamalan films, is well-crafted -- beautifully directed, cast, and filmed -- and thought-provoking. However, I give this movie a 6 because of the ending and its underlying message. Based on the lackadaisical, ""we'll-just-continue-as-we've-gone-before"" ending he gives it, Shyamalan does not seem to realize the true horror that he has created, namely, a fictitious utopian community with well-intentioned elders that have achieved their ends through deceit and terrorism. Yes, terrorism, folks. Does no one, even Shyamalan, see the chilling implications of the social engineering in this story? From what I can tell, no one else reviewing this movie here, nor anyone I know who has seen it, seem to get that point. People compare the Village to the Amish, but aside from a seemingly idyllic, simple life, the similarities stop there. People living in Amish communities know full well what the real world around them is like. Certainly, they view the rest of the world through the tinted glasses of their own beliefs, upbringing, and experiences, but at least they know that they live in the modern era and have a pretty good idea of what's out there. In fact, the Amish encourage their young adults to go out into the real world for a short time, experience it, and decide where they want to be, although most end up returning to the fold. Does the Village do that, allow their young people to make their own decisions about which world they want to live in? No. They don't tell them much about that other world at all.Donning monstrous costumes to scare the living daylights out of your own families and weaving intricate lies meant to keep them where you want them is terrorism, plain and simple, and this is a small-scale totalitarian situation. People living in the Village are not allowed to leave if they want to, and to be independent and brave enough to attempt it, like Lucius Hunt, is to court trouble. Granted, Lucius is not beaten. He is not thrown into prison. The elders listen to him. They even sympathize with him. But nevertheless, they use underhanded tactics and threats to keep him and the rest of the village in ignorance and fear. Forget that they live in an idyllic world, based on the simple life -- this is a prison, and they don't even know it. Is that idyllic, simple life, really worth so much? There are countries on this planet that use the same tactics on their own citizens, and other, reasonable, liberty-loving people seem to have no problem despising those governments. The Village is no different -- just on a smaller scale -- and yet people just don't seem to get it, including Shyamalan himself.So, rather than rewarding Lucius and Ivy for their courage and independence, Shyamalan draws them right back into the lies, along with everyone else. Ivy now thinks that the beasts really do exist because she encountered and killed one. The elders agree with each other that they will uphold the lie and continue with what they have built -- continue keeping their people in the dark. In the end, nothing has changed at all, except that maybe they won't have to wear those scary costumes as much as before. M. Night Shyamalan's message here seems to be that the ends justify the means, that the collective is more important than the individual, and that deception, terrorism, and ignorance are acceptable means of keeping individuals in line, making this a chilling horror story indeed.",The Village

Well, that isn't the movie's fault, it is your fault for having different expectations about the movie and letting that ruin a good story. Come on, it is a M. Night Shyamalan movie, it is going to have some kind of twist to it and the whole movie turned out to be the big twist. So stop whining like little babies because he fooled your expectations.

1252,esin2000,do you have answers to these questions?,5,20 December 2004,"Hi everybody. Maybe i was just too bored in the movie so i missed some points. But until DVD is released,i won't be able to see it again so can someone answer my questions? I don't want to call the movie a disaster before i get the answers. (it there are any)1. Let me see if i got the whole thing right;some people decided to create this ""village"" to protect their loved ones after they all suffered of violence in today's world and met at a support group. They somehow had great financial and political power that the area was isolated from any kind of flights (private,amateur flights,military jets,any sort of...),media,visitors and everything. Before they entered the village,they had some professional monster costumes made,wooden houses and furniture built,land prepared for planting and all the other equipments to start a new isolated life. Wow,that's a huge project! Who on earth can have such a power?2. What is the thing with the forbidden color? What's the sense in getting rid of everything in RED color? I honestly couldn't understand it.3. ""Blind girl loves the adventurous boy. He gets stabbed. She has to go to find antibiotics"" So this is the only time that this community ever needed something form the outside world in 20 years?! No woman needed medication while giving birth to a baby! No one ever had a major house accident,a very deep cut or infection! No child fell from a high tree and had a seriously broken bone that needed surgery!4. Did the guards outside the woods knew anything about the inside? If not,how could the guard who found Ivy be very understanding and helpful to her? What if he didn't pass from that point until the other day? 5. Aren't there any lawyers or so outside,taking care of the property's lasting? Wouldn't it make sense if Ivy's father (who is the founder of the project) went out and got in touch with them from time to time? Why send Ivy for the medicine?6. If the boys hadn't left Ivy alone,what would happen? The boys would see everything that Ivy couldn't see behind the walls,a strange man wearing strange clothes,using a talking machine,riding a strange vehicle... Was the village lucky that the boys left her alone,so that she went & came back without noticing the outside world? Now the village can go on?7. At a scene William Hurt said ""we knew it would end someday"" to Sigourney Weaver. What did the elder people think would happen when it ended? How would the young generations (born & raised in the village) get over the shock? They will all have great psychological problems. Is it worth it? To build a world of lies to protect them from crime? How sick-minded can they be?8. Am i taking the movie too serious? Should i just call it fiction and stop trying to think that it must make sense? Maybe the answers were in the movie and i missed them. Generally I am not a lousy watcher,really.",The Village
1253,danshulen,Great but not for everybody,8,1 August 2004,"When I finished watching this movie I thought it was a very good movie but I noticed most people were complaining about the movie. Since it was on a Saturday night, most of the people there were teenagers who I guess were looking for a movie to scare them. This film is not for everybody, but for the select few who can enjoy an M. Night story. It has some scary scenes but I don't think as a whole it was a scary movie. This film was more like the Unbreakable style than anything. I would recommend it to big M. Night fans.

1254,LavianoTS386,WARNING SPOILERS,1,31 July 2004,"I put a spoiler warning...but seeing this film is perhaps the worst spoiler. The film reminded allot of Ayn Rand's book, ""Anthem"" if you took out some pages and spit on it. In fact I'd say Ayn Rand was better at characterization than M. Night.I agree with others that it was a good idea, but sadly poorly executed.We spend what seems like an eternity fallowing this man, Luscious. He is actually likable and has extreme potential...and then the film's resident fruitloop, Noah, stabs him. Noah has no motivation...he's just a literal basket case. This happens in the middle of the film.There are a lot of plot threads that do not mesh, like how the girl's sister wanted to marry Luscious, but was denied.The film gives it's self away by showing that the monster is only a suit, before she goes into the forest. It happens too soon, thus turning what was a really scary creature early on into a scare less tact.It's devoid of any urgency or mystery once Luscious is injured. These people supposedly have no medicines yet Luscious is alive when he really should be dead.Other senseless disasters from this film include, Noah dieing in the woods still within the suit, yet when the two boys come to tell the members of the counsel that they found him, the kids apparently didn't notice that Noah was inside the ""creature"" suit, when he died w/o the head piece on.All other the ""elders"" where graduates from a help center, if the help center where any good they shouldn't have become anti-social and create this ""Village"" in the first place.Wouldn't it have been easier to join the Amish? And is this kind of 'Village' really lacking that much security? If I climbed that fence what would the APF do, shoot and risk a bullet going into the village?Don't see this film unless you enjoy disappointments and like watching characters that are unlikable.",The Village
1255,Jianna,"The less you know, the better it will be.",10,2 August 2004,"Someone told me before seeing The Village that the less you know about the film going in, the better it will be. I took this advice to heart and thoroughly enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie. Though it is a little slow-moving in places and Night would have done well to shave off about fifteen minutes of 'village stuff' that really wasn't that important to the plot, it was still excellent and held my interest through the entire two hours. Though the twists in the film did not make me jump out of my seat or gasp in astonishment, I didn't expect them. However after they were revealed, you could see the careful planning and all the intricate tie-ins that the casual viewer would brush off as mere coincidence if it were anything but an M. Night Shyamalan film.The characters in this film were rich and interesting and made each and every scene remarkable and full of life. I was especially captivated by the stunning Bryce Dallas Howard who played the young blind woman named Lily and quite possibly the most captivating character in the entire story.This movie is worth seeing and worth seeing soon. Or else hiding in a closet until all the talk has died down. You do not want to know the twists until you see them for yourself because they won't seem as significant. Of course, most people won't take this bit of advice, but it's worth a shot.",The Village

Noone can honestly say, (like for Sixth Sanse) I knew it was going to end like this. And then when you have a look back on the whole story, everything becomes clear and logical.M.

Making this movie out to be a scary thriller, as usual with the Signs and Unbreakable. Horror fans continually get cheated by Night after the success of The Sixth Sense. This movie sucks so bad it should have been a TV movie. Night's twists since his first movie seem to be lame attempts to recapture his glory. He will never be as good as 6th sense again.

1259,obi_wants,Comprehensive Review,7,30 July 2004,"The VillageM. Night has thrilled audiences with three very solid movies in Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. As a fan of M Night, and movies in general, the line between the two when reviewing his movies is very difficult. I will do my best.In spite of Ebert's recent review that trashed this movie with a 1 star rating, I had to remain open minded. The first thing is, is Ebert reviewing the movie on the basis of other Night's movies, or is he reviewing based on movies as a whole? I have never felt comparing the other works of the director is effective, but Ebert as always seemed to do this. He gave Gangs of New York a not so positive review based on the fact that it did not reach the level of Goodfellas or Raging Bull. Do you think this is how you should review a movie? Now if he did review The Village as a movie on its own merit, than he rated the movie the same as White Chicks, Catwoman, and any other ridiculous movie. Does this seem fair? Was it really that bad? I watched the movie today....This is not a 1 star movie, but by no means a masterpiece. I felt the dialogue was a bit too lax and dry, and at times the movie moved really slow. It was not a long movie, yet it felt like the movie should have been cut up a bit. The cinematography was great, score was also good. But let's get a little more in depth.M Night's trademark twist has now left him with a label or brand. It's unfortunate that most people now watch his movies looking for that very twist. I prefer to look at his movies with conflict and swift climatic resolution. I believe that is true story telling and film making. In the Village, the resolution is visionary again, however I felt the execution was a bit off the mark. The audience was able to guess, or infer the end before the end. This wasn't a terrible thing; it was still fun to watch how it played out. I just think in this movie, they really could have gone with a planet of the apes (original) type resolution. That is, a bang at the end leaving audiences breathless. To do that though, you cannot give a lot away during the movie. The urgency to progress to the secret or ending seemed evident in the acting. While Brody played his character verywell, I didn't really seem to agree of him. He felt more like a plot tool than a character. And again, the urgency in Hurt, somewhat slanted the story.The movie has a short story feel to it. And that is maybe because it plays off the political foreground of today. Many connections can be made, and I will refrain from doing so for the sake of people who haven't seen it. Is it scary? The audience should jump a bit. As trademark M Night, not for what you see, but how little or what you don't see.This is a good movie, with a few problems and minor holes that who knows, may be fixed on 2nd viewing. But this is by no means a disaster. It is the weakest of his four major movies I feel, but no slouch either. A mediocre M. Night movie is still better than most. The best directors always make quality movies that are never atrocious. Scorsese, Spielberg, even Mann. Is M Night equivalent to Spielberg. Not yet, of course not. But my theory is that a director has to make at least 4 really good movies to be considered legendary. It's unfortunate that I cannot consider M night in this category at this point simply because The Village is not great, it's only above average. However, I ask viewers, since when is it a sin to make only a good movie? If anything, I hope it will allow fans and audiences to realize not to label and have preconceived notions of his movies, but instead to go with no expectations except for quality. I am also glad that his next movie is a book adaptation (Life of Pi) which should broaden him as a filmmaker. It would prove his uncanny storytelling ability by directing someone elses story.Rating: 3 Stars (out of 4)M Nights other moviesSigns: 3.5 stars Unbreakable: 3.5 stars Sixth Sense: 4 stars",The Village
1260,whiteflash124,Why all the Hostility?,10,9 August 2004,"I just got back from seeing The Village, and though many, many people said it was horrible, I liked it a lot. It had a good enough story, and still had the ""M. Night Shamalan"" mind blowing twists. Even though some of the things could have been improved (like the Creature in the woods could have looked a little less like a porky pine) over all it was a good story and movie and Bruce Howard did a good job as Ivy, the blind girl. I just wonder why so many people absolutely loathed this movie. Maybe it was because people expected another Sixth Sense that amazed you so much that you had to go see it again. Well, yes, it wasn't as spectacular as the Sixth Sense, but it did still live up to the M. Night Shamalan reputation.",The Village
1261,claireturbutt,"Surprising, interesting, subtle character acting.",7,24 August 2004,"Lucius (Phoenix) is the shy yet brave blacksmith in The Village, a place trapped by the presence of mysterious creatures in the woods which surround it. The creatures, against which the villagers must always be vigilant, will accept no incursion into their woods. This state of affairs manages both to protect the villagers from the outside world and make their lives within the village slightly more precarious. The only wrinkle in their perfect, crime free existence is the end of the medical supplies from the 'Towns' outside the woods. When a young child's life could have been saved by these medical supplies Lucius decides the time has come to brave the creatures wrath and enter the forest. But will his actions mean the end of the villages' existence in more ways than one?This is an interesting film, which tries to tackle the serious issue of fear as a control and trust in community leadership. How do we create a better world for our children? Serious questions but this film also has a sense of humour. The villagers all seem to make an effort to speak in a forced frontier version of American English. It is not clear whether this is poorly written dialogue or an intentional jarring to make you realize that there is something unnatural about the villagers and their cut-off way of life.The romance between Phoenix and Howard is the most absorbing part of the film; it is a real pleasure to watch the quiet Lucius and Tom-boy Ivy developing their relationship and eventually their actions lead to the films finale. Phoenix seems to have cornered the market on vulnerable insecure men emerging as leaders and Howard is just wonderful as the strong and independent Ivy.Some scenes don't reach the intensity the director was aiming for, but still the sentiment behind them is obvious. I found myself having to actively force my suspension of disbelief on some points, and the film could quite easily become unintentionally funny if you let it, this is especially so of our first sight of the creatures. If you go expecting a pioneer version of Predator or Alien you will probably be disappointed, but if you go looking for a gentle drama, well acted with a few boo scares along the way and some subtle insights into society you will enjoy this film.If you liked The Others, Cold Mountain or Signs this film is for you.",The Village

The actress who played the blind girl didn't seem particularly affected by being blind - she managed to go quite successfully on a mission to the'towns' - what was that all about?

1265,SamuelJacksonOftenDies,Classic M. Night,10,2 August 2004,"With the Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan re-ignited the use of the twist ending (which has been greatly overused since) and does not fail to create another suspense-filled movie that audiences love in ""The Village."" Using the recurrent setting of eastern Pennsylvania, M. Night's formula of unlikely heroes versus the unknown is flexed once again as a rural, isolated village managed by a council of elders lives with the imminent threat of monsters on their borders.Though lacking superstar performances from the likes of Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, or Mel Gibson, the cast of ""The Village"" is wonderful in this apparent period piece. William Hurt nails the role as the small town's leader and Joaquin Phoenix (who gained a certain amount of fame from ""Gladiator"" and M. Night's ""Signs"") plays the character of the quiet yet brave possible hero very well. However, the importance of Adrien Brody and Bryce Dallas Howard is downplayed in previews yet fit right into their positions as the hero and the unknown.Even though I basically predicted the ending from the preview and the commercials, I had no idea it would specifically end the way it did.Finally, as my friend commented, ""This is like a blind Blair Witch,"" I believe she is right in that many who see this movie will shudder a bit on next time entering the woods and seeing the color red.",The Village

If you get past the fact that this isn't the movie you thought it was going to be, I think you're in for a treat. The acting was fantastic, especially Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix. Adrien Brody's character was well intentioned but inappropriately funny to some of the crowd that I viewed the movie with. Add this to ignorance, I suppose, people do need to grow up.

1268,hippotim,SPOILER...One Gimmick After Another,1,1 August 2004,"After seeing 'The Village,' I would like to raise a few questions to those who saw it and perhaps try to show why it was not a good movie:1. What is the point of the movie? To show that the world is full of terrible things and that we should go live in the 1800s where the only thing to fear is some cattle skinning monsters?2. How in the world were 'the elders' able to build houses, give birth to at least 30-35 kids who in turn gave birth to even more, become expert farmers, and maintain being the monsters in the forest in the time of about 20-25 years? (as the photograph of them at the counseling center suggests)3. How did Noah, first of all, think to look under the floorboards of the room just this one time since we know he's been there before, know exactly how to use it, and run into the forest undetected?4. Why didn't William Hurt go through the forest instead of the blind girl (Ivy)? (He wouldn't have had to tell her about the truth of the monsters this way)5. How come the elders didn't think to bring some good medical supplies with them? What if someone had been impaled by a tree branch? Plus if they can hide a photograph of themselves in the secret ALUMINUM box, they can hide some supplies.-The only thing I can say that's good about this film is that it strikes up conversation, other than that it is highly irrelevant.",The Village
1269,ShakeZula,Not so much horror as thrilling drama,8,2 August 2004,"Yes, much like the many who had seen the previews for the movie on their televisions or computers or during other movies, I was half-expecting an 'oh my gosh, what is that?!' horror film. Imagine my surprise when I found myself more involved in the characters than I had expected to be from the outset. That being said, let me stress that I am not saying that Shyamalan does a poor job of developing characters, you need only look as far back as Unbreakable, in which I think he did a superb job. The characters in this movie were engrossing and I must say that not only did Bryce Dallas Howard look beautiful in this movie, I was very much moved by her performance as a blind daughter to the Village's head elder. At the theater I saw this at, which was in Boston, I sensed a lot of disappointment. But I didn't understand why. Yes, I know that many people, younger people especially, were expecting this to be a horror movie, as I said, however, I think the audience's downfall is its need to search for the meaning of the movie before the movie even starts. Lofty expectations abound, I think people were more disappointed because this movie wasn't what they think should have happened as opposed to the fact that this is a stupid movie. Yes, it probably was slower than what people wanted, but by no means did I think it was a stupid movie. Let me stress that I thought Shyamalan's latest effort was anything but stupid. And while the story and ultimately his signature ""twist"" has been seen before, I loved the way that he did this movie. Exceptional acting on the part of Phoenix and Howard and excellent atmosphere make The Village seem like more of a drama than a horror movie. I can't say that I am as disappointed with this movie as some of my fellow patrons. I think that while this movie did have its faults, it was a good telling of a story ages old.

1272,ShawntallicA,A theatrical buzzkill.,4,31 July 2004,"Ah, the all American summer movie. It is part of what makes this time of the year have the atmosphere that it does. Go to the theaters for fun, thrills, chills, and spills(?). But wow does it suck when you come across one that is a real killjoy. For those headed to your local cinema this weekend (July 30th  August 1st), chance are you went to go see THE VILLAGE, and was meant with the buzz kill of your summer-movie going experiences. Not all, mind you, but most.M. Night Shyamalan has made quite the name for himself coming to Hollywood with his first acclaimed film, the infamous SIXTH SENSE. Since then people will claim that his talent has decreased or that he has tried to hard, but I feel none are true as such accusations prove only opinion. SIGNS is often very maligned by others but I actually find it to be my favorite of M.'s films, so it is all a matter a choice. But I feel that when a movie is weak in comparison to past works, then it is weak and this was weak. And is also part of a strange dilemma that only Shyamalan could get into because of his talent as a writer and a director which is still apparently strong in his worse outing at the time of writing this.Slow, plodding, but rarely uninteresting you grow quite attached to the village and the villagers themselves, and deciding on the title of the movie is better fitted in its final form as 'The Woods' sets up a bit of different expectation. Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix), Ivy (Bryce Howard) and Noah (Adrien Brody) are the pivots in which this story turns and all are wonderfully developed. Secondary characters seem to get the proverbial shaft though as this is one of the largest casts M. Night has worked with thus far. Alice Hunt (Sigourney Weaver) and Edward Walker (William Hurt) were the only others of real interest and while you got the gist of what they were as folk in this town, there was no proper time to get to them like the many variety of characters Shyamalan has given us before. This especially sucks for me because I am a huge fan of Sigourney Weaver from her ALIEN days up through HEARTBRAKERS and HOLES.But no matter the actors, no matter how visionary the director is or the writing, when a story is left in a jumble there is nothing to save it. And a jumble this is. Things felt forced at times and at others felt truly ludicrous. I will not post any spoilers, but a rule of film in my opinion is to never just tell what is going on show it, let the audience think and have it unraveled in their minds instead of a character coming forth and saying flat out what the twist or trick is When this point comes in the movie, the rest is ruined in its wake because it was just too important of a detail. A detail in which this entire movie rides on since the beginning and ruins it in the end. I rate this movie a 4.5 out of 10. Still far from hating it, but even farther from loving it.",The Village

1274,Sir_Ferdival,Predictable and disappointing... it sucks!,3,30 July 2004,"This movie wasn't what I expected at all. It was slow moving and boring for the most part, the camera guy must've been drunk, and the parts that were supposed to be sad or touching were just plain funny. Not to mention that the damn movie had no ending. Half way trough the movie I had already figured out what was the ""secret"" of the village, making the las 30 minutes of the movie a torture. In my opinion... the movie plain sucked. Boring, not scary, and long. Not a good combination.MPAA: Rated PG-13 for a scene of violence and frightening situations. (Frightening... right! Gremlins is scarier than this sorry flick!).",The Village
1275,VinkerekniV,SPOILER --Not too bad,10,30 July 2004,"I liked this movie a lot. In fact, the more I think about it, the more I liked it. Definitely worth the $5.75. The plot was good, there was an amazing element of surprise... And I loved how this small, late 1800's(?) little village was set in the middle of the real, present day world. Amazingly thought out, I would definitely go and see it again. It's so amazing to think that he did other movies like Unbreakable, which was also an amazing movie. As well, The Village was a great name for it. Anything else would have been less fitting, and would probably have drove me not to want to see it. All in all a good movie, filled with thrill, drama, and suspense. I recommend it to all.",The Village
1276,jay643,I actually really liked it...,10,30 July 2004,"Contains Spoiler!! Haha I don't see why people are being so harsh with this movie...I loved it. I mean yeah, it wasn't a shock horror movie such as (Texas Chainsaw or Scream or any teen slasher movie) ...it was a thinking, psychological thriller commenting on how fear and imagination co-exist and how imagination creates fear that is or is not really there. For example...the sounds from the woods...they were just regular forest activity...but when told of the horrors of the woods people make them out to automatically be produced by some demon or creature that lives there. It's all in our minds. And that's what M. Night is toying with. He is toying with our mind...creating tense tense and scary situations instead of having a masked murderer run out and chop peoples heads off. He pulls his punches and only uses the surprises jumpy scenes to further mess with the audience...leaving them feel like it could happen at any time. They way he filmed each scene too...many times panning back the camera a bit and filming from a distance so that something could run in front of the camera at any moment...brilliant. I've heard a lot of mixed opinions about the ending too...haha i really liked it a lot. I love twist endings and I love movies that do not always take the logical path. I've read some pretty absurd statements out there already that people claim they guessed the ending 15 minutes into the movie...impossible, unless you cheated or read hints online that made you guess. I wanted the twist to hit hard and i wanted to be completely shocked by what it could be...I made sure I didn't read anything or even check anything about this movie up online. The only hints I had were the previews I saw on TV. How could you have honestly known (!SPOILER!, by this point though..if you're reading this..you probably already know) if you didn't have any outside help that it was set in the current times. I thought it was great. It basically switched genres in mid movie...going from a horror/thriller to, in a sense, an almost science fiction approach. (Note: Science Fiction is something that could possibly happen even if extremely implausible, Fantasy is something that could never ever happen) People need to expand their imaginations a bit more...think laterally. Sure you could sit through and eventually I'm sure you'll find some way that the situation their in could not have happened or that something hinted the twists, yeah, have fun with that. But, remember, movies are to entertain. I must say one last thing though, if you didn't understand the ending you missed the whole entire point of the movie. This movie was about imagination creating fear that wasn't there to begin with...and that's exactly what M. Night conveyed by twisting the ending. He made you believe, such as the people of the village believed, that there were horrors out in the woods that we should be frightened and scared of and that we should fear...but in the end we had nothing to fear. There wasn't anything out there...it had all been in our minds. The only actual real fear was when Noah was trying to kill Ivy. That was actually happening, it wasn't a set up that time. And it was interesting, and perhaps the other main point of the movie, that a town created entirely for the soul purpose of keeping these children innocent and away from harm had evil within itself too. There are irrational people out there no matter where...you can't escape them. Evil can come within as well. Being a filmmaker myself...I would have loved to make a movie like this. I would have loved to toy with the audience this much, would have loved to have the guts to totally go out on a wing for the ending. I thought it was just plain brilliant.",The Village

The Village was one of those films that was intense and exposed a clever message. I would like to say 'Well done', to all the actors, especially Adrien Brody and Bryce Dallas Howard. I do understand why some moviegoers were disappointed with the film. I believe that the trailers of the movie set it up mainly as a HORROR film, when i believe it was mainly a drama/thriller. I did however think the movie was creepy and I jumped a couple of times. My advise to people who haven't watched the movie yet is to open up your mind and go beyond what your seeing on film and get the big picture. I rate this movie 8/10.",The Village
1281,AlexMovie,The boogie-man is more scary than this movie.,2,30 July 2004,"This movie had potential. A lot of it. Unfortunately, all the building in the first twenty minutes leads to... a dramatic... nothing.This movie is really a predictable love story with two very predictable scary moments. Every other ""tense"" moment -- and the eons between them -- would be perfect fodder for Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. As the girl next to me screamed at the ""scary"" monsters, I couldn't help but laugh. (I hope Ann Roth can get some reuse value on her monster costumes -- they would be kinda cool Halloween costume rentals for a college party.)*** BEGIN SPOILER REVIEW ***The evil monsters are revealed for their true colors way to early, and the voice overs from previous scenes only insult the viewers who are always one step ahead of the story.Suffice it to say that this 1700s New England settlement is not what it appears. Unfortunately, the mystery is not preserved very long and there are not enough twists in the story. As the heroine seeks to embark on a mission to save the life of her husband-to-be, the outcome is too obviously foreshadowed by means of revealing the settlement's dirty secrets. Viewer confusion sets in as this foreshadowing begins to appear in flashbacks. (Yes, the past is in the future is in the past... got that?)Thankfully, normal time flow soon resumes, but all pretense of scariness has been eliminated for the remaining fifty minutes of the film. The film's finale is straightforward and lacks any remote attempt at playing with the viewers' minds.In the final scene, as the girl returns from her mission, the only question remaining is whether her efforts would actually save her fiancé. We'll never know, because the scene fades to black and the credits roll (with cheesy stage bill titles) before we learn the outcome of her (and our) lackluster journey.Basically, by the time you are thirty minutes into the film, you will believe you know the ending... and you'll be exactly right. I can think of more exciting ways to burn six dollars... light them up with a match. Better yet, rent a couple MST3k flicks from the local video store and enjoy them with friends in the comfort of home!(By the way, the damp mood of this film was in no way enhanced by Showplace 7's poor theater conditions... the A/C was running on low and one could cut the humidity with a butter knife.)",The Village

Well let me tell you that Night's ads portraying this movie's plot to be a scary and suspenseful, sci-fi thriller have been nothing but a bunch of misleading propaganda so he can make money off a reputation from his other movies. It is poorly written, is almost comical in parts, and leaves you wondering if this is the all-time worst movie EVER!I truly believe that Night's movies are now written for the sole purpose of enticing the audience into a game of playing ""Find the Director,"" so we can all find what little part he wrote himself into this time. And oh by the way, if you want to get the soundtrack for this movie, I suggest getting Signs (if there is one.) THE SAME BACKGROUND MUSIC.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!

There will never be another Sixth Sense because we're all looking for twists now. However, to his credit, Shyamalan continues to develop his craft as a story teller in the grand fashion of Hitchcock. My viewing of the movie was marred by a vast sea of giddy, giggling teenage girls who must have thought they were in for some teen slasher flick. Even that wasn't enough to detract from the spellbinding visual quality of The Village. What difference does it make even if you guess the end or think it's ""predictable""? Shyamalan has gone beyond that. His work needs to be judged not by horror standards but by literary ones. He is a superb story teller. The love story was unique and powerful. The theme of love and protection intertwined -- a rich subtext which pushes Ivy to a different response than the one taken by her elders when they had to deal with protecting the ones they love. Sometimes to protect we turn inward; sometimes we must turn outward.I'll be just as happy when all the ""disappointeds"" finally just hop off the Shyamalan bandwagon so that people with more subtle sensibilities can watch all his sure-to-come destined-to-be-classic-in-spite-of-current-opinion films in a more respectful atmosphere.",The Village

If only people would relax their critical, idealistic attitudes, allow themselves to enjoy being told a story, and just ride the wave of imagination, this movie is well worth a viewing. It WILL scare you at times, if you let it. You WILL care about the characters, especially Ivy, if you let yourself, and you WILL be surprised at the end, if you want to be. I mean c'mon, you paid for the ticket, let the man entertain you. It's not hard. He does it well, in my opinion, with this movie. Shyamalan does with his movies what Stephen King does with written words, that is, draws a warm, soapy, poignantly pungent bath of eerily abstract imagery and unfamiliar sensations into which those who experience them can immerse themselves and emerge refreshed and cleansed of the tedium of normal life.Don't see this movie with teenagers.

Simple minded people will not appreciate the artistry of this movie. It does require you to think a little. Which honestly not many movies do too well these days. For some, it may take some time after the movie for it all to sink in. And possibly even multiple viewings - which is a good thing. It adds to its lasting impression once you do finally figure it all out. The movie is not severely complicated though. It just has small intricacies that may not all add up for some after movie is over. But once you do get all the little details and why certain things are done the way they are, you will appreciate what M. Night has done with this movie.This movie has gotten plenty of bad reviews. It isn't quite as easy to understand and appreciate as 6th Sense, Unbreakable or Signs. But it is a simple fact that it is one cleverly crafted script that, if your open to it, will blow your mind. Even after I saw the movie, and thought I picked up on everything, 2 more major things hit me about an hour after the movie ended which was icing on the cake for me of how great of a movie this really is.If you are looking for a simple horror movie, The Village may very well disappoint you.

I should have waited and rented this movie on Pay-Per-View instead of paying top dollar to see this uneventful film.Bryce Howard, however, was the highlight of this film.

The ""twist"" is hardly shocking and the ten-year-old in front of me had it figured out in the first few minutes. If you want to see a smart, suspenseful, scary movie, this is definitely not it. Maybe M. Knight shouldn't have spent so much time stroking his own bloated ego, and a little more time writing a decent script.

Perhaps if I wasn't led to believe this was a scary movie I might have enjoyed it a little more.The ultimate message of the story being love conquers all?

Night Shyamalan, appears and now the movie takes a whole new dynamic.By this time you know the basic plot from numerous reviews and I really can't expound much more on the storyline.What needs to be understood is that there is always more to M.Night Shyamalans movies then a good suspense/thriller with a twist at the end. His stories are thought out, tantalizing and always have an underlining moral and/or political statement concerning our present situations. If you loved Sixth Sense and Signs and want to have your fears of ghosts and aliens played out again and again--you will not like this film. (even though there was way more to both of these films, people only get the ""basic"" story and that is why they love these movies) If you love horror/thrillers like scream, that are mindless, bloody and filled with horrible acting and gorgeous people--you will hate this film.If you have liked all of M. Night Shyamalans films, including Unbreakable, you will love this film and be talking for hours afterwards!!!When The Village is over and you don't feel scared and a need to start questioning and pondering what you have been told about life, community, family, religion and country.

Given just enough information in the most tantalizing bits and pieces to keep me guessing. The characters were strong but not obvious and there were lots of little sub-plots adding depth and dimension. The mythos presented was unknown but still complete and understandable. I was genuinely spooked a couple of times. Subtle, exciting, and entirely enjoyable. I think this is an excellent example of modern day storytelling - using the visual aspect of film instead of dialogue or soliloquies to tell vital points.

He should have given explanations and as a result, the plot lines of his movies do not give you closure with the film. If anything, you have more questions than the beginning. Maybe he got lucky or something with The Sixth Sense, because the movies he made after that are just terrible. There was maybe one scene that made you jump, but there no truly horrific or suspenseful scenes in the movie.

It may not be a film to see if one is the typical Hollywood formula lover, rather it is a return to films similar to those from the silent era that relied on techniques beyond the actors (eg., creative scenery, camera angles, use of music, and other things). Lastly, I would recommend this film to any that appreciate the film-making styles of Dave Mammet, this is something that is a must see beyond the boundary of just a plot. I think M. Night hit this one right on. And in the style of Mammet, M.

However, Shyamalan has a knack for creating meaning and depth in even the most mundane circumstances. The story itself is not what made this film so enjoyable and so interesting. Shyamalan is an incredibly stylistic director in the way Tarantino is. This movie reflects the nuances of Shyamalan just like Kill Bill did. Ostensibly their movies do not necessarily revolutionize or break ground like some would desire but they are simply examples of very skillful film making. From the costuming, to the cinematography, to the acting, the Village was the visualization of a classic story. Bryce Howard steals the show and this movie is her stage. The entire cast is very skilled but some of the supporting characters seem a bit subdued. If anything, the story could have been longer and a bit more fleshed out but thats not what Shyamalan wanted.

It is a small story, well-acted, but not worth a theater admission price. M. Night Shyamalan is trading on his Sixth Sense credentials, which admittedly are impressive, but he needs to work a lot harder than this to maintain a passionate fan base. It seems like the studios are letting him do whatever he wants in order to attach his name to a project. He wrote, produced and directed this movie.

If the beast actually was real it would have been a good movie hell even if it wasn't real and they just wanted to keep the people in the village for their own stupid reasons that would have been fine too but the little experiment they play to keep these people back in the days of the quakers while the rest of the world is modern day is the worst plot line i have ever seen. Honestly the movie was tripe but it was saved by one thing and that is adrian brodie, i mean how good is it to see him play a role he was born to play, a retard.

Unbreakable I hated, but managed to appreciate the artistry and what he was trying to accomplish. Signs was not at all what I expected it to be, but I really enjoyed it and rather liked that it turned out to be a character study (with some laughs and a few scares) rather than a monster movie.On to ""The Village"" which feels, actually, like a C-grade adaptation of a Shirley Jackson story. The acting is wooden, the ""twist"" is easily discernible within the first 30 minutes, and the film has utilized editing (and not well) in order to fill in substantial gaps in the story.Despite its flaws, I might have liked this movie had Touchstone obviously not turned its PR department on full-force to get people into the theaters by building it up to be something it obviously was not and if the movie, when all was said an done, was satisfying in any way. It is very obvious that the execs at Disney saw this film and went ""how the heck are we gonna sell this? It's slow, nothing happens, and the story is really derivative?"" They concocted their marketing plan (including the whole documentary on M. Night, I'm sure) based on M. Night's ""thrill factor"" and implemented it, but the movie they were tricking everyone into seeing is not in any way strong enough to counter the anger of movie goers who, like myself, felt cheated. And let me be clear: I didn't feel cheated because the movie wasn't a scary, monster movie. I felt cheated because this didn't even turn out to be an interesting character study or a pleasant diversion from the work week. It fell flat in every way, from writing to acting to execution.Well, Disney got its big opening.",The Village

I saw Harold and Kumar, which I thought would be dumber than Dude, Where's My Car, the other night because The Village was sold out and it was actually funny. But The Village didn't deliver what was promised. I didn't care about any of the characters, the premise was cool but wasn't followed through with because of the love story. The ""twist"" at the end was stupid; plain and simple. Overall, I feel like I had to sit for two hours and watch a train go nowhere and then finally fall off the tracks. It was a complete waste of time. My friends are calling this ""the movie that shall not be spoken of"".",The Village

In trying to analyze the film I find myself wondering about that gravestone in the beginning to the movie. Does any one recall the dates on the tombstone of the boy who died in the very beginning of the film. I just didn't catch it and I can't help but wonder if I had ""caught it"" how would it affected the way I went further into the movie??? Without unwittingly giving any *Spoilers here, the ""dates"" on the gravestone, had I noticed them...........just might have swayed me in an either or direction for the plot of the movie.

The previews gave me chills and I was looking forward to a spooky, weird, chilling story...but it wasn't any of the above! To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The theater was packed that day and as the group walked out, you could hear several conversations about ""what an awful movie that was"". The story line was ""ok"", however I seemed to be waiting the 2 hours for something good to happen. I'm still waiting! It's a shame that so much possible talent was on the screen and they weren't able to produce for the audience. The best surprise was Ron Howard's daughter in the movie. Don't waste your money, instead, wait for the preview on TV. It's much more entertaining.",The Village

At first it just dragged and dragged and I figured I wasn't giving it a chance and then just when it was about to get interesting, you discover what the movie is all about and then you feel stupid that you even sat through everything. I understand that the creator was trying to do a unique movie with a twist but I feel like I was lied to with the previews. The movie had nothing to do with being scary. I can't believe that this creator is the same one that made Signs and The Sixth Sense. I am so upset that I even payed to see it. I think that the previews are misleading. As far as the title...he should have called it ""The Village Idiots"". I will not recommend it to anyone.",The Village

All it was was a different spin on telling what would've been a mediocre story. However, the telling made it a decent story, but it wasn't anything the trailer made it out to be. The plot turns and twists were almost predictable, and the only item in the movie to convey the suspense was the music. I registered on this site in order to tell you to STAY AWAY... a good renter, but not worth my 7 dollars. My girlfriend was also highly disappointed. Whomever marketed this movie was a genius (it led to sales of $ 50 mil on the opening weekend), but he should be sued for false advertising. Signs was way scarier than this movie. If you didn't like Signs, you won't like this. If you did like Signs (like my girlfriend and I did) you still may not like this.",The Village
1309,heilmane,I don't understand all the criticism,9,1 August 2004,"Everyone who criticizes The Village's twists or style clearly has not seen any other M. Night Shyamalan movies, and if you have, did you like those either? Shyamalan has a distinct and unique style that was established in his first three movies, and his newest is not an exception to that style. The point of all of his movies is not in fact the scare tactics, but instead he uses those scare tactics as a vehicle to make a larger comment on different aspects of humanity. Therefore, if you don't appreciate that, fine. If you want to be scared by mindless gore, then that's fine too, but don't go see a Shyamalan movie expecting that and then criticize him for making movies in his own style.I for one found The Village to be scary at times, funny at times, and really thought provoking which is very much the same way I felt about Signs. The music was excellent, and while the first half an hour I found it difficult to really feel attached to the characters, after that I became completely engrossed in the characters particularly those played by Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix. Both Howard and Phoenix did a stupendous job and I think that once again Shyamalan should be congratulated on not only a great story and cinematography, but also for his choice of cast.",The Village
1310,davidbroyles,Same old Shyamalan,8,1 August 2004,"Don't expect terror. It's not very scary. Remember M. Night Shyamalan has a clear style and has still not departed from it. He does not scare you with real obvious terror much, he lets an idea build over time and tries to make you uneasy gradually. He works your mind not your reflexes. The main point is that M. Night likes to create an idea that might be plausible in real life, although a stretch, believable in a movie and that he always uses a twist ending, that especially in this case, was easy to foresee and he tries to make a statement about human nature, which is the theme of this film, the monsters are not really the point, so if you come see this film for that, you will be disappointed. Expect the same statements to be true of future M. Night films. To a thoughtful person, a good, but not great film. Analogy of terror: what Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" was to James Cameron's ""Aliens,"" if you are expecting scary.",The Village

It's not a thriller really, it's a story about love, innocence and courage. Forget you went to this movie hoping it was scary, just open your mind. I think this story is great, for many maybe a sloppy disappointing ending. But it makes sense, it's not some supernatural stuff. I really admire M Night Shyamalan's work, He is amazing. The way he plays with the camera without any special effects and how he builds up the tension. The right music, right actors (!) and the right amount of elements.I really hope to work with him ones, although I'm just a silly teenage girl. :(I love him and his work.

1312,Naru_Kami,The Village; a fairy tale commentary on today's society?,8,1 August 2004,"DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE OR WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS'The Village' was not what I was expecting but I still enjoyed it. The movie was very Grimm fairy tale-esque as opposed to the sci-fi of 'Signs' or the ghost story of 'The Sixth Sense'. But with all Shyamalan's movies I have seen there is always a theme behind the horror, such as losing faith in 'Signs'.All fairy tales are metaphors for something else in society, with the woods being a classic example. A young girl enters the woods and finds a dangerous but temping creature imploring her to pick flowers off the path instead of going straight toward her grandmother's. A brother and sister are cruelly abandoned there when their parents chose to no longer care for them. There they find a candy house that seems to good to be true with, unbeknownst to them, a hungry witch lurking inside.In 'The Village' there is no wolf or witch. The danger of the woods are the villagers themselves. The village leaders are using fear of the fabricated ""Those We Don't Speak Of"" to keep their people under control, away from the outside world and, in their minds, safe. Even without our current political situation this tale's metaphor is timeless. But, as with all fairy tales, it can be interpreted however the viewer chooses. So take what it gives you and run with it.",The Village

I was extremely disappointed and amazed to find out that it won the box office in its premier weekend - I guess everyone else was taken in by the same trailers I was which made the film appear much scarier than it turned out to be. The premise just seemed too unbelievable to make the movie enjoyable. Also, there were things that just were never explained but I won't go into detail so as not to be a spoiler. I loved The Sixth Sense and I even liked Signs but I definitely won't automatically assume other works by M. Night Shyamalan are as good as the previous.

The previews are far scarier than the movie itself, trust me. The one part that may (or may not)jump you slightly in the movie comes near the end of a mind-numbingly boring journey through a fairly good idea gone bad, and it probably won't jump you because it was given away in the preview (when she fell in what you think is a ""monster hole"" and it turns out to be just a bear trap or something).You spend the entire time hoping like hell something scary will happen, even if it has to be a fire alarm in the theater. This is the only movie I have ever dozed off at in my life, and I NEVER do that. Two couples walked out with food in hand half-way through never to return, and the guy behind me at the end upon exiting the theater said to his girlfriend ""That movie sucked bal*s"". She agreed.I won't describe details of the movie because I simply can't survive the boredom again.1/10",The Village
1317,schepdj,On the nature of movie advertisements,2,2 August 2004,"This film was advertised as a horror film. It was not scary, terrifying, creepy, or anything else. It was horrible though. Hmmm... It just seems to me that the way this movie was advertised was not at all in keeping with the content of the film. They shouldn't have made it seem like a scary movie (monsters in the forest) when that's not what it was about. Don't want to spoil the movie for anyone else by giving away the twist. Either way, I think you could call this false advertisement. The movie was billed as being scary, it wasn't scary. It wasn't even a psychological thriller, it was just a movie that was supposed to have a twist.",The Village

I should have known from seeing all of his other movies. The thrill is that your mind always thinks things are worse than they are. It does deliver on the suspense because you don't find out even half of what is really going on until a little way through half the movie. Kind of like (6th Sense). The story again is not what I expected it to be, but very very good. It only proves what a very good story teller he is. When you can have groups of people still talking about your movie for days afterwards, you have done something special. The only people that I know that did not like it are people that were looking for it to be a scare-fest, terror type of movie, and can not recognize a very good storyline.

Anyway, if you liked Signs, Sixth Sense, and/or Unbreakable, you will like this movie. If you did not like those because of subject matters, you might still like this movie because it has a very different setting/plot.As always, Knight's movie is about the people, the decisions they make, and the trials they go through. It's not about having realistic scenarios or anything. They're what-ifs. With that said, the cast is awesome, the writing is fabulous, and the directing is great. Normally, I don't make a comment like that, but the unusual camera angles and deliberate color schemes really add to the film.What I also really appreciated was that there wasn't an overload of suspense that makes you stop breathing after awhile (oh no a guy might come out of the corner - wait never mind - oh but there is another guy coming out of another corner) like you might find in something like Dawn of the Dead.",The Village

The Village has several (what I have grown to call) ""Shyamalans"", or surprise twists. The first is the head-kicker, and while I consider myself a very jaded movie-goer, I was very surprised.But the rest tie the story up very satisfyingly. I'll admit, the final ""Shyamalan"" was obvious to me, but still, it's rare I see a movie that ends so fulfillingly. Well worth the price of admission.",The Village

Bad dialogue, bad acting(otherwise great actors force through a horrible script), bad plot, and most of all not the genre of movie advertised. They take an Oscar winner and make him into the now overused mentally handicapped. Different than those roles, however, the character ""Noah"" seems there to laugh at. Plus MNS doesn't seem to know how the mentally handicapped will act in certain situations. He goes at it with a ""retarded people can do anything and it will be believable"" attitude.If you go to this movie hoping for a creepy edge of your seat thriller, you will be disappointed. Power Rangerish creatures don't keep me spooked that's for sureThe story in all actuality is not a bad idea. I wouldn't even mind the political messages it portrays...cough..terror threat levels. It is just poorly done. You expect all the flaws in this to be from an amateur, not MNS. With a lesser director's name on this it would not have even made it to theaters",The Village

Not to mention the hard-core fans such as myself who saw the 12:01 am showing on July 30th only to be disappointed. Might I add that I was not the only fan who BOOOED at the end of the movie. I understand that Mr. Shyamalan may get a kick for confusing or distorting the story line in order for him to accomplish what he did in 'Sixth Sense', but enough is enough. It seems predictable and unoriginal at this point.Bottom line it was a waste of money. A word of advise from one disappointed fan.",The Village

Deliciously filmed, delectably written, and sumptuously directed, this movie will entertain on many levels and is a feast for the senses . . . yet, it is not too sweet or smarmy. Emerging film students should consider a thesis based on a comparison with Fahrenheit 911. Of special note is Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal of Ivy Walker, easily the best blind performance in a while. Joaquin Phoenix is, as ever, masterful in his portrayal of Lucius Hunt.

You could have walked in an hour into the movie and not missed anything. I thought the idea was great, but they blew it with the movie. I kept checking my watch and couldn't wait to get out of there, not much going on at all, boring. Save your money, not even worth renting or watching it for free for that matter. I did think the creature was really freaky, but when you find out that it's just the humans behind it, you really are scared any more, I did jump a few times, but still not worth it.

First doesn't anyone just go to the movies to watch movies anymore instead of criticizing everything. That being said, I thought that this movie was very well done, from the marketing on down to the cast selection. Howard was amazing, as was Pheonix. Being a Shyamalan movie you know there is going to be a twist ending. Instead of figuring out what the twist is going to be just watch the movie. This movie was great. It wasn't as much as a horror thriller as it was supposed to be as it was commentary on utopian society. It had it's thriller moments. In the likes of Huxley with a Brave New World, Shyamalan wants to say what all anti-utopian society writers say. A utopian society doesn't work no matter where you are. That's whats great about this movie. So what if there were some talky parts, thats in all of his movies too. As for him being in his movies I think it is good, kind of a signature for him.

I really don't care if it looked like it was a remake of whatever, I loved it. I absolutely love horror movies and ,yes, that is what I was expecting. I have to admit there was a split second of let down when it was told that the creatures in the woods were a farce! I couldn't imagine where it would go from there. I loved the twist, and the cameo of M Knight was great! Some could say he stole that from Stephen King, who cares, I love his movies also! The point is, I don't sit and analyze each and every movie that a certain director comes out with, I like it or I don't. It won't stop me from seeing the next one if it looks good! I am just thankful that I did not hear about the ending before hand, that is why I went to see it the second night it came out. Of course, I saw 6th sense a month or two after it came out and had NO clue Bruce Willis was dead! I just go with the flow, I don't try to figure it out before the end.

The Movie has a great cast. Specially by that Bryce Dallas Howard girl! It is a great movie! I truly think it is better than The Sixth Sense!

He pumped up thousands of movie goers for another exciting thrill ride from one of the most talented thriller movie makers today. I spent the whole movie waiting for things to pick up and for the monsters to start playing a larger role in the film. Anyone would be disappointed in this film expecting action. I wish he would have marketed it differently. I just went to it for the second time. Now knowing the kind of movie I was about to see, I was riveted. It's a great story with great acting and visually stunning. Even the twists were more exciting. There were so may clues placed perfectly within the storyline which brought a new light to this film.

It seemed that the author ran out of material in the middle of the movie and was suddenly facing the fact that his movie was lacking the plot. SO he decided to put a lot of fast pictures into a very slow paced film to keep his viewers awake. Well, I was so mad while watching this crap, I couldn't even fall asleep.

It had its fair share of nervous moments and a couple of scenes were really good. I'd also like to point out that Adrian Brody did a marvelous job, so did Howard.Night worked with a plain and simple plot line and used his resources extremely well to make a good movie out of it. I still wonder how the Elders managed to spring so many people in the village in such a short time - possible but would need a LOT of work. Adrian Brody escaping from the chamber to the forest without knowing whether Howard was there or not seemed a little far fetched but, overall the movie was really interesting.",The Village

There are definitely things, things of substance concerning theme, direction, the significance of the movie-going experience, etc., in The Village which are enjoyable (ENJOYABLE, like ""Yes, I have made an investment, I have been challenged and/or entertained, and I have seen a good movie"") but they seem to come from the effort of ""making a case"" to enjoy the film.

1332,Kellyb139,"A wonderful blend of suspense, drama, great screen writing, and emotional acting.",10,5 August 2004,"As many other, I went to see this film thinking it would be a horror like it was promoted. Instead, I discovered this movie to be full of traits almost the contrary. It had an entertaining love story that provoked sensitivity and attachment to the characters. The plot wasn't for those that wish to force-fed one that is simple and uncomplicated without effort on their part.That said, it comes as very satisfying to those that engage themselves in The Village. I noticed as the movie went on that it had strong connections to three different children's novels. It was very similar to ""Running out of time"" by Margaret Peterson Haddix. There were also defiant traces of two books written by Lois Lowery, ""The Giver"" and ""Gathering Blue"". All three stories are highly recommended. I thought this movie was great and I am going to go see it for a second time tomorrow. I also believe many people don't like this movie because they are not digging deep enough into The Village to understand it. However, if you do, you will love this latest work of art by M. Night Shyamalan.",The Village
1333,jandjhammons,I really liked the sound effects and symbolism....the acting was phenomenal.,8,4 August 2004,"Spoiler Bryce Dallas Howard was wonderful, and other actors quite credible. I am like some other viewers, in that I just sit back and go with the plot. (Why ruin it by thinking too deeply ahead of time?) So it was suspenseful and made me jump in my seat when Ivy fell in the woods. I did think it took her WAY to long to get through the woods.....he should have died by then, logically. What a great brave and beautiful girl though!It seemed that the original intent of The Village was noble, but putting terror into the hearts of all the youth and children was ignoble. And why slaughter all the livestock? And which elder was insane enough to do that?I thought the plot was set in the 19th century all the way until Ivy got to the concrete wall. I'd like to hear what M.N.S. envisions for the future of this group of villagers. Will Ivy tell? Her love is already suspicious! Of course, maybe he does NOT survive.My friends and I puzzled about the color symbolism. Is red for blood and passion and fear? Or just to prevent anyone passing the red berried area in the woods, before the barrier. Is yellow indicative of mere disguise, or cowardice? Yellow also can represent jealousy, envy, oldness. The empty rockers are interesting. I can't wait for M.N.S.'s next movie! ...and plan to see the one that I haven't.",The Village

I am assuming she was talking about auras or however you spell it, but what did that have to do with anything and what was his color anyway? Why didn't that go anywhere? I mean don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of Nights work but this movie was a big let down considering the type of work he usually does. I think the documentary was scarier than this movie.

There's one thing though, you have to go in there knowing that its not a scary movie, its a thriller, but not a horror. It's not what the trailer set it up to be but, if you can get past that, the story is very interesting. There are a few problems with the plot that don't really match up but its definitely one you'll think about for a while and probably argue with friends over what really happened, but in the end i think that everyone sees things differently.

I learn my life lessons from Ohhhh I don't know maybe LIFE???? I go to movies to escape REALITY for a few hours I get enough reality form life I don't need it in my movies! I go to be entertained that's it nothing more! And The Village was one GOD AWFUL movie! I was not entertained at all I should have brought my pillow and caught up on some Z's! I just would like to know WHO thought this movie was scary or could be even put into a horror movie category??? I want my money back! I went under the impression I would go see a good hair raising chilling movie and what I got was a big pile of crap! HEY here's an IDEA next time why don't you actually make a movie that follows the premise of what you had in mind! Save the ""TWIST"" for Chubby Checker! This is FALSE ADVERTISING at it's WORST! But a simple lesson to all movie goers like me who wanted a good scary movie......TRULY SCARY MOVIES ARE NEVER RATED PG-13!! PS leave the kiddies at home and make a movie that is worthy of an R rating and SCARE ME! This movie will only haunt my dreams cause I can't believe I paid good money to see it!!",The Village
1337,diode105,What a fantastic story.,10,5 August 2004,It conjures up images that would come about as a result of a spooky open fire session of storytelling. This is only 2nd to the issues being presented & third to his (M. Night's) dramatic use of color and plot building. I love the fact that he doesn't sacrifice storytelling and writing for special effects (especially the OVER USE OF IE Spiderman etc).Its also neat the way he gets himself in the movie. People like Steven King and Hitchcock did this as well and its always a nice touch.Then there is the emphasis on love. Love is an underlying theme here and he pulled at my heartstrings pretty hard.go and see this film. judge for yourself. But I think all can enjoy!,The Village
1338,grfxboy,There's Misdirection-- and then there's Lies,1,5 August 2004,"There are certain facts that cannot be overlooked when critiquing this film. One is that the director is known for surprise endings. His last two films were great to the very end, and had a payoff that wrapped up the whole movie in a nice little package.Another is that the director has set himself up by his previous films as a neo-Hitchcock with his plot twists and turns-- misdirections used as a great magician making a card appear from thin air. There is no doubt that this is what he is trying to accomplish, as he even has cameos in his films in true Hitchcock fashion.But one thing Hitchcock never did was lie to the audience. If you were ever wrapped up in the main character, as is common in good movies, and began to see things through the eyes of the characters, that was your own doing. This film goes beyond that unwritten law of misdirection and sets up scenes and images that are there for no other reason than to support a supposed premise to the point where you must believe. It is no longer the character in the movie who is misled, but you in the audience. There is no slight of hand... just lies.(One such example, without giving the movie away, is an aerial shot of a blind girl standing in a field of berries of ""the bad color."" She is blind and gets nothing from this. It is purely to lie to the audience.)But this is to be expected. The premise of this film is so weak and flimsy, that without a bold-faced lie, you wouldn't sit through the whole movie.",The Village
1339,jeffcomam,disappointing and not as advertised,1,5 August 2004,"M. had said in an Entertainment Weekly interview that this was primarily a love story. He is right. The distributor of this film is guilty for trying to sell it as a creepy thriller. It is very dull, and not scary. For pluses, the twist is cute and Howard and Hurt give great performances. But this film was VERY dull. I said it before with SIGNS. He needs oversight. The lapses in logic, the plot holes, and the bad dialogue need to be fixed and until studios are willing to pressure M. into working with others, we will see more great story ideas being ruined by shoddy storytelling. Lastly, this would have made a great drama had we known the twist going in and watched as the Elders struggled. He doesn't always have to make scary movies. This should never have been made as one and certainly never been marketed as one.",The Village
1340,dknowdntcare8574,SUPERB!!! Surprising but typical M. Night film (thats a good thing),10,5 August 2004,I heard mixed feelings on this movie. My opinion along with many of my friends is that this movie was like no other. The majority of people look on the outside of the movie and judge it on its appearance. With this movie you have to find the moral of the story which is that actions are based upon love. Throughout the entire move love was a factor. I could say nothing but great things about this film all day. The problem with people not liking movies is that they expect things. That is where they go wrong. Obviously people were thinking that this movie would be some sort of horror movie based on the trailer. Movies are suppose to be surprising and entertaining and this one was both and has many more things along with it such as morals. M. Night Shyamalan is a great writer and director. I'd give this movie many awards.,The Village
1341,wpbunnell,The Village is a very poor movie.,1,6 August 2004,"The degradation of M. Night Shyamalan.'M's' first big hit, The Sixth Sense, is brilliance in movie making. It's spellbinding twists and turns, keep our visual senses captivated. Yet, the follow-ups to his focused genre have neither captivated our attention nor brought us back for a second viewing.Unbreakable's premise is interesting. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's performances were outstanding, yet the entire movie was ""muddy"". We had to wade through darkened scenes and murky views to feel a sense of the character's burdens rather than allowing the seasoned actors to show us. So much for the follow-up to The Sixth Sense. It left us yearning for something better.Enter 'Signs'. Again, Shyamalan decided to capture the flavor of the genre by cloaked darkness, smoky light and acute camera angles. Many directors before him were successful with this, yet they maximized the talents of their leading actors. Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix did a great job, for without them the movie would be another dust collector.2004 witnessed 'The Village'. The premise of a village surrounded by mystery and foreboding danger is not a new one. A small cluster of clapboard houses populated by 'turn of the century' folk is the setting for The Village. This film noir takes us slowly through its script development culminating in a less than successful entertaining experience. The moving picture eroded from gasps to laughter in short order.Bryce Dallas Howard is a 'not-at-all believable' blind woman. She moved headlong into open doorways, bolted up stairs, ran across fields without stumbling, all the while portraying someone blind. She did a poor job. Shyamalan allowed this, fueling his directorial demise and cementing this career limiting work.The audience laughed hysterically when Ron Howard's daughter ""formed the cross"" with out-stretched arms. Humor was not the intent of that scene. In fact, the latter half of the film was peppered with audience laughter when Shyamalan did not wish it. Boredom overtook the viewers due to poor directing and poor acting.At one point, a cell phone rang in the theater, a woman answered and proceeded to talk to her caller. No one in the audience berated her, as she was more interesting than the movie.Adrian Brody did a superb job of his portrayal. In the beginning of the film, he allowed us to believe that he was cast as 'filler'. Yet, his character development strengthened, forming the only good performance in The Village.This could have been a great movie if it weren't for bad directing, bad writing and bad acting. We, as an audience, are disappointed with M. Night Shyamalan's film, The Village. We will think twice about seeing his next attempt.",The Village
1342,mikeschuck_7,"Great potential and expectations, but doesn't live up to ""Signs"" or ""The Sixth Sense""",3,8 August 2004,"""The Village"" has a lot to live up to following the release of both signs and the sixth sense. The feeling and suspense however tend to side in favor of a greater psychological, reflective and meaningful mood. The Village is definitely an M. Night film, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to some of his more successful works. The actors seem appropriate and they definitely understand and appreciate the script, the film tends to focus on significant, yet boring and repetitive motifs and therefore some of the actors prowess and potential is lost in the script. The village could have been a bit more scary and suspenseful and it is even a bit hard to understand at times, even if that meant making the film a bit longer. Balance is needed in The Village as it is obtained in both the sixth sense and signs.",The Village

The story itself wasn't that bad, but I was expecting it to be much more scary. The fact that they gave away the plot in the middle of the movie was bad enough, but to let it end that was was ridiculous. I realize that all movies have to end to leave an opening for a possible secret, but come on. The creatures they created were pretty creepy, but I would have been much more scared if I hadn't been told that they were fake before the movie even climaxed. I was expecting much more, and was severely let down.",The Village
1344,jplate,not worth your time,1,19 September 2004,"I was amazed there were actually any positive reviews for this film. It's disappointing in many ways, but the worst of it all was probably the script (apparently written by the director himself). Practically all of the characters except for the blind girl came off as so unrealistic that it was impossible to develop any feelings for them (and the murder scene was just laughable). The film had some good acting though, and the music was beautiful, but not spectacular. As for the ""political message"" of this film, it could have been expressed much more efficiently in ten words or so. But it's certainly not worth a film, and the film is certainly not worth your time.",The Village

If you are looking for a ho-hum, boring, and predictable movie, then this is your movie. One person on another board states that ""The movie truly made me want to be a better person. Shyamalan is showing us things about our nature that we simply don't want to deal with, especially in the current political climate. I encourage all who criticize to take a second look and see the deeper truth that lies beneath this work of art. "" If this movie had that type of effect on that person, they are a seriously disturbed individual.

1346,junc8807,Don't Count Him Out Yet,7,2 July 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan made an interesting move in this game of chess also known as the movie business. A lot of us did not catch but those select few did. Think about it..you make a stunning ghost thriller to make a great first impression, you make a crippling movie like Unbreakable to continue that reputation but you put an unlikely cast within it to make it unique. Signs..he throws his thoughts and ideas about the fate of the planet (many would say an H.G. Wells knock-off), and most recently he sends us the village, a more softer dramatic side of his spectrum. This movie and all other movies are put in a specific sequence that I think will all come together to build the end all of all M. Night Shyamalan films. I enjoyed the villages even though a lot of my friends did not, in some way I could connect with a good part of the plot. Therefore like a lot of his movies I've had to watch it a number of times to get the entire 'spoonfull', that message. In my humble opinion I think that Shyamalan did a great job on this movie and he also did a great job of widening the spectrum of his film career. With this film he is saying ""This rabbit hole goes a lot deeper."" Comments/Questions please, I have a feeling there will be a few.",The Village
1347,mary-carlson-1,I want to live in the Village,9,9 August 2004,"I saw ""The Village"" at a midnight movie on opening night. I'm a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's other films and I was anxious to see this one. I was immediately drawn to the simplicity of life in the village and the loving way that the characters interacted. I was surprised at how drawn I was to the community and their supportive, self-sufficient lifestyle. Their total acceptance and integration of characters who were flawed or handicapped into village life was compelling. The underlying tension of trying to avoid ""the bad color"" and keeping the monsters at bay seemed peripheral to the interaction of the characters and the love story that developed between Joaqim Phoenix and Bryce Howard and the loving tension that was suggested between William Hurt and Sigourney Weaver. However, when the action heated up after the betrothal scene, the crowd in the theater went wild. They laughed uproariously at scenes that shocked and saddened me. I had invested my emotions in the characters, and many of the audience seemed to be oblivious to their pain and heartache. Every time there was a scare or a shock, the audience would laugh or someone would shout out something completely inappropriate to the mood of the moment. I don't go to the theater to watch movies very often. I prefer to watch them at home. I loved this movie and was truly touched and surprised and entertained. However, I came home feeling that I lived in some angry, antagonistic, juvenile society where people don't care about each other and can't empathize. I lay in bed that night, thinking that I would rather live in a loving village where there are monsters lurking just out of sight than in a society where the monsters are sitting next to you in the dark, laughing at pain and deriding some good acting and a worthy piece of work.",The Village
1348,paperfield,Exciting but predictable,5,8 August 2004,"I loved the Sixth Sense, it will always be his best to me. The Village just didn't cut it. The acting wasn't the best. Although I did enjoy Bryce. The plot was predictable, the fate of the village was not. Except that Bryce being blind was convenient. I was able to determine the twist too quickly. In all fairness however, I did get thrown a curve ball with the scene in the woods and the appearance of ""those we don't talk about"". I almost want to say wait for the video, but by then the word will be out and the plot exposed, so it's up to you. It's worth seeing just to try and figure M Night's twist. In Sixth Sense, it hit me like a ton of bricks, but not until the ring hit the floor. In the Village, I was looking for it and found it! Unbreakable was even more challenging.",The Village
1349,saljow1,The price of innocence,10,8 August 2004,"The bad reviews coming about this film really surprise me. I admit I'm not good at trying to figure out so-called 'surprise endings', but neither do I want to. I'm a huge fan of Night's because of the way he directs his movies. I love the sub-text, the symbolism, the deliberate way he tells the story. In all his films the creepy/horror factor is only the vehicle for the deeper story, so I never feel ripped off if the 'aliens look fake' etc.The Village is a love story, and while it's fairly simple in plot, love can also be simple. When you love someone, you'll do whatever it takes to prove it. I personally don't see the whole 'fearful villagers' thing as something to do with 9/11 or how religious sub-cultures are fearful of the world. That hasn't been my experience at all. The biggest thing I got out of this movie was that people make choices, good or bad, out of love--for each other, for innocence, etc. The characters are good people dealing with dark forces rather than people who seem okay on the outside but are really filled with all kinds of evil and psychosis. One character's outburst speech shows why he made the choice he did, and I understood it, whether or not I agreed with it. If you want to see this movie, go in open-minded. It's not a horror or slasher pic, it's a love story with an edge of darkness that must be overcome, and the price we put on innocence.",The Village
1350,emily4U,Needs to be savored,9,12 August 2004,"I must say, after first seeing this movie, I thought it was ""okay"". It was only when I realized that I have been constantly thinking of this movie that it hit me that this movie probably had more of an impact on me than I initially realized. I like it because it is a movie that you can discuss and realize that not everyone ""saw"" the same thing. One person might have picked up on things that another one didn't. I definitely have to watch it again to see all that I may have missed. I found the romance between Ivy & Lucius to be fantastic. Unbelievably, one of the things that I didn't like about the movie was Sigourny Weaver. Every time I saw her I thought ""there's Sigourney Weaver"" and couldn't ""feel"" her as a character.",The Village
1351,nds25,Phoenix rises again in The Village,10,23 August 2004,"First, let me start off by saying that there has never been a movie that I have anticipated more than The Village. Not because M. Night Shyamalan's mother delivered me when I was born, but because I truly believe he is one of the best filmmakers of today. I've read the slew of bad reviews of the movie over the weekend, and I can honestly say that I disagree with the negative reception of this film. I'll be careful not to reveal too much of the film because there are many plot twists. I actually knew what the ending was before the movie ended, but I still enjoyed it because I wasn't anticipating it, nor did I want to be razzled and dazzled in the end, as with The Sixth Sense or even Unbreakable. If you do that with this movie, you will be disappointed.I like Shyamalan's films because he doesn't depend on his ending; it's just an added bonus. One can argue that he depended upon it more this time around, but, all in all, the ending shouldn't be where you get your kicks, so to speak. These twists and turns are not what should be focused on when watching a Shyamalan film. In the end, his movies are all character studies about humanity; they are not some cheap thrill. He is a master at creating layered characters above anything else. Don't get me wrong the thrills are nice, but I really enjoy the spirituality of man that he explores in his work. The Village, Shyamalan's sixth film, is about people who live in a small, close knit utopian community, which resembles the Amish. They are surrounded by a forest that is inhabited by mysterious creatures. A truce exists between the creatures and the villagers that says that neither one shall enter the other's territory. However, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to go into the woods, and he asks the Elders if he can do so. He is turned down, but mysterious creatures enter the village, leaving red marks on the doors.At the end of the day, Shyamalan and the marketing team at Touchstone use this to get asses in the seats (on a side note he is very good at creating stories with a commercial backdrop - not many filmmakers can write intimate stories that offer commercial appeal at the same time), but that's not really what the movie is about. The Village is really a love story that personifies what love truly is, and not just some superficial word people throw around. A love triangle exists in the film, which is very reminiscent of many of Shakespeare's plays.One of the best and most touching scenes in the movie takes place between Lucius and the divine Bryce Dallas Howard's (daughter of director Ron Howard, who gives a tour de force debut performance by the way) character, Ivy, in a conversation where Lucius confesses his love for her. Another of Night's strengths is creating a very subtle and resonant mood and dialogue without seeming pretentious or melodramatic. Ultimately, this movie explores how love gives us courage and makes us do things we are otherwise afraid to do. The cinematography in The Village is mesmerizing. Every shot is so well crafted and executed that I had goose bumps during a scene in which creatures invade the village. I think the reason why Shyamalan films look so good is because he storyboards every single shot. It's almost as if he already has a comic book version of the movie before it is filmed, much like Hitchcock. There is a distinct difference between movies that are storyboarded and ones that aren't. There is a certain resonance and richness that exists with the former. In retrospect this movie is quite haunting because it examines the power of fear and how it can control us, showing that we are never really safe from anything in this world. It can be said that the village is a metaphor for the society and world we live in today, which is hinted at on more than one occasion.A friend of mine even suggested that colors in the film are symbolic of our alert system, which sounds plausible but I'm unsure if that was Night's intention. All in all, M. Night Shyamalan has crafted a great film filled with intelligence, suspense and social insight. To be truly astonished, I recommend going into this movie without any expectations. Disregard the absurdity of the world you are entering, embrace the aura of it, and try to extract the true meaning of the film.If you do this, you will be entertained and moved at the same time.",The Village
1352,ryanw17,"Good, Not Great!",7,10 August 2004,"Overall, 'The Village' was an entertaining flick. The movie did well in creating suspense, all the actors were great and I liked plot. However, if your looking for a movie with another one of those spectacular twist endings, such as the 'Sixth Sense', then you'll most probably be disappointed (much like with every other M.Night movie after 6th Sense). The twist ain't great and its actually pretty predictable but if you go in just expecting to see a good movie, not anticipating some sort of brilliant ending that will leave people breathless as they exit the cinema, I think you'll be pleased. I recommend that people see this movie on DVD tho. There's no need wasting money to see it on a giant screen.",The Village

It has little to no actual horror or action, which one may find typical of an M. Night Shyamalan film. But a least the rest of the movie should be interesting. After hours of hearing people speak in what should be old American English, but somehow doesn't sound authentic, I was about ready to snap. The plot twist was so drawn out and contrived that it wasn't at all entertaining. By the time it came, I cared nothing for the characters. All I could remember is being completely angered when the final twist was announced. I just thought ""This is stupid."" I am usually one to suspend my disbelief but this movie simply went too far. I love horror movies, and I was completely led astray by the previews and commercials. This movie could have been reduced to a 30 minute TV special, but it would still be horrible.",The Village

In reality, it's more of a ""suspense film"". Which, I suspect, could have been why some people were disappointed by the movie.True, the monsters could have been played up a bit more. But, hey! Then it would have been and entirely different script. I would have to say that, in its entirety, this movie is generally perfect. Everything comes together nicely.A little TOO nicely...

1355,whitefire137,Great Movie,8,10 August 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" is characteristic of his other films in that there is always a twist at the end the viewer does not expect.Shyamalan's films tend to appeal to a more artistic group of movie-goers, (especially ones who can use proper grammar and punctuation) as his films are not cut and dry like Spielberg, Lucas or others in those genres. His films are left somewhat untied at the ends to give the viewer the option of drawing their own conclusion and thinking for themselves, instead of letting the writers do it for you.If you are a fan of Shyamalan's other films, you will most definitely like this one. I didn't particularly care for Unbreakable, but the others made an impression on me, and I admire his style.The acting might be somewhat less than perfect, with the exception of Phoenix, who, as always, gives a wonderful performance. However, the setting, supposedly turn of the century rural America, might make up for the simplistic dialogue.Again, any fan of Shyamalan's previous works will enjoy this well-made, intellectually stimulating film.",The Village

Though deeply terrifying at times this is a story-driven film, not a mindless adrenaline rush. Like his films before, M. Night Shyamalan gives us a complex and nuanced story. Hurt and Weaver are established masters at their craft and not surprisingly they deliver fully on the promise of their reputation. Phoenix once again lends a powerful likeability to his pensive hero. It is what Bryce Dallas Howard contributes that is most refreshing, however -- a character unlike any other, unique and not in any way cliché.

If you are looking for a terrifying thriller, this would be a poor fulfillment. However that does not mean that it is not a worthwhile film. On the contrary, going in with an open mind, I was enthralled and I find it is among my recent favorites. The writing is honest, the plot twists and turns are jaw-dropping and the acting is superb. I have heard it described as ""artsy"" and I must agree. The filters and setting give is a distinctly artistic feel and the establishing shots are breathtaking, though awkwardly placed from time to time. Howard is a phenomenal leading lady that we will no doubt see more of. One other point of interest is the amazing score.

Sit back and enjoy the characters and the plot. Forget about trying to figure out the twist, which the director of Sixth Sense is famous for. In many ways, The Village is like the old black and white Twilight Zone stories, only more detailed. If you don't spend your time trying to guess what the director has ""up his sleeve,"" you will be pleasantly surprised at the end. While not quite as good as Sixth Sense, this movie is definitely better than Signs. The acting of Ron Howard's daughter is especially notable. I would therefore definitely recommend this movie, except to those who expect lots of monsters.

1362,chloe-44,Amazing film with amazing acting,10,22 August 2004,"I decided to see this film because I knew it's director from such works as The Sixth Sense and Signs, the latter of course starred Joaquin Phoenix who also stars in this film. 'The Village' is a simple title for a complicated film which has many levels. I shall not give away any details, however I will urge everyone to see this film. I fear that when it is released on video and DVD that it will not do it justice compared to seeing it on 'the big screen'. The Village contains some of todays best actors. Bryce makes her debut in this film as a young blind girl with incredible courage and what a stunning debut it is! She certainly deserves to do well in her acting career and I'm sure she will accomplish many great things in her life. Other great actors in this film include William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Judy Greer and Adrien Brody who portrays a confusing character extremely well. However I found that Joaquin Phoenix was the best actor, not only in this film, but in any film I have yet seen. I was blown away by his quiet but emotionless character that is so hard to play. Never once does his character have a fault and not once does he not convince us of his characters personality. One of the faults I have heard of this film is that it's not 'scary'. I honestly think it is scary in a psychological way rather than the obvious horror portrayed in other films. I came away feeling scared of what people were capable of rather than the 'creatures in the woods'. So I suggest to you to experience this film for the fabulous story which fits together like a jigsaw puzzle, has the best writer, director and producer you could wish for and the best actors I have experienced. If you miss out on this film then you are purely missing out on cinema history.",The Village

Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix did a fantastic job! As well as the other cast, which they did not show as much! Judy Greer, is one of the many! I have seen her in her role of ""Tom Tom"" on ""13 Going On 30"" and thought she was good! And after seeing her play this sort of role, I'd say she is great!!!I recommend this movie to anyone! I look forward to seeing it again in theaters really soon, and also a sequel! Come on, M. Night S! This guy is great by the way. I love how he appears in all of his movies!I give the movie a HUGE 10!!!:)Thank you for reading this review!Kim A. Louisiana",The Village
1364,thefunbrothers,Comments Never Fail To Surprise Me!,8,17 August 2004,"You know what? I love the fickle natures of people. I have read through these comments and the majority are taken up by people saying ""Sixth Sense was good, the rest are progressively getting worse, this film is awful"" HOW AMAZINGLY INTELLIGENT AND ORIGINAL ARE YOU? YOU ARE ALL SHEEP ....... BAAAAWhy is it when a director, a band or an actor come out and do something a bit different everyone flocks round it and worships but these people dare not do it again because the critics will always hammer you down. Its became cool to like a director's first film or a band's first album but then hate all that follows it. You hate hype. I wish you would all just give it a break.OK, The Sixth Sense was an alright film, the ""so-called"" twist was obvious to anyone with an IQ of 40 or above and Bruce Willis was in it! Mr 2 expressions! But hey, it was alright anyway, I enjoyed watching it once.Unbreakable had a role much more suited to Brucey and it had a better cast, a better story and a better twist. BETTER THAN SIXTH SENSE.Signs was brilliant. Totally slated by everyone and their dog but i went to see it not even knowing anything about it, I wasn't even expecting aliens. Possibly on that basis only, I found it thrilling and really scary. I could watch it over and over again, nobody I've introduced this film to has gave me a hard time, they all thought the same.Which brings us to The Village. A superb cast and well acted. A wonderful story which had you thinking twice about everything you saw, it had its faults, I didn't like the way it kept reminding you of early events which may now tie into the story, its not needed, I'm not stupid. Minor flaw though, liked the twists and I love the way this director creates his films, wonderfully atmospheric. Above all this was a great story anyway you look at it. I like a film that makes you go away and think and this film does that. It could have been better but there is no way on earth it deserves the hammering its getting, have a go at a film this year that deserves a hammering like Stepford Wives or Sipderman 2 or Dawn Of The Dead ... complete junk-food movies.So....1. Signs 2. Unbreakable 3. The Village 4. Sixth SenseThis guy has his own style, its distinctive and his story telling in todays world is second to none. If only more were like him maybe our rental stands wouldn't comprise of 75% mind-numbing rubbish.",The Village
1365,straykat58,Why i think people didn't like it!?,8,17 August 2004,"I think the main reason why people are rippin this movie is because the previews on TV made it seem like it was going to be the scary movie of the year and it was actually a good story that had some meaning and people were a little let down... I was ready to walk out on it after about 30mins but then i realized that i was just expecting something different... i thought some of the wording was a little stupid (the thing we don't talk about) and a couple other things left me wondering if a 3rd grader wrote the movie but overall the movie was OK just a little bit of a let down if you are expecting a scary movie... kind of like if they were to make what lies beneath look like a scary movie and you went and watched it, you would be let down... it just has a couple parts that might make you jump if you aren't paying attention but besides that it is a good movie marketed wrong!",The Village
1366,patbubo,Better than Reported,9,19 August 2004,"I've heard all about the ""crappy secret"" in this movie, and after viewing it, I found it to be an unfair representation. I really enjoyed this film. I thought the twist (actually, there were several) was just as good as that in other thrillers -- ""the Others,"" ""The Sixth Sense,"" etc. Think about it... if someone told you a film was about a bunch of birds going crazy and attacking people, would you think it was any good? But ""the Birds"" is a classic. This movie uses lighting, cinematography, and most of all suspense to thrill the viewer. I also thought the romance and performance by Joaquin Phoenix was very endearing. It's a fresh take on a new twist, and it all tied together nicely. Suspend some disbelief, have some fun, jump out of your seat -- it's a likable film!",The Village
1367,om_sivanesan,You will either love or hate this movie; either way you will want to see it again!,10,19 August 2004,"Expecting a movie that will have unexpected twists and turns I decided to see the movie the first weekend itself without getting any second hand impressions. I am lucky that I did that. The grey atmosphere of the The Village adds to the simple life style of The Villagers. The ""Bad Color"" stands out in this background. The chillness in the air touches your bones. Excellent cinematography. The acting was great by the entire cast. Though Sigourney Weaver was wasted. Or maybe she just paled in front of Bryce Howard. The cast took us back in time very convincingly. The innocence of the kids and adults alike was heart warming but at the same time there was always a worry that something bad might happen to them. The want of the youth to expand their horizons but curbed due to the fear of the unknown was well depicted. Great music and sound effects especially when Ivy is chased. Lastly, direction was simply great. Not an iota of what to expect or when to expect. And I came out thinking ""Why didn't think of this before?""",The Village
1368,iwannadalla,Perfect 10!,10,20 August 2004,"This movie, in my opinion was excellent. No one saw the ending coming, some of you are just looking too deep or something but all of your comments tell me you missed something or you were having a bad day! It had so many twists that it kept you guessing and kept you surprised. The slow transitions from the action scenes kept me in suspense and afraid that something was going to happen! I just get so annoyed by this constant roasting on this movie. Apparently, you'll love it or you'll hate it. Really, I suppose this movie could be called an acquired taste. If you aren't real sure, maybe rent it when it comes out on video or see it at a cheap theater or whatever, but I think you should at least give it a try.",The Village
1369,noblechicken,This was your last chance M. Night Shyamalan!,1,21 August 2004,"And you blew it.I have seen all of his major films: 6th Sense, predicted. Unbreakable, enjoyed and was hoping for the rumored ""trilogy"" to come. Signs, whoopty-freaking-do. The Village, Please stop him making any more films.This was his last chance for me, really. Shyamalan is a master of setting, there is no doubt. It is when he just plain uses the ""insert twist you just KNOW is coming"" he falls apart. Let's get this straight with him: He is NOT the master of THE TWIST. He caught a lucky break with the pop culture buzztalk of 6th Sense and that is all. He had master cinematographer Roger Deakins (of Coen Bros. films and perhaps one of the best in the business as far as I'm concerned) working for him, but it's an untapped talent gone to waste in this pretentious wad of ego. He had top acting talents such as Weaver and Hurt, but they are merely skirted to lackluster supporting roles.(I wanted to give Hurt a dang comb the entire time he was on the screen.)The plot as you well know, revolves around a 19th century village (gee, hence the title) that is basically kept there by some monsters lurking in the woods. Neat. Too bad there are too many disappointing answers to the questions raised. The Script, stilted and shallow. The Acting, wooden. The Story, predictable.By the previews I was really hoping for something with some substance. Perhaps a modern interpretation of a pagan myth element come to life in the vein of a Hammer picture? Nope, it was just a Shyamalan-a-thon. A loss of innocence tale done with a generalized heavy hand.When I went, 8 people walked out when the twist was finally revealed. Were they let down or was it that too many people in the audience were cracking jokes and laughing at this mess?I know his work is greatly respected by people. His simplicity of story and attention to atmosphere is perhaps the most ambitious in Hollywood, but the mix never really turns out right. It's like oil and water. And with his popularity on the Hollywood A-list, it seems to me that his film-making will only get more ""M. Night Shyamalan-esque"" and that is just a crying shame. 1 outta 5",The Village
1370,alan-whitfield,Straight into my top 10 films of all time !!!,10,23 August 2004,"I don't want to say too much about the film as I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see it. Go see it for yourself, it may not be a ""Horror Flick"" and perhaps by promoting it in this direction the studio may have created the films only downfall. It is atmospheric, tense, comic and tragic !The film is simply outstanding and it left me stunned............his best film to date !!!Cheers Alan",The Village
1371,Rca626,Masterful Film-making,10,30 September 2004,"I never comment here on films but the amount of bad flack this one has received prompted me to throw in my two cents. Although I'm not articulate enough to do it justice, I will just say this movie is brilliant. Flimsy premise? Yes. Less than one dimensional characters? Maybe. Absurd plot? Definitely--but I can't but help think these were all part of the grand design. It's an amazingly simple yarn about a purposefully simple people. Yeah it requires a sensibility for subtlety and some patience for slow pacing, but that's because of its old school fantastical nature. Sure there a lot of human-style secrets and guises but isn't that what the very best fairy tales are all about? And that's what this is--a really beautifully written fairy tale with some nice bite. The people and critics who saw this film and hated it were simply expecting more of the obvious gore fest, with more horror, something more like the ""Sixth Sense"". In a way, I owe them thanks for spreading such bad press around, I went into the film forcing myself to have an open mind, and was therefore really able to suspend my disbelief in the way Shyamalan intended.I'm just sorry M. Night won't receive any of the critical acclaim he deserves for this genius effort.",The Village
1372,kelsigal-1,Great movie!!!!!,10,25 August 2004,I thought this movie was awesome. I loved all the twists and the main character he was always so silent he barely spoke a word. I also loved the fact that it had all these great actors in it like adrian brody and sigourney weaver that was pretty cool. at first i thought it would be scary. Totally wrong!!! it was kinda like a mystery you had all these questions while watching it like what was in the box? what was in the shack? who were these creatures? where did they come from? That was cool and i loved this movie!!!!!! but i heard it was on the worst movie list which is totally messed up what are these critics problems its like they have no taste in movies. I mean ebert andr roper thought the lord of the rings was bad!!!!!! oh well i thought it was great.,The Village
1373,karen_d_s_,the village,9,29 August 2004,"This is my first comment on IMDb, but I think The Village is worth it! At first I thought that it was going to be a complete disaster, because of the huge commercial campaign around the movie. But after seeing it, I must confess that the movie is really great! Although it isn't a real horror movie, he is at some moments, thanks to the sound and music, really scary. The sound in this movie is brilliant, loud but brilliant, it makes it look and feel so real. Also about the cast, I can say nothing but good. Bryce Dallas Howard who plays the role of the blind Ivy Walker is my favorite actress. She plays here role so good and with so much feeling so that it looks very realistic. And also Phoenix and Brody play there roles with much dedication. I find the other characters a bit flat, we know things about them, but just not enough to really feel with them. About the storyline then, I find it really great, in the end, all pieces match together, but you have to be very attentive from the beginning not to miss any important details. My conclusion is that everyone should have seen this movie at least once. I've seen him two days ago and I can't seem to get it out of my mind. I find M. Night Shyamalan a real creative genius, in these times of reality TV and big crappy blockbusters, he dares to make a movie that is so different from all others , that stands against ""the values"" of the modern film industry , that dares to criticize this society, and in the end is so similar to all of those.",The Village

As there is suspense and a creepy forest during the trailer. But all i saw at my cinema screen was.......... some sad parents who are afraid of losing their loved ones. Damn this movie sucked! I was like Weaver(Ripley) would've been my heroine as usual but she was just a depressed mother. My favorite funny part in the movie had to be the handicap kid getting smacked by the girl : )! also when he falls in the big ditch with that stupid disguise. : )Damn! the director needs to jump into a well and die. Poor movie A total Fart!",The Village
1375,shiftingsands,They don't make 'em like this any more...,10,1 September 2004,"The Village is definitely not a film that I would recommend for those who are merely wanting a good scare or gore fest, and it's unfortunate that the film was marketed in that way. In fact, it really is nothing of the sort. Rather, it's a highly atmospheric two hours in which my occasional boredom during the first half was changed into a--yes, I've gotta say it--spiritual type of awe at what was unfolding before my eyes during the latter half. There can be no doubt that the potent combination of the two Howards, James Newton Howard, whose highly affecting score drove the film's level of emotion to unscaled heights at times, and actress Bryce Dallas Howard, makes for some really profound moments. Dallas Howard's appearance on screen is at once arresting and evocative of something past that is unrecapturable: more than once, I found that, looking at her, my mouth had opened unbeknownst to me, but as I noticed other theatergoers experiencing the same loss of self awareness, I didn't feel so foolish. The Village certainly has some flaws ie, some camera shots near the end make the point of the film too obvious (in a film such as this, the more subtle, the better...). But in the final analysis, I left the theater changed. Highly Recommended...",The Village
1376,sallygibbsuk,Did I see a different film?,9,1 September 2004,"Having read a number of these comments before seeing the film, I was expecting it to be fully rubbish. What I got, and I'm with Silverwhistle on this one, is a modern fairy tale with a thought-provoking twist.The fact that the monster in the woods turns out to be human makes it more frightening. Think about Jeepers Creepers. When the Creeper was revealed to be a demon, rather than a serial killer, the whole film dropped about 50% scary factor. The most chilling films are those that portray something that could happen in real life, even though far-fetched. Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer springs to mind. Monsters are not real - human monsters very much are.This is a mood piece with a proper story, characters you care about and want to know what happens next. I can't believe critics who raved about The Others, which was much slower in pace, and largely a one-joke-pony, hate this film. For stilted dialogue, read period drama, you shallow young things.Yes, there are holes - where do they get their clothes from, do they have a never ending supply of yellow paint, how are they going to replace all the sheep, but forget all that. This is a quality film I will certainly be watching again. And as someone who hated Signs, this is a vast improvement. The Village is a good story with a twist, rather than a good twist with a story attached as an afterthought.",The Village
1377,dkbauer,Absurd snooze fest,3,28 February 2013,"For this movie, M. Night seems to have taken Ingmar Bergman and added a touch of horror, but The Village does not work as a Bergman film or as a horror film. In fact, it does not work as a film, period. The Elders in the Village have decided to isolate themselves from the rest of the world. Although they were all formerly living and working in modern cities (i.e. the year 2000), for some reason they all speak in a stilted, formal manner that must be M. Night's idea of how people spoke 150 years ago. For example, ""What manner of woman was she?"" Nearly all of the actors have problems with this pseudo-dialect, especially William Hurt, and they come off as sounding somewhat idiotic and very artificial. The director makes a point of showing shot after shot of barren trees, leafless and black against the cloudy sky. It must be November at least, yet we have a garden full of bright green cabbages. Our heroine, Ivy, is blind, but in the tradition of all lousy movies, she can ""sense"" things--in Ivy's case, people's ""color"". In order to get medicine for her boyfriend, who has been stabbed, Ivy decides to go through the woods where the ""monsters"" live and make her way to a town. Her father lets her go...he lets his blind daughter travel through the woods and to a town while he stays home. Her escorts, two young men, chicken out, and let her go on alone. But hey, it's okay! Before she leaves, Ivy's father tells her that the monsters are a myth created by the Elders to keep people in the Village. But wait! There is a real monster, whom Ivy manages to kill, clever blind girl that she is. But back in the village, we find out that the monster is actually the Village's village idiot who found a monster costume the Elders cleverly hid under the floorboards of the room they locked him in (brilliant move by the Elders and how convenient for the director). He goes after Ivy dressed as a monster. Blind as she is, she manages to lure him into a pit she encountered before, and he dies in it (why, we don't know).This movie could be seen as a parable, but it would only apply to North Korea. I recently saw another M. Night offering, The Happening, and I cannot decide which one is worse. I wish I had three arms so I could give both movies three thumbs down.",The Village
1378,Kaychsea,"Hitchcockian, but in a good way.",8,3 September 2004,"Most of the criticisms I've seen of the film seem to centre on two points: Nobody is eviscerated on screen and the pacing.Anyone familiar with the director's previous work should not be surprised by the former and the latter is down to personal taste.The film is certainly being punted as a thriller/horror piece, whereas in my view its much more of a Gothic tale. The build up is, for me, well paced and highlights the actual nature of horror. It creeps and grows in the shadows. They fear what they can't see but can hear.The twist is largely irrelevant as its apparent from quite early in the film what the elders are up to. It makes the situation more poignant and certainly stands well as a ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" for our time.",The Village
1379,timbo_83,worth the look,8,4 September 2004,"Perhaps it wasn't the best move for M. Night Shyamalan to follow three suspense with a twist movies with one like The Village, but that shouldn't be held against the merits that this film has to offer. Although parts were slow, this one ended up surprising me more than the previous three. The acting was superb, and as others have mentioned Bryce Dallas Howard has made an outstanding debut. Don't take the negative reviews seriously until you have seen the film yourself.

It is worth it!Mr. James Newton Howard (composer) does an excellent job, the themes has some scary and strange feeling that helps the movie to get closer to your heart!

The story: A tight knit community is in danger of being attacked by the mythical creatures inhabiting the forest just beyond the villages border after a young man breaks the truce by crossing the protected lines. as promising premise as it is this movie fails to elaborate much on that but focuses primarily on a young couple and their love for each other. while thats okay m. night shamaylan (hey I Spelled it right) seems to forget his own story and the creatures r not seen too much but mostly mentioned which failed to deliver some good scares. some scenes were too long and boring, dialogue was tedious and the final payoff was so ambiguous and consequently less the satisfy.Still though the movie is enjoyable at some points and there were some spooky moments. just not enough.""OOOH I'm not so bad once u get 2 know me""",The Village

The cast list and trailers build this film into a great prospect but I was very disappointed with it. I found the trailer more 'edge of the seat' than the film!It starts quite well and pushes all the right buttons for suspense at the start but there's just not enough in the film to keep you enthralled. You can work out the plot and ending quite easily so the element of tension is blown away. The language used in the film is somewhat annoying, especially when you realize what's actually going on.

Don't waste your time or money on this piece of garbage. This could have been a good movie if they had spent some time and money on it, not just film something and throw it out the door, do they actually screen these things before they hit the theater. This not a movie the director should be proud of in fact he should be hiding in a closet somewhere ashamed of himself. My advice is don't waste your money, don't rent it, don't buy it.

The way he uses color to express things e.g. death, good, bad. I also like the way he gets right to the point. The Village starts this way and although you get the idea of the ending not to far down the line I was still really interested to see how he plays it out. The cinematography is really good in this film and I really enjoyed all the tree/nature shots. I got the feeling of the Villagers limitations, their fears, what the woods mean to their everyday life's. Ivy Walker is a great character. Very strong, up lifting. Bryce Dallas Howard has down a really good job, not bad for her first film. I can see how people would not like this film. Unfortunately The Sixth Sense has put M. Knight in a group where people only want the ""Oh my god"" factor and assume that's what they'll get. If you see this film go in with an open mind. It's such a simple message, one I totally agree with. Hope I haven't bored you. Have a great day & keep smiling :0)",The Village
1385,Tbone42,What a waste of quite an interesting idea,6,13 September 2004,"Sorry to say so, but this is - in my opinion - really a waste of an idea. And quite astonishingly so, with the director and writer being M. Night Shyamalan. Maybe his debut with ""The Sixth Sense"" spoiled my expectations. But that debut was just amazingly great, and the follow-ups can't seem to keep up with that initial excitement.Possible spoiler ahead!The idea to the story at first sounds quite promising. Monsters surrounding a probably 19th century village, forcing its population to stay where it is - the village in a clearance in the woods. However, the way it is performed is - quite frankly - a bit boring and silly. Showing one of the monsters (although blurry) really really spoiled an almost breath-taking moment. Mr. Shyamalan is known for that special final surprise at the end of the movie, which no one expects. But this movie is far to obvious. The two ""truths"" to be found are much to easy to detect before they are solved by the director. Knowing about the monsters and having a little bit of Hollywood-type imagination almost inevitably leads to correctly guessing at the final outcome. Trying to imitate Mr. Stephen King by having a guest appearance doesn't help the cause.End of possible spoilerThis could have been much more enjoyable, I think. Too bad it wasn't.",The Village

It was terrible....that's about all I can say. I appreciated the settings, scenery, and some of the acting. Bryce Howard was excellent. I have always appreciated William Hurt's talent but, holy cow, talking with his back to the camera was a bit misdirected. It could have been a masterpiece. I'd be curious to know what went so wrong since I am not in the entertainment industry. Who made up that red porcupine-appearing ""monster?"" Did it ever peek through the trees onto the highway?

How can she run through the yards with no problem, but then she needs her cane to move around her own house? And how is she able to navigate through the woods on her own? Joaquin Phoenix plays the most wooden character to come along since Pinocchio. He disappears from the screen about ¼ of the way through the movie, giving him no chance to redeem the role.Shyamalan's previous films were full of so much suspense, it would make my skin tingle.

The story takes us from a young resident defying the orders of the village head, to the absorbing climax where Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) a blind girl from the village has to cross the woods on her own!Night Shyamalan demonstrates what a fantastic script can do, even without a well-known star-cast. The great direction and some very good performances are overshadowed by the brilliant story line.Ivy Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) gives a good performance while the others are reasonably good. Joaquin Phoenix (Lucius Hunt) didn't quite look a lad in the 20's and is the only miscast.The use of camera angles become more important in a thriller/suspense and the movie does justice to the script. The intelligent use of the camera angles give you the 'jerks' where you pull yourself back in your seat or hold you neighbors hand, though personally I would have liked more of these moments.The background score goes along the script but at no time does it play a 'hero' during the movie. I have felt Shyamalan's earlier movies a little slow (Signs was a big disappointment because of it's pace and too little for the script to offer  offered again a little too late) but this one keeps you intrigued right through.And this is a slight departure from his earlier movies because the twist in this tale not only deceives you to believe something else but also sets you thinking.. (Thinking what? Well, watch the movie)For lovers of stories like the Fight Club, this one would be interesting.The Village is the in the top two's (top for me) from Shyamalan's bouquet of thrillers.Stars - ****",The Village
1389,David_Cox,"If there were a just and loving God, this wouldn't exist",2,24 September 2004,"Have you had one of those moments where you're watching a movie you're just so uninterested with what's going on that you actually question puncturing your eyes out? That pretty much sums up what most audiences may experience when viewing, 'The Village'.errthat is 'M. Night Shymalan's: The Village.' From the self-proclaimed present day Alfred Hitchcock that brought us 'Unbreakable,' 'Signs,' and that only good Haley Joel Osment movie about the kid who sees dead people, 'The Village,' introduces us to a small colony of entirely white actors including Joaquin Phoenix, Adrien Brody, Sigourney Weaver (she's the lady from 'Aliens,' kids!), and newcomer, Bryce Dallas Howard. The 'village people' live their Amish-like lives that, while seemingly innocent and peaceful, a feeling of dread and fear tears at their lives caused by scary monsters lurking in the woods (also known as Brian Magerhurth- the sound recordist). While this all may seem to be a very creepy concept, the story soon falls apart with the most predictable ending ever, which, unlike Shymalan's previous movies, comes dead smack in the middle of the movie, leaving me with nothing (though you'll probably have guessed the ending within five minutes into the film). Also if you've seen his past films, you probably know how Shymalan orgasms over the use of color references. While this may have been a cute tactic in 'The Sixth Sense,' three films laterwe get the point. Move on!On a positive note (and I'm really looking here folks), Bryce Howard, daughter of television and film legend, Ron Howard, gives a worthy performance as 'Ivy,' our blind protagonist who must conquer her fear of the unknown.Strangely, the most annoying part of this entire movie wasn't the slow paced story telling, the lacking in truly scary moments, the script, but the way the movie was ruined by the role of the director, who successfully achieves his attempt at professional suicide. Starting off with placing his name at the top of every movie poster, at the end of every trailer, copying Hitchcock's film techniques (along with everything else), featuring himself in every one of his films as a minor role (why couldn't he have settled for just a walk on role?), and ditching one of the lead characters in the middle of the movie, only to reveal the identity of the real 'star' of the film, (strangely just like the character of Marion Crane in 'Psycho') Shymalan shows his true color in this movie. While he may be able to make pretty pictures in the sense of cinematography, other than that he contributes nothing to his films other than a monstrous ego and techniques entirely copied by Alfred Hitchcock.I was bored to tears seeing this movie. For your sake don't go see this film. Do something more interesting like trimming your nasal hair, writing your congressman/ woman, read the 9/11 commission report, or just beat the crowds that did go to see 'The Village' and go to your local cemetery and go pick out your own grave spot.

I love Sixth Sense and then Unbreakable really appealed to me because of my love of Comic books, and also the lack of good comic book movies. Unbreakable turned that idea on it's head and came up with the movie first. However, I can appreciate that Unbreakable would not necessarily be a commercial hit.Signs, I loved the idea of ad then it just didn't click in the same way that his other two had and once we got to The Village I was a victim of the mediocre reviews and wasn't even anticipating the DVD release. Anyway, I just watched it at the weekend and loved it. Night may be a victim of his own success in as much as people are always going to go in looking for possible twists and anticipating what will happen. Even my wife, who is not a cinephile by any means as I loaded the DVD said, 'oh, this'll have a twist won't it...'Well, I was so taken with the characters I wasn't looking for a twist - I actually felt sorry for William Hurts character as he walks Ivy to the 'Shed that will no longer be used'... I wasn't disappointed in anyway by this film, and I can be a cynical film watcher.I think he's back on form, and even though you may not rate this as his best, even his worst is above par in todays movie climate.",The Village
1392,heavenlyfemale_20,I never ever want to watch this rubbish again!,1,1 January 2005,To say I was bored while watching this film would be the biggest understatement of the century.I was actually considering cutting my arm off and eating it just so that I would have something more interesting to do.I kept watching in the hope that the main character (Ivy) would come to some horrible end because she annoyed me so much.IMDb says somewhere that this film took only 2 months to film and I can well believe that but the amount of money spent on making this tripe was ridiculous.I am never going to subject myself to this rubbish film ever again.,The Village
1393,princesscleo,Excellent,10,24 October 2004,"I realize that M. Night Shyamalan's films don't appeal to everyone. They are unique and edgy in some ways, and have a lot of style. Anything made true to a style will be attractive to only those who find that particular style meaningful, interesting and effective. I, for one, love all of this man's movies. They make me jump in my seat and often make me cry by the end. They always explore a very human experiences and emotions in a way that no one else ever has. Yes, they are sort of like horror films. Yes, they always have a twist. Yes, that twist is sometimes predictable. This is the only problem I had with The Village. I knew before I even saw the movie (and no, no one gave it away, either) what that twist would be, but that did NOT take away from my enjoyment of the film. People who go to see this movie to be scared will come away satisfied, but they won't fully capture the depth and emotion of this story.",The Village

I saw 'Signs', not 'sixth sense', but,this is a great film that can convert anyone to thriller movies. It is the story of a village who live on the outskirts of Covington Woods, a forest that is home to Those We Don't Speak Of. Yet living in fear of what lives inside the forest, the village manages to continue on its life as any town of that period would.But things begin to change when one of their members enters the forest and upsets the creatures that live within, causing them to cross the mutual boundary and enter the village and create chaos. It is a wonderful movie that keeps you in suspense the entire time, and has an amazing twist at the end of the film which will leave you in a state of ...... well, surprised. Only negative comment is that the film ends rather suddenly. An excellent cast line up, fantastic cinematography, and a well thought up original story.",The Village
1395,dog_bites_back,Extremely Underrated (NO SPOILERS),10,16 October 2004,"M. Night Shyamalan definitely did himself a disservice in releasing ""The Sixth Sense"". Brilliant as the film was, its ""twist"" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director. And so, Shyamalan has been trying with every single outing since to recapture that sense of awe.Although many have made scathing remarks about the ending of ""The Village"", it is perhaps his most perfect since ""The Sixth Sense""; though by no means a huge surprise, it nevertheless settles into the ambiance and leaves the film with a tinge of melancholy that belies the trailers.It is a film of startling imagery, with a theme of 9/11-inspired innocence versus corruption that creeps into the mind and stays there until it unfolds over and over again. Many have called the acting ""wooden"", but a second viewing of the film would change that opinion; it is, after all, part of the point. Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter) lights up the screen in an astounding premiere performance as the blind Ivy, Adrien Brody delivers a searing portrayal of longing as the dim-witted Noah and Joaquin Phoenix heightens the moody tone with his strong, silent-type Lucius. ""The Village"" is about these people, this community living in fear, not the monsters of which they have been warned; it is about the psychology of fear rather than a horrific portrayal of it.It must be said that the only thing wrong with ""The Village"" was the promotion for it. The adverts made it seem like a thrill-ride of Gothic horror, like the scariest film yet to be filmed - and audiences were running in their droves to catch yet another Shyamalan Twist. Instead of investing their emotions in the characters, viewers kept their distance in the knowledge that they would be hoodwinked, that the entire thing was a set-up to catch them out anyway. Wrong as this is, it was ultimately the undoing of the movie; had it been promoted as a thoughtful, stark, moody piece of film-making, then both the critics and the public would have been satisfied.This is not a film about The Twist Ending, but about wrapping its beauty around your mind, and the quiet, haunting finale is what helps to keep it there.",The Village
1396,Mr_Fawlty,As has been said... very underrated,8,27 February 2005,"The problem with this movie is not the movie itself. All the marketing portrayed this to be a 'scary' film - even a 'horror' film on a similar level to 'Cabin Fever'. This couldn't be further from the truth. It is a moving film of family life at the turn of the 20th Century and how a community tries hard to maintain it's innocence despite growing problems and the fear of attack from invading creatures.If you go into this movie expecting huge shocks, you will be disappointed, as its pace is very slow. There are shocks to be had - in fact there are some moments that are genuinely frightening - but in whole this movie is about the people, not the 'horror' the acting is top notch - a really good portrayal of 'Victorian' life. There are moments where you actually think you are watching an adaptation of a Jane Austen novel or even an episode of 'Little House on the Prairie'. Don't worry, these moments are fleeting, but they do draw into the time period.As it a Shmayalan film, you have to expect twists, and you may even guess them before they happen, but this does not spoil the movie experience.I highly recommend this movie, just don't expect the wrong type of film.",The Village
1397,moviemaxmovie,Excellent and underrated film,7,5 February 2005,"A very underrated film mostly due to the fact that the previous outings from M Night have all encompassed supernatural, fantasy or alien themes + his trademark twist endings. Its a shame that many people seem to feel cheated that TV doesn't provide this.....exactly !! This film is not really about twists, or trying to be too clever for its own good. In my opinion its a bit more straight forward. Very pleasant music. Fantastic cinematography 'the bland colour tone is great', 'as is some of the camera-work and editing - especially the first time Lucius enters the woods - you'll know the bit I mean when you see it :-)' Solid acting - William Hurt is perfectly cast, as is J Phoenix. Great performance by Bryce Dallas Howard also. Anyway overall I give this a solid 7/10.",The Village

It was a brilliant idea to have to many different trailers because it allowed my friends and i to question the movie and really get us thinking. Well done to Shyamalan for that great work of art.I couldn't wait for the movie as there were so many things one could do with the idea of ""things in the woods"" and the unspoken truce. I have to admit that i had not seen Shyamalan's twist coming and at first it was disappointing, but then he somehow gets you scared again, reminding you that they could still be in the woods.Then BAM it hits you like a ton and a third of bricks! This whole thing could be REAL! This could be happening right now in the WALKER game reserve. What a brilliant idea Elder Walker had - this is why the movie is so great. It is possible.

Most previous posts about the ending are dumb anyway because even if it would have ended that way, it still would have sucked. I don't understand how someone can make such great movies like Signs and Sixth Sense, and then come out with something like this.

There is not one remotely enjoyable person in this film.The plot is so poor, the ending so predictable, the tools to get there so contrived (we'll send the blind girl alone through the forest to find the hidden road, you know, the one no one ever uses that is still magically maintained), it is, as Garrison Keiler said: ""like driving to Fargo at 5mph.

And, this may be a bit of a spoiler, so if you don't want to don't read it, but I'm pretty sure everyone has already seen it anyway, and I don't know about everybody else, but when I go to see a movie advertised as a horror movie, I don't like it when I find out that what little horror there was isn't even real and it's all just some crazy crap. The twist sucked. And while I am on this tangent, signs sucked as well, it showed promise also, until the damn twist at the end, m. night ruins his damn movies with these stupid twists.

1402,nateluvs2draw,Unexpected Results (contains major spoilers),9,13 December 2004,"As the title says, The Village has unexpected results - it's one of those movies where you either hate it or you love it. I personally love it. The movie brings twists and surprises which make your mind wonder about certain realities... it makes you think. If you are looking for a horror movie, this is not your choice. Although the movie contains scary scenes and situations, the ending is not one of a horror movie. The actors bring the movie to life with their amazing performances. At the end of the story, we discover the creatures are not real - they are a means of keeping the community away from worldy things. The village is actually living in a hostile forest, in present time. When it's discovered that the murders and occurrences the elders first talk about in the beginning of the movie are actually everyday things that happen in the world (rape, suicide, murder), we become comfortable realizing creatures had nothing to do with the fatalities - but how can we become comfortable with those things? They aren't right, any way you look at them. In a way, WE are the creatures. We take life at others' expense without a second thought. The movie holds a strong theme - if you get too comfortable with things that are wrong, things that are wrong will become right, and there will be no fine line between right and wrong. This may sound confusing, but it's just my take on the movie.If you get a chance, at least listen the the soundtrack - it holds the same theme as the movie. All in all? 4.5/5 stars.",The Village

Bush, where the fear is irrational and spreading like virus and it isn't important whether the creatures or Muslims or something different and this fear, maybe false, keeps the society whole.And lines ""Lucius,I am back"" confirm the film's attitude towards this kind of society.Very disturbing.",The Village

And what do you know, finally something that didn't leave me completely empty again! Imagine my surprise when I learned it only got 6.5/10 on IMDb (I gave it 10/10). I'm sure you can find some good info on the movie in the previous 1000+ comments, on the movies homepage, ... but after browsing through the comments I think this might not be a good idea. Most reviewers expected a certain 'something' either because of director, cast, trailer, ...

Even though she told me every secret of the movie before we even started watching it, I was still hoping it would be a little bit interesting. Within the first five minutes of the movie I was already picking apart every little fault, because that's just how horrible it was. The actors were ones no one had ever heard of. My theory was that the crew members working the cameras were given a few lines here and there to say in the movie, which was why you would notice the cameras slowly turning away from the actual scene... because no one was holding them. At times I would see crew members with scripts walking around int he background, and I even noticed one of the light guys standing behind a pole. The plot was interesting, up until you found out it was a bunch of old guys dressed in costumes running around yelling to scare kids. And the blind woman (Ivy)? ""I can see colors, but I'm blind. Oh no! I can't see his color daddy!"" Then they killed the only character that was making the movie interesting, being Noah. Oh, and how did Ivy know where that trap was when she made Noah fall into it? Thought she was blind? It truly was the worst movie of 2004.",The Village

The evil outside the village is not a rumor, it is true where the evil is we ourself when we harm one another and kill peace. Very meaningful story with a good symbolization. People who love and want peace would give up almost anything. The movie shows a way where some people decided to live isolated from the dirty world of high ambition. The aim was to protect the next generation from the evil hands of the current world and make them fear it by making a story that evil resides in the woods just outside the village. The story can continue since only a blind girl was able to go out of the woods, so she can never know the real truth behind the story.",The Village

When I saw the movie, there were 4 people with me, 2 of them hated it, 1 said it was so-so, and only one of them loved it. I was not surprised at all by their reaction 'cause those two who hated it love full-action movies (Alien Vs Predator, gone in 60 secs, etc.) and the other is a romantic-comedy lover. Maybe it's got nothing to do with it, but these 3 persons aren't/weren't good students at all. I understand that the movie has lots of details to be considered, but I don't find the plot ""hard to get"", not at all! When I saw it, I didn't even know what I was going for, I hadn't seen the trailer, or red anything about it (didn't even know it was a Shyamalan's movie.. :) ), so I was expecting nothing of it. Maybe if I had seen a trailer, or read that it would be a suspense/horror movie, maybe then I would get disappointed, 'cause the movie isn't nothing of that at all... I see it as a touching love story, with a complex, but valid plot (yes, I have now seen the movie more than 4/5 times, no real mistakes on it), with outstanding acting (specialy from Bryce Howard and quite remarkable performances also from William Hurt, Adrien Brody and Joaquin Phoenix), a movie that, opposing from the other M. Night films, the more you see it, the more you love it. I think that if you see this movie without expecting a ""woah""-twisting-ending, or a suspense/horror thing, you might just like it as well as I did. IMHO, by far, the best picture in 2004!

However, since I am obligated to submit 10 lines, I will attempt to point out specifics. It seemed to me that the movie was trying too hard to make an unworkable project work. Perhaps if a director of the caliber of Ron Howard or Clint Eastwood had undertaken the task, it might have succeeded. I found the portrayals to be strained and unconvincing. It seemed that it was too obvious that the performers were acting - as if they were just sleepwalking through their parts. As far as the writing, actors probably need to believe in a project to offer up an inspired performance. I got the feeling that the actors felt just as I about this vehicle.",The Village

This is rather like saying Picasso used too much blue. The hues and tones of each Shyamalan study are completely different. The Village is a beautiful consideration of the human condition. Shyamalan is a symbolist, and the layers of this film can be peeled back revealing the extent to which our inner demons isolate us, the past of adults and how it can determine the paths taken by their children,and a theme many with children will surely warm to - the horror that can be created when an elder is trying to protect a youth. The environment he creates in The Village is lush,the colours are deep and rich, the characters complex and naive at the same time.

I'm still angry that I spent an hour and a half of my life watching this stupid thing. This director had one hit movie with the sixth sense and used up all his talent with that.

1413,jstanleywsc,Don't Believe The Hype,4,22 January 2005,"If M. Night Shyamalan's cinematic style were a dance, it would have to be The Twist. He loves to give us that unexpected, Rod Serling-style revelation that turns everything on its head and has us replaying the movie in our minds, filing cogent clues and red herrings in the appropriate mental folders. But it may be that after The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable and Signs this popular writer/director has us so conditioned to look for a shocking twist that we go in with heightened, even unrealistic expectations.This film's producer, Scott Rudin, told Entertainment Weekly, the thing he was wrestling with is that the audience is waiting for (the twist). You can ask, could he make The Sixth Sense now? The minute the kid says ""I see dead people"" would you immediately go to 'Bruce Willis is dead?' Every one of these movies raises the bar higher and makes it harder to deliver any kind of sleight of hand. He's right. Which may explain why the theater audience I spent the evening with filed out of The Village looking like kids at an amusement park who had just stood in an hour-long line for a roller coaster that never left the platform. The prevailing reaction was disappointment. Instead of a supercharged adventure, what they got was a soberly paced, feature-length thriller that might have worked better as a half-hour Twilight Zone episode. At least then the payoff would have been proportionate to our investment. Some members of the crowd even seemed ticked. I can understand why. Disney's marketing department set them up to see a certain kind of movie (the tag line reads, ""Run. The Truce Is Ending""). It didn't deliver and they felt conned. But let's face it, in Shyamalan's world, it's all about setting the audience up for the twist, right? If only his final revelation was a whiz-bang wonder worthy of water-cooler conversation. (Most people will see it coming a mile away.) What is worth talking about besides the emergence of Ron Howard's daughter in her first screen role is the film's interesting subtext. The Village works very well as a metaphor infused with socially significant ideas and transcendent themes. Of course, most viewers will be too busy trying to track Shyamalan's cinematic sleight of hand to follow it on that level. That's too bad. Given the chance to be more than mood-altering summer eye candy, The Village contains subtle, intellectual challenges for mature audiences with very little troubling content. That may be small consolation for action-hungry horror fans trying to predict the twist and avoid falling asleep in their popcorn. What does it take for a manipulative director to lose his credibility with a mass audience? It takes a Village.",The Village

I really can't imagine why reviewers gave it low scores, I don't know anyone personally that dislikes the movie at all.The Village centers around a quaint 19th century village in the middle of nowhere. The inhabitants of the village are relatively happy, despite the constant fear of the horrible creatures in the woods surrounding the village.The characters are extremely believable and beautifully crafted. Granted, there is some broken dialogue, and it makes one cringe at one point or another, but it is not common and does not ruin the characterization. Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as usual, as is Bryce Dallas Howard, a new face in the cast of Oscar winning actors.The plot is a typical Shyamalan twist fest with a little romance added for good measure. This does not take away from the atmosphere at all, however, and is done very well. There are a couple parts that are quite chilling, but not SCARY per se. I definitely felt a tingle run down my spine a few times. The ending, if it hasn't already been ruined for you or you don't figure it out half way through the movie, will leave you in shock.Overall, this is an amazing movie, I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone; you will not be disappointed.",The Village

The plot is needing as well as some other things, but the acting and emotions that are used in The Village are profound. They are ones that we can relate to.

I went to see it with my husband and we literally asked for our money back it was so dumb. What a waste of screen and a biproduct of today's public education. For those of you who have not seen this movie I can sum it up for you here: 1700's village just on the edge of a woods. People are terrified of these creatures and the color red which supposedly attracts them. The village elders are the creatures who dress up in these ridiculous costumes they made to continue a hoax on the village for control of peoples minds and actions using fear. When Lucius (character in movie) is stabbed by a lunitic mental in the village named Noah, a blind girl goes to the town on the other side of the woods for help. Turns out these villagers have been living for years in a private wildlife preserve because someone in each of their families died and they can't handle the grief so they isolate themselves from society to live in the 1700's style and use these creatures to symbolize their fear of death and harm, thus controlling the fears and behavior of others. This is the STUPIDEST most unimaginative piece of cinema I have ever seen.

I especially did not like Signs, in which I feel I am not the only one. For some reason, though, I thought this movie was worse than Signs. In the Genre on IMDb this is listed as a Thriller/Suspense/Horror. I did not see one of those in this movie.I feel like Shyamalan is trying too hard to make huge twists at the end of his movies.

There were some really funny moments, as well, which I think makes a story closer to real life. The Village was an absolute joy to watch, from beginning to end, and I look forward to Shyamalan's future creations.",The Village

Even though I had already heard from countless people that the end left them disappointed and the movie wasn't that scary, I watched the film with an open mind.I did not recognize this movie as a ""thriller"" or ""horror"" film. What I saw was much more. The story was superb, the acting was moving and the gift that M. Night Shyamalan gave in his writing and direction had this critic moved to tears. I saw a story honoring Love, goodness and courage. It showed what is important in Life and the sacrifices that must be made in order to keep the Light of Hope burning in this troubled world we call home.Thank you M.

1421,bradleykryan,Sociologically fantastic,10,17 January 2005,"This movie absolutely blew my mind. I grew up in a small village in Central Illinois. My village is on the map solely because of the Amish community which has established itself in the rural area around the town. ""The Village"" is reminiscent of all things strived for by the Amish community. Whilst ridiculed by many and misunderstood by most of the rest, the Amish and the community in ""The Village"" long for the same things: a return to simpler times when the good in life was much more prolific. Although it could be argued that the members of the village have their ideals based upon and rooted in fear, that doesn't differ drastically from many ideals held throughout the world. The negative aspects of our ideals may not be as obvious and spelled-out to us like those of in ""The Village,"" but they remain similar none-the-less. ""The Village"" is a real thinker's movie and I commend M. Night Shyamalan for another remarkable movie. I can't wait to see what's next.",The Village
1422,xcyberx,Another hit..,7,18 January 2005,"This is a subtle thriller turned romance with ingenious aspects carried throughout the film. The location is a village and the era is timeless because time is not relevant. This village is surrounded by a forest which is where those they do not speak of live. The way of life exhibited in the film is innocent and that is exactly what the elders are trying to protect. Although to some it may seem somewhat bizarre, I happen to think M. Night Shyamalan's vision is very admirable. There's an incognito message with this movie that some just do not get. We live in a world which is full of many foolish deaths with incredible pain and this village symbolizes a certain divine purity that should never be forgotten. It's definitely beautiful in ways I wish I could behold more throughly. Not only does M. Night Shyamalan idolize Alfred Hitchcock his style is much like him too. I'd highly recommend this movie along with Shyamalan's other work. 7/10.",The Village

Another Shyamalan movie, but with large werewolf-esk creatures!Wow. Now for me being a fan of werewolf movies i was overjoyed then i saw the movie. i had my doughts, i knew that there was a slim chance for it really being werewolves. I knew that they were probably people dressed as monsters, but i wanted to believe. What a disappointment right. WRONG! The Village is my number 2 movie of all time. Like most people i sat in my seat and waited to be scared to death, but it never happened. Still i was not disappointed i was happy. the movie is not about big scares or overbearing monsters. it's about hope, the same hope i had going into the theater and seeing my favorite movie monster.

Joaquin Phoenix did a great job in Signs and Gladiator. He continues to show what a great actor he is, in The Village. I'm always pleased to see William Hurt. He is a fine actor. The story is a real Night story of course. There is a twist to the story like in Unbreakable and Sixth Sense. You might think this is a horror/thriller movie. But the accurate genre is drama. Yes, the storyline involves creatures living in the forest, and religious like signs painted on doors. But the story is about law and order. We all have laws and rules to guide us in our lives. But who defined these rules and laws, and what happens when we have to break/bend them for the good of 1 person or an entire village.",The Village
1429,specialboytom,a disappointing exercise in oh so tired formulas.,1,26 January 2005,"I really approached this movie optimistically, ""maybe Shyamalan has finally got some class?"" I'd hoped. The trailer looked great,the cast looked hot and the hype was there. For the first half an hour I was happily entertained, It all looked nice, I smiled, I laughed, I jumped in fright, this isn't so bad. Shyamalan really does have polished skills as a director and can create and hold tension like few others. I could (but won't) like so many others, go into great detail trying to rationalise and question the reality of the film. There's no question in my mind i found the premise absurd but I feel that so many people are missing the whole point by petty squabbling about it being unrealistic or predictable (I didn't see it coming too early, then again I do tend to go all passive whilst entertained). No, the problem wasn't with the directing, it is the writing. You see in my opinion there's one blinding error in the writing and when you see it it opens the whole thing up to it's hollow bones. I think it is this,he writes all of his films backwards from the twist. He paints himself into a corner with what he considers a great surprise ending, then goes backwards spending all the time in the film before the twist,simply arguing his way out of the corner. And that is just bad storytelling. Given this knowledge you can then watch the film again and see that almost every line of dialogue leading up to the inevitable twist is simply explaining away any questions about the validity of the twist. About as naturalistic as mj's looks and to be honest I was simply left cold and slightly angry. Gotta give him credit though he's made a career out of films which you can write in 30 seconds and simply fill out to 2 hours. I'd suggest letting someone else do the writing next time. Ha ha I really had you going there didn't I? Actually I'M M Night Shyamalan and this was all a big hoax!!! You fools!!!!! Of course I love this film! Oh will these twists ever get tiresome? I think not! M night forever!",The Village
1430,calico48103,Remarkable blend,10,27 January 2005,"It is hard to top Isaac's review as he sums it up so well. But from a woman's point of view....The psychological part of the thriller is wonderful and teasing and even better the second time when a whole new set of shivers go down your spine.I loved the hints throughout at the background behind the village.Most of all, I loved the romance. It wasn't blatant, but rather small nuances that brought a pause to your breathing. When Lucius grasps Ivy's hand for the first time, the close up of their hands still brings a tear to my eye. It is all you see but a million things go unsaid in that brief moment, even as fear fills you at the same time.Joaquin Phoenix can convey more emotion with a single movement than we have seen in many years in an actor or actress. He grows stronger in each role and I only stand in wonder as to what he will do next. I believe he will become one of the greats of our era.My only regret is not catching this in the theater. I believe the big screen experience would have brought me to screams and tears as this director does each time. As a friend summed it up so well.... ""It is not what you think it is.

1431,EpcotGrl527,The absolute best scary movie ever!!!,9,28 February 2005,"The Village is one of my favorite movies ever, and I'm not a big fan of scary movies. This one I recommend for all people who are at least 9 years old. Any younger and they might be freaked out too much by ""Those We Do Not Speak Of"". I'm 13 and they freaked me out! Anyway, it's scary enough for scary movie fans to like, although it won't necessarily give you nightmares. I'm a fan of all of M. Night Shyalman's movies because of their surprise endings. There isn't much blood if you don't like gore. The only thing I think isn't great about it is, until you get to the end it's a little confusing. But it's all figured out. Bryce Dallas Howard and Joaquin Phoenix work awesomely together, even though I would never vote for them as cutest couple.",The Village
1432,chezr,"A brilliant film, you really have to get the meaning behind it, to appreciate it",9,30 January 2005,"Firstly I would like to say I really enjoyed this film. I did not see it as a thriller or horror, like the trailer suggests and many expected, however I saw it as a beautifully crafted piece of work. It is all about fear mongering (which is around a lot in the governments of America and Britain these days, even though they are half responsible for the stuff we are fearing!) and how the unknown and unexplainable is a lot more terrifying than something that is known. We are afraid of being afraid, when something is happening we are no longer afraid. Luscious has the courage to venture, and a blind woman in love has the courage to venture through a forest for him. I think that is an amazing thing for her to do!! The real evil, are the elders, trying to control their fears by controlling others. The catalyst for their wrongings is Noah, as he (mentally challenged, simple) can not be controlled under the environment they have enforced on everyone.The bleakness of the film highlights the bleakness of the world they are living in, and the red costume stands out as they do not see it everyday. I believe it represents blood and fear within the villagers. Luscious colour is perhaps red (as Ivy goes on about) suggesting his stabbing later on, and also how is not afraid of the colour red and the monsters. As Ivy says to him: No one can beat your time (referring to them standing with their back to the forest to see how long they can stay without getting scared). The bleakness makes a strong point, like in Shindler's List where it is black and white apart from the girl's red dress.So overall i do appreciate this film, I can understand why others may see it's faults, however you have to take it as not a horror or thriller, and do not try to work out the twist at the end, you will only be disappointed. It still made me jump and feel tense as i saw the vulnerability of all the villagers. I believe this is a social message and we should take something from it. Is it better to live without technology and financial worries, but live in fear and have lack of freedom? Are we always being controlled however hard we try to stop it? Oh one last thing..... Did the guard's company name being Walker, have reference to the fact that they were protecting the boundaries for Papa Walker??",The Village

Unfortunately, this movie didn't keep me at the edge of my seat - it made me want to fall asleep from its, frankly, dull story. If, perhaps, I myself was afraid of the color yellow, it might have made for a scarier story... but as it is, I am, sadly, not.Whomever equated this movie with Silence of the Lambs should be left in the woods wearing red and hoping that there really are large beasts wearing red cloaks who live in the woods and prey on those who enter their home.The up-sides are: 1. The movie only runs 108 minutes, so I was only an hour and forty-eight minutes older by the time the credits rolled; 2. I rented the movie rather than wasting the $8 to see it in the theater; and 3.

One thinks of early episodes of Dr. Who. Even a child would not be fooled into believing that the ""creatures"" were not humans in costume.In order to accept some of the plot elements, one would have to more than suspend disbelief. One would have to discard all logic. Consider Ivy's on-again/off-again blindness, discussed in detail elsewhere.The film could have developed the moral dilemma arising when Joaquin Phoenix/Lucius is stabbed. The villagers had sworn an oath not to return to the outside world but not to return would mean that Lucius would surely die. While one does not expect treatment of this dilemma to rise to the level of Hamlet's internal conflict, this could easily have been a key part of the plot.

I believe that is why I didn't like this picture. Had I expected another type of movie it would have been better. In all actuality, the movie was good. It had good acting. Bryce Dallas Howard did a wonderful job as the lead! This movie did boast some big names, like William Hurt and Sigorney Weaver. I also liked the costumes. I liked the beginning of the plot. It was kinda suspenseful. And it did have a major plot twist to it. I did find the twist a little ridiculous. But if the filmmakers set up a movie a certain way, they should deliver.

1438,mdawg6448,A great love story,10,1 March 2005,"It seems like every comment I've read on the masterpiece was about how well the twist worked or how scary it was. I don't think that's what the movie was about at all. Yes, these elements certainly added to the story, but the center of the film was not philosophy or a cheap thrill, but love. True love, for that matter. It's about two people that are meant to be together, who love each other for all the right reasons. Then, when that love is threatened, the story shows you what true love is made of. It shows sacrifice in the face of fears, both real and imagined. When all else falls away, only love remains. Perhaps M. Night Shyamalan's own words state my case best when his character, Edward Walker, tells his fellow townsmen, ""The world moves for love. It kneels before it in awe."" In conclusion, I loved the acting provided by a stellar cast, the incredible dialog style that only Shyamalan can write, the wonderful music, and the depth of the philosophy and symbolism. However, what left me breathless at the end was a deeply moving love story central to the plot.

You folks can't see the connections?!I completely agree with Shyamalan, but he is going too easy on the religious folk. He's likely after the big bucks and doesn't want to bite the hand that feeds him. I am intolerant of religious beliefs, as I am with most nonsense and childish thinking. Religion doesn't or shouldn't automatically get a pass that we would never provide other sets of beliefs (e.g., fascism, Sharia law, chiropractic, osteopathy, Santa Claus, and the Tooth fairy).

1442,keenekatie,"""The Village:"" Dystopia or Utopia?",7,6 February 2005,"I began watching ""The Village"" with reservations. I thought it would be a basic thriller. After viewing, I was pleased to find the questions it summoned...essentially, is the depiction of the Village a Dystopian or a Utopian society? Interesting elements are contained in the film that lead to an answer. First, what is the motive behind the attack of Noah Percey (the mentally challenged character) on Ivy Walker (the blind girl) in the woods? Was Noah's motive (a) to help Ivy navigate the woods, with his eyesight and experience? (b) to find his playmate and continue to play the games in which they often engaged? (c) or had his madness/jealousy escalated to the point that he was seeking her out to kill her, as he had attempted to kill Luscious, her fiancé? Furthermore, what was the purpose in his adorning the costume, was it (a) to escape the village people, as they were holding his captive for his attempted murder? (b) merely a costume for a game? (c) did he become a true creature of the woods? It is my opinion that the jealousy Noah experienced in hearing the news of Ivy and Luscious's engagement heightened his madness, causing him, first to attempt to kill Luscious, and then to similarly go after Ivy, with the intent also to murder her. Evethough the creatures in the woods were a fictional creation established by the elders to contain their society in the boundaries of the village, a real creature of the woods was created by Noah. Thus, their fictional creation morphed into a reality proving that the village, in fact, is a dystopia. The experiment made by the history professor was unsuccessful in that the society found they still can not escape the tragedy that befalls human beings. Jealousy, madness, and murder are not created by modern society but rather are inherent to the psyche of human beings. These human traits can not be stopped by isolation.Interested to hear other perspectives.",The Village

It is an extremely good movie, well made, beautifully shot and extremely scary and creepy when you watch it for the first time. You just don't know what's wrong in the woods or better behind the woods. The village seems a very pleasant and peaceful place to live in. It is hard telling what the story is about without revealing the plot. What I like most in this film, is that it is a rather slow movie, long shots, well acted, good conversation. The best conversation takes place when Ivy and Lucius sit on the porch and she asks why he doesn't speak of what's going on in his head. His reply is great. So are the costumes. The costume of Those We don't Speak Of is marvelous. The ""bad color"" is well chosen. You should watch the film twice: once to get the whole story and be shaken in your boots and the second time to watch the acting, the settings and the way the movie is shot.

Example, who the other elder was that was a ""those We Don't Speak Of"" and it didn't say if Lucius Hunt got better and if he got married to Ivy Walker.

From the performances to the haunting score everything was working for me.I can see why some people might struggle with The Village because the pacing is something you either embrace or fight against. If you're looking for big orange explosions et al you're going to be disappointed. The key is here is menace. The creeping kind. And this is a milieu that M.Knight Shymalan is rapidly making his own.I liked the antiquated dialogue. It added to the Salem-like atmosphere and it ratcheted up the atmosphere of a community haunted by what might be lurking in the dark. In fact just enjoy the film for the acting alone. It's a great ensemble cast with more than few ""stars"" content to shine in supporting roles. And shine they do. Breendan Gleeson take a bow. I always got the sense in his performance that this was a man that had more to say (check the DVD). But then that's the beauty of a tormented character and a great bit of acting.In Shyamalan's films, he spends a lot of time on his characters. You really get to find out what makes them tick. Rarely is anything taken for granted. And whilst this may, in some people's eyes, slow the plot down it really makes you care about what's happening.The score's a cracker and the atmospheric sound effects are from the top drawer. It's really great to watch a film that is haunting from the word go. This is a definite slow-burn experience and all the better for it.Menace and caring. A satisfying combination.",The Village

Bryce Howard as Ivy is a definite role model for young women to see. I think that the positive message of her strength of character outweighs the concerns about scary parts of the movie for teenage (actually preteen) girls. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. The cast of more experienced actors was excellent. William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Brendan Gleeson, Celia Weston, Cherry Jones all played their parts with a believability and dignity that made the film shine.

It was a thriller of the even, slow-paced, old-fashioned kind. It was a romance. But, beyond that, I found not-so-hidden messages about society and religion.Is the ""evil"" that they tried to escape from inherent in all of us - i.e., physical and mental illness - and impossible to escape from? Is the ritual and symbolism imposed by the elders a metaphor for established religion? The creatures metaphors for the devil? Does the youngster taunting the creature strike a decidedly Calvary-esque pose? Seems like there is more behind the movie than even the write-director speaks about.",The Village
1451,jdickson55,The Village- a Utopian Society,8,21 February 2005,"I have seen all of Night's films, and agree with another commenter that the endings tend to be weak.....especially Signs, and The Village...not so much with the Sixth Sense. He has an interesting approach to the supernatural, which is great, but why do they fall apart at the end....? The Village is a great film about a Utopian Society, and in watching the ""making of"" and the deleted scenes, I understood it a lot more....unfortunately, the deletion of the pipes in the woods, which made the eerie sounds of the ""monsters"", would have helped the audience understand the farce. I was angry that the park ranger who stole medical supplies for Ivy was not seen assisting her back to the woods, we did not see her return to the Village which is when they could have shown the pipes. I did not see this as a true horror film, since the monsters were farce, it was an interesting portrayal of a group denouncing modern society and its violence, returning to a simpler life.....however, not sure they needed to avoid medicine? Also, when Ivy returned, why the film ended abruptly there, I don't agree with....no transition, the healing of Lucius, nothing....it's like I was mesmerized by the whole film, and then said, ""that's it?"" at the end???????? bad. So I loved the film, but not the ending. Much like Signs...when I saw the alien it was all over. The mystery was better than knowing. The Sixth sense made more SENSE, and was good. Unbreakable was disappointing at the end as well.... come on Night....let's put more effort into your endings, please.....!!!",The Village
1452,ATCMichael,We Love His Formula...,9,23 February 2005,"M. Night Shyamalan has done it again. A perfect cast, a compelling story. Love will conquer all.Who hasn't wished that they could return to a simpler time, possibly a safer time? The 19th century rural utopia would be a tonic for many today who are feeling simply swept forward into a world that they have little or no control of.The growth the ""Elders"" is nicely portrayed without the total destruction of their Eden as most other story tellers would have treated this subject. Lies, even for the noblest purposes, do have a way of coming home to roost with undesirable results.This movie is not for everyone. Those who must have an adrenaline fix every few minutes will and should be disappointed. This is not a story about monsters; it is a story about those who live successfully in an isolationist's utopia.This story is told as one would view an earlier time, unhurried, at it's own pace. The collision of the two realities at the end of the movie was done with great restraint and composure.Of course the staff that guarded the preserve would be hand-picked for their pathos or innocence. Why else would there be fully stocked medical facilities every 10 miles along the perimeter of the preserve? Can you imagine being the Trust Executor protecting this Eden from publicity? For those who didn't catch it the first time, Mr. Shyamalan played the guard captain reading the newspaper. His reflection is clear in the Medicine Storage Case glass.This is a thoughtful and well told tale, one that makes for much conversation after the viewing.",The Village

His movies are slowing degrading in his story lines. I think he is running out of 'material'.The behind the scenes, DVD, show all that was involved in making ""The Village"". I was particularly interested in how much work and training the Joquen Pheonix did to prepare for his role. I think his total amount of dialoge was about 2 minutes for the whole movie.At the last check, the movie has grossed well under the approximate budget.I will certainly think twice before I spent any more money on his movies.",The Village

I thought this was a scary movie, so I rented via pay-per-view for 4.99, and am highly upset. I agree with the people who said that the advertising was misleading. I thought his first film, forgot the title, you know the one...""I see dead people"" was much better. There were parts of the movie that I didn't get, but maybe that was because my daughter wouldn't be quiet so I could hear. The ads made it seem as if the movie would be scary, while it was suspenseful at times, it wasn't scary, and well I am very disappointed. I mean, I sat through most of the movie thinking, what in the world? I mean all of the suspense only to be let down at the end.",The Village

This is a good admonition that you have to see movies more than once! This is a very finely tuned movie! The ending section with the guard is particularly well done. It's a fable, not so much a horror movie--in this sense it reminded me of the Wizard of Oz or The Night of the Hunter. It's a romantic fable-very romantic with the beautiful blind girl and everything --""who sees the world as others don't"" an allegorical fable--does she represent the quintessense of innocence-- the village was founded by people looking for innocence. Hard heads who want to be wowed by surprise twist endings aren't going to care for it nor those who dislike romantic fables.

It is very nicely done, features some great performances, and it has a very profound atmosphere that kept me plugged-in right to the ending credits.Because I believe that it's best not to give away too much about it, I will only say a few words about it: It is not a slasher horror movie, or a small budget, under-achieving and pretentious mess, like I have believed for years. The story is very deep and it draws the watcher into understanding the situations and care for the characters.The relatively low IMDb rating is probably due to the fact that the film promotion misses its target audience, on one hand and draws fans of other genres, that fall short on their expectations, on another.If you are looking for intelligent, beautifully looking movies, you cannot miss this one.",The Village

The dialog was terrible, the costumes were mediocre, and any actual surprises were few and far between. Anyone who has picked up a work of science fiction from any point in the last 100 years will know nearly every turn of the trite plot line from the time they meet the main characters and be hoping against hope for it to turn some other way, only to be disappointed entirely. There are only a few details that I hadn't pinned down precisely after fifteen minutes, and even those I had narrowed down to just a few possibilities.

There are moments but not enough to satisfy those who expected some real frightening movie.But the director has done it again. The plot is consistent and witty. Everything works together and makes logical sense at the end, sadly not the case for all movies that are coming out recently. A very nice cast, this is the movie to satisfy an audience that likes a nice change from the normal redundant story lines and typical endings.But be warned, if you come to watch this with the sixth sense expectation, then stop right there. Since you already experience a twist and expect a twist, you're not going to be as impressed with it. Sort of like how most responded to other works of M. Knigt. Be open minded. This movie really is a pretty good one if you don't always tack on all of his other works especially the first one. Sit back and just enjoy another M. Knight movie.Last, I like to add the nice focus of colors in the movie to differentiate the between the two sides. The color soon becomes a very strong instrument to pull on our sense of alertness.

Many of the people who went to see it with me thought it was terrible because they went to get scared and were disappointed. It was a psychological thriller just like the rest of M. Night Shyamalan's movies. Only the trailer to this one portrayed the movie as scarier than his other movies and so compelled more people to see it to get scared instead of what the movie was actually about. I enjoyed it because of the information that you find out close to or at the end of the movie. Once the whole story comes together it is a psychological thriller, and not many people were expecting that and thought it was dumb. I didn't and I enjoyed it. If you went to see the movie to get scared then you were sorely disappointed.",The Village

Although there are suspense/thriller qualities, the story is also has some drama and charm.I watched the movie on an average DVD player and basic 29"" color TV, on which, the movie format was well presented. So I am sure if you have surround sound and a better TV, the experience will be good, too. The cinematography and imagery were well presented, especially the use of colors and lighting. The sound was good, but it's volume fluctuated with the needs of the scenes, so make sure the kids are quiet and the dishwasher is turned off, or have the controller handy. The acting effectively presented the story in the way the director wanted us to perceive the story as it developed ...

Yes, there is an almost surreal element to this film, but it enhances, rather than detracts from it. There is an honesty here, that is refreshing and moving... and an overall message that we have given up too much of our security, human dignity, and innocence in our ever-increasing desire for more so-called sophistication. The acting is superb, with excellent performances by William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, & Bryce Dallas Howard, and a stellar job by Adrian Brody.The Village is a movie that stays with you, and makes you ask the question 'what if?'.

I have heard much disappointment from many but also praise from many others as well. This movie is based on your taste and this film was created to be a 'romance.' A lot of younger viewers went to see this movie expecting thrills, gore, raging beasts, something much like 'The Grudge' perhaps? Mainly because this movie was advertised that way which I did not like, it's a great marketing tool but if you want people to enjoy the movie for itself advertise what it is. This movie is all based on opinion and in mine I believe this movie was wonderful. The music added the missing suspense and added more feeling for the characters. As for the characters they were done wonderfully. The costumes were wonderful as well; Ann Roth is defiantly a artist. I watched DVD features and she would make sure everyone's costume was 'perfect' before shooting.The dialog might be hard for younger viewers to understand which could be another reason why people did not like it. I loved the dialog, the theme, everything about this movie! To fully enjoy this movie age does not matter, it's all in your taste. If you enjoy a little bit of humor, mystery, some suspense, romance, and beautiful scores of music, then this move is defiantly for you.

All over Europe, this movie was well accepted by the critics and the public in general. But in the United States this movie was rejected by all! Why? Because this movie demonstrates the state of America. They (American, most of them) just live for their country, they only breed for they country, they only know about their country!! By the way, Portugal is a little country near Spain, it's a European country and it's not Spain!!! They live in a complete isolated state of utopia,happy with themselves, not knowing that they are a part of the world and not the all world! This film, it's a portrait of this kind of thinking. That Village it's America, and outside the village it's the unknown, the danger, the enemy. But when one of Americans (the blind, can't you see the metaphor?) goes outside and meets the unknown she understand finally the truth: they are not alone, there are friendly people, yes people with feelings, beliefs that are ready to fight for a better world together. So, why we European understand the meaning of this movie? Because it's a hell more easier to see the other then to see ourselves in the mirror! Please see this movie without expecting that switch at the end, this film deserves more than that. Appreciate the symbolism, the music, the dialogs (that one with luscious and the blind girl it's one of the best love dialogs ever), everything on this movie!

If you're looking to see a horror flick-you'll be sorely disappointed. Whoever marketed this movie has absolutely no idea what they're doing. Fans of Shyamalan's twister-shock endings won't get the Sixth Sense package. Instead, look forward to a few scary moments, heart-touching dialogue, and a really good story of innocence lost and hope to be found. I don't want to give anything away, but you just have to see it to appreciate that this isn't one of Shyamalan's horror sticker shot movies.

In the story I read, a boy and girl go playing one day and the girl gets her foot stuck between some rocks. She makes the boy vow not to tell anyone... takes off her shoe, and she has 6 toes. He promises and takes her home. She makes him vow never to tell anyone because anyone in the village that has a deformity is put to death as being an abomination against god. To make a long story short, it ends up that outside the borders of the village is a modern civilization that was destroyed by nuclear war and the people who are put to death inside the village are killed so that radiation related birth defects won't spread to the 'protected' villagers.The stories are so identical in tone and meaning.. the village, the people, the father, the boy and girl, the border, the modern civilization outside the village... there's no way that m. night didn't plaguerize this book or use it to get his ideas from.It's a good movie, but it's a ripoff.",The Village

I have seen better before, but it was OK. I don't know why they didn't call these creatures/ old fogeys in the woods by their real names. I wonder why they called them: ""Those who must not be named"" or something similar to that. Why did they choose red as the bad colour? Why not black or blue etc?

I think is underrated as a piece overshadowed by the director's other works,but it should not be. As a stand alone work, it is in my opinion a masterpiece and should be enjoyed as such. Like a lot of SHYAMALAN's films the story has a twist in the tail,because from the outset you believe the setting is back in a previous time,and not until the last quarter do you see that it is in fact set in modern times.The people chose to go and live where they are and how because of previous events that are kept from you until near the end.",The Village

Night Shyamalan's work. 'The Village' is quite imaginative and its analogy between its story and nowadays society is impressive and touching.The original score (a thing to praise) is amazing, as in certain moments is calm, in others is stressful (in a good way): perfect ambient.I don't understand why people hate this movie, I think it is because of M.

I grabbed this off the shelf of the Video Rental Store because they were out of everything else that I wanted to see..... After the first half hour of this movie, I wasn't sure whether I should laugh or cry. (I wound up laughing). If I were to take this movie seriously - which I didn't - it would be right near the top of my list of ""WORST MOVIES"" I've ever seen. It would have been an excellent movie had it only consisted of music and photography. Unfortunately...there was dialog. Joachin Phoenix - who I like (and who was actually better than Russell Crowe in ""The Gladiator""), was wasted in this movie. On the other hand, Adrien Brody was perfect!! The fewer lines he delivers - the better! His Academy Award for Best Actor in ""The Pianist"" had to be the absolute worst Best Actor award ever given. (It should have been the ""Best Mumbling Award""). He does a fine job of mumbling in this film as well. As for the story, a lot of other online reviewers seem to have found it ""profound"". Oh-oh....I think I'm going to start laughing again. I don't know how I did it, but I managed to sit through the entire movie. My wife had enough after the first fifteen minutes and would have preferred to watch ""CSI"" re-runs instead. My only possible take on this movie is that Shyamalan is ""goofing"" on everyone - and for this I have to give him a lot of credit. Actually getting a studio to make and promote this movie was an outstanding achievement. 99.99% of Directors couldn't make a movie this bad if they tried.....If you're having trouble sleeping and/or would like to have a good laugh, I can highly recommend this movie!!",The Village

1472,kazkopac,what a great storyteller,10,1 May 2005,"The Village, I found to be a truly beautiful film in every sense. In my point of view it is essentially a love story first, and the circumstances of the town and what was happening there came secondary. The script was beautifully written, and I believed every word, one of my favourite scenes being the dialogue spoken between Luicuis and Ivy on her porch as he was watching over her . The performances were incredible, in particularly Bryce Howard, what a great first time performance for her. I have always been a great fan of Joaquin Phonenix since ""Parenthood"" and he did not disappoint. In regards to the costumes I was glad to see that the creatures from the dark side were made using the traditional techniques (costumes and make-up) as I feel they give the story an amazing timeless quality. The production design was spectacular with the whole town being built from scratch based in such a remote location. Well done to all of those in the art department, the set dressing was amazing, and I am sure there were many a leaf wrangling. I believe the score is so in sync with the film allowing it to flow so beautifully, and as the viewer I was totally caught up with the what I was seeing, keeping us in suspense and intrigue and in love without being to obvious. The only other film that I have felt has come close is The Piano. The cinematography and lighting allowed us to be caught up in the small town, to run into our homes when it called for it, to follow the love story, and to feel anguish when she was in the woods, only a great cinematographer can give you such a front-row seat. Overall I found this film to be I timeless story that is obviously based in history and tradition which translated so well onto the big screen, in my opinion only due to the fact that M.Night Shymalan, the king of suspense, met the challenge.",The Village
1473,tossi2,"What an excellent movie..........If i was blind, deaf and dumb",1,5 May 2005,"M Night Shamalayan or however you spell it is supposedly this God of a director according to most movie reviews i have read on the net. Well, i went to see The Village when it first came out based on this statement and i can't begin to put in words how bored i was! At one stage of the movie my friends and i bet on who could throw a Kool Mint at the guy making out with his girlfriend in the row below us. I would've walked out of the movie if it wasn't for the fact that i was having to much fun laughing with disbelief at how bad the movie was. The first 20 minutes of the movie i will admit was quite excellent. It looked very promising indeed and i was actually relatively interested on what was going to unfold. M Night Shama-whatever his name is, did an excellent job building up the interest and suspense over the first 20 minutes so the audience was intrigued. Then for some strange reason, he decides to destroy the whole basis of the movie and went against every single marketing ploy The Village received. Disappointed is not the word; rather, when the town elder tells his daughter (who is forced to travel through the village to get medical supplies) that the whole pretense of beasts in the village is in fact phony and made up i think my first reaction was laughter at the fact that the director and whoever wrote the play destroyed the basis of their story.From this point on, whatever events unfold in the story are really just a joke and the audience has already lost its interest. Really, it is apparent from much earlier on that the whole pretense of the movie is a hoax. If the fact that the movie reveals that its story is a hoax isn't enough, it then goes on to try and re-invent the story by having the token retard of the village dress up as the beast to scare the girl without anyone knowing. And the girl, conveniently blind, somehow manages to dodge the retard (focus on the fact that he is a retard, not that in reality she is blind and would have no chance)in what is a slow motion jump out the way of the retard who conveniently falls into a gaping whole (i had to laugh at this point) right behind the girl and dies.The reason i decided to spoil the entire movie for you is so you don't go see it with expectations of a good movie, but rather expectations of seeing a movie that was intended to be taken seriously, but turns out to be a complete joke. Whatever your view, if you did enjoy this movie, i urge you to get a life because i would rather sit through a token black comedy like ""Guess Who"" or even a Hillary Duff movie (God help me).Final Verdict: The Village is crap and i hope the idea of what M Night Shamalyan classes as a thriller, suspense type movie doesn't catch on or else we'll all be bored shitless at the movies.",The Village

They are passionate without haste; much is to be said about control as well. I found the movie slow but interesting enough to tell the story and watch with eyes open and wide for the next twist. This is not Alien, so if your looking for action there is little, if your looking for good honest acting and plot that would tell a story that would be hard to bring to the screen without the talent involved, this would be a personal hit for you.Ron Howard's daughter debut is wonderful; she brings you into the story without notice, and introduces herself perfectly to the plot. The acting I have seen in this movie is not understood until reflection on the movie after you are done and wondering when the next one will be out if there is one. The same feeling you get after reading an introduction novel to the plethora of sequels to come. One series comes to mind, Steven Kings ""The Gun Slinger"" Series, for me, for you would be different I would expect. However the movie will leave you with the same feeling of anticipation.Synopsis, the acting is what pulled this from a book to the screen. I could have not seen any other way to do it, this movie and ultimately the plot is only as good as it is because of the actor's ability to make you believe each word they say.

The books and movie are not exactly alike mind you but there are several similarities scattered throughout the books. Lois Lowry has written a great trilogy of books for adolescent readers and M.

Bravo James Newton Howard and Hilary Hahn.The perspectives in this movie also mesmerized me. Most notably: Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard) running blind through the woods. Filming her face only (blinding her along with the audience to where she was running) was a masterful move up in the ranks of Jean-Luc Godard.The film is listed on Ebert's ""Most Hated"" list... but lately, it has seemed to carry into cult status and has gained a more positive reception.

1479,bogdanmenn,"decent start, then fell apart",3,30 May 2005,"the first hour or so was okay. but the second half, when the 'twist' came into play, just didn't work. the 'implausibles' just mounted up and made it impossible for any reasonable viewer to continue to suspend their disbelief.some examples:1. william hurt is supposed to have helped establish the village community because he thinks that the modern world is brutal and barbaric. yet he allows his blind daughter, thoroughly unused to the modern world, to go wandering off to find medicine! this is just crazy. he is supposed to be reassured by the fact that she is acting out of love and this will protect her. this does not fit with the disillusioned man he is supposed to be.2. given the ages of Ivy, Lucius, Ivy's sister, etc. the community must be going about 20 years. so, how many cases of breast cancer, testicular cancer, kidney failure, complications in pregnancy and childbirth, strokes, etc happened during this period? and now because Ivy has a (very) recent love it all comes apart? ludicrous.3. generally, would people really think it is worth it? all the 'needless' deaths, and other harms? remember these people are not religious fanatics who think the modern world is ungodly. they supposedly believe that it's dangerous. but the dangers of such severe isolation are ignored?4. 'those we don't speak of' are just not scary-looking enough. some testosterone-pumped young men would try attacking them with pitchforks or something. 5. haven't any of the young people noticed that when those we don't speak of' visit uncle fred and auntie mary always seem to be missing?6. what about the rest of America? we are supposed to believe that some official has been paid to redirect air traffic. so, what about the FBI and other law enforcement agencies? wouldn't they wonder what is going on in this community? are the kids being educated properly? are they being abused? are people (noah) getting away with murder? to say nothing of the fact that the tabloid TV channels would have reporters crawling all over the place.7. this community could not be viable unless it was huge. there would simply be too much inbreeding. but a big community would make the 'secret' impossible to keep.8. the continual restatement of how much ivy and lucius love each other destroyed the love story that the writer/director had developed.9. hurt's performance was the most wooden i've seen since pinocchio (or hurt's last performance).bottomline: lazy writing. the basic premise was okay but it could not be sustained and shyamalan didn't face up to that.",The Village
1480,CopCarSS,An interesting paradox.,9,3 June 2005,"I missed the movie during the theater run, but was intrigued by the advertisements for it. Having nothing better to do on a Thursday, I rented the film, and popped it in the DVD.I wasn't sure what to expect, as I had heard high praise for it, as well as some quite bitter testaments as well (I paid how much to see this?). I'll declare myself right now; I LOVED this film.That doesn't necessarily mean you will, though. This movie demands commitment of its viewing base. There is a lot of symbolism that demands a closer look. There's a couple interesting twists to the plot that add something to the story (though I do wish one had been timed a little better...hence the 9 rating instead of 10). And there's an interesting paradox(related to one of the twists) that one can ponder for hours on. Sort of related to the age old pondery, ""Does the end justify the means?"" If you're ready to commit to a little mental excercise, I predict that you will also enjoy ""The Village."" If you're looking for something to zone out to in your unceasing quest to rid yourself of unused brain cells, ""The Village"" is probably not what you're looking for.",The Village
1481,johnlindacoppell,"Very deep, thought provoking film",9,10 June 2005,"I am disappointed how some reviews have trashed this film for not living up to some ""unknown"" expectation. The allegories presented in this film are too numerous to completely mention. On one level the film speaks of the inability of trying to create a man-made paradise. The Village represents mankind. The Elders represent controlling thought or governance that an individual is able to save himself from evil without the presence of a Saviour. When a character decides to save another from an impending danger, their individual attempt is unsuccessful because they are blind to the truth. The film ends with the question will an individual attempt at providing salvation for one's self be successful without divine help? The answer is provided in the last few scenes. The film proves that evil is inherent in mankind and that Saviour is necessary.",The Village

Personally I absolutely love it, from the gentle paced and eerily slow boiler storyline of simple living in a close knit community with a dark secret to the twists and turns of realisation right up to the finale (not to mention it's all capped off perfectly with an absolutely beautiful score) It's obviously not to everyone's taste but in my opinion it's a gem of a movie.",The Village
1483,spartacus1386,Why lots of people hate this movie.,10,29 June 2005,"This film has met loads of negative criticism for one reason: those doing the criticizing simply don't understand the purpose of the film. Most of the people I know that saw The Village went into the theater wanting or expecting a horror movie. I know, the way it was marketed contributed to this, but I have learned never to go into a Shyamalan film without an open mind. Everyone I know who succeeded in this also succeeded in understanding and loving The Village. Shyamalan's minimalistic style also frustrates some people. Many people want to be told things flat out. Shyamalan lets you know everything you need to, but he is more subtle in how he goes about telling you. For example: you never hear in words that Lucius loves Ivy (at least not until the porch scene). Instead, you are given the knowledge when Lucius says, ""Because he never touches you."" I say, why can't more movies be made like this?The Village is not a horror movie; it is a love story, told in a way completely unique to all others. One aspect of the story that makes it so appealing (to me, at least) is the fact that it is probably the most innocent love story I have ever seen. Lucius and Ivy are not corrupted in any way: they haven't been with anyone else (like many you see today), and they are completely untouched by sin. They are surrounded by evil -- both real and imagined -- yet they remain pure. Even the cinematography reflects this: when they kiss, you don't watch them making out and slobbering all over each other; instead, the camera easily floats away as their lips meet. I could go on and on concerning this subject. For anyone who reads this that hates The Village with a passion, as I know many do, try watching it again with a different mindset. That goes for all of Shyamalan's films. Each one has a very definite theme that, when realized by the viewer, is very touching and satisfying, to say the least. This movie is just too good not to enjoy! spartacus",The Village
1484,nealwebb2000,Corny tale of time warp village.,1,30 June 2005,How William Hurt ever got involved with this nonsensical movie is a mystery. It has about as much of a storyline as Delia Smiths cookery shows. The special effects were obviously done on an extremely tight budget under the influence of ego flexing substances. They are almost farcical. It's this sort of movie that is the scourge of the industry at the moment. It is made to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Whatever the budget was for this film it was to much. This movie was made for the production team alone. No thought was put into what the viewing and paying public might like. Sheer self indulgent amateur film making. Wake up and smell the coffee ! If you like challenging cutting edge movie making avoid this at all costs.,The Village
1485,mr_vercetti_69,traumatizing,1,5 July 2005,"The village is possibly the most disappointing film i've ever seen. immediately the audience is deterred by the disastrous script at which one finds himself/herself cringing at the hap-hazard attempts at older Pennsylvanian speech (which can be explained by the conclusion - but we don't know that while we're subjected to hearing it!). Added to this is how pathetically ""those we do not speak of"" (a title which contends in idiocy with the ""younglings"" of Star Wars episode III) are presented to the audience; besides looking like inside out fish with porcupine spines the techniques used to create tension around them is unoriginal and ineffective. Such clichéd methods as passing an image quickly across the screen accompanied by a spontaneous loud noise does nothing more than wake the audience members who have already fallen asleep.If this isn't bad enough, the film loses all credibility with lines the would be more appropriately suited to Scooby Doo, such as when Noah claims that she will be protected by magic rocks - come on! The actors' contribution hardly helps to lift this cinematic tragedy out of the hole into which it was sure to fall. Adrien Brody, whose performance I have never before been dissatisfied by, cannot distinguish whether his character has Downs or is simply mad, and needless to say neither can the audience. If there's one film you see this summer make sure its not this one for you will be utterly disgusted and disappointed and most likely to such an extent that you will decide not to get one next season.",The Village
1486,Cold187-1,If asked about my least favorite movie of all time - The Village,1,21 August 2005,"This is certainly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The reasons are numerous but the biggest reason is that the ""twist"" was no surprise at all! It was terribly obvious (Iam going to tell you if you read on). And seeing how the ""twist"" was the main engine driving the movie, this really destroyed the entire plot. Even if the surprise real was a surprise it was still a STUPID surprise -PEOPLE IN PORCUPINE COSTUMES... COME THE F_CK ON!!!! The movie probably has some redeeming qualities such as decent acting, nice sets, etc., but the whole foundation and story of the movie was terrible so it is nearly impossible to enjoy anything about it. What makes this movie worse than other terrible movies is that you expect it to be good, to be scary because it was high budget, highly rated and from a (previously)respected director. I want my damn money back. Please don't waste any brain cells on this movie.",The Village

If you haven't watched it u must miss this and you've missed out completely! The amazing thing about this is it's the only horror movie where it's not that scary it is really jumpy but it's fantastic and the story is nail biting! Watch it! The actors used for this film were a good choice Sigourney Weaver is emotional and although she isn't in it that much towards the end she does the movie a good job.

1488,michellemckeown,"So bad, it's almost good. Almost.",3,9 May 2006,"This review contains mild SPOILERS. If you want to know all the plot twists, don't read on. I'm not going to reveal the big secret, which I'm sure you can find in the message boards here. But it would almost be impossible to talk about this movie without revealing anything...******************* This movie is not great. In fact, it's pretty bad. The characters are flat and one-dimensional. And they don't really say much that isn't intended only to move the plot along. The style of dialogue is old-fashioned and contrived; which I'm sure is on purpose, but nevertheless very annoying to listen to.The plot centers around a quaker-ish looking community, set in a time and place we are unsure of at the outset. The villagers live in a meadow surrounded by forests, in which lives ""Of Those We Do Not Speak."" What a strange title. Whichever villager came up with that one surely failed Creative Writing 101. We catch fleeting glimpses ""Of Those"", which I must say are pretty creepy looking creatures with long red robes, big scary heads and long skeletal ""fingers."" They don't really do anything that we can discern, they just walk around looking creepy. The deal is, as long as the villagers stay out of the forest, ""Of Those"" will leave them alone.However, one villager, Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to travel to ""the towns"" to get medicine for the sick people. This requires a romp through the forest. He is forbidden by the town leaders. But when Lucius himself is injured, his would be fiancée Ivy (Bryce Howard) pleads with her father to go get the meds. Her father (William Hurt) happens to be the town's leader, and after some pondering, decides to let her go into the forest that harbors the monsters. Alone.Oh, and did I mention that she is blind? So before sending his blind daughter into the forest by herself to find a road some miles away, her father reveals a big secret to Ivy so that she can manage herself better while alone and blind in the forest. He gives her instructions about how to reach the road and sends her on her way. Something happens in the forest which is maybe a bit unnecessary and left unresolved. And thats about it without revealing whether or not she makes it, gets back to Lucius, etc.There are a lot of great actors in this film that weren't given a lot to work with. It is a flat movie with a few tense moments, but many more that are melodramatic and simply plot driven. I like Shayamalan, but this one was a ""miss"" for me. On the other hand, I would categorize it as one of those movies thats almost so bad it's GOOD. I kind of had fun watching this bad bad movie and moaning and groaning through it. Ignatius J. Reilly would understand. And if you don't know who that is, go read ""A Confederacy of Dunces."" It will be a much more entertaining use of your time than watching this film.",The Village
1489,josejrp,"Pretty Good, M. Night!",9,23 June 2006,"Let me start off by saying I liked this movie. To me, The Village was all about atmosphere, and it had plenty of it. The cinematography was more lush than in all the other M. Night's film's combined, and the color contrasts made for a rich viewing experience. Those contrasts along with the interesting shot compositions and long takes with tracking shots made for an fascinating movie from a purely visual perspective. The soundtrack was also another home run, wonderfully evocative. I would see the movie again just to enjoy some of the shots...The weak link is, of course, the story. Most of what happens is a bit implausible, but I bought it based on the strenghts of M.Night's techniques. I must admit that although I guessed the first twist (the one that dealt with the outside world), I did not guess the twist with the final creature... for a while there, I thought M. was going to have a real creature in the film. Based on that alone, the film worked for me.Surprisingly, the acting by most of the named stars did not impress me too much, but Bryce Dallas Howard had an outstanding performance. Unfortunately, I thought Adrian Brody went way over the top with his performance. I can see why he was pushed to act so goofy (so that the audience would not realize how dangerous he was), but it struck a wrong note for me.Overall, I think I would rank this movie as either on par with The Sixth Sense, or even superior to it. I did not feel cheated like I did on the first viewing of The Sixth Sense, and thought the movie was just awesome to look and listen to.",The Village

After 30 minutes of watching I fell asleep (It was in the cinema) and woke up in the 20-40 last minutes of the movie, and nothing happened, the girl didn't arrive to the city and one of them died.

I know horror fans HATE 'The Village', but for me, I hate horror films; however, is this a horror film? I know there are a LOT of critics of M. Night Shyamalan. Most critics love Sixth Sense, and dismiss everything after that.. well, I hated Sixth Sense. He tells you upfront that Bruce Willis DIES and yet people are surprised? I felt this thought the whole movie, why is Bruce Willis's character an angel? He died. Are Americans that dumb? So, He releases The Village, which is 100% correct on the assessment of how the government treats the 'common people' or 'masses'. We know better that you, so trust us. Don't think outside the box. The truth is, this movie, with the amazing actors and actresses, and plot reveal, and political commentary, is the best memorable movie I can think of in the last 20 years. Later in history we will see more people respecting this movie. Honestly, It is M. Night Shyamalan's Opus. I've seen all his movies and this is the masterpiece that is HIGHLY UNDER-RESPECTED. I guarantee you, that if he would have released this movie in 2017, it would have been nominated for SO MANY Oscars!

1494,alc35,I felt so cheated,2,27 April 2008,"Within the first ten minutes of this movie, I whispered to my companion, ""I think I know the ending. Except I'm going to set myself on fire if I'm right, because it's so awful.""Well folks, I was right. I avoided self-immolation, but several years later I'm still indignant over the loss of that $10 and 2+ hours of my life. Other reviewers have done a fair job of summarizing and analyzing, but there were some particular clunker elements that bear revisiting:The dialogue. Dear lord, who scripted this? I swear to you, at one point the little blind girl actually had to say the words, ""Do you find me too much a tomboy? I so long to do boy things!"" The whole theater exploded in guffaws. I would love to know how many takes it took for her to spit that out with a straight face. This is but one example - minute to minute, the whole script is equally stilted and ridiculous. The Big Dramatic scene. You know, where Baby Phoenix heroically grabs said blind girl's hand and the movie switches into slow-mo ""Chariots of Fire"" mode? A kid a few seats over shouted, ""Yo, this is some ""Titanic"" s**t!"" For which I thank him, because without the comic relief, we all might have been weeping in frustration and rage. And there's so much more. Really, this film was one big train wreck. I'm generally pretty tolerant of those overly precious, self-consciously clever ""thought"" pieces... but the implicit contract is that there has to be SOME substance backing up all that abstract cleverness. M. Night failed to deliver on that promise. I still feel cheated.",The Village

Come ON, we are all grown ups here, I can't be scared by creatures in the woods...;-)))I watched fantastic actors playing low-key and true to life, speaking lines like from an Dickens' novel (though much deeper at times), every single one so intense, so real - it was just amazing ! What a fantastic ride that was ! What a sweet love story, that lives on glances (one-way of course...;-)) and held-back moves, yet full-frontal in your face as the motivator for the quest.

It was high drama, intense, a thriller, a beautiful love story, a story about life and about change. Visually it was beautiful - some images were like a piece of art. I particularly liked the images of the sisters sweeping and dancing on the porch. The music was incredible. I kept playing credits over and over just to hear the music. I then went out and bought the soundtrack. The acting was like more of a stage play then an everyday movie. There was an unexpected twist and the end of the movie that really made it extra special. I would highly recommend this movie.",The Village
1497,SilentJay8,Wow.,1,10 August 2005,"When you consider the enormous number of people involved in the production of a film, from studio execs, to proof readers, to gaffers and grips, it is simply staggering to think that so many things could go so far wrong all in the same film. M. Night was given a pretty high credit limit after the Sixth Sense, and deservedly so, but he's gone way over his limit with this one and hasn't made a payment in months.To start, the story is atrocious and predictable. I won't say too much for fear of spoiling the non-surprises for anyone else who wants to guess along, but the plot, such as it is, is simply dreadful. I don't think it gives away too much to say that towards the end of the movie, it becomes necessary for someone to venture into the dangerous, uncharted, forbidden woods to seek medicine from another town. So who gets sent, you ask? A blind girl. Yeah, a blind girl. They send a girl without the gift of sight to wander through a forest to find medicine in ""the towns."" I guess every sighted person, including her father, was too busy fighting with their agents to go.The acting was unusually wretched. Adrian Brody didn't even phone in this performance, he texted it. Not that he was given much to do. Watching Sigourney Weaver try to choke out this vile dialogue was simply painful. She sounded like she was constantly working off cue cards, and who could blame her? The worst of all, by far, was Bryce Howard as the occasionally blind girl. I say occasionally because her blindness seemed to come and go depending on the scene. When used as a plot point, she's blind as a bat and can barely find her front door from her own porch; when the ""story"" lies elsewhere, she maintains perfect eye contact with everyone she speaks to, moves casually around strange people in strange places, and races through fields like a gazelle. What? In all fairness, the actors may not have been at fault. The direction in this film was some of the worst I've ever seen. Bryce should be a smart enough actress to know that blind people generally don't stare eye-to-eye with people, but in the end, wasn't it Night's job to catch problems and correct them? When he saw an otherwise dignified cast tripping over his clumsy, awkward dialogue, couldn't he have changed it? I guess that's expecting an awful lot from the same man who served up this flaming dog turd of a story in the first place. Even in the realm of films about boys who see dead people, super heroes, and aliens, this story is HIGHLY implausible. HIGHLY.This movie is an affront to good films everywhere. Since most movie-watchers are not avid fans of craft and art, however, seeking only another excuse to stare at a TV and eat popcorn for two hours, films like this will continue to be made, and the viewers will continue to surf to IMDb to give them 7's. Hay carumba...***SPOILER WARNING*** For those of you who have seen it; come on! Talking to dead people I bought; super powers, I bought; alien invasion? Absolutely. But you mean to tell me that in 2005, with GPS satellites that can instantly photograph any address you want and the ever-present threat of terrorism, NO ONE has discovered that a bunch of idiots have erected a giant village in the middle of a protected reserve? NO ONE? When three dozen people from the same town all disappeared at the same time to go start this village, no one went looking for them? Give me a break.",The Village
1498,dave-1930,the village was good,8,21 August 2005,"I disagree with other commenter. the ending twist was not obvious. I found this to be a thoughtful, deep movie with effective dialogue. I had to give Shamalan props as the result was not the typical Hollywood plot. If you go into watching it wanting a horror action movie, you will be disappointed. However, if you go into it with an open mind and like drama/suspense with a good premise, this is a very nice movie! The camera work was effective. Adrian Brody plays a good role albeit not a large one. Rating the Shamalan movies, I'd say The Village was second only to Sixth Sense. It was better than both Signs and Unbreakable.

We are also introduced to the rising star, Bryce Dallas Howard, whose starring role was quite captivating.

1501,kevinb120,Only a 'good' movie if you are a moron,2,10 October 2005,"I can not believe that so many people praise this movie. After the moronic Signs, this takes the cake for trying to make the Sixth Sense work for EVERY movie. Not to digress into Signs which still baffles me as to one of the worst endings in a big-budget movie ever, The Village REAKS of a quick fix ending as bad as a 'it was just a dream' wake up revolution/solution.It's like a very short story dragged out in character over development to fill time. It could of been filled with some sort of believable explanation for the children in the beginning as to HOW they got in the situation, and sustained their lifestyle for any period of time. Nothing was done to give a sense of history of the village itself, leaving a huge gap to be filled in trying to make a viewer believe any of this. Have so many people lost their common sense to be able to enjoy this film in any way? Without giving history and making the town completely trapped by the 'people of which we do not speak' we have to believe: That somehow all of their clothes, glass, metals, paint, leather, candles, and lumber mysteriously materialize and come with a never ending supply with no help from the outside world. It is IMPOSSIBLE to sustain life as they do without resources far and beyond what we are shown in the movie. There are so many holes in this alone it is inexcusable. How stupid does he think we are?? There are no vast farms, or cotton, or iron ore mines or foundries, or glass blowers(or sand), or sheep, or, well, never mind, its numbing just thinking about it. Sharpening one blade does not give any history or atmosphere to this movie to make it even 1% believable. There are not nearly enough people in town to have any free time not producing the necessities of life. With some of the children being over 20 years old they would of MAYBE asked where the hell all this stuff came from, don't you think? Apparently the only LOGICAL way this town could ever come into being is that the town was entirely built, and endless food, clothing, candle, and metal supply stored somewhere, and then a handful of adults and a gaggle of infants dropped in and raised over a couple generations, with NO history. Who the hell built the boundary markers?(let alone not bright enough to add a FENCE). And where did the wood they gratuitously use come from if not the FOREST. The first time I saw this movie this was coming to light within the first hour, the second viewing makes it painfully obvious. Stupid.Not to mention books, and if we are venturing to attempt to believe this possibly makes any sense, language. How did English speaking settlers get here? A 1 minute 'history' is attempted near the end of the movie, but it equates to a populous 'air drop' implied above. He also gives her a mission after telling his daughter it's a lie, yet we are supposed to be scared of the 'monsters', oh, and send the blind girl.... Why would she be afraid of now 'fake' monsters anyway? Come on.And the ending??? whatever. Signs was stupid, this is beyond it if its possible. Take your brain out of your head and put it on the coffee table and watch the film, its the only way you can watch it more then once. If the movie had an 18th century 'end' it might of had a chance. The movie should of been named ""Holes"" or ""stupid kids"". Most adults can not out wit a 5 year old when it comes to getting into a car, 30 children just go along with everything they're told without question....This fallacy would last no longer with children then the easter bunny or Santa Claus. Face-Off involves much less suspension of disbelief. I would of given it 5 stars if it were just bad directing and editing, but only 2 because some semblance of 'intelligence' is attempting to be implied.View it once its like wtf was I really THAT robbed of a conclusion? The second viewing reveals how utterly stupid this movie is.",The Village

1503,janet_letsgo,wonderful love story,10,17 October 2005,"i think this film is wonderful. M. Night Shyamalan is a brilliant director all of his films are of first class quality and this one is of no difference. He never seems to fail in giving an excitingly wonderful twist, and the actors chosen to be characters in his films are complete complements to them in every way. the romance and love of ivy and Lucius came through so clearly, it spoke beyond human reach. he shows how love is all one needs to survive in this world in a way that is believable yet not at the same time because 'the village' is set in a some what 19th century setting for the towns people.Bryce Dallas and Joaquin Phoenix perform the main parts practically perfect and i don't think anyone else could of played them better.They act just as i imagine two people in that deep of love would act and their body language and voice shows it now M. Night Shyamalan may not have been aiming for this type of 'apperance or theme' that i got from this movie but i believe that if he was he pulled it off perfectly. love i believe is an emotion not many directors can achieve in films if it is not truly there but M. Night Shyamalan does and for that i solute him.",The Village
1504,Fra_Dolcino,"Banal plot, good acting, superb image",7,27 October 2006,"The plot here is far from being new. There is nothing bad about that in the end, since the idea of a self/isolated community governed by some taboos was always very challenging. What I didn't like about the movie is that, first of all, everything was too predictable for a movie that has mystery and thriller as key words. Secondly, I found it sometimes boring; for me there were some scenes (like those with the elders' council) that were too long and it seemed to me that the producer wanted to gain some more minutes. So, shorter would have been better. The acting was very good, especially Bryce Howard, who was really great, very natural and really Ivy Walker... What I really loved about the movie, and really stroke me from the first minutes it's the image. It is not about the location for shooting the movie, (since the forest is in no way different than others) but is about the way it was filmed, one could sense the movement of the nature (I could hardly find a more appropriate term). It was as if there was always something around, and I'm not referring at those stupid red creatures. I just think that the way cameras were used saved the movie.",The Village
1505,snowolfcomms,Possibly one of the worst films I have ever seen,1,2 November 2005,"Well, there I am on holiday in Florida with 2 hours to kill so I purchase The Village. After enjoying The Sixth Sense and hating Signs it was time to see if M. Night Shyamalan could tip the balance back in his favour - and boy has he failed! A totally unbelievable story that in any context just does not work. How can one man waste so much talent on offer, it defies belief (a bit like the script). And, in keeping with Signs, the tag line of this movie should have been 'All of a sudden, nothing happens'. I think this Mr M. Night Shyamalan is now a victim of his own success dolling out rubbish like this. There, I feel better now.",The Village
1506,arecoyk,mixed feelings,6,9 November 2005,"Although I found the movie was lacking a lot of suspense I must say that I was impressed when I watched the DVD the first time. Alone, that is. The atmosphere and the acting (especially by Bryce Dallas Howard) is of high standard. But you are really waiting for ""something"" to happen, and you have to keep waiting and waiting....Nevertheless I decided to watch the DVD for a second time, now together with my wife. I expected her to be just as surprised as I was with the ending, which I considered was worth while the waiting. Well, I misjudged completely.... The second time the movie seemed even more slow. When the surprise at the end was there, my wife was not surprised at all. I wondered why she wasn't surprised at all. She said it was just because these people gave her the impression that they were living in a kind of Amish community..... I have to admit that if you look at the movie like that the movie is not exciting at all.But I have another objection, which is about the originality of the idea for the movie. A few years ago I bought DVD copy of a French movie called ""Le Pacte des loups""(aka ""Brotherhood Of The Wolf""). This movie oozes much more suspense than ""the Village"", has a very good actress too (Monica Belluci) and moreover seems to be the blueprint for the idea used in ""The Village"".

There were times when this movie was fun, hence why I gave it 4 stars instead of 1 or 2. The laughing guy(can't remember his name) really creeped me out in a cool way. The story was good for a good part of the time, but what ruined it for me was the ending. Shyamalan, sir? What were you thinking or should I ask ""What weren't you thinking?"" The twist at the end was so weak and I know I'm not the only one who thinks so. Usually blah endings don't bother me so much, but you expect a good twist at the end or at least a decent ending, but to have the twist as lame as ""omg, this isn't set in the time frame we thought."" Come on. You can do better. I've seen ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" and I know he's capable of better than this twist. ""Signs"" obviously doesn't count, because has no real twist exactly and most of the film was great and nothing was ruined. As far as I'm concerned this is Shyamalan's first mistake in the movie making business. I know he's capable of better. Let's hope he doesn't repeat the same mistake again like he did with this one. It's OK, Shyamalan I still like you.",The Village

What i like best in movies is their power to drag you into the story, to create atmosphere and to present a world, real or not, that can make you think after you have seen the film. And this movie had a little bit of all these things. The camera movement was, i think, to ""spectacular"" sometimes but hack, nobody is perfect; it just has to have something to offer, something different.Sooo, give this movie a chance.",The Village
1510,fairy_princess1126,The Sense of Symbolism in The Sixth Sense (spoilers),8,16 December 2005,"The Sense of Symbolism In The Sixth Sense, the color red represents sanctuary and a sense of feeling safe, as well as a sign of fear because the use of red with Cole signifies his wanting to be safe from the ghosts, and because the red also shows the first signs of ghosts and fear. Furthermore, the use of red throughout the movie gives certain hints to the fact that something happened.Being a young boy who sees ghosts can be terrifying. The sense of feeling safe could be extremely hard to find, especially if the ghosts appear at anytime. Cole, the boy, is left with only his mother after his parent's divorce. This seems to be the main problem, but later on in the movie, we realize that it's not that at all. Cole sees dead people. These ghosts scare him so he finds places where he feels safe. He often goes into the church, which has bright red doors. In the church, he plays by himself and stays there as often as he can. He also steals a small statue of Jesus, who is wearing a red robe. This stands out because the Jesus is the only statue wearing red. He then takes it back to his house, where he has a red fort in his room made out of blankets. Inside the tent, he has many figurines of Jesus and crucifixes. He feels that the fort is his sanctuary from the ghosts.Dr. Crow, played by Bruce Willis, is a child psychologist who tries to help Cole through his problems. Once a bond is formed between Cole and Dr. Crow, Cole tells him his secret of seeing ghosts. Dr. Crow is skeptical of this, of course, but later finds similarities between Cole and an old patient of his. He finds that not only is Cole telling the truth, but his past patient also had the ""sixth sense"" of seeing the dead. Dr. Crow finds his sanctuary in the basement of his house. In the basement, he holds all this past records of old patients, and does research in order to help Cole. Oddly enough, the door to the basement is all white, but the doorknob is red. This stands out against the white and shows that the basement is where he feels safe and where he can find some answers.Even though red symbolizes the feeling of being safe, it also shows fear and the first signs of ghosts. Cole doesn't fit in and he realizes this. He dreads going to school everyday. The school is painted red, and shows his fear of not fitting in, and also shows that maybe something happened earlier there. Later on, Cole tells us that the school used to be an old courthouse where they hung people. He knows this because he sees ghosts hanging from the ceiling. Dr. Crow talks to Cole about his problems and asks him if he ever writes upset words. These are words that come randomly that one just writes downs without knowing what they are writing. Cole has done this, and it shows the writings that he did, which are in red ink. Throughout the movie, Anna, Dr. Crow's wife, seems very distant from him. He finds pills in the bathroom that are for depression. He has no idea what is going on, but the pills are red, which can symbolize her inner fear of losing him. Red can either show fear or sanctuary.The use of red also shows that something happened that the audience isn't aware of. For instance, a young girl visits Cole and wants to tell him to give her father a box. Cole and Dr. Crow went to the girl's funeral to find that the mother of the girl was keeping her sick. When the mother is first shown, she is wearing a bright red dress at a funeral. She stands out against all the black. This shows that there is something going on that the audience doesn't know about.The Sixth Sense is a great movie that has plenty of twists and turns that keeps the audience hooked from the opening scene. If you're a person who wants to be able to sit there and think about everything you just saw when the movie is over, then The Sixth Sense is the right movie for you.",The Village

It's about love and courage set in a fascinating scenario with the classic Shyamalan ""twist."" Bryce Dallas Howard did a stellar job. I look forward to seeing more of her.

1513,ZerToOne,They missed what they tried to do,2,1 January 2006,"I finally rent this movie to watch it and expected it to be a good movie, but what a piece of crap it was. After 60 minutes watching to some retarded dudes that are told by there parents not to enter the forest cause the evil monsters that live in there would kill them if they do.. you are ready to punch in your TV screen and hope the monsters will slaughter them all. There are basically 5 reasons why this movie sucks (1) The concept of a village with people locked from the outside world surrounded by a forest full of monsters could be good if A: there was good acting B: there was a decent script and C: YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SEE MONSTERS SLAUGHTER PEOPLE.(2) After hearing the parents say after 1 hour for the 10th time the words :THEM WE DON'T SPEAK OFF"" (meaning the monsters) you ask yourself this question why am i still watching and how can a movie be so boring?(3) The love romance between the blind lady and the retards are so NOT amusing and the talking so immense long with nothing then boredom and more boredom. Don't even have me started about all the parents that talk about each other like a club full of over-aged grannies that have nothing better to do. For the 5 seconds you see the fake (monsters) you don't have to watch this movie either cause its really not cool at all.(4) Even if the movie makers didn't had the intention to make a horror movie but some kind of psychological drama about the scars that some people carry and why they want a other life away from the (normal world), it is still no excuse to make such a boring movie with almost no action or horror or a good plot line at all. On the moment they actually enter the forest you already know the monsters are fake (yes they are) and so the movie is shot by his self.(5) The casts acting is so robotic and the script so boring( did i just say boring for the 10th time? and YES IT IS THAT BORING) that this movie drags his self to the end and you don't care at all about their stupid little village outside in the woods and their reasons to stay there.This movie was a waste of my time and gets a 2 star.",The Village

If The Village had any thrill or suspense to it I would be watching it with my undivided attention. First of all, the characters are two dimensional. Adrian Brody can't play any more than a bumbling idiot while Joaquin Pheonix spends his academy award winning performance in a coma. The plot is far-fetched and the monster (which was supposed to be scary) made me laugh in the theater and now. And its not just me, according someone else, ""(The monsters) are roadkill porcupines on the loose"". And this really is a fitting description for those stupid things. Thats really what makes it so funny. And, when you figure out that they're fake its even better because its really funny to imagine ""the elders"" stumbling around in those moronic costumes.

But plot twists aside (which I personally think are wistfully intriguing) the other film elements combine to make this movie a work of art. The acting is excellent--Bryce Howard is mesmerizing at times--and the soundtrack is one of the beautiful and sad I've ever heard.

1518,hafsah_k_pal,The Village (IMO),2,26 February 2006,"Ivy (Bryce Dallas Howard), Lucius (Joaquin Phoenix) and Noah (Adrian Brody) all live in a stable 19th century community. However, their entrapped by an anonymous being lurking in the uncharted woods. The constant threat that haunts over the self-sufficient society keeps them from retrieving much needed medicines from ""The Towns"". Shyamalan uses controversial yet original plot twists throughout The Village; inspirational for some, but more likely, irritable for most. Yes, it has elements of an engaging horror flick, and is even advertised as a ""hide-behind-pillow"" movie, but nearer the end, it cascades into a gaping hole which was disappointment; almost as disappointing as the fact there are no kids who see dead people or aliens with water issues. It's evidently not to the standard one would expect to perceive from Shyamalan work. It compares to his earlier pieces like a box of luxury Belgium chocolates (his earlier efforts) to an assortment of feet flavoured fruit drops (The Village). The acting from Joaquin Phoenix cannot be touched. Stepping out of his villainous image that I'm sure we all remember from the highly successful Gladiator (2000), Phoenix glides on a more heroic role. He portrays his archetypal character flawlessly; which is precisely what can be expected from an actor of his league. This is more than what can be said for Bryce Dallas Howard, who suddenly finds she's become the protagonist, which in my opinion was far too big a position for her. Seeing past all the confusion in maladvertised genre, The Village comes across as grave drama and Roger Deakins' impressive cinematography should not be discredited in the least, as it is one of very few factors that the film is worth seeing for, that and the twists and turns over-shadowing what is a basis for a love story. An all-round atmospheric thriller that tends to shallow out occasionally. The storyline's not easy on the brain, but if you can be bothered to stay aware long enough, you should encounter some pleasant jumps. See this film if you enjoy jumpy puzzle-movies, if you're a horror fan-who takes to disappointment well-or if you need somewhere to sleep for an hour or two.",The Village

From movie to another, he manages to find different concepts which are really good.I agree there is a lot of cheesy things. The terms ""those we don't speak of"", ""magical rocks"", some 5 years old love scenes and many predictable parts. But overall, I think this movie is a must. It's good and different.

1522,Sublime_1977,"Very Dissapionted, read on to find out why...",1,12 March 2006,"When i first looked at the trailer of this film, and from what i had heard, i was quite excited to view what looked like an exciting fantasy/monster style film. The other thing that enticed me was that Joaquin Phoenix was starring in the film. Okay, so the fist half an hour drew me into the film with promises of tension, suspense, fantasy and the craziness that i yearn for.We meet various characters including a blind girl who can see ""Aura's"" around the people she associates with. We also meet Joaquin Phoenix's character, the stud/down to earth guy who you assume will be the one who battles these demons of the woods. excited? so was I.I find this review very difficult to do without spoiling the film so excuse me, but it all needs to be said.We'll start with the Aura seeing blind girl. Now, if this was a fantasy, as i had initially thought. Then a blind girl viewing peoples Aura's would be all very well and good. But this film is not set in a fantasy world. It is set in the very real and very normal present world. A world where blind people do not see auras, in fact, blind people generally see nothing. Now if the Auras were the only thing that annoyed me, i would not even think of mentioning it. But the stark moment of stupidity for me, was when this blind girl runs through a forest, not once, but twice. yes blind (thought i would just punch that one home for the next part). Okay so a blind girl running through a forest, may not sound easy, but plausible... i agree. In this case... no. She runs at break neck speed through the forest, surprisingly missing the various millions of trees she encounters. in my mind, not possible. OK, so on the first journey she nearly falls down a hole. But to add insult to injury, on a long journey through a forest going in one direction, she manages to remember where the hole is in the opposite direction so that she stops right in front of it to trap her mysterious pursuer. I have met blind people and yes, they know their house inside out and can manage to find there way round using various techniques. But if any one of them were to run recklessly through a forest, i guarantee that they would at the very least trip on a branch or scratch themselves to hell.So what more could infuriate me about this film? The star of the film in my eyes was Joaquin Phoenix, and in many ways was one of the only reasons i watched this film. So it shocked and greatly displeased me, when after only a short time, his part in the film was extinguished. I wont say what happens, but it caused me to verbally (quite loudly actually) express my great displeasure in the cinema... In my eyes, you don't kill off the star of the film in the first 20 minutes of the film, unless you bring him back from the dead. The only person who was holding this film together. tut tut. Imagine this, you are a 20-30 year old red blooded male growing up in a village that is haunted by creatures that lurk in the woods. Although it is made very clear to you that the woods are dangerous, you have noticed that everyone is very much alive, and no-one has died. Well, no one has died from being brutalised by hell bound creatures of the dark. If there is one thing you can count on in human nature, it is curiosity. Curiosity is what makes characters in horror movies walk up the stairs leaving their safe exit from the house, so that they might at least know what knifed their boyfriend/girlfriend to death. So i find it hard to believe that they have had this village for so long, yet none of the proud male (or female even, i'm not being sexist so don't even start)... i dunno, start a revolution against the evilness that submerges the forest.To explain the next part and not ruin the plot is impossible. Someone gets hurt badly in the village. Out of everyone in the village (population being... oh i dunno, around 100 or so) they pick a blind girl (sigh) to journey through a forest to get some medicine from a wildlife ranger style hut based near the borders of the area. Now... OK, someone is hurt, fair enough... you would want to help. The plain and simple truth is, why on earth did the people who originally thought up and created their idea of a self sustaining village that does not have the influence of the evil £/$, not think to bring the basic essentials... IE medicine. People will get ill and people will injure themselves. separating people from external forces forcefully is one thing, keeping them there by scaring them with stories of monsters is quite another. But to create a society with no external influence, without thinking to bring the vital components such as antibiotics and the likes, is unforgivable.I have gone on and i'm not sure how many people will even see this review, let alone listen to what i have to say. However, truth be told, i needed to get it out of my system as i feel like i have wasted hard earned cash on this film. its not much, but money is money and i would have much preferred to buy some paint to watch it dry than to witness this travesty to cinema. See the film and make your own opinion, adiós.",The Village
1523,nerny01,Another one of M. Night Shyamalan's suspenseful twists,7,20 March 2006,"The Village is not the scary movie that it was advertised to be. It is a suspenseful yet intellectually stimulating film that explores the use of fear and deceit as a means of control. Each twist in the film will reveal another key to unlocking the mysteries of the little town of Covington. Shyamalan will inevitably conclude with a similar upbeat ending to that of his earlier film Signs.In the opening scene, a funeral for a young boy, Daniel Nicholson, tells that the setting of the film is in the nineteenth-century. The small village of Covington is isolated in the middle of a Pennsylvanian valley which has established its own customs and rituals. The village is run by a council of Elders, much like that of an Amish or Mennonite community. Oddly enough, the forest surrounding the village is plagued by a mysterious group of alien-looking creatures, reminiscent to that of Star Wars or the Beast Master. In order to keep the peace, the villagers make animal sacrifices and never venture into the forest. The color red is deemed forbidden, while yellow is considered a protective color in this film. The peace between the creatures and the villagers begins to waver. As a result, many animals are found skinned and red marks are found on the doors of homes.A struggle of confinement begins to surface within the characters. Lucius Hunt played by Joaquin Phoenix struggles to show his love for Ivy Walker played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Edward Walker played by William Hurt and Alice Hunt played by Sigourney Weaver struggle over their love for their children and vow with the other village Elders to breach the forest boundary. William Hurt must make his decision after the jealous, heart broken, and mentally disturbed Noah Percy played by Adrien Brody mortally wounds Joaquin Phoenix and desperately needs medicine. In order to save Joaquin Phoenix's life, Bryce Howard convinces William Hurt to break his vow and let her travel through the woods for help. With the Elders' vow now broken, their control of the village is now compromised. The Elders are now forced to consider revealing their reasons for settling in Covington.Much like how some of the town's men tried to use the fear of the headless horseman to scare Ichabod Crane into leaving in the film Sleepy Hollow, the village Elders used the fear of the creatures to control the other villagers. However, as the Elders find out, staying isolated from the rest of the world is not good.Overall, the photography of the village was amazing. The Village is shot with crisp and clear shots displaying the beautiful foliage and architecture. Shyamalan uses a variety of high and low key lighting to highlight his characters faces in many of the night time settings.Others have described The Village as a parable about the US government using fear to control its citizens as well other countries. The controlling rules of society can make one feel trapped or imprisoned. However, like many childhood nightmares, these fears will pass and can be overcome.",The Village
