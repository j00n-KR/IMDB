0,MartinHafer,A wonderful film...with the word f#@$ used 102030841 times!,9,28 January 2010,"I tried watching this film on TV a few years ago, but I made the mistake of doing so with my kids nearby. In the first 10 minutes of so, I heard 'f#@$' (a word you are NOT allowed to use even once on IMDb) dozens of times. Realizing that the film was NOT family-friendly, I turned it off despite all the very positive reviews I'd read for it. However, considering I've seen all the Coen Brothers films except this one, I knew that eventually I'd get back to seeing it. Nearly a decade has passed, and I finally got around to seeing this cult favorite.Considering that there are nearing 1000 reviews for this film, I won't bother discussing the plot--it's been explained to death. Besides, the plot, believe it or not, is not all that important. As a mystery film, the mystery is figured out early in the film. So, despite this, why is the film so good--good enough that I gave it a 9 and many consider it their favorite film ever? Well, the Coen Brothers' bizarre and surreal style really make this film and off the top of my head I can only think of two of their films I liked better, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (their most underrated film) and OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (their film that gets better with each viewing). This is very good company, as these two other films are absolutely brilliant--and I consider THE BIG LEBOWSKI to be much more interesting that the much ballyhooed FARGO (which, inexplicably, won two Oscars--despite not being among the brothers' best films because it's way too normal--sort of like a Coen Brothers film for those who don't get the more bizarre Coen Brothers films).What, in particular, did I like? Well, the characters were THE best part of the film--as only the Coens can create such quirky and unique characters. Simply put, there is no one like Lebowski in any of the thousands and thousands of films I'd seen before--and uniqueness is something I value most in a film. The alcoholic, lazy and hopelessly pathetic guy is like no hero you'll ever see in a film! The usual quirky characters are here as well--in spades! What I also loved were the little movies within the movie. When Lebowski got knocked out, you got to see his bizarre dreams that were more like films than dreams--particularly the one later in the film that just killed me it was so funny and stylish. Believe it or not, the dream is a phallic-filled song and dance film...directed by a famous porno director (though without actual nudity). It just has to be seen to be believed and only HUDSUCKER PROXY had stranger and more entertaining interludes. In fact, I found myself laughing out loud at this great scene...and a few more.Overall, a highly imaginative and wonderfully quirky film with very little plot and gobs of cursing. NOT family-friendly or a film to show your mother (unless you DO want to give her a heart attack), but still well worth seeing. Oh, and by the way, the version often shown on TV recently is an edited version with many of the expletives removed. The original actors provided alternative words for the f-bomb and it's done reasonably seamlessly. Frankly, I don't think it hurts the film and you still get to hear words like penis which have not been changed.",The Big Lebowski
1,Leofwine_draca,Affectionate stoner comedy,6,8 September 2016,"I've never been a huge fan of American stoner comedies; as somebody who is staunchly anti-drugs, the type of humour in these movies doesn't appeal and I usually just find them dumb. Not so with THE BIG LEBOWSK, the cult classic movie by the Coen brothers; this one's well-written and features an endearing cast of typically kooky characters in a plot that is very reminiscent of the Coen brothers style.Jeff Bridges plays the likable lead as an exasperated chump who refuses to lose his mild-mannered world view despite getting mixed up in a plot involving reclusive millionaires and revolutionary weirdos. It helps that he has a fine supporting cast, in particular John Goodman who is cast completely against type as a far-right nut job who word has it was modelled on John Milius. Steve Buscemi is also a delight, even though he doesn't appear much; I tend to find everything that comes out of this guy's mouth to be completely hilarious.The script is incessantly profane and yet, as in a Tarantino movie, the bad language has a natural flow and rhythm to it; it never feels forced or unpleasant. The oddball plot flows along nicely and there are few slow spots or mistakes along the way (an excruciating turn from Julianne Moore unwisely attempting a British accent being my only real problem with this). THE BIG LEBOWSKI, although not my favourite Coen brothers movie due to the subject matter, is a lot of goofy fun nonetheless.",The Big Lebowski
2,SnoopyStyle,"unique, weird, but not that funny",6,30 July 2014,"It's 1990. Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a lazy bum who insists on being called Dude. Two thugs break in to shake him down and pee on his rug. They soon realize they're mistaken. They're looking for the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) whose young wife Bunny ran up a debt. The Dude's unstable friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) convinces him to go see the rich Lebowski for compensation for the rug. Later Bunny is kidnapped for a $1M ransom. Rich Lebowski asks the Dude to do the ransom hand off. Walter tries to double cross the kidnappers but the drop off goes terribly wrong. The money is stolen. All the while, the Dude and Walter is in a bowling tournament with Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is Lebowski's daughter who wants the Dude to recover the money from the kidnappers.This is crazy Coen movie. This is a weird black comedy. It reminds me of the craziest parts of 'Raising Arizona'. It's a little too meandering with weird characters coming in every few minutes. This is much more weird than funny. I found only a few big laughs like the fking toe. On the other hand, it is completely unique. A lot of it is weird for weird's sake. It's a lot of weird. I get the sense that this is a great movie to have a good smoke while watching it.",The Big Lebowski
3,Hitchcoc,"Goodman and Bridges, Oh My!",9,1 September 2010,"This is one of those movies I never got around to seeing. It is one of the most delightful black comedies of all time. Watching the byplay between the frenetic John Goodman and Jeff Bridges is priceless. The plot is all over the place and we are played once in a while, but the excitement is in the journey, not the end. Bridges' character is the laid back, sixties protest type who is accosted one day (a case of mistaken identity) as a couple of thugs beat him and one pees on his rug. This sets in motion and effort to find the man who shares his name and get his rug replaced (he ultimately steals one of the man's rugs). This sets off John Goodman (a poster child for anger management). They become involved in a kidnapping drop and I can't begin to explain the rest. Suffice it to say, these guys have a great chemistry and all Bridges can do is watch the dominoes fall. Goodman has made a career of playing lovable psychos for the Coen Brothers. This may be his masterpiece.",The Big Lebowski
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Pederasts, nihilists and rugs",8,5 September 2017,"Sounds like a Three Stooges short no? But wait and see: ""The Big Lebowski"" is an American 2-hour film from 1998, so this one will have its 20th anniversary next year. It is of course by the Oscar-winning Coen Brothers and even without gigantic awards attention, this is definitely a contender for their most known as it has turned into a real cult classic over the years. This is also thanks to the cast, not just to the script. There are three performers in here who won acting Oscars later in their careers, namely the late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore and of course Jeff Bridges who plays the central character in here and who is really good at it, even if I might give the edge to John Goodman (Argo, Roseanne) here in terms of who I'd pick as the film's MVP. But there's also people in here that you would not necessarily expect like Tara Reid or RHCP's Flea. And then there's Coen regulars like Stormare, Buscemi (both Fargo) and Turturro (Barton Fink). A lot of fun for sure. The Coens once again succeed in writing even the minor characters in a way where they stay in mind thanks to their mannerisms and behavioral patterns. Very well done and this tendency has elevated many Coen films. And as absurd as these characters may occasionally seem, there is still something authentic to them. You never get the impression that you are actually watching actors in roles here, but they feel like actual people. Of course, on the other hand, not everything is perfect with this movie. The scenes with Julianne Moore didn't do too much for me, especially her early scenes. Sam Elliott I also could have done without. I like his narration voice, that would have been enough although his conversation with Bridges' character was also fine in the middle of the film and how they talk about cowboy looks, profanity etc. But with him saying the final words, the film did not exactly close at its best I suppose. Also kinda feel he has a tendency to always play the same character and it seems that back then he looked exactly the way he looks today. But for every negative criticism I have, there are at least five positive things for me to say about this film. The best example is really everything involving John Goodman. His scene with the gun was a riot, only the Coens can depict an actually dangerous situation in a manner as hilarious and entertaining as they did here. His scene in the car when they are about to give the money to the abductors is even better and how he keeps talking about beating the crap out of them. And it's no empty words either as we find out eventually when he runs indeed into the three German nihilists. Poor Buscemi's character. Or, again about Goodman, his recurring words directed at Buscemi's character. Or how he keeps mentioning Vietnam to show how tough he is. And if we are talking about recurring references already, Bridges' character has his own too of course, such as how he keeps ordering the same drink, even if they may not be as good as Goodman's. The dialogue writing is top-notch here for sure and even if this is always the case with the Coens and their films, we should not take it for granted. Too many examples. One that stayed in the mind for me is the ""let me take another look"" (or something like that) when the bad guys keep pushing his head inside the toilet early on. What a cool dude. No pun intended.As a result, we get many hilarious scenes like at the bowling alley early on (e.g. the gun scene) or also all the scenes with the Dude and Lebowski. I had to laugh so hard at some of these. Yes the film maybe got a bit worse in the second half and maybe the story took two or three plot twists and roads that may have been too absurd, but at this point it doesn't really matter anymore as you are truly sucked in by the entertainment. It's also not a film where you really wonder what will happen to the protagonists or care about them deeply. Instead, you just enjoy the moment and what is happening to them this very instant. Good acting, strong writing, hilarious scenes that turn the eventual outcome into one of the very best of 1998, especially in the first 60 minutes. So of course I give it four stars out of five. I (highly) recommend checking it out if you are one of the very few who have not yet seen it. Also a must-see for bowling lovers. And as for the Coens' quality, just pick Tara Reid, whose career has gone down the drain considerably, but so talented people like the duo of writers and directors here effortlessly install her in a movie that has turned into a classic without any bad impact at all. Admittedly, this is also because of her looks of course because really she does not have a lot to put on display in terms of range and versatility. She has that conversation with the Dude early on at the mansion and finally we see her in the car and that's it, but maybe this lack of a challenge was why they picked her. I immediately had to think of another character in an early Tarantino movie. I am sure you know who I am talking about. Anyway, let's not drift away from this one as there is a lot more to say here. For example, I mentioned the scene in the car. This was one example of how effortless good the Coens are when it comes to storytelling. We find out that indeed she was never kidnapped. We also see she still has all her toes and we see where the actually severed toe came from in another scene in a bar (poor girl!) and this is also pretty unique how the Coens are so strong in depicting somewhat violent moments in comedic light, which always feels pretty unique with them. The only one who does it at least almost as good is again the aforementioned Tarantino. But while he was my favorite earlier and I still like him a lot, I am 100% Team Coen Bros now because honestly, it feels as if I love each and every single film they made. This one here is no exception. It took me until 2017 to watch it for the first time and it was already really good there, but now in 2020 I got the chance to watch it again, for the first time on the big screen of an open air cinema and this was when I really fell in love with this movie. Okay, that is maybe a bit too much to say, but I liked it really a lot and finally see why so many others do too. It has so many funny moments from beginning to end that stem from the great writing, but also equally good acting for sure. These cast members pulled it off perfectly. And with that, I am not just talking about those at the center of the story (also the rich Lebowski for example, sadly not too many know the actor, may he rest in peace), but also those that have very little screen time such as Turturro's character, who is still hilarious though and also the crass difference between his scenes as a colorful bowling starlet and the exact opposite how he has to ring at everybody's door and tell them about his past. Or the German nihilists. And just people who only have one scene. That is always the Coen's strength. They make every character so damn entertaining. And this film is also a success from the time/political perspective. Could they get away with the Saddam jokes today? And pay attention to how the Dude is considered the ultimate Cannabis consumer in popular media nowadays, but you never see him roll a joint. Times were different back then when it came to depicting drug (ab)use in the movies. But it also shows how progressive and ahead of its time the film and filmmakers were/are. So no matter what perspective you take, this is a movie you may not want to miss out on under any circumstance and I am glad hardly anybody did looking at how many have seen it. The story may not be perfect, but it never really is 100% about the story anyway. You forget quickly how the Dude and Goodman's character realize it was all a scam maybe a little too quickly because you are so in awe about all the wonderfully delightful and entertaining moments like the silent boy whose paper they find in the car etc. Like I said, mentioning everything that is funny in this movie is virtually impossible because I would run into the character limit soon and still not have listed half of it all. That is why you need to experience this wonderful film yourself. Actually it made me consider buying a rug again, one that really works the place. Nuff said. Highly, highly recommended. Also some wonderful use of music here I have to put on my player immediately, such as the Eagles song (sorry Dude, it's good), ""what condition my condition was in"" or a not too famous version of ""Viva las Vegas"". All gems. The Coens are really this good with music too in their works. And you also get the usual Jew reference (special occasion here) showing us they do not take themselves seriously at all, a tradition that mounted with full speed into the even better ""A Serious Man"" later on. A gem that movie as well. This one here too. What are you waiting for?",The Big Lebowski
5,Prismark10,The Big Lebowski,7,25 January 2021,"The Coen Brothers go back to their quirky black comedy roots of Crimewave and Raising Arizona.The Big Lebowski is a stoner comedy fantasy with larger than life characters.Set in the early 1990s during the time of the first Iraq war.Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is the Dude. A middle aged stoner unemployed waster. The antithesis of Reagan's America.His apartment is broken into by two thugs who mistaken him for the millionaire Lebowski. One of them urinates in his rug which upsets the Dude.The Dude loves ten pin bowling and he has strangely weird friends like the loud and gung ho Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) as well as the timid and silly Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi.)The Dude sets off to find Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) who is a wealthy man in a wheelchair with a much younger trophy wife called Bunny.When Bunny goes missing and is feared kidnapped. The Dude is called in by The Big Lebowski to deliver the ransom money and learn if the kidnappers are the same thugs who broke into his apartment.Walter wants to double cross the kidnappers by keeping the ransom money. The Dude speculates if the kidnaping is a scam by Bunny who was in debt.The drop off goes wrong and the ransom money is stolen. The Dude later meets The Big Lebowski's daughter Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) who tells him that her father is not as wealthy as he makes out to be.Despite the far out absurdist comedy and the fantasy sequences. In his heart this is a neo noir counterculture comedy thriller of mistaken identity and double crosses. It is the Dude who figures out just what is happening but needs Walter for the muscle when more nihilist thugs turn up.It has acquired a cult status mainly because of the performances of Bridges, Goodman and John Turturro as Jesus Quintana the stylish bowler who exposed himself to an eight year old girl.",The Big Lebowski
6,kosmasp,The Dude abides ... and watches,10,2 August 2021,"And swears a lot - and of course there is alcohol and other drugs involved too. I did not remember the small amount of nudity we do get to see - it had been way too long since I last watched this. And while I remember having issues with the humor in Fargo (the expecting the ""unexpected""), I know I really dug this. Still I have to rewatch Fargo some day - and then go on with the TV show they made too of course.But back to this - you cannot be easily offended. So much swearing ... so many weird characters (all played by really good actors most would say, even Tara Reid and her short stint in this work more than swell) ... so much craziness. And an episodic journey with his Dudeness. Jeff Bridges has done so many good movies, but this is the one movie he mostly will be remembered for. And he doesn't mind - why should he? Such a fun and over the top script and movie has to be cherished.There are so many iconic scenes, so many quotable things - from the STFU Donny, which is used so many times, to the ""this is what happens when you ... a man in the ..."" - something I can't write here, because the review would therefor not be allowed to exist. And then the iconic car missing scene. Which sprang the title for ""Dude where's my car"" ... at least that's how the story goes.The movie may be 2 hours long, but at no time did I feel the length of it ... wait, that may be a pun? Not as obvious as Jesus cleaning his (bowling) ball ... but still! Also nobody ... with the Jesus! I almost want to check the quotes section imdb has for the movie ... so many things they cannot write I assume.Anyway, the movie is far out and if you don't like, than I would say: That is very undude of you Dude!",The Big Lebowski
7,classicsoncall,"""That rug really tied the room together, did it not?""",9,26 September 2006,"About thirty years ago I read the word 'micturate' in a story, and it was so intriguingly curious I began using it in conversation with a couple friends of mine (for it's intended appropriate reason of course, like ""Pull over the car, I have to micturate""). I never came across it in high school, college, or anywhere else. It never came up in a TV show, stage play or a film. It's like the word was invented for the sole purpose of never using it. Never once did I ever hear anyone except the members of my trio use the term. Until today. The 'real' Lebowski (David Huddleston) uses the word upon introduction to the Jeff Bridges Lebowski, actually the past tense 'micturated', but close enough. Pretty nuts to get excited about, right?Well if the movie didn't have me right there, I was bound to Coen Brothers fandom with the on screen arrival of Jesus Quintana (John Turturro). It's been a while since I've seen anything as flamboyantly over the top as his introductory first strike capability. If that small bit of inspired genius doesn't grab you, you probably won't go for the rest of the flick either. ""The Big Lebowski"" is a raucous Seinfeld episode on speed, or at least the equivalent of a buzz on too many white Russians.Quite honestly, I was all prepared for the Big L to be John Goodman, but it didn't take long for that slight hint of disappointment to evaporate. Jeff Bridges is a worthy Lebowski in all of his underachieving glory, perfectly complemented by the boisterous brains of the outfit, Walter Sobchak (Goodman). It's too bad Donny (Steve Buscemi) didn't make it to the finale, but hey, not everyone gets to go out in a can of Folger's. Something subliminal there? - why not Maxwell House, 'good to the last drop'. In a tribute to one of filmdom's masters of malapropisms, Walter's speech honors Donny's memory from 'La Joya to Leo Carillo"" - I had to play that one three times.The Big L simply demands viewing more than once, I'm sure I missed a bunch the first time around. It's the story of 'The Dude', a man uniquely qualified to claim his time and place in Los Angeles of the early Nineties. I'm not quite sure, but I think there's an unspoken message here.",The Big Lebowski
8,lee_eisenberg,Let the good times bowl!,10,16 March 2007,"The Coen brothers reached what may have been their zaniest with ""The Big Lebowski"", about stoner Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) getting mistaken for a tycoon (David Huddleston), leading to complete wackiness; needless to say, the wacky factor dominates. Along with Jeff, there's his slacker friends: the motormouth Walter (John Goodman) and the loopy Donny (Steve Buscemi). As for the side characters, I liked Maude's (Julianne Moore) remark about conception, and the narrator's (Sam Elliott) note about Saddam Hussein. It's just a great, hilarious, even humanizing movie. Also starring are John Turturro as a sex offender, and Philip Seymour Hoffman as a servant. FYI, when John Goodman said all that stuff about Judaism, you may have thought that it was total nonsense given his character, but it was all totally accurate.To think: John Goodman starred in four movies within two months. Of the ones that I saw, this one was great, ""Fallen"" was obviously ripped off of Wes Craven's ""Shocker"", and I must have been the only person who liked ""Blues Brothers 2000"".PS: did you notice that the date on the check was September 11, 1991? Hmm...",The Big Lebowski
9,jboothmillard,The Big Lebowski,7,4 March 2008,"With the recent win at the Oscars for writing/directing brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, for No Country For Old Men, it was appropriate that some of their films be on TV, and this one was pretty good. Basically Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is an ageing hippie, and mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski, aka The Big Lebowski (David Huddlestone) who is a millionaire, by two thugs who pee on his carpet. The Dude is then drawn into a kidnap (possibly because of the mistaken identity) of The Big Lebowski's wife, Bunny (American Pie's Tara Reid). It seems that many other people, not just the kidnappers, want something from The Dude, and all probably because they think he's the millionaire. For me, what kept me watching was the great performance by John Goodman as The Dude's aggressive bowling buddy, Walter Sobchak, a bear-like Vietnam-veteran with a serious temper, and a bit of a potty mouth. Also starring Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Steve Buscemi as Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt, John Turturro as Jesus Quintana, Harry Potter's David Thewlis as Knox Harrington and Sam Elliott as The Stranger (the one narrating). There were some funny moments, and the surreal dream sequences were interesting, and the performances (especially Goodman) were all great, so I don't see any reason not to see it. Very good!",The Big Lebowski
10,rmax304823,Relaxed spoof with charm.,6,23 September 2007,"Something about an aging hippie called ""The Dude"" who is hired to find a woman who's kidnapping was faked and who was supposed to be ransomed with fake money, but none of that has anything to do with the film, which makes fun of just about everything, fake or genuine.Among the targets of the Coen brothers' jibes, I was able to identify political correctness, movies about private investigators, Busby Berkley, Njinsky, the psychedelic subculture, pornography, celebrity, the ritual solemnity of funerals, sage old Westerners (cf., Curly in ""City Slickers""), the military mentality, the violent gangs of terrorists with German accents that insist on turning up in action movies, hippies, and Malibu.The acting is just good enough, with Jeff Bridges and John Goodman fitting nicely into their roles. Here's an example of some wit from the dialog. Bridges is a private investigator. He finds his car being broken into by a stranger, pulls the man out, and threatens him. Wait! the other guy shouts. He's a private investigator too, just like Bridges, ""a brother Shamus."" ""Brother Seamus? Like an Irish Monk?""There's a lot of malice in this film but it's undercut by a gentle, easy-going presentation that embodies a certain off-kilter charm and is more likely to lead to smiles than either outright laughter or self-righteous resentment. I forgive it its occasional misdirection.It's not a masterpiece but it's certainly an original piece of work, and it probably ought to be seen for that reason alone, if not for any other. The MBA committees that are currently grinding out the Supersonicburgers in Hollywood should be the first in line. They need the lesson.",The Big Lebowski
11,Tweekums,Simply Hilarious,9,18 April 2008,"This is the funniest of the Coen brother's films that I've seen to date. The film follows the story of slacker Jeffrey Lebowski (AKA The Dude) who is mistaken for a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski by a couple of thugs wanting money owed by the latter's wife.Encouraged by his easily angered friend Walter, The Dude goes to see the other Lebowski to get a rug to replace one damaged by the thugs. When Lebowki's wife is kidnapped he asks The Dude to help deliver the ransom. While this is going on The Dude and his friends are also involved in preparations for a bowling match.From then on things get stranger and stranger in events featuring German nihilists, a pornographer, Lebowski's daughter and a bowler by the name of Jesus.The cast led by Jeff Bridges is excellent as the story is fun and in places rather surreal, if you don't mind a lot of swearing and enjoy a good laugh this film is a must see.",The Big Lebowski
12,moonspinner55,Hugely entertaining!,7,14 December 2006,"Pacifists vs. nihilists comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen is predictably (and amusingly) weird and lively, and so full of comic tension and malice that it is nearly irrelevant the 'plot' (as such) does peter out after the first hour. A bearded, unemployed, pot-smoking holdover from the '60s becomes entangled in corruption after he's hired to be the ransom-courier in a kidnapping. As the Dude, Jeff Bridges gives his all to this loose, shaggy character; the Dude is not just a textbook hipster, slacker or fish out of water, he's a laid-back guy cartoonishly naive of the craziness inherent in this new generation's loss of morals, and he's so generally good-hearted that he's blindsided by violence and craven villainy. The Coens nearly outdo themselves in creating eccentric, mercurial characters, cutting twisty corners with an irony that isn't condescending or too obvious, and their cinematic conception of this material is often dazzling. *** from ****",The Big Lebowski
13,blanche-2,for baby boomers - The Dude abides,10,9 July 2000,"I'm not sure The Big Lebowski is for everyone, but for my money it's one of the funniest comedies ever, a very impressive production from the Coen Brothers.Over the years, the Coens have knocked my socks off. They have their heavy-duty films like No Country for Old Men, Barton Fink, and their satires like the Hudsucker Proxy - it seems as if they can do anything.This is a very, very funny and offbeat film with crazy characters, acid flashbacks, and bizarre situations -- a true baby boomer movie about The Dude (Jeff Bridges) whose name is Jeff Lebowski, who is mistaken for another Lebowski whose wife owes money all over town. Goons try to get the money from him; he winds up working for the other Lebowski when his porn star wife is kidnapped. Along for the ride are two of his bowling buddies, Walter, a Vietnam vet who, though not Jewish, observes the shabbat, and Steve (Steve Buscemi). Julianne Moore plays Maude, the daughter of the Big Lebowski. My favorite part of the movie -- I have many, but my favorite part is one of the last scenes which I won't give away. The acting is fantastic, with Jeff Bridges totally inhabiting the Dude and John Goodman in one of his best performances.A flop when it opened, over the years, The Big Lebowski has deservedly become a classic as it found its audience. It's now rated in the top 250 on IMDb, which is only right.",The Big Lebowski
14,Quinoa1984,"Arguably the Coen Brother's funniest work, with a superb lead in Bridges",10,9 September 2004,"The Big Lebowski, whether you laugh during the film or not, is assuredly one of the most laid-back of the nineties. I don't mean that by saying that its main fan-base are slackers or hippies or other, but that the whole tone of the film has that air to it. The plot the Coens construct, which is as wonderfully convoluted as a 40's mystery tale (the kinds of stories they get inspired by- The Big Sleep was most likely their title goof), almost gets in the way of the main character and his friends' lives. ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) has a good, if devoid of ""meaning"", life- he bowls constantly with his crazed, Vietnam-vet friend Walter (John Goodman, also very note-worthy) and quiet friend Donny (Steve Buscemi, a fine performance based mostly on reactions), with the occasional setback or weirdo to confront him (i.e. John Turturro's Jesus, a highlight in the film's most absurd moments). Enter in a group of deranged ex-musicians turned nihilists (which include the likes of Peter Stormare and Flea), a pornographer, and a rich man with the same name as Lebowski and his family, and the Dude's cycle is turned upside down, though not knocking into his chemical intake.On top of The Big Lebowski, at the core, one of the most odd, off-the-wall, and creative of the Coens' scripts, with a interesting story and dialog as real as it is sometimes insane, the casting is near perfect, if not so already. It's been said by the Coens that they write some of the parts specifically for the actors, and it shows because it's pulled off. Aside from some usual Coen regulars that don't disappoint, Bridges, for lack of a better term, displays his versatility in taking on this role. Often his roles are of the normal-Joe or the businessman, but what the Coens see is that with the right character he can be funny, and make the people around him just as funny. Not to say there aren't serious parts in the film, where he's put into a rut of conflict by way of the plot. But by the time the audience starts to shift its mindset, another strange, surreal, and/or hallucinogenic bit is kicked in. Throw in some unique production design, and Roger Deakins' expert eye on the scenes (will there ever be another film that captures bowling the way this film does, or at least in such scope and lack of subtlety?), and The Big Lebowski ends up as a cult classic. Not the kind of film that could really play for long in a multiplex (it made back its budget during its run, but not by much), yet one that will continue to have at least a little relevance in not just the indie crowd and Coen fans, but with the kinds of movie viewers who like to have a film on during a party or get-together. In fact, I'd say this beats films like Dazed and Confused and Mallrats as being something that can appeal to a younger (and older, depends) viewing crowd with its ridiculous set-pieces and still be a considerable artistic achievement. Look at it this way, think of the silliest, though smartest Cheech and Chong or Three Stooges film you've seen, and when filtered through a mindset that's loaded with European and film-noir influences, and you'll get The Big Lebowski. Not to mention it's one of the most quotable comedies of the 90's, and has a toe-tapping soundtrack. A+",The Big Lebowski
15,edwagreen,The Big Lebowski is Simply Awful *,1,7 December 2013,"What a ridiculous farce this 1998 film is. Julianne Moore is pretty funny with her Katharine Hepburn like speech. Other than that, the film is from absolute hunger as the Coen Brothers again are trying to explore the obnoxious things of life.Lebowski, Jeff Bridges, is confused with someone with the same last name, whose second much younger wife has been borrowing money all over town. When she disappears and a ransom note comes up, the wealthy Lebowski enlists the aid of Bridges to act as a go-between. Seems that Lebowski was mistaken for the other and the crooks urinated on his rug. To get even, Bridges takes the rug of the wealthier man as pay back.Of course, Lebowski and his sidekick, John Goodman, a Catholic who is divorced from a Jewish woman and has adopted Orthodox Judaism, by being a sabbath observer, feel the woman staged the kidnapping.The rest of this ridiculous film is devoted to crazy plot twists along the way. It wasn't appreciated when a certain four letter word was used to describe a synagogue.",The Big Lebowski

For some reason, Mr. Bridges' toilet bowl looks like it was filled with milk instead of lemonade. The intruders have mistaken Bridges for ultra-wealthy David Huddleston (as Jeffrey ""The Big"" Lebowski). Informed of their error, they leave. But Bridges is upset one left his rug soaked with urine. The rug really tied the room together. Now, it will stink. Bridges decides to ask the ""The Big Lebowski"" to pay damages...At the mansion, Bridges meets funny Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Brandt) and his namesake's busty blonde trophy wife Tara Reid (as Bunny). She offers oral services for $1,000, but Bridges is broke. Later, Bridges is employed to help retrieve the kidnapped wife by transporting $1,000,000 in ransom money. Helping Bridges are two bowling pals, chubbier John Goodman (as Walter) and talky Steve Buscemi (as Donny). There is more sex appeal in beautifully-figured Julianne Moore (as Maude).

Jeff Lebowski(Jeff Bridges)is a pot bellied, pot-smoking laid back slacker that insists on being called ""The Dude"". His two best friends are Walter(John Goodman), who sees the world against him for surviving the Viet Nam War; and Donny(Steve Buscemi), who manages to butt-in on conversations only to be ignored. Dude's world consists of bowling and getting stoned. Somehow Dude is mistaken for a wheel-chaired millionaire (David Huddleston)and is caught up in a kidnapping scam for the ransom. Dude seems more upset with getting restitution for his urine ruined rug. Dude of course needs the aid of his two foul-mouthed bowling friends. Also fitting into this amusing plot are: Julianne Moore as Maude the erotic artist; John Turturro as a hair-netted Latino bowler named Jesus and Tara Reid as sexpot Bunny Lebowski. Rounding out this diverse cast of characters are Philip Seymour Huffman, Ben Gazzara, Flea and Sam Elliott, who also narrates. The dialog seems glued together with the ""F"" word...which of course is a noun, verb and adjective. It seems one toke over the line is not enough. Cheers for the Coen brothers.",The Big Lebowski
18,sunwarrior13,Enormously Entertaining,10,23 October 2012,"The Big Lebowski is a comedy written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. Jeff Bridges stars as Jeff Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler, who is referred to as ""The Dude"". After a case of mistaken identity, The Dude is introduced to a millionaire also named Jeffrey Lebowski. When the millionaire Lebowski's trophy wife is later kidnapped, he commissions The Dude to deliver the ransom to secure her release. The plan goes awry when The Dude's friend Walter Sobchak schemes to keep the full ransom.John Goodman,Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, Julianne Moore, Tara Reid, and John Turturro co-star to play key supporting roles.It is loosely based on Raymond Chandler's novel, The Big Sleep.Typically stunning visuals and sharp dialogue from the Coen Brothers, brought to life with strong performances from Goodman and Bridges. After the tight plotting and quirky intensity of Fargo, this casually amusing follow-up from the prolifically inventive Coen brothers seems like a bit of a lark. The plot--which finds Lebowski involved in a kidnapping scheme after he's mistaken for a rich guy with the same name- -is almost beside the point. What counts here is a steady cascade of hilarious dialogue, great work from Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi, and the kind of cinematic ingenuity that puts the Coens in a class all their own. The result is a lot of laughs and a feeling of awe toward the craftsmanship involved.It was enormously entertaining.",The Big Lebowski
19,Hey_Sweden,This ol' movie really ties the collection together.,7,27 May 2020,"Jeff Bridges is perfect as Jeff Lebowski, a.k.a. The Dude; he's an ageing, amiable slacker who doesn't do much with his time besides bowl. When he's mistaken for a rich man (David Huddleston) with the same name, he's hired by the rich man to deliver a ransom. Things go from bad to worse in a hurry, in large part because The Dude frequently involves his loud, abrasive buddy Walter (John Goodman), a crazed Vietnam vet, in his actions.In terms of the overall Coen brothers filmography, this is relatively minor stuff. It goes on a little too long, and wasn't always terribly funny to this viewer. It also feels self-indulgent at times. And yet, Joel and Ethan here craft a twist-laden, elaborate story that does have some good moments, as well as a highly profane script and an eclectic soundtrack. (The Dude hates The Eagles, but is a big fan of CCR.) Its quotes certainly entered the public consciousness in a big way, with Bridges quickly becoming a pop culture icon in his role. ""Well, you know, that's just like your opinion, man.""The main reason it worked to any degree (at least for this viewer) was because of its impressive and well-chosen cast: Sam Elliott (as a friendly narrator), Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi (as in ""Shut the *beep* up, Donny!""), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Tara Reid, Peter Stormare, David Thewlis, Flea, Ben Gazzara, Jon Polito, etc. John Turturro is such a hoot as a bowler named Jesus that it's too bad that his screen time is so limited.""The Big Lebowski"" is a truly character-driven comedy that does wrap up in a typically amusing way, and it shows that its main character can't just be dismissed as a non-thinking deadbeat; he knows when he's been used. It gave this viewer a conclusion that earned an honest smile, as Elliott breaks the fourth wall and comments on the nature of the yarn with which he's regaled us.Seven out of 10.",The Big Lebowski

""Sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes, well, he eats you.""Some driving around in a comedy of errors where John Goodman really shines as Walter Sobchak. With friends like that, you certainly don't need enemies.

And when Steve Buscemi started talking about the In and Out Burger, I almost lost it. I swore he was going to go into ""the old in and out"" routine.A visit to Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) brings about an amazing thing that could only be described as an acid flashback. I have to admit I had my mouth open the whole time it was going on. It was just that incredible.You should get the idea that this is not a film about kidnapping and money and criminals; it was a film about the characters. i only touched on the main ones.

21,zardoz-13,A Coen Bros. Classic!,10,12 May 2011,"This masterpiece comedy from the Coen brothers with an unforgettable performance by Jeff Bridges as the Dude had an abysmal theatrical run, but it has generated a cult around it since it hit video. The Dude is the ultimate stoner, a slacker role model for the offbeat whose claim to fame is his superior skills as a bowler and the authorship of the Port Huron Statement. Whether Bridges likes it or not, he will always be a symbol of the rebellious counterculture. As his close friend Walter Sobchak, John Goodman is obnoxiously hilarious, whether he is whining about the buddies that he lost in Vietnam or his pseudo Jewish heritage, and John Turturro is just as outrageous as a weaselly sexual predator. The characters that make up ""The Big Lebowski"" qualify as a diverse group. The Coen brothers deal with the theme of mistaken identities and a supposed kidnapping. Two of Jackie Treehorn's moronic thugs attack the Dude (Jeff Bridges) at his modest Venice Beach bungalow and plunge his head repeatedly into a toilet in an effort to wring information out of him. At one point, one of the two urinates on the Dude's thrown rug. Eventually, one thug figures out that the Dude is poor rather than wealthy. As it turns out, they targeted the wrong Lebowski but meant to confront Pasadena philanthropist Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston of ""McQ"") whose young wife Bunny (Tara Reid) owes Treehorn a bundle of dough. The Dude is so upset by the act of aggression by Treehorn's thugs that he visits Lebowski and demands compensation for his rug. Although Lebowski refuses to compensate the Dude, the Dude steals a rug and falls under the scrutiny of Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore of ""The Forgotten"")who was sentimentally attached to the rug. She explains that she controls all of the money and doles out amounts to Jeffrey. Anyway, Jeffrey hires the Dude to serve as a go-between the kidnappers and Lebowski. Walter tries to tell the Dude how to handle this sticky situation, but everything that Walter does leads to something infinitely worse. At mid-point, Walter is seen running around his ex-wife's Pomeranian. Some of the funniest scenes involve idiotic Walter taking a tire-iron to a sports car that he thinks a little boy owns and another has a trio of German nihilists visiting the Dude's apartment and dumping a marmot in his bathtub while he is bathing.""The Big Lebowski"" winds up being an oddball Raymond Chandler-esque mystery with the Dude acting as a gumshoe. As usual, the Coens present a gallery of weirdo characters. Maude ranks as a really warped character who describes her experimental art as 'vaginal.'Sam Elliott is very good as the narrator known only as 'The Stranger' who introduces us to the Dude during an evocative opening title sequence with the Sons of the Pioneers crooning in the background.",The Big Lebowski

Incredibly funny, in an off-beat sort of way. Dialogue is insanely original, fresh and simply wonderful.The performances are spot-on. I can't imagine anyone other than Jeff Bridges playing The Dude.

23,Boba_Fett1138,Instant classic.,9,27 December 2010,"There are several things that can make a great comedy. You could, for instance, have some effectively planned and executed comical moments, a cleverly funny written script or some amusing characters that can make your movie. ""The Big Lebowski"" is however a movie that has this all in it.When watching a Coen brothers movies you always know that you are going to get something special and unique. Their comedy style and just overall way off film-making are very distinctive, which is not in the least also due to the fact hat besides directing and producing all of their movies, they also write and edit them themselves. So all of their movies are really being their movies, with some exaggerated characters, dark comedy and violence and lots of eye for detail with its filming, as well as with its writing.Thing that catches immediately the attention about this movie is how incredibly well written and layered the movie is. Just when you think that they can't possible throw in another story-line, with different new characters, they do and it also manages to work out well for the movie, which is all the more a great accomplishment. There is really a lot going on in this movie, even though its main character itself is extremely laid back and manages to get himself into trouble by basically doing nothing at all.Yes, the Dude makes this movie what it is and also makes it work out as well as it does. It's a great character, who basically seems like a left over product from the '70's and has made no attempt to adapt himself to the 'new' world or just normal society in general. He simply does his thing, which is bowling, driving around and having the occasional acid flashback. It's good that there are guys like him being around, who go against the flow and simply follow their own path. Not to be a rebel but just to simply do only the things he wants to and simply life his live without worrying about tomorrow or yesterday. Yes, Jeffrey 'The Dude' Lebowski has grown into an iconic character already, which of course is also thanks to Jeff Bridges performances of him.But the whole movie is being filled with some real great and memorable comedy characters. All of them are quite over-the-top, which suits the world the Coen brothers create with their movie. It really has a dream cast and what is it with John Goodman and the Coen brothers, who always seem to bring out the best from Goodman. John Goodman always seems at home within a Coen brothers movie, no matter what type of role he ever plays.The movie does not only handle its comedy extremely well, it's also simply technically a very well made movie. The directing is truly great and it uses all kinds of different techniques and tricks, which help to give the movie a very special, warm and amusing type of atmosphere.But yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, my opinion, man.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Big Lebowski

Hysterically funny comic noir salute to THE BIG SLEEP from masters of mirth and menace The Coen Brothers gives a wide brush on the genre with one of cinema's greatest characters ever on The Silver Screen, The Dude (Bridges in an unexpected iconic role having a blast and resembling/channeling Warner Bros. Looney Tune Pete Puma; seriously his facial qualities are uncanny), a leftover '60s hippie/radical/slacker who unwittingly is mistaken for the titular LA entrepreneur (Huddleston) in a wild-and-woolly kidnapping scheme by a pack of numbskulled nihilists. Fast and riotously funny and inimitably quotable (i.e. ""That rug really tied the room together"") with outstandingly out-there performances by Goodman as The Dude's main amigo and bowling partner Walter Sobchak (""I don't bowl on Shabbas""), Buscemi as their dim bud Donny (""You're out of your element Donny!""), Moore as an avante garde artiste, and Turturro as a 'pedarast' sporting foe.

I have fought this for quite some time, but must now give it up for the greatness that is ... the Coen Brothers. Bad pub made me stay away from Lebowski on its theatrical release, and am just now getting around to it.  What a gem! Truly brilliant casting and the Coen's now customary bizarre dialog make this one something special.  Who, but the Coens, would cast Steve Buscemi as a former surfer or Flea (Red Hot Chili Peppers) as a nihilist?  Yes, we expect perfection from Jeff Bridges every time - here he delivers.  Is he a slacker or just a decent guy who doesn't wish his rug soiled?  Bridges perfectly captures the spirit of the dude.  Goodman is his usual over-the-top self, only moreso.  His dialog seems at time pulled straight from ""Casino"", if you f** know what I f** mean.  The beautiful Julianne Moore seems a bit disinterested in her role until her wonderful scene for improving conception.  Philip Seymour Hoffman again shows why he is absolutely the best young character actor working today.  Tara Reid (""Cruel Intentions"" and ""American Pie"") has a brief yet effective role as teh trophy wife with confusing intentions.  David Huddleston steals his scenes for the first time since ""Blazing Saddles"" and Coen regular, John Turturro is terrifically offbeat as Jesus the wonder bowler.  Sam Elliot lends a touch of class as the stranger, and don't miss Aimee Mann ('til Tuesday) and Ben Gazarra.  Another aspect that we have come to expect in Coen movies is a wonderful soundtrack.  Lebowski provides us with Dylan and Costello along with the wonderful work of Carter Burwell. This movie begs for repeat viewings, but do brace yourself for the boundary pushing.",The Big Lebowski

Get a load of this thing: it's a mystery yarn set against the backdrop of a bowling tournament, with more F-words than a whorehouse, a host of whacked-out characters and the protagonists are a stoner and his crazy Vietnam veteran buddy. It's also one of the most quotable movies ever produced. The magic is in the dialogue.But it's one of my all-time favorite movies because of the two leads. John Goodman seems to exist solely to keep Jeff Bridges in a state of perpetual exasperation, and their bickering never fails to send me into a fit of giggles.Also, if I can get Sam Elliott to narrate my life story, I'd call that a big bucket of win.10/10",The Big Lebowski

So when The Big Lebowski came out I'm sure they were all over this film. The film is in no way bad, but it's definitely a movie that isn't for everyone. Besides the strange characters, the plot is equally as weird and is a little hard to elaborate. But really, the film is one to laugh out loud too. Both leads in this film are portrayed fantastically and are very funny when on screen alone and simultaneously. Bridges' character ""The Dude"" is one of the best characters in any Coen Brothers film.When it comes to Jeff Bridges, I don't know a lot. I do like him for his underrated role he played in K-PAX, but this is only, I believe, the second film I've seen with him. He's great at doing a Comedy film. When he gets into character with the LA slacker accent he can be a thrill to watch. He drops some funny one liners in this picture and is also accompanied greatly by John Goodman who plays Walter. When the duo appear on screen the laughs keep coming and coming and the humor rarely lets up.The plot involves an unmotivated slacker nicknamed ""The Dude"" (Bridges) demands Jeffrey Lebowski (The Big Lebowski) to give him a new rug after his was urinated on by two robbers who were looking for a person by the same name as ""The Dude's"" (Jeffrey Lebowski). His request is declined but he is contacted again when Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped and after a series of events The Dude and Walter must return the ransom in order to get the wife back.The Big Lebowski isn't really my type of film. The Coen Brothers never were my type either. I was never really into their films and am into a much more different tone of Comedy. This Comedy, while being well done and funny, is also a little bit of annoying too because of how long it is. The movie could be trimmed around maybe twenty minutes in my opinion. It doesn't need to span close to two hours. Sort of reminds me of Dinner for Schmucks how it almost runs two hours to say that since it's long it's better. Not true for any movie.One of TBL's high points are the character performances by John Goodman and Jeff Bridges. Both characters are insanely funny and very amusing to watch on screen as well. I am really fond of ""The Dude"" character and he throws in very amusing and clicking lines in the films as well. I enjoyed the end scene and the way the movie ended too. I guess what I'm trying to say is that The Big Lebowski has ups and downs, but really, it's a movie you need to try out. It may not be for everyone, but it does have it's share of humor.The last thing I need to say is this is a film I don't think I'd watch again. Various films I've reviewed recently I've went back to and rewatched again for the hell of it and some movies I even watch for an occasional third time. Naked Fear I've watched once more since I reviewed it and I gave Eve's Beach Fantasy another try and couldn't make it through the first ten minutes. I don't know if I can watch this film again just for the hell of it because I believe I got the full entertainment value the first time around. While it's well made, I'm sure I'll come back to it in later years, but not anytime soon, but clips I can assure you will be revisited. The Big Lebowski is a highly enjoyable film. While not being what I expected, it still had a great cast and various scenes with lots of humor. I think I can say, it certainly does abide.Starring: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Julianne Moore. Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen.",The Big Lebowski

Some ultimatum, huh? Well, I did watch it immediately.The Big Lebowski over all was a funny film. I had more than a few good laughs.

The two friends are a crazed Vietnam war veteran(John Goodman) and a lonely loser(Steve Buscemi). All of sudden this trio of bowling buddies will find themselves on an unexpected journey of facing crazy characters and being involved in an apparent kidnapping case that's tied to mistaken identity.So clearly this is a wild goose chase type of film that's unique as some of the scenes are strikingly visual and it's plot keeps you thinking also look for good supporting turns from Juilanne Moore and Phillp Seymour Hoffman. This is a film that will appeal mostly to the hippie culture and older people still it has plenty of laughs and it's creative enough to last in memory as a unique cult art cinema classic. So remember Dude ""The Big Lebowski"" is an offbeat film that strikes a unique score any film watcher will find it's plot very creative that's blended well with laughs! And the acting was in fine form as the chemistry of the characters made the film work so clearly this is an underrated classic to remember.",The Big Lebowski
37,MovieAddict2016,It has its flaws but it is also extremely entertaining and one of the Coen Brothers' best films.,10,12 April 2004,"If you were a fan of ""Fargo,"" you might just like ""The Big Lebowski,"" a bizarre comedy whose hero (if that is the appropriate word) is played by Jeff Bridges as a spaced-out junkie who lives in Los Angeles, unemployed, with a trashy apartment and few belongings. His name is Lebowski, but he is known by his friends as The Dude, and he prefers that moniker rather than his birth name.Every evening Dude goes bowling with his best buddies, Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi). Walter is a Vietnam veteran, and in his perception, all incidents relate to the war. ""What does the Vietnam War have to do with anything?"" Dude asks him at a fragile moment in both their lives. Instead of disputing, Walter gives him a big bear hug.The story begins with a humorous and self-aware voice-over by the narrator, played by Sam Elliot in a few recurring cameos. He informs us that Dude's adventure started on an eventful night not very long ago, when a duo of criminals broke into his house in search of The Big Lebowski, a local millionaire who happens to share Dude's last name. After dunking Dude's face into a toilet bowl and realizing that they've attacked the incorrect individual, the pair of idiots urinate on Dude's rug and flee the apartment.Dude figures that the only man truly responsible for the incident is Lebowski himself, so he makes a trip out to his mansion and is informed by Lebowski's assistant (portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman with the perfect amount of nervousness) that Lebowski's wife has been kidnapped and is being held for ransom. Suspecting that she is in the custody of the two men who attacked Dude, Lebowski offers the slacker a chance to be the courier of his ransom fee. ""Her life is in your hands,"" Lebowski tells him. He promises him some cash to transport a briefcase containing the money, and Lebowski agrees to help him out.Unfortunately, the kidnappers never receive their ransom, and Dude's car is stolen, along with Lebowski's money. It just so happens that Lebowski's unfaithful wife owed some money to a trio of German nihilists, as well as an adult filmmaker and an assortment of other odd creatures, and now Lebowski is being targeted for the cash. Everyone seems to think that the briefcase is in his possession, and he is threatened that he will lose his ""Johnson"" unless it is returned. Fearing for his life (and more importantly, his Johnson) Dude takes comfort in Walter, who tracks down the 15-year-old teenager who stole the car and the briefcase and has apparently bought a sports car with a small portion of the briefcase's contents. ""See this Tommy? This is what happens when you mess with a stranger!"" Walter yells at the boy as he single-handedly demolishes the sports car. We all anticipate the obvious punch line far ahead of time, but the result is nevertheless extremely funny.The Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, are extremely gifted filmmakers. They burst onto screens across the nation in 1984 with their indie classic ""Blood Simple,"" which starred Frances McDormand and Dan Hedaya, the former of whom would later star in ""Fargo"" as the bumbling police officer Marge Gunderson.As usual, the Coens fall back on their quirky characters for comic relief and enjoyable antics, particularly Buscemi, who is one of the best character actors in Hollywood, and who also manages to be funny in whichever role he chooses - despite having to say anything funny at all. In ""Fargo"" he was the blundering kidnapper, Carl, and in ""The Big Lebowski,"" he lets his hair part across his head and hang low across his face, completely changing his entire pattern of speech. He's the goofy little squirt who tags along with Dude and Walter, and manages to repeat everything they say and ask questions about discussions long after they have ended. ""You're like a child who has wandered into the middle of a movie and wants to know what's going on!"" Walter tells him. ""What's your point, Walter?"" he asks. But it's the innocent nature of his tone that leads us to like him, and it's Walter's crazy antics that makes us feel attached to him, and it's The Dude's trademark humor that makes us enjoy watching him. The Coens have succeeded at making a great comedy with characters that actually have their own characteristics. But it is the Coens' eloquent use of proverbial language that is really what elevates the film above all else. The script is wonderful and witty. This has some of the best dialogue I have ever heard, ranking up there with ""Pulp Fiction"" and the work of Elmore Leonard. Walter's rants consume much of the dialogue, which I think is fine.""The Big Lebowski"" is a movie with considerably large structural flaws and weaknesses. Yet the film seems to know this, letting the audience in on the secret during the introductory voice-over narration. ""Aw, I've lost my train of thought,"" we're told, as The Stranger mumbles on about the movie's plot. And towards the end, we're all told by The Stranger that he sincerely hopes we enjoyed the story, even if it's nothing special. Yup, that about sums it all up. ""The Big Lebowski"" is a movie with a lot of joy, wit, and wicked humor: three reasons you've got to see one of the most enjoyable films of the past decade.",The Big Lebowski
38,Red-Barracuda,Pretty pointless but funny at times,7,23 April 2012,"A stoner called The Dude is mistaken for a millionaire who shares his name, the big Lebowski. This rich man's wife owes cash to a goon. She is subsequently kidnapped and the big Lebowski assigns The Dude the task of being the bag man in return for a load of money. The mission is screwed up, however, when The Dude's friend Walter joins in and messes things up. This leaves The Dude in a shaky position where he has to attempt to reclaim the money.This is a defiantly pointless film. It's a crime-comedy with very little emphasis on realism. It's played for laughs pure and simple. It benefits from an impressive cast. Jeff Bridges is good in the lead role, with some funny support performances from John Turturro as a sleazy bowler and Philip Seymour-Hoffman as the big Lebowski's personal assistant. Although I found John Goodman a little overbearing and annoying to tell you the truth. It's a highly stylised film, which you would probably expect coming from the Coen brothers. It isn't always as funny as it thinks it is though, although there are admittedly a number of very funny moments. It was nice to hear some good sounds in this one though. In particular a couple of ultra-cool laid back tunes from early 70's Italian movies, namely Piacere Sequence by Teo Usuelli (taken from the giallo 'Amuck') and Traffic Boom by Piero Piccioni (taken from the comedy 'All Screwed Up') - the latter of which was the soundtrack to the film within a film here.Its story-line is very unfocused, maybe that's the point I suppose but it certainly means that in order to enjoy the film you need to be able to overlook this. It's surely no coincidence that lots of people say they weren't too keen on this film the first time they saw it and it took subsequent viewings to appreciate. I myself am pretty much the same and this no doubt explains its lukewarm performance at the box office and then it's slow-burning success on home video. Having said all this, despite being an entertaining film, I still find it kind of hard to understand the real appeal of this movie. An amusing enough flick for sure but not a grade A Coen movie in my opinion.",The Big Lebowski
39,KineticSeoul,One of my favorite Coen brothers film,9,29 April 2013,"This is one of my favorite Coen brothers film and thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish. It's a black comedy with humor that is clever and really works and will grab your amusement till it's over. And even when it's over I couldn't help but think about certain scenes in this movie because of the memorable characters. It's a brash comedy but all the elements work well together in this. Because of this film Jeff Bridges will forever be known as The Dude. The Dude is this really mellow and laid back guy who isn't that bright or ambitious of a person. In fact he is unemployed and lazy while drinking White Russian but I couldn't help but like the guy. Also how he deals with his surrounding and his ""what the heck"" expressions is just priceless. He sort of reminded me of Homer Simpson from ""The Simpsons"". And adds a lot of humor to this film. The story is basically about a Dude that gets tangled up in a situation because of a certain coincidence and becomes sort of a kidnapping investigation and the people around him constantly makes the situation worse for the guy. This is a very humorous comedy with quite a bit of satire that works. And has bunch of scenarios that interconnect very well near the end. John Goodman is also in this film and The Dude's best friend...Well only friend. And he plays this obnoxious loose-cannon type of character and he will probably forever be known for his role in this as well. Overall if you like Coen brothers film or even a great humorous film make sure to check this one out. I wanted to get myself a White Russian drink after this film.9.5/10",The Big Lebowski
40,thesar-2,Lebowski Gets Bigger With Every Viewing,9,5 February 2011,"God, I don't even know where to start with The Big Lebowski. Perhaps at the beginning?My (then) boyfriend practically forced me in 2002-3 to watch this against my will – holding me down, as he was bigger and stronger, while propping my eyes open, a la Clockwork Orange. Okay, fine, he suggested it, I hesitated and gave inis how it really went down. At any rate, I only mildly liked it then when he was rolling with his signature and usually contagious laughter.The movie grew on me, however, over the years – and that's not with extra viewings. In fact, until last night, 2/4/2011, I hadn't seen it since. I have thought about this feature, discussed with others and found myself laughing at scenes and dialogue that I hadn't seen or heard in years. Damn, I'm glad I decided to finally revisit it in order to finally review it.The movie was enormously well written and original. Hilarious, spot on and had some of the best deliveries. When I tried to find the ONE scene I loved the most or the ONE line I favored above the rest, it was incredibly difficult. I ended up picking the sex/bowling dream even though all scenes with the ""Caucasian"" (or White Russian) in his hand, especially when he should've spilled it, but didn't, had me cracking up. And the lines throughout were clever, ingenious and memorable/quotable, but to narrow it down, I simply picked the ""Shut the f*ck up, Donny!"" line that's repeated many times. Each time I heard that, even the 15th, made me laugh out loud.But, the movie's strength wasn't just in the comedy. It's incredibly creative and has a novel approach to the old mistaken identity plot. Throw in great cinematography, convincing twists and wonderful acting and you have a near-perfect film and probably my favorite Coen Brothers feature.Further, the characters really drove the film even above and beyond what was already mentioned. Most were excellent and original, but Jeff Bridges actually should have received his first (of many deserved) Oscar for his role as ""The Dude."" The uniqueness, depth and believability alongside Bridges' own spin and acting made The Dude one of my all time favorite characters in films.Caucasian drinking, robe-wearing, unemployed and lazy-ass The Dude struts through life while bowling with his wacked ex-'Nam buddy, Walter (Goodman) and Donny (Buscemi) untilone day he's mistaken for wealthy Jeffrey Lebowski (Huddleston) who shares the same name as The Dude's real name.There's been a kidnapping of the appropriately named ""Bunny"" (Reid), the wife of ""The Big(ger) Lebowski,"" for a million bucks and The Dude, as sluggish as he is, pays as close attention to this as would a pet gerbil to its surroundings. But, one of the bad men pee on his rug that sets off a chain of unfortunate events that get The Dude and Walter into trouble as they investigate and try and disfuse the situation sothey can get back to their bowling league.More clues and kookier characters blend into the mix and the Coen Brothers don't even miss a beat in making this unbelievably realistic. Example: Jesus, (Turturro) and yes, you pronounce it as the same Man on the cross, wanders in and out of the movie setting up a hilarious but completely irrelevant character. That's how it is in the real world.Sure, the movie actually goes on for a little longer than it should – the movie's only real flaw, but it's worth the entire trip (yeah, literal trip.) Also, there's a hell of a lot of swearing. I kinda matched that in my review, which is something I normally don't do, but here, it's relevant.The Big Lebowski is a prime example of how to make a movie. And quite frankly, this movie can be broken down and studied. For, line by line, it's pure craftsmanship.",The Big Lebowski
41,FeastMode,my notes,2,26 June 2019,I didn't think it was funny. It was occasionally interesting but I was mostly bored and almost didn't finish it (1 viewing),The Big Lebowski
42,ElMaruecan82,"The Fun, Bearable Lightness of Bowling...",10,8 September 2016,"As guys, we've all been through this Bohemian times, where we could keep the same underwear for the week, and bed sheets for the month, when the toilet seat could be left open and we could do whatever we wanted in the bathtub without a nagging female voice interrupting our meditation. But now that we settled down, it's with nostalgic eyes that we remember the time we could be guys in the lousiest and laziest meaning of the world, and venerate the one who made this attitude a lifestyle, a state of mind, a philosophy. His name is Jeff Lebowksy aka the Dude, a name fittingly rhyming with attitude, and he's played by the namesake Bridges in the signature role his career much needed.Indeed, who needs motives, personal backgrounds, goals and all that screen writing hogwash when you have an attitude. The attitude makes the characters who make the film, and that's the way the Coen brothers have it with ""The Big Lebowski"", bizarrely overlooked at the time of its release, but whose brilliance blossomed in our minds after we got rid of all our preconceived cinematic notions and started to appreciate the laziest character of L.A. But while the Californian urban landscape is integral to the film's 'narrative', I think every man in a way or another can relate to the Dude, starting with his appearance. Basically, he looks like a bum, with his long leonine hair, his shaggy goatee, his Bermudas shorts, flip-flops and bathrobes, but here's a guy who (obviously) is the antithesis of the metro-sexual figure, and that's enough a reason to love him.What matters for the Dude is to go bowling with his team: Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi) and enjoying a White Russian cocktail. Walter is a Nam vet and the kind of friends that make you wish for enemies, and Donnie is the space filler who can't align three sentences before being told to 'shut the **** up"". You think it's crazy to hang out with such guys? I have a friend like Walter, and no matter how much of a bastard he could be, we 'forgot about it' while playing pool. Bowling, pool or poker, the point is that if guys were given the opportunity, they would pick fun and idleness as ways of life. And if it was up to the Dude, there would be no plot, two guys could beat and water-board him, he'd let them go the minute they knew it was the wrong Lebowski, but one committed a mistake, he peed on the rug, the one that ""tied the room together"".The film is set during the Gulf War, so when he shares his misadventure, Walter paraphrases Bush Sr. and tells the Dude that they crossed the line and he's entitled to demand reparation. If the Dude is the extreme of men's capability to live without rules, Walter is the total opposite and can't envision life without a sense of ethos. He can't play on the Shabbat day even though he's not Jewish, but like he says, just because he divorced from his Jewish wife doesn't mean he should give back the library card. Walter is so wrapped up in his self-righteousness (he point a gun on a player who can't admit he crossed the line) that he's the one who makes the plot move forward, much to the Dude's annoyance. Goodman is the Laurel to Bridges' Hardy and you can't count how many times the Dude realizes the nice mess, he's been gotten into. And the mess all starts with the 'rug' situation.So, the Dude complains to the Big Lebowski (the late David Huddleston) a tycoon who incarnates the American capitalist dream, and except for his legs, lost in Korea, he has everything: money, power, influence a philanthropic foundation and Bunny, a trophy wife played by Tara Reid. The Big Lebowski throws the 'little' one out of his office, but the Dude tells his spineless assistant (played by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman) that his boss agreed to leave him a rug as compensation. And as far as he was concerned, all was well that ended well for the Dude, and he could focus on the next game with Jesus Quintana, a Hispanic Bowling champ played by the Coen regular Tarantino. Quintana makes quite an impression when he's introduced but the feeling is immediately (and hilariously) contradicted by the little back-story detail Walter provides.But we won't have much of Quintana, because there's more going plot=wise, Bunny is kidnapped, his worried husband hires the Dude as a negotiator, and Maude Lebowski, his daughter (Julianne Moore) takes the rug back (and many other things I wouldn't spoil) . Many critics point out the fact that there's not a real plot, and it doesn't matter, even the narrator (mustached legend Sam Elliott reckoned he's lost his train of thoughts) but I think there's one identifiable pattern in the Big Lebowski, the characters have an attitude, which means, they believe in something tangible. The Dude believed in bowling, Walter in bowling and ethos, Donnie in his friends, the Big Lebowski in principles, his assistant in the Big Lebowski so it's all natural that the closest to villains in the film would be nihilists. It's one thing to do nothing but being driven by nothing is beyond reason.And for all the mess, the Dude and Walter go through, they remains true to their nature and this contrast makes their interaction and situations so damn hilarious, I understand the film needed some musical interludes to let us catch our breath, one of them providing an unforgettable POV shot from within a rolling bowling ball. When knocked up, the Dude only cares for bowling, more than a game, a defining metaphor for the man who slowly rolls over the lane of life. The film also ends on a pure metaphor, because, in bowling terms, ""The Big Lebowski"" is a strike!",The Big Lebowski
43,paul2001sw-1,Funny peculiar,6,17 April 2004,"'The Big Lebowski' tells an enjoyable shaggy dog tale with Jeff Bridges playing the shaggy dog - slacker dude Lebowski, who gets bizarrely caught up in a kidnapping scam.  There are lots of laugh out load moments, but this is a very peculiar film, varying between downbeat black comedy and pure stand-up, interlaced with self-knowing references to numerous different styles of movie making and peppered with a pointlessly astonishing expletive count.The Coen brothers are very clever, but sincerity is never their strong point, and, although it pains me to diss any film with Townes van Zandt on the soundtrack, the net result is rather unaffecting. And it's not that I don't like weird movies; but 'The Big Lebowski' (in defiance of its hero's philosophy) seems to try just a little too hard.",The Big Lebowski

By the end of the film, I had to change my judgement. I did have a good time, but I was disappointed that I did not love this. There are some fun, quirky moments but this movie was too strange for my taste.This is about a guy named ""The Dude"" who is trying to investigate a case of his missing carpet and missing money.Jeff Bridges is a great actor, but I he was a little annoying in the movie as ""The Dude."" However, John Goodman had a classic performance as The Dude's best friend.Overall, this is a decent at best film. It has some funny moments but not enough to justify the high rating this film got.

45,ericstevenson,"""Got anymore of that good sarsaparilla?""",10,20 April 2018,"I'm going to say that this is the best movie I've reviewed for Channel Awesome Month. It's constantly referenced by the Nostalgia Critic obviously and a ton of other people. What makes this movie so great is that there's so much going on and yet in the end it's mostly pointless. Actually, it's worse than that. Things are probably worse off now that Donnie is dead and he even dies from something that isn't even related to the main conflict of the story. But you know what? We had a great time while it was going on. Movies like ""Monty Python And The Holy Grail"" are ultimately pointless, but that doesn't mean we're not entertained like mad while the movie was going. This movie tells the story of a guy named Lebowski or ""The Dude"" who meets a rich guy also called Lebowski. He's the Big Lebowski and he wants the Dude to rescue his wife. I didn't even realize Philip Seymour Hoffman was in this movie. We have such a fantastic cast with Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Julianne Moore. This is one of the most profane movies ever made with 260 f-words (although I only counted 258, I knew I lost my count a few times). They even manage to play with that. There are many four minute segments that feature no swearing at all to emphasis the more dramatic tone here. I guess it's ironic that the most beloved sports movie of all time happens to be one about bowling, not much of a competitive sport. It's truly heartwarming when The Stranger talks to us at the very end. He says that even though things were mostly bad for the dude, at least he can keep a positive attitude and if nothing else, live the life he wants to. Yeah, this is Steve Buscemi's best movie (I recently saw ""Reservoir Dogs"") and John Goodman's best too. ****",The Big Lebowski
46,lesleyharris30,"Strange, Funny and Stronge Performances,",8,12 April 2015,"The Big Lebowski is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast. With it's very goofy set up and even its characters, you wouldn't expect very big performances from the cast, but they all deliver superb acting, they were all taking a huge risk with this very unusual film, and they ended up making a good choice. My favourite scenes are definitely any one between Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, the chemistry between the two of them is terrific, they both play very unique characters, nothing like any of their previous roles. It's definitely longer than it needs to be, it's nearly too hours long, and with the story being as ridiculous as it is, this can get a little bit tiring after a while, but it is mostly entertaining and hilarious throughout. Very different and packs in plenty of laughs, I would recommend the Big Lebowski to anyone looking for a good comedy. A man must cope with being mistaken from a millionaire who owes a lot of money, and receives the help of his bowling buddies to seek revenge. Best Performance: Jeff Bridges Worst Performance: Tara Reid",The Big Lebowski
47,CuriosityKilledShawn,"You see what happens, Larry?",6,25 September 1998,"It's hard to pick out one line of dialogue in particular for two reasons. One-almost everything said in this film is downright hilarious. And Two-the F word is spoken 281 times so there's not many sentences that don't contain it. 144 sentences also end in 'man'.Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence. He has no job, no ambitions and no worries. His days, be they weekdays or weekends, are spent bowling, driving around or having the occasional acid flashback. His pals are Walter Sobchak, a security expert and half-crazed Vietnam vet and Donny, a humble, mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversation.The Dude is happy with his easy-going life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the OTHER Jeff 'The Big' Lebowski, the millionaire with a trouble-making wife who owes money all over town. These thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and re-assert themselves by peeing on The Dude's rug.This very much displeases The Dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the 'Chinaman' thug responsible he decides to take it out of the Big Lebowski, as it's now HIM who owes a new rug. The Dude is welcomed into the Big Lebowski's mansion by Brandt the butler, a man so appallingly sycophantic he'd make Weylon Smither's look bad. But his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give hand-outs and basically tells The Dude to get lost.At this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of ex-pop star Nihilist thugs, a powerful pornographer, a dejected feminist daughter, a Brother Seamus (NOT an Irish Monk), a joyriding teenager, a revolting pederast champion bowler, Saddam Hussein, a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make The Dude's life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting. The plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA, going from limo to limo, never too far from a white Russian or a doobie.There are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it. Every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that, like me, you'll be acting the film out for years. Even on a 100th viewing you'll notice dramatic ironies, character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head before.The acting is superb. I am a fan of Jeff Bridges but he completely disappears in this film. He truly BECOMES The Dude and shows little of his recognisable self. John Goodman, in probably the most under-rated role of his career, is the world's angriest man. Bringing frustration and smart-ass arrogance to every scene (though he's almost always right). Set well over a decade after 'nam (and during the first Gulf conflict) Walter seems to be suffering from perpetual, ever-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation. Take a look at his 'minor' confrontation with Smokey for example.It's not about plot, or even characters. It's about a certain moment in time, the early 90s. And the definitive man of that time was the Dude. The rug-peeing just happened to occur simultaneously.",The Big Lebowski

50,ironhorse_iv,A dude's dude movie. Nearly a perfect comedy. The Dude abides,9,15 June 2013,"I love this movie so much. Anybody who doesn't like it, must be name Donny. Why? Because he must be out of his element. So shut up, Donny. It felt like a live, free-flowing work of comedy, action, and mystery. The Big Lebowski is an American classic that defied initial critical and box office failure to become a treasure of a film. This is one of the Coen's brothers most cleverly devised and executed stories. The plot surrounds the story about 'the laziest man in Los Angeles County' unemployed loser Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) who get mistaken for philanthropic millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski (David Huddleston) by henchman hired by pornographer gangster Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara). The Dude is a fairly good character, with White Russia in hand every time. You will hear that name a lot, about 161 times in the movie. They rough him up, and urine on his rug before last threaten to kill the millionaire's sexy young wife Bunny (Tara Reid) who the Dude has no clue of. With his bowling buddies, security-store owner and suppose Vietnam Vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and mild-mannered ex-surfer Donny (Steve Buscemi) take a Raymond Chandler like journey into the world of crime, violence, sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll to find another rug. This movie has a world of its own, there is nothing I can think of comparing it to and it was a great experience and I still enjoy watching it. Donnie, Walter and The Dude were made for Buscemi, Goodman and Bridges. The supporting cast is great as well. I like Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt, Peter Stormare as Karl Hungus and last John Turturro as Jesus. They all had memorable scenes and many unforgettable quotes. The character Jesus' potential was totally wasted in my opinion as he didn't serve anything to the plot. Lots of profanity-laced, repetitive tirades masquerading as hilarious dialogue that was a hit or a miss for some viewers. I got the humor, but for some people, they might see this as dumb. The editing needs some work as there is a lot of continuity problems, some crew visible, and a few audio/visual unsynchronized. Talking about audio. There's a soundtrack worth checking out. I love the Spanish flamenco version of The Eagles's Hotel California. It was awesome. Another song worth checking is Just Dropped In by Kenny Rodgers drifts through an elaborate bowling fantasy sequence titled Gutterballs. Nearly all of the visible symbols in The Dude's second dream sequence are taken from earlier scenes. While it's pretty good scene, it was kinda out of place. It was pretty pointless. Was I the only one totally lost when this scene played the first time watching it? There's something incredibly philosophical about the appearances of Saddam Hussein and the Gulf War in this movie. They're like an antithesis to the Dude. While the dude signifies the spirit of peace and and calm in the movie, Saddam symbolizes violence and war by being one of the greatest villains of the second half of the 20th century. The movie is often use for use as social and political analysis of many topics such as carnivalesque of modern society, commodity fetishism, neoconservatism etc. etc. In my opinion, while it does talk about major topic, it never does finish or make sense in the end of the film. There isn't a complex climax to the film. Sam Elliot appears at the conclusion to spout some bewildering nonsense that's meant to tack an explanation onto the end. Deep, I guess. So that might disappoint some people. What is it all really about? Who knows, let's just go bowling. Time heals all critical misconceptions, I guess as the movie fail when it came out, but grew into a cult following. This movie is like a good rug. Really tied the room together when looking at it.",The Big Lebowski
51,nairtejas,Powerful Characters Fooling Around. ♦ 65%,7,19 July 2013,"John Goodman's character impressed me more than the Dude did. Because he is funnier & deep.Following the story of how a slacker and his bowling club friends fall into a parade of crime is written with humor in mind. The characters are very different & genuine from each other. The boldness is another thing to consider. Great music playing as the background score, there are few moments when it comes to total laugh out. The thought of these sequences will make you laugh. Improbable situations deliberately brought out by the characters will feed you with story, narration & food for thought.Lengthening the plot a bit and shut-up ending makes me feel not totally satisfied by the dude & his chums. I'll rate a humble 6.5/10 for the gang and the eclectic characters, music & setups. Very impressed as this is my first film by Coen Brothers. Steve Buscemi is good while Jeff Bridges is cool as hell.BOTTOM LINE: Extremely funny for people who can relate. Moderately funny for people who enjoy logical scripts.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

52,The-Sarkologist,A Tale of The Dude,9,3 May 2020,"Well, one can certainly expect the Coen brothers to make a film that is different from the norm. The Big Lebowski is certainly one of those films, and it is a pretty good one at that. The film is based upon The Big Sleep, a gritty detective novel by Raymond Chandler, but there are certainly quite a lot of differences, and much of that happens to do with the Coen brother's unique style of film making.The film is about this guy known as 'The Dude', though his last name is Lebowski. One evening, when he returns home, he encounters a couple of home invaders that want him to pay them the money that his wife owes. The problem is that he isn't married, and he certainly doesn't have any money. They soil his rug and leave after realising that they have got the wrong Lebowski.So, the Dude suddenly finds himself caught up in this mystery, except that he isn't a detective, he is just this lazy, weed smoking, white Russian drinking guy that spends most of his time down at the bowling alley. Further, he just ends up getting caught up in this thing, were we have a millionaire with a trophy wife, except that the wife has been kidnapped, and he is asked to go and drop off the money.However, there are so many twists and turns in this film, that it ends up being one of those rather wild rides. If you are familiar with The Big Sleep, you will begin to pick up a lot of elements from that book, though the story is nowhere near as close - they tend to only loosely base their films on these ideas. Yet it is pretty gripping, and there is hardly a point where you aren't riveted to this film - that is the nature of the Coen brothers.Another thing that stands out is the characteristation, particularly since you sort of wonder why the Dude hangs around with the people that he does. In another way, the characters are also larger than life, though one could actually say that this isn't quite the case because while many of them are quite quirky, it is these quirks that actually make them much more realistic, and much more enjoyable to watch as well.The ending is, also, rather typical of the Coen brothers, namely because while it ends well, it isn't a happy ending where everybody ends up in a much better position than they originally were. Once again, this is a trait of the Coen brothers, to create a gritty film that while it doesn't seem to go anyway, or at least end well, it ends in a way that is quite satisfying. This is definitely a film to watch if you happen to like their style.",The Big Lebowski

The overall story, however, is a bit of a mess.",The Big Lebowski
55,Dr_Coulardeau,White Russian laced with hash and horse,9,23 August 2007,"This is nothing but a remake, or maybe the original (I would know if I had checked the dates: but you know, laziness, and it is funny to remain fuzzy, like the Coen Brothers themselves) of what we know under the title of ""Pulp Fiction"". The Coen Brothers get rid of the shuffling time line and have episodes and chapters in order, but it is just as intricate as the other, except that it is harmless, more or less, and funny in the punk beatnik post 1968 style if you like that and the unemployed who play the Greek philosophers.. It means that the mistake in ""Pulp Fiction"" becomes the rule here and everything is over-reacting and mis-targeting the true victim of the explosion, of temper of course, never of any fire-arms, though quite a few are moving and travelling around, just like bowling pins and bowling balls. That's a way of looking at suburban social sprawl that deserves some attention and time. The best debunking of pulp fiction is in the bar-diner scene. A lot of noise and ruckus for very little. I like the breaking in, out and through of all sorts of cars. The Coen Brothers don't seem to like cars probably because they are the best representation of American wastefulness and extreme vain arrogance. But ""Pulp Fiction"" seems to debunk cars too though in a different way.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",The Big Lebowski

Described and given a breakthrough performance from leads Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, as well as sharp directing from the Coen brothers. The film is a comedy in nature but a lot of it isn't as funny as described. There are some decent moments and some comedy comes from the chemistry of the characters but overall, not many laughs. As the dialogue is filled with a heavy amount of constant F-bombs, it becomes cluttered, also with much of The Dude's dialogue's consisting of ""dude"" or ""man"". We do get used to it but it becomes annoying. The storyline is there but as watching the film, there felt as if something was quite missing as it was not as great as originally thought upon.

Maybe it would work better if you watched it when you were stoned.This film has an amazing IMDb rating of 8.1. Everyone liked it, even the top thousand reviewers who rarely like any movie.

63,SAMTHEBESTEST,"Already a mess, which could have been told decently but this is very feeble..",5,7 May 2020,"The Big Lebowski (1998) :
Brief Review -Already a mess, which could have been told decently but this is very feeble. Crime comedy is one genre i always hated because comedy is something which doesn't belong to crime scenes unless it is a Black comedy. The Big Lebowski is a mess that couldn't have been handled any way but dipping in into comedy made it impuissant. There must be some reasons that this film has 8.1/10 rating on IMDb with approx 699k votes but i couldn't find one reason in the film. The story of a so called 'Dude' but a dead head who is mistaken as a millionaire gets involved in a kidnapping conspiracy and manages to acknowledge the whole mess. There isn't any thrill, nor any suspense. All you got is vulgar and abusive dialogues to entertain you in the form of comedy, and nothing else. Everything runs like a mess in the screen while you keep looking for one sensible thing to happen but at last all you get is disappointment. This adds more to that the actors in the film too behave irresponsibly while facing camera and you can easily notice thier dialogue delivery is a complete, big fumble. I rather like to laugh on jokers than these insensible artists. I just didn't understand what Joel Coen and Ethan Coel wanted to say? Were they trying to make me laugh with abusive jokes or were they trying to thrill me with funny laughable suspense? This whole thing is a MESS. A mess that cannot be justified or systemised at all. Forget watching it again, i already wasted my 2 hours in first watch.RATING - 5/10*By - #samthebestest",The Big Lebowski

You know it's not at the level of ""The Godfather"" but it has this ""special something"" that I can't describe.Ahhh, these Cohen Brothers. You gotta love their style. ""The Big Lebowski"" is the perfect 90's film that capitalizes all the distinctive elements of the aforementioned decade. Cultural change, not conventional characters, and the strangest situations that could happen to any Average Joe.The Dude is a character fell from Heaven. We all have a little of him inside. His random way of living and dialogs make him a very interesting character that defines that in the 90's many persons were ""peculiar"".James Woods delivers a hilarious performance. The man is out of his mind. The ""anti-semite"" oriented dialogs were very, very funny.I can't praise this movie enough because it never gets old. I can watch it any time of the year and it feels fresh. It's not a comedy but it's not a drama, it surely isn't pretentious.

65,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Yes, it is possible for ridiculous humor to be meaningful",9,24 February 2008,"Some scenes are a bit too absurd, preposterous, but ""The Big Lebowski"" abides. That being so, the Coen brothers simply say to their critics, ""such is life.""Their film is about exactly that - the absurdity of life in that no matter how much we try and take things into our own hands, do justice or make people claim responsibility for their actions, that life will often sucker-punch us out of left field.""Lebowski"" is about a man of that name that goes by ""The Dude."" He's a completely miserable, low-life character played by Jeff Bridges that for some reason you care about. As the Coen brothers are notorious for, The Dude gets caught up with some bad people for no reason other than he shares the same exact name as someone who happens to have money. When two guys break into his home thinking he is the other Lebowski and one pees on his rug, it all goes down hill from there for The Dude.With a stellar supporting cast, led by John Goodman who is incredible in this film as The Dude's best bowling buddy and insane converted-Jewish Vietnam vet, ""Lebowski"" is original and deep-belly laughing funny. But not only that, the events of the film all say something important about when we choose to take action and when it might be best to let things be. The film's scenes are either funny and quotable, creepy and eerie or both. Usually both. All the gags, however, seem to have a point. If not in what their message is/how it contributes to the film, than at least in the way they grab your attention. Every scene in the film is effective in this way.""Lebowski"" is undeniable proof that comedy can have a purpose other than mere entertainment. It is a film with purpose beyond humor. It is both strange, funny and meaningful. While not nearly as recognized or critically acclaimed as ""Fargo,"" per say, the effective combination that is so rare in film definitely warrants Coen brothers fans the rationale to say ""Lebowski"" is their best project.",The Big Lebowski

Bridges, Goodman, and Buscemi make a congenial trio, seeming at home in the bowling league they seem to live for, and Turturro makes a surprising and memorable appearance as ""The Jesus"".  The dream sequences, a Coen staple, were never more fitting or more funny, particularly when Lebowski goes from his flight over L.A. to a Busby Berkeley-esque production line full of Viking women led by Moore's dominating heiress.  Even to its last bittersweet moments, this is a memorable dark comedy that brings all the Coen's best elements to the fore.",The Big Lebowski
67,Anonymous_Maxine,What in God's holy name are you blathering about?!,10,26 March 2002,"There's really only one good part of The Big Lebowski, but it's a REALLY good part. It's one of those scenes that you see in a movie and you tell your friends about it for years, you constantly spout off hilarious quotes from that scene that you remember laughing so hard about, you develop inside jokes about the scene with the friends who were lucky enough to be there to watch it with you, and you may even begin to regularly consume certain types of alcoholic beverages that you saw enjoyed by the main characters in that scene. The earth-quakingly memorable scene (indeed, as I said before, the only good scene in the entire film) is the one that begins immediately after the opening credits and ends approximately 117 minute later just before the screen fades and the end credits roll.Not laughing? To hell with you, that's funny! And the movie's even funnier! Every character in The Big Lebowski is developed perfectly to serve the purpose of the story. These characters truly have personality, especially The Dude ('Who the f**k IS this guy?!'), Walter ('Donny, you're out of your league!'), and even Mr. Lebowski's geeky assistant, Brandt. They may occasionally be stereotypical characters, but they fit perfectly with the story, augmenting it even though it's already complex and interesting. This movie has an excellent plot line that is punctuated with endlessly hilarious dialogue ('Donny, you're outta your element!'), and peppered with well-developed and interesting characters. Jeff Bridges delivers a spectacular performance as the Dude, flawlessly capturing the slacker attitude and lazy lifestyle that that character lives. His love for White Russians has made that drink a staple at my house, and is now among my favorite alcoholic drinks.Yeah, big accomplishment, but that's the kind of thing that makes a movie like this even better. As a college student, I can see the difference between the slacker life that I lived in high school, and the extremely busy one that I live now. The Dude has chosen to perpetuate that lifestyle, living his life on the couch and at the bowling alley, constantly dirt-poor but obviously perfectly content with himself. The only time he is even the slightest bit upset is when something disrupts that lifestyle and his rug gets ruined. Clearly, a nice rug is not something that a person in The Dude's line of work (i.e. unemployment) can easily replace. He is even almost completely calm when the guys break into his apartment at the beginning of the movie, and doesn't really seem to be too upset until one of them p****s on his rug.The interactions between The Dude, Walter (John Goodman), Donny (Steve Buscemi), and, eventually, the Jesus combine to make some of the most amusing moments of the film, but it is enormously entertaining from beginning to end. There cannot possibly be enough praise given to this movie to do it justice. Watch this movie, you are sure to love it. And if you don't, watch it again, because you must have missed something.

68,southdavid,A Perfect Strike !,9,25 September 2018,"Recently given a one night cinematic return to mark 20 years since its initial release. ""The Big Lebowski"" remains on the highpoints of the Coen Brothers remarkable career of excellence. Their farcical homage to Raymond Chandler stars Jeff Bridges, as ""The Dude"" whose real name, Jeff Lebowski drags him into a plot to ransom the wife of his namesake, played by David Huddleston. Blackmailers come to the wrong address, rugs are pissed on and threats are made. Eventually the ""Big"" Lebowski chooses ""The Dude"" to be the bag man for the ransom drop off. A decision that all involved soon come to regret. Twenty years has allowed me to watch ""The Big Lebowski"" a few times, and to be fair it's a film that improves with each watch. The plot is nothing special, in fact it's almost non-existant. The character revolve around each other and at the end of it you're no wiser as to who, if anyone, actually kidnapped Bunny (Tara Reid) or what happened to the $1M dollars. . But you come to appreciate that the plot isn't as important as the characters and what characters they are. Jeff Bridges gives a career best performance as ""The Dude"".... Mumbling and ""man-ing"" his way through the film, which belies the wit that he sometimes allows a glimpse of. It is one of the funniest, most quotable movies of all time.

69,jzappa,"A Bizarrely Winning Fargo Follow-Up Seen Best Through a Haze of Bong Smoke, Whether Yours or the Characters'",8,11 July 2011,"The Coen brothers' The Big Lebowski is a friendly, clumsy comedy about a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself the Dude, and is illustrated by the narrator as ""the laziest man in Los Angeles County."" He lives merely to go bowling, but is taken for a millionaire named the Big Lebowski, with calamitous results. We all know people like the Dude, and so, supposedly, do the Coen brothers. They rooted the character in a producer named Jeff Dowd. Both dudes rely on lateral thinking much more than orderliness.The Dude is paid a visit by two enforcers who obviously have the wrong Lebowski, but before they discover that, one has already peed on the Dude's rug, sparking intense hostility: ""That rug really tied the room together,"" the Dude laments. John Goodman's Walter Sobchak leads the vendetta. Sponging lines straight from Bush 41, he declares that ""this aggression will not stand"" and insists the Dude ""draw a line in the sand."" The Dude drops in on the real Lebowski, leaves with one of his rugs, and soon finds himself solicited into the millionaire's conspiracies.Rich Lebowski, wheelchair-bound like General Sternwood and staring into a fireplace like Major Amberson, wants the Dude to deliver his wife Bunny's ransom. This plot is countered by Maude, Lebowski's eccentric daughter from a past marriage. Julianne Moore, who played a porno actress in the great Boogie Nights, here plays a largely dissimilar sort of erotic artist, swathing herself in paint and launching herself through the air in a leather harness. L.A. in this film is a menagerie of idiosyncratic characters. One of the funniest is a Latino bowler named Jesus. The Dude is prone to lively fantasies when he's punched out or knocked unconscious, which occurs frequently, and one of them turns into a musical comedy set piece featuring a beautiful POV shot from within a bowling ball.The Big Lebowski tears across all trajectories and never goes anywhere. That isn't so much a failing as its technique. The Dude, who rocks a lot of ganj,' swigs White Russians mixed with half-and-half, begins each day full of determination, but his devices steadily melt into a fog of lost chances and misconstrued intent. The atmosphere is set up right at first, when the narrator begins sufficiently well but ultimately admits he's lost his own gist, a droll curveball drawing our attention to the incidence of screenwriters who will never be unwilling to remove all support from us even after it has been literally soiled by a shaggy-dog-story character we may or may not ever see again in this chaotic plot.This could never equal its predecessor Fargo, but it's bizarrely winning, like its hero, played by Jeff Bridges with a goatee, potbelly, ponytail and Bermuda shorts so bulky they may have been scrounged from his sounding board and bowling partner, Walter Sobchak. Their other teammate is Donny, who may not be too sharp-witted, but it's difficult to know as he's never permitted to finish a sentence. Set at the time of the Gulf War, here are characters whose language was created by earlier times, Vietnam, flower power and the Twilight Zone. As with Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski shows us a protagonist whose doofus-y simplicity appears to be his sole defense from the real world. He and Walter's very idea of real life may be wrought by the narrow ways they have to express it. Bridges does more with his downcast physical expression than countless comics can manage by laying it on thick.From its opening credits, The Big Lebowski indeed appears and feels like a shuck-and-jive. That's why the recognizable premise of a staged kidnapping complete with betrayals is only outwardly commonplace. Crime and reason are not the concerns here. What matters is how hard-wearing the two or three characters we're most concerned for are, despite the misfortune generated by their own ineptness. The Big Lebowski---a surrealist farce cooked up by the unruly Coens out of odds and ends of the deep-rooted and the new-fangled, the philosophical and the primal, in a fraction of LA where heightened reality crashes with autistic character interaction---amounts to noticeably less than the sum of its frequently lively and entertaining parts.",The Big Lebowski

Steve Buscemi is the same too, having an almost silent role here. The only more special ones are Julianne Moore and John Turturro.

71,elshikh4,The American Loser !,7,4 January 2008,"The American young man who fought in Vietnam yesterday became now a 40-years-old hippie, all-the-time stoned unemployed bum, who lives the crazy world of the early 1990s America.. As what exactly? The possible hero of this very world! How is that? That's the knack, and the crack, of this black farce.(Lebowski) is the name of the rich famous billionaire, and the name of the poor sluggish dude also. And the irony of the situation means that both of them are disabled (one crippled, and one doped!), having problems, yet only one is noble or at least less mean. This is the main irony which the whole thing had been grounded on, because that last characteristic of our good old idiot is the very thing which made him such a hero of his world, and what a world indeed, as we've been watching such a punchy bunch of the most sick, contemptible, foolish, defeated, dull, opportunist, criminal variety of all time, or to be specific that time of 1991 which the movie chooses carefully to make its events and point of view too.The Coen brothers made a sarcastic epitome of the American society by vivid sense of humor and such a dark discerning satire in the same time. Whereas the whole commentary vents the spleen on the powers of the big ruling corporations and their small beaten victims too. There is that unique caricature community: the rich people are good deceivers, hate each others, have no moralities, or even a next generation! Then the poor people are maybe quite the same, but with some love (the friendship of Dude and Walter), some innocence, and had been utilized by the rich people all along (the rich Lebowski and his game with the dude, the powerful characters who want the dude to bring the money or find the wife, Maude Lebowski; played by Julianne Moore who wants to get a baby from the dude as a typical non-noisy father!). They form together the ideal pieces of an dystopian collapsed world!Moreover, what is the art of this world anyway, as the truthful reflection of it?! The high art of (Maude Lebowski) which's absurd and too arduous to understand, long TV shows which their author lives as dead maybe like his viewers who the rest of them are as deranged as (Walter), played by (John Goodman), his biggest fan, and finally the porn movies which their producer sees logically that the molds of entertaining have gone low so let's make sex as nobody needs stories anymore (that reminds me of Hollywood sometimes!).So in that kind of world, there is no wonder when you have passive funny losers, like the dude and his mentally deranged violent friend, where both are dying by their Vietnam past and playful present, so bowling is their life which literally and metaphorically was their daily illusory victory, and now it makes sense when the Coens cleverly put it all in the early shadows of the Iraq's war as maybe the next helpless Vietnam; as if nothing changed since the first sin, as long as the dude is still the same lazy brainless tumbler, being the perfect puppet in the hands of the perverse bossy players who had all the powers. However, his sole virtue is that he's well-meaning to be everybody's fool, and smart enough to grasp their perfidy and meanness after all!I loved some talented touches which create such a solid comic cosmos: The owner of the house is a ruling man yet another loser, (Saddam Hussein) - the president of Iraq at the time - became an upcoming part of the fancy big game, as in the second dream, where the dude himself is the ball in the hands of the rich brats, the office of the rich (Lebowski) looks like the oval office of the American president in the white house, The Dude is flying over the city then falls; like failed Superman, the fine genuine cowboy, or the original American, played by (Sam Elliott), is the narrator; ironically named on the credits (The Stranger), there is no complete sane love story in here at all! And the sudden death of the poor friend (Donny), played by (Steve Buscemi), ""as all the young youth who died before him!"" to make sure that the next generation will be sick already by the defeat of their lousy mentors, and they'll be weaker to get along with all of that dominating madness around. Although I didn't like that death as something a bit out of the drama, but maybe it was made to confirm the sense of loss at the end.There were some flaws; like how did the dude perceive the hidden truth?! Characters like a homosexual bowling player named Jesus, or a landlord who loves experimental theater weren't comic or part of the drama, being just odd characters for oddity. But aside from that, everything was hilariously sincere to the true lunatic nature of the lead character and its world; for instance, the 2 dreamy sequences. As for the acting, it was a dexterous comedy from everybody, but I thought that (John Goodman) did much better job as (Walter) than (Jeff Bridges) as (The Dude).All in all, it's some rereading of that world which is unbalanced; utterly like its hero (Lebowski), so by far you must understand easily what the meaning of (The Big) in the title is. It isn't a reference to who would be the most important (Lebowski) in the movie. No, it's a smart hint to a Big community of (Lebowski) dudes out of the movie!",The Big Lebowski

The wealthy mans wife is kidnapped and the dude is drafted to be the go between for the ransom payoff for her safe return. The dude smokes loads of pot, drinks heavily and enjoys bowling on a regular basis. His best friend is Walter, played by John Goodman as a Gulf War veteran with a violent temper.

The script is great and entire cast outstanding. Bridge's character has become something of a slacker icon - there is even a 'church' dedicated to celebrating his easygoing philosophy.

74,freemantle_uk,Cult Comedy,10,18 April 2008,"This was the first Coen brother's film and I saw and I thought it was great. The Big Lebowski is surreal dark comedy about Jeff 'the Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) becoming mixed up with German gangsters, the kidnapping of an ex-porn star throne wife of the rich Jeff 'the Big' Lebowski and Jeff Lebowski's daughter, a modern artist. The Dude gets mixed up with these events when gangsters break into his apartment and demands money from him until they realised they got the wrong Lebowski. The Dude friend, Walter (John Goodman), convicts him to go to the Big Lebowski home and demand compensation from him. It was after this visit when the Dude and Walter gets mixed up with the kidnap plot. The Big Lebowski asks the Dude to drop the ransom money off for him and thereby get Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid) back. However Walter came with him on the mission and steals the ransom money. It was from there that things started to go worst and worst.The Big Lebowski is an excellent film which is extreme funny. It has some get characters, especially the Dude as a lazy ageing hippie and Walter as a mad militaristic nut case (he was meant to be based on John Milius). The film also uses many types of humour, from dark humour which the Coen brothers do really well, psychical and little slapstick, intelligent involving some of the jokes used, surreal using dream sequences and a little catchphrase based with the classic 'shut the f**k up Donny!'The Big Lebowski is well worth watching.",The Big Lebowski
75,Polaris_DiB,Character-driven brilliance!,10,29 October 2005,"This movie is very personal to me. The Coen Brothers have always been a favorite of my family and The Dude looks, acts, and talks exactly like my dead father.That said, my high score for this film is not just because I like it, but because it's excellent. I'm going to save the usual great directing, acting, cinematography, editing, and humor (all of which it has) and move into a few unique traits of this film that never cease to fascinate me no matter how many times I watch it.First of all, the dialog specifically. Move over, Tarantino and Kevin Smith, you have been owned. This dialog is faster, wittier, more real, and creates better characters through tangents than you could hope possible. Was the dialog even written down? Most of the time it seems the actors are just playing off each other's direction and they are talking about whatever they want to, and yet previous conversations and conceits and the like keep re-emerging later, characters go off on regular tangents (and I'm not just talking about the Vietnam War, either), and the actors never, ever fall out of character. It's amazing to behold.Secondly, the storyline's general arch. Many conversations I've had with people end up going into a lot of discussion over the fact that he never gets his rug back. In fact, the whole movie is kind of tragic in the way The Dude ends up worse off than he was before, but then again he's happier and the status quo has returned, so it's still contained brilliantly. The thing is that the Coen brothers tend to write very character-driven plots, where the character's personalities do so much more than the events they create to propel them into more and more absurd situations. Furthermore, it's not like the characters just move on to the next scene and the last scene is almost irregardless, like a lot of lesser character-driven plots: it all ties together and is contained beautifully. This movie could not have ended any other way.Finally, I won't bore you with the regular talk about how great a character The Dude is (even though he is), I want to talk about Walter Sobchack. Honestly, this the role John Goodman was born to do, and of course he did it brilliantly. Not only can I not imagine anyone else doing it, I can't imagine anybody else perfectly complimenting Dude. Together with Donnie, the three make a relationship so much more real than almost ever shown on screen.--PolarisDiB",The Big Lebowski
76,ackstasis,I Was A Bit Underwhelmed By This Film...,6,5 January 2007,"First of all, I love the Coen brothers. Just about every one of their films is stunningly written, with enough wit in their dialogue to rival Tarantino in his 'Pulp Fiction' form. Stunningly directed, riotously funny and brimming with unique and colourful characters, their films are always a pleasure to watch.Jeff Bridges portrays Jeffrey Lebowski, a man who'd rather just be called The Dude. However, when criminals mistake him for a rich Jeffrey Lebowski (The Big Lebowski), a misinformed break-and-entry results in The Dude's prized rug getting urinated upon. ""That rug really held the room together,"" a dejected Dude remarks, and so he goes to visit The Big Lebowski, whom he considers responsible for such an unpleasant occurrence. Little does The Dude realise that his visit will bring about considerable more trouble than just a soiled rug...'The Big Lebowski,' like most Coen brothers' films, is certainly a funny and reasonably well-written story, however, I found myself slightly underwhelmed by it. A lot of the time, it felt like weird characters were simply thrown into the mix simply to be weird, without serving any real purpose. I'm yet to work out the reasons for including the Stranger (Sam Elliott), whose cowboy-type character narrates the the beginning and the end of the story, with a brief cameo appearance somewhere in the middle. The completely unnecessary breaking of the ""fourth wall"" at the end of the film just seemed out of place with the rest of the story. And how did the Stranger even know about the Dude's story, having just exchanged a few words with him at the bowling bar? It beats me, but perhaps I'm just completely missing the point.However, these grievances aside, it must be said that there are many genuinely funny moments in this film, most of them arising from John Goodman's perfectly-played character, Walter Sobchak. With stunning comedic timing, the Coen film regular (Barton Fink, O Brother Where Art Thou) hilariously spouts out his well-written dialogue, which usually (for no apparent reason) references Sobchak's own service in the Vietnam War, or otherwise belittles his under-appreciated and often-ignored bowling partner Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi).'The Big Lebowski' is a funny film, and well worth your time. However, I was simply unable to take it seriously as a film (nor should I have tried), so I couldn't rate it any higher. It just didn't have the professional class of the Coen brothers' other films...",The Big Lebowski
77,Coxer99,The Dude Abides!!!,10,24 February 1999,"No movie has entertained me more in the last year than this film. It's delightfully written, directed with poise and acted with extravagance and excellence. I do admit that this is a film that I had to see six times to get. Every time I watch it I learn something new. The genius of the film lies within a game I think the Coen brothers play with their audiences. There are the touches of the masters in many of their films. In ""The Hudsucker Proxy,"" it was Preston Sturges and Frank Capra. In ""Raising Arizona,"" I felt a touch of Sam Fuller. In this film, I felt many touches of greatness, but more specifically I felt John Sayles or even John Cassevettes in spots. The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding, especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as ""Jesus,"" coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles, ""Hotel California,"" done in Espanol. I hope this is a film that is looked at with more seriousness. It is, once you dig deep, a fine piece of filmmaking.",The Big Lebowski

Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi may have been able to carry this thing by themselves, staggered around a rickety old bowling lane with just a wardrobe and a copy of the Coen brothers' script, but when their performances are matched by a blindingly colorful supporting cast, a plot that swerves around like a drunken driver and the brothers' unmistakable eye for subtlety, the end result is pure magic. I could watch this three times a year and never get tired of it.",The Big Lebowski
80,st-shot,Living in the Past,9,29 March 2008,"The Dude is content to let life go by if can bowl once a week, get stoned and sit in his bathtub surrounded by candles. This meditative deadbeat existence is suddenly thrown into disarray however when a couple of thug debt collectors break into his pad, shove his head in the toilet and urinate on his rug. It turns out he is a victim of mistaken identity. At the urging of his semi-psycho bowling partner Walter (he pulls out a 45 to settle an argument over two pins)Dude seeks recompense from the intended Lebowski, a well heeled millionaire with a mansion and a teenage wife who may have been kidnapped by German nihilists.Jeff Bridges is a perfect fit as The Dude inhabiting the mannerisms and style as well as displaying the contented munchies developed gut of a lifetime passive resister still living the summer of love. In perfect counterbalance is fellow kegler and ex Viet vet Walter who is also living in the past but at Tet. By share force of personality John Goodman's Walter occupies center stage as much as Dude. Shadowing wispily in the background the timid Donny (Steve Buscemi)rounds out the unlikely trio. In a bowling tournament sub-plot opponent John Turturro as Jesus is over the top hilarious as he baits Walter and The Dude. Philip Seymour Hoffman as millionaire Lebowski's obsequious assistant also registers in a brief role.Like its protagonist The Big Lebowski is a lovable shaggy dog of a movie whose layed back style purposely and with hilarious results undermines the seriousness and suspense of the kidnapping and amputation that drive the plot. Not since the late Pro Bowler Ray Bluth's unique bowling style has the game been presented in such an unorthodox way. Taking the mundane washed out color setting of a bowling alley (including the parking lot) the brothers Coen create a surreal dream in which eras and genres collide as they borrow from and update classics with their own visual flare. From the bowlers montage over the credits to Busby Berkeley musical numbers, Jesus's entrance and the out of sync conversations between the team the Coens deftly utilize the alley setting, fully realizing it's ignored potential of pop art and surrealism.The convoluted plot might suggest some Big Sleep and the anachronistic Dude might have a resemblance to Gould's Long Goodbye Marlowe but the style and presentation are pure Coen in three hundred game form.",The Big Lebowski
81,MaxBorg89,"Keep'em coming, Dude!",10,15 August 2008,"If Fargo is the highest point in the Coen brothers' filmography, The Big Lebowski comes in a close second: it's a perfect hybrid of fun, mystery, irony and pure insanity, Joel and Ethan's most explicitly entertaining movie since Raising Arizona, and by far more accomplished.The plot, loosely based on Raymond Chandler's works (the title itself is an obvious pastiche of The Big Sleep), revolves around a former hippie, Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who insists everyone refer to him as The Dude or, in extreme cases, something like His Dudeness or El Duderino. To call The Dude an underachiever is a euphemism: he's never achieved anything, in fact he spends his days doing nothing besides smoking marijuana, drinking White Russians or bowling with his ""friends"" Walter (John Goodman), a Vietnam veteran with a life philosophy like no one else, and Donnie (Steve Buscemi), who isn't actually allowed to do much since everyone constantly asks him to ""shut the f*ck up"" (whereas in Fargo it was impossible to prevent him from talking).The Dude's quiet existence is radically shaken up when he is assaulted for no reason by two men who even take the liberty of peeing on his rug. As it turns out, they mistook him for another Jeffrey Lebowski, the one mentioned in the title, a wheelchair-bound millionaire whose young wife (Tara Reid) appears to have been kidnapped by a band of Nihilists (led by Peter Stormare). Add a sleazy pornographer (Ben Gazzara), the other Lebowski's artist daughter Maude (Julianne Moore), the mysterious stranger (Sam Elliott) whose voice occasionally comments on the story, a child-molesting bowling champion (John Turturro) named Jesus (""That's right! Nobody f*cks with the Jesus!""), some freaky dream sequences and several mix-ups and it's no longer very surprising that The Dude needs absurd quantities of booze and pot to accept what's happening to him.As a matter of fact, what happens is actually the least interesting aspect of the film: the noirish premise is nothing but a MacGuffin, a cheap yet brilliant excuse to make all those wonderful characters interact with the Coens' trademark exquisite dialogue, the best lines coming out of Goodman's mouth (""This is what happens when you f*ck a stranger in the ass!""). The fine ensemble cast gives life to a singular group of pederasts, pimps, private investigators and slackers, above whom Bridges towers with a humanity that makes you want to hug him on the spot. The Dude, a revolutionary at heart even when there seems to be nothing left to fight for, is the brothers' most relatable and endearing creation next to Fargo's Marge Gunderson, and it's no surprise: in the twisted Coeniverse, they're as normal as they come.Overall, pretty much a modern classic, like most of the Coens' films, and, despite its dark streak, a bit of a feel-good movie, thanks to its oddly sweet and charming protagonist. As The Stranger points out: ""It's good knowing he's out there, The Dude.""",The Big Lebowski
82,estebangonzalez10,Dude what a good movie!,8,16 September 2010,"What a strange film, but heck it is funny and grabs your attention from the opening scene. Only the Coen brothers can get away with a movie like this thanks to a very smart script and great performances from the entire cast. I think that The Coen brothers are the best at casting the right actors for the right parts because every actor seems to make their best film in a movie directed by the Coens. Jeff Bridges gives one of his best performances as The Dude, a very complex character who seems to live his life playing bowling, smoking weed, and drinking white vodka all the time. Then there is John Goodman who gives his best performance to date as well with his character who has some anger management issues and always lives in the past reminding everyone when he gets the chance that he is a Vietnam war veteran. Steve Buscemi plays a completely different role from the ones he is used to playing, he does not even talk that much this time around. And finally John Turturro who had a very small part playing a Hispanic pedophile named Jesus but who was just hilarious in every scene. This is not your typical buddy comedy, this is much more than that, it takes things from different genres and makes this a completely original comedy. Even the strange dream sequences serve as a sort of lowering and rising the curtains for the next act. You cannot have a successful comedy without a good script and The Big Lebowski has an excellent and funny script. This is my favorite Coen comedy and will always be the standard for their future comedies. Who else could make a movie about a man trying to get his rug back and making it so complex. With other movies such as Fargo and No Country for Old Men, the brothers prove they can direct any film genre.",The Big Lebowski

This movie is a good example of how good writing, acting, and character study can really carry a movie. In the movie, ""The Dude,"" as Jeffrey Lebowski refers to himself, is targeted by mobsters because he has the same name as a wealthy businessman whom they are REALLY trying to get. Violent and hilarious situation ensues as The Dude, who is a carefree beach bum who also spends a great deal of time at the bowling alley, enlists his gun-toting pal Walter and friend Donnie to defend him.This film is filled with terrific situations, quirky characters, and unforgettable moments.

The comedy is really scarce, forced and often unfunny.The 'brother Seamus' line is also nice.Goodman talks about Shabbas and Jewish things with conviction, he remembers the Asian wars and still loves Cynthia; yet the life the character gets comes not from the script—but from Goodman's gusto.My assessment is that LEBOWSKI is a very poorly written script; the directing is needlessly 'classy' and artsy.

87,slokes,Making Vit Der Funny Schtuff,5,2 December 2004,"""The Big Lebowski"" is proof a screenplay doesn't need a story to make it today. Just create a couple of oddballs who have gloriously fractured conversations about any sort of bizarre thing, throw in a bunch of random stuff and an eccentric supporting cast, and don't worry if the plot doesn't actually go anywhere. Think ""Caddyshack"" with more cursing, a perfect film for regurgitating around a water cooler rather than watching on screen.Jeff Bridges is the Dude, Jeff Lebowski, who because of some confusion with another Jeff Lebowski whose wife owes money to a sleazy porn merchant, finds himself the target of two toughs who ""soil"" his rug. Trouble accumulates as he seeks restitution and is recruited to help rescue the other Lebowski's kidnapped wife. Complications ensue when the other Lebowski's daughter seeks him out for a sperm donation, a gang of nihilists threaten his johnson, a detective trails after him in a blue Beetle, and stuff keeps happening to his car. The worst part is the constant interference from his bowling buddy, Walter (John Goodman), who sees parallels with Vietnam for everything, blows the ransom delivery, and butts heads with a rival bowler with a sex-offender past.I don't know, that doesn't read funny. But the movie is funny, especially when Walter and the Dude bicker. Getting this across from writing dialogue excerpts is not possible, not because of the profanity so much as the delivery, which is how it comes together. If comedic acting got the respect it deserves, Goodman would have been nominated for an Oscar; his Walter is a brilliant contrast of sudden rage and anal nitpicking (""The chinaman is not the issue here, dude. I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, dude. Across this line, you DO NOT... Also, dude, chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American, please."") Even Goodman's presence, wearing pus-colored sunglasses and a perpetual scowl under a buzzcut, is a marvel.But Goodman's brilliance is in how well he walks the fine line set by the Coen Brothers in a typically challenging film for actors. Bridges is very good, too, but Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro and other good actors are so mannered they become annoying.Also, the story lines just kind of meander with no direction, like the Coens are ridiculing you for attempting to care about how any of it turns out. Did the Dude ever get a new rug? Did he and Walter win the match against Jesus the child molester? What the heck was the point of the cowboy narrator? If you care enough to ask such questions, it's like you are just the butt of the Coens' joke? Who's the %$&@ing nihilists here?The film's weaknesses are evident even in the moments that shine, like a trio of musical comedy numbers done to music by Bob Dylan and Kenny Rogers. They are witty, vibrant set pieces that come in out of nowhere and charge quickly into various cartoony bits, but then meander and drizzle away, lamely explained as acid flashbacks the Dude keeps having when he is knocked out. They don't add anything to the story, but in that sense, at least they are consistent with the rest of what's presented.The Coen Brothers remind me of the '70s jazz popsters Steely Dan, two arch standoffish types who are expert entertainers and creative geniuses but somewhat handicapped by their acerbic pose. They don't like being mistaken for someone who cares. The Coens have made some terrific films, like ""Raising Arizona"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" and some overrated ones like ""Fargo"" and this. It's a film designed to make people laugh, and that's nice of them, but when one of the big jokes in the film involves casually killing off one of the good guys, you have to wonder whether the joke is really on you.",The Big Lebowski
88,gcd70,Misses the Mark,5,21 March 2010,"The Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, have fired several shots here at another one of their obscure targets. In this instance, unlike the triumphs of ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowsky"" misses the mark on most counts.It is hard to work out what the lads were actually up to here. This film contains the ""Coen"" regulars such as a reluctant hero and a double twist in the plot, yet so much appears to be misplaced. Strange dreams containing trampolining nudes and giant bowling alleys, and a narrator come stranger played by Sam Elliott are all a little confusing. Maybe the Coens always wanted to work with the legendary Elliott; as for the weird dreams, well that's anybody's guess.Jeff Bridges is ideal as the dated ""dude"", a throw back to the sixties when drugs and hippies were cool. Playing his close friend, John Goodman surprises as the short-fused Vietman-vet who specialises in getting the dude deeper into trouble. Other bizarre roles go to the sex-deviant bowler (John Turturro) and Peter Stormare as the ringleader of a German kidnapping group. Steve Buscemi, always fun, gets too little time on screen playing the third of the dude's trio.It is a shame ""The Big Lebowsky"" didn't have the focus Coen brothers films normally have.

Our basic plot is stoner and loser Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski is mistaken for millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski, when men break in to his house and pee on his rug. To get the money for the rug The Dude goes to Jeffrey Lebowski, and ends up on a mission to find rich Lebowski's kidnapped wife. The movie is fairly fast paced, but that doesn't stop it from having periods of heavy clever dialogue, mostly between John Goodman as the ex-Vietnam veteran Walter and the Dude. Many of the film's most entertaining scenes are located in the bowling alley where The Dude, Walter and Donnie (Buscemi) talk about nothing and (of course) bowl. The backup cast is really good also, including Julianne Moore as the ""kidnapped"" wife and John Turturro as a sex offender bowler.

The film is ridiculously enjoyable, with great performances all around, especially from Jeff Bridges as 'The Dude' and John Goodman as Walter. The plot is messy, but adequate, and provides a very interesting line to follow- even if it isn't perfect. The direction is masterful, the Coen brothers do a fantastic job as always, and the cinematography is terrific as well. Very few films use its soundtrack as usefully as this one does, and I was very glad to hear such a great sound and thus resulting from it- a great atmosphere- from the film and was pleasantly surprised of its inclusion in the film.

I can't speak to the nature of how this was received when it came out- I was only eight when it hit theaters- but I can speak to the nature of how myself and many of those close to me feel about it, and I can speak to its increasing relevance of it today. This movie is a masterpiece that has no equal simply because there is absolutely nothing else like it under the sun. The Dude (Jeff Bridges, ""The Fisher King"") abides; he has since 1998 and he will until movies no longer are relevant.",The Big Lebowski
94,AudioFileZ,Big Budget Iconic Slacker Comedy,7,10 July 2021,"It's a cult classic which I do not recall watching. At least in anything remotely approaching any snippets in excess of, say, five minutes. Now, I like a ""wicked good"" comedy along the lines the Farrelley Brothers make. That would not usually be a Coen brothers flick. Perhaps that why at this late date I've only now watched The Big Lebowski. It's the closest the Coen's may ever delve into a bit of Farrelley's territory. Is that good enough?It starts out as ""The Stranger"" , who narrates mostly, introduces us to ""The Dude"". Now, ""The Stranger"" is obviously Sam Elliott he of such singular voice that when he tells you what's for dinner all vegetarians realize they've been idiots. But I digress. ""The Dude"", Jeff Lebowski is an ""ultimate slacker"". He's a walking theorem of energy conservation comfortable in his own skin...and bathrobe. It goes with scant explaining that he has no need for those things that you'd find in a Louis Vuitton boutique. He's uncomplicated his life down to his house shoes. Suddenly that is rudely interrupted by the inconvenient fact his real name, Jeffrey Lebowski, is scarred by a very wealthy man complete with empty vessel family members who have screwed others as these types do. These ""screwed others"" want theirs and in an act of identity crisis confuse ""The Dude"" with the wealthy Lebowski. A violation based on this mistaken identity ensues upsetting ""The Dude's"" uncomplicated existence. As such the rich Lebowski owes the poor Lebowski, at a minimum, a new rug (see movie for rug facts). And now for the celluloid version of a left turn at Albuquerque. It's quite a visual nutty ride. To make any sense of it there that other dude ""The Stranger"" who does a little summation at the end of this senseless story. Sometimes senseless is good enough.",The Big Lebowski
95,masonsaul,Incredibly unique comedy,9,9 September 2021,"The Big Lebowski is an incredibly unique comedy that's really funny and weird, with an aimlessness that both adds some fun unpredictability but also a lack of momentum at times. Jeff Bridges gives a perfect lead performance and John Goodman, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore are all incredible. Joel Coen's direction is excellent, it's extremely well filmed and hypnotic at times. The soundtrack is great.",The Big Lebowski
96,Amyth47,The Dude Abides...!,9,24 October 2018,My Rating : 9/10You either hate it or love it. I am in love with 'The Big Lebowski'! I love most of the Coen Brothers' work and this one is right up there with Fargo and No Country For Old Men. It's super funny and can be watched again and again. I think I watch it once a year and always have a great time.One that I highly recommend. Go watch it! And then watch it again and again.AN AWESOME CULT FILM.,The Big Lebowski
97,Seraphion,A great ride in a laid back mood,7,30 January 2015,"The story is so nicely lightweight that the whole case is actually dismissible from the entire movie. All those crazy antics The Dude does, and the stupid practical jokes that his responses make is just hilarious. I really like the marmot gag and the ash spreading gag, they are very entertaining. The character building is also very strong. The Dude, Walter and Donny are nicely three sides of a coin, the lazy no good bum, the overly strict and cranky hot-head, and the cowering coward ready to run from anything that shows the slightest sign of danger. The acting overall is quite nice. Jeff Bridges proves his acting prowess in role here as the lazy bum. John Goodman really inserts the crazy comedies from his lines and character role. Having Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare really adds very nicely, while Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hoffman complete the angles needed for the story.",The Big Lebowski
98,aimless-46,No..No...He Has Health Problems,10,2 August 2006,"""The Big Lebowski"" might actually be the funniest film of all time but only if you like its style of humor (parody and subtle off-kilter satire). Even then if you are anything like me you will find it only mildly funny during your first viewing. As others have said it really does get funnier each time you watch it, probably because you have to know the characters to appreciate much of the humor and because during the first viewing you are burning too much mental energy trying to follow the relatively complex plot (while not as complex as ""Miller's Crossing"" it still challenges viewers to pay close attention). The DVD does not have a commentary but it does have a short feature full of interviews, where the Coen Brothers explain some of their rationale for certain elements in the script and reveal places where the cast put their own individual marks on the film.""The Big Lebowski"" features the Coen's trademark comic style. They are students of films and their secret is taking a traditional character and creating an incongruity between the way you expect the character to talk and behave (as per movie conventions) and what actually happens. For ""The Big Lebowski"" the Coen's play with the detective, buddy picture, and the suspense genres. They set up a Philip Marlowe episodic detective story, but as their main character they substitute an aging pot-smoking bowler (Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski played by Jeff Bridges) for the film noir detective. Like Marlowe, the Dude gets caught up in scheme a whole lot bigger than he is and gets episodically pushed and pulled by a lot of strange characters. His buddy Walter Sobchek (John Goodman) is a blustering Viet Nam veteran who manages to further complicate almost every situation. Much of the humor comes from the way the supposedly laid back Dude continually comes unglued over Walter's behavior. Finally the Coens incorporate not one but two Hitchcock MacGuffins into the film. The series of unfortunate events are set in motion by a rug (the floor covering type) and midway into the film it is replaced as a motivating factor by a young woman (Tara Reid). Ultimately neither is of any importance yet they are the reason for everything that happens in the film. New Lebowski fans can be found drinking White Russians, entering their local bowling alley for the first time in years, looking up ""nihilist"" in the dictionary, and checking to see if TVLand is showing any ""Branded"" reruns. If any of that sounds like fun you should definitely check out the film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",The Big Lebowski
99,Galina_movie_fan,"It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.""",10,4 January 2015,"Looks like while making ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998)– weird, nutty, outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie, the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens, known for their unique and dry humor, sat back, laughed out loud, and had fun. ""Big Lebowski"" turned as one of the funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters, their weirdness, flaws, their interactions, the surreal situations they found themselves in, and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story, of course, which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping, villainous nihilists, vanguard erotic flying painter, the bowler named Jesus but the story is truly secondary to the delicious craziness of the movie.Some reviewers call Big Lebowski misfire and deranged mess, saying that the story is convoluted with the characters we would not care about a bit. It was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to Coens' ""Fargo"" that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of Jeffrey ""the Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges).""Fargo"" could be Coens' masterwork but it does not make Lebowski any worse. It was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future re-watch. The time has proved the predictions wrong. ""The Dude"" Lebowski - middle-aged pot smoking, White Russian drinking, bowling enthusiast ex-hippie, and his friends, Polish Catholic converted Jew, ""more Jewish than Tevye"" Vietnam veteran Walter with anger management problems (John Goodman) and timid, little slow, ""sweet prince"" Donny (unusually quiet Steve Buscemi) have become the cult figures, the beloved characters, for millions of film lovers of different generations, not only the baby- boomers.The Coen Brothers have made twenty films, and all of them are treasure, including their contribution in the 2006 anthology, Paris, je t'aime. I've seen all their films and I want to repeat the title of my review on their latest, ""Burn after reading"" - The Coen Brothers don't make bad movies, because they don't know how. Their films, Including the cult favorite, Big Lebowski, should not be missed. They are clever, darkly funny, and beautiful without being pretty pictures. In short, they are first class entertainment.",The Big Lebowski
100,RainDogJr,IN THE TOP 3 OF THE COEN BROTHERS............I'm the dude Man,10,27 March 2007,"The BIg Lebowski is maybe my favorite film of the Coen brothers ( the others are O Brother Were Art Thou? and Raising Arizona.....also Fargo) because is one of the greatest American comedies ever made. For me The comedies of the Coen brothers are much better than the thrillers like Simple Blood or MIller's Crossing and in the Big Lebowski they create a very funny role that was excellent plays by Jeff Bridges. The story is kind of simple: a man is confused by other man that has the same name and he is in a big trouble. But whats makes great this films is the actors and the funny touch of the directors.... Jonh Goodman and Steve Buscemi are just excellent, also Phillip Seymor Hoffman in a little role is excellent and other fact that i love in this film is that Flea from the RHCP has a participation (very little) in the film and i love the music of the RHCP. About the funniest dialogs and scenes in the film: well there are a lot but i love the scene when Walter put his gun in Somkey's head and other of Walter in when he gets angry because of the Shomer Shabbos. Of The Dude, they are a lot but i love when he says his versions of the kidnapping to The big Lebowski and also when he crash in his car. Donny...well Donny is funny in all his scenes and dialogs but when he says Lennon about Lennin is just great. All this parts of the film are great but the best is when Walter throws the bottle to the air with the rest of Donny. Other great character is Jesus and Jonh Turturro is excellent..............let me tell you something pendejo (his best dialog).",The Big Lebowski
101,Kingslaay,"Absolute rubbish, very overrated",3,24 April 2017,"Saying this film is overrated is an understatement. Why are some ludicrous films rated so highly? One might wonder if most of the viewership is amateur film goers or just stoned. Films like Forest Gump, The Wolf of Wall Street, Schindler's list or even art house ones like Birdman are great films. But The Big Lebowski is a Big Disappointment. It is a disjointed and abhorrent mess, sorry I'm using the word abhorrent here which might too big a word for most of the big raters of this film. I'll use simpler language for those who loved it, it stinks. This film made no sense and has to be one of the biggest disappointments of cinema. What an odd bunch of people it would take to make such a mess. It takes an even bigger odd bunch of people to love this film, write rave reviews and praise it. People obviously get a kick out of explaining something that isn't there. A spade isn't a spade to them.",The Big Lebowski
102,brando647,The Dude Abides...,10,20 March 2009,"No matter how many times I see this movie, it never gets old. At this point, I've easily seen it more than half a dozen times and I STILL find myself laughing throughout. This movie was my first exposure to the Coen brothers and it hooked me. Set in 1990's Los Angeles, the film follows the Dude, an unemployed stoner with a passion for bowling, as a case of mistaken identity and a soiled rug lead to his involvement in recovering a kid-napped woman. Honestly, that little synopsis doesn't do the film justice and it'd really be best to just watch it.The characters are what make this film so memorable. Jeff Bridges as the Dude, what can I say. Since seeing him in this movie, I haven't been able to picture him as anyone else (made it interesting seeing him as the villain in Jon Favreau's ""Iron Man"", heh). He totally embodies this character, with his chilled demeanor and stoned investigating. Stealing the scene almost as often as the lead is John Goodman as the Dude's buddy, Walter. A Vietnam veteran who can't help but regress to 'Nam rants every time something grates on his nerves, Walter's attempts to help Dude in his predicament only make matters worse. These two characters alone (with, of course, credit to the fantastic writing of the Coens) fill the movie with infinitely quotable dialogue.Supporting Bridges and Goodman are a myriad of great talent. Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, Peter Stormare, Sam Elliott, and Philip Seymour Hoffman contribute to film though the one of the best supporting characters has to be John Turturro's Jesus Quintana. Despite only being in two scenes, his role as the pedophile bowler made for one of the best moments. My absolute favorite sequences in the movie have to be the Dude's hallucinations/dream sequences, particularly the GUTTERBALLS number. A great soundtrack, wicked casting, sharp writing, and constant laughs give this movie infinite replay value and it'll never get old.",The Big Lebowski

104,LeonardKniffel,The Occasional Acid Flashback,6,30 April 2020,"The thing about movies made by the Coen Brothers is that I either love them (Fargo) or they leave me flat (The Big Lebowski). There is a thin line between comic and tragic, and here the lead characters never find it. As played by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, two dumber Polacks have never graced the silver screen. Yet, there is nothing Polish or Polish-American about these losers---""The Dude"" Lebowski and Walter Sobchak-except their names, and ""Sobchak"" is a very un-Polish spelling. There are a couple of assumptions that you have to make to laugh at the jokes in this 1998 film. One is that Polish surnames are innately funny and you should laugh when you hear one, especially when it is associated with intelligent thought or combined with an American given name (""Bunny Lebowski""). The only time you hear the word ""Polish"" in the movie is when The Dude explains to Sobchak that he is ""not even Jewish"": ""You're f---ing Polish-Catholic."" So why see this film? Because it raises a lot of questions, such as: What's so funny about stupidity? Why does John Goodman seem to be doing an imitation of Roseanne Barr? Would this have worked better as a cartoon? Why is ""Lebowski"" considered a ""jerk-off name""? Another reason is to watch Julianne Moore deliver another bizarre but intriguing performance. As Maude Lebowski, she leads The Dude, a burned-out hippie, into the only one of his lines that made me laugh out loud by asking him post-coitally what he does for recreation. As if it's the first time he's ever been asked, he thinks for a second, then replies, ""Go bowling, drive around, and the occasional acid flashback.""",The Big Lebowski
105,bandw,The Big Bust,2,1 May 2013,"I recently saw an interview with Jeff Bridges where he commented that he has become personally identified with ""The Dude,"" the character he plays in this movie. He also noted that ""The Big Lebowski"" has developed a cult following. The interviewer added some praise. That, together with the high rating on IMDb, convinced me to give this a shot. Early on I realized that the story was not to be taken seriously. This movie is a series of loosely connected comedy sketches (well, some hardly connected at all). The result is an absurdest comedy that had very few laughs for me.I did not find The Dude at all appealing as a person. How much is there to admire in someone whose life goals seem to be bowling and drinking white Russians? I do give Bridges credit for inhabiting the role. John Goodman's character really grated on me--his passions seem to be bowling and the f word. The positives: the scenes with John Turturro gave me some laughs; the scenes filmed from within a bowling ball were an interesting curiosity; some non sequiturs were worth a few chuckles.I guess one person's humor is another person's tedium. I found this movie to be tedious.",The Big Lebowski
106,valadas,Under bowling spell,5,5 July 2007,"That game in which you throw a huge ball at an arrangement of wooden pins trying to pull them all down and stay suffering the suspense of watching the ball trajectory along the alley till the end (in slow motion camera is much more thrilling) where it can pull them all down or fail some or most of them showing that at bowling like in life you are a loser. This movie strikes a certain parallel between bowling and real life, being the story of the misadventures of Jeffrey Lebowski (and Jeff Bridges performs a good role at it) caused by the fact that he has got the same name as a famous wealthy man which gets him into a lot of trouble narrated in a series of tragicomic episodes along with his two bowling pals one of them pretending to be a very smart guy but who only brings more trouble to our Lebowski man. Some of these episodes are funny indeed and are the best part of the movie since the story itself isn't worth much. Some others are not so funny including the one of an unnecessary death because death is rarely funny. The dialogues could be funnier if they didn't abuse of a well-known obscene four letter word which is repeated about three times in every five word sentence. I am no moralist at all but never could find any humour or aesthetic value in four letter words. I neither condemn nor approve of them; they just don't make me vibrate at all leaving me totally indifferent. They are only necessary in a work of art when they serve the purpose of defining someone's character. Is that the case here?

108,sme_no_densetsu,The Dude abides,8,3 August 2009,"Back in 1998 I rented ""The Big Lebowski"" based on the reputation of the Coen brothers's previous film (""Fargo""). Without any real expectations, my brother and I proceeded to watch it and by the end we were in agreement: We had just seen the funniest movie of all time. More than ten years later the film has aged gracefully and if it's not necessarily the funniest movie of all time then it's surely one of the top contenders.The film centres on Jeff Bridges, playing a slacker who likes to go by the name of 'The Dude'. 'The Big Lebowski' has the same name as Bridges's character but that's where the similarities end. After a case of mistaken identity 'The Dude' ends up acting as a courier for the other Lebowski, delivering ransom money to kidnappers. Naturally, things go about as wrong as they possibly could and hilarity ensues.The cast is top-notch. Jeff Bridges excels as 'The Dude' and he has great chemistry with both John Goodman & Julianne Moore. Throw in some Coen brothers vets like Steve Buscemi & John Turturro and add to that Philip Seymour Hoffman, Sam Elliott & others and you've got a cast that's to die for.The Coens deliver the goods with both the screenplay and the direction. There are a ton of hilarious, memorable quotes and the film's look is always interesting and attractive. They also make some fine use of music including Bob Dylan's ""The Man in Me"", The First Edition's ""Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)"" and a Spanish version of ""Hotel California"" by the Gypsy Kings. Overall, the film sports a much higher level of craftsmanship than we're used to seeing in modern comedies.In the end, though, the film's cult status must be mentioned. The film has attracted a loyal following but there are bound to be those that just don't 'get' the film. Since I am firmly in the 'followers' camp I strongly urge you to give the film a chance.",The Big Lebowski
109,Howlin Wolf,An utter delight from beginning to end. (SLIGHT SPOILER),10,18 November 2001,"Whilst I can't say it's the best FILM I've ever seen - there's a lot of competition for that title, and it's hard to pick just one - I CAN say that it's the best COMEDY I've ever seen. (Until 2005, when it was eclipsed by 1968's ""The Odd Couple""... ) The characters are just so eccentric yet superbly complex and detailed, as in all of the Coen's previous movies. The writing is treated with the same level of sophistication that the brothers bring to all their work, It's NOT dumbed down just by virtue of it being a comedy. Almost every line in the script is ripe for quotation.On a comedy level it works perfectly, but the storyline itself is just as intricate as we've come to expect from Joel and Ethan. Don't worry if you don't fully understand the plot machinations, it doesn't really matter when you are laughing so hard.Bridges is perfect as the perpetually stoned ""Dude"". He infuses the character with such a likable charm that you're likely to be smiling even when he hasn't said anything. There are an array of other colourful characters, but ""The Dude"" - ahem - 'really ties the film together'. He is a filmic icon and should be regarded as such for all time. There's also a great cameo by Sam Elliot (Man, I loved that guy in ""Mask""!)True, the film can't quite sustain its momentum throughout its running time, so there are slow spots (I didn't enjoy the scenes with Julianne Moore's character nearly as much as the others) but when it gets it right it's hilarious, and there are so many scenes that I wish I had wrote, but then I don't have 1/1000th of the talent of the REAL scripters.The Coens have created a filmic universe that you (or at least this writer) want to inhabit yourselves. The characters seem so lifelike and leap off the screen. I'm just waiting for the brothers to pen a sequel, I need to catch up on the further adventures of ""The Dude"" and his buddy Walter; even the sadly departed ""Donny"" (That calls for a prequel) How about it guys? Could you see your way clear... ?""Nice marmot!""P.S. Oh yeah, and the dream sequences are weird and wonderful too, watch for them!

And the rich guy got the reward money from her capture.It's a very complicated movie, I don't even know how to explain it. It's a very deep movie about probably the biggest slacker in the world.

112,Screen_Blitz,One of the most entertaining films by the Coen Brothers,8,21 January 2016,"Joel and Ethan Coen have stood high in the ranking of some of the best directors in Hollywood for the last two decades, and still to this today continue to make some of the biggest masterpieces. This black comedy starring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi, is a movie that did not perform well with critics nor saw much sunshine at the box office,; but eventually went on to becoming a cult classic and one of the my favorite comedies to date. This film follows Jeff Lebowski (played by Jeff Bridges), a drifter who lives under the name ""The Dude"" as his name happens to be the same name as a billionaire. To matters worse, this billionaire is married to a woman who is in serious debt and owes money to some of the most dangerous individuals in Los Angeles. With The Dude mistaken as the billionaire (played by David Huddleston), the Lebowksi's wife Bunny Lebowski (played by Tara Reid) is kidnapped by the dangerous men and orders The Dude to get their money. With the help of his bowling buddies Walter Sobchak (played by John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (played by Steve Buscemi), his plan makes a turn for the worst when he gets involved a series of dangerous schemes including corrupt police officers and Lebowkski's erotic daughter Maude (played by Julianne Moore).The Coen Brothers are often known for mixing genres in their films. This film pervades with a straight balance of comedy with a serious undertone, an achievement many black comedies do not do too well nowadays. What we get from this picture is a hilarious movie with an entertaining plot (though complex), solid performances, and some of the most memorable characters. Jeff Bridges nails it as the titular character, giving sharp dialogue and a clever sense of humor; none one could have played Jeff Lebowski a.k.a The Dude better than he. Jeff Bridges fits the bill. Then John Goodman who plays Walter Sobchak is quite hilarious and delivers some of the most clever lines in the film, though his character may have quite a crude personality, that is what makes him the funny man he is. The rest of the cast hits a home as well. The chemistry between Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi works astonishingly well; whenever these three hit the screen, that is when viewers should be ready for a hilarious good time, especially when John Turturro comes on screen. The humor, though not inspiring, is nicely written by Joel and Ethan Coen in ways to make it work, rather than beat down on clichéd gags. The only major flaw viewers may encounter is the difficulty connecting with the plot as it does tend to veer some odd directions at various points. Nonetheless, there are plenty of surprises, and twists and turns to keep the plot captivating.The Big Lebowski takes position as one of the Coen Brothers' best works, and one of the comedies of the 1990s. Thanks to the strong performances by an talented cast, clever dialogue, surprising humor, and solid characters; this film is one worth checking out for everyone.",The Big Lebowski

The story is simply a load of fun, but with great attention to detail, and with a perfect sense of humour. The soundtrack has no striking Carter Burwell theme this time (he only did that technopop thingy near the end), but it consists of various songs and themes, aptly chosen to befit the required mood; from classical to country or pop music and so on - I just discovered there's even a little bit played by the (Dutch) Koninklijk Concertgebouworkest.Apparently, there are some folks even who dón't like this film, or just don't get it, but I certainly don't feel like the Good Lord gypped me, because sometime there's a film... sometimes there's a film - kinda lost my train of thought here... but, aw, hell...11 out of 10.",The Big Lebowski

Or not. As such,I'm not even entirely sure what ""The Dude respects."" means,but I'm willing to take it as a good thing,and it seemed more fitting to preface a show so oddly appealing and unique.Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski(Jeff Bridges,long past being the handsome blonde leading man of yore,blissfully slobby and relaxed)lives what one might think is an idyllic life: not employed,yet living comfortably in a Southern California condo,whose only real activities seem to be bowling(LOTS of bowling)and toking(ditto that). He drinks(and seems to get his sole nourishment from)White Russians and grooves to early seventies fare(mostly Creedence Clearwater Revival)and seems to coast on a seamless lifestyle,which is rudely interrupted when some greedy nihilists(led by the always reliable creepy Peter Stormare)violate Dude's rug and demand money from him. Of course,they've got the wrong Lebowski;a much richer gentleman,also named Jeffrey Lebowski(what were the odds?)is their real target and he(David Huddleston)becomes the target of Dude's compensation plans. Of course,this will get more complicated when Mr.Lebwoski's nympho trophy wife(Tara Reid,great breakthrough role!)appears to be kidnapped by said nihilists,making the Dude now a seemingly valuable ""go-between"".After all that story,one would figure there'd be plenty with this film but oh no,there's still more,namely,the assortment of characters that the Dude has contact with: Dude's 2nd on the bowling team WAlter Sobchak(JOhn Goodman,grabbing some great lines here),the half-cocked Vietnam vet who also takes his Judaism VERY seriously;Donnie Kerabatsos(Steve Buscemi,recessive for once)the mousy third partner on Dude's team;Big Lebowski(Huddleston),a self-righteous pompous bastard with secrets;MAude Lebwoski(Julianne Moore,Euro-chic and severe),Big Lebowski's artist daughter and co-manager of the family trust,Jackie Treehorn(Ben Gazzara),a smooth porn magnate;Brandt(Philip Seymour Hoffman,when he was still a'anonymous""),a venal toadie for Big Lebowski;of course,the pea-brained nihilists and a mysterious stranger(Sam Elliott,for whom being a cowboy ISN'T acting)who frames the story as well as walks through it.THe Coen Brothers have a rep for making films that don't stay on the proverbial beaten path,and more work(""RAising Arizona"",""Miller's Crossing"",""FArgo"" and last year's ""No Country for Old Men"" come to mind)than don't(""Blind Date"",""Barton Fink"",""The HUdsucker Proxy"" seem to fit that).This movie is veritable poster child for that. Adding to the effect of this movie--besides the writing and directions of Coen squared--are Cinematograher Roger Deakins and Composer Carter Burwell(who've worked with the Coens numerous times before),and their touches are masterful. I saw this film again recently,purchasing it as a matter of fact. It doesn't get much ""playback""(i.e. cable re-running)and it's even somewhat of a hard find for the video stores,and yet much of the imagery from the first time I saw it a few months shy of ten years ago has stayed relatively fresh. Funny and poignant,raw yet strangely sensitive,sentimental but not sappy,this movie(and I've said it before,but I think it SO applies to this)is a definite keeper.

115,pyrocitor,Sometimes there's a film sometimes there's a film.,10,14 January 2010,"Now it was sometime in the year 1997, after the powers that be at the Academy of Motion Pictures and Science had decided to give a whole lot of recognition and awards to a film called Fargo, that a couple of boys named Joel and Ethan (though the most common nomenclature simply called them the Coen brothers) were thinking of making their next film. Now Joel and Ethan knew they had done well with their last film, that aforementioned Fargo, and they thought that their next film should be big. A big film. A film so big that it might as well have the word big in the title. And they - and we're talking about the Coen brothers here – well they just so happened to come up with such a motion picture, a picture which managed to be big as well as managing to be well outside of any range of conventional expectations. And that very motion picture happened to be one now known as The Big Lebowski.Or something like that. In fact, the Coens have, true to form, resisted discussing the inspiration for or meaning of what can still be considered one of their wildest, strangest and most inspired works of cinematic genius in as adamant and heated terms as the debates speculating on the film's 'true meaning' or 'purpose'. But part of the genius of the film is that whether regarded as a caustic political allegory (it is worth paying attention to the brief snippets of early 1990s American political news shown and referred to regardless), a loving and witty send up of all the conventions of a pulp, Raymond Chandler style film noir detective story (with a knowingly incomprehensible, convoluted plot) or simply a remarkably strange comedy, the film works. For whatever reason, the precise cocktail (a cinematic White Russian perchance) of absurdly quotable dialogue, inspired and memorable character bits, bizarre dream sequences, slow motion musical interludes and occasional dashes of self-reflexive profundity, all fused together by the impeccable technical double act of Roger Deakins' sumptuous cinematography and Carter Burwell's obtrusively resonant music makes for a work of strange, clunky madness and perfection which never quite manages to do what is expected of it or hit a wrong note, no matter what inferences or expectations the viewer brings to the table.But the film's true genius lies in the fact that, despite its guided bizarreness baiting analysis, the most gleefully likely 'point' is that the film, like the ongoing in-joke of its nihilist antagonists, is ultimately not about 'anything'. The entire enterprise can be seen as an extensive exercise in 'talking a lot but ultimately saying nothing', much like Sam Elliott's mysterious Stranger's priceless rambling of a narration. One almost dares to believe that the Coens' true joke is all of the speculation, controversy, debates over the film and religions derived from it being ultimately unwarranted, as the film was crafted with no such motivations, or ultimately any motivations at all. And ultimately, perhaps the most poignant point that can be extracted from the film is that it doesn't need a point, as entertaining as it can be to try to impose meaning on the strange and hilarious string of events passed off as a narrative. The film functions beautifully simply as a chance to hang out with some lovable, hilarious and very memorable characters, to experience the thrill of a mystery haphazardly investigated (with the viewer continually left as befuddled as the characters), to listen to some great music and to ultimately learn, much like The Dude, to simply accept the absurdity of it all and simply exist and try to get through. And again, whether such an absence of point is truly the most satisfying explanation of the film remains a moot point – no matter what lens the film is examined through, it has never been so enjoyable to enter the gleefully odd, remarkably stylized world of the Coen brothers and simply exist.But the film's true joy lies in its collection of eccentric characters and equally off-the-wall performances. Jeff Bridges has never been better, inhabiting the laid back, drugged up and haphazardly heroic role of The Dude with an uncanny ease and magnificent comedic timing – a perpetually watchable triumph of characterization. Consistent scene-stealer John Goodman is equally priceless as faux-Jewish, rage-filled Vietnam veteran Walter Sobchak, a bellowing, stubbornly illogical yet strangely lovable satire of the crass yet well intentioned Western stereotype. Julianne Moore similarly generates a performance which is outlandish, flat out hilarious and hits perhaps a little too close to home as an absurdist feminist visual artist. David Huddleston rants, raves, screeches and bellows to sublime comedic effect as the titular industrialist The Big Lebowski, and Steve Buscemi transforms clueless yet lovable into a work of art as the continually ""out of his element"" Donny. But sheer magic can be found just as much in the supporting cast, with Philip Seymour Hoffman as obsessively prissy personal assistant Brandt, John Turturro as grotesque, purple spandex-clad, gyrating, former pedophile bowler Jesus Quintana, Peter Stormare as a deadpan nihilist porn star and Tara Reid as the compulsively greedy and promiscuous Bunny Lebowski along with the innumerable supporting bit parts each demonstrating exquisitely inventive and staggeringly funny characterizations, all excelling during their respective moments to shine.Without question the film will not prove fitting for all tastes, and complaints have been raised of its being self-indulgently alienating and strange, overlong and aimlessly rambling. Yet for those generally attuned to the Coens' incomparably oddball frequency, The Big Lebowski proves about as inventive, fresh, compelling and insanely comical (as well as potentially thematically provocative) as a film can get, and even the articulated complaints against it somehow manage to work more in its favour than detrimentally. One of the few films which visibly improves from an already high standard upon each viewing, The Big Lebowski remains a cinematic comedy masterpiece. And yes, the Dude abides.-10/10",The Big Lebowski
116,oneguyrambling,"So a Jew, an annoying guy and a Dude walk into a bowling alley...",9,23 July 2011,"So there's this dude who lives in LA – wait – not ""this dude"", ""The Dude""The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a bearded slob. His casual hippie-esque drawl is peppered with profanity and he calls almost everyone he meets, male or female: ""Man"". When ""dressed up"" he might wear a t-shirt and shorts, this is not often. Standard attire is an open robe and slippers.The Dude hasn't worked for some time and he lives a simple, meagre existence in rented accommodation with few friends. His only non-negotiables are bowling and White Russians, an alcoholic beverage.The Dudes only known friends are his bowling buddies, members of a league team, a league that they take extremely seriously. (There are many scenes in this film set in the bowling alley during play, however we only see one of the team ever bowl, three bowls from memory.) Speaking of the team, aside from The Dude we have Walter (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi).Walter is loud, opinionated and obnoxious, not exactly a winning combination, but he is loyal to The Dude and even though he frequently gets it wrong he seems to want to do the right thing. He treats Donnie with disdain and almost always brings everything back to a Nam story.Donnie is the opposite, simple, friendly and curious, he is always questioning and inserting randomly pointless comments into proceedings (""I am the Walrus"").The fun starts with a case of mistaken identity, a message made for a Lebowski is served to the wrong Lebowski being The Dude's AKA, this leads him in turn to the right Lebowski, specifically the Big Lebowski for a chat.The chain of linked but totally unpredictable events that follows this simple mistake are realistically largely irrelevant to your enjoyment, aside from facilitating the introduction of various characters and providing The Dude and often Walter with a purpose for a short time. The convoluted plot is often broken up with insane yet totally entertaining dream sequences, generally bowling related and short sequences involving red herrings and bit characters, not the least of which is named The Jesus.Highlights though include:A ransom request leading to a botched payoff. - German nihilist pornographers - An inconvenient stolen car - A freaky naked feminist who paints via flying fox - A moustachioed cowboy narratorThe banter is often hilarious (and always profane), the ridiculous situations are often hard to follow but this never seems to matter anyway, and the cameos and brief go-nowhere scenes make the film even better (More highlights? ""Nobody f*cks wit De Jesus!"", The Dude's use of spy techniques at the home of the Pornographer brings hilarious results that are not what The Dude – or anyone would expect.)Though you will be relieved to know that come the conclusion of the film the bowling team does make it to the finals or maybe that was a spoiler?Final Rating – 8 / 10. Never has a throwaway film been this indisposable. Apparently this is a ""Ya get it or ya don't"" film, I myself can't see why ya wouldn't wanna get it.",The Big Lebowski

118,xredgarnetx,Fun for the guys,6,12 November 2007,"I am one of those who think the Coen Brothers have done better movies than THE BIG LEBOWSKI. But I will give it this: This satiric tale of mistaken identity, kidnap and death has a Raymond Chandler-esquire feel that should certainly appeal to male viewers. Jeff Bridges is Dude Lebowski, who ends up being mixed up with a millionaire with the same last name (David Huddleston) who owes money to some very bad men. The Dude's best buddy, Walter (John Goodman) helps The Dude in his quest to find the senior Lebowski's hormone-crazed child bride (Tara Reid), who has done a disappearing act and may or may not have been kidnapped. The film is bizarre, to say the least, with Busby Berkley-type fantasy sequences, Bridges as a '60s burnout with long, unkempt hair and Goodman as an individual with serious anger management issues. Bridges and Goodman make the film worth watching, although their constant use of expletives may turn off some. They are supported in their efforts by Steve Buscemi as their strange pal Donny and Julianne Moore as the even stranger Maude Lebowski. Sam Elliott serves as the film's narrator and shows up in a brief sequence. This is quite probably Goodman's finest film, by the way.",The Big Lebowski

120,bobsgrock,Completely original and unforgettable.,9,26 December 2009,"There never was before and there probably never will be a film quite like The Big Lebowski. It has a typical film noir story arc mixed with a couple of stoner characters and a hip setting in the early 1990s Los Angeles that creates a great atmosphere to watch the action unfold. This is Raymond Chandler on vacation; relaxed and willing to stretch out and let loose.When it first premiered, this was quite a misunderstood movie. People couldn't believe that this was written, produced and directed by the same team who made that brilliant crime thriller Fargo from two years before. Yet, this kind of movie shows how creative and daring the Coen brothers are. They don't try to make just one kind of film; they branch out and try different ideas until they hit upon one that works. And they had to know from the start that a character like the Dude would work. With the wonderfully laid back Jeff Bridges in the title role, the Dude abides as one of the greatest of all movie characters, perhaps the Coens have ever written and one that will be remembered for ages.Of course, where would the Dude be without his able partner, Walter Sobchak, that Vietnam-crazy, screaming Jew who takes his bowling almost as serious as his religion. John Goodman gives perhaps his most memorable performance and it is a great one; thoroughly entertaining as well as very funny. And then there is Donny, played with sweet naiveté by Steve Buscemi. Donny doesn't do or say much, but I think he represents the audience; just there for the ride and seeing the story unfold only because he enjoys the company of the Dude and Walter despite his constant yelling at him.This is a movie that could be discussed and analyzed forever in terms of its plot, dream sequences and ways it adheres to old-fashion storytelling with modern film making. But perhaps the Coens simply wanted it enjoyed on its most basic level; as the story of a man called Dude who had his rug peed on and sought destitute for it. And that is because that rug really tied the room together. This is a completely original and unforgettable movie that must be seen by any Coen brothers or modern movie fan.",The Big Lebowski

123,TheUnknown837-1,Obnoxious characters swamped in a story that is much too pretentious and complicated for its own good,5,9 March 2012,"Here are the highlights of ""The Big Lebowski."" The opening scene with Jeff Bridges, as a never-do-well being comically ambushed by two men in his home, one of whom urinates on his living room rug. Mr. Bridges again, dropping a joint on his crotch while he's driving and careening into a trash can. Mr. Bridges yet again babbling absolute nonsense, trying to fake his way out of a jam. Mr. Bridges, yes he, being bonked in the head with a ceramic mug.You would think that these moments, coupled with the fact that Mr. Bridges plays the lead, would make ""The Big Lebowski"" a deliriously funny comedy. But alas, it's just valiantly unsuccessful. For Mr. Bridges is far more interesting than the dopey character that's been written for him by his directors, the much-lauded Joel and Ethan Coen. And those highlights were predominantly jabs of slapstick: the only truly funny moments in the film, much more than the pseudo-insights of American culture and pornography. Another great moment, this one featuring John Goodman, has him bashing up a would-be perpetrator's car with a crowbar, only to have a neighbor (the real owner of the car) come screaming out of the house, taking the crowbar, and bashing in Mr. Bridges's car instead.In other words, when the writer/directors go for simplistic and old-fashioned slapstick, coupled with their terrific wide-screen techniques and misc en scene, really works. It's the rest of their pretentious sense of humor that does not work. For once again, they have nose-dived into a pool of complexity, stretching out for something they don't quite have the understanding to reach. They have the ideas; what they lack is the patience to compose it in a way that not only communicates their ideas to the audience, but make it fascinating at the same time. For example, they add some pornographic subtext to the game of bowling (they might just be the only filmmakers to ever do that) but what exactly it means comes up very fuzzily. As is the show-stopping moment where Mr. Bridges goes into a drug-induced hallucination with him and Julianne Moore in an unnervingly peculiar bowling/sex extravaganza. What exactly, do I mean? I'm not sure, and I am not about to watch the film a second time, because it had me restless thirty minutes in.Mr. Bridges does a nice enough job playing a character so sloppy and whiny that it borders on the ridiculous. And not in a good way. It's funny to have him cry out ""I'm the Dude!"" the first few times, but when it happens again and again for two hours, it really wears thin. As does John Goodman screaming at Steve Buscemi ""Shut the (expletive) up, Donny!"" Speaking of Mr. Goodman, he pours a lot of energy into his role, and I guess I cannot honestly say his performance is bad, but it became tiring seeing him on-camera after a while. The fault lies in the character, who is much too obnoxious and redundant to be funny. Mr. Buscemi gives a much more likable performance for a much more likable character, but is hardly on screen. How sad is that? Well, not his denouement.Surround these characters with a lumpy story far too complicated for its own good and you've got a dull picture. ""The Big Lebowski"" is clearly aiming to make commentaries of such, as demonstrated by Sam Elliott's out-of-the-blue appearances here and there in the picture, but they become lost in a pretentiously muddled screenplay.The Coen brothers are good directors. They have great craftsmanship. A key moment is when the camera takes a bowling ball's point-of-view as it thunders down a lane. Slow-motion shots of the pins scattering, though gimmicky and seen before, are also fun to look at. So they can direct; they have talent! Immense talent. But they really do need to hire somebody to rework their screenplays, for that is where they fall short more often than not. Come the end of ""The Big Lebowski,"" I was not pondering over what Sam Elliott had just said in his closing speech, and what it had to do with all that happened in the two hours before, but instead, this.In the scene where Mr. Bridges and Mr. Goodman are having a would-be sentimental moment by the ocean, who was that character I saw walking on the hill crest in the top-right section of the screen?",The Big Lebowski
124,baumer,Shut the **** up Donny!,9,24 June 1999,"I have honestly never seen a film like the Big Lebowski before.  Just like I have never seen a film like Fargo before.  Both were done by the Coen brothers and both were funny and strange at the same time.  And both had roles in them for Steve Buscemi, who can make a good film great, a bad film good and a weird film watchable.I can't say I loved this film even though I'm giving it an 8 out of 10. But what I can say is that I really liked it.  John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are so funny in this film.  Goodman has issues.  That's for sure.  He has many issues that he is dealing with.  But instead of dealing with them like a scarred Vet usually does, he deals with them in anger but a funny anger if that is possible.  He lashes out at his friends especially Donny who just doesn't seem to say any of the right things when Goodman is around.Bridges is excellent as well.  His character really just wants to get through the day and bowl and not have anyone pee on his carpet.  But of course none of that is going to happen in the strange world that the Coen's have created.What is not so great about this film is all the dream sequences.  They are confusing and they don't hit the right note.  They feel more like a nuisance.But this is a film that should be experienced.  It is at least original and it is worth a few laughs.",The Big Lebowski
125,mattymatt4ever,Outstanding!!! Very very funny!!!,8,5 April 2001,"There are so many movies that lack in originality, and there are so many comedies that fall flat.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is like an answer to my prayers.  This is a comedy that works in ALL aspects.  Sometimes you have a comedy that's funny, but the writing's terrible and the talented cast is pretty much the only asset that keeps it moving.  This movie not only has a great cast, but it's wonderfully written (by those genius Coen Brothers), lavishly directed and contains a remarkable soundtrack.  Each and every character has a quirky, notable personality.  My favorite, though he only appeared on screen for about 5 minutes, was Jesus Quintana (played masterfully by John Turturro).  He cracked me up so hard!!!  And I love that scene where Jesus goes up to bowl, licks the ball for good luck and we watch in slow-motion as he hits a strike.  He dances in the lane and rejoices, while we hear a Mariachi version of the famous ""Hotel California"" in the background.  Only the Coen Brothers can make a scene work that smoothly. There are other memorable sequences, like the musical number called ""Gutterballs"" with Jeff Bridges being handed a pair of bowling shoes by Sadam Hussein and flying under the skirts of beautiful women.  You watch a scene like that, and you wonder why this movie didn't nab an Oscar for Best Art Direction.      Ethan and Joel Coen have a great sense of originality, and that also showed in their other hilarious comedy, ""Raising Arizona.""  I loved that movie, too.  But I loved this movie twice as much.  Some won't approve of its maximum dosage of ""f"" words, but I was laughing so hard that didn't bother me one bit.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is one of those flicks that shows you what comedy is all about, and how to really form a good punchline with perfect timing and delivery.  As a bonus, the film is packed with stunning visuals. It's such a great movie to look at.  There are no cheap shots in this one. The dialogue is imaginative, yet realistic.  It's not the least bit pretentious.  You know, as you watch this, that this IS the way people talk. And that was also shown in ""Fargo.""  And I liked that even though the central character was a simple-minded individual, they didn't construct him like someone out of a ""Bill and Ted"" movie.  Jeff Bridges, who is perfectly cast, was extremely entertaining and I can say the same about John Goodman as his easily-angered friend who follows all the Jewish holidays even though he's not Jewish.  I find it a tad appalling that critics have panned this movie and called it slight and forgettable.  This is more intelligent than most comedies in recent years--or any year.  This is a very, very entertaining movie and if you really want to laugh--this is DEFINITELY the movie to see!!!",The Big Lebowski

127,sharky_55,The Dude Abides,9,27 October 2015,"The Big Lebowski starts and ends with narrative voice-over, which seems to be out of place. A well-moustached stranger with a cowboy hat chronicles mysteriously and tenderly a tale for the times, and tumbleweed blows through not great lonely western plains, but down- town Los Angeles. Yes, the City of Angels itself, but the glitter is often substituted for the gritty in those noir detective works. The Texan acts as a filter; he doesn't approve of the Dude's profanity or laziness, but then again, isn't the hero of these stories supposed to be a morally ambiguous figure? This is not the Golden Age of detective novels. The Coens throw Bridges knee deep into this love letter of sorts to the great noirs. It is set in urban California much like The Big Sleep, but the Dude is not the hard-boiled detective, harbouring darks thoughts and living endlessly on a cigarette. He is unemployed, dressed in a bathrobe instead of a trenchcoat, and lives on White Russians and pot. There is a clever shot where he contemplates himself in the mirror of a TIME cover. The whole narrative is set into motion not by his own motivations, but by the bickering of his best friend Walter. John Goodman plays the impulsive live-wire veteran, who has the ability to spin any conversation into one concerning war, patriotism and freedom; Donny's eulogy is sorely lacking. The trio lovingly frequent a bowling alley which houses an assortment of plucky figures, instead of a seedy and neon-defaced bar which spits out slow jazz. When a gun gets pulled out, or any sort of violence whatsoever, the Dude protests. When he is confronted by the bizarre bowling rival/sex offender in Jesus, he has no witty comeback but manages to mumble out one of his classic lines. We delve into deeper mysteries. A rogue phone-call leads Lebowski to the film's femme fatale as he meanders up a dark alleyway. She is given an apt introduction, swinging wildly as she dabbles in abstract erotic art and speaks pointedly about gender truths in a British accent. As tradition states, they sleep together, but it isn't the desperate romantic affair we expect. Later, Lebowski follows up on another lead on a well-dressed and spoken millionaire (that is to say, he is hauled there against his will), and the architecture is sleek, modern, intimidating. The Dude lounges with his White Russian. The Coens question the genre with every turn. We have strange characters like Maude's sophisticated bald friend, who laughs with high pitched derision but does not harbour evil plans. A covert car follows him around the film, and ends up being a rather nervous private investigator who is thrilled to meet another PI of such great talent and ability (which speaks about his own competence). The Dude is bamboozled with over-elaborate demands in a increasingly complex and twisted kidnapping plot, and fails to complete any of them. In a rare instance where he takes action, the camera eagerly zooms upon a hastily written and cryptic message. The Coens parody a similar scene in Hitchcock's North by Northwest here, but the Dude finds not a vital clue, but a crude drawing of an erection. The opening credits lovingly detail the bowling alley and all its regulars to the tune of Bob Dylan. There are other dream-like sequences which increasingly up the chaos, and in another film they might lead to some sort of bigger picture or unearth some grand conspiracy, but here it just leads to more profanity-laden demands for explanation. They are stylised with great care and hint at the noir influence, but perhaps through the lens of the Dude's stoner lifestyle; being crushed by a giant bowling ball which spins in a dizzying POV, running raggedly in the night while being backlit by police cars, and an elaborate interpretive dance number set to the counter-culture tune Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In). Elsewhere Maude romantically confronts the hero of the story by looking down at him and upside down in a moment of incompetence, friends encounter a piece of 'culture' at the dance recital (but how loyal is the Dude!), and in a scarce moment of clarity and realisation, the Holmes figure reveals all via a dramatic flashback which visualises the murky millionaire figure in ominous shadows and a lightning storm. Of course, the essence of film noir is that our characters are trapped within a world of chaos and moral greys and indifference, only here our hero is beyond ordinary, and somehow stumbles upon the right answer despite his incompetence and laid-back approach. It is here that Coens extract much of the humour. Bridges stutters his way through an explanation of why he has neither ransom nor kidnappee. He crudely constructs a device to stop the frequent intrusions, only to have the door open the other way, and then later trips on the plank himself. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as a spineless and obedient servant who lavishes praise upon his master and echoes his sentiments in a very moderate manner. A little boy is remarkably stone faced, and Walter, who takes every transgression as an affront on himself and America, over-reacts in the most hilarious way, and is shocked to find he has targeted the wrong car. Later he attempts to unveil a conspiracy, but ends up dumping a disabled man onto the floor. And in that climatic 'fight', a bowling ball is substitute for a mace and Donny dies of a heart attack, his ashes blowing in the wind, and the Dude's face. Next week he goes bowling, and forgets about the whole affair. You know, strikes and gutters.",The Big Lebowski
128,Stampsfightclub,Stunning and bizarre drama with the best fantasies ever made,8,26 August 2008,"Jeff Bridges (The fabulous baker boys) stars as the Dude Lebowski, who is mistaken for another Lebowski, which ultimately leaves his rug ruined. Taking this up with the Big Lebowski, the Dude is sent on a mission to recover his kidnapped wife.The Big Lebowski is one of the Coen brother's finest creations by being different, funny and entertaining all the way through with smart direction and acting.You will have never seen anything like this before as Jeff Bridges gives an unbelievable performance as The Dude, an unemployed bum who likes white Russians and bowling who seeks a very bizarre retribution in his ruined rug.The ideology of the rug and the whole obsessive nature behind it is very funny, as is Bridges in a very weird character, which is lovable for being so hip, and relaxed.Though his character can be extremely rude and annoying, John Goodman (Roseanne) plays Walter extremely well and makes an interesting paring alongside the Dude.The plot is excellent and very consistent. Very character driven, The Big Lebowski packs in plenty of laughs along the way with some breathtaking twists and turns and strong ideologies to keep it entertaining.One particular factor which helped the film along, was the beautifully directed bowling scene fantasies, so bizarre and unique that the film is a must watch just for these couple of moments of pure genius. They are so out of place in the film, so wacky that it is pure amazement.Forget J.D's fantasies in Scrubs, we have the funniest and wackiest fantasies right here in a completely twisting and turning storyline.Come the end of the film, you may have lost your way a bit as to what happens with all the money dealings and who all the characters were and so forth, but you will definitely not mind watching again, as you will have seen the most coolest Dude in the history of cinema in a very finely directed comedy drama.",The Big Lebowski
129,TOMASBBloodhound,"Suspicions confirmed, unfortunately.",6,20 November 2008,"There is a youtube.com video somebody laboriously strung together of all the numerous eff-words in this movie and the order in which they appear. The thing goes on for at least two full minutes. And it is very, very funny. Trouble is, the entire movie is little more amusing than this little clip. Only it lasts much longer. Too long, in fact. For years I had put off watching The Big Lebowski. After seeing various snippets of it, I began to develop suspicions that the entire ordeal might not be worth the time to watch it. Unfortunately, my suspicions were confirmed after a recent viewing of the whole thing.The story, and I use the word ""story"" loosely, deals with an ex-hippie loser trying to get revenge and restitution from those who urinated on a rug in his tiny apartment. A case of mistaken identity causes Jeff Lebowski to be assaulted by goons in an early scene, and his home and possessions violated. Lebowski, played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges, has been mistaken for a seemingly wealthy man and he feels that the real target of the assault at least owes him for the rug. Lebowski goes to the man's mansion to ask for restitution, but ends up getting involved in a kidnapping scheme involving the man's trophy wife. Nothing else must be said about the plot. You just have to sit back an experience the rest. My guess is that many people, whether they will admit it or not, may find this movie a tad bit tedious. Yes, it is full of talented and funny actors, and yes it was made by the Coen brothers. But the plot involving nihilists, hit men, eccentric performance artists, bowling alleys, and god knows whatever else is just too much to take in one dosage. My guess is the Coens were just bound and determined to tell some kind of story about ""The Dude"", and the plot of that story was ultimately inconsequential to the actual act of telling his story.As mentioned earlier, Bridges is pretty funny as ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski. This is one of those roles an actor doesn't have to do a lot for. No trips to the gym, no chiseled abs like in Against All Odds. Heck, he even used some of his own clothes. The rest of the cast is pretty good, too. They just aren't always sure how best to use them. If anyone out there doesn't know who John Millius is, trust me... John Goodman nailed him. Tara Reid ten years later seems like a casting mistake though. Back then I guess someone thought she had talent.The Coens are living gods in the minds of many. For my money, they are pretty hit and miss. They've given us duds like O Brother Where Art Thou, and the Ladykillers. Little gems like Raising Arizona. Stellar efforts like Fargo. And maybe the best film I've ever seen, No Country for Old Men. But The Big Lebowski is a slight miss for them. If you like it, then I guess The Hound abides but can only give it 6 of 10 stars himself.",The Big Lebowski
130,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Another Coen Brothers cult classic.,8,2 September 2021,"In the last year or so, I've tried to watch a few cult classics that had escaped my purview. I'm familiar with their cultural significance, and I can understand why they are beloved by many, but they aren't necessarily perfect films by any means. Movies like The Goonies (1985) and Mean Girls (2004) are mostly known via their memeable moments. This was why I already understood the gist of these movies before actually sitting down and watching them. The Big Lebowski (1998) was yet another cult classic that had these same strengths and weaknesses.First off, Jeff Bridges is ""The Dude."" If he didn't provide such a solid performance, I doubt this movie would have become nearly as memorable. However, what people might forget about this film is how weird it is. Many sequences left me scratching my head and wondering what the heck was going on. And perhaps it's this kind of ""stoner appeal"" that led it into its cult status. Then again, I have to remind myself that the Coen Brothers toe that line between serious drama (Fargo (1996), No Country for Old Men (2007), and True Grit (2010)) and comedy (The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), Burn After Reading (2008), and Hail, Caesar! (2016)).Of course, the comedy the Coen Brothers bring to the table is definitely of the dark variety, and The Big Lebowski has enough of it sprinkled throughout its plot that you have no doubt it's a Coen Brothers movie. And while it's fun watching The Dude piece together the predicament he finds himself in, the plot pivots and turns so hard and fast that it's hard to keep up at times. Ultimately, The Big Lebowski is an entertaining film and probably contributed to an increase of people ordering White Russians at bars for years to come.Another Coen Brothers cult classic, I give The Big Lebowski 4.0 stars out of 5.",The Big Lebowski

Jeff Bridges stars as Jeffrey Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker and avid bowler, who refers to himself as ""The Dude"".The Big Lebowski is a wide-eyed, one-of-a-kind comedy of genius, with the structure of a shaggy-dog Raymond Chandler pastiche. No surprise that it has ripened over the years and became a beloved cult favourite (""the first cult film of the Internet era""): it is the Coen Brothers' most exuberantly wacky and inventive film, but also their most affectionate and the performances are a joy.

You Pulp Fiction was about nothing, but it was interesting nothing, whereas this is about really nothing and it sucks at it. This film is neither funny, nor exciting, nor anything that represents a state of entertainment. This film sucks. I'll never understand it's rating a 7,7 ????!!!!. I think the reason for the rating is that it was made by the Coen brothers. Why they get so much good ratings for their films? Hell I don't know. I though this was crap. Fargo was only average.

133,tbills2,The Dude sure does rule,9,30 April 2013,"The Big Lebowski is a laugh-out-loud comedy, one of the all-time greats. While it may not be so uproarious as other comedy classics like Caddyshack or Dumb & Dumber, one thing distinguishes it from the lot making it special, it's actually good. It's a good movie. It is good in the dramatic sense. That puts it in rare company with flicks such as Raising Arizona. If there were only some link tying those two...Oh! The Coen Brothers! What a coincidence, these fellows are unbelievable! Someone might consider giving these two an award or some sort of a commemorative plaque. Ethan and Joel know their stuff. Watching The Big Lebowski and expecting a workable storyline or plausible happenings would be missing the point entirely. The true splendor of this film lies in the viewing ebbs and flows, the sweet spiritual journey endured, dipping into a tranquil pool of camaraderie and tolerance while emerging a cooler, wiser person. The Big Lebowski is fully enriched with life-learning moments. Take it from The Stranger if not from me. Sam Elliot's narration is great. The pacing of the film is precise. The writing of dialogue and the characters themselves are stupendous. The acting is first rate. Jeff Bridges gets the role of a lifetime playing The Dude. John Goodman is unforgettable as Walter. John Turturro as Jesus is so funny. The enjoyable experience of The Big Lebowski is simply lovely.""Take 'er easy, Dude. I know that you will.""",The Big Lebowski
134,ajs-10,Almost perfect from the Coen Brothers...,9,29 August 2010,"I'll admit I am a big fan of this film; I've loved it since I first saw it on a grainy rental video back in 2000. To me the Coen brothers have made two outstanding films, this one and Fargo (1996), and yes, I know there will be some disagreement out there about that, but it's only my opinion. Now, before I tell you why I think this is such a great film, here's a little bit about the plot.Jeffrey Lebowski (a.k.a. The Dude), is disturbed one evening when two heavies break into his house and demand money that his wife owes their boss. One of them urinates on his rug before they realise they have the wrong Lebowski This one isn't even married. The next day The Dude complains about this to his bowling buddies, Walter Sobchak and Donny Kerabatsos. They figure out it's a case of mistaken identity and The Dude goes to see the man they really wanted, another Jeffrey Lebowski - The Big Lebowski, who happens to be a millionaire. Leaving with a replacement rug, The Dude meets the young trophy wife, Bunny Lebowski. A few days later he is contacted by Mr Lebowski's assistant, Brandt, because Bunny has been kidnapped and they want The Dude to act as the bag man. I won't say any more, but that's basically the set-up. Throw in The Big Lebowski's artist daughter Maude (from a previous marriage) and some crazy German nihilists and you can see there's plenty to keep the audience amused and entertained.This is an exceptionally well made film with a great cast, a great score and some really different and enthralling dream sequences thrown in. To me it's almost the perfect movie, I say almost, because I like to leave a little margin for improvement. Great performances all round from; Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowski - The Dude, John Goodman as Walter Sobchak, Julianne Moore as Maude Lebowski, Steve Buscemi as Donny Kerabatsos, David Huddleston as Jeffrey Lebowski - The Big Lebowski, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Brandt and Tara Reid as Bunny Lebowski. Oh, and I almost forgot a stellar performance by John Turturro as Jesus Quintana.As I've already said, this is, to me, almost the perfect movie. I say that because I can only find one scene that doesn't add anything substantial to the story. It's the one where The Dude confronts the guy in the VW Beetle (for those that have seen it). Apart from that, an almost perfect movie. Very highly recommended.My score: 9.3/10",The Big Lebowski

136,FilmOtaku,A Hilarious Offering From the Coen Brothers,9,8 August 2003,"There are very few comedies made after 1960 that can make me chuckle, much less laugh out loud but The Big Lebowski is one of them.  While I've owned the DVD and have seen this film many times I was able to catch a midnight showing last week at a local art house theater, and it was a hilarious experience.  The high hilarity was enhanced by the crowd literally chanting the lines (or that could have been the White Russians we all drank were flowing as freely as water), and the audience's obvious appreciation for this clever film.While the Coen Brothers deserve a lot of the credit for the direction and the brilliant script, a special mention should be made regarding the performances.  I would say that Jeff Bridges completely breaks from his `regular guy' type roles, but Lebowski *is* a regular guy, if you are a pot smoking, unambitious shlub.  Both Bridges and John Goodman turn out performances that are so colorful and hilarious that their mere presence on the screen sparks laughter.  The always fantastic Steve Buscemi also joins Goodman as a Coen Brothers repeat performer, and carries on the typical `Buscemi Coen Brother Character fate'.  This is a hilarious, surreal and brilliant film that should not be missed, especially if you are a fan of the Coen Brothers' work.  It has been criticized by die hard fans and others for not falling into their typical genre, but all of the elements are the same, and while for me choosing a favorite Coen Brothers film is like choosing which child is one's favorite (it can't be done!) this is definitely one that I can watch repeatedly and not have it lose any of it's charm.--Shelly",The Big Lebowski
137,Pedro_H,Top class black comedy - the stuff cults are made of!,7,13 April 2004,"One Roger Lebowski is a slow-witted LA waster who spends most of his days in a drug induced haze and lives in a low rent apartment. Another is a rich businessman with a wayward trophy wife and who lives in a mansion. Witless debt collectors mistake one for the other and start a chain of funny, off-beat and intriguing events.The Coen Brothers are simply not capable of making a bad movie, they couldn't do so even if they tried. They are masters of taking things just far enough to be strange and off-beat and yet not let it all fall apart completely. Something that David Lynch should learn from. Even if you are not taken by the plot they throw so many extras at you that you can just enjoy the productions for those alone.This is something of crossbreed movie. Indeed it takes from Raymond Chandler to the Odd Couple stopping off at Pulp Fiction. Star turn is not Jeff Bridges (hippie Lebowski), but his bowling buddy John Goodman who puts in an amazing performance as a damaged and deranged Vietnam vet and some of his lines are laugh out loud funny - especially how he deals with a fellow bowler who has ""stepped over the line."" A little scene that stands up to the best of the funny business in Pulp Fiction.Maybe if you want to be harsh they do turn this in to a bit of a variety show that goes from the bowling alley small-talk, to surreal dreams scenes, to the tale of a how a pair of dimwits try to dig themselves out of a hole. Four letter words come thick and fast and you wonder whether we really need them. This is - after all - a silly comedy. Why cut off part of the audience? Equally why is Roger (the dim one) only called The Dude throughout and never by his first name? Good entertainment and sure to become a cult - if it is not already.",The Big Lebowski

This movie is just perfect with outstanding writing from the cohen brothers who always find new ways to make interesting stories and quirky fun characters. With all the actors doing such a bang up belieavle job this movie does everything right.This movie is about jeffery lebowski (everyone calls the dude) (Bridges) an unemployed loser who does nothing pretty much other then bowl. One night two young thugs bust into his place thinking he was a million of the same name. After figuring out he wasn't they peed on his rug and took off. So the dude went to the million for compensation for his rug but when he gets there the old millionaire has a proposistion for him.This movie was just so good.

His rug is ruined so he get's the help of his bowling buddies an insane Vietnam Veteran named Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and the Dude's other friend Donny Kerabotsos (Steve Buscemi) to get his ruined rug back. An innumerable number of subplots, a boatload of swearing, and some great lines are what make this film more then worthwhile. This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and everything revolves around the Dude. The Dude is a character who has accomplished very little, and does very little, but he seems to have managed himself a very happy life. And that's what really holds together. Everything (as funny as it may be) could have been left out but what you can't take out is the Dude himself. His reactions and way of doing things is what makes this worthwhile.

141,AhmedSpielberg99,He's The Dude man!,8,21 March 2018,"The story's message is very simple as in all Coen Brothers' movies, 
the symbolism is so subtle and exquisite as in all Coen Brothers' movies, and every character with or without an arc or a sub-plot has a thing to do in the movie's plot or at least make you appreciate the movie even more than you do, but despite all that the redundancy of using the allegory by using many characters and sub-plots with the fast pacing could make you feel the movie's story is very sophisticated and convoluted even it's not. Also, I found some characters haven't been merged well with the plot (even they are very meaningful like the rest of the characters as I said). That being said, these issues didn't bother me at all as I was so invested in each character and I really enjoyed every second in the movie.Jeff Bridges maybe give the best performance in his career. It's really a shame he didn't get an Oscar nomination for his vivid and stellar performance in The Big Lebowski. 
John Goodman was great, and he had a wonderful chemistry with Steve Buscemi as well as with Jeff Bridges.
Philip Seymour Hoffman didn't have a lot of time on the screen but he was so hilarious.Roger Deakins did an awesome job as usual and crafted not just a beautiful cinematography but also a very smart and shiny one that has aged (and will age) very well.The soundtrack maybe is one of the best soundtracks ever put to movie.

Above par upon first viewing, but the replay value is unmatchable and will eventually wind up at the top of your favorite comedies.

The script is tight and flows well, the direction is solid and the actors do their damned best as they should. This ends up with one of the funniest comedies I've seen in ages: Witty, surprising, odd and all around plain awesome. There isn't a single actor in the film, that would do a sub par delivery in the story and all the pieces clash nicely together while the bizarre tale of bowling and betrayal unfolds before the viewers eyes.I can't do nothing else but to recommend this, as this is one of those films, that will last time more than a week or two.

The more that I think about the character Jeff Lebowski, the more I envy him. He's so cool. What a role model. He goes to stores in his robe, everyone refers to him as ""The Dude"", he bowls, he's funny. He's awesome.He's the coolest role model alive. And what makes The Cohen brother's film, The Big Lebowski, so enjoyable, is the way Jeff Bridges portrays Jeff Lebowski. To be honest, I think Bridges deserved the Oscar, not only for Crazy heart, but for The big Lebowski.Jeff Lebowski and his friends(Steve Buschemi and John Goodman) are frequent bowlers. Lebowski's life is turned upside down after his mistaken for another Lebowski, who is the opposite, a millionaire. Two guys break into ""The Dude's"" house and pee on his rug.""The Dude"" goes to the other Lebowski and forces him to pay for his rug.

Jeff meets The other Leboski's daughter(Julianne Moore) who is involved in porn, and he gets into mishaps with some Germans.The Big Lebowski is hilarious,well acted,and engrossing. The Dude is such a likable character. The film is made in a style that I can't even describe. I laughed so many times, from Jeff Bridges' screams, to the rest of the movie.

145,Blue-Grotto,Time and Place for Everyone; Even the Dude,10,8 March 2018,"Intruders break into the modest Los Angeles apartment of Jeff ""the Dude"" Lebowski. He is roughed up, money is demanded of him that he does not have, his head is unceremoniously swirled in the toilet and the toughs threaten to return, but they have the wrong Lebowski! This simple case of mistaken identity leads to a comedy of errors involving a kidnapping, a million-dollar ransom, Jesus in a purple bowling suit, a duffel bag full of dirty undies, an attack ferret and even a spicy bowling themed dream sequence. The Dude is inept, lazy and hopeless, but there is a time and place for everyone. He is in way over his head, yet so is everyone else.
 
20 years after its release and the film still one of my all-time favorites. It was my first Coen brothers film. Their brilliance and originality is instantly recognizable. The story and characters are full of delightful depth and details, the writing is witty and consistently dazzling, there is never a dull moment, and on top of everything it is really, really funny. At times I could hardly breath I was laughing so hard. Among such moments is the confrontation with the ferret, the parking lot skirmish heart attack and the bowling rants and taunts of Jesus.
 
Finding balance is one thing the Coen brothers excel at. Each character has offsetting strengths and weaknesses, every setting is shown in wondrous light as well as the shadows, and nothing is beyond reproach. No one and nothing is put on a pedestal, or trashed without a fair fight. The casting of Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Turturro is brilliant. The Coens have such amazing insight into the American character; rich and poor, country and city, women and men, and cultured or not. They cut across boundaries, religions, philosophies, regions and political persuasions, and they do it seamlessly and randomly as a tumbling tumbleweed and as unlikely as a bowling alley prophet!",The Big Lebowski
146,Dan1863Sickles,Among The Greatest of American Comedies,9,22 October 2015,"To me, the three funniest American movies ever made are A NIGHT AT THE OPERA, YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, and THE BIG LEBOWSKI.It's really interesting to notice the similarities between the three movies. YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN is a spoof of classic horror movies from the thirties. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is a spoof of classic detective movies from the thirties and forties. Both movies totally capture the feel of the original genre and feel authentic even when being deliberately funny. The Dude is a lot like the Monster, a slow and clumsy but basically good-hearted character who spends most of the movie stumbling around not quite knowing what is going on, while the hysterical characters all around him create bizarre complications. Also, notice that both YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN and THE BIG LEBOWSKI feature show-stopping musical numbers, each of which come out of nowhere and feature the rumpled, clumsy main character suddenly recast as a dapper song and dance man. ""Puttin' On the Ritz"" and ""Just Stopped In (To See What Condition My Condition Is In"") are both numbers that take an already successful comedy and push it into the realm of a total classic. A lot of the humor in THE BIG LEBOWSKI parallels the humor of A NIGHT AT THE OPERA. In both movies, wealthy society people attempt to boss around deadbeats and eccentrics, who soon turn the tables and create all kinds of mischief. Maude Lebowski, with her artistic tastes, cheerful snobbery, and fundamentally gullible nature, is a perfect update of the well-to-do women Margaret Dumont always played in the Marx Brothers classic comedies. The difference is that Maude is never, ever reduced to the role of a simple straight man (or woman.) Indeed, her wit is often a lot sharper than the Dude's. (""The dialog is inane, and the plot ludicrous . . . of course you can imagine where it goes from here."" ""He fixes the cable?"" ""Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey."")This brings up the final point I want to make about THE BIG LEBOWSKI. There are no straight men. There are no small parts. Every single character is funny and the effect is dazzling. Whereas Groucho has to be the funniest character in every scene, the Dude himself is often allowed to step back and allow the weirdness of others to shine. This is what makes THE BIG LEBOWSKI a unique comedy masterpiece. So what keeps this movie from being a perfect ten? The ending is a little anti-climactic, and the death of a major character dampens the impact. Also the use of the cowboy character in the bowling alley (and as a narrator) struck me as being an annoying distraction.",The Big Lebowski
147,Movie-12,"One of the most original, unique movies of recent years. *** (out of four)",7,25 October 2001,"THE BIG LEBOWSKI / (1998) *** (out of four)By Blake French:The Coen Brothers are an artistic breed of their own. They add a twisted touch of humor to every project. They create imaginative characters, memorable stories, and ingenious dialogue. They have explored the lives of poets, hillbillies, cops, mobsters, adulterers, killers, and now a loser.
That's right, ""The Big Lebowski"" explores the life of a big-time loser. A lazy, uninspiring, unemployed loser. His name is Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who lives in the moment and wears a goatee, a beer belly, a ponytail, and a pair of oversized Bermuda shorts. He lives to bowl, drink White Russians, and to do drugs. (Character: What do you do for recreation? The Dude: Oh, the usual. Bowl, drive around. The occasional acid flashback).
The Dude's best bowling pals, Donny (Steve Buscemi), who is never allowed to finish a sentence, and Walter (John Goodman), who is stuck in the past, diddle with the Dude as he goes with the flow, inhibiting not a care in the world. Until a porn king confuses the Dude for another person with the same name of Lebowski. Thugs invade the Dude's house, plunge his head into the toilet, and pee on his rug. They leave after they realize they have mistaken his identity. However, the Dude wants a new rug. Walter and The Dude take a trip to the rich Lebowski's. They get more than a rug. It appears that someone has kidnapped Lebowski's daughter and the wealthy bigwig wants the Dude to deliver the ransom money. The Dude agrees, and, of course, chaos ensues.
Some of the material falls flat. A subplot about a bowling maniac named Jesus (John Turrturo) goes absolutely nowhere. Fortunately, many scenes work wonderfully, featuring original ideas, thought-provoking metaphors, experimental camera techniques, and eye-popping cinematography. I especially enjoyed how the film explores the Dude's dreams with sequences bursting with color, imagination, and peculiar images. Audiences will remember ""The Big Lebowski"" as one of the most imaginative films of the decade. The Coen brothers create an odd assortment of unique circumstances and characters. The quirky characters have lots of fun with the unbelievably profane, (Screenit.com informs us that the movie uses the ""F"" word 250+ times!), but strangely amusing dialogue.What does it all add up to? Well, there is plenty to think about and plenty to laugh at, but we do not leave with a powerful feeling of satisfaction. ""The Big Lebowski"" may resemble the spirit of ""Raising Arizona,"" another wildly funny comedy by the Coen's, but this movie's does not quite work as well. Both contain the same zany style, but that film felt inspired by plot. ""The Big Lebowski"" lacks plot. A string of amusing predicaments does not necessarily account for the absence of story.  If the film would have followed a clear, comprehensible story, it may have been more involving, but that's clearly not what the Coen brother's wanted. Even before the opening credits begin, the film's narrator (Sam Elliot) explains that this film is about the Dude's adventures. It's not really a narrative of the Dude, but an examination of his reaction to life changing events. By the end of the movie, we sense the Dude has learned from his experiences, and because of them, he is a better personwell, kind of.",The Big Lebowski

My friend was flabbergasted, as she couldn't identify any phrases, humorous scenes, or references that she had ever heard or seen her daughter's group use. She didn't like the movie, either, and was actually checking to make sure that it was the same movie her daughter had recommended.I feel the same way. Frankly, this movie is boring and pretentious.

It's funny, fluffy, and it goes down really well with the mind-altering substance of your choice.Bizarrely, this now-classic film hit the theaters like a beached whale; it barely recouped its costs, and was generally regarded as a lightweight followup to the Coen brothers' acclaimed ""Fargo.""  I can see why people were disappointed, actually.  ""Fargo"" is a tightly plotted thriller, and ""Lebowski"" is shamelessly meandering lunacy.  But both films are masterpieces in their own ways.What's so great about this movie, then?  Without sounding too pretentious, I'd like to submit the theory that it captures the rhythms of modern, everyday life.  Think about it.  We all have stupid hobbies and annoying friends, we'd all rather get trashed than work, and we'd all be pretty hopeless morons if we were suddenly plunked into the middle of a tortuously complex film noir plot.  That's the genius of ""The Big Lebowski""; it puts the average schmuck into a Chandleresque world of intrigue, and the results are hilarious, in a rather strange way.I know lots of people who think this is the best comedy ever made, and I'm almost on board with that - Walter alone propels the film to greatness - but in the end, ""The Big Lebowski"" is just slightly too strange for me to wholly embrace.  Oh, it's great, four stars all the way kind of stuff, but after I watch a ""deeper"" comedy like ""The Odd Couple"" I feel more fulfilled, more enlightened about the human condition.

I haven't seen many of the other Coen brothers movies, but I have seen ""Fargo"" (witch I have to say I wasn't all too fond of, I'll have to see it again) and I just saw ""Barton Fink"" last night.  I also saw ""Raising Arizona"" a while back and loved it.  I'd have to say from what I've seen so far ""The Big Lebowski"" is their best work yet.  I have to see ""Blood Simple"", ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"". And I'm dying to see their upcoming ""O Brother Where Art Thou"".  Anyway, if you are open to interesting comedy, please see ""The Big Lebowski"" and pay attention to every word.  Also, make sure you think about everything they say, some of the things they say are hysterical if you think about it, at first it may not seem so funny.  And one last thing, make sure you pay attention to how the characters interact with each other and put yourself in their shoes.  I love this movie!!!  Thanks for reading. -Cortex",The Big Lebowski
153,OriginalMovieBuff21,"So far, in my opinion, this is the Coen's best film",9,8 February 2006,"The Big Lebowski is about a man named ""The Dude, Jeffrey Lebowski"" who is mistaken for a millionaire with the same exact name and goes through bizarre experiences in an attempt to clear his name. This film is a sure enough promise to make your worries be over after watching the movie. I thought this film was going to be stupid and sure enough it was, but also it was utterly hilarious with smart dialogue and stylish scenes. Jeff Bridges as ""The Dude"" does a terrific job in the film and his bizarre dreams are greatly acted by him. John Turturro, also, had a great role, even though he only starred in about two scenes, the introduction of him was the funniest scene of the entire movie. John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman had good roles too as well. This is a ""stupid"" funny film and that is entirely why I enjoy it, with its slapstick scenes. I liked Fargo and O Brother Where Art Thou, but this in my opinion, is the best Coen film yet. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+",The Big Lebowski
154,Antagonisten,Stylish and exceptionally funny,7,15 January 2005,"The Coen brothers make the kind of movies that i think you either love or hate. Their very special brand of humor and their weird characters make them an experience out of the ordinary.Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is called ""The Dude"" by his friends. He's an aging hippie living the comfortable life mostly just bowling. However one day he is mistaken for the infinitely more ambitious Jeffrey Lebowski, an industrialist of considerable wealth. The mix-up leads to a set of events among including among other things German nihilists and kidnappings.You have never seen Jeff Bridges like this before! I don't know what it is that the Coen brothers have, but they always seem to bring out the strangest things in the actors they use. Just look at John Goodman, as soon as he works with the Coens he shines like never before. Anyway, the very strange comedy that this movie presents is something that defies explanation. But i can say that i found it amazingly funny, well written and well played. And it's also a beautiful movie with high quality photography as well as cinematography.This is probably the funniest movie that the Coen brothers have ever made, in competition with ""Arizona Junior"". A hysterical mix between weird characters, weird comedy and great film-making. A must-see. I rate it 7/10.",The Big Lebowski
155,SquigglyCrunch,"Mostly Funny, but a Little Slow and Weird",7,23 April 2017,"The Big Lebowski follows a man who, after being mistaken for a rich man with the same name, seeks vengeance against the people who mistook him and peed on his rug. It's a weird concept, and that's where a lot of the comedy comes from. Most of the comedy here is pretty good, I found myself laughing a fair bit. A few jokes fall flat, and by the end the movie is just grasping at straws to get both a good ending and some good comedy in there, but as a whole it's a weirdly funny movie. The writing is pretty good too. While it is, again, quite weird and unconventional, it was fun to watch the characters awkwardly live their uninteresting lives, meanwhile balancing the whole rug situation. And the characters were pretty well written too. They were consistent and, there's that word again, weird. The Coen brothers have this way with their movies where they all tend to be quite unconventional and sometimes give off a bad vibe, like it's just too unconventional and thus sometimes hard to fully enjoy. Don't get me wrong I like their movies, they're just really different and not always in a good way, and The Big Lebowski is one of those movies. Moreover, it could be a little slow from time to time. The plot made little progress throughout basically the entire thing, and all the characters really stayed in the same place right up to the end. Overall The Big Lebowski is a good movie, but it's far from the classic people seem to think that it is. Sure, it's funny and mostly well written, but it's a little slow and overly weird, and not everything always works. In the end I'd still recommend it, but it's not as good as people seem to think it is. Not in my book, anyway.",The Big Lebowski
156,auuwws,The Big Lebowski,9,17 December 2020,"A very interesting movie that I really enjoyed watching.

157,saadanathan,One of the greatest ever and the dude abides 9/10,9,16 August 2020,"""The Big Lebowski"" is considered to be among the best movies ever made. The Coen brothers have wrote and directed a wonderful epic movie that has a huge fan base till this day. Centered around a figure called ""the dude"" who finds himself in an unlikely weird adventure consisting of neo nazis, thugs, a big scam, dirty undies and bowling. Jeffrey Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is the dude and the perfect example of an unemployed bachelor middle aged guy who's life style is mostly cannabis and bowling. Jeff Bridges gives what is probably his best performance in a movie ever, and it is known for being his most iconic role ever. John Goodman also gives a wonderful and amazing performance as Walter Sobchak and is mostly hilarious in the film. Gets all the good lines. The film stars other great and well actors: Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, John Turturro, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Sam Elliott. What I love mostly about the film is it's empty plot. Of course there is a lot going on but there are so many bizarre things happening that it doesn't matter anymore what the film's about, nor what are the films motives. In one opening scene you get an introduction to the character and how two thugs ruin his rug. In another scene the dude's car is stolen. Afterwards the characters go investigate a teenager and end up ruining somebody else's car. The point is that the plot is not important, the movie draws most of its magic from the characters and their interactions. Which to me is an important key role in movies to have characters who are fun and have many things happening to them. At the end of the day this is probably one of the best movies ever made and the dude abides on that. Now let's go bowling.",The Big Lebowski
158,departed07,My highest thumbs up for an unothordox film.,10,25 July 2003,"I first saw this film on showtime in 1999 and I got to say that this film was funnier and crazy than hell. The Dude(jeff bridges) is a stoner bum that people confused him for the BIG lebowski(David Huddlestone) because of the last name. So attackers beat the dude up and pee on his carpet. I won't describe the rest of the film, but the wife of the BIG lebowski is kidnapped and it is up to the DUDE to save her. Great cast, funny script, innovated humor. This film is the greatest comedy ever made.",The Big Lebowski

161,SKG-2,"Careful, man, it's a Coen brothers movie!",9,2 February 1999,"Some critics thought this film was for die-hard Coen brothers fans only. Fortunately, I'm one of them, so I found this hysterical.  Sure, it meandered, but that was the point.  When Hollywood comedies are at an all-time nadir, we should be grateful for movies like this, which made me laugh consistently throughout.  Jeff Bridges was perfect, and the rest of the cast was equally wonderful.  One long trip, but highly enjoyable.",The Big Lebowski
162,chaswe-28402,Staggering,10,6 June 2020,"Crisp, elegant, and tightly-plotted, with no loose ends. The titular protagonist of this thriller is a heavyweight business tycoon, a Korean veteran war-hero, disabled but not crippled, with a charming daughter and a devoted second wife, famous for his charitable enterprises. He has an alias, who might be known as the Sherlock Holmes of Los Angeles, an amateur gentleman sleuth with the professional well-honed acumen of someone with a naturally keen intellect. This is no dud, but a man of intrepid action, ably supported by the Alley Irregulars, a couple of great-hearted associates who help him solve the mysteries at the centre of the epic, and who bravely face up to a gang of demented blackmailers and foul extortionists. There are many twists and turns and surprises along the way. What was the significance of the phantom kidnapping? How did the Hollywood big-shot producer get involved? Why did the Police Chief put his hat on before throwing a right hook? Why was the central piece de resistance of the tastefully furnished, state-of-the-art apartment micturated upon?The acting throughout this gripping tale is stellar, the dialogue is courteous and refined, but unfailingly witty. There are a number of Dali-esque dream sequences, possibly owing something to Busby Hitchcock in one of his more surreal moods. Two animals, a marmot and a Pomeranian, play significant roles as the enigma unravels. Several forensic crime investigators are called in. There is also a sagacious Western narrator, acting as a sort of Greek chorus, lucidly explaining the intricacies of the background to the interplay of the characters.Make sure you see this masterpiece before you die.",The Big Lebowski

Being Swedish I of course enjoyed seeing Peter Stormare in a small role as a German nihilist fond of ""lingonberry pancakes"". I also thought Julianne Mores feministic character was very funny. John Goodman, Jeff Bridges and Steve Buscemi were all great in the leading roles. ""The Big Lebowski"" is without a doubt a really, really strange *and* a really, really funny movie. It must be seen to be believed!",The Big Lebowski
165,ethanbresnett,Mix Yourself a White Russian and Bask in Lebowski's Absurdity,8,7 May 2020,"What a ludicrous story. Absolutely bizarre in every way, and all the better for it. It was an absolute farce and there no sense or logic to much of it. All of this makes it very hard not to love The Big Lebowski.The characters were so rich and eccentric that I really didn't know what was going to happen or why it was going to happen. The Coen's are experts in keeping you on your toes during a film. Just when you think things are going to zig the plot goes right ahead and zags. I absolutely love this style of story, and if you are a fan of the Coen's other work, particularly Fargo, this will be right up your street due to the similar levels of farce and buffoonery.Bridges and Goodman were electric, with such good oddball chemistry between them. The sharp script was excellently delivered by both, handling comedy and drama equally well. Buscemi was a fantastic support as expected but the real standout aside from Bridges and Goodman was Julianne Moore. She was an absolute scene stealer whenever she was on screen, adding another great oddball character to the mix. Philip Seymour Hoffman as well! The list goes on, but suffice to say the cast was eclectic and excellent.The Big Lebowski is wildly entertaining, although I must say I never really found it hilarious. Sure it was funny in parts, and there were laughs to be had, but it was never laugh out loud funny for me. Maybe some of the humour didn't age so well I'm not sure, for example the character of Jesus. Still funny but not as hilarious as it perhaps was 20 years ago. The Coen's deal more in black comedy and farce anyway, so I found myself smirking a sufficient amount which is a good sign.As you'd expect from the Coen's the direction was pretty slick. Arty, surreal, and clean in equal measure. To top it all off there was a pretty popping soundtrack.The Big Lebowski is a hoot! Probably one of the greatest collection of odd characters and the most absurd of plots combine to make a triumphant piece of cinema.",The Big Lebowski
166,bsinc,Great funny movie,8,9 September 2004,"I have taken quite a liking towards the Coen brothers. I never really appreciated their work since until recently when I saw both ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" and ""The Big Lebowski"", both very funny and abundantly entertaining movies. The best thing about both these movies was that I watched them each in small bits, every time for about 20-25 minutes. And when I started watching where I left off it was if as I had been watching the movie in one take, there was no ""khmm, I better rewind a couple of minutes back to remember what happened"". They were both highly enjoyable movies to watch because of their simplicity in storytelling. And although simple, the stories are always rich in detail and the two brothers are on hell of a storyteller. I have always loved the movie directors that use the same actors over and over again and then make jokes about this in their movies (the main reason I dig some Kevin Smith movies) and the Coens have a blast out of this as well. It's a homely feeling for the viewer I guess, a sort of subconscious participation and understanding of these jokes, which I find great. The feeling of ""The Big Lebowski"" is very easygoing, just as our protagonist. A great sense of musical accompaniment, great acting by each and every actor and a great sense of directing are all wonderfully presented. Plus there are many laugh out loud scenes that are truly hilarious (the scene where the character of Jesus (a roughly 3 minute Oscar-worthy performance by Turturo) is presented). Oh yeah, and a hell of a script. Simple and loads of fun.7/10",The Big Lebowski
167,DavidSim240183,The Coens strike again!,10,30 August 2007,"The opening scene of The Big Lebowski follows the journey of a tumbleweed blowing in the wind. It makes its way from the desert into the city of Los Angeles. It keeps on going until its final resting place at a beach. All accompanied to the sound of Tumbling Tumbleweeds on the soundtrack. The point the film is trying to make is that in every city in the world, there is one person who is like a tumbleweed. Someone subject to the whims of fate. And in this film, that person is Jeff Lebowski.First off, don't call him Jeff or Lebowski. He's The Dude. A throwback to the stoned 60s that found his way into the stone cold 90s. He doesn't really do anything except for observing the world through a drug addled haze. And on the side he goes bowling with two very odd teammates, Walter and Donny (John Goodman & Steve Buscemi).The Dude's unfulfilled (yet untroubled) life as a slacker takes a detour one night when two heavies break into his house and want money. It turns out these two have mistaken The Dude for the Big Lebowski, a multi-millionaire. They inflict some further harm on The Dude by peeing on his beloved rug (""it really tied the room together"").The Dude goes to see the Big Lebowski to get compensation. To no luck. But on his way out, he helps himself to a rug, and meets Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), the Big Fella's wife. It isn't long before The Dude is up to his goatee in trouble when he gets dragged into a kidnapping plot involving Bunny, that sets off a chain reaction of buggered up drop-offs, Walter's unhelpful help, stolen cars, ransom money, and erotic wet dreams.The Coen Brothers followed up their superb kidnapping caper Fargo with this equally superb slice of Coen kookiness. And again they've crafted a tale around a kidnapping. But that doesn't seem quite as important this time around. Its just a convenient hook to hang a lot of wackiness on.No-one could ever accuse the Coens of being normal. There's always something a little off the beaten track about their films. But that's the reason why I love them so much. At least the Coens are consistent, and they're always trying out new layers of bizarreness that are frequently dazzling.The Big Lebowski has the Coens at their most sadistic. They do seem to enjoy putting the thumbscrews on their characters, and every different plot point is an opportunity to tighten them even further. And Jeff Bridges is the unfortunate soul at the centre of it. He is the man at the mercy of their masterful direction. As he goes through one tough and tortuous situation after another.The Big Lebowski is a wonderful cascade of dire events. Much like Fargo, the scenes interlock with each other, so tiny details can come back and bite you in the arse. The plot is quite sleek and even multi-dimensional. But the Coens are far more interested in dreaming up new and wackier ways to torment the poor Dude. As well as the sublimely inspired gallery of freaks, misfits and wackos they've surrounded him with.Coen regulars John Goodman and Steve Buscemi are back on hand as The Dude's bowling buddies. Goodman's Walter is one of his most eccentric persona's. A shell-shocked Vietnam vet, the man walks a fine line between passive restraint and fiery insanity. Its a role that suits John Goodman down to a tee. And the best part is, its not a caricature he's playing. There is a real man behind the nuttiness. He's a man who's seen more pain in life than anyone should have to. It's that key that makes Walter the most complete of any character Goodman has played in a Coen film.As for Steve Buscemi's Donny, he's a man of few words. But that's because he's never allowed to complete a sentence, since Walter is always telling him to ""shut the f##k up!"". We never learn much about Donny. Just that he always bowls a perfect strike. In Fargo, he died, and does so again here. As much a mystery in death as he was in life. Something morbidly amusing is that lately, whenever Buscemi is cast in a Coen film, he always winds up in little bits by the end.Jeff Bridges is perfectly suited to The Dude. A stoned, strung out loser who glibly coasts by on the chaotic shifts in his life. And his drug induced dream sequences are so far out they're from another galaxy. Wait until you see the one about the Busby Berkeley Viking Bowling dance number, entitled GutterBall. Its a hoot out of hell!When I first saw the Big Lebowski, I was surprised that the ending seems to lose the plot 20 minutes before the credits roll. But then I started thinking about something the narrator of the film (played by Sam Elliott) said at the start. How he lost his train of thought while telling the story. And that's exactly what happens in the film itself. Its a bold move, but its something only the Coen Brothers could get away with. And they do.The Big Lebowski is definitely the Coens in trippy mode. But its a work of inspired genius. And again affirms why the Coen Brothers are so superb at everything they put their minds to.",The Big Lebowski
168,MovieCriticOnline,I was FINALLY able to finish it and....,4,24 March 2020,"I tried for years to watch this, but after I saw Fargo, and this came out afterward, and I always found it to be a weaker copycat of their own work. But they tried harder to be funnier and quirkier so I was never able to watch more than 10-15 before turning it off. I likely tried 3-4 times before to watch, mainly because of all the hype. Today I finally finished it and it was definitely better than I expect I can see the appeal, but I still go with my gut feeling. They tried too hard to top Fargo, which is their masterpiece.With Fargo there was not a dull moment, no meandering and no weird acid trip segments, like with this one. Jerry Lundegaard was a loser, but you still sympathized with him. The dude was a loser, but a real loser, like dumber than dumb and no really redeeming qualities. And John Goodman was just angry for the sake of being angry. Steve Buscemi was totally pointless and underused. And then they had the weird side story with Julianne Moore who wanted to have a baby with the Dude out of nowhere? Just bizarre.Sure there were some funny moments for sure, but over all I found it quite boring and unlike Fargo I don't know if I would watch it again. Also with Fargo they took their time with each character so you got to know them. Here they introduced so many so quickly and left loose ends with some. They could have easily merged some of the bad guys into one or two. So even though I finished it, I had to stop several times to take a break. Not a good sign.",The Big Lebowski

This film is absolutely the best in all ways. John Goodman put on the roll of his life as Walter. This has to be the best thing I have ever seen John Goodman do. As for the rest of the actors, it all seemed to stay on a pretty good track. The Coen Brothers scored again with this movie. It was a great movie and well enjoyed by people all around. This was an absolute treasure to have on the shelf. The Coen Brothers are making gold, but this has to be their best so far.

Aside from the horror comedies I watch, this has to be the strangest movie. However, it is better than most stupid modern comedies. Most modern comedies are the same, all stupid slapstick crap, using the same jokes over and over again in every single movie. The Wedding Crashers, Knocked Up, You, Me, and Dupree, the Breakup, these are all pretty much the same exact movie just with the story altered a bit. But not this movie. This movie relies on acid trip humor, and bad luck (the good kind) and stuff like that. Jeff Bridges is someone I usually see in inspiration movies like ""Tucker"" and ""Seabiscuit"" so this was certainly a change of pace. John Goodman was very funny and random. Steve Buscemi was also very good, along with John Torturro, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, and...well...everyone. Except Tara Reid, could have done without her.

174,EthanBJones_03,The rug that ties the room together!,8,7 June 2017,"'THE BIG LEBOWSKI' was directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, and stars Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Julian Moore. When 'The Dude'(Jeff Bridges) is mistaken for Jeffrey Lebowski(David Huddleston), his life becomes a lot more complicated than before. Word of Advice: watch this movie while intoxicated. I watched it while sober and still enjoyed it immensely but I guarantee that watching this movie while off your head will improve it. That said, this is a very enjoyable comedy. Jeff Bridges shines bright as 'The Dude' with an excellent cast, including John Goodman and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, also providing great performances and being the potatoes to this meat and potato pie. The comedy is pretty good and I'll definitely say that more jokes hit than they do fail. That said, I won't say that many jokes in this movie are hysterically funny; I chuckled a lot but I only full on laughed out loud maybe 2 or 3 times. That isn't a massive gripe but it's something I though I should mention.My main gripe with this movie is that being intoxicated is probably the best way to see it, and that is not a major gripe at all. The story is pretty basic but works well for what it is attempting to do. Despite this, they set up a lot of character and story arcs that go NOWHERE which was really annoying. That is my second major flaw with this movie. It sets up interesting characters like Jesus and even Donnie but then ignores them or even completely forgets them for the majority of the plot. I would rather the characters not be in the movie, than have them in it for only a minuscule amount of time. The ending(which I love by the way) is very open and allows a lot more possibilities for sequels where they could have explored these characters more and gave them more depth instead of cramming them all into this one movie.Even with these flaws, the movie is very damn enjoyable. Its incredible, colourful, imaginative characters really drive the movie and they are what makes this movie shine. That is why I wanted more time going to some of the supporting roles. A lot of effort was clearly put into these characters and I wish they got more screen time to bloom.It's a very technically proficient movie; the cinematography is pretty good. The set and costume design is great. I have no real flaws with this movie as far as sets and camera-work goes. Maybe a few changes to character and set design but I can't say it was anything that really hindered my enjoyment.All in all, this movie is very enjoyable sober(and I imagine even more so while on something) therefor I do recommend this movie to anyone, so long as you're prepared to possibly have a breakdown during a few sequences of this movie.

He goes with the flow of life, even when it turns into white water rapids. His best friend, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) is a Vietnam vet who is an authority on everything, but with little understanding of anything. Donny (Steve Buscemi) is the third member of the bowling team who struggles to keep up with the other two guys in the fast-moving plot, and usually is told to shut the f--- up.Jeff is roughed up at the beginning of the movie as he is mistaken for another Jeff Lebowski (David Huddleston), the real ""Big Lebowski"" who is thought to be rich and has a young trophy wife, Bunny (Tara Reid). Bunny, a former porn star, owes money all over town and the bad guys want to get the money she owes from her husband. Then Bunny gets ""kidnapped,"" and Big Lebowski wants The Dude to deliver the ransom money ($1 million) to the kidnappers. The Dude also encounters Big Lebowski's daughter, Maude (Julianne Moore) who lives in her own ""over-the-top"" artsy world. And Philip Seymour Hoffman has an interesting role as Big Lebowski's assistant. Of course, Walter inserts himself into the ransom money process, and one catastrophe after another ensues. Ultimately we learn there was no kidnapping, that Big Lebowski was trying to steal money from the family trust himself, etc.The film is R-rated, primarily for the unending use of the F-word, though its frequency does match some segments of street talk I've heard over the years. I'm saying ""The Big Lebowski"" was entertaining because it's slick and its off-balanced humor is enough to keep you engaged in the story.

All three where quite enjoyable, but ""Lebowski"" leaves the other two far behind...on the ground...and coughing in its dust.  The dialogue is fast, furious and funny; the performances are grade A and the semi-complex plot is both easy to figure out and great fun to watch.Of course, if there is anything wrong, it is the language.  First it was ""Die Hard"", then ""Reservoir Dogs"", then this.  All great movies, but one wonders if so much language is necessary.  Still, its easy to get over, and it even parodies itself with Sam Elliot's ""Stranger"" character, who questions why all the characters need to use ""so many cuss words"".But, as I said, the good outweighs the bad.

Funny, my critics about this one are exactly the opposite of those I have about O Brother, Where Art Thou?`. There, I felt they neglected the dialogue. Here, the dialogues are Coen-like (Give us ze munny Lebowski or we cut off your Johnson!`) but I missed the visual fascination of earlier movies. And the story is really, really confusing. I'm not sure, if they understood it themselves. But now let me get to the positive aspects: Carter Burwell's music always works; the actors are fabulous, especially John Goodman and  in a completely new kind of role  Steve Buscemi! The Coens can be lucky to have such a well-tempered cast and crew, consisting mainly of their closer friends they have already worked with several times. Jeff Bridges is also great. What else do you need? It's definitely not the right movie to explore the Coen universe  take Barton Fink`, Raising Arizona`, Miller's Crossing` or O Brother` instead.

⚪
All in all, this late nineties Coen brothers flick effortlessly bowls a strike and constantly knocks over all ten pins, as it hilariously combines genuine funniness, crime thriller elements, stoner philosophy, sexual innuendos and even contemporary politics to a bizarre comedy defined by its intelligently composed story, snappy and hysterical dialogues, quirky and comical characters and its indescribably crazy but witty plot, and thus becomes an outstandingly constructed, naturally uproarious and timeless classic that is a fun game from start to finish.
⚪
Almost two years ago, I have already explored the films of the iconic Coen brothers, and since it was during one of the troubled periods of my life, I ended up disliking them for some reason. ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" were the two main casualties of this depressed time where not even my favourite films were able to cheer me up, and I knew that something was wrong. Fortunately, now that a lot of time has passed and I am glad to say that I am doing fine again, I have had the feeling that I needed to rectify this matter, and after having watched (and loved) the Frances McDormand lead snow thriller in February, I decided it was time to give The Dude another chance. As expected, I was able to appreciate it this time around, and honestly, this film is probably one of the best most genuinely hilarious comedies I have ever seen. Seriously, there is literally nothing wrong with it, and the story is masterclass writing as well. The Dude (or El Duderino, if you are not into the whole brevity thing), a layabout and White Russian aficionado, whose real name is Jeff Lebowski, is mistaken for a millionaire who is called the same, and before he could turn round, he is unwittingly entangled in a weird web of kidnapping, rug thievery and bowling tournaments. Even if it sounds like probably the worst things to combine in a film, the Coen brothers know to control the apparent nonsense and turn it into a sophisticated game. It is one of those rare case where the film is defined and made perfect by its screenplay. With meticulous precision, the writer-directors composed a comical crime thriller where not a single line of dialogue, not a single moment and not even a single second of footage feels out of place or unnecessary. The dialogues are pure wit, full of situational and running gags, as well as quotable lines. Seriously, the film makes you laugh for its sheer intelligence and not for infantile actions or lavatorial jokes. Of course, cuss words a crucial factor for why it works out, but they are never used mindlessly and only give the quirky characters a lot of realism. Oh, yes, the characters are another key element of why this film is so iconic. Next to the gown wearing, bowling enthusiastic bum The Dude (one of Jeff Bridges' finest performances), you have his best friend, the choleric Vietnam war veteran and (probably) Jewish hothead Walter (John Goodman is on fire here), a perverse Mexican bowling star called Jesus, a millionaire and his way too young wife, as well as an artistical and sexually open heiress and, hold your hat, a group of German Nazi Nihilist that were formerly porn movie actors and a famous synthpop group (whoa). Savour this slowly! It is downright ludicrous yet brilliant, as the whole story makes it even better. What started out as a pacifistic dude's request to get a replacement for his beloved rug an Asian-American has urinated on, ends up as a twisted and eclectic crime spectacle that is as complicated and confused as its overwhelmed protagonist. First, there was an abduction, than there was not, money was traded and not, The Dude gets punched in the face multiple times for no specific reason, games of bowling are casually played, politics are discussed, dance sequences and dreams are pivotal as well, and in the end, a group of German Nihilists get beaten up in the parking lot. What? Yes, all of this, and even more, but you cannot name it all without giving it all away, because as absurd as it might sound, it is all coherent and intelligently connected. In the end, it is one of those films you need to see to fully comprehend, and there is not a single second when this film isn't pure comedy gold. It now makes me realize how tremendously depressed I must have been back in the day to be unable to love this absolute masterpiece, and I am so glad that I gave it another chance. Most protagonist of comedies you will forget after a time, but man, The Dude abides.",The Big Lebowski
191,jcbutthead86,"A Brilliant,Hilarious Cult Classic Comedy. The Coen Brothers At Their Best.",10,26 June 2013,"The Big Lebowski is an brilliant,hilarious,funny Comedy and a true Cult classic. Filled with great direction,a wonderful cast,fantastic script,memorable characters and a fantastic soundtrack,The Big Lebowski is one of the funniest films of all time and The Coen Brothers at their best.Set in Los Angeles,California in the early 1990s,The Big Lebowski tells the story of Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski(Jeff Bridges),a stoner from the 1960s who loves getting stoned,Bowling,white Russians,his carpet rug and Creedance Clearwater Revival and lives a pretty normal life. Then one night The Dude is attacked by two thugs who mistake The Dude for millionaire Jeff Lebowski(David Huddleson)and urinate on The Dude's rug. This case of mistaken identity puts The Dude in a tale of intrigue and Mystery where he meets various characters and laughs and chaos Ensue.The Big Lebowski is one of the best Comedies of all time and is a hilarious film from beginning to end that didn't get much attention at the time. The Big Lebowski came out two years after The Coen Brothers Masterpiece Fargo which was critically acclaimed and won many movie awards and then after The Coen Brothers did Fargo they released The Big Lebowski,which did modest business at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics,most critics seeing The Big Lebowski as a failure compared to Fargo. But since it's release in 1998,The Big Lebowski has become a one of the all time great Cult Films,one of the funniest movies of all time and is now seen as a classic from critics and audiences and one of The Coen Brothers best films. One of the reasons The Big Lebowski is such great movie is that The Coen Brothers have taken the taken the Film-Noir style and influence of Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep(film and novel)and set in Los Angeles in the early 1990s where instead of long coats and a tough detective it's long hair and a stoner. The Comedy and Humor in this film is hilarious and it mostly based on the situations and dialog and the various characters that The Dude meets or comes in contact with and each character The Dude meets gets weirder and stranger and each character that comes in contact with The Dude is unpredictable and surprising. TBL has a Film-Noir influence because the film has intrigue and Mystery but in TBL the intrigue and Mystery is slightly off kilter and it seems like every character in the film including The Dude is messed up in the head and you never know what's going to happen next. It's Film-Noir told from a Stoner's point of view and it's ingenious and original. TBL also has episodic feel to it where the film and it's characters go from one thing to the next and the plot is complex but not hard to understand and it adds to the great outlandish and hilarious tone of the film. The photography by Roger Deakins is beautiful and Surreal and colorful making the Los Angeles city and landscape look amazing and bright and adds to the film's comic tone and greatness. Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski is one of the most iconic characters in the history of film because as soon as comes on the screen The Dude has this great presence and style and you just never forget him. What's also great about The Dude is that he is a slacker and stoner and doesn't care who knows about it and The Dude has a down to earth style all of his own and he doesn't try to be cool he just is. Although not a Private Detective in the traditional sense like Phillip Marrlow or Sam Spade,The Dude evokes the same style as those two great characters as investigates and tries to solve a mystery and the way The Dude deals with characters whether it's his friends or other characters is funny and classic. The Dude is a character that will be remembered forever. The screenplay Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and well-written with every main character saying hilarious lines and dialog that very quotable and memorable. The ending of the film is funny,tragic and ironic and is a truly classic Coen Brothers ending that adds to the greatness of The Big Lebowski.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Jeff Bridges is excellent and hilarious in his most iconic role as Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski,with Bridges bringing laughs and coolness to the role. John Goodman is brilliant and hilarious as Walter,a Vietnam veteran,who's The Dude's best friend and bowling teammate and Goodman has great scenes and chemistry with Bridges. Julianne Moore is great as Maude Lebowski,a painter and the big Lebowski's daughter. Steve Buscemi is wonderful as Donny,The Dude and Walter's bowling teammate. David Huddleston is fantastic as Jeff Lebowski,The Big Lebowski. John Turturro is excellent and funny in his small role as Jesus Quintana,a sex offender and rival Bowler of The Dude and Walter. Phillip Seymour Hoffman(Brandnt),Sam Elliot(The Stranger,narrator),Ben Gazzara(Jackie Treehorn),Jon Polito(Da Fino),Tara Reid(Bunny Lebowski),Peter Stormare(Nihilist#1 Uli),Flea(Nihilist#2,Kiefer)and Torsten Voges(Nihilist#3,Franz)give good performances as well. The direction by The Coen Brothers is excellent and stylish,with The Coens using slow camera movements,close ups and zooms and beautiful lighting and visual style. Great direction by The Coens.The score by Carter Burwell is great,fun and ominous and it fits the tone of film. A wonderful score from Burwell. The soundtrack also has songs from Bob Dylan(The Man In Me),Kenny Rogers And The First Edition(I Just Dropped In(To What Condition My Conditon Was In),Creedance Clearwater Revival(Looking Out My Back Door,Run Through The Jungle),The Eagles(Peaceful Easy Feeling),Santana(Oyc Como Va),Townes Van Zandt(Dead Flowers),Big Johnson(Viva Las Vegas),Nina Simone(I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good),Sons Of The Pioneers(Tumbling Tumbleweeds)and more. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers,Comedies,Cult Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Big Lebowski,a brilliant and hilarious Comedy and film classic that you can watch again and again.

It has all elements of a ""The Big Sleep"" kind of investigation, but with the most bizarre characters and a grotesque sarcasm typical of late postmodern cinema. The humor comes from the absurd situations and especially the quirky dialogues, but, as with most black comedies, it's more of a chuckling quietly to yourself rather than laughing out loud experience. As a whole, the film felt a bit too episodical if not even pointless at times: the Coen Brother pointed out that the plot is not the focus, but they could have done at least a little better in that sense. Once the case gets abruptly resolved, there is really nothing that ties all the scenes together, however memorable each individual moment might have been.

While Philip Marlow is a suave, yet tough private dick who wears a suit, the Dude is 40+ year old stoner who likes to bowl and wears mostly boxer shorts and a robe (also pays for items costing less than 1 dollar with a check). The story starts out with two henchmen breaking into the Dude's house (mistaking him for a man with a similar name) to collect a debt. Figuring out they had sought the wrong Lebowski, they leave a little reminder of the break in, namely they piss on his carpet (which held the room together). From here the movie takes some unexpectedly wild, yet quite comical turns. The Dude is usually surrounded by his buddies, Walter and Donny. Walter is a slightly unstable, Jewish (converted) ex-Vietnam veteran, while Donny is the proverbial 3rd wheel. This movie is just pure fun. I could not stop laughing the whole movie. The situations are just wild and the Dude's dealing with them is even better. I recommend watching this movie with friends, and with lots of Kahlua, Vodka and milk on hand (AHHHHH.

Truthfully, even when they miss the mark, I am still able to find something worthwhile in the effort. The Big Lebowski is the exception to that rule. I originally saw it in theaters, where it played for an eyeblink and received mixed reviews. It was one of the few films my family has ever walked out on. I caught it later on cable and watched it to the end to see if I missed anything worthwhile, since it had inexplicably developed a cult following. The answer was a resounding no.In what can complimentary be deemed a plot, the action centers on a zoned out bowler nicknamed The Dude, who somehow is mistaken for the title billionaire and gets pulled into what must be the most ill-conceived kidnapping plot in the history of cinema.The ludicrous nature of the action would seem to recommend it to comedy, but the film is devoid of laughs. Unless the idea of a young woman's body parts being sent via mail is especially funny to you. The film introduces one needless and ostentatiously bizarre character after another in order to drum up some semblance of entertainment, but since none of them are important to the ""plot"" and have nothing of comical worth to contribute, it all seems a huge waste.The dialogue is basically thinking up new ways to drop the f-bomb every 10 seconds. What passes for comedy is having the avuncular narrator (Sam Elliott) actually stop the proceedings at the midway point to good-naturedly ask The Dude why he has to to use such chronic foul language, to which The Dude responds with another f-bomb. How meta! How coy! And to rouse viewers lulled into a stupor, there are occasionally pointless unrelated fantasy sequences.Julianne Moore shows up to no avail, speaking in some wacko old-Hollywood actress rhythm (think Jennifer Jason Leigh in The Hudsucker Proxy). But whereas Leigh's impersonation had a legitimate reason to be, Moore's quite simply does not. Jeff Bridges can be an amazing actor and has contributed some wonderful cinematic contributions. This is not one of them. It seems incomprehensible that a following has cropped up around this character, because The Dude is little more than a cipher. The Dude is a completely passive non-entity, who spends the duration in a zoned out state. He seems to have nary an opinion on anything and it is inconceivable that anyone could mistake him for the title character, much less a sentient being at all. The plot careens him from one improbable and unfunny set-up to another eliciting little in the way of energy or emotion from him. He is just not remotely interesting here.The only appealing or likable characters in the film are Elliott's narrator and Steve Buscemi, as a perpetually sunny and helpful fellow bowler. Alas, Buscemi is basically here to be bullied, brutalized, cursed at, and finally die. If most of the cast is awash in unlikable and appalling characters, the worst by far is John Goodman. The normally reliable Goodman is so over-the-top that his every moment on screen is like fingernails down a chalkboard. He plays The Dude's ""best friend"", a completely incompetent bully who inserts himself into everything to the detriment of all involved. He drops the f-bomb as much as The Dude and treats everyone around him with loud-mouthed contempt. He is an illiterate, detestable, brutish bore and the performance desecrates the screen, yet the filmmakers actually seem to think his antics are a riot. The film is pretty awful without Goodman's godawful work, but with his participation it descends even further into cinematic hell.I cannot think of anything to say complimentary about the film and the fact that this abomination was vomited forth by otherwise talented filmmakers seems inexcusable.",The Big Lebowski
198,patches89,THE DUDE ABIDES!!,10,21 January 2021,"One of my all time favourite films. This a black comedy centred around The Dude and his buddies preparing for a bowling tournament until hes caught up in a kidnapping ring. Each character is gloriously written by the Coens from Jeff Bridges The Dude, John Goodman's Walter and Steve Buscemi's Donny to John Turturro's Jesus and Julianne Moore's Maude and others. The comedy is well timed but is nothing without the well written story. This the best Coen Brothers film by far and one id highly recommend to anyone putting on their movie bucket list",The Big Lebowski

2. The ""Big Lewbowski"" is a bumb who inherited his wife's Fortune, and is so materialistic and superficial that his rant on Jeff Bridges and his own hypocrisy are on a lower level as amusing as Walter and his Vietnam PTSD
3. Maude the Bumb with her ""Paintings"" and her video artist buddy also bumbs with money from her late mother, under the pretentiousness of Art like Andy Warhall's toilet bowl.
5. The Nihilist extortionist leader laying drunk in the pool ""Bumb""
6. Jackie Treehorn sleaze bag...he does have to work so one can argue his Bumb status
7. Walter the low income hard earning Security installer and lunatic to run contrast to all characters
This movie was hysterical ! the chase for what obviously was not ""The Money"" and the Underprivileged bum's concern for his Johnson and ""They're going to kill that poor woman""... And Jon Goodman's Judaic /Vietnam rants(Trauma from the War and again from Cynthia dumping him ""From 2000 years of beautiful tradition from Moses to Sandy Koufax your Damn Right I'm Jewish""!

200,ssssgelojun,the big lebowski,9,19 June 2020,"At the core of The Big Lebowski is a convoluted story about mistaken identity and a kidnapping and...a rug that got peed on...and....well, it doesn't really matter what the story's about, that's not important. The Big Lebowski is all about style. The sets, the cinematography, the script are evocative of a very particular vibe...LA in the early 90s. The Dude a character for the ages, an elegy to the American slacker, an aging pothead hippy who just, like, wants to chill out, and smoke a J, man.There is wild surrealism in this movie, too, particularly in the musical scenes, which usually take place while The Dude is under the influence of various drugs (both self-induced and slipped into his drink by Jackie Treehorn, the unscrupulous pornography kingpin of Malibu). Speaking of the music, the soundtrack is stellar, anchored by the phenomenal Spanish language cover of ""Hotel California"" by the Gipsy Kings, set to the sex offender Jesus' bowling moves.",The Big Lebowski

All the thrill from the first hour of the movie did not carry on through the movie and it started to get a bit boring during the middle-part. I was expecting something exciting to happen towards the end of the movie, but it didn't happen; it was such an anti-climax. I also didn't like how the plot twists were presented to easily and how it lacked any sort of drama. For me the movie could have been better if it had a better ending.",The Big Lebowski

204,galileo3,The Big Lebowski is one of the greatest comedies of all time and indeed a modern classic...,10,11 May 2009,"The Big Lebowski (1998)Top 5 - 1998The story goes as follows: Jeff Bridges stars as Jeffrey Lebowski, an unemployed Los Angeles slacker an avid bowler, who refers to himself as ""the Dude"".After being mistaken for a multimillionaire who has the same name, Lebowski is commissioned to deliver a million-dollar ransom in order to secure the release of the millionaire's kidnapped trophy wife. The plan goes awry, and the Dude's friend Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) further complicates the ordeal. The film is narrated by a cowboy known only as ""Stranger"", played by Sam Elliott. Steve Buscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, Julianne Moore, Tara Reid and John Turturro also star in the film. The film's structure has been compared to Raymond Chandler's novel The Big Sleep. The original score was composed by Carter Burwell, a longtime collaborator of the Coen Brothers.The Big Lebowski has the Coens on top creative form, creating a bizarre, visually exciting modern cult classic. Jeff Bridges as ""The Dude"", John Goodman as his slightly psychotic Vietnam war veteran friend provide excellent performances with additional support from Steve Buscemi (an underrated talent) and the fantastic John Turturro in a small role as a crazy bowler named Jesus. The screenplay is fantastic, the photography by Roger Deakins is effective once more and the film itself is one of the most entertaining pictures I have ever seen. The Coens are true masters of modern cinema. Although the film has been criticised by many film critics for its structure, themes and absurd showiness by the Coens, I found the experience to be pure cinematic nirvana! Excellent, surreal comedy 9/10",The Big Lebowski
205,chubarova,Wonderful.,9,13 December 2020,"I knew about this film from another films, because many movies has references to it. Actually, it is brilliant in comedy. Firstly, the plot is great, ir has a lot of funny moments, some twistsand etc. Secondly, the cast is also amazing, Jeff Bridges and his performance is really iconic, John Goodman is very funny and sometimes scary. Actors and actresses in supporting roles are outstanding too. Thirdly, the soundtrack is very suitable to what happens on the screen.

Yet, despite some humourous moments, and quirky characters, I cannot escape the fact that the movie is really not all that great. To be sure the character of The Dude is memorable, and Goodmans Walter is pathetically funny at times. But Buscemi is sadly under valued, while Turturro is too over the top in my opinion. Julianne Moore is quite good though, as are some of the supporting actors like Huddleston. The difficulty I have with it overall, is that its just not consistently entertaining. Though I wish it would have been. In the end this is not the classic screwball comedy many believe it to be.",The Big Lebowski

And, ok, even though I've only seen it once, The Big Lebowski is one of the best movies that I ever saw.So, let's talk, the acting here is fantastic, everyone is great, the characters have this weird charisma, it's hard to explain but you simply care about all of them. The script is super well done, really, for me, the Cohen brothers and Tarantino are the best ""ordinary-dialogues-writers"" out there, is just fantastic how cool every single one of those lines are funny, or meaningful somehow.And I think that my favorite thing about the movie is this, it's super funny, I laugh my ass of through the entire movie, but is also one of those films that you can watch again, and every single time it is going to have a different meaning. It's like a ""thing"" of the Cohen brothers I guess, this is the same with Hail, Caesar! and (of course) No Country for old men. Is just fantastic those types of film, because isn't a movie that you need to see and pay attention to the details, an ordinary guy that just one to see one funny movie can watch this, and just have fun, but some crazy cinema fan (like us) can rewatch, and catch all the hidden things.The soundtrack is terrific too.

208,Mitch-38,Great moments...Eventually loses momentum,6,25 February 2001,"Very offbeat, highly original movie that provides tie ins for mistaken identity, some effective and hilarious characters and off the wall situations. Unpredictable and free spirited, the ""Dude"", our protagonist gets caught in a web of intrigue. This intrigue seemingly and annoyingly takes him away from his happy life of apathy, unemployment and bowling. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is strictly Coen Brothers madness, in the vein of RAISING ARIZONA. The visuals, dream sequences, et al, are very funny and fit well in the movie. Unfortunately, the last half starts to slow down, as the characters start to seem repetitive in their reactions. The humor also waned, due to this, and the plot, not the film's strong suit to begin with, wears down with it. THE BIG LEBOWSKI is still yards ahead of most mainstream releases, yet we've grown rather accustomed (even spoiled) to expect so much more from the Coens. Recommended.",The Big Lebowski

210,PetarNeo,Shut up Donny,10,16 September 2016,"Without doubt one of the most influential movies of 90's. Some of the created scenes are so remarkable and memorable you will remember them for it's profoundness, comedy and repeating dialogue. Coen brothers created one of the most interesting comedy/mystery movie that literally is for anyone who appreciate creation of unpleasant and tense but in the same time funny scenes. It's fantastic how Coen brothers managed to create such a powerful movie from simple fact that somebody peed on Dude's rug and how all development started at getting some compensation for rug. Jeff was a perfect cast for Dude as he show us skills of great acting. Walter Sobchak played by Goodman is one of the funniest characters every created as he brilliantly portraits his and does probably best role of his life in comedy. Intelligently written and created dialogues that radiate with comedy and seriousness. Capability of creating interesting scenes that Coen brothers are able to do is not easy but they are doing it perfectly. 4/4",The Big Lebowski
211,brianberta,Contains a unique plot,9,19 February 2016,"When this film first came out, it didn't do that well at the box office and it received mixed reviews. However, over the years, it has not only acquired a huge cult following, but it has also had many books written about it, analyzing the philosophy in the movie. This seems a bit confusing at first sight because ""The Big Lebowski"" seems like a mediocre comedy film at first sight. However, is it possible that it has a deeper meaning?The movie centers around a man who calls himself The Dude who is an unemployed loser who aims very low in life and doesn't do much. All he wants to do in life is to continue living the way he does and to go bowling. However, one day when he is mistaken for a millionaire by 2 thugs, he gets involved with multiple characters as it becomes possible that the quiet lifestyle he enjoys living may be over.Why does this film work so well in the first place? It has a ton of scenes which could be cut from the movie that wouldn't effect its plot whatsoever. Examples of these scenes include the dream sequences, the talk with the cop, Donny's death, and Maude's attempt to become pregnant with The Dude. Also, half of the conversations seemed to drag on very long and some of the ones which last a few minutes could be summarized in a few lines. Finally, most of its sub-plots have no conclusion to them. Examples include the kid who stole The Dude's car, The Dude's rug being stolen, and the outcome of Maude's attempt to become pregnant. However, the biggest unconcluded sub-plot in the film is the bowling tournament that was hyped up for such a long time throughout the whole movie, only for the film to drop the ball and go nowhere near it. While probably all other films which do this would be dismissed as pure garbage, this one somehow gets away with it. The question remains: why is that so? In ""Burn After Reading"", another Coen's brothers film, its plot was sort of similar as all the buildup in the movie led to nothing. However, what makes this film more unique than that movie is that it didn't even have much of a buildup for its scenes in the first place. Most of the situations and sub-plots in this film stop before they even get going with them or have a chance for the film to explore those sub-plots. Most other films would get despised if they did this. In fact, some people do despise this as it sets them up for disappointment if they became interested in a particular sub-plot.However, what I find so interesting about these sub-plots is how they tie in together with the character of The Dude. The Dude is sort of a loser who doesn't do much with his life. He has no job, he always wears shabby clothing, and it appears that all that matters to him in life is remaining the way he is and going bowling with his 2 bowling buddies. The reason why it doesn't matter to us what happens in these situations is because it doesn't matter that much to him. That's not to say that he doesn't care at all when these situations happen as he does show that he has a moral center. He tries to defend himself so he doesn't get injured or killed by other people, and he also shows concern when Bunny Lebowski gets kidnapped and is in danger of getting killed. However, it also seems that he just wants to live comfortably (even as a lazy, jobless loser) and only worry about himself instead of others or what others want to do to him. The film shows that he only has a moral center when something bad might happen to him or other people around him. Obviously, he doesn't offer the world much, but he also doesn't harm other people. He keeps his goals and standards pretty low and he is a loser, but he doesn't mind being a loser. This is the thing which holds the movie together.Now that I've talked about its plot for a bit, I want to briefly talk about other aspects to the story that I liked. Firstly, the acting is pretty great. Jeff Bridges as The Dude does a great job as the leading role. The dull attitude of The Dude in the film is greatly represented by the dull, but lovable tone of voice that Jeff Bridges shows. Also, John Goodman gives a great performance as Walter. His performance also has some of the charm that Jeff Bridges brought to the screen. Both of them carry the movie excellently as their performances help carry home what the deeper meaning of the movie is. Also, the 2 dream sequences are highly imaginative as much as they are visually intriguing. They're my favorite part of the movie as they are creative, and some of the bizarre imagery in them is actually kind of funny due to the creativity that they have.In conclusion, I'd say that this film is a masterpiece just because it has accomplished something that no other movie I can think of has accomplished in the same way as this one. It tells an original story that has never been done before, and its plot is filled with creativity. Obviously, some people won't like how it doesn't conclude most of its sub-plots so it's not for everyone, but I can appreciate it for its uniqueness and creativity. On top of the unique plot, the acting and dream sequences are also pretty good. I recommend this film to all fans of cinema. If you are able to look over the fact that most of the sub-plots have no conclusion, you are in for a fantastic experience that has never been done before. Also, it will probably remain unique for dozens of years.",The Big Lebowski
212,HelloTexas11,enjoyable stoner comedy,6,15 July 2008,"'The Big Lebowski' was supposedly inspired by the old Humphrey Bogart classic, 'The Big Sleep,' but I don't see it, unless every movie ever made with a convoluted plot is to be considered a descendant of it. What it reminds me of is Martin Scorsese's 'After Hours,' with which it has much more in common. Specifically, the story of an inconsequential character who gets caught up in a byzantine series of situations; the other main feature of such a story is that seemingly anything bad that can happen to the character, does. 'After Hours' though was better, and funnier. I think what 'The Big Lebowski' lacks is the frenetic pace of 'After Hours.' This film just sort of ambles along, amiable and occasionally very funny. Like most Coen Brothers' movies, it is determinedly odd in a lot of ways, but so many films these days are, that quality doesn't come across as terribly unique, or even original. Jeff Bridges is the perfect choice to play Jeff Lebowski, aka 'Dude.' The very definition of the term 'slacker,' Dude doesn't have much of a life beyond bowling, smoking pot, and drinking White Russians. He has two close friends, Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi), and their socializing appears limited to bowling tournaments. But Bridges invests Dude with a sly kind of laidback style; he comes across as a very likable ne'er-do-well, somebody you wouldn't mind spending a few hours with at the corner bar (or bowling alley). Goodman's Walter is a hyper Vietnam Vet who lacks common sense to an astonishing degree and is completely oblivious to that fact; Buscemi's character Donny seems to exist for the sole purpose of being told to shut up, usually by Walter. The film enjoys being weird and bucking convention here and there. A sort of running gag is that whenever Dude is knocked unconscious (and yes, it happens more than once), we enter a dream sequence. The best one is an elaborately staged dance number set to the '60s hit, ""I Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In."" Julianne Moore plays an avant-garde artist with a (surprise) strange outlook on art, sex, and life in general. She's pretty good too. But some of the other oddball supporting characters, like the three Nihilists, are more like something you'd see in a VERY average 'Saturday Night Live' sketch. 'The Big Lebowski' has its own semi-quirky, meandering kind of charm and Coen aficionados will probably enjoy it more than the average moviegoer. Its main appeal, to me anyway, is Bridges' performance. He really inhabits the character of Dude and it's a lot of fun listening to him deliver the droll stoner dialogue throughout. That alone makes the film worth checking out.",The Big Lebowski

Goodman is well known for his comic talents, but everyone in this movie puts forth a full effort in displaying their craft exercised to the fullest. I laughed out loud at more lines and circumstances in ""The Big Lebowski"" than I have in a long time during a movie.There are bizarre circumstances, absurd conversations, acid flashbacks, and entire characters that you may decide aren't really there. I anticipated the ""punch line"" in the strange little funeral that Jeff and John held for their friend, and still had a tummy holding laughing jag when it arrived. I had somehow missed this movie for quite some time, so I am certainly glad I finally watched it. If you are a fan of offbeat, irreverent comedies and haven't caught this yet, this time is nigh!

The story is pretty interesting, it is a nice film, there are Jeff Bridges, John Turturro and John Goodman and even more, John Goodman is very funny as usual, in my opinion, the most funny character in the movie, Jeff Bridges is cool, but no more than that. Moreover, this is not a comedy, this is black comedy, no problem, but I just try to say that ""the hype"" doesn't say that. The hype is problematic also. Some critics write that it is one of the best examples of pure cinema. Sorry, but this is not a Kubrick or Tarantino film. I don't call a movie as pure art so that the camera follows the bowls which roll over! I couldn't see anything great in the movie. As known, the movie has big fans who saw the movie again and again, but never got bored! At the end, there is a speech. It ruins the movie for me a sort of.

Despite his considerable talents and efforts, Bridges never quite succeeds in evoking any interest in this lame character from the viewer. John Goodman is obnoxious playing the John Goodman character, the aggressive supposedly lovable slob. Steve Buscemi is wasted as Donny, an apparent moron with attention span problems. Then we have Hollywood's most overrated actress, Julianne Moore, who assaults our eyes with her grotesque naked form right from the door. David Huddleston, usually a reliable character actor, is here reduced to a whiney old fart.The movie still had a shot.

There's a beverage present here, man.",9,28 July 2006,"The funniest part of this, 'down and outers' comedy is, that I know several guys, that if you took and rolled them into one, they would equal the Dude, Jeffrey LeBowski. that's pretty scary. I don't even think that they have seen the movie, but who cares? Jeff Bridges is so stinking versatile I can't believe it from a reel-live slacker extraordinare to (The Big LeBowski 1998) a reel-President- (The Contender 2000) with out skipping a beat. For all intensive purposes this movie would be a real waste of time, but this was a side splitting whimsical good time!! From Julliane Moore as the egocentric, emotionally-sterile 'Maude' who was a suspicious investigator, to the best friend (Goodman) who's religious nationality 'changes' because of his 'Ex' who dumped him cold. But as long as he can 'bowl' with the Dude, all his other short-comings, just seem to go by the way-side. But through it all, he (Goodman's character) was a loyal buddy to Jeff and a decent friend, even if he could acquire 'fingers' by 3:00...with nail polish. In all fairness though, LeBowski as a 'private' investigator, reminds me of a quote from 'Dirty Harry' where Harry states (after the 'demise' of a man who is a victim of his own stupidity and greed) 'A man should know his own limitations.' and in this case, having Jeffrey investigate is just as swift as letting the 'fox' guard that Ole' hen house. This was a 'slackers delight' and watching someone who is as good a player as 'Bridges' play a tremendously convincing 'Loser' is just a rare treat. In the comedy section, this one is an ever so often player. Just one that you 'havfta see' every now and again. I don't know who he studied, but if I didn't know better I would swear that he got together with my two 'old school' buds. (****)",The Big Lebowski
219,robsta23,The First of Many,9,6 February 2015,"I will start reviewing every movie I see from now on - new to me or ones I choose to re-watch - with careful attention, and this is the first movie I will officially review. I chose this one since I have seen it most recently and it is a pretty simple film with a seemingly complex plot. This is one of the Coen Brothers' best films - not necessarily in the sense of great cinema, but rather in relation to the factor of entertaining the audience. I showed this film to my good friend Spencer just a few months ago and he wanted to watch it again tonight. It is easy to see why since I was quoting/enjoying a lot of the film for its great comedy, such as the many times Walter says ""shut the f--- up, Donnie,"" how the Dude repeats things he hears from other people in order to get his point across, or how ridiculous the narrator's moustache is. I remember that on first viewing I did not appreciate this film since it is revealed by the Dude towards the conclusion that the MacGuffin of the film - the briefcase filled with a million dollars - was never really filled in the first place. Like Fargo, The Big Lebowski deals with the idea that most will go out of their habits or comfort zone in order to obtain an amount of money - however, it does so in a more ridiculous manner than Fargo. After a few re-watches I have found it important to appreciate this film's comedy rather than make sense of the almost non-existent plot in order to enjoy it. Does it matter that The Dude's journey turns into a dead end? No; his journey is still progressive as he goes from not giving a damn about anything to confronting people of the seemingly upper class about using him, and the journey has a great deal of laughs making this a great cinematic experience to enjoy and reflect on the importance of taking things easy in everyday life. 3.5/4.0",The Big Lebowski

But he keeps is cool, no matter how ridiculous the world surrounding him is, including his friends. This film is really funny, really far out, I definitely recommend it. Check out Torturro with his ""Yes I am ze Jesus"". Steve Bushemi is really sweet in this. and there is the cowboy and a bunch of really really crazy people that sum up America as we know it. All the dude really wants to do is bowl.",The Big Lebowski
222,JaydoDre,Has character,7,21 December 2014,"Ehm...they did not finish the story.Were we not supposed to notice or were we not supposed to care? Towards the end Big Lebowski had about 5 or 6 story threads going, but left 2 of them untied at the end, one of which was a relatively major one. There is unexplained plot point or two. All in all, the story ends up being kind of disappointing.Then again, the story is not very important because this movie is all about the characters. The Dude and Walter Sobchak, the main characters played by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman respectively are awesome and memorable creations. Yes, Steve Buscemi is there too, but he doesn't do a lot. All of the characters in this film are eccentric. On the one hand, that is what gives this movie its colour, but on the other hand, this approach to character creation feels a step below simply having good believable people who are different from one another in a subtle but perceivable way. You and I, we too could come up with some crazy personalities that would as a result be memorable: we can create a guy who makes racist jokes every time he appears on screen and smokes a whole lot so we will make him have two or three cigarettes in his moth at all times. Making ridiculous characters is easy and lazy. And while the Dude and Walter ultimately do work as characters, some of the others in this movie do not.There are a few funny moments in this film, but there are equally few jokes that fail. The dialogue can be pretty good, pretty stupid and sometimes both at the same time.The film has a number of interesting looking scenes, mostly when the main character is knocked out or drugged. The music covers the visuals with a layer of rock, complementary to the Dude's and Walter's 60s persona. It is safe to say that the film goes for a specific style and nails it. It is only unfortunate that it is a bit more style than substance.Big Lebowski is like the weird friend in your party who is awkward and sometimes ruins things, but he has in time grown on you and you know that the party just wouldn't be the same without him. In that aspect he is very much like the main characters of this film.",The Big Lebowski

224,ThomasColquith,Memorable unique comedy,7,5 June 2021,"""The Big Lebowski"" has many scenes and lines that will stay with you. It has good cinematography and interesting characters, so it is fresh. I especially like the characters portrayed by Goodman and Bridges and their friendship. This movie is a reminder to me that for the many people out there without close family, your friends become your family. And these sorts of people, who you'll meet at the bar or bowling alley may have their own issues, such as Walter, but they are friends nonetheless, and even if you don't have a lot of assets, you can still have friends.So, for me, this film in a way celebrates the poor, the humble, those who are overlooked or called losers. Even though things don't exactly work out for the Dude and Walter, and I hated to see Donnie die, but life goes on for them just as it had before the story. They keep muddling thru no matter what.The negatives for me which hold this film back from a higher rating are the excessive cursing, vulgarity, and extended dream sequences. For these reasons, I give it a 7.0/10.0.",The Big Lebowski
225,datorsiers2,Didn't do the trick for me .,6,25 August 2015,"I must say, that i didn't get what i expected to get out of this film. It has a high rating, but i don't think this movie deserves it. It isn't as funny as people claim it is.First of all, the problem for me was the main character itself, ''The Dude'' just wasn't funny, he didn't react to anything and was just chill all the time, on the other hand Walter was an awesome character, quite enjoyed watching him. The movie doesn't really show what happens to any of the characters, the most irrelevant character dies, nobody really cares about that, they got this bowling rivalry going on, but the movie didn't even show a second of the big match. The last half of the film was just plain. Having many unlikable and irrelevant characters just threw me off, if it was not for Walter i would consider this movie thrash.In my opinion, a little over hyped, there wasn't anything that great or unseen in the movie at all.",The Big Lebowski
226,MF210,Its funny but also a mess,8,7 September 2003,"My Rating: ***1/4 out of ****. I consider myself a fan of the Coen Brothers, I loved both Fargo and Raising Arizona. I found The Big Lebowski to be entertaining but it had a convoluted storyline. Does This make it a bad movie? Absolutely not, and this is because of the wonderful dialogue the Coen Brothers have provided for us.
The acting is one of the strengths. Jeff Bridges is absolutely perfect as The Dude. John Goodman is hilarious as Walter. Steve Buscemi really doesnt do much except get insulted by John Goodman. Julianne Moore takes a different kind of role and does well. To enjoy The Big Lebowski, you must do one thing: Forget the plot. You will hate the movie if you try to figure out the plot. It is a mess of a plot. At one point it gets incoherent, but that scene is one of the best in the film.
The Big Lebowski is not a masterpiece, in fact its even really far from a near-masterpiece stature. But it is highly entertraining and it will calm your nerves after seeing a movie called Requiem For A Dream.",The Big Lebowski
227,stimpy_tr,Rambling again,6,19 June 2021,"This is another classic(!) from Coen brothers. The storytelling is the same as in Fargo (1996). It is done through a collection of skits. If you look closely, you will realize that the plot is so weak and I find the main characters overacting. There are interesting ones like Jesus though. However, they are wasted by the skit-style narrative with loads of meaningless dialogues. Just like the cowboy admits in the end, Coen brothers are rambling again.",The Big Lebowski
228,michael_the_nermal,What's the Point? It isn't funny,1,10 March 2008,"Spoilers ahead.I frankly do not understand why ""The Big Lebowski"" has been elevated to the point of being considered one of the best cult classics of all-time. Why this cult around the character of ""The Dude"", one of the blandest, flavorless, most uninteresting comedy protagonists ever to be put on celluloid? He's simply some dopey hippie who loves to hang around a John Goodman cardboard-cutout Vietnam vet gone loco (real Vets should raise their fists in anger over such an overdone, unfunny, disrespectful and insulting characterization) and a seldomly-seen Steve Buscemi, who doesn't really do much. The plot winds into so many different twists and turns and includes so many supporting characters, all of whom seek The Dude's bag of money, that trying to understand this movie is like trying to untangle the Gordian Knot by hand. What's the point of placing layer upon layer upon layer of weird, uninteresting characters to the point that you forget what the hell this movie is about? Nihilist German rockers? Some sicko Hugh Hefner clone? A gorgeous yet incomprehensible avant-garde artist who wants to have ""The Dude's"" baby? A strange drugstore cowboy who serves as some sort of Greek chorus? Stop it! ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" had an array of weird characters, but it succeeded because it had a straightforward plot and brilliant acting and writing. The Coen's monstrosity has little wit or signs of superb comic writing, and all of their characters, though weird, are totally boring and flavorless. For weird characters to work, they must act totally off-the-wall and twisted beyond realism. The weirdos in ""Lebowski"" are actually regular, and seem like a mish-mash of all-too-real rejects from a yuppie coffee bar.Who likes this stuff? I have just seen ""No Country for Old Men"", and, like ""Lebowski"", that was poorly written in terms of a smooth plot; and, like ""Lebowski"", lacked any interesting characters. I'll give ""Fargo"" a chance; otherwise, the Coen Brothers ain't reeling me in with their weird, clunky movies.",The Big Lebowski
229,CrassActionHero,Awesome Comedy,10,29 December 2006,"The Big Lebowski(1998) Review: The Coen brothers are back. Say hello to The Big Lebowski.This movie has one trend, the characters. If you think about the plot, you really do not have to understand the plot at all. The focus is on the characters. Jeff Bridges is Lebowski, or ""The Dude"". After two jerks take a leak on his rug, our story begins.Be on the lookout for many other characters such as Walter Sobchak(John Goodman)is possibly the funniest and most realistic character here who is still living in the past Vietnam buff. Goodman is at his best here as Walter. He delivers the best. You are guaranteed to laugh.The story does take many viewings to truly understand, but this is a very addictive movie. After one viewing, you can't stop after one. There is also plenty of curse words here. The f-bomb is quite the norm. So this is not for the kids folks. But for the adults, this is a hoot.You can't go wrong with a fantastic cast either. From Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, John Turturro, Julianne Moore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Steve Buscemi, you can't go wrong. There is also bowling here too.The Last Word: Damn funny. This is all about the characters, not the plot.(even though it's not bad)The Big Lebowski is just plain funny. Just remember, the F-bomb is heard almost every minute here. So, this isn't for the kids.",The Big Lebowski
230,rob-236,A Film of 2 halves,5,17 May 1999,"This film starts off a treat and for the first hour its lightning pace doesn't let up.  We are introduced to a likable rogue in Jeff Bridges' character, Jeff Lebowski and his friends who spend all their time bowling, drinking and smoking and its fun, Bridges gets mistaken for another (rich) Jeff Lebowski, whose wife has been kidnapped for ransom. John Goodman is great as his psycho Vietnam freak pal although Coen favourites Steve Buscemi and John Turturro seem wasted in do-little supporting roles. Anyway the story unravels well until all of a sudden the razor sharp humour is replaced by the constant blurting out of four letter words, while the storyline just seems to shoot itself in the foot and the whole film becomes one big muddle, and at nearly 2 hours it seems to go on for far too long. A shame, although the film does try desperately to wrap up a mountain of loose ends at the end but by that time you will have probably lost interest in it altogether. Despite all of this, worth a look as you will laugh at most of the jokes.",The Big Lebowski
231,Benjamin_Cox,A darkly humorous noir with two of cinema's biggest losers - 91%,9,28 October 2008,"Films by the Coen brothers I often find a little intimidating. Everyone agrees that they're not for a mainstream audience but you certainly need your wits about you - basically they are films for connoisseurs and as much as I enjoy my movies, I've always considered myself to be a casual movie-goer. It has taken me a long time to get around to watch this movie - as it did with ""Fargo"" - but as with their other movies, I enjoyed this immensely. It is genuinely as interesting as it is amusing, littered with faultless performances and a classic film-noir style plot that twists and turns around the quote-happy dialogue.Jeff Bridges plays Jeff Lebowski, a pot-smoking slacker living in LA and preferring to go by the name of The Dude. Spending his time bowling with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donnie (Steve Buscemi), The Dude is the victim of a vicious beating by two clueless goons who mistake him for Jeffrey Lebowski, the millionaire. Seeking compensation for his ruined rug, The Dude quickly finds himself drawn into a complex kidnapping case and begins to find himself out of his depth. With an ever-growing list of people seemingly intent of manipulating him to their will, The Dude finds his laid-back attitude sorely tested as well as his friendship with the quick-to-anger Walter.While my suspicions that this film's plot would be complicated were right, at no point did I find my attention wandering or my understanding of the story diminished. This is story-telling on an epic scale, reminiscent of classic noir movies like ""The Big Sleep"" and ""Double Indemnity"". But there is a black-as-night streak of humour running throughout the film, mainly from Goodman as the borderline psychotic Vietnam veteran, that's brilliantly pitched. With dynamite performances throughout the cast, it's difficult to pick out any one actor but Bridges rightly deserves the plaudits as he is utterly convincing and oddly lovable as the bearded waster bumbling his way through the film with a child-like naivety. The only possible downside that I can think of is that it does need multiple viewings to get the most out of it and as I've already said, you definitely need to give the plot your full attention.""The Big Lebowski"" could arguably by described as the ultimate ""stoner"" movie but seeing as that brings to mind stuff like ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" and ""Harold & Kumar Get The Munchies"", that is doing this movie a grave injustice. This is a movie with real depth and charm - a classic detective story with the most unlikely sleuth imaginable. It may be complex and ""high-brow"" but don't let that put you off as this is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen for a long time - it's much lighter than their other efforts I've seen like ""Fargo"" which was quite dark. It actually reminded me of ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" but this is much funnier and more entertaining than that - Bridges and Goodman are a much better pairing than Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer. Forget any trepidation you may have - this is the Coen's at their absolute best and even if you're a casual movie goer, you owe it to yourself to watch ""The Big Lebowski"". Man...",The Big Lebowski

The Dude, Walter, Donny, Brandt, Maude, Bunny, Jesus, and even The Stranger & The Nihilists are all very memorable characters, and you'll laugh pretty much all the way through.

How entertaining and unwind movie of the '90s makes me always smile ...",The Big Lebowski
234,scottsetchell,This is Just Like My Opinion Man,10,17 April 2019,"The Big Lebowski is the 7th film written, produced and directed by the Coen Brothers. The script was written in the early '90s around the time they released Barton Fink. In the meantime, they wrote, produced and directed the box office bomb, The Hudsucker Proxy, as well as the critically acclaimed and Oscar award-winning, Fargo. They waited as long as they needed to get Jeff Bridges and John Goodman in the cast and it paid off big time.Similar to The Big Sleep, The Big Lebowski takes a convoluted plot to extreme measures. Both films include a wealthy, handicapped millionaire, promiscuous young women, blackmailers and pornographers. Both films make us connect characters to one another and piece together a scattered plot.Taking a large step back from everything that happens in The Big Lebowski, the story is essentially about nothing. There is no money in the briefcase. There is no hostage. The nihilists believe in nothing except money. The Dude is not seen bowling. The Dude has no job and we don't know how he makes an income. Walter uses Shomer Shabbos as an excuse to do nothing on Saturday even though he's no longer Jewish. The only reason The Dude gets involved with Lebowski is due to his rug and agrees to work with him for just a small portion of the ransom. From the beginning, The Dude, Walter and Maude assume that Bunny kidnapped herself to extort money from Lebowski.The bowling alley is the safe haven for The Dude and his team. Walter takes the bowling league very seriously. He threatens a bowler with a gun for stepping over the line and gets him to mark zero on his scorecard. When bowling rival Jesus Quintana (John Turturro) confronts the team, Walter reminds them he's a sex offender that exposed himself to an eight-year-old. Throughout the story, The Dude shares his news to Walter and Donny at the bowling alley. The mysterious man most likely overhears their conversations which is why he can narrate The Dude's story. He's seen talking to The Dude at the bowling alley's bar and appears again at the end. He never introduces himself, but Sam Elliot's resonant accent and thick mustache make his character memorable.The script is very funny and explicit. The Dude and Walter's dialogue often clash but it doesn't get in the way of their friendship. The script was written specifically for Jeff Bridges and John Goodman's characters. Jeff Bridges is perfectly cast as The Dude, he's often misunderstood and spacing out in his own world. Unlike previous Coen Brothers films with Steve Buscemi, Donny can barely get a word out before Walter tells him to shut up. Julianne Moore puts on an interesting accent as Maude, that isn't distinct to any one place. Maude's giggly assistant, abstract artwork and sexual nature make her one of the funniest characters in the film. She's the centerpiece of the Gutterballs dream sequence as a sexy Viking surrounded by bowling pin dancers.The soundtrack is great and it's referenced throughout the film. The Dude and Walter are listening to Creedence Clearwater Revival's ""Run Through the Jungle"" when delivering the briefcase. The cops who look for the car are worried the tape deck with Creedence would be stolen and are relieved when they find it still there. The song used in the opening credits, ""The Man in Me"" by Bob Dylan is used again when Maude knocks out The Dude and takes back the rug. They play the Rolling Stones song ""Dead Flowers"" by Townes Van Zandt after Donny's death.The directing by Coen Brothers is very well done. Many of the cast members are reoccurring from previous films they've directed. The film's structure was influenced by detective fiction writer Raymond Chandler. The cinematography by Roger Deakins made the scenes look contemporary with the time period and the dream sequences to look bizarre. Deakins worked on previous Coen Brothers films such as Barton Fink and Fargo, as well as The Shawshank Redemption. The editing is impressive, especially during the dream sequences. The first-person camera shot inside the bowling ball as it rolls down the lane for a strike looks very sharp. They use pan and zoom shots frequently to go from a wide view of the setting to the subjects. They use long takes, the most impressive coming in the final scene, that finishes with a strike.At the time, The Big Lebowski was one of the Coen Brothers highest budgeted films at $15 million. It grossed just over $46 million worldwide. The Big Lebowski can be enjoyed on many viewings and it succeeds as both a comedy and a crime film. I highly recommend this film to adults.4/4",The Big Lebowski
235,jake-law123,Classic Coen Brothers.,7,20 January 2016,"After being beaten by thugs who mistake him with somebody of the same name, Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) confronts millionaire Jeff Lebowski on the mistaken identity, a confrontation that will lead to several bizarre and unforeseeable twists for him and his two bowling buddies, (John Goodman, Steve Buschemi).I'll be the first to say I do not see what all the buzz is about with this film. For some reason hipsters like to blow this up to be an absolute masterpiece, which is endlessly praised, quoted, and cos played. I like it a lot, but to me it doesn't stand out nearly as well as some of Coen's others, even though I still enjoy it. To me, it's a clever, fun, stoner comedy with a great cast and characters, but that's where it stops for me honestly.The characters are very colorful, Jeff Bridges is perfectly cast as the Dude, an icon that is mercilessly cos played, and he is funny in the movie. John Goodman as former Vietnam lieutenant Walter Sobchak is a great backup for The Dude as he mostly plays the muscle for all the predicaments they get involved in. Steve Buschemi's character was good overall, even though he doesn't get much screen time. What's great is that even the small roles in the film who get one or two scenes, still make an big impact on the film in the few scenes they're in. I can't very well make a Big Lebowski review without mentioning Jesus, the bowler for an enemy team of the Dude's bowler team, excellently cast by John Turturro, one of my favorite Coen alumni. Others like Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore are also quite entertaining for the few scenes they are in.When I first watched it, I thought the plot was very bloated, lots of scenes and subplots that really go nowhere. Even though it adds to some funny scenes, overall it doesn't amount to much, but oh well. Regardless of my small complaints with this movie, it's a very fun, well made film with some entertaining characters, with some slight editing issues. Solid nonetheless",The Big Lebowski

I can't believe that more movies aren't this funny or original. Hollywood needs to take a lesson from the Coens and start making quality films instead of churning out crap like Gigli and Legally Blonde. The Big Lebowski is perfectly cast. Jeff Bridges IS the Dude and I've never seen him more comfortable and at home in a role. John Goodman's Walter is one of the funniest and most conflicted characters he has ever played. Everyone in the movie does well, Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves praise for his proper, endlessly smiling assistant Brant. The soundtrack enhances the feel of the film and fits it perfectly. The humor and innate weirdness of the movie only furthers the genius of the Coen brothers.

237,caseynicholson,A Humorous Dark Coen Brothers Film,7,23 August 2015,"Today I saw ""The Big Lebowski"" for the first time. Somehow I missed this movie in 1998 and never saw it on DVD in the years after its release. About the only thing that I knew about the film was that Jeff Bridges was ""The Dude"". Now I know the rest of the story.Before moving on, I'll offer up this quick disclaimer: This is in no way a family friendly film. That should be expected from the Coen Brothers, but since I went into it not knowing what to expect at all, and my only perception of the film being that it was mostly a comedy, I thought that it might be somewhat lighter than most of the Coens' stable of films. And it was. But there's still language throughout the movie, along with some fairly adult themes at points. Several times along the way I found myself feeling that this was the Coens' answer to ""Pulp Fiction"" (the chasing of the brief case, the remark about the quality of the In-n-Out Burger, the fact that Bridges dresses like Travolta and Jackson at the end of PF, etc.).The film is quite funny, in that dark style of humor that the Coens are known for. Sometimes the humor is so prevalent that it becomes banal. Nevertheless the film does feature quite a few good laughs. But then mixed in with those laughs are the odd Coen Brothers moments, such as what I'll call ""the ear scene"", in which the mixture of humor and horror blends in a way that challenges the viewer's comfort.My main beef with this film is that it doesn't end with a resolution. Yes, all ends well (Spoiler alert, but ""The Dude Abides""). Still, you never find out what happens to the briefcase or whether it had money in it (another similarity to Pulp Fiction). The situation with Bunny sort of gets forgotten, too. All in all the ending of the film just felt anticlimactic to me. I nevertheless did enjoy the movie, though. It is what it is, a Coen Brothers film that makes you laugh all while pushing boundaries. Still just as there are Elvis people and Beatles people, I think that there are Coen Bros. people and Tarrantino people, and I'm a Tarrantino person. So I think I'm going to go with 7/10 stars.

243,JPfanatic93,A true nonsensicomedy,8,22 September 2013,"Outrageously zany, off-beat comedy the likes only the Coen Brothers can provide. Life is tough for the pot smoking all-round slacker Jeffrey Lebowski, more commonly referred to as ""The Dude"" (Jeff Bridges in one of the most defining roles of his career). Sharing his last name with a millionaire, he's victimized by thugs who mistake him for that rich man (who owes them a debt), a situation which finds his beloved rug in ruin after having been urinated upon by the perpetrators. When he visits his namesake to try and get him to pay for its cleaning, he soon gets more than he bargained for as he finds himself caught up in what appears to be a kidnap of the wealthy man's trophy wife, but swiftly explodes into a bizarre, inexplicable potpourri of events beyond anybody's control or understanding, thanks to the involvement of a host of wacky, maniacal and thoroughly enjoyable characters, ranging from feminist/nihilist artists and pornographers to White Russians and generally random folk annex narrators. Yet all The Dude asked for was a clean rug and an opportunity to win the local bowling alley's competition he trained so hard for with his two best buddies (John Goodman with severe anger management problems and Steve Buscemi who can't take a hint when he's asked to shut up). The Coens don't ask you to make sense of it all, they just want you to roll with it (pun intended), as The Dude does himself. Nevertheless, despite this absence of a clearly defined plot, or more likely because of it, The Big Lebowski proves all kinds of fun. The pair of directors used the same tactic a decade later with Burn After Reading to similar results, proving them the masters of this subgenre of 'nonsensicomedy' (for the record, I just made that term up and I hope it catches on). In both cases they were aided by an impressive cast of character actors and/or movie stars who felt like doing something different for a change, in The Big Lebowski's case including Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro, Julianne Moore and Sam Elliott. Though the film was met with moderately tempered critical reviews and disappointing box office results back in 1998, time has proved the Coens right, as it has since become a widely accepted cult classic with serious tendencies towards an eventual, seemingly unavoidable shedding of the moniker 'cult'. When Burn After Reading came along in 2008, the majority of both audience and critics finally understood this type of film, and that movie did much, much better business accordingly.",The Big Lebowski

Soon the dude finds himself entangled in a web of lies, as he attempts to find out who the money came from, and why they owe it. There are many plot twists along the way, which I won't ruin, although it's futile to think this film is about plot.This is perhaps the Coen Brothers' most creative work to date. Even their wildly abnormal works like Raising Arizona have been matched for delightful weirdness, in the form of The Dude's various trip-out dream sequences. This being a Coen's film there is no such thing as a small part. Check out John Turturro's wild cameo as malodorous Paedophile-cum bowling deity Jesus Quintana. Or Sam Elliot as the film's bookending cowboy narrator. He sums the film up brilliantly two minutes in when, as our narrator, he says ""Maybe I just lost my trail of thought. Maybe...After viewing ""The Big Lebowski"" I was convinced that Jeff Bridges' sole existence on earth was to play The Dude. He is just perfect as the man who seems to get through all the destruction in his life with an apathetic retort of dowdy-hippydom. In a demented way it's what makes him so tranquilly admirable. John Goodman matches The Dude's bathos with psychotic blunder, and Steve Buscemi's Donnie is a rare Buscemi treat of cluelessness.Despite it's convolutions The Big Lebowski never feels unrewarding in its Rubik's-cube plotting. Whereas earlier works like the ambitious Miller's Crossing (1992) were flawed on basic storytelling levels, here we are treated to the demented worlds first, and story second. The denouement is somewhat of an anti-climax but by that point you are so far into the world of deadbeat optimism that you won't be disappointed. In fact, the indifference to it's own crescendo makes for a very fitting finale. In the end, it's not the destination the counts, it's the ride. And what a ride. I don't think Joel and Ethan have written a script with better lines, nor do I think they've ever had a better cast. This is a film without meaning, but loads of heart. And white Russians too.",The Big Lebowski
246,Svenstadt,"A little far out of left field but nonetheless solid, gripping tale.",9,10 April 2018,"This movie has a big personality, and I could have given it a 10, but I felt that a 9 was more appropriate. This is basically a post-modern tale that anyone growing up in the 90's will understand. Everyone should find this entertaining, especially on re-runs on all the networks. 
It requires attention span as the story is rather complicated. It also has a great number of characters to introduce. But the filmmakers do it so well that it doesn't lose any points. 
I didn't give it a 10 because it is so outlandish and over-the-top that even the most gullible will want to walk away from it at times. There is a character, played by John Turturro, who is a registered sex offender, who plays bowling alongside the three main characters in league bowling, and they felt the need to do a cut-scene to tell his story, even though he is only in one scene. Also, there is the guy who is a stage actor, who wants the Dude to go to his performance, and the dude nearly forgets - this character has nothing at all to do with this movie, so the scenes changed about every 2 minutes!!! Also, John Goodman's character getting away with threatening to shoot someone in public, and the cops show up and somehow miss him!! Way too over-the-top. It felt at times like a pornographic display of garishness.",The Big Lebowski
247,Mike Sh.,The Funniest Movie Ever,10,3 May 1999,"The debate continues among the Coen Brothers' fans as to whether this movie measures up to its predecessor, ""Fargo"".  As good as ""Fargo"" is, this movie is much more fun to watch.  I saw this movie in Harvard Square in the spring of '98, and I can't recall ever laughing so hard in a movie theater.It's a great film in so many ways, but the writing is what really makes it shine.  The interplay between the Dude, Walter and Donny is perfectly timed, as is their run-ins with Jesus the Bowler.  All of the actors' performances are excellent, and the special effects in the dream sequences are first-rate.  This movie hit me just right, and has held up well in repeated viewings.  Very highly recommended!",The Big Lebowski

But at other times it is simply, flawed, annoying, silly & stupid. The main character is an interesting character, I liked ""the Dude"". His friend Walter must be the most annoying film character I've ever seen. But he serves his purpose. But then again, you got Buchemis role, he just pops up now and then, never really contributes. The story was good, ""the dudes"" struggle was funny. But it just kinda ends up with nothing. I don't know. Some call it the 2001 of bowling and weed smokers, fair enough, it has a few clever trippy moments. But I don't know, it lacks structure. I give it a 7/10.",The Big Lebowski
249,sakram,"Below-Average movie, very far from perfection, and sure as hell is it not a 8-star movie.",1,10 December 2020,"Let's keep the exaggeration out of the window. I am not even that much of a hard-to-convince woman. The Big Lebowski seems to be loved by many. It starts out promising, and at some point throughout the film, ""The Dude's"" gimmick didn't really tick me off. But what went so wrong with this movie is the plot that went downhill around half-way through the movie.
You get to realize, it's a wasted opportunity, and nothing really is going to happen. The end if very anti-climatic, and there are a lot of scenes that contribute nothing, absolutely nothing, to the plot, nor the humour.Don't get me wrong, the humour is somewhat fine and at times it's digestable, but towards the end, the movie gets absolutely disgusting and meaningless, shoving braindead scenes and pointless gore, helpless attempts at teen humor and tying loose ends into different loose ends. Nothing really made sense and I felt like this movie shouldn't have been as long. I wasted my time and should've dropped it half-way where it stopped being good.I am rating it a 1/10. It started out as a 7, and ended up horrendously disappointing.",The Big Lebowski
250,thehumanduvet,"Awesome, 100% perfect movie - a definite 10/10.",10,20 February 2001,"This film shines like a great big ball of burning gas in the sky, providing all who live beneath its great shining beauty with warmth and light and happiness. It truly is one of the most amazingly brilliant masterpieces ever made, packed with visual and verbal invention, skill and class. Every second, every frame is simply magical, from the grimy milky toilet of the opening scene through all those wonderfully colourful, crazy dream sequences to the final pan of the camera away from our heroes, a riot of colour, imagery and beauty. The story is a wonderfully rambling, sprawling tale based loosely on Raymond Chandler and old Bogey movies, packed with Chandler staples and nods to great classic film noir, the characters are all brilliantly conceived, written and played. Bridges and Goodman make a truly classic odd-buddy combination, Buscemi and Turturro play wonderful minor comic figures wonderfully, Julianna Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Thewlis, the list of great actors playing out of their skins goes on and on. The music is perfect, Sam Eliot's narration is awe-inspiring (who else could possibly have played that part?), but above all it is the visual splendour of every scene which makes this film really stand out. What the Coens have created here will last forever as one of the very last great cinematic achievements of the Twentieth century, and sets a standard towards which all future filmmakers will have to stretch themselves to the utmost to reach. A truly flawless film which leaves the viewer with a lasting sense of pleasure and satisfaction and even manages to improve with each successive viewing, The Big Lebowski deserves every possible award and recognition available, and should be seen by every sensible person on the planet as often as possible. Only through this can true world peace and prosperity be achieved.",The Big Lebowski
251,davek28,Keep these people away from me.,5,5 August 2001,"Fortunately, I recorded this film off Channel 4 (UK), so I could fast forward through all the dialogue.  Don't get me wrong - I like films with lots of dialogue.  But in this case, they were just shouting at each other, ranting on about nothing much at all.  Lots of angst wasted over trivialities.I was willing to be won over by a Coen brothers movie - I really enjoyed Fargo - but this just seems such a waste of celluloid (or whatever they use for film stock these days).  Great performances, but if I never knew it was there, I wouldn't miss it - and I don't.I hope that makes sense.  The Big Lebowski certainly doesn't.",The Big Lebowski
252,TheEtherWalk,Funny nonsense,10,27 January 2004,"This movie is hilarious but it's difficult to put into words. There is no summary that can be made that would be less than a page. The plot twists all over with subplots ranging from a soiled rug to a porn tycoon to a kidnapping case and on and on... one reviewer put it the best when he called it 'a two hour Seinfeld episode: a movie about nothing.'Aside from the ridiculously confusing plot (i had to watch it 3 times before I understood it all), the characters are what hold this movie together. Hilarious performances by John Goodman, John Turturro and others make this well worth the headaches. 9/10",The Big Lebowski
253,FrankBooth_DeLarge,"A surefire comedy, this film is pure genius",10,27 January 2005,"The Big Lebowski is a brilliant comedy, but it also has a very unique plot. If you liked Fargo, you might also like this because it involves a simple plot, but involves several incidents that add to the story and make it funnier as it goes.There are several unique characters like the artist played by Julianne Moore, the Hispanic bowler named Jesus played by John Turturro, and one of my favorite characters is the boisterous bowler named Walter, who is played by John Goodman. The story is centered around a lowlife bowler named Jeff Lebowski, or 'the dude' as everyone calls him. One day his house is broken into and his beloved carpet is soiled, all because he was mistaken for a multimillionaire with the same last name as him. He tries to get help from the Big Lebowski, but doesn't get anything, until the big Lebowki needs help and the Dude and his bowling buddies decide to assist him. The result is an entertaining and wickedly hilarious trip to regaining the dude's prized possession.The plot is simple at first, until it gets more complex. The film requires more viewings to appreciate everything, but there is still plenty to like the first time you see it, such as the humor, the camera angle shown through the finger hole of a bowling ball, and the clever dream sequences. See this film once to be entertained, but see it several other times to realize the genius that was involved in it.",The Big Lebowski
254,blazesnakes9,I'm not Mr. Lebowski. You're Mr. Lebowksi. I'm the Dude.,8,27 July 2014,"The Coen brothers' movies never cease to amazed me. From Blood Simple to Raising Arizona, these two cinematic geniuses always made me laugh and also enlightened me in any situation they put on the big screen. Yet even in the slightest sense sometimes, their stories can be twisted, but hilarious. And after seeing The Big Lebowski twice on DVD, I can finally sit down and write a critical review of the movie.The story takes place in Los Angeles in the year 1991. Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski, (Jeff Bridges), is not your average movie hero. In fact, the Narrator, (Sam Elliot), tells us in the beginning of the movie that the Dude is considered the laziest man in Los Angeles. He's a loner, a loser and a fan of drinking White Russians. The Dude also has friends like his bowling buddies, Walter Sobchak, (John Goodman), an angry Vietnam veteran, and Donny, (Steve Bucemi), an simpleton who doesn't seem to pay attention to somebody's conversations. When the Dude is ambushed at his home, he realizes that the guys who assaulted him got the wrong man. He soon finds out that there's a another man who has the same name, Jeffery Lebowski, (David Huddleston). The big Lebowski, (Huddleston), wants the Dude to find his kidnapped wife after receiving a ransom note from the kidnappers. So, the Dude and Walter decides to bring the ransom money to the kidnappers since they were given instructions from them. Unfortunately, this doesn't go as planned. The Dude and Walter failed to bring the money and as a result, the Dude receives news that the culprits cut off her toe. With evidence pending, The Dude decides to investigate the mystery along with Walter as the story deepens into bizarre twists and turns involving a porno king, (Ben Gazzara), who uses the Dude to star in one of his films.After seeing this movie twice, I started to figure out why this movie became a cult movie of its own. And I think I know why. Most movies consists on telling stories that have a meaning to it. The plot can be either straight forwarded or filled with many twists and turns. There isn't really any meaning to The Big Lebowski. Maybe audiences are tired of seeing movies that are predictable or recycled. In fact, I am also one of those people who can't stand watching films that are recycled from the screenplay factory. The Coen brothers don't fall into that specific category. These two men can write sharp and witty dialogue. Some might even compare this movie to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. What these two movies have in common is, yes, they are set in the City of Angels, but also to make a point, the way the characters in both movies talk in such a way that it's sounds screwy and also funny at the same time. It's rare today to see films that are dialogue-driven. I know for a fact that some audience members don't like too much dialogue. I can understand that statement. But, dialogue doesn't hurt. It certainly doesn't.Out of all of the characters that the Coen brothers has written in their films, I have to say that the Dude is, perhaps, the best well-written character that they could come up with. In many ways, The Dude lives by his own rules and doesn't seem to pay attention to the world around him. When he has to investigates the kidnapping, he does his way rather than stopping and looking over the specific details that are involved in the crime. It's almost as if he consumes most of the evidence through his brain and finally after so many complications, he finally understands what is going on. On the other hand, Walter is also like the Dude. Walter is, unlike the Dude, a Vietnam veteran who doesn't like to be wrong on the things that he does, yet he thinks he's being blame for the wrongdoings that he did while serving in Vietnam, hence his repeated line, ""Am I wrong?"". Another similarity is that he and the Dude are somehow stuck in the early 90's. They think they are still living in the 60's. Jeff Bridges is wonderful as the Dude. He brings a lot of heart into his character. He makes the Dude likable because of his on-screen presence. John Goodman is very funny as Walter, the angry Vietnam veteran who reluctantly agrees to help the Dude with his investigation. Among the supporting performers are Julianne Moore as Lebowski's daughter, who specializes in pornography. John Turturro is also well casted as Jesus, the gay Latino bowler who is always eyeing the Dude, Walter and Donny, since they are competing him in a bowling tournament. And I wouldn't want to leave out Phillip Seymour Hoffman's and Julianne Moore's performances. Those two performers did a very good job portraying their own characters with sharp writing.What I also like about the movie is the bowling aspect. This is a very good movie about bowling even though it is a not sports movie. But furthermore, The Big Lebowski is also an ambitious movie that tries to crammed as much as it could because they are so many things going throughout the entire movie. You have a mystery, a kidnapping, a bowling tournament, an investigation, pornography, a rug that the Dude owns that had been peed on, and German nihilists. How could one movie fit all of this in? Well, ambition is the key and so is the writing that drives this movie altogether. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",The Big Lebowski
255,tubby1,Original but too quirky.,6,22 February 2010,"The Coen brother's The Big Lebowski is a quirky, odd-ball comedy which succeeds in providing original characters and scenes of comedic wit. However, the eccentricities at times are too outlandish, and frustrates the viewing experience.The film follows 'The Dude' played by Jeff Bridges who is mistaken for a rich-namesake. The consequence of this mistaken identity leads The Dude and his psychotic-friend Walter Sobchak on a journey of double-cross and bewilderment.The film is creative and supplies a number of good one-liners. On the whole you are happy to go along with the oddity of the story. The Lebowski's one big drawback is its rather impeding 'dream sequences', which are rather ill-fitting. Without these dream sequences the film would have flowed a lot better. However, instead it leaves you aghast at the incongruity of there inclusion. These moments together with other eccentric creations shift the Big Lebowski's strength as a story.Without doubt Jon Goodman is the star of the film. Jon Goodman's character Walter Sobchak is a somewhat Jekyl and Hyde individual. Walter's actions and words are the underlying strength of the film. His predominantly psychopathic ex-Vietnam vet reactions contorted with his apparent intellectual mind make him one of the most memorable characters. Unfortunately, Steve Buscemi role as 'Donny' is more the opposite and I disliked the gimmicky inclusion of the character.The Big Lebowski is not an altogether bad film. Jon Goodman provides a great performance which invigorates the story, but the Coen's quirkiness was just a little too overbearing for me and I felt at times an unnecessary distraction.",The Big Lebowski
256,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,9,20 May 2013,"I, usually, don't watch the same movie several times. However, The Big Lebowski is a big exception to that rule. Very loosely based on real people and stories, this movie is full of details, subtle references and jokes. In fact, it's impossible to catch them all in just one viewing. Every time I watch this masterpiece, I always find something new. Thus, the Big Lebowski has the biggest re-watch value I've ever seen in a movie. Another astonishing thing is that almost all of the dialogue in the movie (besides one sentence that was ad-libbed) was written in the script. Which is fascinating since the F-word or a variation of the F-word is used 292 times; the word ""dude"" is used around 161 times and The Dude says the word 'man' 147 times through the movie. With these two elements in mind, there is no doubt that the Coen brothers are absolutely marvelous screenwriters. And The Big Lebowski is their best movie to date.The Big Lebowski is a movie about an everyday lazy hippie-like guy named Jeffrey Lebowski aka The Dude. His misfortune starts when two thugs, mistaking him for another man, also named Jeffrey Lebowski and who is a millionaire, enter his house and try to extort money from him. They also pee on his rug. When they eventually realise they entered the wrong house, they just pick up and leave. The Dude, furious about his rug being destroyed, decides to take the whole situation to the millionaire Lebowski. From this moment on, one complication after another erupts. And the Dude gets involved in all kind of activities. The movie's narration is very film noir-esque: the movie follows the Dude in every scene and he serves as the audience's guide through the story. As a matter of fact, the movie's plot and characters somewhat follow the classic novel/movie The Big Sleep.Since the movie's plot, just like the one from The Big Sleep, can get complicated from time to time, one may find oneself, during the first viewing, in a position where trying to follow every subplot means missing the small details that make this movie so perfect. Not that it is wrong, but in order to fully appreciate the appeal of The Big Lebowski, repeated viewings are an absolute necessary; especially since The Big Lebowski is ultimately a comedy and much of the humour is in the details. The characters also a very strong aspect of the movie. There is plenty of them and each and everyone is memorable and great. Like I said before, the characters, and some of the situations they get into, are based on real life people (and their stories) the Coen brothers met in their lifetime. This unusual combination of real life absurd situations and film noir structure is what makes The Big Lebowski so unique and enjoyable.The Big Lebowski really has a cult status, it is generally adored by both critics and the audience. It even has its own multy-city festival, Lebowski fest. It can easily be found on most of the best comedies of all time lists. It also spawned one of my favourite soundtrack albums (featuring names like Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, Captain Beefheart and Elvis Costello, among others). Speaking of music, the bassist of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Flea, also has a role in the movie. And The Big Lebowski features a fictional German electro band named Autobahn, which is clearly a homage to Kraftwerk – I found that to be a really nice touch. The only problem I have with the movie is the opening narration by Sam Elliott, which seems too pointless and long and it never suited me. Besides that, everything is top notch. It's a definite recommendation. Now if you would excuse me, I have to go make myself a White Russian.Rating: 9/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",The Big Lebowski

I just think it works better when their quirky humor is counterbalanced with some disturbing violence (as in Fargo and No Country For Old Men). The latter is missing in The Big Lebowski. The humor is strong, DoP Deakins does a great job but for me the star of the show is Jeff Bridges as The Dude. Never before or after did Bridges played a more memorable role. It is his performance that makes it an enjoyable film.",The Big Lebowski
258,williambendavis-933-218958,Simply awesome,8,5 April 2015,"This film is quite good. Every character is freaking awesome and the dialogue is simply golden. The one character everyone knows, The Dude, is easily the highlight of this movie. He's a lazy, easygoing guy who just likes to sit back and let life happen. When he gets mixed up into a crazy, complex plot, the results are quite amusing. The second best character is Walter, a foul mouthed, angry, Vietnam veteran. He makes for some hilarious and memorable scenes. The plot to this movie is kind of all over the place. It's never hard to follow or anything, but it is everywhere. I can see people making the argument that is was a really lazy to put such little effort into the plot. If that's your opinion, I won't argue with you. However, I will disagree with you. I'd say lots of effort was put into this plot. It seems that a lot of time was put into making it so it could be complex if it wanted to, but simple if looked at from a certain point of view. That lines up perfectly with the character of The Dude. He makes the plot seem that way. He only focuses on what he cares about and ignores everything else. That is actually quite brilliant and I give major points to the Coen brothers on that one. In the end, The Big Lebowski is a hilarious film, and should be seen by everyone.",The Big Lebowski

Not so far, at least! John Goodman was also great if not the funniest character in this movie! His character is just brilliant!

All in that in a movie, the answer is ""The Big Lebowski"". ""The Big Lebowski"" not only can be one of the best films of the Coen brothers, but also as one of the funniest movies ever made. The Coens once again manage to put all his humor and intellect in a comedy written and directed as well. Everything in the movie sound Coen material, the story itself is. When the unforgettable ""The Dude Lebowski"" (Jeff Bridges) is mistaken for a millionaire with the same surname ""Lebowski"", two thugs urinate on his rug to force him to pay a debt he did not even know. Dude seeks and finds the other ""Lebowski"" (David Huddleston), not only earned a reward for the ruined rug and also accepts a job at one time as pay-off. Dude then asks the help of his bowling buddy Walter (John Goodman), a gun-toting converted to Judaism with serious anger issues. The little work leads to a huge mess which leads to more trouble, and soon seems that everyone from the porn empire tycoons and improvised criminals want something from The Dude. The whole movie is full of Coen elements. Black humor, moments of absurd violence, but it is never a negative point in the Coen films, but a great talent, especially in its big-black comedy. And as always a fantastic direction from Joel Coen (director) with amazing shots of scenes (one example is a scene where we see the bowling ball inside of it running). And the writing as always very strong in delivering extremely funny and smart dialogs. Leaving the movie extremely entertaining to watch.

Giving Jeff Bridges his signature role, this mixes bowling, kidnapping (of course), German porn, nihilism, modern art and Julianne Moore's vagina (of course) to make a surreal pot pourri of complete incomprehension.  The film starts with a tumblin' tumbleweed...well, why not?  A Stranger turns up to dispense advice from under a stetson...okay.  One character has a completely unexpected fatal heart attack...fine.

But like many of the Coen Brothers films that I have watched I either like them or I don't.The ones that I liked usually have a strong story behind them, the ones that I don't like seem to be more of a ""day in the life of"" story about people who really don't seem to matter and about events that no one really cares about.Maybe there is some type of amusement in trivial matters, making bored college frat boys feel more intelligent then they really are, but I need something deeper for intellectual stimulation.For my comedy, I don't need slapstick or pie in the face humor to make me laugh. Cynicism, witty dialogue, sarcasm, commentary and so on, not one line random events that happen out of no where with no real context and then expected to be funny.(which is not to say that slapstick pie in the face humor doesn't make me laugh at times...) A very random film with very to little no substance to it. A few quirky one liners here and there, but in all honesty I was more looking at the clock waiting for this film to end then I was looking at the film waiting for it to be entertaining.Yet for some reason it has a cult following and there it is...

271,Det_McNulty,Allegory For My Life,10,16 October 2007,"Overtly based on Raymond Chandler's classic novel ""The Big Sleep"", The Big Lebowski is my favourite work from the Coen Brothers, along with Miller's Crossing. When released in 1998 cinema-goers were baffled by the film, with most viewers not being able to even gather an opinion. However, once the film was available for purchase a cult following began to emerge, which has given birth to the annual Lebowski Fest and a so-called religion named ""Dudeism."" The world of Lebowski has become an element of modern pop-culture, while Jeff Bridge's character ""The Dude"" has developed into an icon of apathy. His days are spent bowling, drinking, experiencing occasional acid flashbacks and delving in pacifism.Conducting an exhaustingly (and intentionally) complex tale of a trophy wife's kidnapping, The Big Lebowski puts fourth a crime story as a means of making everything about the picture even more ludicrous than its characters. You see, the Coen Brothers routinely craft films concerning characters that have become swathed in absurdist situations. This is an ulterior motive; a means of clashing wacky diversities with an impelling sense of convolution. The Big Lebowski is about characters that are blissfully unaware of the complications which arouse due to their erratic behaviour. Jeff Bridge's protagonist The Dude (a.k.a. Jeffrey Lebowski) becomes apart of a kidnapping plot by accident. He unwittingly stumbles across the scheme after a contextual naming error, in which two house-breaking thugs urinate on his rug. In response The Dude seeks compensation from the intended victim who happens to carry the same name, hence the confusion. As you can see, I am rambling and could do with a ""Caucasian"" cocktail.The Big Lebowski has been apart of my life for many years now; I recall lapping up the dialogue to such an extent that I would unintentionally quote the film during everyday conversations and I still do. This boils down to a screenplay which will retain its status as one of the finest ever written. By no means is the script artificial or plagiarised, instead the breathtaking originality of it came as a breath of fresh air to the QT-laden dialogue which circulated throughout the independent cinema of the '90s. Exemplifying imagination and entertainment is the aim of The Big Lebowski; dumb, half-witted nonsense is not what the film illustrates, as some people have wrongly accused it of being. Oh, and I must not disregard a clear and present fact; Jeff Bridges offers one of the greatest performances of all-time.Do not dismiss this masterpiece as a senseless twaddle, as that would be an unfair accusation for such a multi-layered outing in confrontational, elaborate humour. This is comedy as an art form, and so is conducted on an ambitious scale of subtly intelligent, foul-mouthed wit. Except this is a farce crafted on a mesmerising scale of ingenuity and radiating charm. Characters like Walter Sobchak, Donny Kerabatsos, Jesus Quintana and of course the German nihilists are irrefutable creations of hypocritical hilarity. Throughout the picture The Dude encounters a vast array of sarcastically written characters, which are effectively caricatures of combined personalities. Stylistically, the film is crammed to the brim with stunning film-making procedures (e.g. the Jackie Treehorn section) which accentuate the confrontational wackiness of what could be hailed as a ""warped homage to film-noir."" For a film of the '90s, the soundtrack is punctuated with retro rock & roll from forgotten eras and in essence identifies a ""hippy"" stance.It might be worth noting that this review is just my opinion, man. Even so, that should not stop you from viewing a film which is destined to be regarded as something not just of the '90s, but of today's culture, too. Remember: abide by The Dude's -rational, whether you like it or not- philosophies. Simply take each day as it comes and try not to live in the past, stranger.",The Big Lebowski

274,jckruize,The Dude abides.,9,2 September 2003,"Criminally under-utilized and overlooked actor Jeff Bridges shines here as 'The Dude' in this magnificent shaggy dog tale by the talented Coen brothers that improves in hilarity with every viewing.  The Dude is a truly inspired creation -- as far from your standard-issue hero as you'll ever find.  In fact, to be blunt, he's a lazy, drug-addled, feeble slob.  But his heart is good, his instincts true, and his shuffling persistence in the pursuit of justice is a wonder to behold.As usual, the Coens' regular supporting cast of loonies is perfection, with co-star John Goodman a standout as the John Milius-inspired Vietnam vet with a chip on his shoulder the size of Gibraltar.The plot doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense, with many bizarre stops along the way, weird bits of business, oddball musical fantasy interludes and bursts of manic action that will most assuredly test the attention spans of the straightlaced and unimaginative.

After the mishap, he seeks reparations for his rug that was soiled in the process, only to find himself strewn in the mess even further.The Coen Brothers are masters of their craft, creating a genre-busting film with witty dialogue, comedic irony, subversions of expectation, a perfect soundtrack, and acting that gives life to the characters.

Anytime a movie takes place in between the years of 1970-1994 its got my attention. Its also a comedy. I am a comedy freak. I love comedy, comedy is my life. This is real comedy, the funny stuff. One thing I love about this movie that I haven't heard anybody else say is that the movie had thee perfect music to it. Fantastic music throughout the whole film. My favorite characters were The Dude (Of course) Walter and Donny. I am a fan of all three of the actors who played those parts, Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi. Poor Donny was always being told to shut up by Walter. The Dude was mixed up in the other Jeffery Lebowski's problems and Walter threw his undies out the car window and wants them back from those Nazis. Those three pal's sport was bowling. I've actually enjoy it as well. Some other people I had noticed in the movie were Tara Reid as Bunny, Dom Irrera as the driver and Jack Kehler as Marty. I'm also fans of them. To wrap this whole thing up I want to say if you haven't seen this movie and you want to see a great comedy about a guy whos just trying to get by in life, watch The Big Lebowski starring Jeff Bridges.",The Big Lebowski
277,HanShotFirstGR,Best stoner movie of all-time!,10,24 April 2021,"Plot:Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski, mistaken for a millionaire of the same name, seeks restitution for his ruined rug and enlists his bowling buddies to help get it.Analysis:Being a person who doesn't like Coen's humour, I hadn't watched The Big Lebowski until recently. Despite going into this movie very sceptical it quickly made me relax and enjoy a simple story with a few brilliant moments. It's one of those movies that I think you will probably love if you are high while you 're watching it, there are some very cheap but totally entertaining jokes that can attract both the most demanding and the most casual fans.I have a love/hate relationship with their work but this one was an absolutely charming comedy. The casual dialogue they can write to highlight hillarious circumstances is probably the most important element here. Although, the characters are not quite developed or well-written, they become memorable through the great interractions they have. The greatest example is The Dude, he could be a very generic main character but if you think about it he is not and that's because you can observe his personality in every scene he's in. Something simillar Coen tried with Burn After Reading, they tried to turn small-talk into character presentation without being able to achieve what they did with The Big Lebowski. All in all, a well-written screenplay and definetely among their best works.The success this movie met would not be possible without the amazing performances of Jeff Bridges as The Dude and John Goodman as Walter. Despite the absence of an intriguing plot that would make this an interesting experience, those two characters maximize the entertainment levels, they are hillarious together and seperately, they have amazing chemistry and both actors elevate this movie to something very worth-watching.The major problem I could spot is that all the scenes that don't make you laugh are way too awkward. Although most of the scenes work fine, there are quite many of them that actually do more harm than good. Uninteresting sub-plots, characters that add nothing to the overall entertainment and weird scenes that you can't understand why they included them, those are some very controversial choices that didn't actually help the film at all and made the whole experience less exciting than it could've been. This is still a very good movie, it just could be a perfect one if they stick to the humour that worked quite well.Conclusion:One of the best movies Ethan and Joel Coen offered us, a memorable comedy that I plan to rewatch every 4/20 for the obvious reasons. Although I am not 100% ready to call it masterpiece, The Dude and Walter made this an extremely fun experience so I would probably recommend it to everyone.Rating: 8.5/10.",The Big Lebowski

His pacific nature, along with his friends (who can be polar opposites at times) are lovable characters who all love to bowl. But in all seriousness, this movie revolves around the misfortune(s) of Lebowski: a lovable passive man who just wants to enjoy life, but is put in a whirlwind instead. From the bowling alleys to the bridges, going on this adventure is constant excitement and joy. You can't help but smile to see the Dude take what life has to throw at him in the best way he can. Lebowski is quite the man, and this movie's highs (literally) and lows certainly prove it is more than just another dull comedy. Watching this movie even after hearing about all its reviews, I was still quite impressed in every aspect of the film. Whether it just be scenes of playing at the lanes, or taking a relaxing drive outside, I can't overemphasize how much I enjoyed this film.

281,darkjosh,Can A Film With Bowling In It Be This Hilarious?,9,4 November 2000,"The Coen brothers prove their aptness at creating quirky, wonderfully engaging, and often hilarious characters as well as snappy dialogue between them.  The Big Lebowski is a well-written, off-beat comedy filled with gut-busting scenes of absurdity and charm.The Big Lebowski stars Jeff Bridges as Lebowski, or as he prefers to be called, ""The Dude.""  When he is mistaken as another Lebowski (millionaire Lebowski), he stumbles into a kidnapping, ransom, money-laundering plot between millionaire Lebowski and a group of Nihilists.  In between this, he takes the time to go bowling with buddies John Goodman and Steve Buscemi.Jeff Bridges' hilarious Dude is a wonderful amalgam of laziness and low-key wit.  His performance is marvelously engaging and entertaining with Bridges making his character slovenly, meandering, but ultimately an all-around nice guy.  John Goodman gives one of his best comedic performances to date as the Dude's whacked out, extremist, Jewish 'Nam buddy.  He and Steve Buscemi's harsh scenes create a caustic and very funny chemistry.The dream sequences are in a class by themselves - they are probably the oddest ever filmed, with Bridges getting caught in a bowling ball, a bowling ball's eye view, and an unusually militant worker at the local bowling alley.  At the very least, they will put a smile on your face.With it's quirky, off-beat characters, Jeff Bridge's brilliant comic creation that is The Dude, and a wonderfully funny supporting cast, The Big Lebowski is one of the best comedies of all time.  While the plot may not be at the same level of the Coens' other masterpiece, Fargo, it's still very enjoyable fun.

Other amazing actors in this comic farce were John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore ~ and John Turturro, an absolutely brilliant actor who has been cast in several Coen movies now, including 'Barton Fink'. It's hard to detail what this movie was about with specificity. Suffice it to say it was a supposed kidnapping adventure, intertwined with a heavy dose of bowling, and a bunch of dysfunctional friends with 'issues' trying to assist 'The Dude' out of his outrageous predicament.For its superb acting and very unique story-line, gave 'The Big Lebowski' 7* out of 10.",The Big Lebowski

With the help of his slightly psychotic friend Walter (Goodman), they do their best to solve the mysterious event. And it all started with a rug that tied the room together...Jeff Bridges as The Dude here was simply an astonishing surprise to say the least. Never would I have pictured him or even felt he was capable enough to pull off this quirky character. Hats off Dude, and sorry for underestimating you. John Goodman's performance as Walter was another pleasant surprise as the hardcore Vietnam vet who cannot forget his buddies that died face down in the muck. There's a certain chemistry between the two that would have been all but impossible to foresee before getting started. The casting crew must've known something I didn't because it really makes the film.
What more can be said of the Coen brothers? They simply know how to keep it simple yet extremely entertaining and wholly original. It is a rather short film but never lets up when it comes to the laughs and the characters. Definitely one of my favorite comedies of all time and I know I'm not alone. The dream sequences alone are worth the rental.If white trash, Vietnam vets, nihilists, bowling, and smoking jays sounds appealing to you...then this would be a wonderful addition to your film collection.

Following on the heals of the acclaimed hit Fargo, The Big Lebowski is cut from the same irreverent mold as its predecessor. It concerns the adventures of ""The Dude"", an incredibly lazy hippie bowler with no aspirations who just can't stay out of trouble. As with all Coen films, the performances and writing are first rate, especially Jeff Bridges as ""The Dude"" and John Goodman as his violently unstable bowling partner. The humor is definitely not for everybody, but the people who don't like it will probably steer clear anyway. I'll just say you'll probably find yourself laughing for all the wrong reasons.

The duo are absolutely hilarious together and seem to play flawlessly off of each other throughout the film. Steve Buscemi plays a short but funny role as the spaced out friend of the Dude and John Turturro may have well stole the show playing the over-indulgent exposer/bowler Jesus.This film contains some of the most hilarious and wacky scenes that I have seen in a long time. These include: the scene in which thugs bust into the Dude's lair and dunk his head in his toilet and then proceed to urinate all over his rug, the scene in which the Dude writes a check for 69 cents, the scene in which the Germans bust into the Dude's lair and put a Marmot into the tub with him while he is having a bath and the fight scene between the Germans and the Dude, Walter and Buscemi's character.This film worked for me in every aspect except for the lack of a plot to guide the film and the overlong ending.

Dude portrayal was astounding even dude was a hard role to play but he did it, and the supporting all took part also. the music really match with the genre of the movie.

300,eyesour,Dynamic,10,13 August 2010,"Crisp, elegant, and tightly-plotted, with no loose ends. The titular protagonist of this thriller is a heavyweight business tycoon, a Korean veteran war-hero, disabled but not crippled, with a charming daughter and a devoted second wife, famous for his charitable enterprises. He has an alias, who might be known as the Sherlock Holmes of Los Angeles, an amateur gentleman sleuth with the professional well-honed acumen of someone with a naturally keen intellect. This is no dud, but a man of intrepid action, ably supported by the Alley Irregulars, a couple of great-hearted associates who help him solve the mysteries at the centre of the epic, and who bravely face up to a gang of demented blackmailers and foul extortionists. There are many twists and turns and surprises along the way. What was the significance of the phantom kidnapping? How did the Hollywood big-shot producer get involved? Why did the Police Chief put his hat on before throwing a right hook? Why was the central piece de resistance of the tastefully furnished, state-of-the-art apartment micturated upon? At the end, you know there was something down there. The acting throughout this gripping tale is stellar, the dialogue is courteous and refined, but unfailingly witty. There are a number of dream sequences, reminiscent of Salvador Dali, possibly owing something to Alfred Hitchcock in one of his more surreal moods. Two animals, a marmot and a Pomeranian, play significant roles as the enigma unravels. Several forensic crime investigators are called in. There is also a sagacious narrator, acting as a sort of Greek chorus, lucidly explaining the intricacies of the background to the interplay of the characters.Make sure you see this masterpiece before you die. It's right up there with Chainsaw-a-Go-Go, and Bimbo Cheerleaders from Outer Space.Nought out of four found this review useful? I love this movie, and have watched it countless times!

301,MadReviewer,"The Dude Abides, and Walter Rules",8,29 April 2001,"`The Big Lebowski' is a strange, funny film that occasionally struggles for coherence -- fortunately, this lack of coherence is usually part of its charm.  It's the story of The Dude (Jeff Bridges), also known as Jeff Lebowski, an amiable stoner trying to cruise through life on the path of least resistance.  The Dude's world is ruined one day, though, by a bunch of thugs who break into his apartment, beat him up, ruin his favorite rug . . . and realize that they've assaulted the wrong Jeff Lebowski.  The thugs were actually looking to pummel Jeff Lebowski (David Huddleston) the millionaire industrialist, who's up to his neck in trouble with organized crime.Since he was beaten up unfairly, and since his prized rug has been ruined, The Dude decides to seek compensation from this `other' Jeff Lebowski.  What follows from there is a wild tale involving kidnapping, modern art, pornography, bowling, and German nihilists.  In other words, it's another wickedly funny movie from Joel and Ethan Coen.Jeff Bridges is great as The Dude, an affable, easy-going guy who constantly struggles to do what he thinks is right throughout the film . . . even if his idea of what's right is sometimes slightly warped.  The best character of the film, though, is The Dude's best friend Walter Sobchak, as played by John Goodman.  How Goodman's portrayal of Walter failed to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, let alone even get nominated for one, is downright criminal.  Walter is a walking, talking, ticking time bomb, all sorts of contradictory rage rolled up into an extremely unstable package.  Walter likes to think of himself as this calm, all-knowing voice of reason, but deep down he knows he's not, and that makes him all the angrier. Watch how Walter belittles his other friend Donnie (Steve Buscemi) for Donnie's politically incorrect use of the term `Chinamen' -- and then watch shortly thereafter how Walter personally describes a group of German nihilists. It's nothing short of comic brilliance.  (Also worth noting -- Tara Reid has a very small role as `Bunny' Lebowski, but she also has the best line in the entire film.  Don't miss it.)  `The Big Lebowski' is a character-driven film, heavily reliant on the quirks and reactions of its characters to make it work.  Well, not only do the performances in the film make `The Big Lebowski' work, but they make it work magnificently.Visually, `The Big Lebowski' is one of the Coen Brothers' best; there's a loving, sweeping series of glorious shots used for the bowling sequences that are offbeat, original, and highly effective.  (There's also a point-of-view shot from inside a bowling bowl that works to great effect.) The weakest part of `Lebowski' is the actual story -- parts of the plot thread involving the German nihilists, while funny,   are often pointless and don't add much to the rest of the film.  Also, some plot threads either vanish altogether partway during the film or are never satisfactorily resolved.  That, however, is a by-product of one of the `The Big Lebowski's' overall recurring themes --'The Dude Abides.'  The Dud is easygoing enough to deal with any situation, no matter how weird or random it might be. Unfortunately, by giving the Dude weird and random situations to deal with, the overall story loses focus.  It's not a major enough problem to drag the film down significantly, but it's enough to keep a good film from becoming great.Rent it, if only to see the tour du force performance of Jon Goodman.  A bizarre and downright funny movie.  Grade: B+/A-",The Big Lebowski

It seems to me that some fans of the Coen brothers' work are split on a number of their films, and this is no exception. But ""The Big Lebowski"" is a slice of life in L.A. and despite it's surreal surroundings, seems to be all too real.The Coen Brothers have stated that this film is much closer to reality and truth than ""Fargo"" ever was. And if you're not already in on the joke, ""Fargo"" was stated to be a true story at the beginning, later to be revealed as a fictitious one, for those who stayed for the end credits.""The Big Lebowski"" is filled with outrageous characters, memorable dialogue, and a twisting plot, ""lotta ins, lotta outs"" as Jeff Bridge's ""Dude"" would put it. The only disappointment is we don't get to see more of the flamboyant Quintana ""Jesus"" who likes to bowl maybe a bit too much, played by John Turturro, and Steve Buscemi's character ""Donny"" who doesn't seem to know what's going on most of the time, which annoys John Goodman's gun-toting ""Walter"" perpetually.No one can fairly accuse Joel & Ethan of not trying different things and producing quality work which clearly comes from two men who love film and are dedicated to a vision and then execute it beautifully.

The acting is great and the directing has a level of meticulousness and polish to be admired.It has a way of making a simple story needlessly complex and adds unresolved plot threads on top of unresolved plot threads with a badge of honor.

309,johnmschofield,I will always regard this film as one of my favourites,10,9 March 2010,A film buff friend of mine recommended this film to me some years ago and his opinion is generally quite sound. This is the sort of film that I could watch every week and still find it superb entertainment. The film is an absolute barrel of fun throughout and the cast and crew together with the Coen brothers have produced a masterpiece. When the Monty Python experience came along in the late 1960's my dad and I used to watch it together. I was almost always helpless with laughter whereas my dad had various expressions on his face from bewilderment to boredom and suffice to say he never did not see the funny side of Python. This is another instance where he would probably be watching this film with a stony face unable or unwilling to grasp what would be so funny to me. Yes there is violence and sexual content but in my opinion it is all in context and not gratuitous but thats just my two cents. Like in a lot of other comedy films you either like them or not and I suspect that there are quite a number of people out there who just cant tune into the humour. I am fortunate in that I can tune in and apart from anything else this film stands on its own and not just a comedic exercise but as a fun story with a reasonable plot told in an unique way. I would highly recommend anyone watch this film because in my opinion there is so much to like and hopefully if you tune in you will not be disappointed,The Big Lebowski

315,robsellke,"Hilarious, brilliant, well-written, but confusing",9,29 August 2000,"""The Big Lebowski"" is one of my favorite comedies of all time.

One night he comes home to goons who dunk him in his toilet and pee on his rug.  They leave when they find out that the man they're trying to get money from is a different Lebowski, a millionaire (Dave Huddleston) whose wife owes money all over town.  Dude goes to Lebowski's house and takes a rug, despite Lebowski's rage at Dude for being a slacker.  From there on, the movie gets more and more confusing, with more and more plot twists and characters added.

316,a666333,"starts nowhere, goes nowhere and not funny",2,1 May 2019,"This is a cut and paste mishmash of caricatures and stereotypes (as most Coen movies are). The shame is that the caricatures are awkward and insult one's intelligence as well as the targets of the caricatures. They even manage to insult and degrade 1930s musicals. All that might be partially forgivable if it was funny but it never gets past the cringe stage. As for the story. There really isn't one. There is just an excuse to wander from one absurd, meaningless, barely coherent scene to the next. In one sense, it is truly post modern, i.e. there is no meaning, no theme other than impossible, dysfunctional characters thrown together to no purpose and you cannot feel good about any of it or take away anything useful from watching them.Critics and people in the industry seem to give not just the benefit of the doubt to the Coen brothers. Any paint they throw at a wall is hyped and sold as some kind of high art. But there might be method to that madness. If this kind of thing can be elevated to high art, it allows anything slapped together with a splash to be likewise elevated. In the mean time, movies as an art form and a cultural expression are down graded again while presumably the profits continue to flow. If that is what is going on, then this movie starts to make sense.The only redeeming things I can see about this movie is that John Goodman tried to do something with the wretched material he was given and Sam Elliot just manages to maintain his dignity as the writing and directing attempts to drag him down into ridiculousness. But if I think about it too long, I might conclude that they became caricatures of themselves. Again, that might be forgivable if it was funny, but it isn't.As for Jeff Bridges, he seems to be deliberately trying to act badly, i.e. blatantly artificial. To what end, I am not sure. Did the directors want that? Possibly, the Coen brothers have certainly used unnatural characters before.Did Juliane Moore enjoy her incomprehensible role? It didn't make sense even in the vacuous context of the movie.Please don't fall for the hype. See garbage for what it is. This is not classic or significant in any positive sense.",The Big Lebowski

How, then, is it so entertaining?Jeff Bridges holds the thing together like glue.  He plays the unflappable Dude -- who gets flapped aplenty -- with such wit and grace that he pulls off plenty of schtick, making this cartoon utterly believable and convincing.  (Oh ho! -- he writes checks for less than a dollar!  He smokes a joint and says ""bummer""!  He lives to bowl and yet never rolls!)  The Coens were dead right to cast Bridges; any actor who misstepped would have sunk the ship.Even still, a quarter or more of the scenes don't work, but what does is very entertaining, very funny.

I find ""The Big Lebowski"" to be, not simply a very funny movie (one of the funniest I've seen), but also a damn good movie in terms of character, story, plot, and themes.  So few people are interested in making good comedies anymore.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is like a gift from heaven. This movie is the rare combination of a film which I can rewatch endlessly, I always find something to make me laugh out loud (it's never the same thing twice), and actually holds up rather well to close scrutiny.  It's a wonderful goofball version of a standard 1950s film noir, updated, of course, and never taken seriously.  But all the elements are there.  It's a terrific spoof of detective movie, but it actually functions successfully as a detective movie.  [Compare to ""Airplane"", which is a riotously funny spoof of airplane disaster movies, but only works as a spoof, not as an airplane disaster movie.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is making fun of detective movies, but it also has a real mystery involved, and a real detective (albeit an unusual one) who actually solves the mystery.]    Great performances make this film, and the cast is to die for.

321,Craig-9,This film is truly an under-rated gem! A classic!,10,8 August 2000,"As I look over the other comments for the Coen Brothers' film, _The Big Lebowski_, I see that I am not alone in my appreciation.  When I first saw this film in the theater, it was a bit of a let-down, coming on the heels of the brilliant _Fargo_ (one of the greatest American films of the last 20 years, and that's no understatement).  But when I first rented it on home video, I was sucked in by the charm and the atmosphere of the film. 
It has such a laid-back, easygoing style that I can see how it might not appeal to those looking for nonstop action.  But if you're willing to surrender to the peculiar charms of this film, you too might begin to see it for the work of genius it is.  I've since purchased the film on video and have watched it several more times--it really is a film that grows on you and it is hilarious to boot.  John Goodman has never been better than in the role of the insufferable Walter, who knows everything and will never admit he's wrong, even when he clearly is.  But he's a true friend to the Dude, played by Jeff Bridges, and Donny, played by Steve Buscemi.  The three of them are bowling buddies, and in the course of preparing for the big tournament, they get pulled into a weird little mixup involving a carpet, a wayward wife, and the Big Lebowski, who just happens to have the same name as Bridge's character.I've seen this described elsewhere as a sort of anti-mystery and that's one way of enjoying it.  Imagine Jeff Bridges as a sort of stoned, clueless Philip Marlowe, stumbling through his investigation.  The comedy though is just so relaxed and unforced, unlike that in the Coens' _Raising Arizona_, a film I've never been able to watch.  The acting in this film is amazing, with a cast of independent film allstars.  The more I think about it, the more I wonder if this film might not be just that much better than _Fargo_.  If not, it's a very close second.  If you rent the film and it doesn't appeal to you at first, give it a chance--you might find that it grows on you, too.",The Big Lebowski

323,claudemercure,"Mess, featuring tasty bits",7,23 August 2002,"What probably happened was, the Coen brothers had a bunch of cool visual and story ideas they didn't know what to do with, and they decided to make a movie out of these disparate elements. The result is a bit of a mess. You can just hear the Coens saying, ""Hey, what if there was this guy who's the ultimate slacker? And what if there were these guys who thought they were nihilists but were just a bunch of pathetic poseurs with exaggerated German accents who played geeky German electronic music on a puny ghetto blaster? What if-"" - by this point they're already laughing themselves silly, and they're right: this stuff is very funny. But it doesn't add up to anything.This is easily their most disjointed film (their only disjointed film, actually), and their least involving. But it's worth seeing once, if only for the wonderfully conceived central character (Jeff Bridges in a pitch-perfect performance); for Steve Buscemi's skillful, subtly hilarious puppy-dog performance; and for moments such as the narrator saying near film's end that ""it's good to know the Dude's out there"", a statement made humorous by the fact that the main character couldn't be less of a hero.",The Big Lebowski

Steve is absolutely, stunningly wonderful! And of course, John Goodman is, once again, one of our ten best actors. The most suprising element of this film is how good Jeff Bridges is in this. Why this movie did not get the critical acclamation that Barton Fink and Fargo got, escapes me completely. I truly enjoyed this movie and would highly recommend it. Most poignant for me was the archetypical hypocrisy of the 'can do' right wing doppelganger of 'the dude', which is seemingly self-evident to the general public or it wouldn't have been characterised with such nonchalance.

If this movie can get an average rating of 8.2 then by that logic 'The Pineapple express' too should be up here within the confines of the IMDb top 250.

The reason for this is not clear but obviously they mistook him for a different guy with the same name, The 'Big' Lebowski, who's enormously well off and sits in a wheel-chair. Some kind of revenge or threat. Anyhow, they pee on the hippie namesake's oriental rug. And thus the story starts rolling.Now, if you know anything about rugs you'd know that you can actually wash off pee. It's done regularly in Iran where almost every home is furnished up the walls in hand manufactured rugs and carpets, and where young kids might pee, or worse, on them.This picture, on the other hand, is not washable. After seeing it a dozen of times, I still don't get what it's all about.The story is too blurry and unintelligible to summarize.It's entertaining, though, and the soundtrack is great.I get the feeling that the Coen Bros really wanted to impress Tarantino, as TBL could well have been a comic book story, just like Pulp Fiction.",The Big Lebowski

When I first saw it I was laughing so much that I found myself wondering just what the hell it was all about. Then I watched it a few more times and wondered just what the hell it was all about. Actually, it is a very finely crafted movie even if it looks as if they were running out of film and just tied everything up in the last reel. I am so glad it came out on DVD as it gives you the opportunity to pick up other bits and pieces that seem almost secondary (well, actually they are but who cares). Like in the opening scene where the Dude's head is shoved down the toilet after he bashed his bowling ball against the door jam. If you notice the dent left is still there all through the film. It's a small thing but one that make the whole movie a gem. Jeff Bridges IS the Dude (and a biliiant piece of acting to explain to the Big Labowski that she (Bunny) kidnaped herself). Both Goodman and Stevie are perfectly cast and Johnny T. is just perfect as the Jesus. Like Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"", this movie bases itself in a sport for which I have no interest but, boy, what a movie. I have to give this 9 out of 10 as it is only the Coen's second best movie.

328,janus-20,"Very rewarding, if you allow it to be, thats just......y'know, my opinion man.",10,6 February 2012,"The Big Lebowski is a movie which requires repeat viewings, to appreciate the characters situations and the humour which comes from their reactions or lack thereof, to these situations. The Dude is a manipulated man, the Coens have manipulated a man, to whom getting up and going to the toilet is far more a concept, than a reality.They have placed a reluctant, anti-hero in the middle of a plot he is forced to participate in. The characters he encounters within the story manipulate him, all for their own selfish ends and many moralise at him whilst they are pursuing their own nefarious schemes.The Dude abides this treatment, either through inability to challenge it, verbally or physically or in some cases through lack of understanding he is being manipulated. But as he endures the films indignities, he never wavers and in the end returns to his normal pattern of living. Whereas the go getters, the schemers, the users, the pro-active people have all been undone by the own machinations, hoisted by their own petards. The Dude is vindicated in his lifestyle, by default.We are all asked to participate to some degree in our everyday lives in the plotting or social mores of others we feel we have to answer to, the Dude reminds us to step back from time to time and let the cards fall where they may. Control, through opting out, thats why we love the Dude and thats why the Dude, is the Dude !",The Big Lebowski
329,carlo_simone18,Black Comedy at its finest,9,9 February 2018,"In a film that combines so many plot elements including a ransom, nihilism, a stolen car - and of course bowling - it's quite amazing that it works as well as it does. The script by the Coen brothers is rather complex, but it's really satisfying to see how 'The Dude' becomes further and further embroiled in the affairs of different groups and higher powers in Los Angeles.Jeff Bridges encapsulates the character of 'The Dude' (I struggle to picture anyone else who could portray him so well). John Goodman's performance as Walter Sobchak is also very strong, and the dynamic between him and 'The Dude' is very engaging. This is complimented by an unorthodox script which creates some very entertaining dialogue, as well as some finely-interwoven humour.The direction is also solid, with the cinematography of Roger Deakins being beautifully smooth, particularly in the shots at the bowling complex. It is immensely satisfying to take it all in.",The Big Lebowski

331,dragonshield,A fine piece of quality comedy entertainment,9,15 July 2007,"""The Big Lebowski"" is a hilarious movie. It makes you laugh scene after a scene and that makes it a fine piece of quality comedy. It has a rather bizarre story which sometimes gets a bit silly, but it's still enjoyable all the way through. The story tells about a man named Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski. He is accidentally mistaken for a millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski and this leads him to things he wouldn't want to have experienced. With his bowling buddy Walter's help he tries to get things right but is constantly failed in his tasks, mainly because of Walter's strange personality and anger issues.The best thing about this film is the characters and the role performances done by the actors. The characters are just great, they're vivid and they all have odd personalities and different ways of interacting. Jeff Bridges plays the character of ""The Dude"", a total looser who would have preferred bowling instead the things he accidentally mixes up with. Bridges is so real in the role, though the character itself is so surreal, sort of an ignoring person who pretty much defines stupidity. Although Bridges is superb in the role I thought John Goodman was more entertaining in the role of Walter Sobchak. The character of Walter is just so bizarre. He is a Vietnam veteran who constantly deals with his anger issues and thinks he's right when it comes to solving things, yet being pretty much wrong in every case. Trying to help ""The Dude"" he just makes things worse and doesn't even admit that he's been wrong. I've never really found John Goodman as entertaining as in this movie, so thumbs up for that. There are also other characters worth mentioning; The always enjoyable Steve Buscemi as Theodore Donald 'Donny' Kerabatsos who never seems to be able to speak up his mind as he is always bothered by Walter. Being a bowling buddy of ""The Dude"" and Walter he still remains as one member of the group and there is some sympathy showed towards him in the end. Julianna Moore is also in a so surreal role, the role of Maude Lebowski who is obsessed with sex, the British daughter of the real millionaire Lebowski. We also see for example Philip Seymor Hoffman and Peter Stormare in one of the roles.The screenplay's very well written, written by Ethan and Joel Cohen it definitely mixes up everything from the beginning till the end. This what also makes the plot a bit confusing at parts. You really need concentration, as there is constantly this fast dialog between the characters and it's just impossible to know what is important for the plot and what is not. There is just so much fillings in the dialogs that it gets a bit messy. The directing pretty much does the same, directed by Joel Cohen. It can be described from what I described the plot and the dialogs. Being precise, entertaining and swift it also blends up with the story so well, making the whole movie this one big entity where the main theme is never lost. Although it does get a bit confusing it's still that definite quality and you just can't go wrong with that.""The Big Lebowski"" is a good movie, it's nothing phenomenal but it's definitely something worth watching if you don't want to watch something that serious, as it just does include these irrelevant and silly, yet hilarious parts which in their way are simply one crucial part of the movie. You will laugh, if not because of the great jokes or the dialog, then the odd silliness it has inside it. Great characters, superb role performances, a plot that evolves to something you couldn't have imagined and a guaranteed laugh-packed ride. ""The Big Lebowski"" does what it needs to, it doesn't have to exceed that.",The Big Lebowski

Some of the predicaments were humorous, but the characters just weren't likable. I love John Goodman but his character was a psycho that didn't have very many great lines. Buscemi's talent was just wasted. I found The Dude to be stupid and clueless and how he survives each day is mind boggling.I did enjoy some of the characters and they were funny, but nothing near what I read from reviews.

335,shusei,"Boring, pretentious,and highly overated",2,26 March 2018,"To make long story short, I don't understand what really matters in this film.
The plot is rather simple, a lazy jobless middle-aged man living in Los Angels gets in trouble only because his name is identical to the another man who looks a millionaire but in fact lives by the money of the foundation that he represents.
The plot may become interesting if the main characters have more concrete biography and have a will to live their life in such so that it would become better than the total wasting of time.
But what the authors made of the plot is the contrary. No one of the characters has a will to live otherwise, that is, they want to live only as lazy dogs with no positive or creative purpose. Their sense of justice and sense of duty is lower than average , their desire to have a lot of money without working is not motivated by any thought-out view of the world, and as a result they look very flat and boring people. 
Here the simple plot is played by very boring people and authors' effort to make simple boring story look interesting resulted in an empty demonstration of cheep and disconnected images (visions of daydreams of the main character).
Sorry, but I feel no sympathy for dose lazy and healthy guys only playing but not living.",The Big Lebowski

338,serafinogm,Enjoyed most of the movie but did not appreciate the neocon propaganda peppered throughout!,7,9 October 2015,"Think what you want of Saddam (I think of him as a traitor to his people) but the fact is he was a paid CIA employee dating back to 1959 (probably earlier), when he was part of a CIA-authorized six-man squad tasked with assassinating then Iraqi Prime Minister Gen Abd al-Karim Qasim (who was an asshole as well but he was our asshole until he made a fatal mistake and he in CIA terms had to go). The first attempt failed but eventually in February 1963 Qasim was killed in a Baath Party coup which was followed by an orgy of bloodshed. The leftists were all murdered and the lists of those to be killed were supplied by the CIA! Saddam eventually became dictator of Iraq and we played him like an instrument. George Bush Sr. needed to look strong so April Glaspie, (our Ambassador to Iraq) when approached by Saddam regarding Kuwait invited him to invade Kuwait by stating the following: ""We have no opinion on your Arab-Arab conflicts, such as your dispute with Kuwait. Secretary Baker has directed me to emphasize the instruction, first given to Iraq in the 1960s, that the Kuwait issue is not associated with America."" We were setting him up to make Bush Sr. look like a strong leader. Anyone who spent the least amount of time reading between the lines knew this at the time, yet a horrible slaughter ensued that was so freaking unnecessary, but hey ""money trumps peace"" (quote from George Bush Jr.), in reality actually it's really more than just money! Okay enough of my rant to sum it up I loved the movie but cringed at the unnecessary propaganda that conveniently predated the release of the PNAC position paper! The performances were magnificent especially Jeff and John. I encourage everyone to watch it but be aware it's really a propaganda piece designed to get you ready for the next Iraq war!

340,foxhound-37781,Absolute waste of good actors....,1,29 November 2020,"I'm not going to waste time explaining the plot because its the bare minimum of what you can even call a plot to begin with....Seriously this movie has great actors in it, but they were obviously just after an easy cash grab when they all decided to accept their roles for this movie, because all their acting talents are just completely and utterly thrown into a trash compactor and squashed up into a tiny cube. Even Flea (The bass player from the chilli peppers) plays a small role in this but would have been much more worthwhile to just stick to being a bass player than waste time on idiotic side projects like this...Why this movie has the cult following it does is beyond me. It literally must be for people who like movies that require no train of thought and dialogue that's riddled with F-bombs, and there are plenty on display especially from John Goodman's character.And what was the point of this movie having a Narrator? Were the Coen brothers just testing the water for Tommy Lee Jones character in No Country For Old Men. They continually use Narrators in their films when they are films that FLAT OUT DO NOT NEED NARRATORS! It's supposed to be a movie, not a wildlife documentary. You're not watching an episode of David Attenborough so drop it with the god damn narrators!!!All in all, I simply can't recommend this movie, it's full of pointless dialogue, annoying characters, great actors that have been degraded beyond hell and a bunch of non funny jokes that just don't fit where they belong.

341,alexsnower,A very good comedy,9,26 June 2021,"The Coen Brothers were inspired to make a comedic spin of the 1946 film ""The Big Sleep"" starring Humphrey Bogart. Instead of a competent detective however, they got a incompetent bowler thrown into the situation. The funniest thing is instead of smoking cigarettes like Humphrey in ""The Big Sleep"", the dude smokes joints. Walter played by John Goodman is also excellent. Every scene he is in is practically carried by him (Pulling a gun on Smokey, the money drop at the bridge, fighting the nihilists). His constant unrelated reminders that he saw his buddies die face down in the mud in Vietnam are also very funny. The supporting cast does good too (Buschemi, Seymour-Hoffman, Moore).

347,jwcstorage,Its just not good,3,26 April 2021,"I know this will get a lot of downvotes but... this movie is not good.I've tried. About six times now, I've seen The Big Lebowski, either most or in whole, and each time I wonder what people see in this movie.It is was never particularly amusing, rarely eliciting even the thought of ""Oh, that was funny"" much less an actual chuckle. The plot isnt really engaging, as it just sort of meanders through the content. The dialogue that is often lauded, is rather weak throughout the movie, with only a few of the scenes that have been meme'd to death being some of the few ""high"" points. The plot... exists.On a technical side, the sound isnt anything really praise-worthy, though I'm sure a lot of people will note the soundtrack itself, but that is addressed below.Nor is the cinematography worth mentioning with many shots being flat/center, with an occasional dolly shot thrown in to mix things up. Even when they had a chance to make things a little more 'wild', most of the shots are still flat/center (like the Dudes bowling dream sequence).The sound track feels almost ""obvious"", with certain choices feeling like they picked the most overly used choices they could find, or a close approximation.The clothing looks good/like a bunch of Goodwill stuff bought the day before shooting, which is what they were going for sure, but the only thing that shines here is the set design.Each locations ""feels"" right for its place in the story. The bowling alley is straight outta middle America, the Dudes house not only looks small, dingy, and in disrepair, but the overall choices for what went into the house clearly had a lot of thought put into it. When set design is a standout in your movie, somethings wrong. The only negative is that they made the overall space, especially the livingroom, a bit too spacious for someone like the Dude to actually have, but that is just a minor niggle.The acting is........ fine. It is not great, or even particularly good, per se, but the actors do their jobs well. Many of the characters feel one or two dimensional at best, with others being a single trait in human form. Even the Dude himself isnt much other than a stereotype of a 'cool loser' type.As stated, the few highs are whats already been meme'd to death, and even before that, they were more 'kooky/crazy/shocking' than actually amusing.(For example, John Goodman pulling a gun over a bowling foul was never amusing, but the scene following it, where they are having a conversation in the car as the cops rush the place, WAS slightly amusing, but could have been done to better effect)It does its best to get to the next scenes pretty quickly, which is a blessing in disguise, but it doesnt do even that in any particularly engaging manner either.I know this is a big favorite amongst the 420 crowd and certain others, and by all means keep enjoying this movie.I have tried many times to find merit in this film, even with perception altering legal substances, but its always been an extremely overrated film imho. I wish I could find what others see in this flick, but its just not there for me.Many people have stated this as their favorite movie. I've heard many different angles on why people enjoy it, but I still do not see what they do.Logjammin' was a better movie than The Big Lebowski.Sorry, everyone.Its just not a good movie.",The Big Lebowski

Perhaps the two most prominent of these people are Joel and Ethan Coen, creators of such masterpieces of 'Fargo' and 'Blood Simple'.  While most of their previous work has been critically acclaimed, it wasn't truly until 'Fargo' that the pair became more universally known.  'The Big Lebowski' is proof that the duo have past a rare test.  They have transferred their concept of quirky filmmaking to the mainstream, while retaining their biting sense of humor.

He's always careless and takes nothing to his heart.

The dude is such a shameless person, that his story and style can remind me of people's stereotyped, dull and ignorant behaviors. If you identify with the dude's personality, this movie will make you think about whether you're reacting too aggressively and emotionally at times, that at the most of these times, you don't have to give a dam about things.

To start this movie takes a simple complication and just keeps on piling on complication after complication that eventually we would suspect the story would become very complicated and hard to follow, but in The Big Lebowski, the main characters don't seem to be affected by all these situations and complications, some would say this is bad story-telling, but the fact that the main characters acknowledge the difficulties and try to solve them as best they can, and being people who are just going where the wind takes them in life you would think that the whole story would end up the same way even if they weren't there but no it is the exact opposite. Anyway, onto my verdict of the story, coming from the minds of the Coen brothers they managed to create a dark, witty and hilarious story with twists and bumps causing the story to become so detailed yet with a real tone, not a film-real tone a real down to earth tone, i still can't comprehend how they managed to do it. This story will keep you entertained and thinking for weeks, therefore the story gets a pass from me. Onto direction, i thoroughly enjoy the Coen brothers style and in The Big Lebowski it really worked, giving us the exact angle we needed, and entertaining us with beautiful shots with dialogue that will not soon be forgotten.

I think maybe coming up with the idea of 2 Jeff Lebowski's of very different personas might make you think you have a gem of an idea for a movie. I can see why people think the dialogue is clever/genius, but I found myself somewhat exhausted with having to explain to myself what was going on and repeating the lines/things in my head and saying ""see that is why that is funny"" and so on and so forth. It just wasn't naturally amusing, fleshed out the way it maybe could have, and required a lot of effort and in-your-head translation of sorts. This movie never appealed to me and I've avoided it over the years which I am usually correct in doing. This is my 4th or 5th viewing and it is still very tiresome and no I have not laughed once. I mean, I love Jeff Bridges, so I keep watching. But I can't praise this movie like so many people do. I find myself repeatedly wondering what the writers were trying to accomplish and that maybe it wasn't accomplished by the actors, or something. Maybe it was better accomplished in writing than it was in film. I do not know. I mean... I'm not stupid, I get the jokes... and I have smiled a lot watching this, but there is much about it that is tiresome/draining. Maybe I am just looking too hard for something after all the praise I have heard.

As such, the jokes may not go over well with everybody.  But rarely have I seen such a well-done comedy with such well-placed, memorable quotes.To name a few: ""This aggression will not stand, man.""  ""But they're amateurs.""  ""Leads?  Yeah, I'll just check with the guys in the crime lab downtown.  They've got four more detectives working on the case.  Leads!"" ""That's not her toe, dude.""  ""Papers . . . business papers.""

All recognizable and well-loved by those who've seen this many times._The Big Lebowski_ most likely derives its title from the 1940s film-noir _The Big Sleep_, considering that each have a meandering plot, though _The Big Lebowski_ is of the comedic, laid-back variety (laid-back, just like the Dude) where you really needn't complain about the plot or lack thereof.

370,mark-4522,"There are uptight folks out there who don't get it, but they will. Or not.",10,11 June 2014,"For fun, I wondered who would give this film a no star. I find it fascinating that when I see a great film and others see a terrible one, a Battlefield Earth, what causes the discrepancy? Is it perhaps they're humorless or lack the capacity to ""get it?"" The investigation was interesting. The reviewers seemed articulate much of the time and not mere trolls. Yet, they hated the Dude. The whole thing. Every character. They were bored. They felt it was stupid.So perhaps here's why a few people can't ""get"" the Dude: They just don't like him. They didn't like the characters. The nihilists ordering ""piggie in the blankets"" or a Vietnam vet whose converted to Judaism and watches his ex-wife's dog. The film has a wonderful backstory that invites you to fill in the gaps with similar characters in your own life and fiction. It's full of rich details but if you don't like one, or more, of the characters, then it's like listening to colleagues you dislike at work prattle on about their facebook posts. They don't get it and don't care and just want to leave.The genius of the film is that many people who don't see the humor on the first viewing a few years later see it again, perhaps on TV as their spouse or friend is watching it, and realize: ""I missed that the first time around. That's pretty funny and insightful."" Then they watch some more. Then more. Then they're hooked.The Dude is not for the faint of heart. You would NOT want the Dude to move in with you. He'd burn down the house because he forgot to turn off the oven but, hey, stop being so fascist about it will ya? But even if you want some distance between you and him, you come to love him and his troupe of characters that are simultaneously stereotypes, both in fiction and real life, and at the same time unique characters in their own right. The Dude says you need to stop being so uptight, relax, and get it. Or not. And when someone gets uptight and doesn't get it, they don't get it. And they are the ones who write 0 star reviews of this film on IMDb.A few years down the road, they'll have a few drinks in them and relax and watch it and then they'll change. Maybe they'll fix their 0 star IMDb review. Maybe they'll apologize to the Dude but the Dude is OK with that. He has far more important things to do.",The Big Lebowski
371,Sonic_Ocean,"For once, a movie that feels like real life",10,28 May 2013,"What I think makes 'The Big Lebowski' so great is its attitude and outlook on life and how it can easily resonate with people, especially with a non-confrontational attitude like 'The Dude.' In a world where we try to over-rationalize everything until we don't realize we're creating an altogether new problem which is a byproduct of an already existing issue, 'The Dude' makes everyone else look like a cartoon character or a caricature. To quote what the cowboy said which is basically we all need a hero for its time and place, or I don't know, I kinda forgot what he said. Umm.. Something to that effect.What makes the movie great is you see this guy who gets placed in this sticky situation and how he gets tangled up with all these characters being the opposite with the obvious, Walter, who happens to be his buddy. To see these characters tick is just plain hilarious. And what is also great is watching The Dude just floating through every conversation and every conflict inadvertently making almost everyone else out to be taking themselves too seriously. I did not see the point about the film the first time due to being delirious from working, but upon my second viewing of the film, I found it funny in a way that resonated with my outlook on life.I think we all yearn to be stoic in the same manner as The Dude, especially in a world in which a lot of people have their head stuck up their asses. To take no bullshit without feeling the need to protect a huge ego is an attribute that everyone should try to aspire to. 'The Big Lebowski' to me is not only a great comedy, but a great film that feels so human and I cannot help but smile with laughter and feel a sense of warmth from watching it. When there are so many characters in movies that feel like they are from an unattainable fantasy dream, we cannot help but alienated from them, and to have a film like 'The Big Lebowski' to bring these characters back down to a human level makes a movie that feels like real life, and at its core, is what makes this film a classic and a film that has a home in my heart forever.",The Big Lebowski

In fact, recently I rented it out for a week and watched it every night for three consecutive nights (a tad obsessive by anyone's standards, maybe - but it still had me rolling about each time). Those who find it stupid, boring, for potheads only, etc... well, I can only feel sorry for them. They're missing something fundamental.

374,KnightLander,"""Obviously you're not a golfer.""",8,18 March 2006,"To me, the greatest thing about the Coen brothers is how vastly different each of their films is. For example, after making the dark, dramatic ""Fargo"", they made this film - ""The Big Lebowski"", a comedy about a stoner who gets his rug stolen. What other filmmakers would make such a leap from film to film, and continuing doing so through all of their films? Only the Coen brothers.""The Big Lebowski"" stars Jeff Bridges as Jeffrey Lebowski, an unemployed man known to everyone as ""The Dude"". His life revolves around the nights spent bowling with his buddies Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goodman), the latter of which is an easily upset Vietnam vet. Life is good for The Dude - until two thugs beat him up and pee on his rug, mistaking him for a different Jeffrey Lebowski. The Dude goes to visit ""the Big Lebowski"" (David Huddleston) and tells him about it. Shortly thereafter, The Dude is beat up by three people he's never met, then ordered by the Big Lebowski to be the courier in an exchange - the Big Lebowski's wife, Bunny (a young Tara Reid) has just been kidnapped. From there on, things get worse and worse for The Dude. How he's gonna get himself out of it is anyone's guess.""The Big Lebowski"" is really a fantastic film. There is a well-written, clever, and funny script - which isn't really a surprise from the Coen brothers. Great directing and cinematography (the latter by Roger Deakins), particularly during some wonderfully quirky dream sequences. There's also a really cool soundtrack, featuring Bob Dylan, CCR, and more.But what would the film be without the cast? Jeff Bridges is really great and funny as The Dude. The real highlight of the cast is probably John Goodman, who is absolutely hilarious as The Dude's over-the-top best friend. There's also good performances from Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, David Huddleston, and Sam Elliott. Coen brothers favorites Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, and Peter Stormmare also appear.As I've said, the thing that is most appealing about the Coen brothers are the differences between each of their films. ""The Big Lebowski"" is one of their very best. It's a stoner movie - and it's one of the best movies ever made. Watch it, dude. You won't regret it.",The Big Lebowski
375,garydiamond,Much more than just a comedy - a genre-spanning masterwork.,8,8 September 2006,"It's a rare thing when movies like this come along. It's the kind of picture where you'll either marvel at the highly woven plot and genre-hopping genius, or deplore it for being a completely random, stupid and unfathomable piece of crap.The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is an iconic, laconic slacker. Instantly likable, the Dude's own slant on life is that most things can be solved by taking it easy or going bowling. His partners in crime are Walter; a deranged 'Nam verteran (John Goodman in superb scene-stealing form), Donny, one of his bowling buddies (Steve Buscemi in an understated role) and David Huddleston as the title character, complete with assistant Brandt (Philip Seymour Hoffman, turning the smarm right up to ten). What starts as a simple case of mistaken identity and damaged property quickly becomes a roller-coaster tale of backstabbing and caricature characterisation which gets faster and more twisted as it reaches the final minutes.The first time I saw this I must say, it just seemed ludicrous and not at all humorous. I wasn't really sure whether it wanted to be a comedy or a surreal drama. After getting about two thirds of the way through I got up and walked out, convinced that this was the worst film in the Coen brothers canon. But on a second viewing I stopped taking this film too seriously and it was then the offbeat comedy and plot really came together.Ingenious, hilarious and unexpected you really don't have a clue what is going to happen, but the direction and cinematography make it seem like it was inevitable all along.

However, the Coens did make Hudsucker Proxy and I did not really like that. So, you can believe me when I say this is one of the greatest comedies ever. Right up there with Raising Arizona (that Coen brother thing again). To sum it up simply, the Dude has a rug that really ties the room together. It gets miterated upon by some guys looking for Bunny. But, Bunny is not the Dude's wife. Oh yeah, some Nihilists are also looking for Bunny. They believe in nothing. Walt is going to help Dude get his rug ( a new one) back and find several analogies to the Vietnam war to sum up what is going on. The Dude does get a rug, but it was Maude's rug, Bunny's stepdaughter, but don't call her that. Oh yeah, Maude will have Dude's baby after her assistants beat the Dude up. Even though the Dude would prefer getting together with Bunny (she was in Logjamming), but Brandt does a good job of preventing that. Oh yeah, the Nihilists cut the toe off one of their girlfriends, they pretend that it is Bunny's toe, so they can get ransom from the Big Lebowski, who is not the Dude. Donny sadly dies, the Little Lebowski urban achievers lose out on a million dollars, Dude gets the Credence back, but the car is totaled. Is this helping? Or should I stop?",The Big Lebowski
377,ProperCharlie,I keep treating objects as women...,8,17 February 2002,"One way to classify yourself as a film-goer is by identifying your favourite Coen Brothers movie.  I believe that in the future this will be a universal standard and all reviews will being with the reviewers preference is brackets under the title.  For example you might get (Fargo but closely followed by The Man Who Wasn't There or Miller's Crossing!!!).  This would enable everybody to make snap judgements on whether to read the review or not.I would imagine the Big Lebowski followers would be very much like the Dude. The go through life avoiding conflict and find it real hard to remember what the movie was all about afterwards.  Consequently their reviews will never be scathing but slightly lacking in detail.This films is a reaaaallllly relaxed Coen Brothers effort, following the Dude around the bowling alleys of Los Angeles in the early 90's.  Much to the Dude's dismay, he gets mixed up in an affair involving nihilists, ex-porn stars and conceptual artists that results in a soiled rug and a run in with a marmot.  Jeff Bridges is excellent in the role of the Dude and right now I can't help feeling this is going to be the part he's going to be associated with for the rest of this acting life.  The rest of the cast are just as superb notably John Goodman and Julianne Moore.I think the keep to this films success is the way the audience associates with the Dude.  He trundles through the film trying to work out what is going on while keep a certain distance from events which is pretty much what I was trying to do while sitting in the cinema.  This trick makes this possibly the most accessible Coen Brothers film to date and it's thoroughly recommended to everyone.Go see(The Hudsucker Proxy just over Fargo.)",The Big Lebowski

The whole plot line with Julianne Moore as some weird bizarre sex artist should have been cut. Her acting is just bad.There's too many scenes in the bowling alley with John Goodman taking over the scenes with his loud brash presence. I forget Phillip Seymour Hoffman was in this but it might be worst performance ever.

379,YellowTea,"A ""Nothing"" Movie With a Quiet Charm",7,12 September 2021,"I'd long heard about The Big Lebowski, rave reviews in fact. It was roundly dubbed as one of the few ""movies that you must see before you die."" It has apparently even spawned a legitimate religion, or ""way of life"", called Dudeism, based around the central character, The Dude. I thought to myself, any movie that can spawn a religion, or movement, surely must be worth watching. Now, I wouldn't say that it's not worth watching, but I wouldn't consider it one of the greatest movies of all time. As the title of this review states, it's not without its charm and does have moments that will make you laugh - several of the scenes with The Dude come to mind, such as when he's in the bathtub and the German nihilists break in and toss a ""marmot"" (was that a marmot or a ferret?) in with him. Jeff Bridges' girlish screams are real chucklers. In addition to this scene, I would also list The Dude's speech patterns and mannerisms as being part of the successful comedic devices. I didn't much care for John Goodman's character, or any of the others. This movie really was all about The Dude, and the others added very little to the film. Julianne Moore's role was just plain dumb and there only to add a dash of sex appeal and toilet humor.In truth, if you don't like Dude Where's My Car, I don't see why you would like this, and vice versa.Overall, I'd say that this movie is good for a watch on a lazy night in bed, if even for just some background noise. I wouldn't deign to confer the grading of masterpiece upon it. It has inspired me to try White Russians.A stupid feel-good movie that I don't believe fully deserves the praise it received.

It is not FARGO - it is a comedy with a great deal of surrealism. There are no higher moral issues and no lessons to be learned (besides: never spread the earthly remains (ashes) of your friend against the wind!).The three main characters are all great. John Goodman is perfectly cast as the ""can't-get-over-it Vietnam vet"" Walther and the scene where he jumps out of a speeding car with a Uzi in order to pursue the kidnappers is slapstick at its best.The best scenes though are the ones with The Dude, Walther and Donny arguing what to do with The Dudes personal problems.

The problem for me is that this movie is NOT classic material, because it does not age well. In fact, I could not watch more than ten minutes of it on the second attempted viewing. Perhaps the problem was the fact that I lost count of the number of F-bombs in the first few minutes. When the opening dialog would be incomprehensible if all the obscenities were bleeped, you know you have a problem. When the slutty wife of the rich Lebowski (as opposed to Jeff Bridges' character) offers a ""bl*w job"" for $1000, it's no longer funny to me - it just makes me squirm.

He is mistaken for a much wealthier Lebowski, who's wife owes money and thus gets everyone in trouble. The resulting hijinks involve ransom, German Nihilists, and bowling.This film, more than any other by the Coens, seems to have generated more cult followers, quotes, party themes, and Halloween costumes. It's unique, funny as hell, and has a strange plot. The characters are like your college dorm-mates - memorable and goofy.There is a sober, philosophical side to the Big Lebowski too.

It turns out he gets way more than he bargained for; agreeing to find the millionaire's young wife, who has gone missing. It turns out he is not the only one looking for this woman or the ransom money. The Dude encounters an eccentric cast of characters, from the millionaire's daughter (Moore) to a gang of German Nihilists (including Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea).The story is extremely wacky which lead to lots of hilarity in some scenes. The best part is that the film never takes itself seriously, its more of a dark comedy than anything else. The glue of the film for me is the great pairing of Bridges and Goodman. Goodman's character constantly looks to associate every situation with the Vietnam war. Bridges is brilliant because of his laid-back appearance, including a robe and sandals.However the story seems to hit a few snags along the way and for me makes the film far from perfect. These snags for me are segments that seem to make the film drag a bit, time-wise. There seem to be too many characters that pop-up and then we are forced to revisit them later in the film.In conclusion, its a great dark comedy that doesn't follow conventional plot lines, a Cohen brothers trademark.

Lebowski (not to be confused with that Mr. Lebowski), is one of the most interesting characters in cinema, a jobless drifter who has nothing going on with his life, mistakenly placed amongst people and a society that does not appreciate the beauty of his character. The film portrays a nihilistic view on life, a showcase of how meaningless life is, just like the drama and conflicts that unfolds in the story. The life Lebowski leads might not appeal to everyone, but we should all learn a thing or two from the the way he speaks, deeply rooted in a socially unacceptable philosophy that upon second thought yields more happiness than most. Why take life so seriously when deep down it is such a amorphous ridiculous mess that points nowhere? Do you agree with Lebowski? How can you apply his philosophies in real life where the stakes both smaller and higher than in Lebowski's fictional world of 90s LA? These are only a few of the questions this film inspire in its audience. In a weird way, The Big Lebowski makes for quite a touching film, and the way it does so is to make you reevaluate the attitude with which you lived your life until then. How is the truth about life, hidden in plain sight, so simple and yet so easily shunned?Coen brother's directorion and Deakin's cinematography are both highlights, but in this film I find the script and character study more intriguing. After all, it is what this film's enduring legacy is built on, and from which a cult following and even a so called religion engendered. The Coen's brothers eye for the folly of society and the frustrated human condition shines in this modern classic. They write dialogue that is rich with dark humor and subverts clichés to deftly convey underlying messages. The Big Lebowski is another one of those definitive Coen films - subversive, funny, dark, thought provoking, perhaps even an exemplar at that. An endless revisitable film with so much character and a timeless message",The Big Lebowski

If you have seen it, ever tried explaining to your friends what this movie is about? Somehow I never manage to really capture the essence of this flick, which is part of the attraction I suppose. Of course, there is the basic 'story' line about a guy whose rug has been stolen by some nihilists who hold him for someone else having the same name, but to be honest that storyline only serves to piece together the incredibly funny scenes that make up this movie. Oh boy do I wish I had some of the laid-back-ness The Dude possesses. Bridges is your parents' nightmare, and lovable for that. Goodman and his never-ending flirtations with Jewish Religion and Vietnam are so utterly ridiculous without ever being offensive, hilarious! Then there is Donny, a marvel in his own right. The nihilists, Lebowski's daughter Maude and her vaginal art, her gayer than gay house friend Anton, The Jesus in his purple shiny training suit, The Dude's landlord / neighbour, the list is almost endless. This movie walks the good side of the thin line where cheap stop-or-I'll-shoot humor Leslie Nielsen style flicks occupy the opposite side.Watch it, watch it again, have a ball talking about it with your friends, then watch it again together, you won't be disappointed, it's a killer movie.

Such a twisty, entertaining and hilarious plot with literally every actor/actress giving some of the best performances of their lives. As usual for the Coen brothers, the cinematography, soundtrack and direction are all wonderful. At the same time ""The Big Lebowski"" is a paean to Hollywood, LA noir (a sub-genre with some excellent precedents), greed, and selflessness.You can watch this film on many levels - pure entertainment, a deeper set of character studies, and even a parable on American society that holds true to this day.The Dude is an iconic character and worth watching TBL for alone, but there is so much else going on that - if you haven't already seen it - I won't spoil for you. If I have any advice to offer, it's don't read any reviews or plot summaries prior to watching for the first time. I wish there were movies like this still being made.Also, by no means are the following films the same as TBL, but you might like them if you enjoy this.* Chinatown* Inherent Vice* Under the Silver Lake* L. A. Confidential* Mulholland Drive* Kiss Kiss Bang Bang* After Dark, My Sweet* The Long Goodbye* Brick.",The Big Lebowski
392,geoaar,Coen Brothers at their best,8,16 February 2004,"I loved this movie.The offbeat humor, the oddball characters, the dream sequences, and the intermittent philosophical musings of the mysterious stranger (Sam Elliot) all worked together to make a thoroughly enjoyable movie.
While I didn't ""get"" FARGO, the Coen brothers crafted a movie here that I wish I'd made myself. It's really a gem...",The Big Lebowski
393,charbrom,obviously you're not a golfer,9,25 March 2001,"This fabulous comedy by the Coen-brothers only keeps getting better and better the more times you see it. Bridges is perfectly cast as 'The Dude', the easy-going, laid-back kind of guy who spends his time bowling, smoking weed and listening to his Creedance-tapes. Goodman as Vietnam-veteran Walter who sees a conspiracy in almost everything and doesn't want to be bothered on ""his"" Jewish holidays comes up with another great performance as well as Buscemi, Moore, Seymour Hoffman and Turturro (in a very small, but entertaining role as bowling-king Jesus). And then there is Elliott as The Stranger who says he hasn't heard of a story as stupifying as this one. I couldn't agree more. Great writing, superb acting and a terrifying marmot!!!",The Big Lebowski
394,gbrumburgh-1,A total Coen Brothers misfire. I was bowled over by how bad it was.,2,17 August 2002,"Agreed, the enormously popular Coen Brothers are an acquired taste.  And the David Lynches of quirky slapstick must be considered a hit-and-miss affair, but diehard fans are almost always left hungry for more.In the indigestible ""The Big Lebowski"", however, somebody REALLY forgot to tell the boys that off-the-wall just for the sake of off-the-wall can REALLY be bad.  Like the equally indulgent and incomprehensible ""Mulholland Drive,"" this so-called entertainment misses at every step -- as spoof, satire, revenge comedy, whatever.Check out ""Raising Arizona"" and ""Fargo"" to see real genius at work. Unfortunately, the Bros took a total sabbatical from creative filmmaking when they locked horns on this one.  I guess the success of ""Fargo"" went SO to their heads that they decided to test their core fans.  Are we now SO cool and SO popular that we can pass anything off as long as its weird? 
Obviously, from the looks of things, they can.  Oh, please, IMDB people -- this ""film"" is BOTTOM ""250"", not TOP ""250"" material.  It reminds me of the time back in the 1970s when Paul McCartney wagered that he too could throw out anything musically and have the gullible public eating it up.  And so he did.  He composed a new pop tune using the lyrics of ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"", of all things, and earned his next solid hit.  Ugh!  I fear for the future of mankind when stuff like this happens. A thuddingly dull, incoherent mess that purports to be a quirky comedy, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, who play bowling teammates, are the primary victims of this highway robbery.  Sad too, because this could have been Goodman's night to shine (as he did in ""Raising Arizona"") and, God bless 'em, he does give it both barrels, but what can you do when you're given blanks? Always the professional, Goodman tries to act cool...like he's in on the insanity.  A sleazy Bridges too rolls with the punches as a pothead slacker named Dude who through a series of mistaken identities finds a way of making make some quick dough involving a porno king and mobsters.How can such a dazzling, eclectic cast, who are perfect for this peculiar type of movie fodder, be so abominably misused?  Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, Peter (""Fargo"") Stormare, Ben Gazzara, and David Huddleston in the title role are such pros and come off looking like rank amateurs.  The last vignette with narrator Sam Elliott on a barstool is the capper. Terrible...just terrible.There are two reasons only why I gave this ""BOMB"" a ""2"" out of ""10"" instead of ""1"".  John Turturro as a creepy bowler named Jesus literally comes out of nowhere and demonstrates the Coen Brothers at full potential. His freakishly hilarious scene (which, of course, makes no sense whatsover) shows exactly what can happen when the Bros assert themselves.The other reason is sentimental.  Much of the action takes place at the Hollywood Lanes on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, California, where I use to bowl every Monday night.  I loved that place as it holds many fond memories.  Out of nowhere the district decided to tear the place down in the summer of 2002 to make room for a school.  Opposers, like myself, felt it was a landmark and deserved to be protected.  Anyway, it's gone now.
The good news:  Any time I get nostalgic for the old bowling center, I can always rent out ""The Big Lebowski.""  The bad news:  I have to rent out ""The Big Lebowski.""",The Big Lebowski
395,pjmuck,"Entertaining but ""slight"" Coen Bros. fare",7,20 July 2003,"I have long been a fan of the Coen Brothers films, and I admit I was hugely disappointed with the Big Lebowski when I first saw it in the theaters, especially since it was the Coen's first film release since  the incredible Fargo and many viewers (like myself) had high expectations.
So I avoided viewing it again for a few years until I got the urge to complete my Coen Bros. video collection and I hoped that with the passing of some time my opinion would change. It did for the better.Granted, The Big Lebowski is still no Fargo, and I still think granting this film a higher rating than far better Coen films is awfully gratuitous, but at least it can be viewed and appreciated on it's own terms now instead of having the critical and commercial triumph of Fargo looming overhead. Unlike films such as Fargo, Barton Fink, or Oh Brother, Lebowski plays as a loose, far less structured, and meticulous affair. The Coen Bros. quirkness abounds, but seems to be devised more for pure pleasure than imagery of any deeper, metaphorical meaning. This actually makes it unique among Coen Bros. films, because one gets the sense that they just wanted to make a straight forward (for them, at least) comedy about a character thrusted in a weird predicament that's incongruous to his persona. It does seem to play a bit forced, however, as if the Coens felt that they needed to uphold their trademark stylizations, and the dialogue does get a bit wordy and tiresome after a while. It entertains on a fairly basic surface level, whereas other films in the Coen catalog (such as Barton Fink) have an incredible amount of depth and are far more thought provoking. There's nothing cryptic or profound here, the depth of the film lies in the filmmaker's vision and the character development, but not so in a storyline with any underlying hidden meanings or moral lessons.Overall an entertaining and engaging film, but definitely not the best Coen Bros. film nor ""the funniest film ever made"".",The Big Lebowski
396,tuomas_gimli,Gets better with every viewing,9,2 January 2013,"The Big Lebowski is simply a joy to watch, and gets better with every viewing. There's simply so much to see, from the absurd musical sequences to the sociopathic behavior of John Goodman's character Walter Sobchak. Just trying to make sense of the convoluted and completely ridiculous plot is a game onto itself. The movie has an enormous amount of quotable lines and the dialogue is some of the Coen brothers' finest.The characters are all imaginative and memorable, with Jeff Bridges and John Goodman wrestling for the best part. Goodman's Walter Sobchak is easily one of the most unsympathetic and frankly crazy Vietnam-vet characters in cinema, what with him constantly referring to his battles in Vietnam or spouting obscenities at everyone in sight. But Bridges' the Dude is just as charming: writing a cheque of 0,69$, crashing his car after dropping a joint on his lap and constantly drinking white russians. Even the small characters like the side-splittingly hilarious Jesus Quintana, the police chief of Malibu or the black taxi driver you will laugh at time and time again. The amount of small but memorable characters is almost too much to count.The movie has some issues, though. Because of the narrative being so convoluted and not being the point anyway, the film feels at times like a series of isolated sketches than a consistent whole. It can also be very confusing for first time viewers who will try to follow the plot. To fully enjoy this movie one has to be in a certain mindset.Recommendation: Like all Coen brothers films, The Big Lebowski is not for everyone. But for those who enjoy this sort of comedy, finding a better film of this sort is hard.",The Big Lebowski
397,karedhawk,The Big Dissapoint,2,7 April 2019,"45 mins into the movie , and haven't even cracked a smile. What a stale movie, it's as though they are trying so desperately to be funny, and it's falling flat, real flat. Expected much more from the cast too. Disappointed",The Big Lebowski

The dialogue, cast and just about anything else you can imagine. The one thing I like most about this movie is the characters. I adore the fact that Jeff Bridges's character is so relaxed, calm, and cusses alot. I mean where else can you find a character who can say, ""Man, I hate the f***ing Eagles!"" like him? I really like how aggressive John Goodman's character is, and how he has a recurring obsession with the vietnam war. Overall, this movie is absolutely awesome! If you haven't seen it.

400,charliesonnyray,The Big Slap In The Face,5,22 December 2015,"I don't hate this film. I don't like it either. For me, it just kind of exists. It's understandable though why so many people enjoy this picture. There are quite a few chuckle worthy moments and the characters are quite funny in how quirky they are.The actors are rather charming and the Coen brothers are good directors. However, that doesn't make up for the fact that this movie adds up to nothing. Random events happen for no good reason, many of the characters are completely pointless and even the story is unnecessary as well. It starts off with this unique crime plot about ""The Dude""-a lazy bum-who gets mistaken for a millionaire with the same name as him. The Dude then gets caught up in this convulted scheme by German nihilists to blackmail the millionaire by holding his trophy wife hostage. But by the end of the flick I realized that absolutely nothing was at stake. I don't want to spoil it so I will just leave it at that. I don't mind if a story just wants to meander around aimlessly. Alice in Wonderland does that but at least there's a reason for it, they are in a dream like world that makes no sense. Here, they set up this world like its flesh and blood reality where things are run by rules and regulations but then some things will happen out of nowhere and lead to nothing-like the plot. You can't have a world run by both chaos and order. It just doesn't make any sense. That's The Big Lebowski. It feels like the whole movie is a big joke the Coen brothers are pulling on the audience. You are given a tour of strange characters that are tied together by a overly complicated plot that meant nothing in the end. I wouldn't recommend this unless watching a bunch of walking character quirks stumble around for an hour and a half sounds like fun to you. And if you do, don't worry you aren't alone.",The Big Lebowski
401,stephen_thanabalan_fans,"El DUDErino, Where's my Kahlua? or my rug, man...in the parlance of our times",6,6 March 2006,"I first stumbled onto this movie in 1999 and happened to catch it again recently, and it just still makes me want to grab a glass, pour that Kahlua and add milk and vodka to join Jeff Bridges for oat soda and a slacking good time of a convolutely escapist and trashy experience with the odd character 'heroes' of LA. But this film is not as great a film as it is rated as it lacks truly redemptive qualities of reconciliation, or say, tying together a greater purpose behind it, let alone a great plot like say its parallels with Raymond Chandler's 1939 novel, The Big Sleep, of which it does no justice to in being loosely related. However, in another sense, it's greater purpose can be looked at differently: that since its the ultimate slacker film, it has no need for a greater purpose in the first place. But, that's just like, my opinion, man. Let's say, just like the rug that 'held the room together', Bridges, the Dude, in an oddly engaging way, was the only thing that held the film together for me. And save also for an unbelievably spaced out and unconventionally witty and nihilistic (which is ironic considering the brilliant Coen brothers seemed to be mocking nihilists) script, not the plot, the film is one of the most anti-establishment in terms of relativism.Of course, there is a certain sad genius to it all, owing in some sense to the elements that lie in the film's references to double crossing and pseudo complications, of course, with updated time-lines (1991- Sad'm and I-raq) and anti-yuppie achievement ethos coupled with unconventional 'heroes', that is complete with the standard issue oddball fest of characters in Coen Bros parlance (they seem to be competing with Fellini for numbers of colorful characters). This film's best bits are in fact not the parallels with the Big Sleep but its unpredictably predictable plot directions which may be part underbelly psychological black comedy and part pseudo film noir laced with double entendres. The plot is not the main steal, rather its almost a straw man, as it is just a vehicle for the hilariously zany dialog between characters' to platform itself. Want to know just how insane the dialog was? Read the memorable quotes from the film on the Internet. There are even parallels in this film that might lead some to speak of a religion in 'Dudism' and its enlightenment of non-ideals, and I bet there are some crazed converts out there right now, lost in its futility. Nonetheless, because of these slacker ideals and the Dude's apathy or value system (relativism) toward life, and however I feel about the futility of it all, obviously, the 'Dude' character must have been classic enough to warrant such attention.In the story, The Dude obviously steals the plot, for without him there is no impetus, after all, the plot is that he is forced out of slack jawed Bohemia as a result of his rug getting micturated on by a pornographer's thugs whose boss wants cash owed by the young trophy wife of a rich tycoon who is his namesake. Hilarity ensues under series after series of incredulous circumstances when the Dude asks the Bigger Lebowski for compensation and in turn gets the Big L offering a 'cash' job for him. The dude loses the 'cash' only to find he the had been duped in a 'ringer for a ringer' when the paraquat tycoon wanted his porn acting wife dead and handed him an empty briefcase. The Dude assumed the wife kidnapped herself, and then later discovers that nihilists want a share of the money and are out to kill him. Big L's daughter gets acquainted with the Dude as she opposes the plan, and a PI trails the Dude looking for the wife, who in the end, had just gone away for the weekend, in a shock Hitchcock-esquire secondary macguffin on top of the basic macguffin of the 'rug'.Some unique film techniques are also used in this film, including blending soundtracks from previous scenes by way of songs being played on radios, or having dialog repeated, such as when the Dude constantly rehashes phrases he heard in the previous scenes (from Julianne Moore's character, Bush's speech, etc). One of the most quirky bits of the film can be described by a phrase from the Dude yet again- occasional 'acid flashbacks'- spaced out hallucination scenes where the cannabis smoking Dude flies through the bowling lane, or over LA. Making the bricolage plot even more colorful is the character of Walter, played brilliantly by John Goodman, who is a highlight of the film- representing a Vietnam scarred war veteran who associates events in the world with the horrors he has experienced. Yet, what is interesting about Walter is that it seemed he is modeled as a possible cross between the Jewish German Walter Kaufmann (the irony again) and an anarchistic gun crazy war machine- a rambunctious combination that results in lines like 'at least the Nazis had ethos' and so on. Coen fave Steve Buscemi's character adds the fragile dimension by asking the obvious questions and being constantly told to shut up in a reference to their previous hit, Fargo, before dying off unceremoniously. Likewise, many of the other characters are borderline offensive to the mainstream yet one can't help but crack up in wake of their absolutely crazy antics- the visual gag that saw the Dude trace pornographer Jackie Treehorn sketching a giant erection was an absolute nut-job and case in point. The stranger has a memorable cowboy cameo just for 'style' while Da Farino's scenes were a study in comedic nothingness. And that's what this film is- nothingness that served no purpose- I mean, as I said, it's the dude, man. El duderino for those who think brevity is...but most important now, don't forget to sip that white Russian while you slack off watching this.By Stephen Thanabalan",The Big Lebowski
402,prince_vlad,The big nothing,1,3 July 2018,"After seeing this movie i sat and think abit if I saw a movie or I starred at a garbage can which was stinking the more you stayed near it. The movie seems like one in whcih important roles are held by no name actors and the insignificant by the best one (Bridges, Moore, Buscemi, Goodman). What do you get ? Three losers, one more loser than the next one, are playing big boys, except the part where they were supposed to look like big boye. They look like embarrasment walkers and nothing more.

403,exterminator_99,The Dude: A Hero,9,22 May 2001,"The Coen Brothers have scaled dizzy heights in the 1990s.  ""Barton Fink"" and ""Millers Crossing"" showed an outstanding knack for serious comedy, if such a phrase can be used.  The unfortunate failure of ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" was followed by ""Fargo"", their most critical and commercially successful film to date.  When ""The Big Lebowski"" came out in 1998, it was met with some critical division and was not the commercial success many had envisioned it to be.  It is a shame, because ""The Big Lebowski"" is an outstanding comedy, filled with great characters and brilliant dialogue.  It is also technically superb, with meticulous attention paid to every detail.  Add in career-topping roles from Jeff Bridges and John Goodman and you have a movie that will be held in the same esteem as some of the greatest comedies ever.It's Los Angeles 1991.  Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Bridges) is mistaken for another Jeffery Lebowski: a millionaire paraplegic whose young trophy wife has been acumilating debts around Los Angeles.  The Dude, as he is known, has his home invaded by some thugs who have come to collect the debt.  When realising he is not the correct Lebowski they urinate on his rug.  Angry, The Dude seeks payment from the other Lebowski for a replacement rug.The Dude a sort of hippy who has only slightly modernised and grown up since the 60s.  All The Dude does is bowl, drive around and get stoned.  What is so great about The Dude is the ease at which Bridges plays the character. It is almost the perfect role for him.  With long, shoulder length hair, a goatee beard and pajama like attire, The Dude is slacker cool before it became a early to mid 90s chic.  The Dude's friends are similarly eccentric: the dim and permanently off the ball Donny (Steve Buscemi) and the aggressive Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), who is caught up in the past, especially his experiences in Vietnam.  Why The Dude hangs out with such different characters is unusual, but it only adds to the comic genius of the film.Other characters are superb as well.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Brandt, the anally-retentive assistant to the ""Big"" Lebowski, who is also brilliantly played by David Huddleston.  However, perhaps the most memorable character is Jesus Quintala, a bowling opponent of the three friends. Played by Coen Brothers stalwart John Turturro, Jesus is a hilariously disgusting Latino bowler, who wears skin-tight pink and blue jumpsuits to his bowling games.  This character almost outshines The Dude as the most fun character to watch.Further on in the story The Dude, Walter and Donny get caught up in a botched kidnapping plot, which is sometimes confusing and ultimately anti-climatic.  This film is more a series of hilarious vignettes rather than a cohesive story.  The film is packed with witty memorable quotes that hit the mark more often than you think.  The Coen Brothers construct outstanding set pieces: the dolly and slow motion tracking shots of the bowling hall, the Dude's dream sequence and the Citizen Kane-like drawing room of the ""Big"" Lebowski.  All of these combined with the fine performances make this an unforgettable comedy.",The Big Lebowski

Nothing better than a bum who bowls with his 2 loser friends, one who never listens and the other who is a Vietnam Vet who is ALWAYS reminding you of his experience. One stolen rug starts off the heist of millions. And The Dude is stuck in the middle of all of it. He's pulled in every direction while trying to figure out who kidnapped the wife of a millionaire who happens to have the same name, Jeff Lebowski.Thrown into this film are German Nialists (""We Believe in Nossing,Lebowski!!""), Eccentric naked painters, and a bowler accused of pedophilia.

Jeff Bridges played the perfect lowlife, bum, unemployed, laid-back, surfer-type, long-haired ""Dude."" I think one of the funniest parts of the movie was when the cop from Malibu was talking to the Dude in his office and then Jeff Bridges had to be reminded about authority with a coffee mug. I was on the ground laughing because I could see that happening to someone. You had to learn to respect authority or suffer the consequences. I learned that most of the things that we encountered in life just had to be laughed at or ignored like the ""Dude"" did in The Big Lebowski. Everything would turn out fine in the end.

The humor goes from clever to pure slapstick but always manages to be funny.The most fascinating thing about this movie is that it improves upon each look. After the first time I saw it, I thought that it was great, the next time, I thought it was even better. I've seen it six times now, and it  just keeps on improving.

The comedic timing and skillful screenplay are amazing. Watching these three interact in scenes is beautiful.

I just saw it altogether, and it's a must. Many of the actors have been seen in previous Coen brothers films (Goodman, Buscemi, Turturro, Polito, Stormare). They must have did something with their food, because they are stunning in this one. Especially Goodman, except for the fact that he's a using a four-letter word a lot.

414,from_christmas_past,Mark that as an eight.,8,3 July 2008,"It is a director's movie and again, the Coen brothers manage to leave their idiosyncratic stamp on this movie. Mostly intriguing, but sometimes weird, the Coens allow another story to unravel in a psuedorealistic world that they create in so many of their movies. Looking back at this movies as a whole, it seems like a rather mediocre product with crumbling storyline. However, if you have watched the Coens enough, you would know that they are more likely to deliver instantaneous gratification while watching a movie than give memorable product to be remembered later. So, while some subplots in the Big Lebowski stick out like a sore thumb, the movie succeeds in entertaining with some genuinely hilarious scenes. There are moments where sheer brilliance radiates from the scene construction and it is for these moments the movie has to be watched. In my early days as a Coens fan, I have made the mistake of trying to overthink their movies. It is mistake because retrospectively their movies may appear ordinary, but at the time of viewing, the Coens amazing audaciousness holds together. It may be viewed as a victory of style over substance, but it really is an effort to choose entertainment over reality. I did not take much home from Lebowski, neither did I think it was a perfect storyline, but it was thoroughly entertaining. And sometimes, that is all you need.",The Big Lebowski

The Coen's are cinematic genuiuses. When watching this film, realize that everything in it is done for a reason. With that in mind you might realize what a masterwork this film is.2. Long have I lamented the fact that every stoner comedy ever made has looked like it was made by stoners. So many movies involving potheads are idiotic and unrealistic. Finally, here is a movie that accurately portrays drug use, it's effects and does not underestimate the intelligence of the viewer. Call it the intelligent stoner comedy.3. Set in the early 90s, this movie was made in the mid 90s sparking the obvious question: why set a movie only a few years back? Because for the Coen's it is a launching pad for cinematic brilliance.4. The Maude character is great. I think she intimidates a lot of us men, but it really is nice to throw a deconstructionist-feminist in there.5. Philosophically speaking, this movie really touches some bases. Example: When the police officer calls the Dude a loser and the Dude replies ""well, that's like, just your opinion, man?"" Is morality simply an opinion? Does with authority come the right to pass judgement on others? To what extent? These and other questions are raised, although perhaps not solved in this fine work of art.10/10",The Big Lebowski

Lots of simpletons, good for nothings, fake German and Italian accents, making fun of nihilists, pacifists, artists without any point? Lots of curses, f.. This f... That.... Simplistic scenario. Lots of characters doing nothing. Bowling??? So what? I laughed at 2 or 3 scenes thar is all.
No wit in dialogues or jokes. Everything predictable. Brutish sexual, physical jokes.I have never been disappointed like this. Not offending the people that like or see something in this, I am just not one of them.",The Big Lebowski
417,kostkyrolga,A bit overrated,7,2 August 2021,"Despite its great reviews, in my opinion, this comedy is not a masterpiece.

418,jdberkley,The Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint!,10,4 May 2006,"There's almost no point in commenting on ""The Big Lebowski""-- there's no way of summing up exactly what makes this movie so tremendously entertaining to the people that get it, and there's no way of convincing the people that don't that they're just stark raving mad. Nonetheless, I feel compelled to say something here, as I've insisted on several occasions that friends and relations watch this film, and no one I've recommended it to has complained yet.I have a theory, which is probably complete hooey, about the genesis of this film. For years, the Coen brothers had made well-reviewed films that were usually overlooked by the Academy. Once ""Fargo"" broke through and earned them their deserved degree of industry acclaim, the Coens had a degree of freedom they'd never really had before. So, when they went to make a film to follow up what was considered a masterpiece, they chose the silliest subject matter they could come up with-- a noir comedy starring a unemployed stoner named Jeffrey Lebowski, a business tycoon of the same name, a porn king, a feminist conceptual artist, a wayward young wife, a buddy who can never get a word in edgewise, a gang of German nihilists, and a best friend named Walter Sobchak, who doesn't so much have flashbacks to the Vietnam War as he simply refuses to acknowledge that the war ever ended. Oh, and I left out the bowling pederast named Jesus.Never before, and never since, have the Coens made a film with this much sheer, unadulterated glee. As has been said many times in earlier comments, John Goodman's performance as Walter is an award-worthy amalgamation of loyalty, hyper-rationalism and homicidal rage. Jeff Bridges, as the unemployed Lebowski(he prefers ""the Dude""), has never been funnier(the scene where he tries and fails to throw a cigarette out of his car window is especially brilliant) as he aimlessly navigates the Dude's way through a kidnapping plot that is anything but routine. The Coens pepper the script with some of the sharpest dialogue they've ever come up with, and they're fearless in simply following their storytelling instincts wherever they lead. Any film that includes a musical sequence set to Kenny Rogers and the Second Edition and features both Julianne Moore in a Viking costume and Saddam Hussein as a bowling-alley attendant has more than its share of guts.Do my comments explain why this film has become the cult classic that it is? Of course not-- if I could write that well, I'd have written ""The Big Lebowksi"" myself. At one point, the film's narrator, a cowboy played by Sam Elliott(darn, left him out too) is trying to describe The Dude, and he says something like, ""The Dude was...man, I lost my train of thought."" It's ridiculous as narration, but it's also instructive-- this is an entire movie that quite often loses its train of thought. And it's all the richer for it.",The Big Lebowski
419,happiscotsman,Continuation of Imagination,8,24 July 2002,"This was the Coen Brothers first release after their award-winning ""Fargo"", and it continued their reputation as probably Hollywood's most imaginative pair of idea men. Critics of the Coens say their movies have no sensitivity, and that their ""imaginativeness"" is only a recycling of old themes. I say that I don't agree one hundred percent with their police work there. What they do is pay homage to classic memories of films while working them into the strange universe that has been titled ""Coen County"". ""The Big Lebowski"" continues with what has made them so entertaining. Bizarre characters, encounters, and dialogue occur during His Dudeness' journey in the City of Angels. Don't expect majestic truths to be revealed, heart-rending melodrama, or fireballs. Just loads of laughs for anyone who appreciates intelligent and abstract humor. My only question is: Who is The Stranger supposed to be? Is he The Dude's guardian angel, his long-lost father, or another member of the Seattle Seven?",The Big Lebowski

Funnily enough, when I first watched it, I didn't rate it as highly as the other Coen titles I'd seen. On the second or third viewing, it suddenly gelled (the beer probably helped) and now it is totally in my all-time top three greatest ever. Its all in the script of course, and the performances, and the art direction, and the surreal sequences, and the music... well, you get the idea. Every aspect of this movie is just perfect. It cannot be improved on in any way, and therein lies its genius. Central to its immortality are the two leads - Goodman and Bridges - who are note perfect in every single scene. Speaking of scenes, there are too many great ones to count, but the last time I watched, the funeral parlor became my newest favorite. ""It is our most modestly priced receptacle...""The greatest thing about this movie is that you just have to think of a line of dialog and it just cracks you up immediately.

421,Bobson10,That rug really tied the room together,9,20 April 2013,"Directed by Joel CoenStarring Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Julian MooreWritten by Ethan and Joel Coen'""Dude"" Lebowski, mistaken for a millionaire Lebowski, seeks restitution for his ruined rug and enlists his bowling buddies to help get it.'Before watching this film, I knew it had somewhat of a 'cult' following but I never really heard any real noise about it. As the movie ended, I knew I didn't waste my time!Joel and Ethan Coen are great creators in the world of film-making. I've watched 'No Country for Old Men' and what I took away from that film was 'silence is golden.' But this film is an entirely different animal. 'The Big Lebowski' reminds me of 'Dazed and Confused' and 'Reservoir Dogs' in the way that it's so easy to relate to the characters that the Coen brothers superbly created. The writing is the strongest aspect of this picture. They speak in such a 'down to earth' tone that it seems like you're listening to one of your best friends speaking to you and it really helps the flow of the story. It's easy to read the characters and the atmosphere is shoved in your face, but not necessarily forced. It's brilliant. I salute the writers!The acting in this picture can be summarized with one certain name'John Goodman.' He stole the show. Period. End of story. Whenever his character was on screen, my eyes and ears were glued to him and when his character wasn't on screen, I was passionately awaiting an entrance. John Goodman's character has patience when everybody else's blood is rushing and he believes he knows the whole story without even knowing a shred of truth. He never looks back and never thinks twice. He was a joy to watch and I would watch the film again just because of him. Moving on, I had my doubts about Jeff Bridges at the beginning of the film. I didn't think he could pull off the character I was brought in front of in the beginning but as the film went on, he grew on me. I was buying everything he was saying. Great words with such a modern tone made his character just as enjoyable as Goodman's.The music in this picture met with the story at such a point, I was hypnotized. It had a 'Farelly Brothers' edge to it. At times, I thought I was watching one of their films. The music had such a 'good mood' atmosphere and it leaves you so relaxed. It's the kind of music you would have playing if you were going on a long road trip with a few buddies.'The Great Lebowski' was fun. I can't say that about a lot of films I've seen in my life. It's a film that's worth a second viewing and if you haven't seen this film, I strongly recommend you give it a look.",The Big Lebowski
422,jacob-l-williams,A Perfect Comedy?,10,13 July 2010,"The Big Lebowski is one of my favourite films and it is the sort of film you can watch over and over again and each time it gets better and even funnier, nearly every element of this film is made for a joke in some way and it is these deep-rooted jokes that make the film. It is so well written that a majority of the jokes aren't even noticed first time you watch, but then watching again you pick up on them and next time there's more.I've seen the film about six times and I have to say I have laughed more each time I have watched it as I discover more and more jokes.It is honestly hard to think of a bad thing about this film, Jeff Bridges heads a fantastic cast with some simply brilliant acting; and all potential narrative loopholes are cleared up by the end.The Co-en Brothers are fantastic filmmakers and I am shocked that this film did not win more awards or get more acclaim at the time.9/10",The Big Lebowski

It has one of the greatest cult followings I've ever seen and the movie is chock full of one-liners.  The Cohen brothers are able to deliver yet again with a great piece of Americana twisted around a wonderful comedy.  The Dude (Jeff Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges) is your average unemployed stoner whose number one hobby is bowling.  His friends and teammates are Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), a Vietnam veteran, and Donny (Steve Buscemi), who is never allowed to get more than a few words in.The Dude becomes involved first with a vandalism at his apartment, then later tangled in a web of robbery, extortion, kidnapping and pornography.

424,Percivalx,The Big Dud,4,4 June 2007,"I just had the unfortunate experience of watching The Big Lebowski for the first time. All I can say is that I'm amazed at its popularity. It's hard to comprehend people actually like this overrated dud and claim it's funny and entertaining. As if the muddled and overloaded script and plot weren't enough, the characters aren't the least bit interesting to watch. Jeff Bridges' character is an unemployed loser, and for that reason alone, we're suppose to think he's ""really cool"". I bet slacker misfits must be the only ones who could identify with such character. Moreover, John Goodman's character is downright obnoxious. Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro are wasted in nonsensical roles. Plus, the laughs are few and far between. The cliff scene when John Goodman scatters Steve Buscemi's ashes but the wind blows them on to Jeff Bridges' face, is probably the funniest bit in the whole movie. Everything else seems forced. The music is forgettable and if you want a better display of Roger Deakins' cinematography, I suggest you see a better Coen brothers' film - O Brother, Where Art Thou? To think this film came from the same people who brought us Fargo and Blood Simple.",The Big Lebowski

I love John Goodman as an actor but his character here was more annoying than anything. I think Steve Buscemi's character should have been more developed and involved, and taken some screen time from Goodman. A little Goodman in this character would have been hilarious but not overly played out.",The Big Lebowski

Nevertheless, that's what happened during the Big Lebowski.I can't say that there was anything particularly horrible about it except that, like Fargo, the pace was a bit slow for me. It was an INTERESTING movie, but never elevated to the point of greatness.The day after my first attempt at watching it, I rewound the movie to where I left off and was much more disappointed with the ending than I probably would have been if I were half asleep.I think this film is a sarcastic play on the Common Man as a hero and, in that respect, it was a little bit refreshing and somewhat similar to Kingpin. But if you want to see a great movie with the Common Man as a hero, just rent The Hero with Dustin Hoffman. (Five stars/ten)",The Big Lebowski
427,WeslyM,A celebration of coolness,9,3 May 1999,"The Coen Brothers strike again, and provide yet another glimpse into the skewed world inhabited by their imaginations.  This perfect and unexpected follow-up to their popular and critical success ""Fargo"" is an absurdly loony movie that defies simple categorization. Is it a comedy, a thriller, a mystery, a neo-noir?  The truth is that, somehow, it's all of that--and a bag of chips.  More or less, it's about bowling, mistaken identity, and a soiled rug.  Jeff Bridges is so mellow, so cool as The Dude, and Julianne Moore, everybody's favorite indie darling (let's just forget ""The Lost World""), is perfect as the mind-bogglingly bizarre Maude.  Look for appearances by all the usual suspects (John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro) as well as a few new friends.  ""The Big Lebowski"" celebrates coolness, hallucination, and nihilism, and it elevates bowling beyond the status of New Religion directly to The One True Faith.",The Big Lebowski
428,Murph-24,The best bowling comedy of 1998,10,3 August 1999,"At a Conservative Party ccktail function sometime last year, after a few drinks the subject naturally got onto best films. The general concensus was that ""Withnail & I"" had that title of funniest, and of that there was little genuine argument. However, there was a small contingent of persons present who claimed that the Coen brothers with Lebowski, a then, recent offering, could possibly wrest the title from Robinson's hitherto safe hands. Though I should add that they voiced this opinion in a humble and respectful manner.An investigation ensued, and within a week I had located an establishment that was to play it, and set to my task, viz. a comparison with studious meticulousisity. To take the film as it stands would be the only way to treat it fairly because, to be fair to it, it is completely different to Withnail. It is a totally different kind of humour, and style of filming. Whereas Withnail features a kind of low budget dark, earthy and realistic humour, Lebowski has a certain elaborate feel to it, from the expensive sets and abstract scenes to the wealth of locations and Hollywood feel. But enough of the comparisons, I'm supposed to be writing about Lebowski here, so no more Withnail. But let it be said, they are both titled on names and concentrate on bums (or a bum).Lebowski tends to rely on seemingly obvious jokes and repeated lines and styles,(such as ""shut the F***K UP Donny"", ""I'll suck your c**k for a thousand dollars"" and ""Am I wrong?"") combined with a rewarding subtle blend of character-based humour, (such as Lebowski never finishing his lines, Donny never getting to say anything, Brandt's nervous mannerisms, and numerous self referential statements). Some people from the Dumb and Dumber school of comedy appreciation will ""get"" very little of Lebowski, and will not rate it. These are largely the same kind of people who thought that Mallrats was better than Clerks. The introduction to the film and, most importantly, to Lebowski is utterly perfect. The look at this supposed bum, and then at the till girl to put things in perspective, creates good empathy with the inner workings of the protagonist. He took his  choice, others take theirs. Great camera work and combination with Dylan provides the perfect setting to the bowling hall, and hence, the backdrop to the film. This style of filming is the Coen brothers at their very best, and blending of the title sequence into the story is done as well as anyone could do.This film is made of a combination of straightforward camera shots and dialogue with very little action (aside from bowling or driving). This is then juxtaposed with some very abstract scenes such as dream sequences and slow motion footage of (questionably) real situations. This technique often creates a very effective result though sometimes can become tiresome. The main crux of the film is set in the real world and revolves around The Dude attempting to repatriate his living room with a rug. This is largely done in a very ordinary fashion but with a great wealth of humorous conversation. Goodman provides many memorable sayings. Where the film goes at a tangent to this, but with immediate purpose in mind, it works very well. The best examples of this are the introductory bowling scene (as stated), and the introduction of the loveable Jesus. When these scenes are not so welcome is when they actively distract from the flow of the story and serve only to break it up in an undesirable manner. Still, without this experimentation we would have been without some of the film's most impressive moments.As The Dude's main opponent is The Big Lebowski, a disabled veteran with a personal achievement complex. He is acted out brilliantly by Huddleston, has an excellent vocabulary ( including micturate) and is a very aggressive character, especially towards The Dude. Looking after him is his faithful servant Brandt who has some delightful nervous mannerisms and peculiar gaits which work well with his characters speaking parts. The blend of humour is mostly based around slight subtlety on the part of some characters, and outright over-the-top acting on the part of others. Add this to some great visuals, though not over the top, and the result is a finely crafted humorous product. In all, though not as good as the all conquering Withnail, Lebowski does manage to better Fargo, and is certainly one of the funniest films in recent years.",The Big Lebowski

430,mjg32,A great piece of cult movie making,9,8 April 2007,"If you see any ""greatest film lists"" or if your looking for top award winners, you will never find The Big Lebowski. Film critics will not praise it, as it doesn't really have any underlying message on life, love or the dangers of drugs or whatever. They would feel ashamed to admit that this is one of the best films ever. Fortunately, thanks to the regular film viewers on IMDb, The Big Lebowski gets the praise it so rightfully deserves, and a cemented place in the top #250.It offers so many things. It has the usual brilliant Coen Bros script, with its twisting plot and humour. It has so many unusual and wonderful characters. It really is one of the funniest films ever. They could have easily taken the script and made it into a good thriller. But the Coens made it into so much more.The characters are just brilliant. Jeff Bridges is great as ""The Dude"", who never fails to have a drink in his hand, and ends each sentence with ""man"". John Goodman puts in a terrific performance, as a Vietnam veteran who turns into a raving lunatic at the drop of a hat, but ""doesn't roll on Shabbah"". My favourite performance comes from Steve Buscemi, despite only having a relatively small part. He maintains a rather puzzled expression throughout, only to interrupt conversations at random intervals. The Coens could have easily left Donnie out of the film, but it's little additions like him that make this film great.There's so many great quotes and scenes in the film, and showing the dreams in the weird mind of The Dude such as the scene with the flying carpet, just adds a bizarre yet wonderful quality that most comedies don't have.At the end of the film, after viewing all the wacky characters, danger and plot twists, The Dude brings to your attention that all he wanted was his rug! This just adds to the comic approach the Coens went for, and The Big Lebowski leaves you feeling happy and warm inside, as you have just witnessed such greatness on screen.When I look at the fact that The Big Lebowski won just 1 (minor) award, it just proves that there is no justice in the world of film, and I find it hard to swallow that such genius can go unrewarded.By my reckoning this is one of the Coen brothers finest achievements to date, up there with Fargo and Miller's Crossing, and believe me, that is some achievement. Their unique and clever scripts show they have so much more imagination than most screen writers, and despite the fact they haven't made a really great film for a few years, I hope they are just laying dormant and will give us another wonderful film such as The Big Lebowski.",The Big Lebowski

It was perfectly written, amazingly acted, wonderfully directed, there wasn't a single thing wrong with the film. If you ever talk to a person who did not enjoy this film, it's because it was too far above them. There are plenty of jokes for everyone. And then there are the perfectly added ""inside jokes"" as well. Such as the several references to ""Branded"" an old TV show. A show the characters in the film loved. They talked of it lasting hundreds of episodes, when in fact, there were only a handful of episodes. There were jokes about every day life. Jokes about the simple fact that the Dude is a dinosaur. Every other ""radical"" or ""hippie"" grew up, got jobs, and stopped with the drugs. The Dude on the other hand, is still living in the 60s. And if you look at his friends they all have their own little stories, and show how deeply their pasts affect them. However, they show this great characterization through jokes. Something very hard to do. For example Walter(Goodman)obviously hit his peak and the height of his life, back in Vietnam and when he was married. So, the jokes about him are Walter spazzing at people ""I AM A UNITED STATES VETERAN!"" And that's how we get to know him. How unique is that? The same thing can be said of Donnie(Buscemi) here is an ex-surfer who obviously did drugs, and they took his mind, you know this from his sheer absent mindedness. It's truly a unique film, of which we shall never see the like again, and for that I'm sorry. It's the Coen brothers at top form.",The Big Lebowski
435,eraceheadd,Pure Genius!,10,21 May 2000,"The Big Lebowski has to be for of the single funniest films I have ever seen.  I love the Coen brothers and think their sense of comedy and character is one of best in Hollywood.  As in most of their films, they deal with a lot of seemingly simplistic story lines that seen erratic and confusing at first, but you have to dig into their movies, see then a few time, and watch the magic of the story unfold.  The characters in this film are all incredibly done.  They are so well written you can taken any of them right out of the movie and they would still be more interesting alone then the entire cast of characters in most Hollywood movies.  The cast is flawless  the dialogue hilarious (like I said, you have to see this movie more than once, the humor is fast and the dialogue often overlaps, so its hard to catch every thing the first time) and the direction is awesome.  Not many films can boast that them have covered all the bases so completely.  Oh course, the Coen brothers have unusual ways of telling a story  here they have kind of turned it into an Old West Legend, as the narrator tells us of the man named `The Dude'.  Of all the awesome characters in the movie  not taking anything away from Jeff Bridges - I have to just love John Goodman the most.  He is just so under rated  and so incredible funny, I can't believe that he is not used more in Hollywood as a total manic. He is the best!   If you see this movie, sit back and watch every scene unfold, and you will find a bit of humor in every single scene of the movie.  And  what you are left with is a testament to the early 90's; commentary on the human condition,  war, politics, social standards, and some truly hilarious moments all through out.

There's not one character that feels miscast or ""out of place"", not even the German nihilists. And then there is Jesus... When you think it can't get any weirder (unless you go see ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") wait until Jesus starts to bowl.

No questions asked.
One cannot help but wonder though how the dude makes a living besides playing courier for ransom money? Maybe he acts as a jury for his landlord's dancing performances? Who knows?

Thought I'd give it another chance. The first half was actually okay - I really enjoyed these power actors portraying middle america nobodies, even if things were a little slow moving. Then out of a sudden at the halfway mark the plot smacks into a wall and scatters and the actors don't seem to have noticed.Once we ""know"" where the money is, all the tension disappears and we have no idea why Bridges and Goodman are still wandering around LA instead of getting the money back. Bridges and Goodman didn't do anything illegal, why can't they get the police involved at this point? Why go tell a murderous thug that his money is at a high school kid's house? Why did the murderous thug let Bridges off so easy, after previously sending him a toe? There are no stakes for the rest of the movie.The bowling plot was okay, but talk about anti-climactic. I've never seen a movie build up a tournament and then not show the tournament. It could've been a bold move, except for one detail: the film killed off one of his bowling teammates and nobody even comments on a replacement. How are Bridges and Goodman even going to participate in this tournament without a third? And we know they have no friends to ask.",The Big Lebowski
444,dmbjam29,The Coen Brothers Best!,8,29 January 2007,"This movie is the Coen Brothers best film!It is their funniest, most original and most engaging film of their illustrious careers. The movie is about The Dude (Jeff Bridges) a dead-beat hippie-bowler who becomes entangled in the affairs of well-to-do Hollywood figures Mr. Lebowski (David Huddleston) and Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara).The strength of the movie is the uproarious relationship and dialog between The Dude, Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buschemi), all partners on a bowling team. Their lines might be some of the most memorable and quotable in recent comedic history.Along with the three main characters, the Coen brothers have a bizarre mixture of characters (nihilist Germans, porn star thugs, uptight artists, bowlers, Spanish bowlers, peace-loving cab drivers, and interpretive dancing landlords.) The ingredients appears to be outrageous, but the Coen brothers make it work!This is a comedy that makes you laugh hours/days/weeks after watching it. It has a tremendous cast, did I mention Julianne Moore and Philip Seymour Hofman are also in it. It's one of those movie where outrageous characters, situations and ideas are thrown together and it makes one of the most hilarious movies ever made, it is certainly the Coen brothers best! Highly recommended!8 out of 10!",The Big Lebowski

There is so much buildup that I expected something really grand as a climax.  There isn't really a climax..unless you count The Dude knocking Maude up.

First off, it has one of the single best scripts I have ever seen. It is funny, weird and incredibly quotable. The characters are well drawn and so odd that you can't help but love them. The Coen brothers have made some very good movies but nothing compares to the utter genius displayed here.The Big Lebowski exists on the plain of earth that we just don't inhabit.

It's hard to be objective when your first viewing of a cult movie comes 20 years after it was released. You are certain to have heard a lot about it from many people over the years and most of it was probably favorable. If it's a comedy you might expect it to be hilarious or at least funny in a quirky way. All movies age, but none age worse than comedies. Everything from set pieces to asides are creatures of their moments and usually don't remain funny 2 decades later. I've found that an exception to this rule is silent film comedies. Buster Keaton and Laurel and Hardy silent movies are, to me, as funny now as they were then.Back to TGL. Yes, I've heard a lot about it over 20 years, most highly favorable. I did not avoid it, I just never crossed paths with it, not until this week.As a funny movie, I can put it no higher than a 5. I never laughed out loud, but there were some moments when I was edging in that direction.""Silly"" and ""stupid"" are the 2 words I would use to describe TGL.Casting: Silly and stupid usually describe Jim Carrey and I can certainly see him in this fiasco. But wait! Were they acting or merely mugging for the camera? Those 2 and Sam Elliott and Steve Buscemi did nothing more than play caricatures of their on screen personas. John Turtorro is one of our best actors but not here. Ben Gazzara's cameo was the best part of the movie, but he had little competition.Plot: Reminded me of a Bob Hope ""road"" movie. All over the place and not coherent.Style: The Busby Berkeley scenes reminded me of Blazing Saddles.Silly and stupid should not be confused with funny.",The Big Lebowski

This is one of his best performances I have ever seen. The supporting cast is great with John Goodman (no Oscar nod?), Steve Buscemi, John Turturro (always great), Sam Elliot, Pete Stromare, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, and David Huddleston.

This film is especially funny to me because I remember characters like ""The Dude"" and Walter Sobczak drinking and bowling all the time. A lot of wing nuts hang at the lanes, which to me, made the story even more plausible. LOL. I remember the late 80's & early 90's and they captured the ambiance of the bowling alley crowd perfectly. I adore this movie.The movie is hilarious but this is something you already know. I have a soft spot in my heart for the scene after Donnie has the heart attack and the next scene is a really cool pan of the lanes and the bowlers as Townes Van Zandt pines the Rolling Stones' ""Dead Flowers"" live as a backdrop; a really great combination of great Coen brothers and great music. Sadly, Townes Van Zandt died a year before this came out, which makes me wonder if they put that song in there as a tribute to him, and also fitting with Donnie's death; both are sad moments.And remember: ""That's right, nobody f*cks with the Jesus!""",The Big Lebowski

The plot to this movie isn't even that important: the way the characters react and the tone of the thing, that's what draws you into this piece. It is blissfully bizarre and probably belongs up there with Altman's The Long Goodbye and Polanski's Chinatown as a wonderful snapshot of Los Angeles wrapped in a private-eye story. Again, it isn't a riddle to be solved, just movie entertainment at its best. The initial ""mystery"" of this story is about as important to the final film as the initial ""who stole the truck"" business in the beginning of The Usual Suspects. Forget about it and listen to the Dude sponging-up vocabulary, Walter chastizing pascifism, and poor Donny always six steps behind, out of his element. Like all the Coen Brother's films, this one gets better with repeat viewings to catch every nuance in performance, dialogue, cinematography, etc.  Jeff Bridges gives his best performance since Fearless.

It's about this guy, ""The Dude"", excellently played by Jeff Bridges, who gets an unexpected visit from two thugs who soil his carpet.

Going really broadly on themes of art, religion and overall point of existence. Overarching theme of trying to survive, just live life without hurting others, enjoying what you have and counter points to that.

It's not about the plot, it's about the characters & the plot exists mainly to set up all kinds of different situations for them to handle (or mishandle most of the time). You won't get it if swearing annoys you. I hardly noticed the amount of bad language but it seems to annoy some people a lot. Most of all, if you don't empathise with the Dude, you won't get it.This is a very subtle movie that features many un-subtle characters who border on caricature much of the time. I think a lot of people expect an outright comedy & are disappointed by the lack of obvious jokes. It's a movie best approached with no expectation & it gets better every time I see it.

Racy dialog for 1998 I guess. It's now 2007 and it felt weak. Sorry your stepmom is a nymphomaniac, etc. just wasn't that funny or clever. More like cute. Believable characters, but I really didn't care. Everyone was just so stupid. There were a few funny lines, but the majority of the ""jokes"" were more about overwhelming ignorance than humor. I chuckled a few times. After an hour of the ignorance, it was predictable; the chair falling forward was no surprise. Stupid low brow physical comedy mixed with sort of high brow comedy. Like laughing at someone for using their salad fork during the entree. No deep belly laughs. ""It really tied the room together"" was funny the first time he said it. Decent twist but after viewing it a 2nd time (since a few reviewers said they hated it the first time then loved it later), I still don't know what proof The Dude had of the husband's motivations.

Two thugs break into his apartment and beat him up to get his money. They soon realize they got the wrong Jeffrey Lebowski. His Dudeness then decides to meet this millionaire Lebowski to get compensation for his damaged rug that was peed on during the incident. After the Big Lebowski's trophy wife is kidnapped, The Dude is in charge of delivering the ransom to get her back. The Big Lebowski marks a high point in The Coen brothers' career. They created an icon of the 90s with The Dude. He became a god-like figure for many. A guy adored by a generation thanks to his unique philosophy and style. I don't think The Dude could have been interpreted by a better actor than Jeff Bridges. He rocks the laidback attitude with a disconcerting comfort. Not to mention that his hair is so sleek, I'm hypnotized by it. The Bridges/Goodman/Buscemi trio is hilarious and the additional characters portrayed by talented actors like Julianne Moore, or Philip Seymour Hoffman are the cherries on top of this psychedelic cake. The Big Lebowski is one quotable masterpiece punctuated with bizarre dreamy scenes specific to the Coen bros. I don't know what they are on when they write their screenplays but I sure want some. I really like the soundtrack that features Bob Dylan among others. The plot suddenly becomes secondary and my main pleasure is to watch Jeff Bridges evolve in The Dude's colorful pants side by side with the wrathful veteran mastered by John Goodman. The characters and situations crack me up because they're all so incredible. The story is narrated by a cowboy, the villains are German nihilists, and John Turturro, who appears only for a few seconds on screen, is a bowler/sex-offender named Jesus. If that isn't random brilliance, I don't know what is.1 reason to watch: indulge in enjoying TBL dude-style with a guilt-free White Russian (or 9)",The Big Lebowski

There is a wider mystery and subplots lingering around the movie throughout but that's the small part of this big universe. We can all create our own backstories about Jesus, Donny , Walter, Mr Lebowski, Maude, and Philip Seymour Hoffman riotusly funny sort of butler. The thing is we can piece the puzzle ourselves but should we do that? Why mess up the fun just seat back and enjoy the film right this is the most slice of lifest of slice of life films I have ever seen. And this is the best stoner comedy film ever. Roger deakins cinematography really brings the relaxed attitude of the film. And Steve buscemi and John Goodman's acting is first rate. Goodman's Vietnam veteran character is superbly funny is jives at the then government of America and it's politics are very funny to hear but equally tragic and true. Steve buscemi is playing a dufous character who doesn't know anything what is going on is also very funny his role is somewhat of a plot point but still he carries the role in an masterfull way. Especially his demise was sad even you know he is not the central figure of the film but still you care, that's great acting. And dude the eponymous dude, the dudeness of all dudeness Jeff brigdes shines like a pot he is smoking and flying around the sky, this is the most phenomenal eventfull performance I have ever seen cause this character is still stuck in the upper echelons of pop culture and all thanks to Jeff brigdes.

465,LuckyGraveyardBoots,THE best comedy I've seen in my life,10,9 May 2006,"AWESOME. Seriously, this was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I have no idea what it's about, but I liked it. I kind of detected a 'circle of life' thing...in the world of L.A. slackers, everything works out, man, don't worry. Donnie dies, little Lebowski is born. Thus it continues. But you don't watch this for the message. It's got an excuse for a plot, at least: Big Lebowski's wife owes money to crooks and is kidnapped. 'The Dude' Lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire by the same name and his carpet is pi$$ed upon in a misunderstanding. Seeking compensation for the rug (which really tied the room together) he ends up commissioned to deal with the crooks. Introduce a trio of Nihilists (with marmot), a half-crazed feminist painter (Julianne Moore), a porno film industry and a gay pedophile who's extremely competitive about bowling (John Turturro) and you've got it...the ultimate stoned slacker comedy. Jeff Bridges is far out as The Dude, and hilariously understated, while John Goodman is his psychotically violent 'Nam vet best friend, who carries a piece to a bowling alley, and John Turturro is forever etched into my memory as Jesus Quintana (spoken to Walter: ""You got a date for Wednesday, baby! Whoo!"" Walter: ""...He's cracking."") Steve Buscemi was adorably pathetic as Donnie, the third wheel. One of the best quotes: Donnie: Are these the Nazis, Walter? Walter: No, Donnie, these men are Nihilists. There's nothing to be afraid of. It was very memorable, with excellent characters which is basically all that made it worth watching...the Coen's signature style doesn't come through here like it does in Fargo, and it's not overly artistic (well...in parts maybe) but it's so funny!

Dumb is Jeff Bridges as Lebowski, a middle-aged boozing and dope-smoking burnout, and dumber is John Goodman, an emotionally disturbed Vietnam vet. Throughout I was uncomfortable with not only the premise of the movie, which is that stupid and pathetic people are inherently funny, but with the portrayal of those characters, which was either accurate to the point of being unpleasant (Lebowski), or annoyingly unconvincing (Walter the vet).Realism has worked for the Coen bros in the past because they've made it amusing or startling. Here realism is stupid people with limited vocabularies saying f**k every other word. Someone ought to count the number of times the word is used, it's got to be a record. I have nothing against the word, it has it's place and can be a regular bon mot. But no word can be used that much and retain its meaning -- it just becomes a sound, an annoying sound, like a barking dog. The script must be fairly ugly to see, with that same all over it like a printer glitch or something.Then, surrounding the two dipsticks, you have an assortment of poorly conceived oddballs who are supposed to provide both the color and the framework of the plot, such as it is. That this is their purpose is so transparent the purpose is defeated, and we seek in vain to be amused by them for some -- any -- reason. Their sheer number is meant to make up for their shallowness I think. We have a pedophile, a lesbian, an expensive whore, a couple of moron tough guys, some German nihilists, a porno King, a cripple, a geek (who Goodman shouts at to shut up every time he speaks -- oh, that's rich), a ""fascist"" cop, a creepy gay weirdo, a smirking kissass etc. What fertile ground for comedy, yet nothing grows there. At one point, after being drugged (which in Lebowski's case was redundant) and then hit in the head with a coffee cup, Lebowski tells a cab driver to change the music because he doesn't like the Eagles, and the guy throws him out of the cab. Oh, chuckle chuckle, thrown out of a cab hah-hah. It's all about as amusing as having a tooth drilled. Even the musical interludes with spacy dream graphics are tedious.In summary: no good music, bad acting, boring plot and vapid script. To see this tripe in the top 250 along with movies like the original Planet of the Apes, or From Here to Eternity -- that's a mistake, all I can say. It must be all on Coen bros brand name alone.

""The Dude"", though, has the same name as a multi-millionaire called Jeffrey ""The Big"" Lebowski (hence the title), and when the multimillionaire owes money to a group of Nihlists (they don't believe in ANYTHING!), they mix up the two people's identities, and The Dude's carpet gets ruined because of it. The Dude then seeks restitution for his carpet, but soon becomes involved in a kidnapping involving ""The Big"" Jeffrey Lebowski's wife.

What ensues is complete mayhem.There were parts in this movie that I found to be so funny that I had to pause the movie while I laughed for minutes at a time. I also missed some parts because I was laughing so hard and had to rewind! The script is brilliant. Everything in this movie is absolutely hilarious, and the pace is fast! All of the characters are unique and have their own voice, like the burned-out ""Dude"", the short-tempered Walter and the extreme-feminist Maude, and there is not one scene without its fair share of guffaws. All of the acting is superb as well and the soundtrack is amazing! This is the funniest movie I have ever seen, it is extremely creative, always interesting, and just plain insane!

We go around from one weird character to another and of course, those dream sequences, I had the WTF look on them.I also love the scenery, as someone who has lived in LA, this quite how it is, with some ""fantasy"" touch, it reminded me of other movies with more realistic approach to LA like Drive and Nightcrawler against your La La Land for example.If it's a real masterpiece or not is still something I need to analyze it for a few more time, but I can finally see what drives people nuts for this movie.",The Big Lebowski
475,leviot,It's not about the destination; it's about the journey,10,6 April 2006,"Do not watch this movie expecting a nice clean storyline from top to bottom. In fact, you shouldn't expect anything clean out of this movie, including The Dude's rug. Not to say there is no plot to 'The Big Lebowski', there is, it's just completely inconsequential. This is a flick you want to watch when you don't have much else to do, you're feeling kinda relaxed, and you have a beer (or a white Russian) in your hands. The Dude will fascinate you, him and all his quirky friends.If you watched it once, watch it again. The dialogue and the lines are so uniquely funny. You will find new subtleties every time you watch it. If anyone gives you trouble just say 'Hey, easy, there's a beverage here!'",The Big Lebowski

I am still wondering what made people liking this movie so much? Plot was totally stupid and very much ordinary without any extraordinary element or one-liners, funny scenes, acting, or even photography. This was way too boring and pointless movie to me and it got 8.2 rating? :) Are you kidding me? I think even 3 stars are higher for this boring, jarring, pointless, stupid, silly, worthless, waste-of-time, mind-sucking movie. From the first scene to last scene, I have watched it and thought now there would be something now there would be something but no, at the end, credits started rolling and I simply threw the movie out of my collection.

It is laced with so many swear words, yet this doesn't give the dialogue any additional kick.  I have nothing against swearing in movies as long as it accomplishes something. The fact that nihilists feature prominently in this movie makes sense since the whole movie is pretty meaningless.  No real plot, random and incoherent dialogue, just a loser of a main character (Jeff Bridges), and I really didn't care if he lived or died.Obviously the ""genius"" of the movie eludes me.

The Coen Brothers' films have always, shall we say, been quirky. This hasn't got in the way of good acting, a great script, an interesting plot, a relevant musical score, or excellent cinematography.However in this film, the quirkiness got in the way of everything else. The plot is awful; the script is dire, with the dreaded 'f' work appearing at least once every five seconds (I'm not anti-swearing, but I do get intensely bored of hearing the same dialogue over and over again), the acting is uninspired - Buscemi is totally wasted, Bridges is irritatingly whining (though Tuturro is great, in a small part), the score is unmemorable and the camerawork is dull, except for the dream sequences, which seem forced, irrelevant and pretentious.I couldn't wait for this movie to end.

485,smprescott-1,A Few Random Observations,10,24 April 2011,"On watchability: I have a tendency, aided and abetted by Netflix, to find a really great movie and then watch it over and over. Before 'The Big Labowski', it was 'Mr. Hulot's Holiday' and before that 'The Seven Samurai'. In this regard, TBL holds a special place since it seems to be made especially for this kind of movie watching. It has a consistent a texture that feels soothing. The comfortable chair and TBL have a way of merging.On Walt: All of the Dude's problems are caused by his buddy Walt. Walt was the one who put the burr under his saddle about the rug. Without Walt, the rug incident would have been quickly lost in the haze that is the Dude's life. At every turn, it is Walt who drags the reluctant Dude further into the mess. My son summed up the Dude perfectly when he said that all he wanted throughout the film was to be left alone. But Walt is motivated and he won't leave the Dude alone. Walt's constant prodding is the McGuffin of TBL.Yes, Walt is a jinx but a lovable jinx. In fact, I would argue that John Goodman comes close to stealing the movie from Jeff Bridges. Someone has remarked that Goodman's genius comes from the fact that his personality is so much smaller than his enormous body -- he dominates the screen with his body but comes across as a cute puppy dog.On Style: Like other Coen Brothers movies and like so many British comedies from the golden era of the '50s and '60's, TBL cleverly hides many of its funny parts for us to discover. For example: Why does the Dude run instead of walk back to his home after buying the half-and-half? Answer: To connect with the white Russian as soon as possible.On Society: Now, a challenging question. Before a certain point in time somewhere in the '60s or '70s, TBL would never have seen the light of day because of its use of bad language (it repeats 'the anglo saxon word' 281 times). And without the bad language TBL would not be TBL. The question is this: Were we better off in the days of movie censorship and Humphrey Bogart or is the degradation of our language and every-day life adequately compensated by movie gems like this one? To put it another way, has being entertained become our reason for being?",The Big Lebowski
486,tyvo79,It's everything!,10,1 January 2021,"It's a film noir, it's a buddy flick, it's a stoner comedy, it's an art house film, it's a mystery, it's just, like, your opinion, man!Iconic.Jeff Bridges gives his most memorable performance, John Goodman gives his best performance. Supporting roles are expertly cast by the casting director, EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IS PORTRAYED BY THE ACTOR THEY WERE MEANT TO BE PORTRAYED BY.Every choice made by the Coen brothers is made with the utmost consideration. The details of the era are spot on, the plot and script are top-notch (vulgar, yes but that's the world they are writing in and for so if you don't like profanity then go watch something else without the profanity and leave the real art to those of us who appreciate it).

I would urge the masses of people here who seemed to ""get bored before it was half over"" to watch it again. Watch it again, and finish it this time. Remember a few things: 1) Funny movies are not always written for 12 year olds 2) Some of them don't have any of the Wayans brothers, or Adam Sandler in them!I'm not trying to be harsh on these actors - I'm trying to point out that this movie is more than slapstick. It's NOT hysterically funny that the Dude carries a drink with him, and sometimes spills it. It's not hilarious to have someone pee on the Dude's rug. It's not funny when Walter explains how easy it is to obtain a toe, WITH green nail polish on it (ok, that was pretty funny).What IS funny is how all of this fits together. The world's biggest stoner solving a fairly complex mystery. The interaction of 3 long-time friends, who don't really get along all the time. The crazy plot twists that we can barely follow, much less having the Dude follow them after endless joints and white Russians. As the Coens said in the extended DVD - This is a buddy movie above all. The story of 3 friends of differing qualities, with VERY different outlooks on life. Watch this movie again if you didn't get it the first time. Then again if you STILL don't get it. And if you still don't get it after 3 watches - try the Farrelly Brothers -- the Coen Brothers probably aren't your style! 10/10, without question.",The Big Lebowski

The cast is pure perfection. Some of regular Coen movies actors are on board as always. Plus of course the mighty Jeff Bridges, with the great portrait of DUDISM he offers us, and his phenomenal supporting actor, John Goodman, who doesn't wait for his time to shine to pull out the big guns.
Speaking of plot, it might not be a kind of conventional comedy as we already know, and the beyond belief executions that it offers us through the movie will persuade you about my opinion.

The Coen brothers are incapable of making a boring film, and this was no exception. Whether it's a great film (Fargo, Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men, Miller's Crossing, to name a few) or merely a puzzling one (Barton Fink comes to mind), their films are inventive, interesting, and memorable. Lebowski is closer to Barton Fink than the great films. There were many wonderful scenes, lines, and performances. However, to me, the overall effect was less than the sum of the parts. Even putting aside the numerous plot holes (because this film was clearly not about its plot), I found myself waiting for some narrative thread or theme to tie together the nearly random eccentric scenes. I left feeling the movie was strange, interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying. It wasn't a waste of my time, mind you, but no way should it be ranked as high as it is.",The Big Lebowski

It wasn't his fault someone urinated on his rug, but thats only the beginning of this laugh out loud comedy from the people who brought you FARGO.The Coen Brothers got so much critical acclaim for their previous film, that they decided to mix it up here. And they did, some critics loved it, some hated it, after seeing Fargo I have to admit it wasn't what I expected. But they roll enough solid laughs and camera tricks to satisfy even the most vengeful critic (get over it, they wanted to do a comedy, and they did it better then most).Scoring a perfect 300 is THE DUDE. He is the guy you wish you could be if you had the guts to throw all responsibility behind you and enjoy life not caring what people think of you or what you do. The Dude never was shown rolling a bowling ball during the movie despite most of it taking place during a bowling match involving him.And also scoring a perfect 300 (may-be he won't shoot me) is Walter played by John Goodman. Never better or louder, Goodman plays a Volcanic Vietnam Vet, who shouts paranoid logic and profanity.Steve Buscemi may have had a good score but every time he tried to talk Walter told him to shut the ____ up, So I give him a 250.

495,teelbee,"funny, but not altogether satisfying",6,4 June 2004,"I enjoyed many parts of the movie - quite a lot, in fact.  Jeff Bridges as the laid back ""luzer"" dude was brilliant. John Goodman, a 'Nam Vet', more than did his character justice. Some of the situations were really funny and made sense.  Some made no sense and were funny.  Other situations just made no sense. As a whole piece, it's a really flawed movie. Most of the situations revolved around the whereabouts of $1 million in ransom money. The ingenious plot twists usually hang together, but not always. What was the point of the volkswagon dectective? What did that contribute? Nothing - it was just another point of confusion. The nihilist gang (which at least provided some funny dialogs) never fit with the rest of the movie, which was irritating. The cowboy narrator never fit, either; although I found his folksy drawl to be comforting.This movie does a seriously poor job with it's female characters. The male lead characters are well developed, and most of the male secondary characters are well drawn also.  The women characters are all flat and bizarre - more like creatures from outer space than real people.  The millionaire's ""trophey wife"", Bunny, is a dumb blond ho. The adult daughter Maude comes off as mechanical and inhuman.So, we have flashes of brilliance interspersed with a fair amount of gimcrack movie making. There is no ending, to speak of - the story just stops for no reason.  Many situations set up earlier are left dangling and unresolved. In fact, the whole thing about what happens to the missing million dollars is just forgotten.I think most people will find something to laugh at and something to like when they watch this movie.

Really clever plot!What follows is predictable enough, in that the Dude and Walter become embroiled in a sequence of events which become increasingly bizarre as they fail to deliver the One Million dollar ransom.What is not predictable is the bizarre characters that the Dude encounters along the way that make this comedy so much more endearing than most.Another character that deserves a mention is Donny, the hapless member of the trio who passes almost unnoticed but this is nevertheless another good piece of work from this really good actor Steve Buscemi.So Overall this is a fine piece of work by the two Coen brothers and is one of my favourite movies I saw it when I was 13 years old and was blown away with laugher from watching this great comedy.I would suggest to all fans of Coen brothers or good comedy to see it.So The Big Lebowski deserves a full 9/10 stars.

Its continues to grow in the enigma that it must be liked, I must watch it again to discover the layers of film making brilliance like others have discovered...Just like pulp fiction before it, this is a story about nothing. If you watch any ordinary film enough times you can uncover a writers secret sin, their personal stories, their hidden tributes.There is very little plotting and the musical interludes are just meant to add to the intrigue of being unique and weird. If you find metaphors dropped around within them, congratulations but it's nothing you couldn't experience on YouTube. After all abstract art also has cult followings and million dollar price tags.Remember that heroic free citizen who didn't salute the national socialist party of Germany - who at the time hadn't done anything demonstrably murderous yet?

Kudos also to the terrific Swedish actor Peter Stormare in his 2nd go-round with Joel and Ethan Coen.  His screen time is minimal but memorable.As others have mentioned, be sure to give TBL at least 2 viewings before passing judgment on it.  I saw it for the first time when it first came out. I found it to be only average at the time.  Years later, a friend was howling about some of the great dialogue and urged me to give it another chance.  I'm glad that he did.The plot is certainly contrived.  But it's a character and dialogue driven comedy.  TBL may be the most quotable film of the last 10 years, if not of all time.

This rich, multi-layered comedy just seems to get better with each additional viewing--perhaps because no matter how hard you puzzle over the film, you'll never quite be able to understand everything about it at once.  I equate The Big Lebowski to 12 Monkeys in that regard--both films are wildly entertaining on the surface, slightly ominous underneath, and have moments of pure genius throughout.Each of the Coens' films seems to be their take on a certain part of the country, in particular criminal activity gone awry in each area--with numerous references to their favorite movies thrown in.  The Big Lebowski seems to take L.A. head-on and show us the city as something ""every bit as stupefying as in any of those other places"".  If Fargo and The Big Sleep are combined with modern L.A., The Big Lebowski would be the result. 
Jeff Bridges and John Goodman seem to be perfectly cast because their back-and-forth banter is hilarious.  I actually can't think of a character that I would have cast differently--every character is memorable and thoroughly entertaining in its own way.  The way they play off one another and affect the Dude's travels is just crazy. There is some really great writing in this film and the soundtrack is really great (especially the dream sequences).  If you only watch the movie once, you're probably missing a lot of things.I tend to like movies that break ""conventions"", and this is definitely one of those films.  The main characters aren't glamorous at all, the film's only sex scene is hilarious in contrast to the typical hollywood scene, and there isn't a coherent plot that can be outlined in a nice simple layout that everybody will understand.  Just like the main characters, the film seems to bumble around aimlessly--but all the bumbling somehow resonates with coherence by the time it's all over.You'll either love this movie or hate it.  If you're offended by drug use (even though the film hardly glamorizes the use of drugs--it shows what happens to the ""Dude"" after years of drug abuse... he's an unemployed former Roadie for Metallica...) or profanity (I think this movie probably set the record for the use of the F-word--but it's always sort of melded into the conversation and you hardly even notice it after a while) this may not be the film for you.  But I bet if you give The Big Lebowski a chance, it'll get under your skin.",The Big Lebowski
506,bw92116,The Big Disappointment,2,6 November 2006,"So I fell for all the hype, and finally rented this. Turns out it's an unimaginative storyline (lifted from any number of third-rate gangster flicks) peopled with one-dimensional cartoon characters and bogged down with a profanity-laden script that doesn't even offer one memorable line. If this is what passes for a ""great film"" in the current Hollywood climate, that only goes to demonstrate how far Hollywood has fallen from the glory years of the 1940s through 1970s.Jeff Bridges spends the entire movie doing his best Tommy Chong impersonation, John Goodman wastes his affable and agreeable screen presence on a Vietnam vet still fighting the war in his mind, and the rest of the characters are shabbily-conceived caricatures. The filmmakers desperately tried to make this ""hip"" by introducing a steady parade of John Waters-esquire ""oddballs"" but the ones in this film are like prefabricated oddballs they picked up on the clearance rack at Oddball-Mart, and have none of the quaint charm and humanity of Waters' characters.The inevitable plot twists and attempts at ""black humor"" are so predictable you can almost draw a schematic of the film while you're watching it. When one of the characters smashes up a shiny brand-new car, you can see the ""joke"" coming a mile away. Sorry, but I couldn't find anything in this film with any originality or even any entertainment value. If you're unfamiliar with the Coen brothers' films - trust me on this point: the only good film they ever made was ""The Man Who Wasn't There."" Rent that one and forget the rest.",The Big Lebowski

I doubt I've ever heard a better movie soundtrack.And don't you just love Sam Elliot as ""The Stranger"" - who blows mysteriously into L.A., like the tumbleweed in the opening scene.As for Philip Seymour Hoffman's role.......too much!And lastly, the ""Busby Berkely"" dance sequence....pure psychedelia!",The Big Lebowski
508,comco-1,"long, humorless film",2,31 August 2010,"This film was supposed to be a comedy, and I admit that the very last scene was funny, but the rest of the film had no humor. The tremendous dependence on a single expletive and its many forms became dull and boring after the first five minutes during which it was used about 100 times. The two scenes in which a topless woman appeared were obviously inserted just so she could be shown, but there was no point other than that one. The scene in which a Corvette was destroyed was completely predictable, and it unfolded in a strange way, and then faded away.Julianna Moore was the best part of the film, and Joe Pesci's talents were wasted on a trivial part for which he clearly had no enthusiasm.Jeff Bridges practiced in his role for his academy award as the character was identical.Once again, Hollywood insists that all drug usage is good, lack of moral character is good, drinking is good, and being a bum is good if you have a heart of gold.The film was long, too.",The Big Lebowski

Although the humour is sometimes silly at times (notabely John Goodman!) it is highly entertaining. His constant abuse of the Steve Buscemi character leaves me laughing everytime.Jeff Bridges' playing of the dude is probably equally as good as Goodman, cause let's face it, we all know somebody as fazed out as the Dude!This is a true comedy, and surely one that everyone likes?!",The Big Lebowski
515,zachmoats,The Coen Brothers flex their versatility with weird and zany,8,24 March 2017,"John Goodman and Jeff Bridges are an absolutely fantastic duo in The Big Lebowski. However, I want to talk about the direction of the Coens' for this film. The writing also reminded me of Thomas Pynchon's Inherent Vice a decent amount, and I definitely mean that as a positive.However, the Coen brothers' direction is for me what brings the other components of the film together. The film's weird psychedelic scenes, the slow motion bowling with John Turturro, and the wonderful use of space, particularly with the houses of the two Lebowskis, all add comedic, eccentric depth to an otherwise still funny movie. The trip The Dude takes when he lays down on his floor on his rug and starts flying is one of the psychedelic scenes that comes to mind. it feels so odd, but in another way, entirely right. John Turturro's (Jesus Quintana) character does not have much to him other than the beautiful slow motion bowling scene, but man is that enough. Finally, I got to thinking about the disparity of space between the two Lebowski places. The Dude's place is relatively small, but it's there that we go on a trip (and Treehorn's place, but that's for another time) that opens up to the whole city. Whereas when we are at The Big Lebowski's place, The Dude, Brandt, Bunny, and almost anyone who enters looks small in comparison to the space of the house. It's an interesting dichotomy that truthfully may not mean much, but it's something small (I guess pun intended) that makes the direction of the movie more special. It's also just a legitimately very funny movie that really does thrive off the duo of Goodman and Bridges. It's weird and it's frequently nonsensical, but it's still worth a watch.",The Big Lebowski

517,royals794,The Funniest Film of All Time,10,20 June 2008,"The first time I saw The Big Lebowski, I was incapable of speaking during the movie. It was literally so hilarious that I could do nothing but laugh during its running time; at some points, I was laughing so hard that I nearly fell off of my chair and tears ran down my face. I had already seen several Coen Brothers films before seeing this movie, including the masterpiece Fargo and the hilarious Raising Arizona, so I had high expectations going in. These expectations were more than exceeded; they were shattered by non-stop laughter. John Goodman gives perhaps the funniest performance in any movie I've ever seen and Jeff Bridges IS the Dude; nobody else could have played that role. The day after seeing it for the first time I watched it again, and it was even funnier than the first time, if that is possible. In the multiple viewings since then, I am still laughing out loud and finding new quotable lines. The Big Lebowski is rare in that it is not just hysterical but it is also smart. While I enjoy stupid comedies like Zoolander and Dumb and Dumber, it is so much better when the humor is both hilarious and clever. The Big Lebowski is the funniest movie I've ever seen and one of my all time favorites. I give it my highest recommendation: 10/10.",The Big Lebowski

The story, actors and the dialogue provide for a fun two hours. The story itself is not important, but it`s oddball cast of characters that makes the movie so funny and charming. Jeff Bridges gives one of his best performances of his career as The Dude, his extremely lazy lifestyle makes you laugh. John Goodman is good as The Dude`s best friend Walter, who is a Vietnam veteran, Steve Buscemi as the quiet but loveable Donny, John Torturro as the eccentric bowler Jesus, Peter Stormare as the former porn star and nihilist and Julianne Moore as Maude. Philip Seymour Hoffman and the rest of the cast also do a great job.  The Big Lebowski is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Especially the dream-sequences are cool and funny.

521,Hannibal_Chigurh,One of the Great Cult Classics,9,29 October 2007,"The Big Lebowski is perhaps the most surreal film from the Coen brothers, who have made their careers on surreal, dark comedies. There are numerous diversions, but the main plot is a take on ransom films. The film would have been a massive failure if not for some key performances. Jeff Bridges is The Dude, a.k.a. Jeff Lebowski, who is mistaken for a millionaire of the same name whose wife owes money to a pornographer. The Dude is an unemployed layabout who bowls with his two friends Walter and Donny. Walter is played by John Goodman, who portrays the character as a short-tempered Vietnam vet who uses his military service to justify his behavior. He constantly yells at Donny (Steve Buscemi) for no real reason, and waves guns at minor bowling infractions. The Dude finds himself caught up in the Big Lebowski's ransom as the millionaire hires him to give the ransom to the kidnappers. The millionaire's aide is Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who plays a sycophantic named Brandt. Hoffman is the third most enjoyable character in the film, with his forced laugh and yes-man lines.The simple ransom goes horribly wrong and the plot gets ever more complex as more characters are added. This one of a few comedies that warrants multiple viewings just to understand it. There are enough quotable lines to be entertaining upon first watch but you have to see it again to discern the genius of the plot turns.The dream sequences take away from the film as they are too long and don't really move the movie forward or even introduce a side-plot. Still, the film is one of the best Coen films (not as great as Fargo, but what is?) and it remains a cult classic and one of the best comedies ever made.",The Big Lebowski

I had to start it 4 times and by the 4th time I got over the first 5 minutes .. and boy was I hooked ! this is definitely one of the best of the Coen Bros., with a magnificent performance of Jeff Bridges (I think his best !) but also Turturro, Goodman, and Moore are a delight to see.

The 'Dude' and Vietnam vet. Walter (John Goodman) who thinks he is Jewish, are the main characters and are great fun in the movie and of course the mostly ignored Donny (Steve Buscemi). the acting, writing, directing and somewhat bizarre cinematography are amazing, if you like creative drama- comedies watch this film, if you don't watch it anyway.",The Big Lebowski

True it does seem to go all over the place, but in the end there are no loose ends that are left untied. An achievement that you don't see much in the mainstream due to the fact that they hope to make a sequel.After watching and laughing within the first five minutes of the film, I had to pause it every now and then to control myself before continuing. There's so much in this film to love that it is no surprise that film has gained a cult following. What I personally love about this film is how the Coens picked actors that actually looked like someone that you would find walking down the street or inhabiting the suburbs of America. Jeff Bridges just nails his famous role as ""The Dude"" and is part of the reason I think people like this film. The entire film is pretty much about an average guy thrust into this random stream of events and he's still trying to figure out what the hell is going on.If you haven't seen it, watch it.

528,gigabyte-me,Disjointed but often humorous.,7,22 May 2007,"This movie hosts a bold cast of characters but does little to piece them into the film properly.The Big Lebowski has it's comedic moments amidst a cornucopia of quirky scenes and larger than life characters. The plot, despite it's multiple twists is relatively simple. An aged hippie in L.A gets involved in a mock kidnapping plot all due to a stolen carpet and a case of mistaken identity.This type of plot, which is standard Cohen Brothers fare, does little justice to the film's often disjointed nature. There are scenes in this film driven by some colorful cameos that could have been entirely omitted from the movie with little or no consequence to the film's continuity. There are many cameos in this film by some obscure actors such as David Thewliss and Sam Elliot that feel more obligatory than necessary. There is also an entire scene that could have been omitted in the film. Jeff Bridges character is drugged by someone in the film. You get to see the entire insane dream he has while he's drugged. This to me was totally unnecessary and could have been handled so much better than a narcotics dream. This is not to say there isn't some original comedy to be found in The Big Lebowski. There are enough funny if not slightly bizarre moments to separate this film from standard comedic predictability. John Goodman does a stellar job as the main character's loud and lovable sidekick Walter. Jeff Bridges plays his character so well you forget he's Jeff Bridges. The faults of this film definitely don't lie in the acting. The Big Lebowski is hurt by it's slightly surreal nature, poor editing and excess of useless cameos and ambiguous characters.Overall this is a comedy that won't appeal to all fans of the genre. The sometimes artsy edge will turn some people off. It is also not the Cohen Brother's best effort in my opinion.",The Big Lebowski

There's so much absurdity in this film, but at it's heart is a character whose realness (in the sense of ""keeping it real"") grounds it all. So many things test the Dude's commitment to his own personal ethic and, in what is essentially a romp, the challenge to his moral compass creates layers one can't imagine from a synopsis of the film.And it's all perfectly executed: Jeff Bridges is fantastic, John Goodman simultaneously aggravating and charming, the dialogue so snappy and the one liners so quotable. Then there's the sort of soundtrack that filmmakers can assemble when they're at the top of their game and direction that doesn't intrude, except when it wants to.I hadn't seen this film for years, but there's so much going on I'm sure I could watch it again in a week and not be bored.",The Big Lebowski

An excellent performance from Jeff Bridges, who plays the hilarious ""Dude"", the stoner whose main love in life is bowling, and his main goal is to, well, do nothing. Bridges portrays the dude perfectly. His bowling buddy Walter (John Goodman) is in a word, classic, as the somewhat mentally unstable vietnam war veteran. Steve Buscemi has only a minor role as opposed to his larger role in Fargo, as Dude's other bowling buddy Donny, and Julianne Moore has an interesting  role as ""The BIG Lebowski's"" daughter, Maude.John Turturro is the show stealer of this film as Jesus the bowler, there is hilarious conflict between his bowling team and the Dude's team.All in all, the Coen brothers have succeeded, again!

536,clarkmc2,My Favorite Comedy,10,3 March 2010,"This has been my candidate for the funniest film I have ever seen, ever since I caught it at a last chance theater late in its initial run.It was a small theater in a multiplex. Total attendance was myself (solo), a thirty or forty something married couple, two young guys, a dating couple and another group of two or three college students.A group dynamic soon established itself. We all became so sore from laughing that no one wanted to be the initial victim of the next gag. But each time someone would start laughing and we all helplessly joined in, EVERY TIME.We really did think we could hold out once, but the next thing The Dude dropped the joint in his pants and his Torino ended up sideways in the alley. After that we gave up on even trying. It was the most powerful bonding experience I ever had with strangers in a theater.I have always been completely high on Jeff Bridges' talent, wondering why he was not appreciated like DeNiro, Duvall, Hackman, Pacino, etc. It seemed odd to me that he will probably be remembered for playing this part, but now I think that might not be a bad fate after all. I think he is like Robert Mitchum - the best Hollywood actor alive, under appreciated because he makes it look so easy. Lebowski is the perfect example of that. It looks like a simple acting job but no one could have done it better, or even as well.To give the Coen Brothers their due, the one-two-three roll of Fargo-The Big Lebowski-Oh Brother, Where Art Thou may be unmatched in cinema history.

Now why you should watch with your friends...If you expect a comedy just to laugh then you shouldn't watch. This is more than that, this movie talks about life, about irony and simplicity. Through simple scenes, thoughts, camera takes, and great act you will travel from well developed light comedy to some deep thinking about the way you face stuff.The movie is about who is the dude way of life and nothing more, so lets get to it.The dude is a simple guy and was interpreted perfectly, flawlessly. Everything he does you do with him, you feel with him, you think with him. You can see that he is not a simple character, yet you can grasp him entirely. And the most important about his character is that he is believable, real. This put together make you feel you can be him, can feel light as he does. That is what this movie is about, is about you going inside it and taste the ideas. Is about you freeing your mind and absorbing the entire set. And this is also why you shouldn't watch if you just want to laugh.I really don't have much else to tell you, I would easily spoil it all.

541,ocarina619,Not as good as people say,6,10 April 2004,"I have to say first off that this movie is not as good as people said it was, in fact I found it to be very disappointing.  The humor is subtle and in my opinion barely existant.  John Goodman was the main reason I continued to watch the film as he offered a character whose unpredictability sparked some interest in a almost uninteresting plot.Its not a bad film, it just never seems to go anywhere or offer anything. I'd recommend to watch it if you have the chance with nothing better to do, just for the sake of seeing a movie that isn't trash.  However at the same time, don't expect a masterpiece of cinema or a great film.The movie isn't funny for the most part, but I guess that depends on what makes you laugh.  In the end though, its safe to say I won't be watching this movie again.",The Big Lebowski
542,JimPearson,Why does a movie have to use such foul language?,1,30 April 2006,"I only recall one movie which had as much foul language as this: "" Planes, Trains and Automobiles"". I walked out of both after about twenty minutes. (I am sure there are others but I try to avoid them.) It is a sad reflection on today's society that writers and producers think that it is not possible to yet a laugh without lacing the dialog with obscenities in place of conjunctions. Maybe there was a story to this movie because others seem to like it. But if there was then I completely missed it. I think Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are good actors and this is one reason I checked out this movie but this one did nothing to enhance my opinion of them.Be warned: unless you are immune to the type of language which is all to prevalent in movies these days, give this one a miss.",The Big Lebowski

544,aspergian,Painful to watch,1,29 September 2018,"I had high hopes for this film. However, they were quickly dashed when I sat through this American drivel. The ""humour"" of the film consists of stilted acting, monotonous deliveries. All of these are probably deliberate and presented in a blatant sarcastic way that just passes as dull. It's way apparently really funny to focus your main character, who is a card board cut out dullard, to say mind numbingly unfunny things and all the banal phrases that are considered universal language to the club of a young generation at the time the film was released. The film is a testament to the recurring claim that Americans don't get irony and when they try to apply it they desperately grapple at it clumsily like in this film. It's probably the worst attempt at a comedy I've ever had the misfortune to witness.",The Big Lebowski

Looking at it after now 10 years after it was made is not only still a great laugh, but also inspiring. It's good now and then to get back in to rock and roll. I think the movie tackles important questions about life, in an intensely comical and intelligent way. I live in Europe and it might just be that people who are not so familiar with the American culture would not be able to catch the great humor, but I feel blessed to be able to understand the hero that the dude is playing. i truly wish i was like him. Detailed in every scene, rich characterization, diverse soundtrack, witty real life dialogue. This movie is God. I feel that it takes a lot from a movie to make me leave with a sense of satiation, but this movie does it for me. Wonderfully written and directed by the Coen brothers, it is yet another masterpiece from them. Another thing is, that this movie never tries to be funny. It doesn't have random quirky characters or punch lines, it all comes from the scenes, very naturally. And how cool is the scene when the sheriff throws and hits The Dude in the forehead with the mug, and the mug doesn't turn while it's in the air! So many great scenes.",The Big Lebowski

The big Lebowski's wife owns money to a porno producer, and then The big Lebowskis wife is kidnapped! The Dude is being the currier to the money that they are giving to the kidnappers (that is 1 million dollars), but The Dudes best friend Walter Sobchak gets the brilliant idea that they can keep all the money for themselves. The Coen brothers has made a movie that is impossible not to love, the characters, like The Dude(Jeff Bridges), Walter Sobchak(John Goodman), Donny(Steve Buscemi) and so on, is so original that you laugh at them, just by looking at them, and that i tell ya ain't bad, That this did'not won any Oscar is a big mystery. I now many people does'not think this, and i now that many people do think this, that this movie is better then Fargo(also made by Coen brothers), i mean Fargo was brilliant and it's also one of my favorites, but i think this is a little better, as i said, it's my #/&)&=& favourite!",The Big Lebowski

I kind of wish Steve Buscemi had a few more lines because he is excellent in everything he does. All in all, this movie has a solid storyline with great acting.

I have nothing against Jeff Bridges, I vaguely recall him from my young adulthood and I liked him in K-PAX. As the main character in this movie, his part was a slob. I don't know why this movie is rated highly. You would have to be a really great actor with lots of help from the creative departments to overcome the slobbery character. He didn't do it for me. Maybe it's the nostalgia that most people like. An actor must be enjoyable to watch, regardless of the character. This just wasn't.

That's what I love about this movie. There are so many subtleties, it makes for prime re-viewing action.
Jeff Bridges is awesome. Steve Buscemi is awesome. John Tuturro is awesome. John Goodman really should've been nominated for an Oscar. What the heck the whole movie is awesome.

There is nothing funny in it and I couldn't laugh even for once even though I tried. I really don't understand why this has such a good rating. It's such a usual Hollywood story with stereotypical characters. As soon as the daughter of Mr.Lebowski(the millionaire) appears, you know she is going to have sex with the main character. Such a stupid script and the message they give at the end is just for the sake of creating some sense to what they did with the movie. IMDb says they need ten lines of text in a review. Seriously?

However when it was all over you stopped to reflect on the movie that you just saw and realized you had no idea what you just saw? This movie is the story of Jeffrey Lebowski and his run in with Jeffrey Lebowski (The big Lebowski). In a variety of plot twists and turns with fake kidnappings and a pornographic producer looking for his payday, somehow unfolded in it all is a movie. Mostly considered to have darker films, the Cohen Brothers take a swing at humor. Even though they very much succeed, it all goes back to how much this movie makes no sense and goes nowhere. With their more serious movies they have first and second acts with conclusions and all. With The Big Lebowski things just sort of happen and then nothing at all. By watching the movie you get embraced into their world as if going on a vacation. You go there, and then you leave  you might have some fun, and some laughs, and you might not. Whether your experience is good or bad however, the discussions to follow the film will be anything but boring. Even if you didn't like the movie at all, the quotes you will be saying in the months to come will be ever lasting and unforgettable.

There are some fantastic characters in this, some great dialogue and funny lines (favourite - ""This isn't 'Nam, this is bowling. It has rules!""), good acting... But it doesn't add up to much. In fact the explanation for things is a bit of a copout. Furthermore, at other times the Coen brothers are just lazy - ignoring their fantastic talent with words they rely too often on boring and inane swearing. Swearing can of course be funny, here though it isn't. It's repetitive and dull. So this is an average film IMHO, a wasted opportunity, though it does have interesting bits. Julianne Moore even gives a dull performance. And you can always rely on her. Try other Coen brothers films - Blood Simple, their first, is possibly their best.",The Big Lebowski

Just check the huge list of 'quotable quotes' on this site and imagine them delivered by the excellent cast....some additional favorites:  The Big Lebowski to the Dude: 'Hello!  do you speak English?', the flunky bragging 'that was when she was first lady of THE UNITED STATES, not California...Mr. Lebowski DID meet with the president, unfortunately there was no photographer present' Dude replies 'Nancy's pretty good....' meaning as a trophy picture for the ego wall.

The script is amazing in that it keeps you guessing, introducing surprises all the way through, not just one Kaiser Soze-esque twist, but dozens of them.  And the direction is ingenious.

568,Lebowski85,Fantastic the first time and better from then on!,10,16 June 2006,"The Big Lebowski is a very clever, hilarious film that stands up to repeat viewings over and over again.The nature of the film is difficult to specify. Its a comedy that combines elements of surrealism with a decent sound track and visuals and is carried through with excellent performances by great actors playing very funny but unique roles. This is by no means a mainstream comedy. The story of this film, as you will find out, doesn't really stand out but what makes the film good is the acting, Direction and script which I'm sure every Big Lebowski Fan will tell you contains some of the best speeches and one liners ever written in my opinion.The Cohen Brothers in my opinion are fantastic directors for those who do not know, and their style can be seen throughout, using a very delicate balance of simple cinematography and music that wont excite the viewer but develops a pace which suits this film to perfection.All of the actors are superb, Steve Buscemi, Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are all amazing and in my opinion Goodman should have one an award for his role in the film. The film also contains various other special characters throughout which just works brilliantly.There are very few if any elements to this film that could be improved. Any angle to any aspect you can think of has been chosen and executed perfectly to leave the viewer happy afterwards. And as i said it stands up to repeat viewings. I have no idea how many times I've watched it but its a lot perhaps 30+ and its still just as funny.

Hard to believe when this movie came out in 98 it was a flop. Now it's one of the biggest cult followed movies ever. I have been a fan since I first saw it on
DVD when it first hit stores. One of the most quotable movies ever. This role of The Dude was made for Jeff Bridges and he is perfect. John Goodman is Bridges equal. The ying to the yang. Goodman is perfect also. There is so much to take in, so much comedy, so many great lines, great colorful characters. My favorite scene is where Donny passes and the get his remains, ""ashes"", in a coffee can. They go to scatter his ashes and they literally get them in their faces. Donny has the last laugh. OMG that is some funny stuff. The thing with this movie is you'll either love it or you'll hate it. There is no in between. Great actors, great dialogue, so much going on.

572,dudelebowskii,"Best Film Ever, Am I wrong?!",10,28 September 2004,"That's right. 'The Big Lebowski' is the best film ever and by reading many of the other IMDb comments I can see I am certainly not alone in that opinion. There are a few reasons why I happen to believe this to be numero uno. The dialogue in this film surpasses even that of 'Pulp Fiction'. Almost every line of the script is pure gold and if it does not bring the merest chuckle out of you then you are rolling around on the floor in fits of laughter.Obviously the 'Dude' is a legendary creation, played to perfection by Bridges, but just outshining him is Goodman as Walter. He is quite possibly the funniest character to be portrayed on screen. You only have to go to the memorable quotes tab on the column to the left to experience just how funny this guy is. His constant bringing up of the Vietnam war into literally any topic of conversation never ceases to be funny and the scene he smashes up that blokes car shouting 'You see what happens when you f*** a stranger in the ass!' is the best of all the classic scenes that make up this masterpiece.This is the one film I don't think I will ever get tired of watching.

573,KiltsMcGee,So flippin' good.,10,28 October 2014,"In spite of how brilliant this movie is, so few of my friends have ever seen it. I have never been in so many situations where my movie quotes have had to been explained. Clearly, this movie deserves far more recognition. It's the story of how a dude's rug gets pee'd upon and the cascade of events that ensue because of it.One of the great things about the movie is that when you are watching it, you know that there is something more than simply the story of a dude and his rug. Speaking of the dude, Jeff Bridges provides an iconic and by far the best performance I have ever seen from him. He is such a laid- back character who garners respect from all his comrades. You really can't help but sympathise with him. He spews some of the best lines heard EVER! John Goodman also plays one of the most memorable characters in existence. I feel that that is the thing that makes this movie so incredible. It's characters are immeasurably memorable (even Donnie who does almost nothing). I am going to need surgery to remove the memories of the movie (but I won't because it's excellent).Hmm let's see negatives. What did this movie do wrong. Perhaps you could argue that some of the characters come to nothing but you would be foolish because it all culminates with the brilliant line 'the dude abides'. It shows that so much has happened that at this point, Jesus (the bowler) doesn't to him. The investigator guy doesn't matter to him and most certainly the teenage car thief doesn't matter to him. I am really struggling here to find things wrong with this movie. The biggest criticism I have is on a purely mood scale. This movie is only watchable if you're in the mood for really thinking about a movie. If you're not just watch Anchorman.Clearly, I struggled finding anything wrong with this movie. There is so much to enjoy with the film and I am amazed that I had never watched it prior to a few weeks ago. Even saying it's great to think about deeply can be debunked. There is enough humour and captivating story for you to passively watch it. Just stop reading this review and go to Amazon. Buy the movie. Watch it as soon as possible.

574,Ledwek,A grower,10,30 April 2020,"I often say ""I've ruined too many classics for myself by watching them as a dumbass 14 year old that couldn't follow a simple story."" The Big Lebowski is a perfect example of that.When I first watched this film at the age of 14, it enraged me. I watched it twice in one week and concluded for years to come that The Big Lebowski is the most overrated piece of motion picture trash to exist on this planet. Hell this film caused my unbalanced teenage self to have an inner war with himself, and I wish I was joking, just cause I wanted so desperately to fit in with the masses who worship this film (before developing the maturity to... actually listen to dialogue or follow simple story beats like a normal human being).Four years down the line, after finally giving it a third spin, it was like a whole new experience. A thoroughly enjoyable one. I wish there was a way to wipe my mind of the 14 year old angst I poured into hating this movie and enjoy it with a fresh pair of eyes, cause it really is a unique, highly stylistic and memorable picture. There's so many genuinely funny concepts at play and unforgettable sequences.Only issues that remain today? I'm not the biggest fan of the ending. And this is by no means the film's fault, but the people that overquote this movie are extremely annoying and played a huge role in almost ruining it for me.

575,FLASHP01NT,The Big Lebowski (1998): Ideas and concepts:,8,22 January 2021,"My interpretation:The movie represents a wisdom tale of original sin.""The Dude"" is an egoless carefree state that represents innocence, the Garden of Eden, Gods will and/or Gods order.The Cowboy represents God. Lebowski represents man. The rug represents either A: women or B: materialism (I have not been able to deduce which one yet).The movie begins when The Dude abandons his carefree state and begins to seek the rug. At the point The Dude begins to seek the rug he is rejecting Gods order, and thus, becomes Lebowski. Lebowski is cast out of Eden, by God, into the Land of Nod, where he wanders encountering lies, violence, treachery and deceit.At the end, Lebowski has learned his lesson and regains Gods favor.

It's been out since 1998, have heard about it many times, even achieved the famed ""cult"" following but not until I saw an interview with Sam Elliot in which he said this movie was his personal favorite did I make an effort to watch it. Even the opening monologue by Elliot had me sitting on the edge of my seat...with the tumbleweed blowing and Elliot introducing us to ""the Dude"", and how in whatever time and place there always seems to be a guy that is designed to be there...a true man of his times...I was preparing myself for greatness. An then it just seemed to all fall apart. I thought I understood because I, too, consider myself ""the Dude"". Maybe not a man of times for the 90's but certainly for the 70s...I mean I was meant to be there. I understood everything about that world so maybe that was the problem. And then I thought maybe it was because I didn't grow up in LA. Maybe it's an ""LA"" things I was missing. I ended up fast forwarding through the middle of the movie because it was so boring and only gave it two stars out of homage to Elliot and Bridges whom I both admire.

577,aleksandersochan,An impressive depth of dialogue that requires a rewatch,8,12 December 2018,"I had seen this movie once before and got way more out of it when watching it recently for the second time.I think the complexity of dialogue is one of this movie's most fantastic aspects. Ironically though, I think it's also the reason I didn't like the film as much from my first viewing. I think this is also where the movie's rewatchability comes from. The dialogue is written in an extremely non-linear fashion. Often much of it has to be filtered through to follow the plot, as there can be so much going on in a scene. Upon my rewatch I was able to better follow and inspect what was going on in the more dialogue heavy scenes and when you're no longer struggling to just follow the plot, you can really appreciate the intricacies the Cohen brothers wrote into these conversations.I found the chaos of these dialogue scenes very humorous and you really get to see the dynamic of the Dude's friend group through these scenes. It's hilarious watching everyone talking to each other, yet so caught up in their own heads at the same time.The story and wildness of the tale is captivating and the wacky premise with which it starts draws you in quickly, especially with the way the Dude and his pals respond and react to the events that befall them.Julianne Moore's role in the film is one of my favorite and in my opinion most mastered storylines of the movie. Her introduction is particularly memorable and impressed into my brain.The narration in this movie fits well throughout and towards the end became one of my favorite parts of the film. It brings a whole new path to reflect about the movie on and does a phenomenal job at wrapping the narrative in a meaningful and expansive way that adds to the movie at the same time as it encapsulates it.The dream sequences provide nice intermissions to the story and are also hilarious as well as visually a joy to watch.My biggest complaint about the film has to be the potential for it to cause confusion in its complexity, but this is also what makes the movie so great and makes it worth watching again. I look forward to the next time I see this movie and anticipate my third viewing to be even more enjoyable than my last!",The Big Lebowski

579,His_Dudeness74,I can die with a smile on my face without feeling like the Good Lord gypped me,10,27 January 2006,"Without a doubt the funniest film I've ever had the privilege of watching. A magical brew concocted from a script over-flowing with multi-nuanced humour, masterful directing and a cast with the skill and understanding to pull it off.The plot is a loosely-rendered updating of Raymond Chandler's convoluted detective tales; in this film, the Coen brothers have replaced the genre's traditional anti-hero detective with a drug-addled aging Hippie, and if that makes any sense then all else flows from there ...Ruminations abound on the ultimate ineffectuality of both the militant and pacifistic factions of America's people, the story is played out in front of the backdrop of the Gulf War (which took place 7 year before the movie was made ..), giving the character's generally incompetent actions a resonance of futility - 'the people' are not only too ineffectual to change the world they live in, they also seem quite content to inhabit their garish world... the fact that the characters barely mention the War itself (besides Walter, an ex-Vietnam vet who's fascination with the killing fields knows no bounds)reflects on their general apathy - the Dude, the 'detective' (who is really a lazy hippie searching for his ratty-assed rug)in this tale, is from the flower-power generation, yet is completely unconcerned with the state of conflict his country finds itself in ... And yet this theme is not over-played, and the laughs come thick and fast, intellectual gags, observational humour, physical comedy, running jokes, character-based funny stuff - the strength of the actual comedy content lies in the sheer variety of absurdity the Coens manage to address in one film ... The two lead characters, the Dude (Jeff Bridges) and Walter (John Goodman) are wonderfully written and brilliantly performed. The support cast are just as wonderful, with Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro and Sam Elliott all playing their part in keeping the laughs coming ...The Coen's also introduce a host of eccentric bit-players into the mix; a gang of cricket-bat wielding German Nihlists, Knox Harrington 'the Video artist', the Dude's nervy landlord Marty, Porn King Jackie Treehorn, high school 'brat' Larry Sellers; these seemingly random characters help bring the Coen brothers' L.A. to vivid life ...The plot itself is full of red-herrings, and after laughing one's way through an initial viewing a few questions will be left hanging; and indeed some of the characters actions remain unclear after the credits have rolled; i.e. *did* little Larry steal the Dude's car ? *who* kept/had/lost the millions dollars ? *was* there a million dollars ?? - the whole chain of events is initially precipitated by a case of mistaken identity, and no-one, the viewers, the characters, seems to know exactly what's going on, adding to the free-wheelin', rambling feel ...The Coen's trademark razor-sharp dialogue has never been funnier than it is here, once you're hooked you'll never miss an opportunity to drop one of the endless hilarious quotes into conversation, and your friends won't mind as you'll have brain-washed them into loving this incredibly clever comedy film too ...

He creates mannerisms and habits that flesh out his character perfectly. From the first time we see him, Bridges is TheDude.

It gets better every time I watch it.

You have to watch the film to understandThe film is packed with funny lines from beginning to end. It has a languid, easy-going style which draws you in. The music and lighting, design and acting all combine to produce a superb mood. The gallery of characters is so colourful and off beat that there is literally not one dull moment in this beautiful hilarious film. The main idea is a simple one - imagine if a curious case of blackmail, kidnap and mistaken identity in the heart of Los Angeles were tackled, not by Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade, but by a clueless stoner who would rather be kicked out of a taxi on his way home from a night of beatings and druggings than listen to the Eagles on the radio? On which the fabulous Coen brothers add layer and layer of fantastic characters, each undercut by their vanity or madness or stupidity or other weakness, and each pushing the befuddled Dude further into a semi-conscious mess.Watch this film.

Every subsequent viewing has had me laughing harder and harder.  This movie has the most replay ability I've ever seen in my entire life.
The dialog is awesome, John Goodman's character reminds me very much of one of my friends.  Jeffery Lebowski is one of the greatest characters the screen will ever see.  I really don't enjoy Jeff Bridges most of the time; but it this movie he's so amazing.  He's like another person!  Buscemi is spot on as always, and the plot is amazing.The problems with this movie lie not in the work itself; but in its audience.  A lot of people will not like this movie simply because the first view only yields chuckles and chortles here and there and there are dream sequences.  The sound track is phenomenal though featuring loads of vintage music.I would recommend this movie to anyone who has patience, and anyone that likes character films.However if you're all about plot and action and don't understand character movies, don't see this one.",The Big Lebowski

Yeah, a little... it shows a lot of acid humor and sarcasm , which by the way I love....Otherwise, the movie lacks of consistency. or let me say, a spinal cord...it has great specific moments of excellence....although is not enough for pasting all of them into a unique brightness piece..... The storyline in general is poor...in my opinion.....sometimes I felt as if the movie has just stopped..... Look Burn after reading for instance.....it's the most great movie of Coen brothers.....I loved it!!! The main characters are great in The big Lebowski despite of their just passable interaction ....highlighting Jesus, who was by far my favorite character...appealing, flashy, arrogant and clueless at the same time... On the background I've enjoyed the subject, specially the greed, which is continuously at our side all the time.... live, and see how petty and greedy people are....

Confronted by kidnap, deception, extortion and German nihilists desperate for cash, he is alternately helped and hindered by his buddy, a Polish Catholic, 'Nam obsessed vet who thinks he's Jewish and who threatens fellow travellers who commit minor bowling transgressions with summary execution. The character is played with relish and perfectly by John Goodman in what may be his finest hour. Their bowling buddy, Steve Buscemi, is underused but sports his best crestfallen facade throughout and demonstrates first-rate comic timing as his character tries to get with the programme.The Big Lebowski is not for all tastes, but, if you get it, is one of the most engaging and side-splitting films around, and one which is eminently quotable: ""Walter, you're my friend and I love you, but sooner or later you're going to have to face the fact that you're a goddam moron.""If you don't get it, watch it again.

Jeff Bridges pulls off a marvelous incarnation of Gary Trudeau's ""Zonker"" in Gulf-War Los Angeles. I'm passionately in favor of Jeff Bridges working with the Coen brothers again. The only thing I wasn't crazy about were the spectacular dream sequences, which used huge sets combining Gotterdamerung with bowling and porn movies in what ended up being a little too much for my kitch sensors.John Goodman plays a Vietnam-veteran Jew-by-choice, and John Turturro creates a remarkable performance (as usual) as the fashion-conscious pederast, ""Jesus Quintana"".

One day he is mistaken for another man (a very wealthy man) with the same name by a batch of inept crooks who take his rug forcefully.

Now I don't think that Maude is a copy of Violet but if you listen to the way she talks and the way she leads a conversation you can hear a distinct similarity between them.  The best part of the movie to make this comparison is when Hepburn is showing Montgomery Clift around her son's garden and the way she talks about flowers and her niece Catherine (Elizabeth Taylor) and then compare that to when Maude first meets The Dude and she is talking about art, the female form, sex, and her step mother Bunny.  I don't know, maybe it's just me.

Beyond being humorous from both a character and a situational point of view, it has a near genius way of combining the extraordinary with the mundane, putting The Dude in a situation which he does not fit into at all. The outrageous exploits of just about every other character, including the Dude's friend Walter and his rich and powerful counterpart, also named Jeff Lebowski, are made even more outrageous in the fact that the Dude just wants to lay back, smoke a joint, and not get involved in any of this.The overly hyped exaggeration of the mystery plot, combined with the extremely downplayed acting of Jeff Bridges as the Dude, make this film work on many levels, and the irregularities of every character really play off each other, especially between John Goodman and Jeff Bridges. John, as the Dude's friend Walter, is such a huge presence with his wild outbursts and near frantic insanity, that it winds up the Dude's already seemingly high-strung personality and creates a great contrast that really made me respect John's acting abilities.Overall, the great dialogue, both subtle and blatant humor, and excellent mix of situational and character comedy make this a film that I will definitely recommend for just about any collection.",The Big Lebowski

607,saultonofswing,"The Best Comedy Ever Made and one which I could watch forever, dude!",10,7 August 2002,"This movie is the reason why movies are made.  It is fun, funny and yet carries a message with it of dire consequences for ones actions.  Though set in the time of operation desert storm, the jokes, punchlines, anecdotes and characters are not dated one bit, and neither are the reacurring references of politics, lingo and expresssions like ""chinaman"", ""nialist"", ""johnson"" or ""dude"".  I never thought the word dude could be personified into so many different verbs, adjectives or nouns, that a simple story involving a kidnapping mixed with bowling could be so complex with so many different characters yet be so intricately structured that it is still simple to comprehend, with every character uniquely created while still commanding multiple viewings.  The character of the Dude, based on a friend of the Cohen brothers, is expertly played by Jeff Bridges as a simple stoner who loves White Russians, bowling and is overwhelmed by all the attention suddenly paid to his quiet existence by a chance of mistaken identity. His friends are the hilarious John Goodman playing a divorced converted Jew who frequently references ""'Nam"" in inappropriate instances, repeatedly asks ""Am I wrong?"" in an attempt to justify his actions and still acts like a soldier past him prime, pulling guns and uzis out to keep the world sane.  Steve Buschemi, John Tutturo and Philip Seymour Hoffman both offer hilarious quips, questions, quotations and funny accents to add to the insanity. Add in Julian Moore and Tara Reid in early yet believable performances and a masterpiece is formed.  Every piece of dialogue is a quotable quote, every scene is expertly woven, every character is well structured and every joke is fully explored.  Theres no dumb pot humour here, only intelligent jokes with some of the best physical abuse comedy ever set to the music of Creedence Clearwater, Bob Dylan's 'The Man in Me', Kenny Roger's 'What Condition my Condition was in' and the Eagles 'Hotel California' in Spanish. This is not only the best bowling movie ever made, the best Cohen brother movie ever made, and the best comedy ever made, it is also one of the best if not the best movie ever made and it only gets better every time you watch it.  The phrase may be cliched but this movie is the one that made it so. And if you see one movie for the rest of your life, make it this one. 11/10",The Big Lebowski
608,Aragorn___,"Put simply, a marvellous film and a must see",10,28 June 2002,"To say this film is a masterpiece is perhaps a little generous, however, it is not far off.  The Big Lebowski is a tribute to the real people out there; people trying to get through life exerting the shortest amount of effort necessary whilst drifting in and out of trouble.  I think this sums up the film perfectly.  I've watched this film so many times and I still can't find anything wrong with it.The acting is sublime, Jeff Bridges is at his comic best and with John Goodman and Steve Buscemi as support there's always going to be laughter and suspense.  The script is faultless; each person blends into the script with effortless precision resulting in a feeling that the actors really ARE the people they're playing which makes it all the more better because you feel their joy, their anguish and their feelings of the often baffling but wonderfully written events happening around them.Not only is the acting sublime, aswell as the script and directing, but the musical score is so good you think that the songs were written especially for the film with them evoking a feeling of lazyness, a feeling of laid back carefree attitudes which in a way is what the film is all about.  In essence, as a whole; acting, script, directing and music, this is the ultimate feel good buddy film and is an absolute must, a real modern classic work of film-making and shouldn't be missed.  I feel it must be watched from start to finish though, without any breaks, to fully grasp the magnitude of this film.10/10. - splendid, one for the collection.",The Big Lebowski

The other man's wife apparently has a lot of outstanding debts and the ruffians who pay Jeff a visit urinate on his rug before he finally convinces them he's NOT the rich husband they're looking for.  He's simply a bum known by everyone as ""the dude"".  The dude decides that if he simply visits the rich guy with the same name, he can probably talk him into replacing his rug, since technically they were supposed to have urinated on the rich guy's rug instead.  The rich fellow, however, tells the dude that his wife's been kidnapped and asks the dude to carry the ransom money to them.Why?  Good question... and from there, the story gets even more confusing and pointless.  Which, the filmmakers freely admit.  On the DVD version, the filmmakers frankly state that the confusing plot takes a back seat to the quirky characters we get to meet.  Oh joy.They even admit that when one of the actors asked what his character's motivation was, or why he was even in the story - they didn't have an answer for him.  They say this laughing (at the viewers?).Anyways... the only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the visuals and transitions are unique and creative, and that Jeff Bridges proves again that he's such a good actor he can even come out shining when buried under a pile of feces.  His portrayal of the dude is priceless - and he doesn't dance half-bad either.",The Big Lebowski

These brothers seem to be masters at the medium of film. Every single line of dialogue in this movie has a way of being seen as funny, even if you can find a line in the film that isn't very obviously comedic. The film is genius in the way that through all it's seeming simplicity, through all that it seems to focus on the ridiculous plight of a stoner attempting to solve a mystery, it harbors a deep philosophy, a sort of live and let live philosophy. In other words, the Dude Abides. The three main performances, those of John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, and Steve Buscemi, are expertly played, as are the majority of the roles, including Philip Seymour Hoffman, Julianne Moore, and John Turturro. Also, the music in the film, as some people have pointed out, is much like a character in the film. And it just 'fits right in there' to quote the Stranger. The movie is fantastically rewatchable.

The music is fantastic and really thought-through. You get introduced to The Dude and his world and soon you realize that you never want to leave.

613,solidchuck19,This...this is not a worthy adversary...,10,12 February 2007,"This is a film that is hard to describe. When anyone asks what it's about, I just say, ""The Dude"".The plot is simple, but well-written. The characters are great, and the dialogue is really nothing short of perfect. This is coupled with star talent used to its fullest potential. There is no one else who could be The Dude, Jeff Bridges just is. John Goodman is hilarious as the short-fused Vietnam vet Walter, and Steve Buscemi plays a different role than usual, but he still is given great moments because the three main characters play off each other so well. The script is endlessly quotable.Now this is not to say that the dialogue and characters alone make the movie funny. Comedy bleeds through at almost every scene in the unusual locations and series of events that occur. Maybe the funniest scene ever in a movie to me occurs when The Dude gets his car back and good old CCR comes on the radio playing ""Lookin' Out My Back Door,"" and Dude pounds on the roof, drinkin' a beer and smokin' a jane all at the same time, and he of course ends up crashing into a dumpster. Total Classic.But maybe one thing that I find so great about this comedy is that even though I've seen it five or six times in the past couple years, I always see something or get something new, every time. And everyone should dig the idea that The Dude really is someone we all could learn from. I mean, he really just doesn't care about the views of him from society. He just lives as he wants, and he doesn't hurt anyone.Now I'm not saying he's a hero, because what's a hero? But sometimes, there's a man, and I'm talking' about The Dude here. Sometimes, there's a man, who, well, he's the man of his time and place. He just fits right in there.",The Big Lebowski
614,iollann,Great film 'The Big Lebowski',9,15 March 2017,"Review: 'The Big Lebowski' 'The Big Lebowski' by the Coen brothers is a great film because of its great characters. The cast includes Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, John Turturro and many more. 'The Big Lebowski' released in 1998 is a quirky crime comedy about an unemployed slacker from L.A who is drawn into a world of kidnapping after being mistaken for a washed up millionaire of the same name. To summarize it 'The Big Lebowski' is about 'The Dude' a slacker and a keen bowler, when two enforcers show up at his house demanding money, having mistook him for a millionaire with the same name and urinating on his carpet, he is plunged into a world of deceit, kidnapping and much more in the pursuit to be compensated for his ruined carpet. A summary of the plot does not do this film justice. The character of 'The Dude' is brought to life by the outstanding performance of Jeff Bridges. The dude has so many hilarious quotes and back and forths with his counterpart 'Walter' played by John Goodman. Jeff Bridges seamlessly plays 'The Dude' with laid back perfection. I was disappointed though with Steve Buscemi's character 'Donny' having very few lines in the film although whenever he does talk he is usually told to shut up which can be quite funny. Another film by the Coen brothers called 'Fargo' has Steve Buscemi in a much bigger role than in this one and he is excellent in 'Fargo'. I would have preferred if he was given a bigger role like in 'Fargo'. John Turturro has a hilarious performance as 'Jesus' but little screen time. During the film's spectacular dream sequences are used with great effect. The soundtrack for the film is very good too. In conclusion 'The Big Lebowski' is more about the characters than the plot. I would recommend this film too everyone and I would give it a 9/10. It is my favourite Coen brothers' film and my favourite film with Jeff Bridges in it that I have seen.",The Big Lebowski
615,Shannon38,A celebration of the ultimate man,9,8 September 2008,"It's easily better than Fargo, IMHO, and it's right up there with Barton Fink or Miller's Crossing. A true comedy classic with so many memorable lines and characters, but it's the movie's atmosphere which is so truly joyous, a wonderful celebration of basically doing nothing. Achieving one's goals is important, yes, but it's okay to set them low, is what I perceived this movie to be saying. As long as one is basically a good guy, then that's enough. Well, that's what it seemed like to me, and it was expressed so beautifully in the stunning cast of grotesques, lovely music ( although more Burwell would have been nice ), and the trippiest, funniest, most absurd dream sequences you've ever seen. If you're a type A personality, you might not like this movie much, but for the type B's, and further on down the alphabet, (the further the better) Great Movie!",The Big Lebowski

With ""The Big Lebowski"", the Coen brothers not only did a good movie, but a truly excellent comedy. I was laughing so hard when I saw this movie that I almost cried. I have seen it three times now and the impact is always huge, it's hilarious. It's also smart, full of quotable lines and remarks, and gripping to the very end... in fact I was enjoying it so much that I didn't want it to end!

I am shocked that Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, who have had such exceptional roles in movies and TV would lend themselves to this movie. Acting was so over the top in the pursuit of lampooning stereotypes, that I failed to see the humor. I suppose some of the action was meant to be slapstick but only seemed stupid. The movie was so gratuitously laced with obscenities throughout that it seemed to serve no purpose and lost its shock value after the first couple of minutes. The only redeeming value of this movie are some of the interesting camera shots like the bowling ball cam and some of the hallucinatory dream sequences (and the soundtrack). The Coen brothers have been asked if they came up with this storyline while under the influence.

The double-dealing twists and turns can't hold a candle to the level of intrigue in Miller's Crossing (nor the humor, which is mostly missing in Lebowski), nor does it have the dramatic photography of Fargo, which it resembles quite closely in both plot and tone, to keep it interesting.  It is a luke-warm film that could have easily been directed and written by any of a dozen writer/directors out there.  While there are a few quotes, they are fairly few and far between, and do not stand on their own in any meaningful way (and to all you who think ""The Dude abides"" is a great quote, then you know why I call this the lowest common denominator). To paraphrase from an earlier Coen film, ""we all have that Coen Brothers feeling, but since this film was by the Coen Brothers, we figure it should have it in spades.""

623,fuzzy_nolan,Absolutely nailed by the Coens (and Bridges).,9,24 April 2002,"Similar to the measured brilliance of Fargo, the Coen Brothers, Joel and Ethan, again delivered a perfectly structured and aimed tribute to the slacker in all of us. The slacker in question is Jeff Lebowski, self-proclaiming himself 'The Dude'.  Jeff Bridges gives a startling performance far from his usual troubled, semi-action roles like Blown Away and Arlington Road and proves himself to be one of the most consistently underrated actors in Hollywood. The Dude reigns supreme in his own personal sphere of Creedence, White Russians and, above all, bowling.  The performance, I think, can be favourably compared to his last great role in Fearless and Jeff Bridges can be proud of his work. As can John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, (even) Julianne Moore and, most hilariously John Turturro's cameo as Jesus the uptight, paedophilic rival who represents everything The Dude dismisses.  It seems a brilliant quality in a director (I'm talking about Joel Coen here) to consistently extract good performances from any actors, regardless of their standing in Hollywood. I could keep on about the relaxed directing or the inspired music selection, both perfectly complementing the ideals vaunted by the film... but I won't.  Every aspect of this (and every other Coen Bros.) film is succintly placed within the whole. It is this film particularly that makes the Coens directors/writers ones to watch.  And remember to take the advice proffered to the heart... The Dude (in all of us) abides.",The Big Lebowski

625,arodmitton,Great showcase of talent,8,2 April 2012,"""The Dude"" Lebowski just wanted to get his rug replaced. After a couple of thugs mistaken ""The Dude"" for a big shot millionaire of the same name and urinate on his rug. This simple act of degradation starts the Dude on a path of absurdity involving a trophy wife, German nihilists, a crippled millionaire, a neo-expressionist feminist artist, kidnappers, a Vietnam veteran and porn producers, all vying for a million dollars in cash. To further complicate matters, the Dude has to deal with a ""good ol' boy"" police system and a bumbling private eye.Complications, idiots, schemes, cons and double-crossing are all ingredients needed to make a successful Cohen brothers film, and that is exactly what this is. One of the Cohen brothers biggest hits, The Big Lebowski is considered one of the best ""cult-classics"" of all time. In true Cohen brothers form, this film is packed with big name stars that all turn in superb performances. Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julliane Moore, Steve Buscemi, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Peter Stormare, and David Huddleston are all on top of their game and the Cohen brothers bring out the best in them. The Dude Lebowski, who wants nothing more than to bowl with his friends in a local bowling league, gets wrapped up in a kidnapping plot involving a million dollars. Of course, there are several other players that are interested in obtaining that cash. A true anti-hero, the dude is a remnant of the late sixties counter-culture movement, living in the late 90's as he lived back then, smoking weed, drinking white Russians, and just taking it easy. As the Dude stumbles throughout the film in his own lovable way, he starts to figure out all the ins and outs and ""what-have-you's"" of the current game being played by the players in the film. Very, very loosely based on the Raymond Chandler novel ""The Big Sleep"", The Big Lebowski pays a certain amount of homage to the original source material, without being an obvious portrayal of the novel. The Cohen brothers have successfully transformed the gritty, hard-boiled detective's novel into their own unique form of comedy and entertainment. And as in other Cohen brothers works, the mystery doesn't ravel in a traditional form, with all the answers being given to you at the end with an exposition. Instead, each sub-plot ends at some point in the film and you, the film-viewer, are responsible for picking up that fact. One of my favorite aspects about the Cohen's is that they respect the audiences intelligence a bit more than most, thereby, not patronizing with endless exposition.A smart, slick comedy, this film is highly recommended for those who enjoy films that fall under that category. The excellent acting and directing by all involved have truly formed a ""cult-classic"".""The Dude abides. I don't know about you but I take comfort in that. It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners. Shoosh. I sure hope he makes the finals."" –The Stranger",The Big Lebowski
626,velvets203,Coen Brothers comedic masterpiece,9,12 January 2005,"Even with Raising Arizona on their cinematic belts, the Coen Brothers made their comedic masterpiece in this triumph of a comedic movie. (Is it the highest rated comedy on the top 250??) This movie defined my college years, as people had ""Lebowski parties"" with White Russians, (etc) and the movie going the whole time. People just could not stop watching and re-watching this movie. Instead of the typical slapstick, gross out, or physical comedy that has so dominated movies since the 1990's, BL uses slick writing, creative characters, and a convoluted, but fun plot to make the audience laugh. No lame sex jokes or tense moments between a female and male, nothing forced or built up to force us into laughing; just good old fashioned hilarity. The entire movie has become quotable, with John Goodman providing most of the lines with his over the top character. It is such a classic that I know many a person who knows the entire script almost line for line, like it's Star Wars or some other cult movie. It even makes Jeff Bridges always seem to be ""the Dude"" to me now, even when I see him in movies he performed in well before this movie. All the actors put in fine performances, with Steve Buscemi and John Turturro making their regular Coen Brothers appearances. Some people may take this movie too seriously, and I am sure if one does one would scoff at its high ranking. But don't let yourself become a cinematic elitist, just relax, and realize that this is one of the reasons why people make such a big deal about the Coen Brothers. A unique film that deserves credit for taking chances, but for also being intelligently written. Incredible laughs, and relevant, caring characters force me to give this a 9, or A-",The Big Lebowski
627,miko4444,Gets better with repeat viewings,8,26 May 2003,"One of those rare films that gets better with repeat viewings.Aside from the hilarious writing and acting, we have a homage to every Marlowe/Archer/Sam Spade film every made. The young out of control wife, the rich old disabled husband, the eccentric strong minded daughter, the sinister pornographer, the beach town sheriff...The premise of the film was: what would happen if you threw a man like the Dude into a typical L.A. film noir mystery? How would he cope? What would he do? Not much to base a film on, but it works.Throughout the film, Bridges in the character of the Dude drifts like a beach ball in a swimming pool, bouncing off the sides, going in different directions. Listen to what he says, recycling everyone else's thoughts and words. He is a mirror reflecting everything back. In many ways, he is infantile. His ""beverage"" of choice is a sweet milky White Russian. He listens to a recordiing of a bowling game while immersed in his tub, a womb like scene. The Dude avoids pain and suffering, which means he avoids growing up.Ah, the writing! In the beginning of the film, there is a scene in the bowling alley with Goodman, Bridges, and Buscemi discussing Bridge's problem. Those few minutes of dialogue are some of the funniest ever written, but the scene wouldn't work without the subtle acting and sharp timing. John Goodman owns the film; he takes his gift for comic acting to a new level. His character is full of rage and love -- he's a typical man. :)Also rare in the film: every camera shot adds to the drama and meaning. It's a visual feast. The Coen brothers scatter references and clues and jokes throughout the film -- only repeat viewings will show you the detail.

The film didn't really seem interesting after the first viewing, but when I saw it the second, third time (repeats on cable TV), I realized I was expecting some kind of a plot. But there's hardly any in the film. Instead, the film is full of brilliant dialogs, comic situations, ""the female form"" and sree lingonberri pancakes. Actually, if I was to quote my favorite lines from the film, it would probably take half a page.

It's far more original than most movies.And while there's several scenes that are a stretch, to say the least, realizing that they come from the dudes imagination somehow make them that much more acceptable.

The humour varies from sight gags to plots twists and back again. The music is also great, it adds to the overall feel of the film really well. Add to that, it's a film with bowling in and you cannot go wrong. One of my favorite movies of all time. SEE IT.",The Big Lebowski

637,paolobut19,Perfection,10,28 September 2004,"Cash Converters has thrown up some real gems in its time, but The Big Lebowski is without doubt the best £2 I have ever spent in my life. Once again the Coens showed their undoubted genius which, if I had my way, would result in the bestowing of an honorary knighthood upon both of them. And if I know our queeny, which I'm sure I think I do, then one look at the Dude, Walter and Donny and the decision would be made for her. Unfortunately I would imagine that snapped up the only copy ever to be seen in the Converters (what fool sold this? Put him in the stocks!), so she might have to splash out a bit more than I did.Now, compared to their other classics (which is pretty much everything they've done), this may not have the original impact of Blood Simple, the sublime acting of Fargo (think William H. Macy and Frances McDormand), or indeed the insane imagination of O Brother, Where Art Thou. However, what separates Lebowski from the others is the almost unbelievable volume of hilarious characters. Every single character, without fail, is so funny that the only disappointing aspect of the film is that you can't watch more of each of them. Jesus Quintana (the brilliant John Turturro), is probably only on screen for about 5 minutes, yet he is quite possibly one of the funniest characters of all time - ""You show your piece on the lane again, I'll take it off you and stick it up your a**e!"". The Nihilists are scarily funny, no more so than when they are being taken apart by Walter, in a fight scene that tops even Motorcycle Gang. And though he barely says a word, you can feel nothing but complete sympathy poor old Smokey when, in a truly poignant scene and beautifully acted scene, he is accused of stepping over the line by Walter (unjustly I feel). But it is the Dream Team trio who stand head and shoulders and upper arm above all of them. Tragic, put-upon Donny (we will truly miss you son), scarred Vietnam war-hero Walter (""This isn't 'nam man, there are rules!""), and, of course, The Dude, who is quite simply a Dude.These characters would stand alone without a decent script and still entertain for the entirety of the film. But this is the Coen Brothers, who write such consistently, and astonishingly funny scripts that you wonder how they keep doing it. When they are on top form, which they are pretty much permanently, they make films of near perfection that other directors and script-writers could only dream of.The Big Lebowski may lack the supreme cleverness of other Coen films, but it is undoubtedly their funniest, and all you can do is watch in awe at the onslaught of brilliant characters. The day they stop making films will truly be a mournful one.",The Big Lebowski

The Big Lebowski, though it may have a dull plot, has perfect acting by all the colorful, well-portrayed characters. Every scene is a tribute to greatness, from the very beginning, to the very end. Even though it came out nearly ten years ago, it has still yet to be matched by another comedy. I've found that it is a seriously underrated movie. Shadowed by mediocre comedies like Wedding Crashers and Talladega Nights, it has amassed a gigantic cult following. For good reason, too. It is flawlessly directed, flawlessly casted, and flawlessly acted. Despite it's irreverence and relentless profanity, it actually has an almost touching ending. Definitely a classic movie.

642,GideonPope,Biggest Movie Disappointment of My Life,1,5 March 2011,"I like non-main stream flicks - Blue Velvet, Boxing Helena, and so on. I like comedy that is not dependent on stupid sight gags or scatological humor. This movie had been out for a few years before I watched it. It was, I had heard, a gem that was waiting for me. I had looked forward to it greatly.I didn't find any aspect of the movie funny, other than the enigma that it's well liked by many.I suppose this is where I differ from most - I don't find a guy walking around with a mixed drink all the time funny. I don't find Dan Conner overreaching as a guy who is a Vietnam vet freaking out about anything funny, particularly because that's been done before. I don't find the Italian guy acting fooling while bowling to be funny. I don't find referencing a guy as ""the dude,"" with article obligatory, to be funny. And on and on. What's funny? Dennis Miller. He's funny. George Carlin. He's funny. The Big Lebowski - not funny.I really don't have any comment on the ins and outs of the movie.

643,pqshindelus,"Most unique, most funny comedy I've seen",10,19 May 2009,"Possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen. Perfect character development and acting combined with an out-there but flawlessly-interwoven series of plots are the perfect combination for laughs. I can't get enough of this movie, and neither will you.This story follows three bowling buddies- Lebowski aka ""The Dude"" (Jeff Bridges), an aging burnout hippie with a carefree, laidback manner; Walter (John Goodman), a large Vietnam War veteran who approaches his daily life and philosophy as if he were still at war; and Donnie (Steve Buschemi), a dimwit follower placed mostly for comic relief. A case of mistaken identity gets the three caught up in the aftermath of a kidnapping, and watching their antics as they try to sort their way through the situation is as funny a thing as I've seen.I think the beauty in this movie is that there don't have to be any jokes or actual attempts to be funny to produce a laugh. The characters, just by being themselves, make the movie funny. Every scene where they're in the bowling alley talking to each other- there's no joke or attempt at humor, just a burnout, a dimwit, and a gun toter with post-traumatic stress disorder sitting there talking for five minutes, and I die laughing. Heck, there doesn't even have to be dialog! The scene where Lebowski is driving down the road smoking a roach- two minutes go by from start to end without an intelligible word of dialog, and I must have laughed 3 times. Or his reaction to being forced in the limo (""Watch out, there's a beverage here!""). He was being serious, and that by itself made it funny. Just by being themselves, the characters are funny and hence the movie is funny. Well, that and a few well-placed dream sequences! If you haven't seen this movie, drop what you're doing and run to the video store. You are in for a treat.",The Big Lebowski
644,Comic_Book_Guy,Allegorical Genius,10,22 December 2004,"The Big Lebowski is rare in the world of motion pictures. It's like a well written book (like Dune or LOTR) in that you can walk away with something new from it with each repeated viewing. The Cohen brothers put a lot of thought into their films, and the Big Lebowski is no exception.Talking crap about a movie is the easiest thing to do, and I've read a few reviews that have done just that about Lebowski. In these people's defense, it's easy to jump to this conclusion because at first glance, it appears to be a meaningless film. But if it were meaningless, why set the film during the first Gulf War? Why do a period piece set 7 years before the movie's release? Because they're playing with allegory here, trying to say something about America.There is much evidence of this. The perceptive viewer will note that we're dealing with clearly cut characters that embody archetypes of American culture. We're also dealing with events that mimic the political and sociological landscape of 1991. In addition, most period pieces splash nostalgia all over the screen, but there's hardly any in Lebowski. This movie is a humorous, tongue-in-cheek statement about the health of the American character circa 1991.But even if you take the meaning of the movie out of the equation, The Big Lebowski is a top notch film. The characters and their interactions in the movie are entertaining. The direction plums the depths of their potential and brings it out for us to enjoy. The scenes work to promote the themes of the movie and give us a good laugh in the process. The Cohens did their job and then some on this one, and it seems to me like they had a damn good time doing it.",The Big Lebowski

I can watch the movie several times and see something new simply because of the acting. There is no one who can play the dude better than Jeff Bridges. The role was made for him. The plot twists and ongoing zany adventures kept me smiling throughout the film. UNTIL THE END. SPOILER: Donny dies. What a bummer. I thought this ruined the movie.

648,vocator,Funny but chaotic,7,10 June 2020,"The story of ""The Big Lebowski"" felt very chaotic while watching. Sometimes I could not see a common theme in the story, and that is probably what made it a bit boring at a certain point for me.What is better than the story itself are the characters and the dialogues between them. This is what gives this movie its comedic value in my opinion. Memorable quotes combined with a great cast. John Goodman as a Vietnam veteran who sticks to his past and Jeff Bridges as a jobless hippie who wants to be called ""The Dude"" were a perfect casting choice. It felt like those two were born just to play these roles.Ethan and Joel Coen created something that today still holds as one of the best comedic movies. I think watching this a second time will make it funnier than it was the first time.That's why ""The Big Lebowski"" (1998) gets from me 7.0 out of 10 points.",The Big Lebowski
649,danielsty,"""Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.""",7,27 April 2020,"WHAT I LIKE:
I believe everyone has a little bit of The Dude in them; I know I have it. This film is funny without ever trying to be; which is a big contrast to the over-the-top comedies of the '90s like Dumb and Dumber (1994) and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994). The comedic nature of this film is more in-line with films like Bill Murray's classic, Groundhog Day (1993); with a pinch of stoner element, a dash of crime mystery and a spoonful of subtle political undertones thrown into the mix. On top the that, the visually-stunning representation of a stoner's psychedelic journey and the sharp (witty) dialogues are also worth mentioning. Most of the actors and actresses in this film are acting heavyweights; so you don't have to worry about bad acting. Strong performances overall; especially by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.WHAT I DISLIKE:
I am not going to lie; this film does lack a little in the plot department; which was redeemed by the quirky humours and the strong performances by the cast. This film is meant to be a quirky, idiosyncratic comedy; instead of a highly-analytical crime thriller that many had hoped for. This film is laid with a complex theme; deceit ciminality and death; which were swiftly diffused by the situational comedies. How could you cry for someone when the next thing after his/her death was his/her ashes flying right onto your face?",The Big Lebowski

651,Ash-37,Coen brothers unabashedly out of control! A plethora of fun!,8,17 August 1998,"The Coen brothers are up there with my very favorite filmmakers (Scorsese, Kubrick, Carpenter).  I am very fond of their work.  Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes.  Their best stories evolve from  kidnapping schemes in films like ""Raising Arizona "" and ""Fargo"", one of my very favorites.  I thought that film was fervently free.  I was so ever wrong. It's as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter.  The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug.  This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins.  We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates.  This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and 'Nam veterans.  This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it's so grandiosely different.  Yet who couldn't chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball's finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus! I will disclose no more, but urgently recommend you to traverse to your nearest video abode and rent this true escapists' feature. Abandon all solemn inhibitons, though!

652,Jeff-370,It's really hard to get enough of this film,10,27 July 2000,"Speaking as a guy who like his art film, including Ingmar Bergman works and the more heady Coen Brothers films, please believe me when I say I would not expect to like a movie with such low-life urban American characters and swearing.No, I would not have expected it, but there it is. Something about the constant use of the f-word and they way these characters say it is just funny. Add that to the fact that the plotline is well-constructed with several amazingly humorous moments in the dialogue, and I think it's reasonable to call The Big Lebowski as classic.Of course, the well-constructed plot only matters when you're done watching it and you actually have time to think about the course of events. During the movie, it's too easy to focus on the dialogue, which, while emphasizing the speech patterns of those not as skilled in language, makes great use of a wide range of speech characteristics, from John Goodman's character's rants to The Big Lebowski's (the other Lebowski) educated dialect. And, of course, Maude Lebowski's feminist rhetoric. (""Some men find it very uncomfortable to say. Vagina."") The dialogue is actually intelligent, at least in the way it's written. It's easy to forget that when you can see the characters delivering the lines.It's quite hard to say enough about this movie, but I'll sum it up here: I laughed. Hard. I often find things in movies that make me chuckle, but this one makes me laugh over and over again. I recommend this highly in the genre of comedy, alongside films like Rushmore, which had a similar effect on me.",The Big Lebowski

660,Spaceballs,Great movie,10,4 July 2002,"If the movie were a car it would be a finely crafted Rolls-Royce. More technically it is a very efficient film: I couldn't identify a single boring or irrelevant minute. The casting is superb: Jeff Bridges down-at-heels bum is in perfect contrast to John Goodman's up-tight Vietnam veteran with Steve Buscemi perfectly in between. The constellation colourful and entertaining characters is another feature of the film: the Dude's wierd landlord (into strange amateur dance routines), the militant feminist played by Juliana Moore, the sycophantic personal assistant played by whatshisname Hoffman (played George in Scent of a woman, the gang of nihilists, the porn king, the bimbo kidnapee and - topping them all - the sexually perverted bowler player called (blasphemically) Jesus. If these characters didn't even interact - I mean if there was not plot at all to the movie - it would still be fun to watch them from hours on end just doing everyday things.As it is the plot is rather good. Most importantly at the end of the film it becomes known that the Dude will become a father. This is good news because it creates a good foundation for a sequel (the ""Little Lebowski"", perhaps). The characters and humour of this film are so brilliant that it would be a sad waste if they were confined to just one film.",The Big Lebowski
661,moviejam,"F*ck it Dude, let's go bowling.",10,20 March 2003,"What to say about this film that hasn't already been guessed at?? The story comes in and out of a period in Jeffrey Lebowski's (The Dude) life and shows the ease with which he gets himself into ridiculous situations.I gave this film 10 out of 10 (one of only 3 films to score this out of about 600 I've rated - take note all you people out there giving Daredevil etc 10 points!)The editing is superb, the lighting and use of colours is unlike anything I've ever seen. Examples include the darkness which falls at the scene of a disasterous event outside the bowling alley in the second half. Another is the jump cut to an exploding firework used when The Dude is punched whilst lying on his new rug. The trails of light from the firework then morph seamlessly into an aeriel view of the lights on the streets of LA at night. Amazing stuff.Visuals are great, but when not backed up with equally good dialogue you can end up with a George Lucas movie. The dialogue in this film is at times nothing short of astonishing. John Goodman's character, Walter, is a Vietnam veteran with excellent vocabulary, historical awareness, philosophical ability; all shot through with tirades of foul language. He is both hilarious and thought provoking, much like the film as a whole.With a supporting cast of John Turturro, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi, David Huddleston, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Peter Stormare and Tara Reid; the movie shimmers with comic timing and great acting.It's one of the best.

666,TIDQ,The greatest movie ever made about a rug,9,10 October 2004,"From the infamous Coen brothers, comes a movie so fresh and original that one must wonder what they were thinking when the concept for this film sparked.The Big Lebowski revolves around the simple-looking yet wonderfully-acted character of ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), and due to a case of mistaken identity with another Jeffrey Lebowski, he becomes swept up in the story of family deception.The story if the movie seems to be about extortion and conspiracy and kidnapping, but the reality of the movie exists on two different levels. There is the overly dramatic suspense story, and then there is the story of a deadbeat who just wants his rug back and to remove himself from all the confusion. The brilliance is that the movie treats the Dude's plight as the more important story, in the same process making a parody of the big story within the movie and a parody of dramatic plots in general. Everyone, even the Dude's best friend Wally, starts moving on this upper wavelength, and the Dude is the only one who brings the viewer back down to Earth.The Dude himself is merely a complete loser, albeit one whose charisma has earned him a crown of respect among his own lower tier. He is swept up in the flow of this big conspiracy against his will and gets taken for a brutal ride, he gets beaten up, attacked by a marmet, has his rug peed on, and receives repeated abuses to his car, along with other things. The kidnapping plot becomes confusing and hard to follow, but it's not necessary to understand totally. The real treasure of the movie is watching the Dude's reactions to all the convoluted things happening around him.The juxtaposition of the over-the-top drama of most of the characters and the simple-mindedness of a man who spends the entire movie in his pajamas and with a White Russian in his hand provides for countless memorable scenes and quotable dialogue. The movie is at its roots, always a comedy, but a smart one. Its downfall is that it has more ""highly amusing"" moments than it does ""laugh out loud"" moments.Still, what it lacks in cheap laughs, it makes up for in beautiful cinematography. The musical score, the camera angles in the bowling alley especially, and most of all, the dream sequences that have to be seen for words cannot do them justice.Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore, and John Goodman all give fantastic performances. The characters are fun and memorable, and there's not much I can do else to describe the movie. Everyone owes it to themselves to see this movie at least once just to experience its unique taste.",The Big Lebowski

He is mistaken for the millionaire Jeff Lebowksi, who owes a lot of debt, by two angry mobsters and they.....well ruin his favorite rug shall we say. He goes to the paralyzed millionaire for retribution for his rug only to become even tangled up in a kidnapping plot, which involves a severed pinky toe, threats of castration, and the death of a car (as the Dude puts it). He enlists the help of his crazy, paranoid, Vietnam veteran, Walter (played by Goodman), who converted to Judiasm also, to help him out figure out all the chaos going on.The film is for people with a weird sense of humor. This is not your typical Hollywood comedy by any sense of the imagination. And this does have some pretty rough language in it, with the f-word being said 251 times. Recommended for fans of Monty Python and definitely a must see for fans of the Coens brothers as well as Jeff Bridges.",The Big Lebowski
670,femkesratings,The Movie to End All Other Movies,10,27 October 2019,"This my absolute favourite film of all time. I love most of the Coen brothers' work, but this is their masterpiece. I love films that have a strong sociopolitical message but are not melodramatic and instead bring it in a more fun or subtle way. This film delivers great commentary in promoting pacifism and nihilism, but at the same time it's a hilarious comedy, and a parody of the neo-noir genre (even the title itself is a nod to neo-noir, referring to the 1946 noir classic ""The Big Sleep""). And most importantly, it does all those things perfectly.""The Big Lebowski"" is a film about nothing, but that's kind of the point. Like in film noir, the plot is overcomplicated. Even the Coen brothers themselves have admitted to not even being able to entirely follow it. It's about the journey, man. The crime in this case is very ironic and satirical. Our 'detective' is a slacker who calls himself ""The Dude"" and spends his days bowling and smoking weed. Our crime is that said Dude is the victim of theft: his rug has been micturated upon and stolen. And that makes The Dude very upset, because it really tied his room together. Much potential for comedy in that plot, and the script more than delivers. Almost every line in the film is laugh-out-loud funny and the actors in the film all have brilliant comedic timing. Superb casting.In this film, the Coen brothers seriously criticise the war. The Dude's sidekick, Walter, is a Vietnam war veteran and look what it did to him. The poor guy is seriously disturbed. It is even mentioned that The Dude's disabled name double, Jeffrey Lebowski, is in a wheelchair because of the war.
The film also conveys the message that money doesn't buy happiness (which is a theme the Coen brothers have played with in most of their films). Almost all the characters (even the self-proclaimed 'nihilists') are after money and nothing good comes of it in the end.
In the end, the Coen brothers are promoting The Dude's pacifist and abstemious lifestyle.""The Big Lebowski"" is a perfect film that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good comedy. Everything in this film stands out, from the acting to the writing to the music to Roger Deakins' fantastic cinematography (those dream sequences!). 10/10",The Big Lebowski

This movie is one of the funniest films I have ever seen. Everything is just so on in this picture.  Jeff Bridges is gold as ""The Dude"", but it's John Goodman, in my mind, that steals the show. Walter is one of the funniest characters I have ever seen.  I can't remember laughing as hard as I did when he pulled the piece in the bowling alley or when they go to the kid's house about the stolen money.  Plus, every time he tells Steve Buscemi to shut up...it just gets funnier.Also, John Tuturro as Jesus was great.  I just wish he would have had more screen time.

Rarely have I seen movies that impact me the way this movie did.  I was really impressed with every aspect of the movie.  Some have enjoyed Fargo better then The Big L. but I don't think so.  I know that the Coen brothers set out to make a movie like no other and I feel like they have.  The movie didn't make me fall off my seat with laughter until I really thought about it for several days.  It took several viewings of the movie to catch everything that was going on.  I had to purchase a video so I could save money at the video store!  Each viewing revealed yet another detail that was missed previously.  It's not everyday that you find a comedy that really makes you think as well as laugh.

676,Duderino-2,A masterpiece,10,6 April 1999,"Some critics didn't like this movie, accusing it of ""being inconsistent"", of ""having no plot"" and of ""talking about nothing"". I think they are the sort of people that praised pathetic, boring movies like The Thin Red Line or Spielberg's latest epic. Lebowski is the best Coen movie ever. In a plot that is essentially a bizarre version of The Big Sleep, the Coens throw in some amazing characters like the L.A. slacker ""Dude"", the half-crazy Vietnam veteran, the Dude's pathetic landlord, Jesus, the ""Nihilists"" and the result is absolutely brilliant. The heroes (or should I say idiots) of the movie have the unique ability to screw up everything they are trying to do, from a simple investigation to the shaking of Donny's ashes in the end. The surreal dream sequences demonstrate the Coen brothers' virtuosity. I laughed from the beginning to the end of the movie. Lebowski is one of the funniest and most original movies of the decade. Ten out of ten.",The Big Lebowski
677,wildjest,This Movie Is the Best!!!!!!,10,10 March 1999,"This movie is my fav. movie in the world!!!! It may be pointless, but it's great and in my opinion reflects life, if you look closely.

678,Ben-162,I was talking about my rug...,10,26 January 2000,"I'm going to be daring.  I shall court with controversy.  I have a terrible feeling that I will not escape with my artistic integrity (such as it is) intact.  The Big Lebowski is the Coens finest achievement.  There.  I've said it - and will now wait for the inevitable aftermath.  But Why? 
The Lebowski is, and always will be, a sublimely irrelivent film of the most absurd and brilliant kind.  It allows a perfectly cast Bridges, with a similarly brilliant Goodman, to expose the characters in full.  The Dude, one of the most enduring and sypathetic characters in film history,  becomes involved with a series of events that lead him to the dark under world (strangly enough, for a guy who just wants his rug) of the porn industry. This quest for the rug is aided and (mostly) abeited by Walter in a series of intermingled story lines that are started, concluded, but mostly just forgotten about by the Dude in the Coen's superlative writing. 
The Dudes goals, as with the films pretentions, are modest enough:  All the Dude ever wanted was his rug back, and the Coens simply show that life, is life - involving both ""strikes and gutters.""  A special mention has to be made for John Tuttorro, the explosive Jesus (with a record) who, in a few minutes of screen time makes an impression comparable to Brando in Apocalypse Now(almost).  Combined with the brilliant music, beautiful cinematography and the Weirdest acid flashbacks you've ever seen, this films a winner.  Did I mention it really tied the room together?",The Big Lebowski
679,nick69,Cohen Brothers,10,18 October 1999,The more I watch this movie the more I enjoy it.  That is a statement that can be made for almost all of the Cohen brother's films.  John Goodman gives his best performance ever.  The over the top performance by Philip Seymour Hoffman was right on and overlooked.  This guy always steals the scene no matter what movie he's in.  (Except Twister which no one could have saved.) When I first heard Jeff Bridges was doing a Cohen brothers film I was kind of surprised but he did a good and convincing job as the Dude.  A give this film a 9.  By the way I got in an argument with my friend over the Cohens. Here is how I rank their films.1. Miller's Crossing 2. Fargo 3. Raising Arizona 4. Blood Simple 5. Big Lebowski 6. Barton Fink 7. Hudsucker ProxyMy friend ranks Hudsucker higher.  I love the Cohen brothers but this was a disappointment.,The Big Lebowski
680,STEVEN_SEAL,damn funny film!!!,8,11 June 2001,What can i say about this film. ive recently watched it on video. ive watched fargo and that was the main reason why i purchased this movie. i thought the coen brothers have a gift and wondered if this same gift is used in this movie. in my opinion this is probably better than fargo. steve buscemi and john goodman are absolutely hilarious in this movie. especialy when donnie says one word in a conversation with a quick reply of 'shut the f##k up donnie' from goodman. but lets not take any thing away from jeff bridges who as the 'dude' is so good at being so chilled makes me laugh. the dream sequences made me crack up as well with jeff or the 'dude' doing his little dance down those huge steps. all in all a pleasure to watch one of my top 10 movies.

681,alysiakoloamatangi,"This is just, like, my opinion, man",9,10 January 2020,"At first glance, The Big Lebowski appears to be a film about a man seeking compensation for a soiled rug. For that reason, I delayed watching it for years, anticipating that it would be difficult viewing.In actuality, The Big Lebowski is a pleasure to watch. This is largely because it allows the audience to inhabit the headspace of the Dude, who moves through life unperturbed by external events and material losses. In seeing the world from the Dude's perspective, the viewer is encouraged to avoid getting caught up in the frustrations of daily life and instead cultivate inner contentment, or at least a more laid back attitude. In some ways, the film is disorienting because of the many repetitions in dialogue and setting. I believe this is a conscious choice by the Coens, intended to bring the audience further into alignment with the Dude by emulating the echoes and flashbacks that would be rife in the mind of a 48 year old stoner.Some critics suggest that in seeking compensation for his rug, the Dude is expressing a latent desire for order and meaning. I disagree with this interpretation. The Dude's uncharacteristic attachment to the rug is what embroils him in a string of calamitous events that test his equanimity. In my view, this is intended to convey that suffering is caused by attachment to material objects. The Coen brothers have rejected the notion that the film is conveying any particular message, so there is no definitive answer here.This film inspired me to try my first White Russian (or as it is jokingly called in the film, a Caucasian) the following day. Unfortunately, I had an allergic reaction to the beverage and fainted in my driveway before being taken to hospital. I will therefore always have a strong sense memory associated with The Big Lebowski.MVP: Jeff Bridges as pyjamaed hero.MVQ: ""Smokey this is not 'Nam, this is bowling.

Jeff Bridges character is one that could not have been played better by anyone - this is one of those roles that seems so perfect, so real, that it will forever define the actor who played it. Jeff Bridges will always be ""The Dude"".I also loved the roles that John Goodman and Steve Buscemi played. Goodman's manic Vietnam vet is hilariously earnest, and Buscemi has an uncharacteristically quiet role, which is put to great comedic effect in relation to Goodman. One of the little things I like so much about this movie is the portrayal of the friendship between the three characters. It feels completely natural, which may say a lot about me and my friends. I love this aspect of the movie.The dialog is superb, and there are many throw away lines that you may miss if you've only seen it once.

I've seen Lebowski at least a dozen time and most of the times by accident. It was on TV or a friend is watching it and it is enough to catch a glimpse to be hooked, completely hooked. Last night I saw it on purpose with a couple of friends and I think I'm stating to realize what is it - A unique combination of talents all looking in the same direction --- The Coen Brothers are, probably, the only ones who know what they are seeing and the rest just trust their vision. Totally. Jeff Bridges is miraculous. His character is unique, never seen and at the same times is all of Bridges characters put together. I love him in this part and I love the Coen brothers for writing it knowing, I'm sure, that Bridges was going to give it that real, totally real surreal kind of life. Philip Seymour Hoffman, comes in to do what he does best, being memorable and then, of course, John Tarturro, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, delicious, each one of them - I'm pretty sure The Big Lebowski will be around for centuries and it will always have something to say even if we don't know exactly what.",The Big Lebowski

All you have to do is take a stupid plot and mix it with some dead beat characters that yell a whole lot.  This movie should not be on the top 250 list, nor anywhere close.  You have to think when you finish watching this movie ""Why is this a great film?  What did I learn from this?"" then you will understand.  I laughed maybe twice during the whole movie.  John Goodman's character's lack of not being able to see the scale of problems is not funny at all, more irritating than anything else.  It's hard to sit through 2 hours of listening to him spit out the ""genius comedy"" lines that people on here keep raving about.  These lines are not more that phrases that literally don't make any sense and the only reason people will think they are funny or repeat them because they have no place in any movie.  For instance, what is ""the bar eats you"" line?  Now some of you can overanalyze this into making some sense but I am sure that it was written to be just another stupid line that was said with hopes of being overanalyzed into something that made sense.  Don't believe the reviews on this page, you really shouldn't waste your time with this one.

Well Barton fink was odd but still not bad. Jeff Bridges is The Dude, literally. I find it very strange that the hero of this story is a loafer who just wants to drink White Russians, get stoned, and bowl, but it works a treat. I found myself getting caught up in their world. John goodman played a great role as The Dude's friend Walter and Steve Buscemi filled the part of poor old Donny. The story is humorous throughout although brief sadness is found, but even this is used to humorous effect. Okay it isn't one of the most intricately woven plots ever but the dialogue is expertly written and the characters superb. I recommend this film to anyone who is a Coen brother's fan (that really goes without saying) and anyone who sees a bit of The Dude in themselves (which, if we were honest might be a lot of us) oh, and anyone who likes cool movies.",The Big Lebowski

Of course those who say it haven't seen The Big Lebowski or they would have furiously denied ever having said such rot. Apparently Cohen brothers don't believe in making a movie with a reason behind it, or within it. What's more apparent is that they also don't believe in making movies with any storyline, plot devise, characterization or a rudimentary sense of storytelling. So in this respect The Big Lebowski can be held as one of their crowning achievements.There is nothing much to say except that even your best of pals are not to be trusted these days- the guy I spoke about in the first line just called me and hearing that I have forgiven him for his sin, he has agreed to come over for a drink.

The greatest thing about this film is the characters that are created.  The Dude (Jeff Bridges) is one of the all-time great film creations. Walter (John Goodman), standing in stark contrast to the Dude's pacifism, is similarly brilliant. Steve Buscemi is funny in a minimalistic role as Donny, who is always one sentence behind everyone else. The Stranger (Sam Elliott) is a classic narrator, completely unrelated to the plot. Other unnecessary characters include the unnervingly funny Jesus (John Turturro) and the painfully awkward landlord Marty (one of the underappreciated moments in the film is his dance routine). Honestly, would the plot really be affected if the stranger, Donny, Jesus, Marty, Brandt, or Knox Harrington weren't in the film. What about the private detective at the end, or the fascist policeman. The plot need not be understood to enjoy the comedy gold of this film.

I'll also mention that I live by dry sarcasm and underlying suggestion.Interestingly enough, I hated this movie the first time I saw it. Missing the first 10 minutes certainly didn't help, as I had a hard time following. However, nothing really stood out that I enjoyed.As I watched the movie ~25 more times over the next 10 years, I saw everything that I had missed in that first viewing. And it became entirely clear to me the pure genius and wit that goes into EVERY scene and EVERY line of dialog.This movie has the best character definition I've ever seen. Even though you can't necessarily identify with the characters, you feel as if you've known them for years within the first couple minutes of meeting them. Sure, they are stereotypical, but they are also brilliantly acted and portrayed, making them so believable.Goodman gives the performance of a lifetime. Walter is so over-the-top ridiculous, and yet so surprisingly content as such, one can't help but to laugh at how seriously he takes himself.And then there's Jesus. Everyone else does a top-notch job, but he steals the show. Two scenes, both equally outrageous. Costumed, acted and written to perfection.If you find yourself disliking this movie, watch it again (unless you're easily offended by the *F* word). Let every line of dialog sink in, along with the way it's delivered. When you find yourself laughing hard at your favorite parts, rewind them and listen to the reactions of characters that you may have missed because you were laughing so hard. They are equally as rewarding.There is so much to digest in the Big Lebowski, it deserves to be viewed a couple times a year.

Steve Buscemi plays a timid 'Donnie', constantly under the thumb of the domineering, Vietnam obsessed 'Walter' (Goodman). Whilst it is hard to pick an outstanding performance...John Goodman is stellar, consistently funny...but watch out for Jesus. Also, Flea has a brief cameo.

698,webviking6,"Can't abide the Dude,",3,27 January 2007,"I finally broke down and bought this movie because of all the glowing reviews I'd read here about it. Surely a movie so many people liked and waxed lyrical about would be worth owning. The first time I watched it, I got to the dude's second encounter with Maude and turned it off just annoyed by the film. I watched it again and made it through to the end a few days later.I've only seen three Coen brother films, Raising Arizona (mostly hated it), Fargo (mostly loved it) and this one (still trying to decide). One thing you can say about the Coen brother's films is that they are complex. This one is somewhat of an homage to Raymond Chandler's LA based Philip Marlowe mysteries. I happen to love Raymand Chandler's works and consider him one of the most brilliant authors of the 20th century, so am somewhat disappointed by the Coen brother's thievery (their characterization, not mine) of his style.The Dude, like Chandler's Marlowe get's caught up in a web of intrigue and runs around LA meeting mostly unsavory characters that you can't begin to like. Marlowe himself is somewhat unlikeable, but not as unlikeable as the Dude. At least Marlowe is working while the Dude is motivated by primarily his own greed, first in wanting to obtain a new carpet for free, and secondly by increasing offers of money from the other Lebowski and the other Lebowski's daughter Maude.But if the Dude is unlikeable, most of the other characters are even less likable. John Goodman as Walter, is especially annoying, and most of his scenes are played out so over the top to be totally unbelievable. Most of the other reviewers talk about how ""realistic"" the conversations between Walter and the Dude are, yet gullibly laugh at Walter throwing himself out of a moving car with an Uzi wrapped in bubble wrap to go try to catch a kidnapper to beat the truth out of.Donnie is probably the most likable of the three friends, or at least maybe you feel most sorry for, as he is continually told to shut up by Walter. At least Donnie gets one of the most memorable lines of the movie when the Dude and Walter are talking about something that Lenin said and Donnie interjects, ""I am the Walrus?"" Of course the Coen brothers for no discernible reason kill Donnie off at the end of the movie.I don't know why the Coen brothers felt they needed Sam Elliot in this movie, but I liked it as a nice touch of surrealism. I didn't like the dream sequences very much, especially the second one. I also found the German nihilists very insultingly portrayed, kind of along the same lines as how the Germans in Hogans Heroes were portrayed. I'd expect better from the Coen's they are smarter than that.The film wasn't totally worthless, I did laugh out loud at points (the In and Out Burger fixation was hilarious, as was the 2X4 nailed to the floor as a doorstop that the Dude later trips over, for a couple of examples), but there were as many things that I found just downright annoying about the film as well.Far from a masterpiece, it's a badly flawed, albeit, amusing film.",The Big Lebowski

701,PaulaMary,just did not care...,4,19 May 2007,"I love the Cohen Brothers. I've seen most of their movies way more than once. This one.. barely made it through once.All the characters were horrible! I wanted to reach into the movie and clunk ""The Dude"" in the head. John Goodman's character was unspeakably rude and stupid and offensive. What a waste of Steve Buschemi! The only part that was amusing was Julianna Moore's character-- mostly because she was doing a great impression of Katherine Hepburn. Now that I think of it, the dream sequences were surreal enough to be interesting, especially the bit with a POV of the inside of a bowling ball! My friend who recommended it replied to my objections by saying, ""Oh, maybe I forgot to mention that this is a movie best watched stoned."" Yeah... maybe. Do yourself a favor. Skip this one and watch Miller's Crossing again!",The Big Lebowski
702,roneBOFH,"dear fans of ""the big lebowski"": what the hell, over?",3,31 December 2007,"This movie is not funny, it is not memorable, and it is not enjoyable. It's a story that reads like it was written by some pinhead with ADD who heavily self-medicates with marijuana; a ridiculous amount of random things happened for no damn discernible reason or even a more than tenuous connection between them. I am a charter member of the Jeff Bridges Fan Club and the way he was wasted was nearly criminal, and the same goes for Steve Buscemi. The movie needed a lot less John Goodman and a lot more John Turturro. It feels like some film student decided to ape the Coen brothers. If i hadn't rented this movie for free with a coupon, i would feel totally ripped off. Something about the movie made me dodge it when it came out, and all the years since, but i finally decided to fill in a gap in my Coen brothers movie track, and now i'm sorry. I blame all of you jerks.",The Big Lebowski
703,CForeman,Hilarious,9,6 January 1999,"A lot of critics seemed disappointed with this follow-up to ""Fargo,"" but I don't see any justification.  ""Lebowski"" is easily the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.  I saw it 3 times in the theaters.  John Goodman should receive a nomination for best supporting actor for his portrayal of a bowling-crazed Vietnam Vet.  Jeff Bridges is also great as ""The Dude.""  The only ""problem"" with the script is that it must be too intellectual for popular culture.  I assume that's where the movie flew over the heads of many viewers.",The Big Lebowski

All summed up when Goodman, looking very unimpressed, turns to the dude and says: ""eight years old Dude, eight years old!""",The Big Lebowski

I expected a lot from this movie but was somewhat disapointed. The plot was harder to follow than their other movies, and after seeing it twice it still seems kinda stupid. There were too many groups working against and with each other to really pull the end together smoothly. I think there was a lot of great acting, but it didn't really help the movie. But I think they are coming out with a new movie soon, so maybe it will turn out better...",The Big Lebowski
706,jester-45,"A strange, but very funny movie.",8,30 June 1999,"This movie is great!!!  This movie is about ""Dude"" Lebowski and his friends, who unwittingly get involved in a kidnapping plot.First, lets talk about ""The Dude"".  This man is possibly the laziest sucker alive.  He dresses shabbily and lives in a run-down apartment, but that's okay with him.  The only things he cares about is getting high, drunk, or going bowling.  Until his apartment is broken into by thugs who rough him up and p**s on his rug because they mistake him for someone else with the same last name.This dosen't sit well with ""The Dude""; that rug is possibly the most valuble thing he owns.  So he goes looking for ""The Big Lebowski"" in hopes of getting some reimbursment for the rug.  He ends up getting involved in a kidnapping plot involving Lebowski's wife.This isn't your typical comedy; it isn't filled with sight gags or slapstick comedy (although there is some of that).  The humor in this movie concerns the attitudes of the characters.  On opposite sides of the spectrum are The Dude, who is totally laid-back and easy going.  To his friend Walter, who blows up over everything.  This movie also has some subtle jokes you might miss if you aren't paying attention.Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi all give great performances in this movie.  Definitely a modern classic.",The Big Lebowski

Personnally I find nothing amusing about slapstick comedy, the beauty of Lebowski(and all genuinly funny films, Dr Strangelove, Withnail and I, Annie Hall)is that it uses well crafted characters, intelligence and/or stupidity for reaching the child within. Lines such as ""she's gotta feed the monkey"" are just so off the wall that it never fails raise giggles, smirks and riotous rolling on the floor. The Dude and Walter are one of the best double acts I've ever witnessed, up there with Lemon and Curtis in Some like it Hot or Laural and Hardy. While critics are afraid to praise new films and rank them with the so called classics, I believe the Coen's will be remembered for this as well as Fargo, the same way that Orson Welles is remembered for Citizen Kane AND THEN Touch of Evil. Fargo AND THEN The Big Lebowski(which is much better!!)",The Big Lebowski
710,mjs3p,"If you will it dude, such a great movie is no dream",10,5 July 2000,"Since I saw The Big Lebowski for the first time in the movie theaters over two years ago (I saw it twice in the theaters), I have probably watched it between 50-75 times.  I was awed by the overall atmosphere the movie conveyed upon first viewing, and was shocked that every subsequent time I saw it, it just got better and better.  Even to this today, I notice something new and different upon each viewing.Critics who complain that the movie doesn't have a plot miss the point. First of all, there is a plot, albeit a wacky and zany one (a Coen Brother's trademark), that many people may not fully understand on first viewing. Second, the plot is only there to serve as a background for the amazing characters, scenes, and dialogue that the movie focuses on.   The interplay between `The Dude' & `Walter' is absolutely hysterical.  Just one example that comes to mind (I could've picked just about any bowling scene)  is Walter commenting on the Gulf War, comparing `the man in the black pagamas' to the current adversary, `a bunch of f**eaters where towels on their heads, trying to find reserve on a Russian tank' while The Dude is painting his nails.I could go on and on about my favorite scenes, but I'd just have to recite the entire movie, because every single scene is so exceptional.  From the repeated dialogue (`this aggression will not stand', `chinamen', `Pilar'), to the incredible fadeouts and transitions (`that wasn't here toe, dude'), you really have to see it multiple times to understand just how incredibly well-crafted this movie really is.In my mind, The Big Lebowski is the best of the Coen Bros.' movies, outdistancing Barton Fink.  That is an enormous compliment, because I love all their movies.  It is also possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen, and holds a spot in my top ten movies of all time.Arthur Digby Sellers!!!",The Big Lebowski

You cannot really categorize it in a particular genre!  It is unique, it is funny, the performances are outstanding and the story line is very original.  The best thing about the story itself is its simplicity (for the lack of a better word).  This movie does not try to teach us, or get a point across, it is just about dude's life who enjoys doing nothing.  Now the Coens took dude's life and turned it to one of the funniest, wittiest and most amusing movie of all times.  The soundtrack complements the story very well (the Coens always seem to have the perfect touch for their soundtrack choice) and Sam Elliot's voice for the narration was the perfect choice. That being said I just have to watch the movie again.....",The Big Lebowski

Take your typical noir tale of kidnapping, double-crossing and sleazy pornographers, and throw in 'The Dude', a pot smoking pacifist with a penchant for Creedance and white Russians.Without going into the plot, it's an amazing achievement that The Coen brothers have weaved an incredibly intricate film noir story into a bright and colorful comedy with each character funnier and more outlandish than the next.With a fantastic soundtrack, beautiful visual style, a first-rate cast and a tonne of laughs, 'The Big Lebowski' is not only a great film, it happens to be this reviewers favorite Coen brothers outing to date.It's more than noir. it's more than comedy.

My friend asked me to watch this sickening movie and I agreed, after hearing similarly rave reviews from my friends. What an utter waste of time this was! A few bums wandering around suburbia, getting themselves into nonsensical situations and uttering obscenities every minute or so. If anything, this is a sad reflection of meaningless suburban existence (what's with the obsession over bowling??!). Like one reviewer said, this movie left me with nothing--no feelings of warmth, poignancy or encouragement. Sure, there were some brilliant camera shots (a handful), but not enough to sustain a movie. The dream sequences were just bizarre...like something a stoned artist would dream up. Again, the setting of the movie (boring suburbia) did not help bolster my interest level. Dear me, there were times when I felt like stepping into the movie and bazooka-ing all the characters just so it would end! I was unmoved by the movie and completely bored out of my wits. 2 out of 4 of my friends left half-way through the movie (wisely enough). The series of 'revelations' (oooh! aaah!) at the end were trite and unsatisfying. We all have our own opinions on this movie, but please, and 8.0 is way more than what this stinking mess deserves! Movies like this are the result of a culture that has become so saturated with material wealth, prosthetic 'beauty' and glamour that triteness and meaninglessness (along with gratuitous violence and obscenity) become glamorized.",The Big Lebowski

Never have I seen so many characters involved in one plot so well, and all because of a rug! (well, partially). Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi give a magnificent performance, and their friendship on screen as a group of guys doing nothing but bowl and drink beer is one to admire. ""The Dude"" is probably one of the coolest characters ever created, but to be fair, everyones character has been remarkably developed.This movie is hilarious and if you are looking for something ""chilled"" and funny then this is it dude!Rating  -5 out of 5-",The Big Lebowski
716,emessiah,this aggression will not stand,9,30 June 2001,"i'm bored and going to spoil many things, so if you've never seen this movie skip past this review. now.to me, the big lebowski is a scathing social commentary on a few types of burnouts prevalent in the 90s.  now while the typical definition of a burnout is drug related, i would argue that the core trio of this movie (dude, walter, and donnie) are all burned out on life in their own unique ways.  the dude is rather obvious, seeing as he chooses to smoke roaches and drink white russians throughout the whole movie. furthermore, i presume him to be a weed dealer, due to his neverending supply of pot, kahlua, and money.  walter feels that society has been indebted to him for his service in nam, so his irrational righteousness carries him through the story with an award winning swagger.  donnie is the awkward outsider, trying to enter the dialogues too late thanks to his innate timidity.  while these guys seem like an unlikely trio, leave it to the coen brothers to combine them in a rather dysfunctional faction to show the utter pointless absurdity of their lives.from there, the movie centers around the inherent human trait to recycle things that it comes across.  the conversations are circular, the characters all develop vernacular influenced by others, and the most boring conversations turn into a slapstick gag by the rather simple method of immediate repetition.  the coen brothers are masters of characterization (i wanted to slug that pregnant cop in fargo for her accent alone) so it's interesting to watch the characters develop throughout the course of the big lebowski.  you generally don't get a one dimensional look at any character in their movies.the subtlties of the coen bros' movies are what make them borderline genius, and the big lebowski is saturated with all kinds of hilarious quirks that are easy to miss.  check out jesus' coke fingernail on his pinky, or how the cops raid the bowling alley after the gun scene, while walter's borrowed dog runs off (yet inexplicably shows up later).  or even the irony of how the self-proclaimed nihilists are so worked up over getting the money that they don't fit their title, subtly pointing to the core trio as the true nihilists in the movie.  the dude only smokes roaches except when he's in the lap of luxury at the big lebowski's place, where he lights up a spliff. even the middle/upper class work ethic is chastised when the dude shrugs in utter disbelief that he's getting completely discredited because he doesn't have a formal job.  i wouldn't be surprised if these characters were based on people from the coen brothers' past, seeing as they probably were ridiculed as aspiring directors many years ago, and maybe even got told to get a real job on several occasions.i think this movie is their masterstroke, although the hudsucker proxy is indeed wicked too.  most everything is perfectly implemented in this movie, and consequently utterly hilarious.  this whole adventure starts with someone, uh... soiling the dude's rug and ends with the dude getting the most wicked 5 o'clock shadow ever, in between lies the most hilarious social commentary i've seen.however, this movie is COMPLETELY hit or miss.  some people are going to call it incoherent and boring, others like myself will call it genius. either way, the coen bros' caustic sense of humor isn't for everyone. although it's a blessing if you can understand it, seeing as you're treated to the best movies that come out of america, in my humble opinion.",The Big Lebowski

Jeff Bridges plays The Dude - a seriously stoned bowler who is dragged into a web of deception when mistaken for the Big Lebowski. All the dude wants is his rug back, but he goes through a lot to get it.The main characters in this movie are all larger than life and quite insane. John Goodman, John Turturro and Julianne Moore all produce excellent performances, due in part to the excellent script. It has to be one of the most quoteable films ever.This is one film that needs to be watched a few times as the whole atmosphere is a bit incoherent, and it seems to make a little more sense with each viewing.Its worth seeing just to check out John Turturro in a purple catsuit.",The Big Lebowski

720,cory-spicer,Probably my favorite movie of all time,10,5 February 2009,"There's not much that can be said about ""The Big Lebowski"" that hasn't already been said. Not only is it a hilarious tale of mistaken identity and personal greed, but it is a landmark film in terms of style, character, and philosophy. It is on a very short list of truly essential films from the 1990's, and stands up to as many viewings as you choose to throw at it.One particular shining star is the main character, Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski, played by Jeff Bridges. A perfect embodiment of the slacker lifestyle combined with the Zen mentality, The Dude carries the picture as the unfortunate victim of external events (""All The Dude ever wanted was his rug back""). Full of hilarious lines and deadpan reactions, Bridges ensures that no scene is without insight and comedy (even Donny's ""funeral"").John Goodman is also a high point, turning in what is probably the best performance of his career as Walter Sobchak. A Vietnam vet holding a grudge against the rest of the world, Walter lends his unique form of support to The Dude. The scene with Walter substituting a ""ringer"" for the ransom money is one of the greatest few minutes of film I have ever seen. Goodman really dives into the character, delivering the little idiosyncrasies that lend unquestioned authenticity to the character.There are plenty of other notable performances, including Steve Buschemi as the slow-witted Donny and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the tight-assed Brandt. The Cohen brothers spun a true masterpiece with this movie, one that seems only to become better as the years pass. A must-watch for any film fan.",The Big Lebowski

John Goodman will never have a role like this again and I feel that it is his if not also Jeff Bridges' finest work. Phillip Seymore Hoffman never ceases to amaze me.

But this movie just gets better with each viewing and it is now easily one of my favorites.

After watching it, not a day goes by without me laughing about a particular scene in it. It is one of the Coen's finest movies, and definitely their most underrated. Three actors make this movie a classic: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and John Turturro. Bridges is a terrific actor who is extremely underrated (much like the film) and there is no actor who is more perfectly cast for the role of 'The Dude' than Bridges, who brings immeasurable panache to the role of, basically, a drifting stoner. Goodman, a Coen regular, is given his meatiest film role yet and he grabs it with both hands. Admittedly, he is given some terrific lines but Goodman fills Walter Sobchak with humanity as well as humour. Turturro is given the slimmest of cameos but his queer Latino bowler, Jesus Quintana, is without doubt the best cameo EVER in a movie. No question.

Clever story, developed and paced well and just so freaking funny.One of many interesting tidbits, the dudes' $.69 check at the beginning of the film is dated 9/11/91, followed by G Bush senior talking on the TV about Iraq war. The more things change....One last note, on the making of, the Cohens mention Joel Silver suggested (and they ignored) that he should get his rug back.

The story might be a little complicated to understand at first.

740,softvish,The dude knows,9,29 September 2018,"Honestly a laugh-out-loud comedy that I agree with others, does not get old! The bowling scenes crack me up. Steve Buscemi is hilarious in this and of course Jeff Bridges. There are just moments of sheer comedic cringe-worthy moments that will have you in stitches. Check it out!",The Big Lebowski
741,Big Max,Truly a cult movie,10,22 November 1999,"This movie is one of the most shallow yet so so deep movies I've ever seen. So many bizzar characters (which have nothing to do with the plot - what plot???) The plot - none exsistant, at least not a real one. John Goodman was AMAZING. Every muscle in his body yells: ""I'm Walter"" in this movie. Jeff Bridges was excellent as well, doing a great Dude, one of the best characters I've seen on screen. I watch this movie again and again, and enjoy it every time. The dreams sequences are great, the ""erotic"" bowling shots are great, and of course ""nobody fucks up with the Gesus"".10 out of 10.",The Big Lebowski
742,Kleist,The Dude Abides,10,29 September 1998,"""Somehow I rest easier, knowing the Dude is out there, takin' 'er easy for our sins."" So states the mysterious cowboy narrator of THE BIG LEBOWSKI, thereby elevating Jeff Bridges' character, The Dude, into the archetypical Christlike anti-hero of our times.Christlike? But The Dude's every other locution is the ""eff"" word!Yes, but in chaotic times like the American 1990s, the forces of decency and love inevitably must be found in some pretty strange places, podner.THE BIG LEBOWSKI is a romp whose chief goal is to make audiences laugh until they cry. However, along the way, the Great Themes all are broached: Love, Death, Greed, Perfidy, Betrayal, Forgiveness, Courage, Honesty, Ambition.I have watched LEBOWSKI merely four times, but I look forward to owning my own copy soon and watching it once a month. I've already memorized sections of dialogue. Flaubert said, ""Madame Bovary--c'est moi!""; I am inclined to say ""The Dude--c'est moi!""For those whose minds and hearts align with those of the Coen Brothers, surely this is their crowning achievement to date. No scene rings false, and the parts all cohere, even though one must watch the film several times before every detail falls into place. This is a consummate work of picaresque art which becomes a kind of DON QUIXOTE before it's over: utter compassion and realism underlie the delicious absurdities.Ye who have ears to hear: listen and laugh. This is as good as film gets at the turn of the millennium.",The Big Lebowski
743,The_Old_Man,I thought the movie stunk.,1,13 September 1998,"I thought the movie was pure crap. It wasn't worth the dollar I paid to rent it.I am a Vietnam vet, and have many friends that are the same, and I don't know anyone like the Goodman character. John Goodman plays a major screw-up , totally unbelievable that someone could be THAT stupid.The character played by Sam Elliot should be ashamed calling ""Dude"" a hero, a ""man for our times"". In the times we live in where the world is ""going to hell in a handbasket"", we need not immortalize a character who is a dope smoking, booze swilling, careless, jobless, wreck as a hero. The Coen brothers need to get out of their Hollywierd environment and get a grip on what's real in our society. The fantasy scenes with Dude flying through the air and the bowling sequence are interesting, and point out the best thing you can say about this movie - someone must have been on drugs who created it.",The Big Lebowski
744,hikulix,Dumb,6,8 July 1999,"I was very disappointed. I really liked Fargo, and so many people I know had such good comments on this film, but I find it just dumb and somewhat predictable.The characters, ""Dude"" and Walter are great, though. They are complex and interesting. Yet I find the plot...although it's complex and full of twists, ...mainly bland and forgettable. The story starts to become messy,really messy after an hour an a half, and you start getting that ""anything goes now"" feeling. And what's with Dude's constant ""trips""/dreams? They are not funny, and they only detract from the story.",The Big Lebowski
745,chimp-3,Comedy genius.,10,16 October 1998,"This is quite possibly the funniest film I've ever seen.  The more I think about it the better it gets.  There are so many classic scenes in this movie that just stick in your memory and never lose their hilarity. Jeff Bridges is stunningly good as 'The Dude', and John Goodman's performance is, as ever, brilliant.  John Turturro also appears in surely one of the most memorable and humorous cameos in cinema history as the perverted rival bowler 'Jesus'.  My only gripe is that the vast talents of Steve Buscemi were a little wasted in his relatively small role, but he still shone through as the timid 'Donny'. It is impossible to list all the great points of this film.  See it at the cinema, then rent it, then buy the video.  I know I will.",The Big Lebowski

The eccentric Dude and his bowling buddies and their antics are so hilarious I laughed for days after seeing this.  I had to replay several scenes over and  over in disbelief of how creative and funny they were.  The acid flashbacks were particularly great!

Jeff Bridges nailed the Dude character, John Goodman was great as the whacked out Vietnam vet, and the camera work kicked some serious ass!

During the film, I wondered if this was a film she could enjoy.  I do not know any female who has seen the film.  After, she told me she loved it.  I was taken aback by this comment and now I am thoroughly convinced that this is a great movie.  It would be impossible for me to give away any of the plot, considering that the plot is inexplicable. However, The Big Lebowski is a phenomenal comic mystery complete with cursing, bowling, unemployment, grand theft auto, a matter of one million dollars, and a toe...with nail polish.",The Big Lebowski
751,vorhese,My favorite movie of all time - a perfect movie,10,23 October 1999,"If there was ever a perfect movie, it would be The Big Lebowski.  The Coen Brothers outdid themselves with this story about The Dude, an average joe who grew up in the 60's, likes the leaf, and loves to bowl.  Stealing the show are John Goodman as Walter the Vietnam vet and John Turturo as ""The Jesus,"" a flamboyant Spanish pedophile.  Also making an appearance is Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers who makes a great techno-playing nihilist. But above all, there's The Dude, Jeff Bridges' most loveable character ever.To tie everything together we have the narration of The Stranger.  The best movie Ive ever seen and can watch it over and over again.",The Big Lebowski

People like that shouldn't be dignified with a response.  There's no use explaining the genuis behind this movie to someone of that caliber.  My friends and I were recently saying that this is one of the only movies where you can start it anywhere in the movie and watch it from there, there's not a dull moment to be found. Every actor is great, esp. Jeff Bridges and John Goodman.  Of course, they were overlooked for any awards.  Overall, this is the Coen brothers best work to date, and one day will get it's due.On a side note, was I the only one who noticed Jeff Bridges was wearing that same blue-sleeved baseball shirt in ""The Fisher King?""",The Big Lebowski

I, however, see The Big Lebowski as their all time greatest.They have turned a story about a guy known as ""The Dude"" into a comedy masterpiece.The Big Lebowski is rather controversial in a way that you will either love it or find it dull and boring. Either way take the time to watch it and decide for your self. I promise you that you are to find at least one of the characters in this movie extremely funny.This is also one of these movies that are worth watching several times.Warning! Do not expect mind-boddling revelations on the meaning of life from this movie. Just sit back and enjoy two hours of truly original and at times hysterical comedy.",The Big Lebowski
754,DarkObserver,"White Russian, anyone?",10,29 March 2001,"My favorite comedy of recent years. Filled with funny, quirky characters and situations as you'd expect from a Coen brothers movie, done with style. The hero -or anti-hero rather- ""The Dude"" Lebowski may not be a genius, but very likeable nonetheless. You got to love his attitude: While stumbling through a crime mystery apparently inspired by Chandler, Hammett and the like, he gets seriously drugged by a porn producer, is beaten up by a sheriff, threatened with losing his ""Johnson"", used as a sperm donor by a feminist/artist; and this list of mishaps is not even complete. But amidst all this he's able to smoke some reefers, drink a lot of White Russian cocktails -which I tried for the first time myself after seeing the film, I can recommend it- and go bowling with his friends. At the end someone even dies, but it's the character you least expected to...This is one of those rare movies, that get even better with each viewing. Two thumbs up!",The Big Lebowski
755,thepeej,A comedic Masterpiece.,10,6 June 2000,"This is by far the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.  It's also the most original and creative of the Coen Brothers' films.  If you like sarcastic humor, or flat-out violent in your-face comedy, I suggest this film.  Don't miss the hilarious scenes inside the character's local bowling alley, or John Goodman's hilarious performance, as a ""Jewish"" friend of the Dude.  My grade: 10/10",The Big Lebowski
756,ashratempel,to know the Dude is to love the Dude,10,15 July 2002,"A simply amazing film with definite cult status, I can watch this movie over and over, especially when I need to be picked up...it's one of those movies that makes you feel safe and comfortable, just because the Dude makes you feel like everything will work out fine. The movie is hilarious, and there are so many great quotes and characters. It is also one of the few films that makes me think LA might be a nice place to live. The music is excellent, the dream sequences are inspired. I enjoy most Coen brothers films, but this one is truly special. It has such a good flow to it. Often, when I really like a movie, I enjoy the first half hour or so more than the rest. This one is entertaining from start to finish. Jeff Bridges, whom I've often liked in films, has really made one of the greatest characters of all time. The Dude abides. Viva el Duderino!",The Big Lebowski
757,mrewster,At least I'm housebroken...,10,23 June 2001,"Well, I thought I was till I nearly pi**ed my pants laughing the first time I saw TBL. And the second time..and the third... One of the things that kills me about this movie, and apparently no-one else sees, is the fact that the Dude is SO laid back that he rarely has a thought of his own. Three quarters of his dialogue is only him repeating something he picked up from someone else in the film. He even catches himself almost repeating something he doesn't mean to...""And stay away from my special lad...my f***in lady friend"". Did anyone notice what he was wearing in the ""Gutterballs"" dream sequence? It's the same thing 'Carl Hungus' has on in the ""Logjammin'"" porn video. The whole plot is motivated by the Dude being influenced by everyone else (mostly Sobchak) and he just floats along with it. Not until near the end when he realizes ""My thinking about this 'case' has become very uptight"" and actually figures things out for himself, does he really guide his own destiny. I must have watched it 10 times before I caught everything, lot of ins, lot of outs, lot of what what have yous. Lot of strands in the Duder's head. The best comedy of all time, hands down.",The Big Lebowski
758,el duderino-3,"perhaps, one of the greatest comedies of all time. . .",10,17 September 2000,"a magnificently well-thought out comedy that draws its material from philosophy, politics, and bowling.  the brothers follow a seemingly apathetic character who refers to himself as ""the dude, or your dudeness, or el duderino if your not down with the whole brevity thing"" as he unwillingly becomes responsible for the life of the missing trophy-wife of a wealthy cripple who shares the same last name as the dude. . .lebowski.  rather than relying on simple fart jokes and sight gags this comedy revolves around the question of how one is expected to behave in modern american society and how one exists when one no longer considers oneself to be a member of society. the protagonist is an outsider, a contradiction to the values of the politics that surround him and our willingness to embrace him is the core of this wonderful film.",The Big Lebowski
759,ftm187,"""Marvellous.. just marvellous""",9,24 January 2001,"This is a great movie. Or you love it or you hate it. The thing with The Big Lebowski is that the whole story isn't that important. It's all about the weird characters and the conversations. Plus that it has a great soundtrack and the you get to see the nicest shots of the beautiful game of bowling (even viewed from inside of a ball).It's about this guy named the Dude(Bridges) whose real name is Lebowski , that usually hangs at the Bowling with the crazy Vietnam-veteran Walter (Goodman) who screws up everything, and the shy little guy named Donny (Buscemi!). The Dude comes home after another day of bowling and finds 2 guys in his house that are after a Lebowski, but after a little brainstorming they realize that this isn't the rich Lebowski they were looking for. Before leaving,one of the intruders, the 'Chinaman', urinates on the Dude's rug. The rug that really tied his room together. But the Dude is gonna do something about it ('This aggression will not stand, man).The next day Dude decides to go to the Lebowski they were looking for to report the incident, and to maybe get some money for a new rug. This is the beginning of a hilarious 'adventure', with very funny scenes.

760,innerproduct,You mean coitus?,10,29 May 2002,"The first Coen brothers' movie I saw was ""Fargo"" and, to be frank, I didn't enjoy it very much the first time. The experience with ""The Big Lebowski"" was more or less the same. Fortunately, I watched it a second time before I returned the DVD and... my life changed. I immediately started building my own personal Coen brothers' collection (starting with, of course, The Big Lebowski). I have easily seen this movie more than a hundred times by now. In fact, I can replay the entire movie in my head if I need to!Some general suggestions for Coen newcomers: You have to allow yourself to be transported into the ""Coens' World"" before you can fully appreciate their movies. The guys have a quirky worldview and a rather twisted sense of humour. They also have a gift for writing fast, funny, quotable dialogue.Transporting one's self to the Coens' world isn't very hard: this can be accomplished by watching, for example, The Big Lebowski about 2-3 times (say within ten days).What you will get out of this movie: Several memorable quotes which will be a source of endless amusement throughout your life. And, if you watch it often enough, you'll also end up leading a more ""relaxed"" and enjoyable life. A word of warning: Don't overdo it! Overexposure may well diminish your enjoyment of the movie. (I'd say that 20 is a safe enough number of times that you can watch this movie. And then maybe you can continue to watch once or twice a year for pretty much the rest of your life.))Everything I wish to say about this movie has already been said and been said better. (If you're already an ""achiever"", do read other users' comments, they are great!) If you were waiting for one more recommendation before you rent it, here it is: Watch it! (Hopefully you'll like it as much as I did.)",The Big Lebowski
761,spudgeek,The Dude saved my life,10,2 February 2001,"I'll try not to repeat what has been said in other reviews, but this is a special movie for me.  I had gone through a very painful breakup and I was utterly miserable for two months.  One night, I rented this movie (seeing it for the second time), I laughed my fool head off, and things got better again.  Perhaps The Dude's final line in the movie (which I won't give away) provided me with hope and perspective. This is one of those rare comedies that just keeps getting funnier every time you see it.  Jeff Bridges, who is so good at intense, brooding roles, has unbelievable comic timing here. Some criticize the plot as overly meandering, and it is.  But the film's aura is compelling, and you just want to go along for the ride.Like some other Coen Brothers films, The Big Lebowski takes the archetypes of a particular genre and spins them in an utterly unique way.  All of the staples of the film noir detective story are here:  the LA setting, the kidnapping, the aristocratic client, the easily enraged sidekick, the femme fatale, the miscreants and lowlifes who impede the progress of the case, etc.  However, the lead is not someone with  an unwavering sense of purpose as is usual, but the role is instead filled by The Dude, quite possibly the laziest person in the world.  As the expression goes, hilarity ensues. Since this is the Coen Bros., the humor is obviously not like most modern comedies in which vapid characters say and do stupid things in predictable ways.  The Big Lebowski keeps you off balance with loads of witty dialogue, plot twists, and gags that absolutely blindside you.  Seeing The Big Lebowski will make your life better.

It has elements of greatness on so many levels that are not apparent at first. The bad box office turn-outs were easily overshadowed by its popularity in rental and VHS/DVD sales, very similar to what happened to a lot of great movies, such as ""Blade Runner"".Essentially this film, in a nutshell, is about a slacker in the early nineties whom, in the first several minutes, is beaten up by two thugs in his own home, one of which soils his rug, then realizing that they kicked the proverbial 'crap' out of the wrong guy, they leave.  This slacker (Lebowski), goes on an odyssey to find the men who saturated his carpet, which ultimately gets him mixed up in a kidnapping case involving German nihilists trying to cut off his genitalia, including a late night bathroom attack by a trained attack marmot.Lots of memorable scenes, characters (Such as Jesus, the perverted bowler), and very twisted humor, some of which may be considered offensive, seeing as a scant several scenes features brief nudity.It's symbolic for society, some might say, as the Big Lebowski is a very 'achieved' man, where as, the hero, the Little Lebowski, is a foulmouthed slacker, but in the end, through confusion, the Little Lebowski turns out to have been taken advantage of.A four star comedy.",The Big Lebowski
768,kristof-vajda,Black Humour at its very blackest,9,24 November 2006,"The Big Lebowski is probably one of the best films in the category of dark comedy. The Coen brothers did a really magnificent job in all respects. Practically every aspect of the movie is flawless. The characters, the dialogues, the casting, the storyline, the settings and the plot itself. Where the main roles are concerned Jeff Bridges and John Goodman gave their best performance ever. The roles suite them so well, I doubt they will ever do better than they did here. Steve Buscemi is the only exception (he already gave his best in Fargo)Unfortunately, the Coen brothers never really recovered after the shock of making such an exquisite film and their later works are nowhere near as good. In fact I'd go as far as to say their film Intolerable Cruelty (2003) was a complete waste of effort, for maker and viewer alike.There is however one emphatic point about the Big Lebowski: it is not universal humour. To really appreciate it, one has to be familiar with the American way of life or at least have a basic understanding of US history, contemporary culture, slang and so on. For example the ambiance of the ""bowling culture"", words like ""undude"", ""bummer"", ""jay"", ""ringer"" ""His Dudeness""; Walter's (Goodman) constant struggle for people to respect his constitutional rights and the RULES etc. Overall I still have to say it is an evergreen classic, and a must see for everyone who believes they have a decent sense of humour and are not put off by a little cursing from time to time and let's face it: all the time.",The Big Lebowski

I wasn't old enough to understand this film when It came on Theater so I didn't see It. Now I had the opportunity to do. Final Results : It's a pure wonderful achievement by The Coen Brothers.The Screenplay : The story is very original,the characters live in a very confusing L.A (Maybe it's like that) and they are very wealthy and varied, ""The Dude"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""The Nihilist""... All these characters are different and when they collide it make very special situations. These situations are varied too, like the places. This is not a film with just two or three places, we can see very different places of L.A.The acting : Just one of the most hilarious performances I've ever seen. Jeff Bridges was the only one to play ""The Dude"", with his long hair and some pounds more he's unrecognizable but not his performance. And John Goodman I think gave his most memorable performance, even the small supporting roles are good too (Steve Buscemi, John Turturoo).The Directing : Coens Classic, They interesting about there characters, even there isn't a lot of close shot, the ""high states"" of ""The Dude"" are pretty good, without using a lot of special effects, like this they make the scenes more realistic, it's a comedy film not a sci-fi movie.Conclusion : A excellent comedy with great performances.And don't forget : ""The Dude"" stays up",The Big Lebowski

Tried it twice, figuring one attempt wasn't sufficient.I am not offended by vulgar language, but when it is such a major portion of the dialogue, it had better be with good reason and to great effect. Neither is the case, here.These characters are the types of people that normal people with lives pass by numerous times a day without taking any notice. There is a reason for that. Folks like that are uninspiring, dull, and generally useless to the world they inhabit. Centering a movie script on them is going to make you a dolt or a genius, depending how sycophantic your fan base is. It seems too many people checked their good judgment at the door - not only giving this movie a free pass, but pumping up the votes to the extent that this turd rates in the Top 250.

771,Jesus Quintana,Possibly the greatest comedy ever. A true gem.,10,12 November 2001,"As far as I'm concerned this is easily the very best movie the incredible Coen brothers have made to date. Comedy is one of the most difficult, demanding genres around, and in order for it to work it must be made with a professionalism that exceeds all imagination.  Now that's one of the many great things about ""The Big Lebowski"". Everything in this movie is sheer genius, every detail is right, and the timing is perfect, but it feels so laidback you hardly notice the brilliance and skill.What else can I say ? The Dude is just about the coolest main character you can possibly imagine, and he's surrounded by a hilarious troupe of supporting characters that make this film a truly worthwile event. Walter Sobchak, Donnie, the three nihilists, the Jesus, Maude, Jackie Treehorn, Brandt, Knox Harrington ... they're all hysterically funny.  Same goes for the nonsensical situations The Dude gets into. The first appereance of the Jesus, the farret scene, the toilet scene (""Where's the money Lebowski ?""), the confrontation on the parking lot, the money handover, the beach scene, and so many more wonderful moments - I'll kick myself for not mentioning them later... they can make anyone with a sense of humour howl with laughter, again and again and again.The cast is tremendous: Jeff Bridges is in my opinion one of the best American actors around and as The Dude, he finally got the chance to show what a remarkable comedian he really is. John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, John Turturro, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman... each and every one of them gives a new meaning to the word ""delicious"".In short, this movie is such a feast of wonderful dialogues, hilarious characters and unbelievably funny scenes it's already a true classic.

The Dude is some sort of a divine creature, a representative of god on earth. characters like Donny (aka shut the f*** up Donny)and Walter made me think that maybe life is not all about money, cars and clothes.

777,TDI,"sometimes there's a man, well, he's just the man for his time and place",10,21 May 2002,"Hilarious. The Coen brothers put together a comic gem involving Jeff `The Dude' Lebowski, played masterfully by Jeff Bridges, as an un-employed, white-russian sipping bum who, only wanting retribution for his soiled rug, stumbles into a kidnapping-ransom scenario that has several twists and turns. Along for the ride are Walter (John Goodman), his high-strung Vietnam veteran bowling buddy, Maude (Julianne Moore), the ultra-feminist daughter of another Jeff Lebowski (this one a millionaire, and who's wife it is that is kidnappedif this sounds a bit confusing, well, just watch the movie and it'll all make sense), a pornstar, and a group of nihilists. Oh, and John Turturro is uproarious as Jesus, Walter and Dude's bowling rival.
What makes this movie so good is not the story itself, but rather how the hapless Dude and Walter stumble around, changing allegiances and theories as to what happened to the `Big' Lebowski's wife (again, just watch the movie). The back-and-forths between Walter, the Dude, and Donny (their 3rd bowling partner) are wonderfully written and delivered. The dream sequences are great (Saddam Hussein handing out bowling shows? Priceless) and the soundtrack is excellent. This movie is a classic among college and high school guys, and I'm sure you'll realize why when you see it. All in all, a well written, acted, directed, and funny film.",The Big Lebowski

I didn't feel any connection to any of the characters, so I couldn't care less..This film could be funny when you're high on weed, but everything is funny then.If you're looking for stupid practical joke stuff, watch this.

I did not found anything funny in it, nor action, nor story, nor the way the story is told, nor the script that is horrible. This is a flat movie without any depth, the most superficial movie I have ever seen. You simply can't find any knowledge nor inspiration, nor entertainment in it. It is a great black hole, you'll only spend time watching it. There is no way to found something interesting in this movie. Except some seconds in a bowling scene, I can't find any interesting point of interest in this movie. And the hilarious part is that it was recommended to me by two friends of mine.

781,Lars-mustaine,Sometimes confusing plot saved by great characters and quality writing,10,8 November 2002,"The first Coen brothers film I saw was 'Fargo'. That was a great film, if a little short. Then I saw this. Now, when I first watched this I expected a gory, dark film like 'Fargo'. What I got surprised me. This film was quite mellow and laid back for the Coens, at least in terms of sheer, gory violence. But then the plot went off in all sorts of directions and at times became confusing but one thing remained noticable, The sheer quality of the writing and the great acting. The Dude is a warm, lovable fool who just wants to live his life and not have people mess it up. For me what made the dude such a great lead character was the quality performance from Jeff Bridges. The way in which he makes the dude appear confused but also clever is totally believeable. For me the dude was one of the most likeable heroes since Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction. As good as Bridges is as the dude one actor outshines him. John Goodman as Walter. Walter is a mentalist but also a good man and Goodman manahes to portray this with ease. IMO this is his best performance to date. Of course no film would be complete without quality dialogue and The big Lebowski has this in spades. For all the profanity there is real meaning and thought gone into the writing and it helps give character to the characters in much the same way that Glengarry Glen Ross' writing did.",The Big Lebowski

It just seemed uneven in pace and plot......however...Five days later, I found himself quoting lines from the movie and laughing to myself about many of the scenes. Call it the ""slow-burn effect"", it just gets better with age. It was a much better film than I though it was when I first saw it. However, it is a 8-9 star movie. But since I didn't realize it in the beginning while I viewed it, I had to dock it a couple of stars. Definitely part of the Cohen Canon. This is a Good Thing.

783,aforeginer,What makes this film so brilliant?,9,20 July 2017,"If someone would ever pitch this film to me in a universe where I had not seen this film, I would've probably thought of it like a small, peculiar little film, that probably would've had my interest, but with not much more going for it. Never would I have conscidered a film like that be that kind of a film I would conscider one of my personal top ten favorite films of all time. So what is it that makes it so lovable? To be honest, I didn't truly get it the first time I saw it, that can be because how young I was the first time I saw it. I have though grown very fond of it later on, for now to be conscidered one of my all time favorites, and I think it has all to do with the deliverance. The acting is great, the scenario is ridiculous and the plot is overly complicated, yet that's the reason the film works that well. I am the type of person who loves roundedness in storytelling, where conflicts are resolved in a peculiar manner. This film offers this in a sense, yet also not at all. I was very confused about the ending the first time I saw the film because there are several story lines that are never further explored as the credits roll. I didn't really like this way to end the film the first time I saw it, but I have realized over the time how brilliant it really is. First of all because of our main character, Jeffrey ""The Dude"" Lebowski. We are following his story, yet as all of our stories, it will include the story of others. Throughout the film we meet sorts of different people, whom The Dude has something to do with, we get a glimpse of their stories, but not the resolution of them, this may be because it's not something The Dude actually cares about, because the rest of those stories are not something that involves him. To quote the dude, quoting Lenin; ""You look for the person who will benefit, and, uh, you know what I'm trying to say.""",The Big Lebowski

Also wonderful performances of Bridges, Goodman and Buscemi, but among all of them, John Goodman(Walter again) raises to the top.But overall, this is an hilarious comedy, a great collection of laughs.

Perhaps partially the result of gross marketing misrepresentation. Regardless, you know how there are some films that strike such a cord that you tend to believe you can effectively use them to screen potential friends and lovers? This is such a film for me. Excellent script, generation-defining philosophy (both Boomers and Xers tend to like it the most in my experience) tempered with humor, unforgettable characters and performances exquisitely produced.

This was bad, just plain bad. The only positive comment I would have is with Turturro's character. He is the sole standout. I found myself getting very upset and hating Bridges' and Goodman's characters. If this was the directors' motivation, then they succeeded big time. I think that the actors - Buscemi, Turturro, and Hoffman - all got lulled into a false sense by the success of the directors previous film - Fargo. What a shame and bad move. The film totally misses its point of being this off-beat quirky comedy. I can't say it enough, it was painful watching Goodman's character say the same stupid line to Buscemi – over and over.

Just going' with the flow.As with so many great movies, every character is a gem, and even actors I don't normally like are excellent.When I first watched this movie, I was in a room with my extended family (wife, in-laws, my in-laws in-laws) and within 10 minutes, all but three of us had left the room, overwhelmed by the swearing and a bit disgusted with this character with no apparent redeeming features. Besides my brother-in-law and myself, my brother-in-law's 80-year old Jewish mother-in-law stayed.

Brothers, like always, in masterly way changing conventions, and all of that - accumulation of extremely funny scenes and episodes, funny and witty dialogs and loony characters - drowns in smoke of absurdity.

In the movie we can enjoy such great leading actors as Julianne Moore, Jeff Bridges (his BEST role), great characteristic actors like Steve Buscemi, John Goodman or John Turturro and also masters in supporting like Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Jeff Bridges as The Dude is kind of infinitely charismatic, so it's hard to see through to all the really fucked up stuff. He constantly repeats things that other people have said to him, he has a pretty aggressive sense of entitlement, he is a dick to women, and he only seems vaguely sane in contrast to Walter. His solution to all problems is bowling. He doesn't seem to do much of anything besides be a real chill ass dude. Which is hilarious and fun to watch. It is a great movie.

In Finland there is an exactly similar serie of films called Uuno Turhapuro. This guy is called Uuno Turhapuro and hes kind of a whacko like Lebowski. They both have unfriendly father in laws. Well in Big Lebowski the dude didnt marry Maude like Uuno who married for money and made his father in law crazy.. His father in law was a finnish minister and the wheelchair guy is filthy rich important figure. Also Uuno has two crazy and weird friends like the dude. Also the plot is always something funny and a bit nuts just like in Big Lebowski. If you like Big Lebowski or are a big fan of it I recommend the Turhapuro series for you.

Mind bending twists that are shadowed in an ""I don't care"" attitude make for some truly hilarious scenes. The energy between Jeff Bridges and John Goodman is natural, polar and just plain fun to watch. John Turtorro and Steve Buscemi also add flair to the picture in their supporting roles.

There of course is a large helping of thier special brand of humor that seems to appeal to everybody.  There is a bit of drama from movies such as Millers Crossing, and then there are the thrills that the produced in Fargo.What most people don't see is that it is a modern twist to the classic Film Nor movies.  Watch the classics -The Maltesse Falcon, Chinatown, even the Coen's own Blood Simple- and you will see how much The Big Lebowski has in common with these movies.  I think that if you took Sam Spade out of the '40s and put him in the '90s you would have Jeff Lebowski.  Other common elements the movies all contain is the wide variety of characters, the problem is never solved to the viewers satisfaction, and you can't help but feel for the detective no matter how slimey and shady he is.

TBL will stick with the viewer in mind for days and in heart for its characters (The Dude et al), dialogue, monologues, direction, originality and it's one and only story.I hope that the Coens remain in the High class because every film i have seen of theirs i have loved.

821,guliverflintesten243,Funniest movie ever made,10,4 February 2007,"I saw this movie in the late 90ties. My bigger brother, Tommy, had bought it.At first i did not think the movie was funny at all. I thought it was just a very weird film, about guys bowling. There was not any of the usual comedy, with people getting hurt and so.But at that time, The Big Lebowski being the only DVD in the House, i saw it again. Second time around it is a little funnier, but not much. Then i saw it a third time.... then it got to me.It is the funniest movie over made, period. The Characters are so funny: The Dude, Walther, The Nihilist... all are SO funny.And it gets funnier every time you watch it.The Dude lines are golden: ""Year, well, that is like, just you opinion, man"" and ""Jackie Treehorn treats objects like women, man"". And all of Walthers Jewish and Vietnam-thine is so funny every time.""The Big Lebowski"" is ""Doctor Strangelove"" of the 90ties.",The Big Lebowski
822,R_Ethier,A guy called the dude is forced from his daily routine to go on a hunt for a new rug.,9,17 November 2001,"I loved this movie, loved it.Mind you, it doesn't seem many critics liked it that much. I can think of many reasons why, one is that I have bad taste, and the other is that they are so anal that they missed the entire point of the movie.I've heard the plot sucks, well, i've watched this several times, and I have yet to even notice the plot. The plot isn't the point, this movies point is the dude.Want me to sum up the plot?-A guy called the dude is forced from his daily routine to go on a hunt for a new rug.And thats about it, thats what drives the dude. When faced with the prospect of getting several thousand dollars, he remains concerned only with his rug. Getting serveral thousand dollars might force a change in his lifestyle after all, something he tries desperatly to get back throughout the course of this movie.This movie is looked at mostly from the point of view of the dude, as such, you see the world through his eyes. A bunch of events stopping him from getting a new rug. Jeff Bridges plays the part perfectly, out of place and annoyed by everything around him taking up his bowling time.I found the entire movie hilarious in a typical over done coen way, nothing anyone says is predictable, its very well acted, well paced, and well shot (of course).Just sit back and relax, don't look to hard, and enjoy the situations the dude ends up in because everyone around him refuses to adopt his life style. Whats the moral message of the movie? I dunno, who cares?",The Big Lebowski
823,sbowen-7,Over-rated,4,20 September 2007,"I honestly really did not enjoy this movie and actually think that it is highly overrated.I am thinking of watching it again because I must have missed something, there was absolutely no storyline, acting was average; all in all I could see nothing that separates this movie from the rest despite it being bad. OK, let me not be so hard, there were some elements in the movie that were not bad and the movie did display unique traits, I guess I was simply expecting more based on the very high IMDb rating and the other comments posted. I only hope that my comment will at least level the expectations of this film so that others who view it can be satisfied customers because I for one was not. In summary I am giving this movie a 4 out of 10. As said above I do intend to watch this flick again and hope that I can see what others have seen. Anyway this is just my two cents.//Mr. Blunt",The Big Lebowski

It's a hilarious film in which you could watch it over and over thousands of times, and every time you would find something new to laugh about. This is officially my favorite movie of all times. The Coen Brothers are just magnificent. If you have not seen this movie yet, i would recommend that you rent it or buy it right away. It has a very interesting plot, and the character development is amazing. Most of the comedy in this film aren't just mindless potty humor, but instead deep funny and mature humor.

Along with Steve Martin's brilliant ""LA Story"" this stands as one of movies that captures the quirky, often times nonsensical aspects of living in Los Angeles (particularly if you live from Hollywood west towards Venice Beach). I really don't want to ruin the film by going into the plot, instead I will assure that it (A) captures the LA mystique and (B) is highly entertaining.",The Big Lebowski

827,woodylr63,a reluctant classic...,10,22 September 2005,"This film still blows me away even after about 30 viewings! It is a blend of film noir/detective film(The BIG SLEEP, Maltese Falcon/All Through the Night)/comedy. The funny thing about it is you don't even realize that it is a detective film until you've seen it 2-3 times. I was loosely aware but it really sank in after the 3rd viewing! (i'm slow, i know) ""The Dude""(Jeff Bridges)is in just about every scene, if not every scene. You get so caught up in watching him, his ""laid backness"", and his compatriots that you forget they are actually involved in trying to negotiate a ransom drop and recover a kidnap victim. ""The Dude"" is a reluctant hero along the lines of ""Rick"" from ""Casablanca"". Although not so self centered and altruistic as ""Rick"", it is evident from the start that ""The Dude"" would much rather be bowling and have a drink(a ""White Russian"", or as he called it, ""a Caucasian"") than have the responsibility of saving anyone's life.There may not be as many classic lines in this film as there are in the great films I compared it to above,but there are as many, if not more lines that get quoted by those who know and love this film.The last time I saw this(Big Lebowski) I kept asking myself what film does it remind me of the most?

The Cohen brothers are not only genius comedic writers but the way this movie is shot is brilliant as well! Point of view shots colors and slow mos of yeah! This is one of Jeff Daniels and John Goodman best rolls of all time! WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! Several times too because you end up catching a lot the second time around! The comedic timing from Steve Buschmi of my Gard! And John Tortoro as Jesus well need I mention that this is one of his best rolls as well! Everyone in the family (except for the under 14 age group because there is nudity) will enjoy this movie.

I brought and destroyed people like you before lunch time just for kicks, but that all changed. On one of my rare moments off, I managed to slow down enough to watch this film. And let me say this I am a changed man. Instead of going to work and holding meetings with people all over the world, I just walk around in my pants all day drinking White Russians and touching myself. Oh and there's some bowling involved as well. Pay close attention to my story, for we all need to slow down. Instead of working have a drink, or go bowling.

I hadn't seen it since it was in the theatres 5 1/2 years ago, and I had forgotten how great some of those lines were. So many little details, like the 69 cent check for the half and half to commiting ones ashes to the ""bosom of the Pacific"". Every Coen brothers movie before and after this one has rocked, but this one still remains the best and easily the funniest. I know that the Coen's are fond of George Clooney right now, but it would great to bring back Jeff Bridges for another role as well as John Goodman. They made a great team.

Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and John Turturro fit perfectly into their characters while a stellar cast of supporting actors (Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, Sam Elliot) give quirky and hilarious performances.  The script is possibly the best coen script to date.  I know there was a backlash when this was first released with people looking for Fargo 2 but in my opinion this is the better film. Ten out of ten in my opinion, but for those who are offended by a few hundred curse words I suggest you steer clear of this one and rent...i don't know...goldmember or something.

If you are looking for a traditional comedy this is not it . The thing that this comedy has are colorful and creative flairs unlike any another . First off , the story is about a mid-aged hippie ""the dude"" who is mistaken to be a millionaire by two goons . They claim ""the Dude"" owes them money and subsequently urinate on his rug . Later on ""The dude"" goes to the millionaire and complains about the urinated rug . This is where the story unfolds to be a fusion of hippie culture , odd personalities and funny twists - resulting to be a creative perfection . I give the Coen brothers props for creating such well thought characters and having them creatively adjust to the entourage . As for the acting , I would say that Bridges and Goodman were perfect .

It bored a lot. There is no such comedy in this movie to be called a comedy genre movie. the Walter guy is really irritable. I don't understand why is his role included as he talks senseless all the time. You cannot even laugh on what he says, even nothing special in way of talking. The same is the case with the millionaire Lebowski. He too gets irritated easily and shouts a lot. Another irritable role. Its a great sacrifice of the normal state of mind to watch this stuff. You just get up out of your mind. Standing ovation to me for watching the whole length.",The Big Lebowski

It has to be good, right?Not quite. I couldn't finish it - I had to stop watching it.In the beginning you see a resemblance in the style of this movie and a lot of Quentin Tarantino's movies. I don't know if Coen brothers are borrowing from Quentin Tarantino, or if it's the other way around, but there seems to be plenty of resemblance to this film and Tarantino's films in general.The best Coen brothers movie that they made was Fargo, and maybe it was so good because it was based on a true story. But for this, The Big Lebowski, it reeked of stupidity...but without comedy. It seemed to border on fantasy and improbability.",The Big Lebowski

Then a year later I ended up re-watching it, and liking it. Then loving it. Then I was hooked.The movie opens up with some old random dude telling us a story. He explained all about his fascination with the Dude. Then we see how the story all begins. In the middle we meet a lot of bizarre characters such as the laughing man, the fat boring kid, the nazi/analysts, and the bald guy in the little buggy.By the end of the movie you will probably dislike or be confused with the film but by the 4th time around, you wont ever understand how you could ever dislike it!",The Big Lebowski

I wont get into the plot details, since I think it's best to watch it for the first time without knowing anything about it. Then watch it again a couple weeks later. I'll bet you laugh more the second time you see it. Office Space was the only other comedy that had this affect on me. Oh and one other thing. DO NOT WATCH THE EDITED VERSION ON TV!

844,frank-edward,Awesome just awesome!,10,28 March 2012,"I would say that ""Big Lebowski"" has to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, and I have seen a LOT. There is kind of a 'circle of life' thing...in the world of L.A. slackers, everything works out, man, don't worry. Donnie dies, little Lebowski is born. Thus it continues. But you don't watch this for the message. It's got an excuse for a plot, at least: Big Lebowski's wife owes money to crooks and is kidnapped. 'The Dude' Lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire by the same name and his carpet is pi$$ed upon in a misunderstanding. Seeking compensation for the rug (which really tied the room together) he ends up commissioned to deal with the crooks. Introduce a trio of Nihilists (with marmot), a half-crazed feminist painter (Julianne Moore), a porno film industry and a gay pedophile who's extremely competitive about bowling (John Turturro) and you've got it...the ultimate stoned slacker comedy. Jeff Bridges is far out as The Dude, and hilariously understated, while John Goodman is his psychotically violent 'Nam vet best friend, who carries a piece to a bowling alley, and John Turturro is forever etched into my memory as Jesus Quintana (spoken to Walter: ""You got a date for Wednesday, baby! Whoo!"" Walter: ""...He's cracking."") Steve Buscemi was adorably pathetic as Donnie, the third wheel. One of the best quotes: Donnie: Are these the Nazis, Walter? Walter: No, Donnie, these men are Nihilists. There's nothing to be afraid of. It was very memorable, with excellent characters which is basically all that made it worth watching...the Coen's signature style doesn't come through here like it does in Fargo, and it's not overly artistic (well...in parts maybe) but it's so funny! Excellent, excellent. Especially The Dude's stoned dreams (which feature Saddam Hussein renting out bowling shoes).",The Big Lebowski

This guy introduced me to 'White Russian' ('Caucasian') cocktails - vodka, Kahlua and cream.

However, this was anything but that, I waited and waited for this movie to become funny and interesting but I got nothing but totally dull moments with no humor at all.I fell asleep after a hour or so and let me tell you that I have never ever slept so soundly while watching a movie. I don't know what happened after a hour and I'm not at all interested to know. I didn't even chuckle the entire time I was awake but finally the next day I was laughing at myself for spending money on this prosaic work and this was the only laugh I got from it.

Granted Fargo and Oh Brother are amazing, along with the rest of theirs, but considering that the age group right now for 15-28 year old males are right at home with this film. So quotable from anything Walter(Goodman) says to the liberal tomfoolery of ""The Dude""(Bridges), and they bowl all the time. this film is more than amazing.The ""Dude"" as he likes to call himself is misconstrued as a rich Lebowski in town under the same name of Jeff Lebowski, and his rug is adulterated by the ""Chinaman"". Seeking recompense for his rug, for which he claims ""ties the room together"" he approaches the Lebowski the henchmen were actually looking for. After meeting the real Lebowki, who is an old rich conservative with a young attractive wife(Tara Reid), he hires the Dude to help pay the ransom on his young wife Bunny.The plot turns into a twister of events leading The Dude on an adventure aided by his partner in crime Walter. He meets many odd, quirky characters such as Muade Lebowski, played by Julianne Moore, who delves in an Idiosyncratic sexual docket.

858,datteln,Join a Bowling League,10,13 June 2016,"I had a professor in college that used to always tell us, ""the world needs more bowling leagues."" It was a strange thing to say, I thought, in an Intro to American Politics class. This professor gave us the example of when he was in graduate school he and his wife joined a bowling league in their town. He said that it was a great way to meet new people whom you may have never otherwise thought of spending time with. He said that our society needed to relearn those social skills. After every viewing of ""The Big Lebowski"" I think back to this professor's recommendation to join a bowling league.""The Big Lebowski"" was always one of those films that was recommended to me to be included on my list of movies that I should see before I die. While I had already seen a fair number of Coen Brothers films, I was still a little hesitant to watch this one. I finally gave it a chance one rainy afternoon. I have to admit, the first time I watched it I thought to myself, ""what did I just watch?"" I laughed a lot, yes, but I couldn't wrap my head around it. As with many films I watch, I let it simmer in my brain for a while. A few months later I gave the movie a second chance. This time, at the end of the movie, I realized that I had just seen a piece of art. Every subsequent viewing I find that I like it more and more. In my opinion, it is the best performance by Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi of their entire careers. While I don't usually describe it as my all-time favorite movie, I have recently been coming back to this movie when in conversations with friends about truly great movies. I tell people to have patience with it. Don't expect to be satisfied with the ending...right away, at least. ""The Big Lebowski"" has aged extremely well, too. I feel it is even better now than when it was first released. In our era of instant gratification and social media, we need a movie like this. We need to join more bowling leagues.",The Big Lebowski
859,MarcoGallo97,One of the greatest films of the '90s,10,28 July 2017,"It is difficult to define one genre for this masterpiece:Coen Brothers combine comedy with various elements of the noir movies, such as the abundance of characters linked to each other through secret ties that reveal the rottenness behind everyone.Our protagonist is not the usual policeman or private investigator damned and alcoholic, but a complete idler,Jeffrey Lebowski(interpreted by Jeff Bridges) who will be meddled in a case of alleged kidnapping. The film is set in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, with characters well-outlined and marked by a story behind, many of which are just victims of events that live or are forced to live.The Jeffrey Lebowski characterization is gorgeous: a middle-aged lover of bowling and white Russian (this movie will make you want to drink one immediately!),in which there is a great influence of Taoist philosophy.Jeffrey abides all the events that come to him, staying calm and never getting angry.Just like a Taoist sage, he does practically nothing to change his situation. He never takes position in doing something, he always finds himself victim of the events.The protagonist is joined by Walter (played by John Goodman), representing Jeffrey's complete opposite: this character is in fact presumptuous and violent; he is angry at all (the scene where he threatens to shoot an acquaintance only because he broke a rule of Bowling is awesome) and takes the situation in hand, turning it completely.The contrast between the two is functional: like the yin and the yang, the two friends complement each other creating a balance between disorder and order, activity and passivity.Photography and direction are sublime, the only opening scene is worth more than whole films. The Coen brothers manage to focus the attention of the spectator on objects and minutia, even with mute shots and without giving much explanation. Salient points are then highlighted by the scenes in which the protagonist is out of his own (as when it is hit in the head) in which his subconscious frees up and transforms Jeffrey's desires and thoughts into true images. In the visions are actually present the bowling, carpet and daughter of the homonym Mr Lebowski dressed as a Valkyrie (surely to mark the nationality of the nihilists with whom she had to do).The soundtrack is very good for the film, so it is connected to Lebowski as much as his dressing gown and cocktails.End up finally recommending this movie to anyone: that you love the investigative films or the comedies you can not do without this movie! You can see it with your family in cheerfulness and tranquility, or have a thorough insight into the Freudian nature of visions and the well-delineated philosophy of the characters and still enjoy this masterpiece, which would definitely be seen at least once in life.",The Big Lebowski

862,bobbyjumd,the best,10,24 December 2005,"This, in my opinion, is quite possibly one of the best films of all time. With an all star cast including Steve Buscemi, Jeff Bridges, and Jon Goodman. These men were born to play these roles! They go on and on about almost anything. Very strong and well thought out characters. Turturro is another favorite of mine, portraying the character Jesus in this story. The movie flows well, and in the end it concludes that even the biggest losers in the world can make a difference. Having watched this movie over 500 times now I could go on about it for days, but this is a must see for anyone! It is my life dream to meet the dude in person, he is an actual person according to the Coens. Only the Coen brothers could make a two hour work of art on such a random series of events! amazing, 10!!!",The Big Lebowski
863,rob_aurich,"very odd movie, few like it ever written",9,30 August 2007,"This movie didn't interest me much the first time I watched, but I eventually purchased the movie on DVD. You have to really dissect this movie to understand how good it is.The characters seem random at first, but as you watch it a few times the way in which the dialogue flows becomes very funny. Credit to the writers, because the dialogue is really what makes this movie. Not much of a plot, no real ending, a silly premise - throw in a kidnapping, and that's the movie.If you're a type A personality, you might not like this movie much, but for the type B's, and further on down the alphabet, (the further the better) Great Movie!",The Big Lebowski
864,moignkhawaja,What's the fuss all about?,4,21 May 2020,A cult movie? Really? I guess it's like marmite. You hate it or love. Nothing in between. Personally for me I was recommended by some stoic saying this movie is about stoicism. Didn't get any of that. So watch it at your own peril I'd say. I'm fairly disappointed I've gotta admit.,The Big Lebowski
865,sivarttekcah,Absolutely brilliant!,10,1 June 2021,"This film is, to me, a masterpiece. The dude exemplifies what humans are lacking generally. I totally get that there are many people that don't get it, of course they don't... I assume they were hoping for a slapstick generic comedy. This has style and finesse, that is unique and makes me happy. If you do get it, you can watch it over and over, at least once a year for a top up. ... Absolutely brilliant!",The Big Lebowski
866,matijamateta,Overrated,5,18 January 2019,All folks is very excited about this movie. In asked myself if i maybe didn't get the point. For me it's just an average light comedy. Nothing special.,The Big Lebowski
867,MrMaggot,99/100 (the highest review I've given movies),10,31 August 1998,"I'm one of those sick people who actually didn't like Fargo all that much. The characters were boring, the plot was uninspired, and the sense of humor was irritating and pretentious (I guess I'm the only one that doesn't think boring dialogue about ice and snow between cops at a murder scene is laugh-out-loud hilarious).  The Big Lebowski, however, is ten times the movie Fargo is.The characters are just great.  Even minor characters get special quirks that make them far more interesting than the major characters in most recent movies.  And the protagonist, Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), is the kind of guy who wanders down to the supermarket in his bathrobe at night to write a 69 cent check for a carton of milk.  I'm tired of boring, ridiculously one-dimensional main characters who get close-ups every other second while using lines like, ""I'm not going back without my men!""  The Dude is an unlikely hero if there ever was one, and that is why he is a most refreshing and memorable one.  There's The Dude's best friend Walter (John Goodman), a well-read and impulsive Vietnam vet; Jesus, the purple -clad sex offender/bowler; Maude Lebowski(Juliane Moore), the feminist artist who speaks of ""coitus""; and a crazed group of ideologically-confused nihilists, among so many other great characters.  The dialogue is priceless.The plot is very unique and ridiculous, but it fits the movie absolutely perfectly.  The Dude and Walter get involved in a shady world of kidnapping , embezzlement, porn, reactionary cops, and just about everything else, when all the Dude ever wanted was compensation for a rug of his that had been urinated on by confused debt collectors who were looking for a different man also named Jeff Lebowski. There are so many great little touches in this movie.  The Dude's dream /blackout sequences are hilarious (complete with Saddam Hussein handing out bowling shoes and bowling combined with porn imagery).  The script is very clever  and the movie as a whole is an incredible experience.  The best part of The Big Lebowski is how strangely wonderful the whole thing is; don 't expect most moronic movie critics to understand it.  In a perfect world, The Big Lebowski would be in the AFI's Top 100 instead of Fargo.  It's the type of movie you never want to end.",The Big Lebowski
868,dbakin,"Totally excellent, man",10,23 February 1999,"This film is completely excellent.  In addition to the wonderful acting and scenes mentioned by everyone else, how about:  the landlord?  the landlord's pathetic interpretive dance?  and Walter (Goodman) showing up at the landlord's pathetic interpretive dance wearing a COAT and TIE because, by God, that's the proper thing to do - when you go to a cultural event you dress for the occasion, AM I RIGHT?And don't forget the cameo appearance by the greatest hamburger in the world:  In and Out!",The Big Lebowski
869,Brefne,"Cool, smart and very funny",10,18 November 1998,My new all-time fave flick.  A meandering plot - if you can call it  plot (a bit like being stoned and forgetting what you were going to say next - then just changing the subject completely)- but it doesn't matter!  All the characters are perfect - even though we don't see much of Turturro and Buscemi.  Jeff Bridges is superb - and looking VERY good.  The Dialogue and scenes make it a cult classic - and it didn't even make it to my local cinema!,The Big Lebowski
870,SteveJE,Plot seemed ok.....,1,2 January 1999,"What a product of modern lack of morals.  I heard this movie was funny, and it had an interesting plot.  Boy was I disappointed.  I'm not one to wince at a bit of vulgar language, but this movie had nothing but sexual references, horrible vituperation (you'd think movie writers could build up their vocabulary a bit), and on top of that progressed so slowly I think watching paint dry could have been more exciting.  I feel sorry for anyone who was entertained by this Hollywood slop.  I didn't even make it to the end of the movie, what a waste of $4.50.",The Big Lebowski
871,moviemann,Fantastic!,10,4 January 2001,"Now, I know people have complained about this film stating it was stupid and that it didn't make any sense...well, I'll speak for myself, I loved it! The Coen Bros. are the best filmakers of our time and this was no exception. Jeff Bridges was superb as the ""Dude"" and surprised me with his transformation into a slacker. John Goodman, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro(all Coen vets) put in memorable roles and made the film that much better! Watch for Jon Polito as the private detective following the ""Dude"", he was also in Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink.A word of advice, if you loved Fargo, do not expect a sequel, you'll be very disappointed. Expect the unexpected and enjoy it for what it is, a very funny comedy.",The Big Lebowski

From the very beginning when the China man pees on his rug, I knew I was in for a cracker, and I was right. The characters are excellent, the lines are sharp and funny, but best of all as the narrator claimed, it is a really cool story.This is my film of the year, yes I know it was released last year and I know its only february, but it's that good, watch it now, before I send the China man 'round to pee on your rug!",The Big Lebowski

Then I turned on the movie. As you can tell I enjoyed the movie, but had trouble seeing it considering I was recently maced.The Dude (Bridges), so he is called by his friends, is an obvious sociopath. He has little to no regard for any life especially his own. The Dude should come hang out with me and my friends so we can share some white russians.Walter (Goodman) is the best foil character for the Dude.The best part of the film was played by Buscemi. He played Donnie. Donnie will be sorely missed.",The Big Lebowski
877,peekus,One of my favorites ...all time classic to be,10,23 July 1999,"Well , when i first saw it I missed many parts or little details which made this masterpiece so much funnier , the characters introduced are so unique and original I was really impressed.. Maybe because this was my first Coen/Coen movie it hit me hard.Dude Lebowski is so lazy that at certain points he can't even think what to say so he copies what George Bush says ,or writes a check for less than a dollar..?This movie in a way makes fun of Jews , Italians , Poles , Germans ,Swedes ,Greeks , Mexicans but not in a vulgar way .I really loved the attitude 'the dude ' had when someone broke into his house smashing the door while he was smoking pot in his bathtub ...' hey this is a private apartment ..' Or the fact that he drank everyday about at least 3 white russians.Then in comes Sobczak , the dude's buddy and bowl mate .This guy is absolutely played fabulously by John Goodman . He is so fixated about rules and these  'rules' have been fought for by himself and so many other ' good guys ..in Nam ' . This fixation is so strong that at a certain point he points a gun at a bowling contestant because he went ' over the line ' but claimed otherwise .Or the fact that he argues with ' autobahn ' nihilists that ' these are not the rules  ! ...without a hostage there is no ransom '.Anyway simply the idea of introducing a character like Sobczak who is a pole who was in Vietnam , lives in the states and pretends he's Jewish (because his ex-wife was ) but really is a catholic  is absolutely hilarious to me..All the characters in this movie are worth mentioning but space runs out !I'd conclude that this movie is a rare type of low budget , non-Hollywood-mega-project movie that to me is at a higher level than many action-packed , super-fx ,multimillionaire movies that are coming out these days . I'll certainly look out for more Coen movies...",The Big Lebowski

I just saw it again a few nights ago and laughed out loud at least a dozen times. It has so many qualities that you look for in being able to watch a movie more than once (memorable lines- ""Hey man there's a beverage involved here!"" great characters- when will I see a movie about Jesus the bowling freak and an interesting plot- too involved to mention)The performances by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman are just incredible, I could remember after I saw it the first time I wanted to become the Dude. Steve Buscemi is also great in a more relaxed comedic role opposed to his normal freaky type characters. Very original and funny.",The Big Lebowski
880,tack211,Are you kidding me?,10,21 June 2000,"This is one hell of a film.  I first saw it in the theatre as a preview (my teacher at the time often gave us free passes!!) before I had heard any bad press about it.  I was so confused the first time, and wondering what was this about, that it made me want to see it again.  That is when I know that I am going to like a movie, when i want to see it again.  The main character, The Dude (Or El dudarino if you are not into the whole brevity thing) is quite simply the laziest person in the world.  The Dude, whose life revolves around drinking White Russians (Which I now drink mostly because of the movie, and mostly cause I like um!) and smoking grass while driving and listening to some Creedence, is ""taking it easy for all us sinners"".  The plot revolves around him, and how his soiled rug gets him into a fandangle that no one could expect.  The movie does so much with so little, kind of in a Seinfeld ""show about nothing"" type of deal.  But what makes this movie a 10 is the superb acting!!  What a cast, Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Jullianne Moore, and of course the gorgeous Tara Reid.  This movie has so many intense conversations, that you could practically watch it with just the sound on, and still laugh your ass off. Please, ignore what anyone says, and watch this film, and then watch it again, cause it gets funnier every time!",The Big Lebowski

It is so hard to make good comedy that is even funny the first time through, but the quirkiness of the characters in this film and the brilliant dialogue create a world and story with depth and style.

886,mbutle27,In the parlance of our times...,10,17 April 2002,"I haven't stopped watching this movie since I first saw it about 2 months ago. I guess by reading some of the other user comments that this is the kind of movie that you either love or hate - and I love it!The story is fantastic. The running theme isn't particularly complex but it doesn't need to be. It puts the incredibly laid-back Dude in a series of outrageous situations that no stoner should ever be exposed to! I guess the funniest thing about the movie is that I know a guy who could be evenly compared with the dude and I suppose I'm not the only one - haven't most of us known (or been) a lazy stoner at some point? The story is perpetually fuelled with a line of eccentric characters, all quite different from the dude in personality and lifestyle. The Dude's interactions with them in his quest to obtain a replacement rug are hilarious (especially with the Malibu Chief of Police!!).Julianne Moore is fantastic as the artist/feminist millionaire. The line she delivers to Dude while Bunny's porn film is running is a classic: ""The story is ludicrous"" she says with disdain, viewing the porn flick with her critical eye (post-irony at its best!).I did think that the inclusion of Sam Elliot was a needless one. Essentially the story didn't require the 'insight' of a narrative and although I appreciate the comic value of his inclusion, perhaps he might have been better utilised on another project?Essentially, and I think this is the case with more than one of the Coen Brother's films, is that the dialogue is excellent - it is nearly always the way the lines are delivered that makes the scenes so funny, not the actual lines themselves. This is true for many different characters in this movie, from the Big Lebowski himself to the Chief of Malibu Police (who's scene with the Dude is comedy genius).Anyway, I can't knock it - I love the movie, ""His Dudeness"" is one of the funniest/best characters I have ever seen and I cannot recommend this movie enough...particularly if you're a middle aged, jobless stoner...I'm not, by the way...middle aged that is!",The Big Lebowski
887,dapianist20,It deserves the high 8.0 rating,8,15 April 2006,"Could you imagine anyone taking care to check the ""contains spoilers"" box before submitting a comment on this movie. The joys of this movie have so little to do with plot revelations that checking that box would be superfluous even if the comment did reveal spoilers. This is the Cohen brothers best movie. I will make a bold prediction: In twenty years, Fargo will have receded into the shadows of forgotten but once praised films, while The Big Lebowski will still be providing its own unique version of wit and humour to film lovers who appreciate the kind of comedy that comes out of funny characters and organic natural feeling dialogue.",The Big Lebowski
888,zroussel,It is a crime this did not receive an Academy Award,10,27 November 2006,"I can say without a doubt that this is the Coen Brothers best film. Though they have made many other great movies and are two of my most favorite directors/writers in Hollywood now, they absolutely shine with The Big Lebowski. The funniest thing about this movie is how all of the peculiar and hilarious characters and situations come together so gracefully. Where Raising Arizona and Barton Fink tried fairly successfully at accomplishing this feat, the Big Lebowski does this flawlessly: The Dude's crazy dream sequences, Walter's paranoid, infuriated ramblings about history and American policy, the ridiculous dialogue between the Dude, Walter, and Donnie, Maude's elitist LA interactions with the Dude, the aggressive German kidnappers, and the narration of the strange Cowboy, played masterfully by Sam Elliot all merge seamlessly to form a comedic masterpiece that gets better on repeated viewings. Like the hugely successful show Seinfeld, the main characters, Walter and the Dude, never seem to accomplish anything of any value, but the combination of Walter's incompetent aggression and the Dude's incredible misfortune produces a story as complex as it is funny. At the end of this movie, you may be asking yourself what you just saw and what good came from all the foul language and unusual dialogue between Walter, the Dude, and the other characters in the movie. The best thing is to just sit back and laugh uncontrollably at the strange situations the characters find themselves in, along with the accompanying dialgue. Every time I watch this movie, and it has been quite a lot, I pick up new quotes and find new things to laugh at. As mentioned in the summary, the fact that out of all the Coen Brothers films, the only two to win Academy awards was Fargo and O Brother Where Art Thou is a travesty and does a disservice to the inherent comedic genius that this movie displays. Although I hate saying never, I don't think a movie of this comedic magnitude will come out again.",The Big Lebowski
889,johnnywillis75,I love this film,10,15 May 2001,"This film is absolutely fantastic.  It stands up to many re-watchings, this is mainly due to the quality of the dialogue.

It seems that every line has been crafted with the keenest of eyes for hilarity. Every word out of almost every character's mouth is funny. Bridges is genius as the slacker-bum, John Goodman is extremely entertaining as the put-upon, aggressive Vietnam vet.

As other reviews have noted, you will either get this film and love it, or you will probably hate it. Either way is fine because that's just like your opinion man. In my opinion, this movie stands up to repeated viewings with ease. It seems like there is always a new nugget with each view. The layers in this film are staggering, and I don't think it's hyperbole to say this is the greatest film ever made. If you have seen this film once, and you hated it, I encourage you to watch it two more times. I was hooked from the opening credits, but my wife did not like it. But, she likes me, so she did not balk when I wanted to continue my habit of repeated viewings. After about the third time, she was quoting lines and pointing out some of the motif's.

I'd say it's the most stupid movie i've ever seen. There is no hidden humor, or smart comedy. Everything goes around the big dude. Or I'd say, the big asshole! The movie itself is a comedy, it is a parody of a comedy. I have no clue why people loved this movie so much. I start seeing the movie because of that and I've to say it was a complete disappoint. How someone can laugh with such a bad movie? No clue, if someone can explain me that I'd really appreciate it.

It will leave you two options , whether you will like it or you will hate it. The characterzation are so brilliantly made by coen brothers and executed with perfect casting. Jeff bridges as ""the dude"" -jeff lebowski had completely nailed his role. And john Goodman as Walter done his supporting role wonderfully and its worthy of notice. Its an comedy element filled with brutally action package. The big lebowski is an movie with sharp witty story line and more you re-watch this film more fun you would get for sure. And of the best in comedic genre.",The Big Lebowski

I watched 3 times , never love it but I didn't get bored during the movie at all . I don't know if I may watch this movie again or not. But it is certainly an original movie. While watching this movie your face is in the same shape , never laugh hard, don't get upset or anything. Your face will be in the same form at the beginning of the movie and when it ends. If you have time and don't know what to watch it is a good choice.

It's one of the greatest pieces of cinema, a true classic. The Coen brothers are legends and this is one of their best. Bridges and Goodman are top of their game. Do you know what, I'm going to watch it again right now, for about the hundredth time!",The Big Lebowski
901,gjz,My Favorite Movie. Go rent it.,10,1 October 2001,"There are so many things that I like about this movie.  First of all, I don't think there is another movie that has so many great quotes in it, not to mention that every character in the movie has their share of great quotes.  If you are looking for a movie to quote, look no further.Second, The Dude has the coolest style.  A guy obviously stuck in the Sixties, he carelessly and effortlessly slides through life without a job and has the best time at it.  A kind-hearted, innocent guy, he loves to bowl, get high, and listen to Bob Dylan.Third, the plot of this movie is excellent.  Dont be mis-led, there is very little apparent plot.  However, there is very much going on that is unsaid which makes the movie very complex and intricate.  To understand the motivations of the individual characters takes some concentration.  It took me many times of watching it to fully understand what each character had going on in his/her head.Fourth, the dialog is highly developed.  The conversations in this movie are so unlike most movies.  The characters continuously interrupt each other, change subjects, lose their train of thought, etc.  Such a refreshing departure from the cookie cutter Hollywood film.  But yes, there is an unusually high amount of obscenities.  However, this movie does not attempt to sugar-coat the vocabulary of real people, they keep it true-to-life.As with most of the other Coen brothers' movies, the underlying theme is this:  Something bad or illegal happens, and instead of the onlookers trying to help the victims, they decide to try to make a personal gain from the situation.A masterpiece!  10 out of 10.  Now go out and watch it.",The Big Lebowski

With the attempted help of his friend, bowling partner, and Vietnam vet, Walter(played by John Goodman), they try to solve the mystery of ""where the f**k is the money?""

904,rfsst11,Personal Opinions Are Laid To Rest,10,1 August 2002,"""The Dude abides"", and rightfully so.  With their greatest piece of work yet, the Coen Brothers have created a masterpiece with ""The Big Lebowski"". Whether consciously or subconsciously the Coen's have painted the most life like picture of Hollywood that has ever been seen by the naked eye.  Raw, honest, and most of all hilarious ""The Big Lebowski"" tells the story of three good friends who's lives revolve around bowling.  Even when one of them, ""The Dude"" (Jeff Bridges), gets caught up in a case of mistaken identity they still focus on the bowling league.  This isn't all folks, HA! Anyone with half a brain will laugh at this movie, although anyone with the other half still in tact will surely see that even from Sam Elliot's opening monologue this entire film spoofs the hollywood process.  Regardless of whether you recognize this or not, personal opinions are laid to rest with this film.  It has been said that every individual has an individual personality but along with the dawn of this beautiful new Coen Brothers film is also the realization that there is not one person on this green old earth that can make it through ""The Big Lebowski"" without laughing.  It is packed so tight with jokes that it'll make your grandadie's constipation look like a piece of cake.  If you don't like this film or rate it anywhere below a 7 that is fine, for at that point of clicking the ""vote"" button with 7 or below you shall finally find that you are indeed retarded.  Proceed to the doctor's immediately for treatment, because if you rate this film 7 or below you are in need of medical attention.  Personal opinions are laid to rest!",The Big Lebowski
905,jack_kelly,Emperor's New Clothes,4,18 April 2003,"This film had glowing recommendations from so many people.  The Big Lebowski had an intriguing plot idea, and some very good performances, e.g. from John Goodman in particular. It is just that I can't bear the 'Oh so clever' style of the Coen brothers films. It seems they put a lot of effort into being quirky just as an end in itself, and this film was no different.There is nothing wrong with dream sequences, off the wall dialogue etc. Far from it. They feature strongly in some of my favourite movies of the last 30 years. I am a huge fan of David Lynch for example. But this film has a sense of desperation on the part of the filmmakers. That feeling of End of Year film school project about it. Like the geeks who watch the great movies and want to distill all the best bits into their own creation, but just don't get that you can over-egg it and whackify it so much that it simply becomes awfully tedious. There are probably a lot of people out there who admire the intentions of a film like the Big Lebowski, without stopping to think: 'Did they actually laugh?' I felt like I ought to at times, without actually getting near.",The Big Lebowski
906,dynogt777,This movie is amazing...truly a masterpiece.,10,4 April 2007,"Detailed in every scene, rich characterization, diverse soundtrack, witty real life dialogue. This movie is God. I feel that it takes a lot from a movie to make me leave with a sense of satiation, but this movie does it for me. Wonderfully written and directed by the Coen brothers, it is yet another masterpiece from them. Another thing is, that this movie never tries to be funny. It doesn't have random quirky characters or punch lines, it all comes from the scenes, very naturally. 10 out of 10. And how cool is the scene when the sheriff throws and hits The Dude in the forehead with the mug, and the mug doesn't turn while it's in the air! So many great scenes.",The Big Lebowski

He always annoyed me before with his pompous type characters but in this he is superb. He made me laugh constantly throughout the movie. I always loved the Coen's work as it is just beautifully shot and conceived - always interesting without moving too far from the joy of the story. The Big Lebowski is my favourite Coen movie because it deals with a more common theme and is easy to relate to. Jeff Bridges character I could watch all day and sometimes I wish there could be a follow up movie. The story is full of superb characters and settings, whilst the soundtrack is excellent. Do yourself a favour and see this film.",The Big Lebowski

He will have you rolling in the aisles as they say. Go get yourself some jellies, a man cardigan and a ""caucasian"" and enjoy this delectable offering from the Coen brothers.

I like my movies good.  Fargo wasnt. Anyways, The Big Lebowski is about american's other favorite past time...BOWLING, and a few bums who play it. Jeff Bridges proves he is an awesome actor in this movie playing 'The Dude.' Only a great actor can play a character like 'The Dude' and then a few years later get an Academy Award nomination for playing the President of the United States in 'The Contender.'

911,MCwieger,Who is Walter talking to?,10,14 February 2003,"I've seen this movie about 9000 times, but one line remains a mystery to me. In the scene where Walter tells The Dude that The Jesus is a pederast, the following conversation takes place:Walter: So how much did they give you? Dude: 20 grand man, and of course I still get to keep the rug. Walter: Just for making the hand-off? Dude: Yeah, they gave the dude a beeper...so whenever these guys call... Walter: What if it's during a game? Dude: Oh, I told them that if it was during leagueplay... Donny: What's during leagueplay? Walter: Life does not stop and start at your convenience, you miserable piece of s***.My question is about this last line. Who is Walter talking to? It seems unlikely that he's talking to The Dude, because I don't think he would call The Dude a 'miserable piece of s***'. Well, he could, but only when emotions are rising. This seems not to be the case in this scene. On the other hand: if he's talking to Donny (who ís always interfering at his convenience) his timing is way off (his reaction would be way too fast)!Any ideas?",The Big Lebowski
912,kawajust,A lifestyle film of the aging hippie,9,8 August 2002,"The Big Lebowski is a rare comedy in that it makes you laugh at the reasons for the Dude's behavior rather than at the absurdity of the situations he is in.  It's not a detective/comedy and it sure as hell isn't a bowling comedy; it's a lifestyle movie with wonderfully written characters.  Jesus is a perfect example of comedic genius with a flat character.  He's a pedophile bowler that has the ability to intimidate guys like the Dude, who probably doesn't really even care enough to be intimidated. But that's the type of conflict that this movie deals with.  The Dude and Walter never really learn any lesson or go through any major character changes.  You must keep in mind that this movie is just a crazy story whose main purpose is to express the comedic traits within the characters.  Fans of character conflict should love this aspect.  Those looking for a buildup and climax may not appreciate the story so much.  The whole detective story is given to the audience blatantly.  But, like the Dude, you become wrapped up in the craziness of all the distractions from the cast of characters such as Autobahn that are thrown into the mix.  So when the story ends, you feel like the Dude; someone who just drifted along as everything sort of passed right by you. But worrying about all of it would be very un-Dude.",The Big Lebowski
913,Ajax6001,"The Dude Abides, and Shatters the Comedy Genre Single-Handedly",10,11 July 2008,"I've watched my share of comedies, and in all this time I've only been able to single out four as definitive and making a mark on the movie industry and establishing themselves as classics: Ghostbusters (the first one, mind you), Caddyshack (also only the first), National Lampoon's Animal House, and (drum roll please), The Big Lebowski. Let's discuss that last one further, shall we? The Big Lebowski follows the story of Jeffry ""The Dude"" Lebowski, an L.A. bum who gets sucked into the underground crime scene, drugs, sex, rock and all. I can't really give away more info than that without spoiling something, so that's all I will say in regards to the plot. On the character side of the movie, the whole film is comprised of bums, thugs and wackjobs, all who are lovably bizarre. While the characters all seem to have one-track minds, you never seem to tire of them and are all amusing in their own way (for example, Walter constantly tells Donny to ""shut the f**k up"", Donny is always almost completely unaware of what's going on throughout the movie, The Dude always says some witty one-liner that lightens the mood the way any stoner could, etc.). The script is absolutely hysterical and top-notch, as can be expected of the Coen brothers, and the acting is completely believable, despite how far out the dialogue and events are. How could anybody forget The Dude's reaction when they drag him out of the limo while he's drinking a White Russian? Well, here it is: ""Whoa whoa, h-hey dude, careful, I've got a beverage here!"" Overall, I loved everything about the movie. It's an incredibly fresh, original movie that can't possibly be put in any specific genre it's so unique. Here's a warning though: the first time you watch it, you might not enjoy it as much as the next time, as it's one of those movies that gets better with age. This can perhaps attribute to the commercial and critical failure it exhibited upon release, but since has grown so huge, that they have made a convention for it named Lebowskifest. Once you get sucked into the wild world of The Dude, you will never want to leave.",The Big Lebowski
914,lee-1031,About the best movie I've seen,10,28 March 2009,"The thing about TBL, is if you have never seen it, it sounds like the most boring film of all time. I find myself chuckling to myself and when my wife asks why, I will quote a part of the film, laugh some more and then she threatens to leave me!! The film is clever on so many levels. First of all it picks a time in history where very few movies back track to, it pick a subject matter that very few films pick ( bowling, porn movies, nihilists etc etc). Great performances, Jon Goodman especially was just made for the role. Above all the script for this film is so tight that you can watch this film time after time and not get tired of it and Goodmans speech on the cliff to the dead Donny is one of the greatest bits of film ever.",The Big Lebowski
915,lil_LEBOSKIurbanACHIEVER,I Never Thought Perfection Would Be So Funny!!,10,11 April 2009,"Before I met ""The Dude"" and the rest of the cast I wasn't sure if the Coen Brother's could ever top their Citizen Kane(Fargo). After watching ""The Big Lebosky"" I found out just how talented these writer/director's were. The Big Lebosky is a genre trend setting masterpiece. With dialogue so close to perfection I would not change a single sentence. This is a movie of pure clever genius and has tremendous replay and stay power. Mark my words when I say: You can watch it a million times, and you will never get sick of it.The story begins with the raspy southern drawl of ""The Stranger""(Sam Elliot) preparing us with narration as the ever schlepped ""Dude"" (Jeff Bridges, Jeff Lebosky) isreturning home from buying some milk at the grocery store.Upon arriving home he is greeted by a couple of Jackie Treehorn's (notorious pornography producer) looking for ""Jeff Lebosky"" After realizing that the""Dude"" was not in fact the right ""Jeff Lebosky"" (and one pee'd on rug and thus plot set up later)The Henchmen exit. Thus we are brought along on one of the funniest and darkest tales of redemption, slacking, anger, mistaken identity, and league bowling! I can honestly say the best ride of my life was on the not so righteousand lethargic tale of ""The Dude"" While he tries to seek reparation for the ""soiled upon rug"" in his living room, and finds himself in the midst of doing so, getting involved with so many different forms of deception, unwanted responsibility and paranoia as The Dude agrees to act as courier when the other millionaire ""Jeffery Lebosky's""(David Huddleston) kidnapped trophy wife ""Bunny""(Tara reed) allegedly gets kidnapped.Needless to say The Dude is in well over his head and Murphy's Law soon becomes reality to the motley crue of characters .This movie is so cleverly written you wonder just how the plot gets pulled off with such grace. And the answer to that question lays in the A. The dialogue B. The character development And C. The amazing acting from the entire castAs also starring ""Walter Sobcheck""(John Goodman) ""Theodore(Donny) Karabatsos""(Steve Buscemi)""Maude Lebosky""(Julianne Moore)Guest starring ""Jesus Quintana""(John Turtorro) ""Brandt""(Phillip Seymour Hoffman)ETC.And all these actors, no matter how small the part all make a juxtaposing impact On the all around greatness factor of this films hilarity and tightness But make sure you relax your face muscles the night before watching this moviebecause the best of the best in my personal opinion comes from ""The Dude and Walter""(Bridges and Goodman) as ""The Dudes"" Pacifism mentality counteracts with the Ever un predictable and over steam headed Vietnam veteran ""Walter Sobcheck""(Goodman)who will take any chance he can get to turn a conversation into reminiscing about his life in the war. With that being said Also turning in an unforgettable performance is ""Julianne Moore"" as ""Maude Lebosky"" the daughter of millionaire business man ""Jeffrey Lebosky""(Dave Huddleston) The on screen chemistry between these cast members is extremely memorable and sometimes confrontational, but always entertaining and clever. When you view it for yourself, You'll find yourself quoting and watching in awe,as these actors quickly become your bowling buddies and transform the silver screen into pure gold. this masterpiece of satirical cinema will intrigue your intellect and challenge your sense of humor and boundaries as The Big Lebosky will invade your personal space by remaining in your mind and everyday references of the films idiosyncrasies will become adjacent to your vocabulary. Pare all that with the groundbreaking camera work and all star soundtrack and you have a film that comes as close to perfection as you will ever find.All in all and pound for pound ""The Big Lebosky"" is a 10! A true Timeless piece of film. The Coens Sistine Chapel if you will.So ""Ever thus to the deadbeats"" that choose not to enjoy!! But hey "" that's just like... My opinion man!""By Anthony S. Timo",The Big Lebowski
916,mattgreene,"Wow, dude, you have to see this movie!!",10,8 January 2003,"This film is a masterpiece of frivolity, invention and homage. Although Bridges is superb as the dude, the deadbeat 90s reincarnation of the film noir detectives of yesteryear, and the setpieces are truly memorable, the show is stolen by Goodman's ferocious Vietnam vet. He manages to play the frustration of paranoia and impotence within the constraints of compassion and, above all, loyalty. Hijacking the dude's every move, he muscles in on the chance to escape the boredom of his provincial life and glowers through the entire movie.Of course, these are not the only notable performances from the Coens' familiar cast. The film is helped by a host of SUPERB supporting performances (Buscemi's put-upon bowling pal, Turturro's latino pederast and the awkward PSH particularly spring to mind) - and the script is just amazing. This film is destined to become a classic.It is punctuated with moments of genius (from the best golfing gag ever through the North by Northwest pencil tracing homage, and the most painful ""hit in the face with..."" scene on film) and beautifully shot throughout (the bowling ballet opening sequence and Jesus' Hotel California are a joy to behold). And the narrator could not have been better chosen.The film does maybe lack the melancholic, disciplined humour of Fargo, but it is just as good a film in other respects.I recommend you buy, rent or steal a copy right now and enjoy yourself thoroughly!!!",The Big Lebowski

It took my a few viewings to really catch everything. The key is that you have to watch this movie without really worrying about the plot. You just have to enjoy the characters and the dialogue, which in every scene, without fail, is as witty as any I've ever seen.It's the kind of movie you'll memorize, repeat parts of over and over, and watch over and over, enjoying it more each time. Every character in it has a unique charm, and despite the fact that they are all pretty much cartoonish caricatures, they all somehow have depth, and the interplay among them is just priceless.

The main characters are Jeff Bridges (who plays such broad roles like The Muse, The Contender, and Sea Biscuit), John Goodman (who should have won an oscar for best supporting actor for his character, Walter Sobchak)Juliane Moore (Maude Lebowski)and Steve Buscemi (who is unique in every Coen Brother movie).The first time I saw this movie, I will admit that I enjoyed it, but did not fully appreciate its level of humor and raw talent.  I thought the middle section was a bit too depressing and long.  But trust me, this is a movie that gets more funny every time you see it, even if it's your thousandth time seeing it. Its level of comedy, action, brutality, and vulgarity become that much more evident and important.The characters are brilliantly written by the coen brothers, and, likewise, are brilliantly portrayed by the actors.  The Big Lebowski is like no other film.  It will make you laugh and it will make you cry.  There is no other film such as TBL that is sharp and witty all the way through.

This film created 'The Dude' as one of the most iconic characters in film. The slow witted, care-free stoner played by Jeff Bridges makes for a hilarious character with biting satire and tongue and cheek humor. He is also complimented with John Goodman's character, Walter, as a Vietnam veteran who can't seem to not relate things to the Vietnam war. His cool and calm personality overshot with an immediate burst of rage conveys a contrast which is both hilarious and extremely entertaining. His character is also famous for the quote ""shut the f*** up, Donny"" and ""Am I the only one here who gives a f*** about the rules?"" which resonates in pop culture references today. The great soundtrack featuring famous artists such as Creedence and Johnny Cash really emulate the context of the film and attribute to the overall mood of the oxymoron phrase 'chilled-out- mayhem'. However, this satirical humor is not for everyone, which can really take away from the film for some people. Overall, the story is quite good and the characters are excellent! The amazing surrealist dream sequences also create an atmosphere of 1970's Woodstock and the generation of free-love (and habitual marijuana smoking).

We had an unemployed bum who drank white Russians all day get caught up in a plot, this was so silly and unbelievable that I was soon bored,hoped it would get better but it didnt. If it had a good storyline or was funny I would have liked it,but it was neither. How people said this was a great film is beyond me.",The Big Lebowski
929,Stop_calling_me_Warren,"A must have, must watch, piece of cinematic genius.",10,13 June 2013,"In every great directors career there is a film where all the stars align. The script is perfect, the acting is impeccable and the movie seems to just magically fall into place. The Coen brothers could have not put together a more well balanced and enjoyable film, this is there defining moment, this will be there masterpiece.Years later audiences still enjoy the story of ""the Dude"" (Jeff Bridges) and his laid back approach to life, not to mention his love of bowling with his eclectic mix of friends - Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi). This is a tale of intrigue and layered complexity that is only reserved for the finest of films with stellar performances by the whole cast, including a legendary performance by John Turturro as ""The Jesus"".As we wait for the next generation to discover this cinematic gem. This film will abide, as will The Dude.",The Big Lebowski
930,walter-sobchak,Cult classic with great performances... only gets better with age,10,10 April 2006,"Is it just me or has this movie progressively gotten better every year since it was released like 8 years ago?Just the setting of the film, the brilliant performances by John Goodman, Jeff Bridges, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturo, Julianne Moore, David Huddleston (millionaire lebowski)... besides it's so well written and is just a riot. How many memorable lines can you fit in one movie? Lebowski is great as an almost tragic/flawed hero figure. He's a hard luck lazy stoner, yet you still get a feeling of greatness from him. From some of the things he tells us about his past and from his respected presence in the film, he's just truly a classic, unforgettable movie character. I still think the best role in the film is played by Goodman, who is absolutely f**king brilliant as Walter. I mean, admit it- who didn't forgive him for 8 years of Roseane on the spot? I like the slight philosophical under-text of the film and all the archetypes it portrays between the Dude, Walter, the Millionaire Lebowski, Maude Lebowski, nihilism, pacifism - and using it all as a punchline is hysterical.Oh, and Turturo is immediately in the running for 'most memorable comedy cameo ever' with Jesus, the perverted foul-mouthed sh*t-talker.

I grew up living like the Dude. The Dude reminds me of my Uncle...not in a bad way, but with deep respect to living one's own life.The Coen brothers have created a film to be topped, if it was possible. Barton Fink was great..Fargo, yeah it was exceptional story-telling.

Keep rewatching to love this one,10,16 September 2021,"I don't write reviews for movies with high ratings as they already have overflowed reviews praising how great they are... But this movie deserves even more appreciation than it actually deserves...Watched this in 2015 when i wasn't very fond of english movies with more dialogues, profanities and black humor... I was just the kind of guy who watched english movies for non stop action... So i tried to explore more genres for interesting plotlines and the movies i chose to watch were very bad choices at that time... Big Lebowski was one of them... I wasn't ready for this kind of humor at that time... Concentrated too much on the kidnapping subplot and i lost all the fun in the movie... Ended up hating it for no reason...6 years later, after watching almost 700+ english movies and with a high taste for silly and black humor comedies i decided to rewatch this again... Felt so great for a midnight watch... Literally didn't care about the plot or the kidnapping sub plot... and that did the magic... With the no.of characters and their subplots you may expect the movie to be many things but it's never turns out to be the way you expect it... and that's the best thing about this movie... Watch it just for the funny dialogues (especially shut the f up donny gig), soundtrack, stylish cinematography and the brilliantly placed ""Jackie Treehorn's short film""... There's more things so cool in this movie but it is not posssible to simply write them down here... Just watch and you'll understand... You'll enjoy this more than what you expected...

The characters are deep and interesting, and even the most minor of characters have their own unique personality. The camera work is ingenious, as are the visuals and costumes. The comedy comes in from all sides, whether subtle, witty, or straightforward. The Coen Brothers use stereotypes and wording like Van Gough used a brush. It is one of those few movies where almost every line is quotable and easily recognizable. Unlike most comedies (if you could call it such) the story is both followable and enjoyable. One of the true masterpieces of our time. If you don't like this movie, I'm sure you hate to laugh.",The Big Lebowski

The Dude, as the narrator so eloquently puts it, is the man for his place and time. Although he defines laziness, and The Dude is lazy, he is a hero. But what is a hero? I'll stop stealing lines from the movie and just say that this is one of the best put together movies of all time. It is a cult classic and I can't imagine why it's not more mainstream, but it is clever, original, and I must say that John Goodman as Walter Sobchak is one of the best characters to ever grace the big screen. If you've seen this movie, I'm confident you'll agree. This is one of the few films that can be silly and real at the same time. To put it bluntly, this is a must see if you haven't seen it, and if you have, watch it again; it only gets better!",The Big Lebowski
935,gnome11-1,You are not privy to the new s***,10,29 October 2006,"This is my number two all time favorite movie. Why? This movie is an onion. Even now years after it's release, I watch it and the layers unfold. What I have discovered is that the movies that somehow, mysteriously move me in unknown ways upon the first viewing turn out to be religious metaphors. Blade Runner. Pretty obvious if you at least a faint whiff of imaginative ability. The Big Lebowski is more subtle. Watch the movie and count how many times ""Jesus"" is said. Was Jesus betrayed by the Jews? He was in TBL. It's all there. An ""immaculate conception"", a betrayal, a crucifixion, a rebirth. Who is the Jesus metaphor? It's the car. The car carries the characters throughout the movie and is sacrificed in the end by nihilists. The car carries the reward, the million dollars, that turns out not to be there because the money is not the reward. Bowling is the reward. Donny is reborn as The Dude and Walter return to the lanes. The idolater falls. Maude becomes the next Mary Magdelene. Walter is Paul. The Dude is John. Not even the Cohen brothers can escape the Judeo-Christian core of our society. Of course, escape is not necessary. If Jesus can't f*** you on Saturday, he'll f*** you next Wednesday.

936,stalhusseini,The essence of a simple story told well,8,1 August 2020,"Simplicity: There's nothing ground breaking in the story. In actuality it's really quite simple. The real enjoyment in this movie is how well the story is told.
Characters: Everything down to the eccentricity of the characters (and the script) is what keeps you engaged at all times. It's not if Bonnie was kidnapped, who kidnapped her and who has the money. It's actually more about each character and the interactions drawn from the variance of each of their personalities that light up the movie. From Jeff Lebowski and his facade of wealth and collectiveness, Maude and her band of odd friends, Walter and his flash-back Nam infused angry interactions, the nihilists and their strange ferret intimidation techniques to Donny and his pitied like-ability.
Unpredictability: You can never really tell what's going to happen from one scene to the next, it's far from predictable. The story takes a series of turns with the viewer never really guessing what or who is going to pop up next - that for me, is probably what differentiates the exceptional directors from the good.
Script: It's those little touches such as how The Dude recites what he hears and picks up around him and uses it in latter interactions with the other characters; that level of detail is what separates it from other movies. The conversations are fun and the dialogue among characters interesting.",The Big Lebowski
937,joepug96,The Big Lebowski is One Big Laughbowski,6,24 May 2015,"There are many things to love about movies; the smell of popcorn, the taste of butter, the John Goodman moments, and of course, the Big Lebowski. If you like to laugh at one deadbeat stoner who has a passion for oriental rugs, and forgets to comb his hair, you will love this movie. It is written by the Coen brothers, who have wrote about a thousand great movies. Unfortunately they are dead now, but this movie is still alive. MY favorite thing about this movie, the reason why it gets 9 stars, every single line is mildly funny. Of course, you cannot laugh out loud at every single line, but you will find yourself giggling inside every time John Goodman opens his mouth. God, so funny. Watch this movie sober or not...your choice! Either way, funny as hell. At one point the Dude is tripping on a illicit substance...oh my god, the cinematography is amazing!!! The viewer is experiencing a TRIP in someone else's perspective. Very novel and unique. I watch this movie whenever I can with friends. You should do the same :)",The Big Lebowski
938,amway-1,This very well may be the best comedy I have ever seen,10,22 May 2005,"In my short 25 years of life I have seen a decent amount of movies, missing out on some of the classics from before my time, however I would still say that for the right sense of humor this movie is nearly perfect.This movie is very dialog oriented, which to some extent necessitates that you get to know the characters to really understand why some things are funny. I personally loved this movie when I first saw it but probably would have only a given it an 8. The more you watch it however, the more your knowledge of the characters from the fist viewing build very quirky and nuanced personalities that make the characters very real and yet surreal. This makes it that much better, when you hear some of the comments because you know where they came from, just as if you heard of something that a friend did and depending on who that friend was, it makes their actions that much funnier.There are flaws in every movie, but what matters is do they bother you or not, and I don't remember any that do, and I have seen the film at least ten times. Each time just as good as the last, and this is what makes this movie so special is repeatability. You can watch it and start it over right afterwords and laugh just as hard.John Goodman should have at least been nominated for a best supporting actor as he is excellent in this movie as Walter. Also, John Turturro is excellent as ""the Jesus"" in a limited role. Other actors turn in very good performances as well. I think you need the right sense of humor for this movie to work for you, but everyone that I do know that likes it, loves it and that makes it worth viewing, because if it does work for you, you will understand where the genius is located in this film and you will love it as well.I won't mention any details about the film, because thats what the film is for and frankly if I tried to summarize it it just wouldn't do the movie justice.See it sometime when you're bored, and hopefully you will see what I see in what I still say is the best comedy of the 90's",The Big Lebowski
939,deebosong,a filmic pinnacle,10,6 November 2005,"All of the elements that comprise this film are superb. The script is hilarious upon first viewing, but becomes ingenious with each subsequent viewing afterwards. I try to use big words to sound pretentious because the film makes me feel inadequate because of its amazing craftsmanship. The filming itself is beautiful, especially the slow-motion tracking shots. The mannerisms and characters are what truly make this film shine. The repetition and over-assertion of each character is so over the top that it reaches the point of absolute hilarity.before you watch this film, ask yourself one question: ""mind if i light a j?""",The Big Lebowski
940,ramos-alexandre98,The Big Lebowski is the best mess you could watch.,10,4 March 2017,"The first time you watch The Big Lebowski you tend to find it messy and not very coherent, but that's exactly what the movie needs. The Big Lebowski isn't about the dude or his rug, it's not about bunny and her problems with known pornographers, it's not about Jeff Lebowski giving the dude a ringer, and it's definitely not about Donny. Shut the f*** up Donny. No, the movie is really about the characters. Its about watching these very imaginative characters and their mannerisms. Its about watching how they act and react with one another and seeing how their personalities get them in and out of tough situations. Ultimately the plot is so messy because the Coen brothers don't want you to focus on the details on why what is happening or what motivation brought these characters here. There is but one motivation in the movie that matters, the dude wants his rug back and he just wants to get it back without having to bother anyone. The situation these characters are put in is what makes the movie funny and the way that they react is how we learn from these characters. Plot is important in some movies, but when the characters are the ones who have the story to tell, why not stop worrying and just listen to them. The next time you watch this movie, forget about what's happening and just enjoy these hilariously inapt characters navigate their way through the mess that is The Big Lebowski.",The Big Lebowski
941,donaba13,Love it.,10,4 January 2016,"This is a plot and dialogue that perhaps only the Coen Brothers could have devised. I'm thinking less of their clarity in ""Fargo"" and ""No Country for Old Men"" than of the almost hallucinatory logic of ""Raising Arizona"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy."" Only a steady hand in the midst of madness allows them to hold it all together--that, and the delirious richness of their visual approach.Anyone who cares about movies must surely have heard something about the plot. This is a movie that has inspired an annual convention and the Church of the Latter-Day Dude. Its star, Jeff Bridges, has become so identified with the starring role that when he won the 2010 Oscar for Best Actor, Twitterland mourned that his acceptance speech didn't begin with, ""The Dude Abides."" These words are so emblematic that they inspired a book title, The Dude Abides: The Gospel According to the Coen Brothers, by Cathleen Falsani.

Between the Dude, the Stranger, and Jesus there are plenty of strange and hilarious characters. The story takes one turn after another and is in true Cohen Brother's form. I have seen this movie many times and still laugh out loud. Walter and the Dude go on a quest to replace his rug, it really tied the room together. In the process the Dude finds himself confused with the Big Lebowski who sends the dude on a wild task. In this movie each new character seems to top the one you just meet.

I watched it a few years back, before I really heard about it, and thought it was OK. I made it through the whole thing, but there were parts that dragged and it's also borderline depressing at times, but has enough humor sprinkled in to get me through. it IS quirky, and I can see how the 'cult classic' gets attached due to the repetition of certain comedic themes throughout. It's definitely not a 10/10 movie, and likewise the 1/10 reviews are basically just a reaction to it's overrating.I've heard a lot about how great it is since the first time I saw it, and recently just watched it again since it was free on TV.

I wont get into the plot details, since I think it's best to watch it for the first time without knowing anything about it. Then watch it again a couple weeks later. I'll bet you laugh more the second time you see it. Office Space was the only other comedy that had this affect on me. Oh and one other thing. DO NOT WATCH THE EDITED VERSION ON TV!

948,hemartens,The Best Comedy FilM in the Last 25 years,10,17 September 2005,"The Big Lewboski is among the best comedy films of all time, kind of. It has a very disjointed storyline, and is, at times, hard to follow (or comprehend). However, the writer allows enough latitude for the actors to make it work. The casting of Jeff Bridges as 'Dude' is central to the movie. I can't think of another actor that could have pulled this off as well as he did. It really tied the movie together.The Dude seems not to want anything but to be left alone. The uncertainty presented to him as the result of a case of mistaken identity (maybe) shatters the warm comfort that 'Dude' has spent his life creating and maintaining. It makes him very uncomfortable, and causes him to react accordingly. Walter is the Dude's salvation. He forces the 'Dude' to pursue the source of his discomfort. The more that Walter exerts himself, the better it gets. John Goodman's heroic, manic performance gave the movie the only sense of stability in an otherwise chaotic circumstance presented to the 'Dude'. Both Walter and 'Dude' are pretty intelligent, introspective and spiritual beings in their own rights. They just don't know it.I have no idea what Donny was doing in the movie, other than to have Steve Buschemi die in yet another Cohen brothers film. The dialog is wild. The Big Lewboski yelling 'The Plane has crashed into the mountain', Maudes discussion of the effect of vaginae on men, and all of The Jesus' scenes, down to his purple jump suit (The Purple Jesus) are bizarre. Everything coming out of the 'Dude's' mouth is very funny. Like 'A Night at the Opera' and 'The Producers' good comic actors, presented with the right opportunity, can take it over the falls.

This movie includes everything that an excellent movie calls for; awesome casting job (Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Sam Elliot, Steve Buscemi, etc), humor nothing can deliver, bowling, some lazy guy named Dude, to some ""self-described"" Nihilists. The Coen Brothers have once again made movies more enjoyable. I highly recommend this flick for anyone who needs a good laugh.",The Big Lebowski
966,garlank,10 - A supremely enjoyable show,10,27 November 2000,"This movie is simply fantastic.  The Coen brothers have once again outdone themselves.  Amazing imagery coupled with a fantastic, though brief, performance by John Turturro paints a hilariously poignant picture of the bowling subculture.  The Coen Brothers have long been known for paying less attention to the plot than they pay to the visuals and the interaction of their characters, and this film is no exception.  The plot is somewhat confusing and contains innumerable twists, but what lies at the heart of this movie is solid: The relationship that is developed between John Goodman and Jeff Bridges is funny, and it reveals quite a bit about their characters.  Overall I thought this movie was outstanding.  Even though it didn't reveal any eternal truths about the human spirit, I had fun while watching it, and that's all the truth I need.",The Big Lebowski
967,Parham-2,Dude...,10,12 April 1999,"Those who have said that this is not a good movie didn't understand one bit of it, or tried to understand too much. This is an 'awesome' movie (,man) and it is unique in the way it brings bottom-of-the-belly laughing (or: the instinctive, natural type of laughter if you'd like) to a modern genre that's hard to associate with humor. One of the best I've ever seen besides Jim Jarmusch's Down by Law. Not that it's comparable, but...In short, it's a very funny, yet intellectual look at life through the eyes of the bozos that we all are. Go see it!",The Big Lebowski
968,Blinkste,Probably one of the funniest films involving John Goodman,10,23 August 1999,"Often mistaken as one big acid trip (well, it is, but it's so much  more), this hilarious flick truly lets John Goodman shine.  I have yet to see him in anything funnier.  The rest of the cast just makes this movie something to be watched time and again.It's now 2nd on my alltime most watched list, behind only Monty Python and the Search for the Holy Grail (which I've logged over 100+ viewings, so it'll be hard to top)..",The Big Lebowski
969,Da_Jesus,Hilarious !!!,10,20 January 1999,"I think this is on of the funniest movies of all times, the characters (especially Goodman's) are so weird that you have to laugh on almost every line they say, go buy it! I gave it a straight ten. Also, Dude, people keep telling that the plot is not good or at least not as good as Fargo's. well that may be, but  therefore it was so funny and I think that the plot isn't so important here anyway. You'd miss most of it anyway cause you've got to laugh all the time. Also, try some White Russian during the movie it'll improve a lot if you don't like it.",The Big Lebowski
970,DrTrobridge,Best Coen Brothers Flick to Date,10,3 May 2003,"I personally think this is truly one of the great masterpieces of comedic film.  Awesome.  It offers so much nuance comedy that it becomes the type of movie you can watch about thirty times and still find new things to laugh at.  If you have not seen this movie, please do so ASAP, it will be good for you.",The Big Lebowski
971,Rosdower,A movie for the ages,10,15 April 1999,"The Big Lebowski is my favorite movie. No other has such subtly masterful interaction with such colorful characters. It is not a high suspense thriller or a drama, but a fun-time feel good comedy that doesn't try too hard to get there. But isn't that what the movie is about.It's just about sitting back and enjoying the ride. I have seen it +20 times and it still has a friendliness about it. The action heats up just so often, but it doesn't disturb.There is so much slacker-ing that it sort of rubs off and makes you feel at peace just to sit there and take it all in. And it's real funny too.",The Big Lebowski
972,cheng66,What a great movie!,10,4 August 2000,"This is definitely one of the smoothest movies ever.  The Dude is such a great character, no cares in the world.  John Goodman is also great, I love all his Vietnam flashbacks and his slamming Donny is hysterical!  If you haven't seen it then this is definitely a great movie to see!",The Big Lebowski

There are so many moments in this movie that you just think about and chuckle over for days afterwards...Jeff Bridges is truly awesome as a lazy anti-hero.  But I really think every eccentric character in this movie shines, they're all doing something very different here...This is my favorite movie of all time.  I laugh every time I see it.  I really do!",The Big Lebowski
974,Lulu-32,Geeeee!,10,18 May 1999,"The Big Lebowski is a must! It makes me think that there's still some great american movies, with UNpolitically correct attitude.

Only the Coen brothers can make movies like that, and they must be thanked for this true jewel!",The Big Lebowski
975,starr-10,I just loved it :),9,3 June 1999,I thought this movie was off the wall and I loved it.  I really got a good laugh and a kick out of this movie.  Jeff Bridges' acting was excellent...very cool and calm.,The Big Lebowski
976,Bazzer-2,Funny film full of great one-liners,9,22 May 1999,"I'd seen no reviews or synopsis of this film when I picked it up in my video library. The fact that it was a Coen brothers film was enough to make me rent it. I was not disappointed. It's a warm, funny film full of great one-liners.Only the Coen's could take a rambling plot and laid back characters and tie it all up neatly together. For me, their finest.",The Big Lebowski
977,cassady,the dude abides,10,11 September 1999,">Superlatives ensue: I find the Big Lebowski to be exceedingly entertaining. The three main actors (Bridges, Buscemi and Goodman) did an extremely convincing job. In fact, it's hard for me to watch another movie with Jeff Bridges in it and not expect him to say, ""new shit has come to light, man!""The convoluted plot comes ties together like a perfect episode of Seinfeld, and the scenes are shot beautifully, esp. the bowling and dream montages. The script is witty and hilarious without being juvenile and soooo many classic lines can be gleaned from it. This movie is a classic--you will laugh harder everytime you see it. The Sarsparilla man is right--it does make one feel safe knowing that ""The Dude"" is out there.",The Big Lebowski
978,hanzoitami,This movie rocks!,10,29 June 1999,"The first time I saw this great artwork of the Coen brothers I was really surprised that it is able to top ""Fargo"" and ""Raising Arizona"". Goodman's ""You're entering a world of pain""-scene is the best of all in my opinion. ""Mark it zero!"" and ""Have you ever heard of Vietnam?"" are my all-time-favourite phrases of this movie and of course the destruction of ""Lenny's"" car was really awful! I can't get tired of watching this movie again and again and again!I'm giving this movie 23 points out of 10!",The Big Lebowski
979,superfuz-2,"No, Dude, we don't mind if you do a J...",10,29 August 2001,"It's the little things about a Coen-constructed universe (read ""film"") that make me laugh, and ""Lebowski"" is no exception.Case in point:The Dude is lazy, has no job and lives, er, slacks in Venice Beach, where he painfully scrawls out a check for $.69 for White Russian fixin's--specifically Half-and-Half--at the local supermarket.  Not exactly the most intelligent mind on the planet.  Yet he knows the exact street in North Hollywood where to find the In-N-Out burger (for those who are LA-challenged, North Hollywood is about 20 miles inland and worlds away from the beach).  Makes you wonder if somewhere in that hazy melon of his he knows every location in LA County.  Of course he knows this.  It would be out of character if he didn't.And another:At Jackie Treehorn's Malibu beach pad, Treehorn grills the half-baked Dude as to where Bunnie Lebowski might be.  Suddenly the conversation is interrupted by a phone call and Jackie scrawls info on a pad while on the phone.  We get the requisite zoom-in close-up as the Dude watches from across the room.  Jackie excuses himself and exits.  The Dude as Philip Marlowe rushes to the pad and lightly traces onto it.  Instead of an address or any useful info about the aforementioned phone conversation, he instead traces a picture of an man, shall we say, standing at attention.  Of course he does.  Treehorn is the self-described ""publisher"" who created ""Logjammin'""...what else did you expect to find on the pad?!Now I'll concede that events like this can not possibly sustain a film, and I think ""Lebowski"" was lambasted because it is a film not about story, but about a collection of characters.  Funny characters. In fact, even the idea of taking a burn-out and dropping him in the middle of a convoluted Marlowe noir-like caper is enough to make me start laughing.Yes, the language is crude.  Yes, it sometimes feels like a collection of scenes strung together.  I will say, however, this film is incredibly funny and hits the mark again and again.",The Big Lebowski
980,sksen,my new favorite film,10,13 September 1999,"This movie quickly became my favorite film after seeing it as ""El Gran Lebowski"" in Chile this past summer. This is an artistically beautiful movie, with great character development, hilarious dialogue, gorgeous cinematography, and music that serves to bring it all together. Also a great movie if you're in an altered state of consciousness, if you know what I mean. John Goodman and Jeff Bridges make a wonderful comedic pair. This is yet another gem from the Coen Brothers.",The Big Lebowski
981,Jim-491,"It's about characters, it's about acting, and Jeff Bridges is Outstanding!",10,29 October 1999,"I found Jeff Bridges' performance in this movie to be delightfully haunting. The supporting cast is strong, the plot is unpredictable, and the laughs are frequent.....the 'Dude' is straight out of the late 60's.....with Bridges absolutely *nailing* the character. Great movie, great portrayal.",The Big Lebowski
982,dpsdroog,Hilarious . . . nobody mess wit' Lebowski,10,11 October 1999,"The Big Lebowski - a virtual masterpiece.  Stunning visuals, from excellent dolly shots to amazingly trippy aerial sequences.  Add to it the wacky perspective which made Fargo so great, and you can see why Lebowski is another hit.  Great performances from Bridges, Goodman, Buscemi, and Turturro.  Turturro's character alone is enough to get the repeat viewer laughing. . .and everything else will take care of the first timer.  Read Drewzus' review. . .this is hilarious.  Side-splitting.  A comic masterpiece which cannot be overlooked.  Yeah.

If you have a slightly 'stupid' sense of humour (i.e. if you appreciate the ridicule, like, for example, what the Monty Python do), you'll just love this film. Personally, I found it so funny that I was crying.",The Big Lebowski

985,leiflorentz,"Terrific, great sense of humor.",10,6 April 2000,"I use this film as a vitamin pill! It is so well made, with so many small crazy or should I say normal things that goes wrong. Some of it reminds me of myself when I am having one of those days where everything goes wrong.Did I laugh when the Dude hammered the chair to the floor against the door so nobody could get in..... Jeff Bridges plays so well, he should have had an Oscar for this role. I keep watching this film again and again, and new things to laugh at appears every time.This is just my sense of humor! It is brilliant and cleverly made. Fargo was great too. I wonder if there are any other films made by these same people, in such case I must watch them.",The Big Lebowski
986,robbyk72,Satirical and comedic genius at work,10,17 August 2001,"Okay, so the language is extremely rough, probably the highest number of f words to ever be uttered in a movie. But in a decade chock-full of trashy, pathetic attempts at comedy, The Big Lebowski is a refuge that is the most original comedy in years. Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski, with his laid back attitude, gets mixed up in a screwy plot of misunderstanding and just plain idiocy. His buddy Walter, the scene-stealer, the Vietnam vet. Walter's personality and foul-mouthed rants create a crude but hilarious comedic effect. The dialogue is witty throughout the movie, full of sarcasm and political satire, and must be listened to carefully to be sure none of the punchlines are missed, as this movie could be a radio program and barely lose any of the humour. I warn you that this movie bores anyone bearing a sense of humour that is unwilling to endure such an absurd comedy.",The Big Lebowski
987,motoracer,appreciate this gift,10,23 May 2000,"you must watch this film at least 3 times to fully appreciate its brilliance.  jeff was born to play this part.  he does dude so well that whenever you see him in any other role, you will think bl.  the acting in this film is truly the finest i have ever witnessed.  many people disagree because it is a comedy.  they think that oscar caliber acting should be reserved for dramas.  rent this one and watch it alone, concentrate, let the dude embrace you,  let yourself embrace the dude, be one with the dude and you shall see the light.  grasp the greatest lesson. abide.",The Big Lebowski
988,cfood,I got a beverage here man!,10,15 July 2000,"This movie is like a big, great Three's Company episode in a way.  Constant misunderstandings.  Note that all the characters misread the dude's motivations for doing whatever it is he's doing.  Jeffrey Lebowski believes he's trying to rip him off.  Jackie Treehorn thinks he's trying to muscle in.  The detective thinks he's a brilliant sleuth (playing both ends against the middle etc.)  And so on and so on.  Everyone finds it impossible to believe that he's JUST THE DUDE, takin' 'er easy for the rest of us.  Also, why wasn't Jeff Bridges nominated for an Oscar for this?  This has to be his best performance ever, and it stands out among a host of them here.",The Big Lebowski

Well like Homer Simpson all of us has a little ""dude"" in him.  Thats a good thing we need more Dudes then attitudes in our times.  Although all might not agree with him one gets the feeling of what the films message is and thats what ""ties it altogether, did it not! ""Grade A""",The Big Lebowski
990,rptrus,The funniest movie I have seen,10,8 June 2002,"This movie grabs me for so many reasons. First of all I really dig the way the dude handles things. He's just so damned lax about everything. Watching the dude go about his stuff is the perfect antidote for the hustle and bustle of today's overly-corporatised world.The humour of this film is unique and enjoyable because of the strong characterisation of the film. Praise goes to Jeff Bridges for totally immersing himself into his role and really embracing it. The humour of the film can be very subtle at times, and as you watch it and learn more of the dude's habbits, it becomes even better. It's a very detailed film. Support cast was terrific, esp. John Goodman as the rambunctious Vietnam vet. Go see the movie and be amazed at the production, witty (yet unpretentious) dialogue, quirky characters and an amazing soundtrack to boot.",The Big Lebowski
991,fabian.baumer,Must see,10,7 August 2000,"The only movie I watched three times in cinema. Thoroughly funny, John Goodman alias Walter Sobchak is outstanding. The introduction of ""Jesus"" is one of the highlights in cinema history (although the character itself is as unimportant as the whole bowling matter...the movie even doesn't tell you who won the semis...).",The Big Lebowski
992,Grinder-7,The Coen Brothers' Masterpiece,10,13 August 2000,"I have never seen a movie that I can watch over and over again and still laugh out loud at every classic moment.  The Big Lebowski does it for me all the way.  Many people told me it was stupid and not funny.  Of course those were the same people who regard American Pie as the funniest movie ever. Not that slapstick comedy doesn't make me chuckle, but I cannot hold a conversation with somebody who thinks Don't Be a Menace to South Central... is a classic.  This movie gets my vote for good wholesome family fun.",The Big Lebowski
993,shooter92_,Brilliant Comedy,9,19 June 2001,"The Big Lebowski is a wonderful comedy with a twisting somewhat complex plot not usually found in this genre. John Goodman delivers an especially humorous performance as an Vietnam vet who never really has anything under control and Jeff Bridges plays the slacker ""Dude"" who gets thrown into an amazing twist of events thanks to merely sharing the same name as a millionaire. Highly recommended if you've never seen it.",The Big Lebowski
994,Polaris-13,One of the funniest movies of all time!!!,10,11 September 2000,"Bowling, Beer, and Drugs; what more could you possibly ask for from a movie? How about a show dog(with *&%$#@# papers).  Bowling, as it is meant to be played, is the key element in this movie.  Donny is without a doubt one of the funniest characters in any movie ever made.I love Walter's take no &*^% attitude.  He always has a plan(I also heard that he was in NAM).  He refuses to give in to any opponent, calling them all *&%$#@# amateurs.The Dude.................Need I say more!",The Big Lebowski
995,Q-57,An inspiration.,10,20 September 2000,"This movie I saw for the first time in winter of 1999. I didn't really pay much attention to it because I was tired and I had seen two other rentals prior to this one. I thought to myself, nothing special. Then about a month to a month and a half ago I saw it at the flea market here for sale at $5. There wasn't much else to do or buy so I got it. I watched it again and it blew me away. It is such a well constructed plot with many twists and turns and incredibly well developed and sympathetic characters. I found a new respect for John Goodman's acting abilities. I had always thought that Jeff Bridges was ok but his performance here made his stock go up in my personal opinion. Then you have other people who made the movie a delight like John Turturro, Steve Buscemi, and Julianne Moore. The Coen Brothers have an amazing talent for screenplay writing and I can't wait for their next project. It has even inspired me more to write a little something myself.",The Big Lebowski
996,ccitroen,It don't matter to Jesus!,10,1 January 2001,"With characters ranging from Walter Sobchak, the angry Vietnam vet to Jackie Treehorn, the infamous pornographer, this film has it all. I often find myself repeating lines from this movie to my friends, just because they will be forever impounded in my mind. No matter how many times I watch it, I will still laugh at every scene. For my money, this is the greatest comedy ever produced.This film not only provides non-stop laughter, but it teaches us an important lesson about life. We must adopt the Dude's carefree attitude. This movie teaches us that all you need in life are a few good friends and a recreational activity in which you enjoy greatly, in the Dude's case, bowling was what he enjoyed the most. Whether we put this lesson to use ourselves or not, it's like the Stranger said, `It's good knowin' he's out there. The Dude. Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.'",The Big Lebowski
997,mir605,Best Comedy Ever!!!,10,4 January 2001,"The Coen brothers `Big Lebowski' is without a doubt the best comedy movie of all time. Jeff Bridges plays the character of the lazy pot-smoking `dude' so well you actually believe the hilarious remarks he makes are genuine. His friend Walter (John Goodman) is the stereotypical Vietnam vet that manages to relate everything to Vietnam no matter how remote the situation is. This movie is great aphrodisiac after a long stressful day at school or work. Unlike most comedy movies `The Big Lebowski' gets better every time you watch it. I recommend that a person watch it at least twice to get the full effect of the Coen brothers' genius, better yet buy the video or DVD, this movie just keeps getting funnier every time!",The Big Lebowski
998,regis-14,"Like all things Coen, incredibly underrated.",10,24 April 2002,"You know you love them.  Coen movies have that quirky something or other that at times will make you laugh out loud or squirm in your seat, sometimes at the same time.  The only movie I think that doesn't fit this mold was Blood Simple (less funny than the rest).  But it was still VERY good.  Some movies are more funny.  Some are more violent.  But there is always a mixture of the two.  It's refreshing to see movies these days that don't resort to spooge jokes and CGI F/X cheating and hip-hop soundtrax. I'm starting to ramble.  Anyway, I love this movie.  Love, love, love it. When I got a DVD player last fall this was the first movie I bought, and I have watched it on average of once a week since then.  I'm no expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I know a well made movie when I see one. And I know when a writer/director cares for the characters, and it really comes through in this movie.  And it's funnier than anything that's been made in years.  Even After all the times I see it, I still laugh out loud at certain parts.  My wife and I quote it constantly to each other.  My Favorite parts (possible spoilers ahead):1. The scattering of the ashes (It's wrong but it feels oh so right), 2. The Dude in the Eagles Cab (I, too, fervently hate the Eagles) and, 3. The ""marmot"" in the tub So I recommend to anyone who wants a good laugh and a weird plot with some truly loveable characters, see this movie.  10/10",The Big Lebowski
999,Reverend_A,The greatest movie ever made,10,1 April 2006,"Every once in a while there comes a movie that leaves you with the feeling that you have witnessed genius. 'The Big Lebowski' is definitely one of those movies. You become entranced from the start by Sam Elliot's opening monologue and it never lets up. On first viewing, the movie can seem slow, confusing, and even boring, but do not let that stop you from seeing it again. 'The Big Lebowski'is an acquired taste. It is very good at first, and after a few more viewings it becomes undeniably excellent. Brilliantly crafted in the style of an old Hollywood mystery, 'The Big Lebowski' is one of the funniest and most original movies of all time. Its craftsmanship is perfect and the actors, notably Jeff Bridges, Phillip Seymore Hoffman, John Torturro, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, and John Goodman, all put up some of the best performances of their careers. The script, by the Coen Brothers, is truly ingenious and its creativity is awe inspiring. There are hilarious subtleties that one only notices after seeing it again and again. I have seen the movie 17 times and it honestly gets funnier each time. 'The Big Lebowski' is truly the greatest movie ever made.",The Big Lebowski

And you gotta check out the Lebowski Fest web site - a whole community of ""Little Urban Achievers"" with T-shirts, bumper stickers, Lebowski Fests.

It is about finding your inner-dude... And maybe, just maybe, this particular movie is growing in popularity at this particular time because of the way things are - the pathetic and clueless leaders we have - the direction they are taking us... yuk! - our seeming inability to do anything about it - the endless frustrations of our menu driven impersonal telephone world - and maybe there is also some nostalgia for the 60's and 70's, when for a brief shining moment, there was a sense of real life happening, and a sense of optimism blooming - that is missing today - ""well, uh, that's just your opinion man...""",The Big Lebowski

I don't know why this is but I really wish they could make a movie which is half as good as Lebowski. Stop using A list actors such as Hanks and Clooney and go back to your roots. Jeff Bridges performance as 'the dude' is a joy to behold. Can't imagine Hanks in that role or Clooney as someone who does'nt roll on Saturdays. I can only think that as their movies gained popularity in the 90's they thought they would up the ante and work with big movie stars and have bigger budgets. It has'nt worked!

I Love the whole cast, sound track, silliness and seriousness! The whole thing was marvelous!! There couldn't have been a better choice of th actor for the ""Dude"" Jeff Bridges had it down from the very beginning milk drinking scene to the instigation of the whole ""mystery""! A few of my favorite scenes being the whole slam dunk and mitterating scene. The degradation of the car. The ""Nialist"" in the parking lot. The ferret in the bath. Him listening to ""The Best Bowling Moments"" on a Walkman. The walk along the water with Donny in hand. Just to name a few. And who could forget the little hottie, the Mrs. Lebowski!",The Big Lebowski
1012,bwfboris,one of the best movies,10,26 February 2020,"While I'm writing this in 2020 as an 18-year old, my favourite movie is still the same one as it was when I first saw The Big LeBowski when I was about 12. Back then I just thought it was hilarious, but when I took a closer look in the years after I came to realise that the dude works in mysterious ways.I think we should all be more like the dude, especially in 2020, and try to live our lives as they come, in stead of constantly being unhappy with what we have or who we are.If you take a good look and try to understand the beauty of this movie, it will bring you a lot of joy for the rest of your life. The dude abides.",The Big Lebowski
1013,SeeTheBigBoard,Sometimes there's a movie.....,10,15 April 2001,"This is, by far, my favorite comedy of all time.  The acting is so real and the situation is so insane that it probably has happened somewhere out there.  Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, and John Turturro all give excellent performances and give the movie such depth that you can't help but grow to know and love there characters.  The music is terrific, especially ""Just Dropped In"" by Kenny Rogers and the New Edition, which is now one of my favorite songs.  This is one of those movie's that, if you carried the script in your pocket, could provide you with a thought provoking and extremely hilarious quote for any occasion.  Truly a masterpiece.",The Big Lebowski
1014,colkurtz103,"Hilarious, Full-Octane Cohen Brothers",10,24 April 2001,"This movie has spurned a cult following in the last two years. Simply quoting lines from this movie to others familiar with it sparks immediate commaradarie.  ""Oh, Nice Marmut.""  You can't help but chuckle at that. This is one of the best modern day film noirs I have ever seen.  At first glance it's a great comedy, watch it again and you notice it's also a noir, brilliant!   If you like the Cohen brothers watch:  ""Miller's Crossing."" Other movies that may interest you: ""Chinatown"" ""The Big Sleep""(the cohen's actually based parts of Lebowski on this film, look for the guy in a wheelchair) also ""Easy Rider""",The Big Lebowski
1015,camusslastride,"Who's the ""Real"" Lebowski?",10,7 August 2006,"This movie is definitely not for everyone; some people hate it and some cannot find it's humor. I find it absolutely hilarious! The casting is perfect and the dialog is fun. I like the way the characters mesh and clash and completely lose their tempers - John Goodman I'm talking to you - well done! It is funny and offensive to some, but I like that kind of movie.Jullianne Moore is so great in role of Maude Lebowski!Steve Buscemi and Philip Seymor-Hoffman also give great performances. Then of course there is ""the dude"" (Jef Bridges)the most laid back of them all. Be sure to check out his fashion choices (pay special attention to his shoes!) Someone mistakes him for a millionaire and instead of letting the incident go, an insane, dangerous and funny adventure results. How did he get into this mess? Bowling is known to solve all problems. As do White Russians. But watch out for those nihilists.",The Big Lebowski

Steve Buschmi is great as always, John Goodman gives his thoughts to the situation. and Jeff Bridges in one of his great rolls - as the dude. any one who likes this type of movies will not only see this movie, he will buy an original DVD of the movie to keep in the house. i have seen it at least ten times threw out the years. you never get tired from it.",The Big Lebowski
1024,kaeljw,Possibly the greatest film of all time,10,14 October 2020,"Let me start off by saying that I am a big fan of the Coen Brothers works. Films like Fargo, Oh Brother and No Country for Old Men are some of my favourite films. This one is no exception. This is a masterclass in scriptwriting. The way that every single character is fully developed (including the ones that are only in a single scene) is phenomenal. The use of language to portray a lifestyle is poignant. This movie is everything one should expect from a comedy movie",The Big Lebowski
1025,jddtmm,A stellar film by the Coen brothers,9,10 November 2020,I have watched this film multiple times and find it better every time I watch it. With extreme precision every line of the film is spoken in such a quotable way that by the time you are finished with the movie you can't help but make comments about every area rug you come across. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for something to watch and if your reading this review stop wasting your time and watch it already.,The Big Lebowski
1026,jeffhaskett,One of the best comedies,10,21 October 2020,"It is one of those films which you have to pay attention to ever satiric detail as they unfold. At first you think the movie is simply zany but as the story unfolds you can feel it grab ahold of you and want to rewind to see a given scene again. Bridges and Goodman are so hilarious as the unlikely story unfolds into chaos.
It is definitely a movie that I go back to watching again and again as each time I practically fall off my seat.
Thanks to great cast of actors for making this movie a classic.",The Big Lebowski
1027,munky02,Simply one of the best movie's you will ever see!,10,18 July 2001,"This movie crosses so many boundaries and limitations that 99.9% of all other comedies limit themselves to. Everything from a carpet p***ing thug to a pervert named ""Jesus"" that can bowl like no one's business is in this movie. Every scene makes my sides split. The plot rates up there with Akira and The Matrix, simply genius! So many twists and turns with an ending you have to see more than once to believe. Great music all throughout as well. Simply this movie has everything you could ask from a movie including many 1st rate A List actors that do a wonderful job. However do NOT see this movie if you are faint of heart or ears. LOTS of cursing as well as a few violent scenes and a couple nudity scenes as well as a hefty dose of inuendo and sexual jokes. But if you are like most people this will not even phase you and you will love every last line in the movie. I can't think of ANYTHING I would change in the movie.  Props to EVERYONE involved in making this movie, it is 1st rate.",The Big Lebowski

Its comedy is both subtle & clever. words fail me, but it has to be said that those of you who think Fargo is the greater of the two have ""lost the plot"". I could easily watch this film over and over & still find new hidden gems hidden within (you can't say that about many). I think people have a problem with it cause it has no real beginning or end its  a section in the life of ""the Dude"" one can really say ""it just is"". A masterpiece the thesaurus doesn't contain enough words !",The Big Lebowski

I mean, Walter Sobchak, you cant go wrong with a character like that. Especially when you cast John Goodman for the role. And Jesus. Don't forget about Jesus. Never have a character with so little screen time made such an impression. This may sound weird but John Turturro plays the best alleged rapist/self proclaimed bowling king there ever was. And he does it wearing a god damned hair net.I fall back on this movie when i'm sad, when i'm happy, when i'm alone or when i'm with friends. I always fall back on this movie.

I hope you won't stop judging a movie from how many times they use the word f**k, would be really sad if you did so cause you would miss one of the best movies of all times.The Dude, who for some might be a total loser, stands up to the condition of hero, a great amazing slacking hilarious hero. A mention of his own for John Turturro who, despite having a really small part in the movie, comes out with an outstanding interpretation of ""Jesus"" which would be worth the price of the DVD on its own.What can I say, I love the Coen Brothers and this is without any doubt their best movie so far.If you still haven't seen it give it a shot, you won't regret it!",The Big Lebowski

Please help to remove this movie from the top 250. I watched over 100 top250 movies and they were all worthy of a place in this ranking, but this one is such useless crap that it really has to be lowered in ranking. I normally enjoy this genre so it's not that i'm a hater of this type of movies, it's just not a good movie.Please watch it and give a comment, but i needed a second watch to finally make it to the end of the movie.

The Coens had always been masters of realistic sounding dialogue, in ""Fargo"" for example, but this movie puts it over the top.  Having lived in California for many years, it always reminds me of how people talked there; swearing, using ""dude"", ""man"", and ""f**k"", in every sentence, and not really finishing a sentence.  Overall a great movie.",The Big Lebowski

There are many scenes and lines that I find run through my head for awhile after I watch this. A number of great performances and it's interesting that over time, this cast looks stronger and stronger. As I watch this movie, it really appears that the cast is having a lot of fun making this film - relationships appear easy and no one seems to have phoned their lines in. I do find that I have to be in the right mood to watch it - it's great release when it's been a particularly stressful week, because in a way there's a lot about The Dude (Jeff Bridges) that appeals - a lot of people would like to be that free, but there's a lot of pent up stress in most people's worlds, like Walter's (John Goodman). Give it a try!",The Big Lebowski
1038,asdertfdss,A celebration of the unique nature of the lazy,10,25 September 2001,"To say the Big Lebowski is merely a comedy is to disregard what has to be one of the best scripted films to appear during the last 20 years.  Only the Coen Brothers possessed the bravery, foresight and genius to bring this celebration of the slackers and lowlifes to the screen.The strength of the Big Lebowski does not lie in its cinematography or its occasional special effects (which are excellent), but rather in its refusal to conduct itself like any other main stream film.  Repeatedly the film falls back upon the interaction between the characters.  Who can forget the various bowling alley dicussions between the Dude, Walter and Donny?  The way that through one conversation we are able to see deep into the far-out psyche of each character as they strive to plod along in their mudane and under-funder existence.The Coens attention to detail is another prominent feature of the film. Its the little things that count.  Such as the bullishly Jewish Walter's firm which is known as Sobchak Security, or SS for short.  Or maybe the Donnys inability to get a word in edgeways.  I have seen the film many, many times now, and each time I have seen something new, which can only serve as a testament to the Coens abilities as film makers.The plot of the Big lebowski is made so ridiculous that it could only be made 'real' by having a group of completely ridiculous characters.  The Coens refuse to leave even the most incidental character without some kind of strange background or character quirk.  Just see Brandt or the aggressive police sergent for examples.The Big Lebowski serves as a celebration of the lazy and unambitious.  In the Dude we find solace.  He makes you think: Why do i have to bother dealing with things?  Why stress over things that do not matter?As i believe a reviewer in Empire put it:  In an ideal world all films would be made by the Coen Brothers.",The Big Lebowski
1039,paulpetrey,'The Dude Abides',10,14 January 2007,"This is the Cohen's at their best - and the actors at their best! You put Miller's Crossing, Fargo, and Raising Arizona in a blender and you get the best 'Caucasian' ever made! How many quotes have come from this film? I've never gotten tired of this one. The guy that does the marmot scream used to live down the street from me. His voice is always found in their films. The last time that I talked to him, he was leaving Lexington for the West. He had just finished directing a Doc on 'Grunge Ukulele' musicians in the Pacific Northwest. I think that his most disturbing sound effect was the odd scream of the paid off boxer in Miller's Crossing. That one always makes ya wonder what grandpa's really going to do with the fire stoker when he picks it up on Christmas.",The Big Lebowski
1040,leetnichols,A subtle call for peace.,10,17 August 2007,"Like many I'm sure, I've watched this movie so many times, I can quote nearly every line. Needless to say, it is one of the most entertaining and laugh-out-loud stories ever told. But, watching it again recently, I was struck by a subtle theme that I hadn't caught on to before: this movie is very seriously advocating peace, in our lives, in our relationships, and on the world scene. It's a little bit discomforting how this ""comedy"" unintentionally reminds us that we are still fighting in Iraq after over a decade. Not to espouse my political views or suggest that this is a political film, but this film does focus our attention (via the Walter character) on our collective obsession with violence and encourages us to reevaluate our situation from the Dude's perspective: our communication lines are breaking down, ""new information has come to light,"" and like many of the characters in the film, we should be asking, ""WTF are we talking about?!"" When ""this aggression will not stand,"" the Dude doesn't raise a fist, ""the Dude abides"" and ""takes it easy."" The Dude is a ""bigger"" man; he IS the Big Lebowski.",The Big Lebowski

I mined the web for some information on it, and it seems like most reviews put it into the 2 to 3 star category. After seeing it, I couldn't disagree more. Not only is this movie hilarious, but it makes a quiet statement about living up to one's own expectations, and about life in general. Not everyone will ""get it"", as they say, but that's OK!

I knew the makers by their previous works but was not yet a fan. The first time I saw it I didn't understand what was going on. The second time I watched it I knew the plot and could therefore concentrate on the subtleties. That is what makes this film greatness. The Big Lebowski is a shining example of what film should be, a perfect marriage of superior quality writing and heart-felt acting from the masters of their respective professions, with an attention to detail unlike any other. Materials of the finest quality mature with age and stand the test of time. This film never gets old and only improves with each sequential viewing the way summer block-busters never can.

The humor is sparse as far as I'm concerned, with John Goodman's character being the only redeeming part of the entire movie.Yeah, I paid attention. And I watched it twice. It didn't help.Some people have raved over the joke that the main character's rug ""Really tied the room together"". If that is what passes for great humor, well count me out.",The Big Lebowski
1049,punjabi_chd,IMDb is not always right,1,2 March 2009,when i saw this movie i thought how the hell can this make the IMDb top 250 when it should have been in bottom 250.This film is about a pair of lazy douchebags who are supposed to make you laugh but all they are able to do is make u angry with all their useless talk. Then the hero gets attacked in confusion with a man of same identity and the attackers pee on his rug we are treated to his stupid talk of trying to claim the carpet from the original intended victim and the man throws him out.But unbelievably he employs him as a negotiator when his young wife is kidnapped.Julianne moore in the role of a nymphomaniac looks pathetic.And the hero's friend walter tries to be funny but he falls way short of that and makes you sleep with his boring and brainless talk.And i will not talk about the end but i will say it it's as stupid as the movie itself. So if you want to watch this movie on basis of its high rating you will be hugely disappointed. Avoidable.,The Big Lebowski

It has everything an excellent comedy should have - good plot, excellent actors performances, great camera work, music, brilliant dialogues and, most importantly, it is funny and entertaining no matter if watched for second or 1002 time.Be prepared that it will not make you roll on the floor laughing and it not as filled with gags as, say, Naked Gun series. Probably you won't even like it for the first time, or just find it weird. Trust me - just go watch it again.

John Goodman had a small role, the movie may of been more impressive if it wasn't seen as such as masterpiece. Worth watching ill admit but should not be raved about like a Pulp Fiction 2. Judge for yourself but your taste of movies would of swooped to a new low if you consider this as a 90's classic. Fargo, O brother where art thou, Paris... they can be remembered but this was just a standard movie to kill some time. Best 250 films of all time? hardly..

This is an ultimately cool and strange flick, filled with cool and strange characters.Jeff Bridges in one of the best and most interesting roles in his career as ""The Dude"". John Goodman gives an unforgettable performance as The Dude's (gun-)crazy friend Walter Sobchak. Superb acting together with great casting make this title a sure classic.

I thought:It's OK,quite nice, but nothing special. Three years ago I watched it again, and I found it much better. But that wasn't still it.Finally I watched The Big Lebowski for the third time last year and I was really amazed.Maybe I could say ""third time's a charm"", I don't know, maybe I was to young in 1998 to understand and enjoy the brilliance of The Big Lebowski or maybe it's that kind of movie which keeps getting better and better each time you watch it. It is one of my favorite movies, there's something magical about it.You can watch each single scene over and over again and not get bored. The dialogues are hilarious,but I am aware of the fact, that not everybody would like that kind of humor, but I just love it! Magnifficent performance from all actors, especially Bridges, Goodman, and Buscemi.But supporting Seymour Hoffman, Stormare or Moore are outstanding too. I' ve read that when Cohens wrote the script they had all these actors in their mind and You can see it on the screen!

It won't be for everyone and I can understand why some may find it a fairly odd film. Lets be honest... It is slightly odd but absolutely hilarious. John Goodman is fantastic as always and in my own opinion Jeff Bridges puts in his finest display ever as the laid back Lebowski. Steve Buscemi is... Well, Steve Buscemi but is perfect for his role.I don't feel all Coen Brother fans will love this as much as I do as I feel in many ways it is quite different from much of their other work. If I had to liken it to any of their previous work I would have to say the film 'The Naked Man.' Although as a Coen Brother fan myself It happens to be my personal favorite.Fans Of films such as 'Spinal Tap' and 'Withnail & I' will surely love this film. Just think, Students all over the world will be watching this film right now remembering various quotes to use from the film tomorrow. This may sound ghastly but hey...

The Coen Brother's truely are great filmmakers - constantly providing us with witty, original scripts and deep memorable characters.The Big Lebowski - as with all the Coen films - is driven by sharp dialogue and excellent characters. The 'Dude' is the personification of laziness acted to perfection by Jeff Bridges, always wearing the same tatty clothes and hilariously drinking a milky White Russian ""Hey man i got a beverage here!"" We first meet the Dude in a shopping mall - with milk on his moustache - hilariously writing a cheque for 69cents! John Goodman is the Jewish Vietnam veteran Walter Schobchek - taking every opportunity to shout about his dead 'buddies' from the war and shout at Donny (Steve Buchemi). Donny is a quiet man with very little impact on the narrative - however the comedic relationship between him, Walter and the 'Dude' is a charm.The atmosphere created here gives superb viewing, with top notch cinematography and genuine, if obscure, relationships between the odd characters. But what you will remember most from this film are the hilarious quotations - ""F*** it dude, let go bowling"", ""Well thats just, like, your opinion man!"" and ""Obviously your not privy to the new s**t, man"" to name just a couple.",The Big Lebowski
1056,eminencefront,There is no film around that better explores white Russians and bowling.,10,28 January 2003,"The Big Lebowski is frankly a terrific entertaining film.  When discussing the Coens and their output usually people jump all over Fargo or O, Brother Where Art Thou?.  I cannot fault them for this, as these are great movies. But I have always been drawn to those films that follow the bigger hits. The Big Lebowski wedged between the aforementioned Coen Brothers movies fits quite nicely.  The plot doesn't really matter.  It assuredly does twist and turn and is incomprehensible at times.  As this film is a take on the film detective genre, most notably The Big Sleep which doesn't make sense either, this is extremely acceptable.  Take the Bogart character that has all the answers out of the plot and place a burned out broke bowler that loves white Russians in his stead, throw in John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Juliane Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffmann, and a funny, well-executed story and you have The Big Lebowski.

The acting was good by all involved with the exception of Julian Moore who's acting was sub par. Worth a watch but don't go in expecting too much.

It's an intelligent script, fine tuned to make you laugh while you try to catch the underlying message.Every character fills the movie with flavor, while Jeff Bridges as The Dude and John Goodman as Walter Sobchak lead the cast, some lesser characters such as Philip Seymour Hoffman's Brandt and John Turturro's Jesus Quintana help to change the pace in the movie.This is one of this movies you watch and like, and after some time you see again and find a lot of small little details you missed the first time.It's definitely on my top 10 movies of all time, a must see.",The Big Lebowski

It was like they were giving us all the middle finger, saying ""Here's some mindless crap for you. Enjoy your Happy Meal.""I had come to expect so much more from a Coen Brothers film. Now they were just cashing in on Fargo and making something that would finally generate a mountain of cash. The whole thing was nothing more that a giant commercial to sell a soundtrack.It was the same old cast (John Goodman yelling...again). The script is rug thin. And the characters are some of the most shallow and unlikable stereotypes to ever appear on film.

If it does, what does that imply ? Let us first examine the evidence that support that this film does indeed presage the 911 Tragedy.What evidence is there to support this claim you ask ? EVIDENCE that will SUPPORT the CLAIM: Jeff Bridges dates a check for half & half creamer with the date of September 11, then the camera immediately pans to a TV broadcast of King George Herbert Walker Bush the 1rst, decrying the aggression Saddam was green-lighted by US Ambassador to UN April Glasbie under the direction of King George I to attack Kuwait as this was their concern, not ours. Glasbie to Saddam: ""has no opinion on inter-Arab disputes such as your border dispute with Kuwait."" Effectively double crossing their agent Saddam just as they did their foolish change agent & Prescott Bush protégé and financial aid recipient Hitler.Also in the film there is a scene where a man working the shoe rack @ a bowling alley, an obvious double of Saddam, points to the number 11 on a giant tower of a shoe rack stretching up to the moon.You be the judge.simply Youtube ""911 Hidden in Hollywood""",The Big Lebowski

Plain movie with no characters you will feel to remember. All foolish guys with no remarkable dialogs. Stupidity with no humor.

Take my words..if you don't obey the above hint...you are to suffer... 2 points for I laughed may be twice between 2 hours. There should also be a FAQ section explaining the movie cause even though I understood all mind-fck movies(and I really liked many), this one has clearly made me frustrated all day.

1076,nathandcornell,"The Big Lebowski, review with a focus on theme.",10,6 February 2011,"The Big Lebowski could be considered one of the greatest films of all time. In the film Jeffery Lebowski, or ""The Dude,"" as he is more commonly known (Jeff Bridges) is a lazy man who enjoys bowling, smoking weed, drinking white Russians, and listening to classic rock (especially Creedence Clearwater Revival). His life does not seem to extend beyond these simple pleasures, nor does The Dude seem interested in branching out. ""The Dude abides,"" as he says in self reference. This all changes when a couple of thugs try to shake him down for money owed by another man named Jeffery Lebowski, and one of them urinates on The Dude's rug. The Dude is convinced by his friend Walter, played by John Goodman, to go to the rich Jeffery Lebowski and ask him to replace the rug. Thus begins The Dude's story, which involves a ransom kidnapping, mystery, double-crosses, sex, and severed digits.The theme of The Big Lebowski is difficult to define at first, but perhaps it is best summed up by the Stranger, played by quintessential cowboy Sam Elliot, who says, ""Sometimes there's a man who, well, he's the man for his time and place... that's the Dude in Los Angeles."" That being said, the entire film seems to be an elaboration on this statement. Although the Dude is a painfully ordinary man, he finds himself in an extraordinary situation, and the audience is given the opportunity to see how he handles himself. Every character in the film is ordinary, however. As the story progresses, the power players, the criminal masterminds, and the femme fatal are all exposed to be just ordinary people lashing out in various ways as they do what they think they have to in order to survive. Through their collective actions, however, and extraordinary situation is created. This statement on human nature and especially the social implications of Los Angeles culture during the early 90's is both fascinating and hilarious. This integration of normal people and strange circumstances are characteristic of Coen brother screenplays, and although not as dry as Fargo, there are definite similarities in theme. The main difference in The Big Lebowski is that each of the characters seem to see themselves as some romanticized Hollywood character, each is the hero in their story. The one exception to this being the Dude, who is just happy to be himself, but gets caught in everyone else's stories.The theme is enhanced by the natural lighting techniques employed throughout the film. The bowling alley scenes are all awash in harsh fluorescent lighting, every detail and flaw of the middle-aged and mostly out of shape characters is bared for the cameras. In fact, most of the locations in the film appear to use the natural lighting, with only minor enhancements if necessary. These are all ordinary places, full of ordinary people. Along these same lines, the music for the film is wonderful. T-Bone Burnett, the musical archivist for the film chose an eclectic mix of music from Bob Dillon to Captain Beefheart, Nina Simone to Piero Piccioni, with surprises such as the Gypsy Kings covering Hotel California, and even some breathy, erotic chanting. The soundtrack is where the egos of these ordinary people can flourish, and the song for every scene is perfect considering the character of the chief protagonist/antagonist. The music allows the audience to see what each character hopes that they are projecting, despite their extremely human behavior. If this point was not obvious enough, the Nihilists (including Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea) actually carry a boom-box blasting German techno when they attack the Dude and his friends. The are just ordinary people, in an extraordinary situation, acting in very human ways while projecting Hollywood egos.Kudos goes to the Coen brothers and a fantastic cast for this incredible film.",The Big Lebowski

1080,fortne05,The Big Lebowski Review,10,11 February 2011,"The Big Lebowski is a unique comedy from the Coen brothers. It is about a man called ""Dude"" or ""The Dude"" whose life is a complete train wreck. His actual name is Jeff Lebowski and the narrator calls him ""the laziest man in Los Angeles County."" Consequences ensue when Dude is mistaken for a very rich man with the same name. Written and Directed by Ethan and Joel Cohen. Jeff Bridges leads the cast which also includes John Goodman as Walter, Julianne Moore as Maude and Steve Buscemi as Donny. The Dude's favorite pastimes are bowling with Walter and Donny and smoking pot. The two main themes in this movie are man's existential struggle and abuse and mistreatment of one generation to the next especially the 50s to the 80s. Take the bowling for instance, bowling is respected in this movie and several of the dream sequences involve the characters at the bowling alley. Anyone can go play bowling pretty cheaply but it's a professional sport. It is also an older expression of fun. All generations enjoy bowling. It's unifying. The Dude is symbolic of the 60's hippie happy peaceful pacifist stereotype. In the end, he didn't accomplish much. Walter finds offense in almost everything but claims not to worry about anything and takes every opportunity to remind anyone listening that he is a vet. Walter and The Dude are polar opposites yet turn out to be best friends. They must not have known each other in the 60s. The duo sets out on many a missions throughout the film but never end up with any results. Walter's constant interruptions and Donny never getting to speak and The Dude's struggle to explain most of his situations when only a few words would do become a running gag throughout the film. Some see it as a indictment of 60's counterculture. If instead of screaming about what they didn't want, they had articulated what they did want, perhaps they would have achieved more. For some, the 60's revolutionaries are looked upon as the century's losers. Donny's name is reminiscent of the 70's due to a famous brother and sister duo. He is constantly being interrupted, yelled at, and ignored by Walter and The Dude. He is shy, bland, a tag-a-long, and just a step behind. He admires Walter and The Dude but doesn't have the same moxy. This contributes to his fear-induced death. Donny is the only one of the three that actually bowls. The Dude never touches a ball and Walter picks one up for another scene but does not bowl with it. A generation lost and ignored. Jesus (John Turturro) represents the flip-side of the 70s a possible pedophile clad in a purple jumpsuit. He is sexually aggressive, colorful, loud but ultimately all posturing and no action.Similar movies would include Raising Arizona, The Big Sleep, Blood Simple, Barton Fink, Fargo, The Long Goodbye, Miller's Crossing, Punch-Drunk Love, Trees Lounge, and Rob Roy. Many techniques were used in this film especially in the dream scenes. The lighting the angles were perfect. It was so original and fun. These scenes were vital to the theme's message and they way they shot them was perfect. This is one of those movies you love or hate. You either get it or you don't. The first viewing is so unique and for me it took multiple viewings and a deep love for the film to really fully understand and appreciate it. The themes are relevant and the Coens are geniuses.",The Big Lebowski

I guess that's just how this whole cult movie thing keeps perpetuating itself on down through the ages. I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that.

1085,johnsj09,HUMN 246 H3-WW Assignment 5-5,10,7 May 2011,"The Big Lebowski revolves around a case of mistaken identity complicated by extortion, double-crosses, deception, embezzlement, sex, marijuana, and gallons of White Russians. Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), one of the laziest men in LA county, which would put him high in the running for laziest worldwide, enjoys hanging with his bowling buddies, gun-toting ex-Vietnam vet Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and mild-mannered ex-surfer Donny (Steve Buscemi). When ""The Dude"" Lebowski is mistaken for the millionaire Lebowski (David Huddleson), two thugs urinate on his rug that ""really tied the room together"" (1998) to coerce him into paying a debt he knows nothing about. While attempting to gain compensation for the ruined rug from his wealthy counterpart, he accepts a one-time job with a high pay-off, and enlists the help of Walter. Deception leads to more trouble, and it soon seems that everyone from porn empire tycoons to nihilists want something from ""The Dude."" The main theme of The Big Lebowski is disunity. All of the relationships among the elements in the film The Big Lebowski may seem to be enigmatic with each other, but this style of film creates an integrated system of disunity The Coen brothers, like Guy Ritchie and his movies Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, constantly use in their films divergence to leave the viewer and the characters in disarray with the plot. In the film The Big Lebowski the main character, Jeffery Lebowski, refers to himself as ""The Dude"". This element of the story becomes a motif. ""The Dude"" is referred to, and refers to himself as ""The Dude"" because it represents his personality, which is an easygoing ""cool"" character. The common Western society slang which is associated with the word dude is male prostitute. As the stranger says in his opening monologue ""there's a name no man would self-apply where I come from"" (1998). ""The Dude"" is continuously used by his friends and business associates through out the whole film. Although presented as a laid-back cool character, the Dude's title is representative of how he is seen by everyone around him.Bowling is a major part of the film The Big Lebowski. The art of bowling is played as a highly stylized ritual, and several dream/acid flashback sequences center around the game. Many different camera angles are used in bowling sequences from the up close shots of bowling balls on the lanes, to the almost cartoony dream sequences of ""The Dude."" One camera angle in particular that best represents the film is when the dude is dreaming and he is miniaturized and ends up inside a ball rolling down the lane. The camera rolling around and around, ceiling to floor, with occasional glimpses of the pins and the bowler represents the jumbled, topsy-turvy world of ""The Dude"" in the film. He never knows which way is up and what to believe. The entire film ""The Dude"" is left confused by the situation in which he has found himself in, and every time he thinks he has it figured out he is tossed in another direction that only leads to more confusion and befuddlement.The theme of The Big Lebowski is eclectic with its different motifs and divergent storyline, and the best way to summarize it comes from the opening monologue and ""The Stranger's"" introduction of ""The Dude"": Way out west there was this fella I wanna tell ya about. Goes by the name of Jeff Lebowski. At least that was the handle his loving parents gave him, but he never had much use for it himself. See, this Lebowski, he called himself ""The Dude"". Now, ""Dude"" - there's a name no man would self-apply where I come from. But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense. And a lot about where he lived, likewise. But then again, maybe that's why I found the place so darned interestin'. See, they call Los Angeles the ""City Of Angels""; but I didn't find it to be that, exactly. But I'll allow it as there are some nice folks there. 'Course I ain't never been to London, and I ain't never seen France. And I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, so the feller says. But I'll tell you what - after seeing Los Angeles, and this here story I'm about to unfold, well, I guess I seen somethin' every bit as stupefyin' as you'd seen in any of them other places. And in English, too. So I can die with a smile on my face, without feelin' like the good Lord gypped me. Now this here story I'm about to unfold took place in the early '90s - just about the time of our conflict with Sad'm and the I-raqis. I only mention it because sometimes there's a man... I won't say a hero, 'cause, what's a hero? Sometimes, there's a man. And I'm talking' about the Dude here - the Dude from Los Angeles. Sometimes, there's a man, well, he's the man for his time and place. He fits right in there. And that's the Dude. The Dude, from Los Angeles. And even if he's a lazy man - and the Dude was most certainly that. Quite possibly the laziest in all of Los Angeles County, which would place him high in the runnin' for laziest worldwide. Sometimes there's a man, sometimes, there's a man. Well, I lost my train of thought here. But... aw, hell. I've done introduced it enough.",The Big Lebowski

However, the briefcase is also empty and only has some telephone books in it for weight. Later, they find out that Bunny was never kidnapped; she was off visiting friends and returned home safely. Dude then confronts Mr. Lebowski and lets him know what all he knows and how he is actually taking the money and that there was never really a kidnapped.This film in my opinion was OK; I don't really understand why they kept the bowling alley in there which I didn't feel like it had really much to do with the movie at all. This movie is not one of my first to watch, as it seems like the movie is really all over the place and doesn't make much sense at all. The characters were all really good and outstanding actors and actresses. Some of the best of the best were in this movie and I think that is what made it a hit with so many people.",The Big Lebowski
1087,scottmliddell,Not out of its element...,10,8 September 2003,"You can try very hard for a long time to find something wrong with this film. Don't bother trying. There isn't anything. The script is wonderful ( as you'd perhaps expect from the Coens ), the casting and acting is spot on, the music is great and, above all, the feel of the whole thing is sublime. Pathos and humour in equal measure. Its difficult to pick out the best bits, there are so many memorbale lines and moments. Jeff Bridges looks born from the role of the Dude, Steve Buscemi and wonderfully understated, Julianne Moore almost unrecognisable quirky but it is John Goodman that steals the whole thing for me. His performance as Walter is one of the best you will see and is the main reason that you can watch this film over and over. It doesn't matter that you know what is going to happen and what he is going to say, the performance never disappoints. Whenever I travel on business I only ever take 1 DVD with me.

If one is fond of toilet humor and a seemingly endless stream of swear words coming out of the actors' mouths then I suppose this movie might be appealing, but I don't see the attraction. The plot of the movie is virtually nonexistent, and the dialogue is horrendous, mostly consisting of the f-word. By far the most obnoxious character is Walter, played by John Goodman, whose incessant uttering of the phrase ""Am I wrong?"" began grating on my nerves within the first twenty minutes.

1098,cinajj,Cannot be missed,10,11 July 2006,"Writing and directing yet another cult classic, the Cohen Brothers have once again concocted a masterpiece that gets better with every viewing. Witty, intelligent, vulgar, happy, sad, The Big Lebowski runs through the gambit of emotions like few other films can match. Wrought with eccentric characters throughout the film, The Big Lebowski creates some of the most memorable characters on the Tinsel Town scene. Jeffery Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), who goes by the moniker 'The Dude', an unemployed burnout who enjoys driving around, bowling, and the occasional acid flash back. Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), a Vietnam veteran, converted Jew, who's still living in the past of both the Vietnam War and his former marriage with his ex-wife Cynthia. Theodore Donald Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi), known as Donny, a California surfer who enjoys bowling, always seems a little lost, or at best a page behind the rest of the group. Jeffery Lebowski (David Huddleston), the real Jeffery Lebowski, the Big Lebowski, a paraplegic Korean War veteran supposed self made millionaire and head of the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers Foundation, who has a penchant for vanity, as evidenced by his choice of second wife, Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid), a young, beautiful, porn star nymphomaniac. This is just a glimpse at a few of the movie's characters who inadvertently interact together and solidify one of the movie's greatest achievements: the dialogue. The array of characters that the Cohen Brothers create, along with the brilliant casting of each character, allows them to script some of the wittiest dialogue of any movie ever written. Ranging from absurd and vulgar to intelligent and insightful, the dialogue flows so naturally and meshes so intricately throughout the movie that multiple viewings are necessary to completely appreciate the skilled craftsmanship of the syntactical and grammatical structure employed by the characters. The Dude enjoys life's simple pleasures and leads a normal dysfunctional unproductive life of drinking, causal drug use, driving around, and most importantly, league bowling. His apartment has a rug, a rug that really ties the room together. That is until his rug is mitterated upon by two of Jackie Treehorn's thugs in an attempt to recover a sum of money from The Big Lebowski. After a brilliantly crafted brainstorming dialogue session at the bowling alley with his eccentric bowling team, Walter Sobchak and Donny, the Dude decides to rectify his rug situation by going to the real Jeffery Lebowski, whose rug the thugs were really trying to mitterate upon, and recover another rug, hopefully one that can match the old rug's ability to really tie the room together. Meeting with contempt and hostility from the Big Lebowski, the Dude eventually finagles a rug from the real Jeffery Lebowski's house. This episode marks the beginning of a precarious relationship between the two Lebowskis. The Big Lebowski calls upon the Dude after the Big Lebowski receives a ransom note stating that the love of his life, Bunny Lebowski, has been kidnapped. From here, the movie takes twists and turns as the Dude acts as courier of the ransom money and finds himself center stage in the whole kidnapping fiasco, mainly because he is in a unique position to either confirm or deny the carpet pissers as the identity of the kidnappers. As the movie culminates, the two Lebowskis have a final bout, exposing the true nature of each. Without wasting millions of dollars on special effects to fill in for thin plot lines and fluff for weak scenes and content, the Cohen Brothers displayed their prowess through manipulating language and intelligently designing one of the best movies ever produced. Every time I watch this movie, I find something that I previously missed. The Big Lebowski firmly cements the Cohen Brothers as Hollywood stalwarts in the movie industry.",The Big Lebowski

1102,saqmandu,Watch it a few times before you judge it,10,10 May 2004,"Like many other lovers of The Big Lebowski, I was baffled by this movie and didn't really care for it all that much after the first viewing, and didn't realize what a fantastic piece of work it was until I watched it again late one night on USA network while rocking a new born baby to sleep. Despite the edits and commercial interruptions, everything fell into place for me and I rented it again and watched it over and over, each time finding something new and wonderfully funny. I now own it on DVD and watch it at least once a month. And it just gets funnier each time.First of all, I'm surprised that I have never seen anyone notice that this movie is the Coens fractured version of a modern day Western. The tumblin tumbleweed, the cowboy music, and Sam Elliot's narrative at the beginning should have been a huge tip off. In addition, the structure of this movie broadly mirrors that of John Ford's classic horse opera ""The Searchers,"" though many of the elements are inverted. Most Westerns have a hero who is an outsider who only wants what is rightfully his (in The Big Lebowski, the Dude is a social misfit who just wants his rug back). Like the girl who was kidnapped by Native Americans in ""The Searchers,"" this movie has a girl who has been purportedly abducted by a group foreign to the settled community (German Nihilists). And like every western movie, there is a violent showdown at the end, though most westerns don't have a showdown anywhere near as funny (""Dipsh** with a Nine-toed Woman!...Anti-Semite"").But its not the amateur film school analysis that makes this movie great, its the acting, the characters, the dialogue, and the many twists and turns that are tied up at the end.The dialogue is richly funny, though you have to watch the movie several times to catch everything said, since the characters are constantly interrupting one another and trying to talk over each other. I think this is one reason that people who have only seen this movie once didn't like it. The humor in what the Dude, Donny, and Walter are saying to each other is killer, and its even funnier when you realize that none of them are really listening to each other.For those who haven't seen the movie yet, you might want to remember this. If you see it and don't think the movie makes any sense, remember that many people who love this movie didn't ""get it"" either the first time around.",The Big Lebowski

1105,myerbt,"Don't Try To ""Tie It All Together""",10,3 August 2012,"Its two separate subplots. Biggest mistake people make is trying to ""tie it all together"" with one single, rug-like theme.Plot 1. As the Coen's have often admitted, they were using Chandler's Big Sleep as their first model. A meaningless, complex, twisty, noir mystery as the main plot, while adding other subtle little messages. Here, its like a copy of Lynch's Blue Velvet, which shows that the simplicity and innocence of small towns (like Fargo) or 50's America (i.e. the Bowling Alley) are long gone, and if you poke your innocent nose into the mystery of the hidden underbelly of society (organized greed, deception, violence, etc), you are going to get hurt by it (which the Dude was). Lessons: just let it go. Curiosity killed the cat. Revenge isn't worth it. Stay above all the dirty behaviors that run modern society. The Age of Innocence is over.Plot 2. LBJ's famous 1965 quote to the Canadian prime minister who criticized American policy in Vietnam (""you came into my living room and p*ssed on my rug"") is the starting point here. Like Walter (John Goodman), a group of Vietnam-era grudge-holders (Cheney, Rumsfeld, Perle, others) waited 30 years to find some clueless, stoned, knuckle-headed 'dude' (Bush Jr) they could manipulate into ""redeeming"" the honor of the US by not allowing our nation to be pushed around on the world stage (""this aggression will not stand""). Bush Jr, working on a whole other agenda, was seeking more personal, rug-like revenge for his ""dad"" who was supposedly humiliated by not destroying Saddam and Iraq in Gulf War I. Walter and Dude also had totally different agendas here, but toward the same outcome. Lessons: pride will get you in trouble. The past is the past. Revenge isn't worth it. Vietnam is over-let it go, or risk crippling the US economy by focusing so much on global p*ssing contests while everyone else is making stuff. Blissful, post-war 50's America is all gone now, but maybe some of us can just go back to bowling and live a simple life.Lots of other little interesting comments in here about Nixon's love of bowling, religion, nihilism, etc., are just that: symbolic commentary about the world. There is no bigger meaning there.Young people ask: How did this all happen? President Dwight Eisenhower warned us: if we don't pay attention, the military-industrial-congress complex (what we now call global corporations) would get too much power and wreck the country with their greed and arrogance. We didn't listen. Next time around, abide the warning.",The Big Lebowski

1108,robinasselman,A wonderful and very funny movie,10,5 February 2005,"The story of the big lebowski is as difficult as funny. It begins with a lazy man in Los Angeles who's parents named him Jef Lebowski, but he prefers if people call him ""the dude"", played magnificently by Jeff Bridges. One evening two men come into his house and confuse the dude with Jeff Lebowski, a millionaire, where they want to steal from. One of the two ""pees"" on his rug and the dude wants a new rug. That's where the trouble starts. His bowling-mates Ronny (Steve Buscemi)and Walter (John Goodman)try to help him but do more harm than good, Jeff Lebowski's wife gets kidnapped and the dude has to help her back. But is she really kidnapped, is she really his wife and what's doing Maude Lebowski(great role by Julianne Moore)in all of this? Between all this adventure they have to play a tournament and might meet the incredible Jesus (John Turturro), who is a great bowler but ""also a pervert"". The movie contains hilarious scenes and unbelievable trips and is packed with great one liners. The dude is an anti-hero who does the things his way and most of the time, that's very relaxed. It's also relaxed for us as a viewer and the dude at some way is even inspiring. Maybe the Coen brothers made with Fargo a better movie, i was caught immediately by this one and since then i seen it over and over again but i never got bored. The film is based on a friend of the Coen brothers, who called himself the dude and Jeff bridges did nothing more for to make this movie then to eat and drink.

1111,driftinbugz,The Big Lebowksi is a hilarious film that anybody who enjoys films must watch.,10,28 February 2017,"As a college student with a very busy schedule, life can be very stressful at times. For me, when I get stressed I watch films. This has been my favorite pastimes for many years and, in those years, I have seen many movies. Some of the movies have been entertaining and well made, while others have been complete failures. One film that is among the more memorable is the Coen brothers' film The Big Lebowski. This 1998 comedy is certainly one of the best, and most hilarious, films I have ever watched. The hilarious dialogue, enthralling story, and great acting are what make The Big Lebowski one of the most influential films in recent years.The dialogue is one of the most effective pieces in this film. It is certainly a film that I, and many people around me, quote frequently. One of the most memorable lines in the movie is the classic, ""The rug really tied the room together,"" (The Big Lebowski), which is repeated numerous times throughout the film. This is funny because the rug, that is so frequently mentioned, was urinated on at the very beginning of the movie and, it is the only reason why the Dude pushes on through the madness during the film. Another, and equally memorable, quote in the film is at the very end of the film when the Dude utters, ""Yeah? Well, the Dude abides,"" (The Big Lebowski). This laid back comment is so comical because the Dude has gone through so much at this point in the film, yet he is still content with the way things ended up. The memorable dialogue in The Big Lebowski is credited to the movie's brilliant writers Joel and Ethan Coen, who also directed the film.Another great component of the Coen brother's writing can be seen in the film's outrageous story. There are so many twists and turns in this movie which just adds to the hilarity of it all. The film starts with a bang when the Dude returns to his home, after grocery shopping, and is attacked by two men asking, ""Where's the money Lebowski?"" (The Big Lebowski). The comedy in this scene comes from, the Dude getting mistaken for another Jeffrey Lebowski, and being the inciting incident that throws the Dude immediately into his absurd quest for a new rug. Another hilarious part of the film is when John Goodman's character, Walter Sobchak the Vietnam War vet, destroys a Corvette he mistakenly thought was a young boys', with a crowbar, which resulted in the car's true owner smashing the Dude's car. In any movie, no matter how good the writing is, the actors must be able to deliver it in a way that is believable. In the case of The Big Lebowski, it must also be funny, and that is exactly what the actors were able to accomplish.The acting is by far the most important aspect of the entire movie. Everyone who was cast in The Big Lebowski was able to deliver every joke with great timing, yet make their character believable even though the story is so off the wall. Jeff Bridges' portrayal of the Dude could not have been better because he was able to make the absurdity going on around him completely believable. A great example of Bridges' ability to do this is in the scene where the Dude gets one of his friends ashes thrown in his face while spreading them in the ocean. What makes Jeff Bridges' acting so funny in this scene is his stoic face and almost non-existent reaction. John Goodman also did a fantastic job as Walter in this film. As his character, Goodman had to go from being completely calm, to being furious, back to acting completely calm in an instant and that's exactly what he did. The scene that Goodman demonstrates this best is when he pulls a gun on one of his friends for not marking their foul while bowling. To this day, whenever I see Bridges in a film, I immediately think of the Dude.While there are many fans of the film, it is, of course, not for everyone. The biggest complaint I have heard from the people that I have recommended the movie to has been that, while there are many surprises in it, the film doesn't really go anywhere, which is exactly what I thought the first time I watched the film. Although I do see their point, I think the reason why somebody would say something like this is because, what the Dude is trying to do is get a new rug, since the two men from the beginning of the film peed on his first one. This, to most people, is not a story worth telling or watching, but the movie is more about the Dude's journey than what he is seeking. I would recommend The Big Lebowski to anybody looking for a good laugh. The one piece of advice I would give, though, is that if you don't like it the first time give it at least one more chance, if not two chances, all the way through. Because of the film's memorable dialogue, ridiculous story, and great acting, I would give The Big Lebowski a whole hearted A+.",The Big Lebowski

I didn't find it to be that exactly, but I'll allow as there are some nice folks there. 'Course, I can't say I seen London, and I never been to France, and I ain't never seen no queen in her damn undies as the fella says. But I'll tell you what, after seeing Los Angeles and this a here story I'm about to unfold--Wall, I guess I seen something' ever' bit as stupefying' as ya'd see in any a those other places, and in English too, so I can die with a smile on my face without feeling' like the good Lord gypped me.",The Big Lebowski

For me Jeff Bridges and John Goodman should have deserved an Oscar or at least a nomination, it's not that kind of comedy which is funny and at the half of the movie the jokes start to get annoying, the whole movie keeps you entertained, at least i didn't want the movie to end. The only thing that bothered me is that they haven't done a part 2, i want to know what is going to happen to ""The Dude"" and Walter i don't really care about other characters really (That doesn't mean that the other actors weren't good) I really would love if it lasted more.10/10",The Big Lebowski
1117,cupcake_movie_goer,The Mistaken Identity of Dude.......,7,2 August 2013,"In this eccentric comedy/crime film by the Coen brothers, they created an outstanding movie. The actors/actress in the film was perfectly unified in a great way that audience could build a vision of the plot. If you can handle the graphic dialogue used and suggestive behavior this is the right movie for you. The theme of the film is Jeff ""Dude""Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) discovers he is a victim of mistaken identity. Thugs were sent to his home by Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) to recover a debit; Big Lebowski's (The Millionaire) wife owes him. Before the thugs realize they have the wrong Lebowski and that he's the ""Dude"" they urinate of his rug; leaving Dude in disgust. Dude pays BigLebowski (David Huddleston) a visit to be compensated for his rug being destroyed. Big Lebowski filled with arrogance; felt he was there looking for a hand out. Dude felt the conversation wasn't getting anywhere and decided he would take a rug from Lebowski home to be even.When Bunny (Tara Reid) disappears (Lebowski's wife); Big Lebowski contacts Dude making him an offer to be the bagman. The only thing Dude has to do is deliver the ransom money for Bunny. Dude brings Walter (John Goodman) along to make the drop. When the drop goes to pieces it creates a ricochet of others trying to reclaim the ransom money. While home listening to the soothing sounds of the bowling pins being knocked down, he discovers 3 people standing over him. They knocked him out and he begins to hallucinate; the lighting becomes dark with bright lights in the sky as he floats in sky. During the hallucination Dude see the rug he confiscated from Big Lebowski's. He is woken once his bowling ball drops him back to the surface. After coming back to reality, Dude is greeted by a women flying through the air on a stripe line in the nude, Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore). Dude and Maude forms a relationship. Dude without realizing has been sized up to be a sperm donor of her child. Dude experienced many encounters because he was trying to clear his identity. After having sex with Maude and enjoy a marijuana joint, at that moment Dude realized the reasoning behind the mistaken identity fiasco. In conclusion, as a motif in the film ""Dude"" was the main character's name; however, it was used as a common word of expression during dialogue. Dude was able to regain his identity and continued being the old lazy, laid back, unemployed, and bowler from Southern California.",The Big Lebowski

1119,eyink01,"The Big Lebowski, my hero-the slacker, crime mystery solver",9,22 September 2013,"The Big Lebowski film plot is centered on a Los Angeles dude, who is a real slacker, pot smoking, White Russian drinker, soon to be hero solving a crime mystery. He happens to have the same name as a millionaire; Jeffrey Lebowski played by David Huddleston, whose wife, Bunny Lebowski (Tara Reid) was kidnapped and owes money to a known pornographer. We are introduced to the Dude as he is shopping for milk and he opened the carton and sniffed it. The Dude wrote a check for 69 cents and returns home. It appears that he is unaware that someone is waiting on him and they attack him in the apartment. One of the hit men urinates on his rug. His prized possession that ties the apartment together, says the Dude. The Dude enlists his bowling buddies, whom we meet in regular league play. His main antagonist and best friend played by John Goodman, as Walter Sobchak. We soon learn that Walter is a practicing Jew who observes the Shabbos day of rest. Walter refuses to lift a finger on the day of rest, but manages to convince the Dude that he needs to find the millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski, and get his rug replaced. Walter drives the car on the Shabbos and says he is just doing it to help out. But turns out he is creating more trouble for the Dude. The millionaire Jeffrey Lebowski is in a wheelchair, but convinces the Dude he needs to deliver the ransom money alone so his kidnapped wife will return. The Dude becomes a crime fighting, urban cowboy. They go through the motions of delivering the money and in the meantime, they say ""F it, let's go bowling"" park the car in a handicapped zone with the ransom money in it, when they walk outside the car is gone. Panic ensues and Walter always says ""Shut the F up, Donny"" played by Steve Buscemi. Donny never really gets to say much in the film, but Walter always tells him the same thing. We get introduced to the millionaire's sister, Maude Lebowski portrayed by Julianne Moore. Maude was a nude artist who created her works of art while riding in ceiling harness. She believed the ransom money was kept by the Dude, but he proves to her that there was no money, and he was used by her brother as a scapegoat. The millionaire still has the money. The pornographer hires hit men, thugs to find the money. Once they determine there is no money, they punch the Dude in the face so hard, we see & hear fireworks, and then he is flying through the sky like Superman. Then he lands in the bowling alley. The Dude tackles all his problems inside the walls of the bowling alley. The punch perpetuates him there.Walter's character gets so out of hand he pulls a gun on another bowler because he wants to bowl on Shabbos. This is not going to happen, the police are called but they run right by the pair in the parking lot. They are not even the least bit frazzled about the police being there, we see them running into the alley with guns pulled.The music ties the scenes together in the movie. When the action elevates to a point where they can't handle it anymore, the say let's go bowling. Magically through sound they end up there bowling. Always confronted by larger than life egos and it becomes quite funny how much animosity and hate both lash at each other. One of the teams they are to play against, become real aggressive and say ""No one messes with Jesus"" (John Turturro) that is the bowler's name. We get a flashback which is so comical showing Jesus as a pedophile going door to door announcing to the neighborhood that he lives there. Music takes us from the bowling alley through that flashback. It is a funny movie showing that even slackers can be heroes. Maude found a purpose for the Dude, as she wanted him to be a sperm donor only, she wanted a child. She was beyond weird, but the Dude liked her style. At the conclusion of the film Donnie dies from shock of seeing the Dude's car on fire. He was not up for all the problems and confrontations that Walter and Dude went through. He was much more fragile than they imagined, best part is he didn't die alone. His best friends were there till the end. Many times over this movie had music transition the picture forward, the voices were covered by different rock songs, and special effects transferred everyone to the next scene. Just by mere suggestion. We were walking in the bowling alley at every problem. I loved how they glorified some of the bowling scenes, especially with the dude going underneath about 50 women down the approach looking up at their crotches. Sometimes even the Dude was embarrassed by what he wished would happen. He couldn't look up at the women he floated upside down the approach of the bowling alley, ashamed of his own thoughts or more like daydreams. The Dude became a crusader of crime, not you're likely candidate to solve a mystery. He did it with the help of Donnie and Walter, despite the constant arguing and bickering between the three. The arguing was the craziest thing that kept them going, for most it would drive them apart. I never imagined this would be a crime mystery movie that was so cleverly written that The Dude seems like someone from real life and not a character at all. He feels so real, that's what makes this movie so special. Anyone can be a hero; you just gotta believe in yourself, even if you're a slacker.",The Big Lebowski

They were not good in this awful example of a comedy either. Not really a spoiler, but, Jeff Bridges finally figures out what is going on with the other, main Lebowski and confronts him at the end. Also not funny. The whole movie is not that funny for listing this as a comedy. I'm sorry I wasted my time watching and am writing this so others don't waste theirs. I think I may have laughed once, if that. Also, in IMDb movie synopsis it states that there were two people pissing on his rug. There were not. It was just one of the thugs doing the pissing.

1123,krishnaaiyar,Nice Movie,10,25 November 2013,"The story line is great.This comic update of the world crystallised by Raymond Chandler charts the disastrous involvement of laidback dope-head Jeff 'the Dude' Lebowski (Bridges) in a kidnapping case involving the wife of his millionaire namesake (Huddleston). The Dude is hired as bagman and of course finds himself increasingly at risk as he makes his way about an LA populated by the rich, strange and dangerous. Nor do his bowling buddies help: Donny (Buscemi) is frankly several pins short of a strike; while Walter (Goodman), a crazed, irascible Viet vet, is so determined to stand his (and the Dude's) ground that he causes more trouble than he solves. Immensely inventive and entertaining, the film may not have the enigmatic elegance or emotional resonance of Barton Fink or Fargo, but it's still a prime example of the Coens' effortless brand of stylistic and storytelling brilliance. Thanks to Roger Deakins' gleaming camera-work, T-Bone Burnett's eclectic soundtrack selection and the Coens' typically pithy dialogue, it looks and sounds wonderful. Moreover, far from being shallow pastiche, it's actually about something: what it means to be a man, to be a friend, and to be a 'hero' for a particular time and place.",The Big Lebowski

Not a lot of people see this movie, which is sad because The Big Lebowski has everything. It has crime, comedy, drama, and bowling. And boy, does it have some quotes. The Big Lebowski has so many quotes, that the script is basically just one long quote. It starts off with a stoner, The Dude, coming home to his crappy apartment from the groceries store, and he finds two thugs who promptly shove his head in the toilet and demand money, stating that The Dude is a millionaire. When The Dude says that it's pretty obvious that he isn't a millionaire, they pee on his rug, which really tied the room together.I know it's not on Netflix yet, but it is totally worth the price to buy it. I've seen it over 15 times, and it still hasn't gotten the least bit old. In fact, it had only gotten better. The first time I saw it, I hated it.

1128,jackcrowley1987,The Dude Sort of Abides,7,19 June 2014,"Spoiler alert: Some plot outcomes revealed.The Dude abides, but Sam Elliot rules. Jeff Bridges is classic as the former, a pot-smoking do-nothing seeking payback for a urine-doused rug. The latter plays a mysterious cowboy-like character who chides Bridges' hapless bowler about his language but likes his style. Elliot is The Stranger. The movie's theme is mistaken identity, the effect of drugs on less- than-normal people, and how clueless rich people can truly be. The flavor, flow and overall senseless meaning of the movie underscores what happens when you portray goofs and drug-users in conflict with money- minded wackos.The shock-and-awe factor of this movie is not unlike Bad Grandpa, a 2013 send-up of a horny old grandfather featuring the star of Cable TV's Jackass show. Both movies are disjointed, purposefully themed to be off the wall, and are surprisingly funny. In The Big Lebowski, Jeffrey Lebowski is a ne'er-do-well Los Angeles bowler who hangs out with his com-padre ""kegglers,"" Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny, formally Theodore Donald Karabatsos (aka Steve Buscemi). Donny's an often-insightful dweeb who dies near movie's end. Walter's an angry, sort-of-Jewish convert who at one point produces a Colt .45 semi-automatic pistol from his bowling bag. You quickly realize none of these guys are playing with a full deck.The Dude's brain is pot-fogged and White Russian soaked. Walter, at least, is capable enough to drive, but he mistakenly thinks he fought in Vietnam. And later he collects the then-deceased Donny's ashes in a coffee can, casting them into the wind near movie's end – and back on The Dude and him.Sad to say The Dude Lebowski is mistaken by porno-movie collection apes for a very wealthy man by the same name. That would be The Big Lebowski, a condescending seeming 1-percenter yet handicapped war vet. He's played by character actor David Huddleston. Well-selected as his sycophantic servant Brandt is the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The urine on The Dude Lebowski's apartment rug is dispersed evilly by a couple arm-twisting thugs owed money by the Big Lebowski's bimbo trophy wife. The Dude is angry, and goes to see his wealthy name-sharer seeking a new rug, or more correctly a handout for the wrongful retribution. Only in America would such a chance meeting end up in a job offer. Bunny Lebowski's (Tara Reid)being held for big money, but not really. Dude accepts the mission, recruiting his pals. It truly is Bunny the wife who owes the porno mobsters money, not the wheelchair-bound war-hero millionaire Lebowski. The Dude is tasked with paying ransom for Bunny, Big Lebowski's wayward and carefree wife. Along comes Donny and Walter for the ride, Goodman's guy complete with his skewed world view and free-floating hostility. You know Big Lebowski's trophy wife is out of the kidnap plot when you see that one of the abductors is dumb enough to whack off a toe to add urgency to the fake scheme. The three supposed heroes-turned-bag-men interrupt their bowling ""career"" to save Bunny. This includes a pin-slaying showdown between The Dude and Jesus Quantana (John Turturro). You know these dueling bowlers will meet again when Jesus implies that he will beat The Dude so badly that it will be like a forceful administration of anal sex.Why? It's the whole prevalent drugs meets greed and silliness theme driven home with an 8-pound figurative sledgehammer. Portions of this movie are too bizarre to believe. (That's why I mentioned Sam Elliott, who rarely gets credit.) There's even an old-time psychedelic-rock interlude by Kenny Rogers and the First Edition: ""I Just Dropped In To See What Condition My Condition Was In."" The song plays as the Dude floats down a dream-state bowling alley while spinning rotisserie style. He passes admiringly beneath the legs of skirted identically dressed comely females. No clear reason or plot tie. It's just done. The angles, camera perspectives and even dialog are intended to underscore a pot-hazed plot. The Dude looks up from the floor at several points, flops over a chair in The Big Lebowski's office, and slurps White Russians. Walter has wild ideas about conspiracies. And Donny is always quieted with the same idiotic refrain: ""Shut the F-- up, Donny."" The Stranger says he likes The Dude's style, yet he also assails the White Russian-fueled Lebowski for a potty mouth. Say what? Head on camera shots, and Elliot's serious demeanor, add to the zany disconnected nature that prevails throughout as the movie's cult-fan theme. So does the quirkiness of all the other actors, especially Walter. Several times he has to be reminded that, no, he wasn't in Vietnam.  And Donny's rodent-like appearance lends credence to Buscemi's character.Near film's end, The Dude ends up in bed with a porn-movie producer and actress intent on becoming impregnated with his baby. Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) is an acrobatic little minx whose relationship to any other Lebowski seems unclear. The Big Lebowski is a movie with great potential, as long as you don't take any of it too seriously. Because the point is: Life is short, don't over-analyze it, and enjoy. The Dude, as each of us, merely abides.",The Big Lebowski

1131,bates22-188-933160,Film Review,9,19 December 2014,"It is easy to forget that The Big Lebowski is a mystery, like the Coen brothers' previous hit, Fargo. Where Fargo is dark, The Big Lebowski is a parody. Hidden in the jokes, satire, idiosyncratic characters, and musical numbers, the story is about a hippie ""bum,"" geniusly portrayed by Jeff Bridges, who is unwittingly sucked into becoming a pawn in kidnapping and embezzling scams. As the narrator, The Stranger (Sam Eliot) roundaboutly puts it, ""Sometimes there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes there's a man. And I'm talking' about the Dude here--sometimes there's a man who, wal, he's the man for his time'n place, he fits right in there--and that's the Dude"" (The Big Lebowski). In some ways a monomyth, The Dude takes us on an anti-hero's journey. The Dude's legal name happens to be the same as a bigwig whose trophy bride and former porn star, Bunny (Tara Reed), owes money to a porn producer, Jackie Treehorn. The producer's goons confuse the two Jeffrey Lebowskis and micturate on the Dude's room-tying-together rug. This sets off a chain of events that begins with The Dude seeking reparations from the Big Lebowski (David Huddleston) on the advice of his bowling buddies Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). This leads into him becoming the wealthier Lebowski's patsy in his plot to embezzle funds from his wife's foundation, because the Big Lebowski replaces his wife's ransom money with a ringer, intending to frame The Dude for its loss. The Dude ultimately and unwittingly undermines the scheme by solving the mystery after determining that they had ""replaced the ringer with a ringer."" He further subverts The Big Lebowski by knocking up his only daughter, Maude (Julianne Moore). A major theme of The Big Lebowski is masculinity, its stereotypes, and their deconstruction. The Big Lebowski analyzes his masculinity, asking The Dude, ""What makes a man? Is it. . . is it, being prepared to do the right thing? Whatever the price? Isn't that what makes a man?"" To which, The Dude quips, ""Sure, that and a pair of testicles."" The motif of masculine stereotypes is repeated throughout the film and each character the Dude encounters on his journey is a different stereotype, even caricature, of manliness, most of which are expertly subverted. Jeffrey ""The Big"" Lebowski appears wealthy and powerful, but is physically confined to a wheelchair and we learn that the money belonged to his wife and is wrapped up in a charitable foundation, so he actually has relatively little control. His bark is significantly worse than his bite. Brant (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is educated with what is potentially a high-powered position, yet is a sycophantic flunky. You can almost see his tail tucked between his legs. Walter is a trigger-happy, ultra-militaristic war hero, stuck in the Vietnam era. He destroys a shiny, new Corvette with a baseball bat while shouting, ""This is what you get when you f*** a stranger in the ass."" The Jesus is a hyper-sexualized, pederast, who literally licks a ball during his introduction. The Stranger is a Cowboy. Jackie Treehorn is a wealthy pornographer, surrounded by scantily-clad women. Karl Hungus/Dieter/Lead Nihilist is Bunny's porn costar, and his fellow nihilists/pretend-nappers are over-the-top aggressive and obsessively attempting to castrate The Dude. The only two female characters are also a mishmash of stereotypes. Bunny is a porn star, trophy wife, farm girl, and runaway. Maude is a privileged, educated, feminist and creator of ""strongly vaginal"" artwork. She tests The Dude's masculinity by saying ""vagina"" and several synonyms in an attempt to unnerve him.",The Big Lebowski

Now I know you can say the same thing about other Coen brother film or any film for that matter, but for me the snowy wasteland of Fargo, North Dakota and the suburban by day neon by night oasis of Los Angeles really make the films what they are (and in my perspective masterpieces!). Jeff Bridges famously plays his role to near perfection and in my opinion makes all of his other roles obsolete.

To top it off, the humor was crude, tasteless, and just plain unfunny. I didn't laugh even once for a movie deemed a ""comedy"". Stay as far away as possible all of you!Such a sad waste of two hours of my life I can never get back. . .",The Big Lebowski
1138,s_mathias,Class Review,9,19 September 2015,"""The Big Lebowski"" was a wonderful film about life's struggles through the eyes of a ""cool"" slacker. The plot steers us through a network of rich people problems to the harsh reality of life and death. Jeff Bridges plays the role of ""The Dude"" absolutely perfectly. The Dude gets entangled in a twisted kidnap/ransom plot that introduces a wide variety of personalities. Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) adds energy to the conflict with his crazy rash behavior. Walter's nutty actions help to reinforce The Dude as the position of reason. his's antics drive the ransom scenes and help insert excitement into a meaningless sequence. Walter and The Dude escalate the situation by not completely following the kidnapper's directions. The situation snowballs as the truth is slowly revealed. Donny (Steve Buscemi) does little to influence the plot and is included mainly as comic relief for the first part of the movie. His conversations seem distance and irrelevant, but in the end, his character helps to ground the story and remind of us what really matters in this world. Maude Lebowski (Julianne Moore) introduces herself to the situation and gives us some insight about the kidnapping. Maude is used in this film to convey information about her father, The Big Lebowski, played by David Huddleston. Although her role is very helpful, her demeanor and snooty personality distracts and pulls attention from the flow of the theme. As I watched this great film, I felt this sequence could have been routed a bit differently to help the plot instead of hinder it. The German's added a good amount of comic relief as their characters helped to tie the whole kidnapping ploy together. The Nihilist's added another dimension to this theme that was meant to make light of the whole abduction. This film has a lot in common with the movie ""Raising Arizona"". Both films revolve around attempts to extort the rich for money, while outlasting crazy and funny events. Both films become grounded in the end by life and death. The lighting in the ransom delivery sequence was extremely appropriate and seemed to mimic the typical suspenseful car ride. The music and even the color of Walter's glasses help to add to the adventurous feeling we were intended to experience in this scene. The shot angles during the bowling scenes definitely helped the music to calm our emotions from the conflicts of the kidnapping and peacefully install us back into the mind of The Dude. I absolutely loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone with an open mind. This crazy adventure has a little bit of everything exciting, sex drugs and rock and roll, but also remains grounded, expressing the trials of life and death.",The Big Lebowski
1139,katiethewriter,Horrible movie,1,7 March 2006,"I honestly don't understand how this movie is so popular. I wanted to watch it to see what all the fuss was about, and I barely made it through an hour of the movie. I laughed a grand total of once in the entire time, and that was within the first five minutes. It's slow, stupid, and has little to no value.(POSSIBLE SPOILER?) The only ""redeeming"" scene is apparently a fantasy scene involving Julianne Moore's character and bowling, but I couldn't stomach watching any more of the movie for the sole purpose of seeing this scene. It was a waste of my time and money. I highly recommend NOT watching this movie. It's really not that big a loss, even if it is one of IMDb's top 250 movies. It's not worth the bother.",The Big Lebowski
1140,sebafreille,Your revolution is over Mr. Lebowski!,9,20 November 2006,"I've lost count of how many times I've seen this film and each time it seems to get better and better. Yet, the first time I saw this film I didn't think it was a great movie since I didn't realize the true greatness of it (in fact, I think no one did). This is because the movie is not about the plot or about the message. This movie is great because of its characters, dialogue and aesthetics, things that are most appreciated with successive viewings. It's the little details that will make this your favourite comedy of all time.Jeff Bridges, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi are outstanding as the three bowling buddies and excellently supported by Philip Seymour Hoffman and Julianne Moore. In fact I think most would agree that Jeff Bridges and especially John Goodman gave award-winning performances. The dialogue is truly amazing. I mean how many movies are bestowed with so many memorable lines as this one? It is also truly unique. For a good-hearted and laid-back sort of film, to contain that many and different subtle references to cultural idiosyncrasies really says something. Finally, and I think this is what gives the movie defining cult status, it's the aesthetics. You can tell the effort made by directors and actors alike in carefully constructing each character. Each character has been embedded with a particular style and ethos which explain their way of going about things. Each character is both cause and effect of different generational prototypes mingling with each other in that psychedelic fauna that is The Big Lebowski.",The Big Lebowski
1141,overal,The Dude finds himself in over his head after a millionaire with the same name hires him to do a job for him.,9,13 December 2015,"The Big Lebowski centers around ""The Dude"" wonderfully played by Jeff Bridges, who finds himself (and his rug) on the wrong end of a mistaken Identity caper. He is offered a job from another ""Lebowski"" (a millionaire played by David Huddlestone) to be a courier for the millionaire Lebowski and enlists his two friends Donny (Steve Buscemi) and Walter (John Goodman) a former Viet Nam veteran for help. After a series of unfortunate events, The Dude and his friends find themselves in over their heads, and The Dude may be on the line for much more than he ever asked for. The themes of this film seems to center around misinformation, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and manipulation. Everything about the film seems like it was devised by The Big Lebowski, or is the result of misinformation and being at the wrong place at the wrong time. The plan by The Big Lebowski seems to have already at least have been thought of, if not already in motion by the time The Dude shows up at his mansion demanding compensation for the rug that was urinated on by the thugs trying to collect a debt from The Big Lebowski. The Dude is then coerced into a plan that has him running dangerous errands and meeting all kinds of sketchy characters that he probably would never have run into if it weren't for the unfortunate timing and bad luck of this mistaken identify case.The Coen brothers do a masterful job of mixed witty and hilarious dialogue with suspense and action. All of their films, this one included, feel like a work of art as opposed to a big budget comedy romp. The editing, lighting, and soundtrack really enhance and contribute on their own right to making this film as great as it is. The soundtrack perfectly balances between The Dudes hazy lifestyle to opera like signing while a party-goer at Jacky Treehorn's home is thrown into the air in slow-motion on a trampoline. The theme of this film has parallels to other films by the Coen brothers, for example in the film No Country For Old Men, the lead character Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a crime scene one night while out hunting. Being at the wrong place at the wrong time leads Llewelyn down a dark path and finds himself running for his life throughout the film. The Big Lebowski deserves to be talked about as one of the best Coen brothers films to date. It has a complex and twisting plot that allows for multiple viewings without boredom, an all star cast who each masterful carve out their characters in a humorous yet compelling style, and the direction and writing from the Coen's is top notch and will have audiences quoting The Dude for many years ahead.",The Big Lebowski
1142,widespreadpanicphan,the plane has crashed into the side of the mountain,10,24 July 2005,"The Big Lebowski is an epic film that has ""strikes and gutter-balls...ups and downs."" The cast is spectacular. There are many stars that appear in this film. Jeff Bridges does a great job playing the wonderfully lazy: The Dude. John Goodman is very funny as high tempered Vietnam vet. And Steve Buscemi's character, Donny, is very funny as the innocent victim of Goodman's temper. I can not picture any other actors playing these characters, or the other characters for that matter. The Big Lebowski has an excellent plot, something that most comedies seem to lack. This is a must see movie that will have you repeating some quotes from the film to your friends on a regular basis.

Since then the Movie has generated itself to a cult classic and for some good reasons. The Story is a typical Coen Brother story but still stay's original. The cast did tremendous job representing the characters written for the screen. Jeff Bridges rubbing his eyes before The Dude was high in some scenes or John Goodmans nailing performance as a sort of John Milius look-a-like. The iconic outfits that you can buy on Amazon for Halloween.And since I saw the movie for the first time, I always after watching it get the need to mix myself a White Russian and listen to Kenny Rogers' Just Dropped In.

1146,simon-30655,The Big Lebowski review,9,27 July 2016,"The main story of this film opens up with Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) having his rug urinated on. The cause of this unfortunate event was a mix-up by the thugs, as ""The Dude"" Jeff Lebowski shares a name with a millionaire Jeff Lebowski (David Huddleston). This prompts The Dude to go over to The Big Lebowski and demand compensation for the rug. This leads to The Big Lebowski having The Dude be his courier to deliver ransom money when his wife gets kidnapped. The ransom drop goes awry when Walter (John Goodman) gets involved, which lead to the whole somewhat convoluted chain of events in the rest of the film.One of the major themes of the film is The Dude pacifism. What makes the film interesting is that while he is a pacifist, he spends the majority of the film being angry. However, you can always see his laid-back peaceful personality underneath everything. When the thugs broke into his apartment in the beginning of the movie, one of them water boarded him in his own toilet. However, when he talks about it with Walter the next day, he does not even mention being water boarded. He's just upset about the loss of his rug. We also see this later in the film, when his second rug is stolen. When he meets Maude (Julianne Moore), who was the person who stole the rug, they have a long conversation, with the rug being mentioned several times. At the end of the conversation, Maude apologizes for having him punched in the jaw. He replies, ""Oh, that's fine. That doesn't even..."" When she insists he see the doctor, he says, ""That's thoughtful but..."" He doesn't care about being beaten, he just wants a rug.The editing and camera angles in the film are simple and direct. With few exceptions, there are no real fancy editing effects or transitions. The only time there are any fancy effects in the film are in dream sequences. Additionally, the colors of the film, especially The Dude's clothes, are simple and muted. This represents The Dude's simple, laid-back attitude on life.Overall, The Big Lebowski is a great film. The characters in the movie all have their own personality and backstory, and that makes the whole film feel alive. The dialog is engaging, especially with everyone's personality being in contrast with The Dude's. After seeing it for the first time, this is already one of my favorite films.",The Big Lebowski
1147,sebrosius,...sometimes there's a man.,10,9 June 2017,"To me this movies is about a man who is complete, he is happy: has a hobby that is a love of his life, has friends that love his hobby as well, and has enough money for gas, and oh, did I mention a rug that really ties the room together. But to me this movie is about all of that and yet none of that. Its a movie about being happy with who you are and not letting others tell you how to be happy. During the first run of this film I say it 50+ times in the the theater, during lunch I would go see 15-30 minutes of it, after work I would see it twice. And this was the time period in cinema movies would stay in the theater for months, sometimes almost a year. So I have plenty of chances to see it.

1151,kittfresa,A stoned bum is thrown into a strange kidnapping case and he is tasked with being a key component in getting back the kidnapped.,9,19 April 2017,"The Big Lebowski is really it's own kind of film. It's characters are all strange but yet seem to fit in perfectly. There seems to be no line drawn in the sand to limit The Big Lebowski's creativity and bizarreness. Its main character alone has been such a draw that he has been the source of a new religion; Dudeism. The directors of The Big Lebowski, the Coen Brothers, are known for their unique filmography and outside-the-box thinking, but The Big Lebowski is certainly one of the movies that granted them that title.We begin our journey from the outside, starting with The Stranger. An old cowboy who already knows The Dude himself (Jeff Bridges). The Stranger acts as a character, narrator and audience member all at the same time. He talks tall tales about The Dude, and we are promptly dropped into his world. The Dude roams around L.A. and bowls in his free time, always scavenging for his next White Russian and couch to kick back on. The Dude walks back home one day only to find two henchmen waiting for him. One throws The Dude's head in his own gross toilet and the other unzips his pants and pees on his rug. It really tied the room together. One henchmen goes on to explain that the two are there to extort money from The Dude, calling him ""Mr Lebowski."" Only, they've got the wrong Lebowski. The two leave in an aggressive embarrassment and The Dude is left on his bathroom floor with a toilet-water-soaked head and sunglasses on.The Dude does some digging and eventually finds the real Mr. Lebowski in an attempt to get some money to replace his rug. The two meet in Mr. Lebowski's illustrious house, and The Dude leaves without any money but having tricked Mr. Lebowski's personal assistant, Brandt, into stealing a rug for him. As The Dude leaves he winds up chatting up Mr. Lebowski's trophy wife, Bunnie, as well.The Dude is a toker for sure. Always kicking back and lighting some J's, he proves himself to be The Dude time and time again. The Dude's casual mindset pairs well with his habit of smoking weed and in a good amount of scenes he is. However it's almost like he goes unchanged. There isn't a sober dude and there isn't a high Dude he just is, The Dude. It's the appearance of what The Dude is that makes him what he is, and weed is a strong component of that. Without the J, The Dude wouldn't be the same dude.The Dude goes back off into his exceedingly casual life and bowls with his teammates, Walter Sobchak (John Goodman) and Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). However, not too long afterwards, The Dude receives an urgent voicemail left by Brandt requesting that The Dude come and visit, and it's not about the rug. Mr. Lebowski's wife, Bonnie, has been kidnapped for ransom. Mr. Lebowski and Brandt see The Dude as being in a unique position because they believe the men who captured Bunnie may also be the same culprits who ""soiled"" The Dude's rug. The Dude abides, and the rest is a crazy hilarious journey. It's like The Usual Suspects meets The Naked Gun. Jeff Bridge's performance as The Dude is one of the most recognizable in Hollywood. Him and a litany of other cast members won awards for their unique and charismatic performances. The acting is from another world, the characters are the strangest in the world, but all need each other to exist. It's almost a hallucinatory movie. The Big Lebowski is a must see for any movie fan and is sure to crack a few laughs and spark lots of curiosity. There's no better time to enjoy the turbulent journey of The Dude than now. The Big Lebowski is best served with a White Russian.",The Big Lebowski
1152,s_rishe,"rude and crude, and i love it",10,25 October 2005,"Yes, it is rude and crude. But that doesn't mean it isn't hilarious. The writing is brilliant, especially if you've seen or even read The Maltese Falcon. The directing is also great, provided by the Coen Brothers, who brought us Fargo. But the high point of the movie is definitely the acting. Jeff Bridges is the dude. It is a believable part and most importantly hilarious. He does it all, the laziness, the swearing, the acid trips. Steve Buscemi, also from Fargo, is great as Donny. His dialog, though few and far between, complements the dialog of the Dude and Walter. Which brings us to Walter, as played by John Goodman. I'm not sure who swears more, Walter or the Dude, but I would put my money on Walter. The point it is Walter who fulfills every stereotype you've heard about this movie. The rudeness, the nonsense, the lack of coherence, etc. Of course there are numerous supporting parts as well, the Big Lebowski, Jesus, etc. that only add to the film. In the end, if you love movies like Spaceballs and Bad Santa, you'll love this. If not, at least give it a chance and keep an open mind.",The Big Lebowski
1153,david-78341,The Dude,10,16 September 2017,"Have you been looking for a movie that really ties the room together? If so, The Big Lebowski is just that movie! Warning, spoiler alert!!! This movie starts out when Jeff Lebowski's, AKA the Dude (Jeff Bridges) house gets broken into by two assailants demanding money. The assailants soon learn they have the wrong Lebowski and one of them angrily urinates on the dudes' rug. The Dude, angry that his favorite rug that really tied the room together was urinated on, consults his bowling partner Walter Sobchok (John Goodman). Walter instructs the Dude that he needs to find the correct Jeff Lebowski and have him compensate him for the fouled rug. The Dude heeding Walter's instructions does just that. Upon meeting the real Jeff Lebowski, the Dude gets inadvertently involved in the kidnapping plot of Mr. Lebowski's wife Bunny (Tara Reid). Mr. Lebowski offers the Dude 25K to be the bag man and drop the ransom off to the kidnappers. The Dude then tells his bowling partner Walter, who invites himself along to perform the drop. Walter switches the ransom money with his dirty undies ""the whites"" and they perform the drop. The ransom money is then stolen out of the dude's trunk and he finds himself between a rock and a hard place. The kidnappers report that they did not receive the ransom so now the Dude is assailed upon by not only Mr. Lebowski but the kidnappers as well. The Dude and Walter ultimately find out that that Bunny ran away and wasn't kidnapped. They also discover that Mr. Lebowski stuffed the ransom bag with telephone books in hopes that the kidnappers would kill Bunny who was a gold digger that cheated on him. The theme of this film is? You guessed it, the Dude. The dude is an unemployed, burned out bum. He gets assaulted, he's tortured, his rug gets soiled on and his car is systematically destroyed throughout this film. He is seduced by a rich woman who uses him for her pregnancy needs. He has the chance to earn a fortune only to have it slip away. Despite all this the Dude remains very dude like! He takes on all this adversity and challenge with his calm easy- going demeanor. In the end, the dude is essentially where he began before all this strife and drama entered his life. None of this seems to bother the dude and this is why I love this film so much! The Coen brothers are amazing writers and I believe this to be their best work to date! Another film they wrote called Inside Llewn Davis had a very similar theme to the Big Lebowski. Inside Llewn Davis was about a struggling folk musician whose music partner kills himself. Llewn Davis' (Oscar Issac) record doesn't sell. He survives by sleeping on various friend's couches, one of whom he ends up impregnating his girlfriend. He takes a recording gig to be able to earn enough money to pay for his friend's girlfriend's abortion. Throughout all this adversity Llewn Davis like the Dude has a calm and easy-going demeanor and basically ends up where he began minus his record starting to take off. The use of voice-over narration and the thematic element of focusing on the character lend a lot to why this movie has taken on the cult following that it has. The voice- over narration helps to introduce us to the Dude from the beginning of this film. The stranger that narrates also points out the struggles that the Dude suffers throughout this film as well as highlight that the Dude keeps his calm. The narrator ends the movie by comforting us and letting us know that everything works out for the Dude. The thematic element of focusing on the Dude is what drives this movie. The plot is important to this film but without the Dude there would be no plot. That being said, this movies' plot is driven by the lead characters actions. The qualities that set the Dude apart from ordinary people is his ability to remain calm despite all the chaos that surrounds him. The theme of this film can be absolutely expressed in the description of the dude. If you've been looking for a good movie that really ties the room together then this is a must see! The Big Lebowski shows us that an easy-going demeanor and calmer than you are approach is the way to approach life. This movie is ensured to bring you a great film viewing experience.",The Big Lebowski

1162,skycybersoldier,The film with the highest rewatch factor of all time.,10,10 April 2021,"It's actually kind of hard to describe this movie (and what's so great about it) to people who don't already know it and love it; as with many cult films, The Big Lebowski will either speak to you (in which case you will become a fervent follower of His Dudeness and abide by his code for the rest of your life) or, if it doesn't, the film will either leave you completely indifferent or you'll even downright hate it.I believe it's a very funny film and I'm sure it can be rightfully called a comedy, but don't expect punchlines, gags, jokes or slapstick - it's not that kind of comedy. If you want to enjoy this film, you have to meet Jeffery ""The Dude"" Lebowski on his terms, hang out with him and his bowling buddies and follow them at a their (perhaps somewhat leisurely) pace through this weird and unbelievable tale about nihilism, theft (of a car and, more importantly: a Creedence Clearwater Revival tape), kidnapping, abstract art, porn and - of course - bowling.The story is actually kind of simple. You see, some no-good German nihilists urinated on The Dude's rug - and this kind of aggression just won't stand against The Dude. With the help of his bowling buddies, he will do everything in his power to get someone to pay for his rug - or possibly get a new one (because that rug really tied the room together). So he embarks on this worthy quest during which he will encounter many wondrous things and fascinating people (even Jesus - who is NOT the messiah but a very naughty man).With Jeff Bridges in the leading role, the Coen brothers have found the perfect actor to incorporate one of the most iconic characters that has ever been created. But it's not just The Dude that makes this a winner; the whole film is such an inspired folly and simply inventive filmmaking at its finest (the hilarious dream sequence alone is worth the price of admission). The supporting cast is outstanding (J. Turturro, J. Goodman and S. Buscemi among many others), the song choices are perfect and the dialog is the funniest, most quotable in any comedy I've ever seen. This - for me - is without a doubt the film with the highest rewatchability factor of all time. 10 stars out of 10.",The Big Lebowski

If you want something to watch with the wife/gf this isn't for you. If you want something obvious or mainstream this isn't for you. If you care about plots, suspense etc. this isn't going to be your cup of tea. The people I know that like this film tend to be film connoisseurs, intellectual males, peaceful, well balanced individuals. The Coen Brothers went all out on this film. Every member of the cast made the performance of their career in this film, the cinematography is fantastic, there are so many scenes to be seen, the soundtrack is brilliant etc. etc. but what this film is all about is the dialogue. If you're a fan of films like Pulp Fiction and Fight Club where it's the excellent dialogue that brings you back then this is the ultimate film for you.I watched this by myself on a movie channel around the time of its release and a couple of years later when my younger brother told me to watch this film I couldn't remember a thing about it. I gave it another watch and half enjoyed it. My brother convinced me to watch it again so I did. This time I loved it and by the time I'd seen it 4 times it became my favourite film of all time.
After 3-4 viewings you think Jeff Bridges' 'Dude' character is the greatest movie character of all time and that he should have won an Oscar.

1164,lauramartin-65447,Seriously overrated waste of time.,1,17 September 2018,"I love so many of the actors in this film and was really looking forward to seeing The Big Lebowski for the first time.After just watching it with such great expectations, I'm left seriously wondering what the heck is wrong with people? 
This movie was a waste of an amazing cast. This movie goes absolutely no where and is just a bunch of random, ridiculous, incoherent and implausible scenarios lazily strung together on a weak gimmick of a storyline. I really wanted to like this movie but it was just awful.",The Big Lebowski
1165,ng-38562,The most memorable characters of any movie I've seen,10,25 September 2018,"Whenever I try to explain The Big Lebowski to someone, I tell them that the film is 25% plot and 75% characters. While that is a cursory explanation and neglects setting as a rather large portion, I think it well portrays the priorities and attitude of the film.
 To be sure, the plot is still well crafted and exciting. It is an easily flowing story of misunderstanding, kidnapping, and deception. And it manages all three topics without a dark theme by telling it through the eyes of an unmotivated and nonchalant hippie. But the film is far more than just a plot.
 After watching it the first time, I realized that many of the scenes and dialogues could be completely omitted and the plot would still make sense. Walter bringing his wife's Pomeranian to the bowling game, as well as his constant reference to his service in the Vietnam war, and the scene where The Dude attends his landlord's dance recital, none of these contribute to the plot at all, but contribute much to character and setting development. And they are so effective that no one could really care about the extra length. They make the characters funny and memorable, and the film as such. 
 One example scene where The Dude first meets Maude, shows how the Coen brothers squeeze as much theme development as they can out of a scene. In this scene, Maude tells The Dude about Bunny and how the kidnapping is likely staged. They could have had The Dude respond to Maude's statements and conversation, as a normal scene would play out. But instead they have The Dude constantly interjecting to ask about his rug, while Maude ignores him and carries out a one-sided conversation. Doing so preserves the spacey, aloof nature of The Dude's personality, and showcases Maude's persistent and independent character, all while giving the scene a comedic mood.
 The film presses the contrasting characters of The Dude and Walter together constantly as well. Their differences - The Dude being an easy-going pacifist and Walter being an impulsive, sometimes aggressive War Vet - bring out the hilarity in both characters. They are constantly arguing, and The Dude often regrets everything that Walter brings him into (such as Walter's involvement in the hand off or Walter clubbing a stranger's sports car). But the relationship is relatable, and gives the movie a casual, familiar tone.
 Much of the hilarity also comes from how calmly The Dude handles all the events. He rarely loses his cool or questions anything. There seems to be little difference in how he handles being the courier for a ransom hand off or having his car windows smashed compared to buying cream from the grocery store. He lets viewers experience the cool and calm persona they have always wanted to be.
 The visual style of the movie is certainly memorable. Recalling it brings a specific set of colors to mind, those being a sort of orange to tan spectrum. This can be seen from The Dude's gown he always wears, to the wood, the seats, and the wall paneling of the bowling alley, to the tinted glasses always worn by Walter. This is also perpetuated by the lighting of many of the scenes, as it usually comes from warm sources like candles or sunlight when the actual surroundings are not orange in color.
 The film is a representation of a feeling or lifestyle, not merely a story. The characters live outside the movies and reside in the heads of viewers as they are some of the most memorable from a single movie in film history. It is no wonder the film has such a cult following.",The Big Lebowski
1166,darrelowen,What a monumental waste of time.,1,9 November 2021,"I would love to have the 2 hours of my life back that I spent watching this stupid movie. Seeing the really high reviews, I decided to watch it. After about a half hour, I didn't like it, but sometimes movies take a while to get going, and the payoff might be at the end. An hour into it, it's not any better, but I figure I'm halfway through, so I might as well finish it, just in case it somehow redeems itself. That never happened, and it continued to be crap the entire time. I would say that if you watch this and don't like it after 30 minutes, just stop and go do something else, because it's not going to get any better.I've seen all these reviews from other people talking about what a great film this is, and I just don't get it. I'm reasonably intelligent, and I'm generally pretty easily entertained, but this movie was just dumb. Dumb, dumb, and dumb. Besides that, it's also stupid. I'd definitely like those two hours of my life back.",The Big Lebowski
1167,rrowens,This aggression shall not stand!,9,28 February 2006,"... but The Big Lebowski will, for a long time. With characters seemingly transported from a '70s hippie-exploitation B-movie, acting out a plot redolent of Raymond Chandler, only with enough slapstick to keep the Three Stooges busy for years, this movie's a bona fide hoot, whether or not you remember who Creedence was. Superb casting, line readings that shimmer, a quotable script, and a dream sequence that you'll remember every time you lace on those bowling shoes. And a soundtrack that includes Mickey Newbury's sublime ""Just Dropped In (to See What Condition My Condition was In)"" from 1968, sung by Kenny Rogers! I believe in nothing ... except The Big Lebowski.",The Big Lebowski
1168,beller-61993,"You call me the Dude, or his Dudeness, or El Duderino",7,10 December 2018,"The story of the Dude (Jeff Bridges) is a strange one indeed. Content to spend his days drinking white Russians and bowling with his buddies Walter (John Goodman) and Donny (Steve Buscemi), the Dude is the alpha bum and ultimate passivist. A case of mistaken identity is what forces the Dude to react (first to get reparations for his soiled rug and secondly to assist in the recovery of Bunny Lebowski) and a torrid tale of plot twists ensues. The Coen brothers are master story tellers that love to tell dark tales that focus on the internal truths of human nature. They do not give us heroes, but instead present us with realistic characters that possess questionable morals as seen in some of their other films like No Country for Old Men, Fargo and more recently The Ballad of Buster Scruggs. The Big Lebowski is no exception as every character introduced possesses some form of character flaw. Ultimately what the Coen brothers are trying to show us (Theme) is that nobody is perfect and that even a bum like the Dude can own the moral high ground over those of higher stature.The Dudes first interaction with one of these characters of higher stature occurs when he is mistaken for the other Jeffery Lebowski (David Huddleston) as one of the thugs urinates on his rug. The Dude visits Jeffery ""Big Lebowski"" Lebowski at his mansion to ask him to rectify the situation by paying for the soiled rug. Even though Mr. Lebowski is clearly at fault and morally obligated to make restitutions, he proceeds to deny any responsibility for the wrongful actions taken against the Dude. This theme continues when the Dude meets Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara), who is the one responsible for the earlier assault. At first Jackie comes off as a reasonable man, offering to pay the Dude a finder's fee for recovering the money he is owed. We quickly find that this was just a set-up, as the Dude slowly drifts off to sleep from the drugs Jackie has mixed into his drink. On a lesser note, though Maude Lebowski's (Julianne Moore) character comes across as cold she appears to me morally sound, however she tricks the Dude into impregnating her as she does not want a father that is going to ""stay in the picture"". All of these characters are elevated members of society yet lack the same morality as the lowly Dude.Throughout the film, the Dudes character is challenged mostly by his friend Walter, who continues to try and manipulate the Dude's decisions. While making the drop off of the ransom money, Walter manages to botch the entire operation by throwing a ""dummy"" bag, and jumping out of the moving car (while driving) which subsequently wrecks into a tree while the dude is inside. However, the Dude maintains his laissez-faire attitude (except with Walter) and remains static all through the film. The reoccurring theme or motif of bowling and white Russians further solidifies the Dudes character as a devil may care ""hippie"" that is very much lost in time. His mind is never truly in the moment at hand, subconsciously thinking about bowling as evident in the two beautifully constructed dream sequences. The soundtrack for the film is the who's who of 60s era music, including the Dudes favorite Creedence Clearwater Revival. Deemed by many as a cult masterpiece, The Big Lebowski shows that even the humblest vagrant can be righteous if their moral compass is true.",The Big Lebowski

1170,cianmulligan-06144,Well like that's your opinion man,10,19 March 2020,"It's rare that I feel obliged to write a review after seeing a movie but for this I felt I had to. This film does have a decent plot although not one you'd consider to be sensational. The main reason behind this film's popularity is it's script and characters. The performances in this film are flawless. Each actor is sensational and it honestly baffles me how there was no Oscar nods for any performances, or Oscar nods for anything at all. The script is funny although it's not one that would have you on the floor crying with laughter. The comedy is enhanced with excellent delivery and such memorability. There was a few scenes that had me desperate for air from laughing. Particularly the ending scene and the scene in which the dude nails a block of wood to the floor and put a chair against it for protection. Only to find it's an out swinging door. I would live to quote this movie with friends with lines such as obviously you're not a golfer, the dude abides, I'm the walrus or no I don't think he was close to cracking, but because of my age (I'm 16) it's rare people would understand what I'm saying and would just end up looking at me like I'm insane.
Overall just a joy to watch. Each second is a pleasure and after each time I see it I find something new in the script that I'd missed before that makes it funnier. A true great that will forever be seen as one of the greatest cult movies of all time.P. S, I also love the conversations between the trio of The dude, Donnie and Walter, The way Walter shuts down Donnie each time he speaks and the way he constantly talks about the Vietnam war and being Jewish are hilarious.",The Big Lebowski
1171,charlieboyd-53448,"A polarising, genreless film",6,20 January 2019,"My Dad absolutely loves this film; it speaks to him on a spiritual level or something. I personally don't understand the humour, and, when I do, find it too subtle to be funny. However The Big Lebowski doesn't fit into any other category of movie, so -- what is it?For me it was a disappointment, it having been so hyped up by my Dad. For others it was an absolute triumph, if you're into that kind of film. It takes a very specific person to enjoy a movie like that, but, if you do, it will certainly be one of your favourites. I guess it's much like Marmite, a kind of love-it hate-it situation. Personally I saw the funny side of it, and the reasons for it being such a cult classic, but it just didn't fit my style.Watch Fargo instead. If you've seen it, watch it again, and then think ""could the Coen brothers outdo themselves?"" If the answer is no, don't spoil your own opinion of them by seeing this film. If you think they could do something more out-there or interesting, sure give The Big Lebowski a go.",The Big Lebowski
1172,ashley_smith80,"Hey, nice marmot!",9,30 March 2006,"If you take the time to look through some of the more negative reviews of The Big Lebowski, you'll see that a lot of people simply don't 'get' this film. Frankly, I feel sorry for them, as they are missing out on one of the funniest, smartest films ever made. The characters are outlandish and OTT and are total losers. The Dude and Walter are definitely anti-heroes, which many people (mostly Americans I'm afraid) seem to have a major problem with. However European audiences have a great love for the lazy underdog, and the Dude is typical of such bumbling idiots as Inspector Cluseau (The Pink Panther films) and Charlie Chaplin, which may explain the film's success in the UK. It has become a cult hit amongst students, and is quoted by myself and my friends frequently! The film boasts very smart writing, and is knowingly bizarre and irreverent. The dialogue is fast-paced and witty, but slightly off-kilter, to match the overall pitch of the movie. I recommend The Big Lebowski to anyone who is a fan of the Coen Brothers' work, and other films which emphasise wit over action, such as Withnail and I and Lost in Translation.",The Big Lebowski
