0,Horst_In_Translation,Scandinavia keeps delivering,6,8 October 2021,"""Retfærdighedens ryttere"" or ""Riders of Justice"" is a Danish mix between crime, drama and comedy from 2020 and this was released not too long ago here, which means it took quite some time to make it to movie theaters, even if my country Germany is really not too far away from Denmark. This was written and directed by Anders Thomas Jensen, an Oscar winner in the short film category over 20 years ago and the screenplay is based on an idea by Nikolaj Arcel, another really successful Danish filmmaker. The film runs for almost two hours, so not a particularly short film. There have been quite a few films of this kind from Scandinavia, especially Denmark, but here and there also from the other countries located in Northern Europe. With ""of this kind"", I am talking about crime movies with a great deal of comedy to them, even if this one here does not feature half as much comedy as you could think if you have seen the trailer. Be it the fat guy firing his automatic gun like crazy, be it another character talking about being a therapist, be it one guy laughing because something is easy for him - some of the best comedic moments are included there already. The other moment that really stays in the mind for me is when they make plans on how to attack the bad guys and one says they should simply kill one of them and get everybody else at the funeral. Somehow that was the most hilarious moment of the film for me. I don't even know why. But I will get a bit more into detail about that later on. What surprised me quite a bit was how they went with a completely different German title. The Danish and English titles mean the same and refer to the name of the biker gang, even if it also fits out unlikely heroes in here. The German title was something like ""Riders of Probability"" and took into consideration the element of how likely an event could happen. This idea of how the chances were so small for something like this to happen reminded me a bit of the Coen Brothers films where this is almost always an issue. To some extent. Sometimes more. Sometimes less.In contrast to that, there is a great deal of violence in here too and that felt more like Tarantino somehow, but yeah people really getting shot from a very close distance can be brutal, but if you have seen other Danish films, then you won't be surprised about this inclusion. The scene I mentioned earlier already in which the chubby fella shoots like crazy reminded me of DiCaprio and his flame thrower or what it was in Tarantino's most recent film. How he goes all-in really. Of course, I must mention the cast. Many really established Danish actors that have made waves internationally as well. Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Lars Brygmann and Nicolas Bro have been in the industry for decades and they received some solid awards recognition for this film too (okay, Bro not so much). Especially with Danish awards bodies, this was a huge success. A bit surprised though that Brygmann won big from the gang. Equally surprised about Heick Gadeberg. I mean she was okay, but not that great. The lead is of course Mads Mikkelsen, the man you see on the poster, even if, with the beginning especially, you could make a point for Nikolaj Lie Kaas also being lead. As for Mikkelsen, he mostly lost to himself in Druk when nominated for this film. He looks really different here. Almost no hair on top of his head, but a massive beard. Mikkelsen's best moment from the dark comedy perspective is probably when he kills the first fella after being told to leave immediately with a gun pointed to his head. That was pretty dark. Also his brief apology afterwards how he says he overreacted and should not have done that was a bit on the hilarious side. Then there is also emotional gravity to him as he lost his wife in a potential terrorist attack. Or did he really? We find out near the end and that flashback scene to Africa was fairly hilarious when the man elaborates on how he did not like food and drinks in Denmark. Another darkly comedic moment because it showed us that they had been wrong all along. Well, except Emmenthaler at the beginning. Cool name as well. The bad guys come up with that cheese reference.With Mikkelsen's character, this was also a crucial point and you could wonder if he lives or dies in the end. The writers also play with us there when he talks about feeling cold. But in the end, it's his meltdown scene with the glass in the bathroom that is the worst that happens to him and we see him with the gang. It was probably not just for him, but also for the character's daughter that they did not want to turn her into an orphan. Speaking of Emmenthaler who I just mentioned as well, I must make another reference to his crazy shooting because this was a comedic moment, but there was some seriousness to it as well because he unleashes there so wildly and effortlessly and a little later when he is really about to shoot one of the bad guys, he cannot do it. He cannot take a life. So Mikkelsen's character takes care of it. What a killing machine he plays in here. Totally rogue. Another pretty dark side includes the young man from Eastern Europe that they free from the bad guys and we find out about his past as a sex slave and how others in his profession did not make it out alive. There are many dark moments here. Unemployment at the very beginning is still among the more harmless aspects. We find out one character lost his daughter in a car accident several years ago, so I wondered if he maybe steps in as some kind of father figure if Mikkelsen's character gets killed in the end, but yeah, as I said already, he did not. Or another character with tons of sessions with a psychiatrist, even if this is really seen more from the funny side. I must still say when these folks act as therapists to help the teenage daughter, this was maybe one of very few occasions where the film did not work too well for me from a comedic perspective and also it was one reason why I cannot give it another two stars (or one as I rate out of 5). Also the subtitling there was really no good unfortunately. I saw this line in the trailer when he says one way or the other he is a psychologist or they are psychologists and this really got lost in translation in the movie with the subtitles while the dubbed version delivered this joke as nicely as it was in the Danish original. So kinda the other way around this time with subtitles being poor and the dubbing being superior.Then there's also conflicts between our unlikely heroes here in terms of the mentality inside the group. Sometimes they result in physical confrontations even (the car scene, again much funnier in the trailer than in the movie), on other occasions they just result in screaming at one another (the wires) or provoking each other (like when one character is really good with guns and another is jealous). Finally, a few more words on the element of likelihood in here, even if I elaborated on that already briefly at the beginning of my review. I think it was done okay all in all. Maybe the fact how the bad guys find the boyfriend via an influencer video that one of the antagonists' daughter watches was a bit too much, but generally I liked the ""it's all just a coincidence"" explanation. It did not work fully, but good enough. And it is true. Look at the bike theft. Look at Mikkelsen's character calling that day and how it results in the girl's mother telling her that she does not have to go to school that day and they take the train for a mother-daughter day to lift the girl's spirit again. Or how one character sits exactly inside that train. And offers the woman the seat because the seat next to him does not stay empty and is taken right before by another passenger. And so on. So many more examples. I liked that a lot. Also I found it funny how big sheds can mean a lot to people apparently.Mikkelsen's character living in the end is truly another lucky event. Great pullover he wears too in that final scene. But the main antagonist's comment on what they have done to them was excellent as well because he really has no clue and they may have done horrible acts in the past, but the connection with Mikkelsen's character and Nikolaj Lie Kaas' was entirely random and coincidence. Resulting from wrong conclusions. Of course, they had to depict this biker gang as despicable as it gets to justify Mikkelsen's character's killings here because otherwise those could also be considered a huge exaggeration. Innocent victims etc. But we are supposed to think these guys deserved what was coming their way. I think that is it now. Pretty good movie and here and there even a great moment. Also Mikkelsen, who is really a global superstar at this point pretty much, going back to Denmark to make movies there is something I like and which tells us about the high level of current Danish/Scandinavian cinema. We Germans can only be jealous of what such a much smaller country is doing. Christoph Waltz is not making any German films these days for example. Or Austrian I should say, even if Austrian movies are superior in many areas as well compared to German films. But that's another story. Okay I know Daniel Brühl is also shooting German films, actually directing himself nowadays. Now, we are drifting too far away. The outcome here gets a thumbs-up from me for sure and there was never any doubt there. Go see this one unless you strongly dislike two out of the three genres crime, comedy and drama or cannot deal with graphic violence. Okay, it's not super graphic either except two or three moments perhaps. But we don't see the mother's corpse early on when Mikkelsen's character sees it for example. This was also somewhat dark in a comedic way how a character offered his seat and then this terrible accident happened. This is it now. Thanks for reading and go check this movie out. It felt shorter than two hours. Always a good sign. No lengths in here really and pretty much no dragging. (tt11655202)",Riders of Justice
1,nogodnomasters,Stay away from the wires,8,1 June 2021,"An explosion near a train kills some passengers. Among the dead is a man who was going to testify against the bike gang, ""Riders of Justice."" A man who creates algorithms (ones that can tell us rich people drive Mercedes and poor people drive Kias) survived the blast and believes it could not be coincidental. He believes a man who exited the train had something to do with the blast. He involves a few other people, including military man Mads Mikkelsen who lost his wife in the explosion. They enact a plan of revenge.The film also looks at how things interact, how small unrelated events trigger larger ones. In this instance, an Estonian girl wanting a blue bicycle as opposed to a red one starts it all off. The group of characters are enjoyable and there are a number of light moments. I liked the ending.I watched the film with subtitles.Guide: F-word. Brief nudity. No sex.",Riders of Justice
2,kosmasp,Off Beat and quite the (butterfly) effect,9,26 September 2021,"You know what they say ... how certain things lead to other things happening. And it all seems to start with a girl wanting a bicylce ... you would not imagine where this leads too. So many variables and so many different things playing into this.And a movie that is not afraid to be violent and crazy. It switches from funny to sad to over the top action. And it works - if you let yourself dive into it. The actors are doing a great job with it. If you've seen a few movies, you may be able to recognize a couple of them anyway, not just Mads Mikkelsen.This will not be everyones cup of tea, but those who love movies that are off beat and are quite hard to describe, let alone guess where they go next ... who live from crazy yet relatable characters ... well they will rejoice and be as entertained as they can be. Do not expect this to be like a smooth US movie - that would be by the numbers and this is doing anything but that. It may even offend you in one way or another ...",Riders of Justice
3,searchanddestroy-1,Comedy? Hmmmm,6,13 September 2021,"This is a cliché ridden crime drama, more than a comedy, though there are some funny lines in it. Madds Mikkelsen is above everyone and everything, awesome as usual. The topic is of course a bit run of the mill, ordinary, but the development deserves to be watched. Rather gloomy and poignant with a good character study and symphony. The scheme of the wrong ""bad guys"" who prepared and commited the bomb killing aboard the train, this idea is so terrific. Only the ending is totally lousy and almost spoils the whole.",Riders of Justice
4,CinemaSerf,Quirkily written dark comedy.,7,15 September 2021,"Mads Mikkelsen seems to be trying to do his level best to reinvigorate Danish cinema for an international audience - and here, again, he performs well. This time, he leads a slightly disparate band of geeks and misfits who are trying to get to the bottom of a train crash that killed his wife. Was it an accident or something far more sinister? It turns out that Mads (""Markus"") has some serious military training so their investigation is not without some rather arbitrarily applied justice as they seek the truth. The rest of his gang provide great support, as does his rather bemused teenage daughter who is obviously struggling with her own feelings of remorse as her father appears to go off the rails, somewhat. It is a violent film, but the violence is cleverly wrapped in a blanket of humour and an almost slap-stick style of action that brings plenty of smiles as they go along. I didn't love the ending, but I did enjoy the film.",Riders of Justice
5,zardoz-13,One Hell of a Great Revenge Actioneer!!!,10,9 August 2021,"A statistician, Otto (Nikolaj Lie Kaas of ""Child 44"") and his friends are convinced that the death of a soldier's wife is linked to other events that make her demise a case of murder rather than an accident. Otto approaches the authorities with his theory, but the police refuse to do anything. Before the accident occurred, Otto had given up his seat so the wife, Emma (Anne Birgitte Lind), and her daughter could sit rather than stand. Eventually, backed up by his nerdy friends, the statistician takes his case to the father
Markus (Mads Mikkelsen of ""Casino Royale"") who has just arrived from the battlefield to attend to his grieving daughter, Mathilde (Andrea Heick Gadeberg of ""Daniel"") and he refuses to let psychologists help them recover from this tragedy. The nerds provide a wealth of information, consisting of coincidences galore, that suggest an eyewitness aboard the train was about to testify in a major crime trial and the criminals hired someone to orchestrate the wreck. Clocking in just shy of two hours, this gripping revenge thriller mixes comedy with tragedy without going overboard on either and writer & director Anders Thomas Jensen turns it into an unforgettable actioneer with an ensemble cast. Movies that traffick in surprises galore, like ""Riders of Justice,"" are few and far between. Once Markus goes into action and starts gunning down anybody connected with his wife's death, he is a stone-cold killer who makes John Wick look like a child in knee breeches. Mikkelsen resembles one of the Fabulous Furry Freak brothers with his close-cropped hair and his bushy beard. The performances are good, and everybody--even a gay bystander--who was rescued by our heroes has a backstory. The gay moments in this otherwise terrific saga may offend straight-laced spectators, but those who stick with ""Riders of Justice"" will be thoroughly pleased with the outcome.",Riders of Justice
6,evanston_dad,Good Enough to Make You Wish It Was Better,7,29 October 2021,"""Riders of Justice"" is just good enough to make you wish it was better.I'm not sure the Danes are the go-to people for comedy. Which is strange, because I know Danish people and they have great senses of humor. But it somehow doesn't translate all that well to Danish films. This one is an uneasy mix between psychological thriller, crime drama, and slapstick comedy that provides some decent entertainment but doesn't do any of what it's trying to do particularly well. The humor is strained, though there are moments that are pretty funny. It's a film about the trauma induced by letting rage and violence be a person's dominant way of dealing with the world, as embodied by the character played by Mads Mikkelsen, great as always, a man who seeks revenge on the people who are responsible for the death of his wife, yet is surrounded by people who try to convince him that there are better ways to find healing. It's a good premise, and it offers a nice divergence from the usual revenge movie tropes. How disappointing then that the finale finds this ragtag and lovable bunch of characters gun down an entire gang of criminal thugs with no compunction and worse, no apparent consequences. A movie that spends an hour and a half convincing us that killing others leaves humans permanently scarred ends with a scene of casual violence that makes guns look cool. Boo. Please Danes, don't become just like Americans.Speaking of Americans, they are bound to remake this movie someday, with someone like Hugh Jackman in the main role.Grade: B+",Riders of Justice
7,ferguson-6,Mad Mads,7,13 May 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Carl Jung coined the term synchronicity to describe occurrences that appear related, yet lack a clear connection. Writer-director Anders Thomas Jensen (Nicolaj Arcel is credited with the idea) starts us off with a slew of coincidences: Mathilde's bike is stolen, her dad calls to say his military assignment has been extended, her mom decides they should take the train to town, a man surrenders his seat to Mathilde's mom, a passenger throws away his sandwich while getting off the train, a bomb derails the train after that stop, a key witness in a criminal trial is killed, and the man who gave up his seat is a probability expert who begins assembling the pieces before going to Mathilde's dad to present his case. Were these coincidences related or is it possible meaning is being found where none exists?Mads Mikkelsen stars as Markus, who returns home from military service to care for his teenage daughter Mathilde (Andrea Heick Gadeberg) after the train wreck killed his wife/her mother (Anna Birgitte Lind). The problem is that Markus is a no-nonsense man who deals with his grief by not dealing at all ... except for guzzling beer and slapping Mathilde's boyfriend. Markus is a different look than what we usually get with Mads. His tussled hair has been sheared and he sports a full beard. He's a combustible man about to burst with pent-up aggression, which makes him especially accepting to the theory he's about to hear.Otto (Nikolaj Lie Kass) is the statistical analyst who gave up his seat on the train. His partner Lennart (Lars Brygmann) is a brilliant man, likely on the spectrum, while Emmenthaler (Nicolas Bro) is an obese loner and computer whiz. This trio reminds of The Lone Gunman from ""The X-Files"", and add a dash of dark comedic flair to an otherwise weighty and somber affair. Soon joined by Bodashka (Gustav Lind), a victim a human trafficking, this is a team of flawed and damaged individuals, each dealing with their own personal baggage - while focused on Markus' obsession with vengeance.The titular Riders of Justice are a criminal gang whose leader was set to go on trial. The key witness died in the train wreck, kicking off the domino effect for Otto's theory and Markus' path of wrath. Can the series of coincidences be mathematically explained, and if so, can this group of overly intelligent, geeky misfits lead the vengeance-seeking husband down the path of vigilante justice?Filmmaker Jensen nicely balances the moments of extreme violence with the Brainiac segments so that we can easily follow what Markus is doing, and why. The group therapy has us questioning if life can be mathematically predicted, or if coincidences are simply that. Other supporting work comes from Roland Moller and Albert Rudbeck Lindhart, but as you might expect, it's Mikkelsen who captivates on screen. He's not skilled as a cuddly parent, but his military training suits this mission. Were this to receive a U. S. remake (hopefully not), we could expect Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington as obvious choices for the lead.NY & LA theaters May 14th, 2021 and everywhere May 21st, 2021.",Riders of Justice

12,Thanos_Alfie,Simply amazing...,8,20 October 2021,"""Riders of Justice"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch a group of people doing some very dangerous and important actions without thinking a lot about them since they believe that they are doing it for the greater good.I liked this movie very much because it had a very interesting plot that consisted of some plot twists that I did not expect and the combination of drama with some comic relief moments was simply amazing. The direction which was made by Anders Thomas Jensen was also very good and he succeeded on making us feel what his main characters being through and follow them on their journey. The interpretation of Mads Mikkelsen who played as Markus was simply outstanding and he proved his talent. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Nikolaj Lie Kaas' who played as Otto, Nicolas Bro's who played as Emmenthaler and Lars Brygmann's who played as Lennart. Lastly, I have to say that ""Riders of Justice"" is an amazing movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.",Riders of Justice
13,eddie_baggins,Watch before the remake,6,16 September 2021,"You heard it here first, Riders of Justice will at some stage become a Hollywood remake, as this Danish mixture of thriller/comedy and a sprinkling of hard drama harbors within it a great story of revenge and intrigue that whilst as it stands doesn't set the world on fire, makes for a ripe foundation for what could be a genuinely great film.Frequent collaborators, director Anders Thomas Jensen and leading man Mads Mikkelsen (once more proving to us why his one of the best working in the business right now) start things off with a bang here as we are introduced to a scenario where Mikkelsen's army man Markus is rushed back home to care for his teenage daughter when his wife is the victim of what appears to be an unfortunate train accident but when Markus is told by a duo of researchers that claim they know more about the accident and what it may've been, Markus is set on course for action against a criminal group that appear to have played a part in the occurrence.Filled with various twists and turns, Justice takes us on a journey we are not always prepared for as Markus squads up with Nikolaj Lie Kaas's deep thinking Otto, Lars Brygmann's complicated Lennart and Nicolas Bro's computer wizz Emmenthaler and while at times it appears as though Jensen's film is headed down a particular pathway or set-up Jensen's oddball script and bizarre moments keep things fresh for better and for worse as the film finds it tough balancing its various tonal shifts with audience sentiment as we remain often unaware of how we are supposed to be feeling at any given time.Dealing with some heavy material that lay at the core of its narrative, Justice could be draining stuff without the moments of lightness it has frequently throughout, often courtesy of Emmenthaler's unpredictable behavior or Jensen's witty script but at times you wish it had decided more concretely what film it exactly wanted to be as you can't help but feel this familiar feeling yet originally constructed set-up had more to give us than what exists as a final product.Despite these failings there's very little doubt that Justice is a well-made and performed film and a rare example of a foreign film that deserves a chance to be remade with hope that all of its elements can combine into one to create something truly special.Final Say -A unique hybrid of a film, Riders of Justice features yet another top quality Mads Mikkelsen performance and a story that surprises at multiple occasions but its uneven tone and difficulty in making us understand what we should be feeling because of it halts its chances of becoming a must-watch.3 thrown out lunches out of 5.",Riders of Justice

Nope. The motorbike gang in this movie is never seen on motorbikes. They're always in cars, whether going to a restaurant, doing a drive-by, or whatever. That complaint out of the way, I thought the movie wasn't that bad, actually. Were the buffoonish comedic elements really necessary? Not to me. It distracted from the seriousness of the picture.

The actors themselves are equally interesting and prove that being able to convincingly convey something is transbordering. The film has a good mixture of humor, action and pathos; and the plot is not only deeply entwined and full of twists & turns, but is constructed with some thought and asks the same from you.Though it has some of that minimalistic style that's beginning to cross the Atlantic, Riders of Justice carries many elements that warrants a larger audience.",Riders of Justice
23,Movi3DO,Tragic and profound,10,23 August 2021,"What if coincidences are just coincidences?A dark comedy revenge drama involving a group consisting of three nerds and a hardened soldier.This movie started out pretty weird. Although the atmosphere seemed serious, there were many comedic and also sad moments that brought the characters together.Although, the mixture of these two genre elements seemed random, later it made sense once I understood the theme, which was the aspect that I loved the most about the movie. The core of the story was about how certain chain of events or coincidences led to the present outcome, that could be either good or bad. This led to another theme of dealing with grief and denial by trying to find meaning of things, which either leads to nothing or even causes more pain. This also begs the option of if God could make sense of these coincidences.The complexities of these themes made me think a lot of about the movie. They created another great way of depicting revenge and dealing with grief. I appreciated the seemingly unrealistic yet very real portrayal of life. It's also a tragedy near the end that was heartbreaking.This theme affected the characters a lot. Although the characters were goofy, they were all weird and broken people in different ways. Among the cast, Mads Mikklelsen was great as the sad soldier who desperately wanted to find closure and delayed the grieving process. This man was amazing and again carried the movie that he was in.Overall, despite a slightly slow start, it was a profound and tragic story. 9.5/10.",Riders of Justice

26,PedroPires90,Good one,8,21 June 2021,"It delivers. It doesn't limit itself to be just an action/drama/revenge film, it gives important lessons about choices, about relationships, about grief and about forgiveness.Once again, Mads Mikkelsen has a fantastic performance (that moment on the bathroom, god damn!) but all the supporting cast do a very good job.",Riders of Justice
27,President_George_Washington,FROM THE DESK OF GEORGE WASHINGTON,5,24 May 2021,"Good Morrow.When we first meet the three idiot savants, I was amused. Their near Aspergers'esq neurosis was an amusing contrast to the serious Special Ops Type-A guy, Markus. It was entertaining to watch them bicker and cower like the man-children they were. Individually, they were ineffective, but working together as a nerd-team, they were able to overcome their challenges and become a unified force and crucial members of Markus' revenge team.Then it started to all bog down. One nerd had over 4 million hours of therapy so he volunteered his presumed skills to help Markus' daughter overcome nonstop issues. In a scene that drug on forever, we see them sorting through problems...none of which matter to the central plot.Which is: Exacting revenge on those responsible for blowing a commuter train and killing Markus' wife....it didn't take long for the nerds to over-stay their welcome. What was funny in the first half of the movie became monotonous...and the therapy-lovin' nerd running from Markus in the field and pulling his pants down? It was out of place and - honestly - gross.It wasn't funny or quirky. Their purpose was comedic relief, not an honest examination of mental issues...but frequently this film tries to have it both ways. Brutal revenge and quirky European comedy....and if the three dorks weren't enough to fill out supporting roles. They added a male prostitute who, of course, came with his own set of problems we get to hear about and add the blue-haired boyfriend of the daughter. All six of them with loads of dialog - when the only reason anyone signed up for the movie was to watch Mads go mad.We get some of that and when he's taking out bad guys, the film is great...but then it regresses right back into the numerous issues of our supporting cast. I can handle the dad and some of the daughter's annoying issues. That's fine...but the issues of all of them? It was way too much. The prostitute and the boyfriend should have been cut from the movie. Their time-sucking roles added nothing but running time...running time that should have included more of the revenge and less of the yakking.Mads, of course, is always excellent. He's the only reason to watch this. For reasons I can't fathom, they barely gave him any lines...I get he's a man of action and little words. He speaks with his fists!All good, but this isn't a Rambo flick...when Rambo isn't killing, he's doing interesting stuff necessary for more killing. Here, when Markus isn't shooting the bad guys, he's watching chatting nerds - and often, he's not even on the screen.I'm not sure how I feel about the ending. The nerds find inner-strength and work together as a team to save the day. A fairly simplistic (Hollywood style) resolution to a movie that asked the viewers to take a serious look a grief and a load of mental issues.Overall, it's not a bad movie and probably worth a watch, but it could have been so much better.Cheers.",Riders of Justice
28,fciocca,Confusing Danish cinema at its finest,4,21 July 2021,"Mads Mikkelsen after the global exposure gained with several Hollywood blockbusters, came back to his motherland, and took part in some Danish projects. ""Riders of Justice"" is one of his latest flicks and most probably nobody would even consider watching this thing if it was not for him.This is some sort of revenge movie, with plenty of Deja-vu: a man loses his wife in what seems to be a train accident, but then a group of nerds came into his life, telling him that what happened was not just a coincidence, but a premeditated assassination. This was already explained in the release trailer, so I am not spoiling anything. There is no major plot twist, no interesting action sequences, however some characters such as Lennart and Otto are compelling, because through them the director explored a little bit the topic of personal trauma. There are in fact many interesting subjects discussed, such as taking care of the individual's mental health, and don't be afraid to seek professional help when in need. The problem is that none of this can be taken seriously because the director ridicules some of these topics pretty heavily. In one scene he is talking seriously about abuses, and in the next one he is basically mocking the same exact situation, but with trivial and, in some cases, offensive jokes. I have no problem with black humor, but it needs to be done smartly. It is not easy to joke on psychological issues and be funny.This is a movie that suffers from an identity crisis: it is an action flick, full of shootouts and violence, but at the same time it wants to be deep and meaningful, while being funny. There are just too many elements all together mixed up pretty badly and incoherently. Writer should have simplified the screenplay. They wanted to represent too many things in one single movie. The result is a messy production.",Riders of Justice

Mads was great as usual but Kass, Brygman and Bro were fantastic as well. I rarely see a movie that excites me after I've seen it but seriously, you have got to see this flick. It has suspense, comedy, action, emotional and it's so intelligently written. Well done all!!I used to opt for non subtitled movies until Covid came along and since I've seen dozens and dozens. The reason being of course so few new movies and I've seen there weren't many movies worth watching that I haven't seen and I've seen everything worth watching. I had no idea how many great movies I'd missed out on, especially Chinese, Swedish and Norwegian and a few from Russia.I was a Netflix junkie for years, still a stockholder and they have the best series, but if your a true cinephile, Amazon is where you should be. Hats off to Amazon for all their incredible selection of movies, new, old and foreign. And they finally made new releases affordable for $6.99.This was one of the best movies in a long time, Truly a very well done. I very rarely rate a movie a 10 but this is certainly one that's deserving.Don't miss this one!!",Riders of Justice

This is a joyful experience from beginning to end (even when most of the plot is rather dark), thanks to how fresh the storytelling artistry of Anders Thomas Jensen feels as a writer/director. He writes wonderful characters and proves to be an excellent director of actors (the whole cast is brilliant, not only the great Mads Mikkelsen), but also the story is excellently timed and it's funny, fresh and engaging form the first minute. As a bonus, this is a Christmas movie! (at least as much a Christmas movie as ""Die Hard"" or ""Gremlins"") So don't miss it, because it's going to be a future classic.",Riders of Justice

34,nidhunmoviebuff,A sensational revenge thriller laced with dark humour!,9,2 August 2021,"Mads Mikkelsen delivers a second sensational Danish film this year after the Oscar-winning Another Round with the brilliant 'Riders of Justice' that strikes the right balance between the revenge thriller and dark humor genres.Mikkelsen is brilliant as an army officer who returns home after the suspicious death of his wife, only to uncover a huge conspiracy behind the accident that caused it. He assembles a hilarious rag-tag bunch of nerds to get revenge on the perpetrators.Each of the characters is brilliantly written as having their own demons to deal with and through them, director Anders Thomas Jensen delivers a poignant tale of loss and coming to terms with and coping with depression.Without ever being preachy, Riders of Justice shows its titular character in Mikkelsen go through the five stages of grief-being violent in denial and anger, alienating his friends through the bargaining and depression stages and finally finding catharsis and relief in acceptance.One of the best films of the year. Brilliant. Highly recommended!",Riders of Justice

Not sure why it doesn't have a higher rating on IMDB.This film is comedic, it seriously tackles trauma, PSD, and a father daughter relationship all wrapped up in an action film.The performances done by each character is phenomenal. Each character is well defined.The cinematography is excellent even though you'll tend not to notice because you'll be so into the film. This is a movie I'll have to watch again partly because it's sub titled and partly to catch all the great cues and scenes.Lastly there's some pretty cool action scenes that are performed well.

The characters were brilliant as was the acting, production & script.It starts as a thriller, goes to drama, comedy, action etc. But really holds your attention. I watched it with English subtitles and found it very funny at times too.A group of weak, flawed Men, bond together by standing up to bullies and along the way, they discover where they are all lacking. The tough action man dad learns to accept his emotions and show his softness, the ex- alcoholic that killed his family in car crash, helps other men in their suffering. Lots of examples, but not in your face. It unfolds in the dialogue, plot and acting. Perfectly done, I say that as a man. No crap like men are stupid and women are strong and smarter just because of their gender etc. It's realistic and leaves you thinking afterwards.

38,js-66130,THE B-TEAM,9,21 May 2021,"A rolling and coasting thrill ride with abrupt gear changes to keep everyone guessing is the bestest Hollywood smirk action blockbuster to come out of Denmark.Mads Mikkelson stars, of course, as a stone faced army machine brought home from one tour of duty to another. The shocking death of his wife paratroops our hero back into civilian life where a reluctant teenage daughter awaits parenting.The circumstance of tragedy leads to the inevitable daft father surly daughter clash, and the movie looks well on the way to an emotional series of life lessons. Don't hunt for the tissues just yet, for there is more afoot than meets the misty eye.Guilt haunted by the explosive train crash which he luckily survived, a conspiracy nut and statistician whiz seeks some sort of redemption, which he finds in a far fetched theory, that once numbers are crunched becomes too plausible not to act on. Joined by a couple of other keyboard tapping stooges, they manage to convince our hero of their theory. With a satisfying explanation and a villain to focus on, Markus (Mikkelson) goes into combat revenge mode. It is awesome, and much easier than parenting. Grief is hard, revenge is easy.Tagging along in a bizarre B-Team special forces unit of misfits - computer geeks with guns - brings much needed levity to an otherwise efficient by the numbers body count flick. The oddball characters' hilarious internal squabbling and deadpan commentary provide the perfect balance for this dark, violent tale.""Riders of Justice"" plays on the theory of chance, that certain choices no matter how insignificant, lead to a series of events. And true to theory, everything is linked from start to finish in a clever loop that wraps this movie present with a wonderful Christmas bow. A real Danish treat. Cheers.hipCRANK.",Riders of Justice

It explores the meaning of death and the meaning of life as it presents a motley crew of characters brought together by a set of curious circumstances. Touches on a variety of subjects from obesity to disability to the existence of God. Contains explicit references to homosexuality and uses the Lords name in vain. Visually dark and subtitled. Madds Mikkelsen perfectly leads a perfect cast, enabling the director to maintain continuity of engagement throughout.

There are each unique in their own way and all have noticeable imperfection to them (whether it's physical or psychological) but it makes it very easy to identify with them, even when they make gut-wrenching mistakes.The story is well-written, even though it gets a bit hairy towards the end, which is the main reason I don't think it's perfect, it is still enjoyable start to finish. A word of warning, I'm not sure what they show kids in Denmark these days, but this movie is def not for kids, several nudities and violent scenes.Overall recommended if you can sit through high-intensity films.

Otto tells her it's meaningless to try to make sense of it, and Mathilde replies..""it's just easier when there is someone to be mad at"".

I've seen this movie on demand for a year and I couldn't make myself watch it due to being a foreign film, not that I don't watch them and enjoy them but trying to read the dialogue sometimes you miss expressions or looks that are important. So yday I watched the trailer and saw Mads M was the lead (one of my favorite foreign actors) and decided to give it a whirl.Boy was I glad I did, a beautifully written, superbly acted, and just overall a GREAT movie. Good character development, each one different personality but their problems (serious ones) are trying to find themselves but are all brought together to help each other in their tragic situations by another tragic situation. It has action, drama, sadness, and they even bring humor into this dark but sometimes uplifting film. One of my favorite foreign films now as it shot to near the top of the list (City of God, Let the right One In).

Plenty of friction and conflicts that everyone commits and tries to solve in their own way. It is a delight to follow the actors and the film, to laugh, to grieve and to be surprised once in a while where the film is going.Great cinematography, editing and score.The film has some violence that reminds me of the great gangster films of Takeshi Kitano: short, to the point, effective. The film thus stays true to a very real line, yet always stays with the characters.This Danish film is a true discovery for all lovers of the black-humored, action-packed, hardboiled buddy movie with lots of humanity, friendship, heart, sadness and depth.Definitely a film to see and discover.Highly recommended.",Riders of Justice

It's hard to label this movie since it is obvioulsy a drama, but it also offers great bits of raw and laugh-out-loud comedy. In that sense, it remind me a little of ""Jojo Rabbit"". Such juxtaposition of moods and genres could have been a disaster, if not for the perfect balance achieved by Jensen.

He sets the screen on fire in a serious role. // I hate plot spoilers, but I think it's helpful to know . . . The Riders Of Justice are an underground gang. // The movie is filmed in Danish. Big tidbit: you can watch with English overdubbing. You also have closed captioning. Go to ""set up"". // I am kind of ashamed to say it, but we Americans hate and avoid ""foreign"" films. But, you Europeans got this one right. Good job, and it's extremely interesting. // I hate to give too much away, but a couple of mad scientists solve the crime through an elaborate system of statistics and probability. // The movie might be described as a psychological movie, and really gets into the heads of each individual character. First of all, you won't even recognize Mads. He really looks different; he's fuller in the face. His character, Markus, is an ex-soldier, and he's ruthless. He is really dealing with adjusting to life in polite society. But, he's kind of what the band of sleuths needs to solve the crime. // The photography is mediocre. The music is good. I liked it. The directing kind of stinks, but the acting, by all, is awesome!! I liked that the conversations seemed very natural and realistic. Almost all the characters are pathetic, in a Greek play sort of way. But, they are huge and larger than life. I could have lived without making Sirius gay. Movie makers pitifully feel compelled to stick a gay in everything, nowadays!! // There is a lot of killing in the movie, which is in total contrast to the mood of the movie. The mood is subdued; almost quiet. // I know Americans abhor overdubbing. If you can stand that, you will like this movie. I did. // My litmus test is, will I watch it again?

The action scenes aren't aplenty, but when they arrive they are well done and satisfactory. The humour is wacky, to say the least. I laughed out loud a few times, and I think it's a bit difficult to get humour across in films with a foreign language. There are plenty visual funny moments as well. Mads and the other 3 main actors bounce off each other brilliantly. Watch it, you will not be disappointed.",Riders of Justice
79,ian-dodkins,"Touching, interesting, well written",8,2 June 2021,"This is a film like warm wine on a chilly eve. The characters are beautifully written, and the story depicts how they fit together and somehow fill each other's gaping holes in their lives. Huggable middle aged men with complex pasts that get vengeance on a perceived wrong. The analytical trio are especially amusing and few people can write intelligent characters without it seeming trite, but this script writer does so. Although there is some action, the story focuses on the character development and personal resolutions, particularly the difficult reconciliation of father and daughter, as well as bringing up questions of how events are produced by a causal web, rather than simple causal links, and whether when seeking justice it is simply for our own benefit and the recipient of that justice, are they to blame or just part of a causal chain. Of course the philosophical aspects are very much a subplot rather than the main story, and so is interwoven without being overbearing or pretentious.Though a well produced film, the way it develops and the witty well thought out script are well beyond Hollywood tropes. If you like Mads Mikkelson or Danish films you'll enjoy this. Don't watch this if you're expecting high octane action, but do watch it of you want a thoughtful and reflective film with some beautifully scripted scenes.",Riders of Justice

OK the first 10 minutes were quite engaging, but then it was the old ""we don't care about the story, we want to kill people"". These film-makers need way more than 4,00 hours of therapy. The central character is horrendous. We are supposed to sympathise with him, really? He's a cold-blooded murderer. By the way, I was unpleasantly surprised that Denmark participates in this NATO BS too - invading other countries, killing civilians there, controlling their resources, organising colour revolutions, forming terrorist groups. And this murderer brainwashes his daughter into atheism between killing sprees.After all this, the idyllic finale celebrating Christmas, really? Why are they not in prison?Oh, and I see the Danish are as ignorant about anything that doesn't directly concern them as Americans. And they can't be bothered to do the smallest bit of research. I mean that Ukrainian boy with an idiotic non-existent name, of course. The only time I laughed watching this film was when he was telling a ""Ukrainian legend"" about a woman with another idiotic name, who is from Vitebsk, which is in Belarus. Do they not study geography in Denmark? Do they not teach children to verify information? That's just lazy and even offensive because it shows how much they don't care about the rest of the world.The most important question is HOW is it a comedy? Is the fact they thought it wasn't an accident and consequently killed at least a dozen people but in fact it was an accident so funny?

93,TruthTeller98765,Very good movie - not perfect,8,8 July 2021,"The first half of this movie is better than the second half. This movie attempts to balance a lot of different themes, from deathly serious to overly humorous, from thoughtful philosophy to grotesquely violent, in a way that few films are bold enough to try. This works better in the first half of the movie when the characters are first introduced than the second half when things wrap up. The movie comes to a very abrupt end... it's actually kind of strange. You feel like you are in the 'middle' of a movie and then there is a big, not overly big, scene and the movie just ends with little resolution of the interpersonal conflicts. You feel like the somewhat 'big' scene is the start of the apex of the movie, but then you realize it actually was the apex and everything ends. There are so many unresolved loose ends between the characters that it feels kind of bittersweet when the movie ends.Mads Mikkelsen, however, is just perfect as always.

95,lambertrecovery,Not much to recommend here,4,16 July 2021,I watched Riders of Justice because I love Mads Mikelsen but he isn't enough to recommend this movie as entertaining or worth watching. Paired with 3 other Danish actors you'll recognize it's the story of a soldier who returns home from Afghanistan to deal with a death in his family. He sets about meeting out justice/violence on those he holds responsible with his 3 companions and the action scenes are well done. Also well done is the relationship Mads has with his daughter who doesn't put up with any of his crap. But those 2 pluses can't compensate for a film that is mostly downbeat and erratic.,Riders of Justice

98,mr.slut,"Terribly unfunny, unemotional and superficial",4,4 October 2021,"I like dark humor, I like biting satire. But I can't laugh at jokes about child-rape, forced prostitution or white slavery.The premise of the movie was indeed intriguing - the ambivalence of how to cope with loss and how to find solice in other persons - even if they are complete strangers driven together by fate.Yet the emotional side of the story is painfully superficial and never goes to places of deeper impact. All the violence committed seems not really to affect anybody on a deeper level in the film.Without going deeper into the plot (in order not to spoil any surprises), there is no remorse of the violent action taken - there is no questioning the outcome - all happens rather randomly without psychological or legal consequences.I read comparisons to the humor of the Coen Brothers - oh my! They (half of the time) deliver quite thoughtful humor - some of it light, some dark.This film however always stays superficial and is very very shallow - plus - most annoyingly - very reactionary in its tone.No sir, I didn't like it!.Maybe my expections were too high?",Riders of Justice

The film doesn't reveal if the bomb was really a terrorist attack or an accident. However, there is a guy living in Egypt, who looks very much like the guy who was suspected of putting the bomb. And this Egyptian guy was on the train when the bomb exploded. No idea if he put the bomb or what his reasons were if he did.The plot is stupid, boring and the movie is too long.

There are some serious dark themes here that are exploited for our entertainment, but I wouldn't have it any other way. The movie is not only bleak for it's material, but I would say, it is especially dark because when automatic weapons are fired in high density areas , the Danish authorities just don't seem to care.It's sprinkled with a few jaw dropping scenes here and there and it mostly works. The Bodashka story ark felt a bit tacked on, but ends up working if you just accept the movie. I wish they made the main character less stubborn and more varied. Let him evolve, let him cry, let him hug. The Otto character looked so much like Seth Rogen - I can't be the only one thinking that.I also really enjoyed the commentary on atheism and statistics. Some is really clever. There is even a long scene of an absurd counselling therapy session. The writers really thought the movie through.When all the elements come together it becomes a tight fun dysfunctional movie.

It's silly, it's funny, it's weird, but it's also deep and emotional as hell.It's truly a wonderful movie that feels almost like a TV show condensed into a 1h 40min runtime, in the way that you get to know and like all the characters and hope that nothing bad happens to them while the odds of a shitstorm grow by the minute.I laughed, I shed some manly tears, and I really, really enjoyed it. It's a fun movie that never goes off the rails with its material. And Mads Mikkelsen owns it as he usually does.I usually spoil most of the plot when talking about garbage movies because I don't think you should see them and you should know why. This movie?

He's aided in his investigations by a group nerdish, social misfits who bring a heap of skills and dysfunction with them. There's an awful lot going on in the clever script: father daughter relationships, social alienation, the interplay of probability and coincidence, as well as the usual action & violence you'd expect in a film of this type. Perhaps it's a little too much content in places - the tone of the film veers wildly & disconcertingly sometimes, but overall the writing, acting & ideas are so strong that you just go with it. The cast is great - Mads Mikkelsen holds it all together with another tremendously enigmatic screen performance and is ably supported by a strong ensemble. There's plenty of laugh out loud moments, emotional engagement and shoot outs to keep the whole thing racing along & even if it's fairly obviously where things are going to end up, it's a very enjoyable ride getting there nevertheless. A notch above most other action films.",Riders of Justice

Magnetic presence and doesn't matter what kind of character he plays you simply get engaged and connected to him. Second the main cast is so well picked, complimenting eachother and then contrasting Mads character, such chemistry. Then the story, don't want to say much but it pretty much worked out for me in a more than satisfiying way. Overall original and simple story line with twists that are so not expected, again a big plus for the movie. Then the jokes. It's not a comedy that's supposed to make you laugh crying out loud. Insted it's smart comedy that makes you simply enjoy the whole show this little simpatic and clumsy team creates for us. The warm drama created is something I saw as movie hygge but that's just me not being Danish.

131,dannyc-18,Subverts the Hollywood revenge trope in surprising and endearing ways,9,6 August 2021,"This is a Danish film, with English subtitles. Military tough guy Markus (played by tough guy actor Mads Mikklesen) is away from home doing military tough guy things when his wife and daughter are in a train crash. The wife is killed and the daughter traumatized. Markus returns home to grieve and brood. Then it is brought to his attention, by another survivor of the train crash, that it may not have been an accident but instead was a bombing designed to assassinate a witness against an organized crime syndicate. Those, like Markus' wife and daughter, who died or were injured were collateral damage. Markus, aided by group of misfits, vows revenge (and has the weaponry to do it).This is the classic boilerplate Hollywood revenge trope employed in countless action films. But the makers of Riders of Justice begin subverting that trope in surprising and delightful ways. The film becomes a quirky, sympathetic, and at times very funny exploration of how we're all damaged in different ways and need others to walk with us through our pain and grief, of how the trauma we've experienced may lead us to perceive and do things that we may not even be fully aware of, of how we try with our limited perspective to find patterns and meaning within the enormous web of causality that is existence. Some surprisingly deep stuff, all delivered in an engaging and entertaining fashion (albeit sometimes gritty and dark, as one expects from a Scandinavian film). There's a lot of humanity in this film, something often missing from the action genre. All of the central characters have experienced deep trauma in their lives, which affects how they perceive events, how they react to stress, and how they interact with one another.The acting is superb. The scene showing Mikklesen's face as he gazes at his wife's body in the morgue is, all by itself, an Oscar worthy performance for what he is able to convey.Warning: there is action movie style brutality (particularly gun violence, and the requisite sadistic villain from central casting) but the use of violence to solve problems is cast as a misguided option in order to point toward something much more satisfying and transcendent.",Riders of Justice
132,mlhaddad-30253,Mads Mikkelsen,10,30 August 2021,"Mads Mikkelsen never ceases to amaze me as an actor. Definitely in the top ten worldwide for me.This a great movie thanks to his work.

That happens more often the bland moviegoers knows about.ATJ feels like a ""wannabe"" David Mamet, which is not a bad thing. Quite good if you are Danish. However, David Mamet is a thousands times better.This is a Danish movie for the Danish people - which unfortunately has no merit on the internationally movie scene - except the minority.",Riders of Justice

139,robo-83017,Excellent,8,22 April 2021,"This film contains many things: death, violence, murder, revenge, family problems, current abuse, past abuse, mental health problems . . . And comedy!With there being so many serious subjects you would think the comedy would not work, but it does - it flows naturally from some of the bizarre situations.At the heart of this film are coincidences (chaos theory?), a family tragedy and a bunch of ""misfits"" who somehow come together and ultimately help the family.A surprising, wonderful, moving film - highly recommended.The first and last scenes focus on the girl whose ""fault"" this all was. That is, I think this is meant to emphasize that her ordinary, blameless, actions started off a chain of events which led to a train wreck (which WAS just an accident) and death, and these sorts of coincidences can and do happen all the time with no real explanation.

Not for people who are looking for a serious action movie or a sad drama... it has all these elements but in the end it is mainly a ""lighthearted dark comedy"".

147,pmidha,Brilliantly dark and wickedly funny,10,26 July 2021,"Mads as you've never seen him before. After a dark and serious start, the film opens up into a wickedly dark black comedy populated by oddballs and preposterous sequences of events that add to the humour and tension. Spliced with deeply moving commentaries on relationships and on what we deem as unacceptable, the film propels us along a storyline of revenge and coming to terms with.our own issues and hang ups. Mathematical probability and chance happenings. There is a lot of pent up violence but having just read King Lear, the combination of humour and tragedy makes for a relief of tension as we are confronted with the terrible events that unfold. Gradually the comedy dissipates as the film moves to its final ""Straw Dogs"" reckoning. The story allows us to reflect on our own responsibilities. The film starts and ends with different renditions of The Little Drummer Boy and the images of a bicycle, bringing it to a fitting circular conclusion.",Riders of Justice

When watching each scene can cause a different emotion at a comedic moment you start laughing after a couple of scenes, on the contrary, you think and start to feel sad. As for the humor in the film, we can say that really not everyone from the audience will be able to understand the context of the joke itself. For residents of Scandinavia, all jokes seem familiar and are included in the agenda of young people who are fighting for our green ball, which in their opinion we should all protect.

also does a good job!The script and the lines were really well done. How the characters interact and talk to each other felt very natural, and none of it seemed ""staged"", which shines through as ATJ is one of the most talented screenwriters we have in Denmark.I found the film's unique plot and its special ""idea"" to be incredibly thrilling, and made the film have a lot of thoughtful elements, where the cinema-goer is actually challenged intellectually, which we rarely see in Danish films.All in all a great danish film!9/10.",Riders of Justice

On a more positive note, I really liked some of the characters -- especially Emmenthaler, who is obsessed with the resolution of his computer monitors and is an excellent caricature of Internet neckbeards.

209,esbenrah,Just wow,10,21 November 2020,I giggled 50% of the time. The lat 50% i was amazed by the drama and roughness og the movie. 2 hours gone in what felt æike 10 minutes.,Riders of Justice
210,eciurlionis,Very entertaining,10,23 May 2021,"Has your attention till very end. It has drama, comedy, action elements. Has unique style, maybe because of good actors. Must see.",Riders of Justice
211,ms_187,Bad move,1,20 July 2021,"Actually. The movie is very bad, the story is very weak, and the events are also very weak.",Riders of Justice
212,mark-desnoyers,What a terrific film !,10,16 August 2021,"I have never written a review on this site before.This film blew me away; one of the best I can recollect in my 61 years.An amazing cast, stellar script, directing and most of all a very human story.Deep appreciation and respect for all those involved in this project.... and I don't speak a word of Danish.",Riders of Justice

214,bogdanmtv,Something with weard point,7,17 May 2021,"The film is non-standard and in some places very good. Also, many lines are horrible and inappropriate. The screenwriters talk about Ukraine and use information about Russia.",Riders of Justice
215,nikolaoschasanis-48998,Just another mads Masterpiece.,10,7 September 2021,"Just another Masterpiece.There is some magic that makes Mikkelsen reveal his full potential on Danish\Swedish\Scandinavian productions.I'll be fair here, i am afraid of all these productions closer to home and away from hollywood, but i start to like them now, they seem closer to what Cinema should be like, not only about the box office, which i guess the producers\writers feel the same way because they clearly put some thought into them.This is the true soul of Cinema as it gives you more than usual.10\10 from Greece.",Riders of Justice
216,erhansoysalatik,upset the apple cart,7,17 April 2021,"The movie is good but the end is ridiculous. What kind of legal system is this that when you kill 20 people, you are released?",Riders of Justice
217,wcochran-34318,Complete Dud,1,8 July 2021,"I don't understand all the glowing reviews of this movie. The script was awful, characters unbelievable, and it was hard to watch. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.",Riders of Justice
218,pakic-74157,So much better than I expected when I started watching.,10,23 May 2021,"I expected movie similar to ""Taken"", where is all about blood revenge. But it's not, it so much more. They have represented ""butterfly effect"" in such a good way. Theres a lot of work on charachters, each person has different view on the world and gives a lot to think about. Just amazing work.",Riders of Justice
