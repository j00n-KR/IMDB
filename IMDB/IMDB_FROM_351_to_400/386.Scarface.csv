0,MartinHafer,Unrelentingly vile,1,8 June 2007,"I am sure that I'll probably get some nasty emails about this one, but I think SCARFACE might just be one of the worst movies of the last 25 years---especially since it is so adored by so many and been so readily accepted as a ""great film"". It is supposed to be an updated remake of the classic film of the same name from 1932 (starring Paul Muni). Despite this, the movie is sloppy and cheap. Instead of good writing and intelligent film-making, they hired Oliver Stone to write a hackneyed film. The result is a deliberate assault on the sensibilities by using the f-word again and again as well as using extreme and pointless violence throughout. It's easy to say ""f---"" and the like and it's easy to have millions spent for special effects explosions and gunfire, but these alone do not constitute a good film, as the writing was almost absent in the film and it was just a giant over-the-top parody of gangster films. It's as if DePalma's mantra for the film is ""when in doubt, have Pacino say the f-word or have him kill some people"". Also, while some have praised Al Pacino's performance, to me it seemed like ridiculous self-parody--like a dirty version of the guy he played in DICK TRACy--which, at least, was SUPPOSED to be a cartoon. None of his brilliance from THE GODFATHER is present, as he plays a buffoon. There is absolutely no subtlety, no finesse and nothing of value in the film. In fact, and I know this will again prompt some nasty emails, I really think the film is intended for a stupid and undemanding audience who actually get off on this sort of brain-rot. Avoid this like the plague--your brain will thank you for this!Ed Wood, Jr. could have made a much better film had he been given this budget.",Scarface
1,TheLittleSongbird,Didn't do anything for me,5,13 February 2011,"I love Al Pacino and I liked out of Brian De Palma's work The Untouchables, Carrie and Carlito's Way. But sorry, Scarface didn't do anything for me.While I can understand what people mean when they think it is over-produced, one of the things I did like about Scarface is that in my view it is well made. The cinematography is very good with some interesting uses of lighting, while the scenery and costumes are equally eye-popping. The music is somewhat cheesy, but it is also tolerable and some of the soundtrack choices were quite nice. In terms of acting, Steven Bauer and Robert Loggia are quite wonderful. Also De Palma's direction does have occasional flashes of brilliance, the scene with the chainsaw and the Columbian dealer is quite shocking.However, I am afraid I am one of those who didn't like Al Pacino here. Don't get me wrong, Pacino is a wonderful actor, and while I may have people telling me the excess was intentional, this particular reviewer thought that the excess got too much after a while. In short I thought Pacino overacted so wildly I found it very hard to relate to him or his character at all. The film is also much too long, has one too many scenes where it is drawn out, the script is excessively cheesy(did Tony really have to swear as much as he did?), the characters are shallow and cartoony and the story is unfocused with some unbelievable scenes(Tony's sister shooting at him while telling him to (enter obscenity) her). Also the incest is far too explicit here. In terms of other acting, Michelle Pfeiffer looks beautiful but she struggles with a poorly handled character, while F Murray Abraham is just wasted.Overall, didn't do anything for me, sorry. I much prefer the 1932 film, which was quite shocking for its time and it also handled the incest much better. 5/10 Bethany Cox",Scarface
2,Leofwine_draca,"A stone cold, 100% gangster classic",10,10 December 2016,"Words alone cannot express how much I love this movie. The first time I saw it, it blew me away. When I watched it again recently it hadn't lost any of its impact. SCARFACE is, quite simply, one of the best films in the ""gangster"" genre that there is, if not the best. The simple tale tells of Tony Montana's journey from being a lowly refugee, to working in a cheap mobile café, to working for a drug lord's assistant, to working for a drug lord, to becoming a drug lord and then losing everything due to his own mistakes.De Palma here crafts an epic tale in what I consider to be his finest film. Although it runs for over two and a half hours, this is never less than engrossing, something that is partially due to the excellent acting we have on display from the ensemble cast. Al Pacino has never been better as the volatile Tony Montana, making the role his own and his performance is a totally convincing one right down to his appearance and accent. Steven Bauer is also very good in an understated role as his partner, his role always takes the backseat when compared to Pacino's but it is still a pivotal one. Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are the addicted wife and loving sister respectively, and as both of their loves are ruined, we feel their pain with them. The supporting cast includes great turns from Robert Loggia (drug lord), F. Murray Abraham (quietly sinister), Harris Yulin (a corrupt cop) and Paul Shenar (a drug baron).The film does start slowly but the build-up is worthwhile. De Palma's trademark excessiveness turns up in the form of a number of brutal shootings and, especially, a gruelling chainsaw murder. However, all the best is saved for the wildly excessive finale which, in my mind at least, even surpasses that of THE FURY. Pacino has dug his own grave and has destroyed his business and either killed or alienated all of his friends and family. He sits alone in his huge mansion, snorting from a pile of cocaine on his desk. It is at this point a small army invade the mansion and execute all of his staff; he must then battle them alone in a bloody massacre in which the outcome is foretold. I love this ending, with all the violence it holds, and I love the way that Pacino's body is so pumped full of drugs that he doesn't even notice it when he gets repeatedly shot. Who can forget the classic line ""Say hello to my little friend!"" as he machine-guns a dozen men on his staircase. A classic, re-watchable movie with the director and stars all at the peak of their game.",Scarface
3,SnoopyStyle,Gangster violence to a whole new level,8,18 July 2014,"In May 1980, Castro releases thousands of Cuban prisoners including Tony Montana (Al Pacino) from Mariel Harbor. His friend Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer) gets a contract to kill a political prisoner for green cards for both of them. They're soon working for drug dealer Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) to double cross some Columbians. Tony takes advantage and becomes a hit-man for big boss Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). He is after Lopez's girlfriend Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer) and his whole empire. His mother (Miriam Colon) disapproves of his work and tries to separate him from his adoring sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).Al Pacino gives one of the most memorable weird performance of the world. Director Brian De Palma brings an ultra-violent sense to the material. It brings almost joy to this violent villain character. It reminds me of the old WB gangster movies where violence rules. This pushes it to an even higher level. It's a new icon of the gangster movies.",Scarface
4,Hitchcoc,One Man Show,8,3 January 2015,So many have already commented on this movie that I don't have much to add. I just want to say that this violent black comedy has one of the most memorable characters in all of movies. It's also one of the most quotable films of all time. As the immigrant Tony makes his way to the top by dropping people in huge quantities and manipulating a system that plays into his hands. He is a juggernaut and why he rises as he does when he is often clueless is quite amazing...and we buy it. Pacino takes his Corleone character to the Nth degree by pretty much taking the humanity out of him. We love him; we hate him; but we certainly can't ignore one of the most off-the-wall performances of all time.,Scarface
5,kosmasp,Say hello to my little friend,10,24 May 2020,"One of the most recognized quote from a movie ever. Even to those who haven't seen the movie. It's sort of Pacinos equivalent to De Niro ""You talkin to me?"" scene from Taxi Driver. Not comparing those movies of course. If you want to compare movies, you could compare this to the 30s original with Paul Muni. A movie that Pacino watched in a cinema and made him want this movie. Made him want to be as mesmerizing and have a powerful role. Add Oliver Stone and others to make this happen and you have an amazing movie.Now at the time it was released people were disgusted by this. Thinking of Tony Montana as role model or maybe fearing he could be just that. And he has become a cultural influence and to some an idol. The movie did not intend it or the character to be viewed as such. You can't blame the movie for how people reflect and adapt to what they see.You can blame the critics for not giving it enough credit. While the original set a standard and was used as a rough blueprint (some scenes are reminiscent of the original), this did many original things that we had not seen before, like a chainsaw scene. So not for the squeamish or the ones who are easily offended. All that taken into account it is a travesty Pacino did not win an Oscar for his performance. It's an even bigger travesty he wasn't even nominated! Actually the movie had even a Razzie nomination ... which is almost funny while simultanously sad too.The movie may be long but it needs time to unfold. It is bigger than life, has many tips of the hat to the original (the world is yours) and might be one of the few cases where the remake is at least as good as the original. Highly recommended to anyone who loves action movies and dramas combined",Scarface
6,classicsoncall,"""I ought to be pickin' gold from the streets.""",8,13 August 2012,"Let 1983's ""Scarface"" be always remembered as the film that first introduced the 'F' word firing machine gun. The first thing I did in researching the picture was to see how many times it was used, and sure enough, the word in it's various forms is used two hundred twenty six times. So if the picture runs just under three hours, that's more than one per minute. Anyone know if that's a record? Well I'd read and heard a lot about this film over the years but tonight was my first time to see it. I really wasn't all that impressed. As far as gangster films go, this didn't engage me like the ""The Godfather"", the best of them all, or even as much as a couple other personal favorites, ""Goodfellas"" and ""Miller's Crossing"". More than one reviewer here described it as over the top for it's excessive violence and Pacino's maniacal characterization of Cuban refugee turned drug lord Tony Montana, and I would concur. I guess it was OK if you go in for that kind of stuff, but I was looking for more of a compelling story to go with the mayhem and drug deals.At first I wasn't convinced that this was a remake of the 1932 movie of the same name starring Paul Muni. On reflection though, the key elements are there, including a more violent reaction by Montana to his sister Gina's (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) sexuality and the kind of men she attracted. Personally, I go for the classics in black and white so I found the original more interesting with a run time of just about half of this film. Early in the picture when he's being grilled by the authorities, Tony admits being a Bogart and Cagney fan, but I thought it would have been much cooler for the writers to insert the names of Muni and George Raft instead, both of whom were in the original ""Scarface"".",Scarface
7,gavin6942,De Palma's Masterpiece?,8,12 November 2013,"In 1980 Miami, a determined Cuban immigrant (Al Pacino) takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed.While this was inspired by the original ""Scarface"", it is not exactly a remake (something that writer Oliver Stone would not have accepted). Today, Hollywood loves remakes and ""re-imagining"" films, but they rarely get it right. This got it right -- it is so far removed from the original that the respect and influence are there without taking anything away from the classic.Apparently, De Palma was added as director when Oliver Stone was turned down for the job because of a recent flop. Who would have made the better picture? Hard to say, but it seems great that De Palma ended up with the honor -- this film is in IMDb's Top 250 and the highest-honored film in De Palma's career. If he had made nothing else, he would have gone on to be known for this for eternity. (Stone, likewise, has gone on to be best known for ""Platoon"" and ""JFK"".)",Scarface
8,lee_eisenberg,Say hello to our little film...,7,10 June 2005,"I've never seen the original ""Scarface"", but the remake is not something that you'll forget easily. Al Pacino plays Antonio Montana, one of the Cuban exiles known as ""Marielitos"". After arriving in Miami, he soon becomes a drug kingpin, distributing cocaine everywhere, not to mention getting all coked up himself. As one might expect with such a person, he gets into all sorts of bloody situations; in one scene, he and his friends commit what can only be described as the ""Florida Chainsaw Massacre"". Pretty much the whole movie shows Tony's violent escapades.I should warn you that this movie is not for the squeamish in any way, shape or form. But don't worry: the violence is not gratuitous. Overall, the movie was an interesting counterbalance to the 1980s' obsession with optimism. In ""Scarface"", all optimism is eliminated early on.Maybe it's not a masterpiece, but it is something that everyone should see just to understand Miami's mafia.",Scarface
9,jboothmillard,Scarface,8,19 March 2007,"I had heard a lot about this controversial gangster crime thriller remake of the 1932 classic, from director Brian De Palma (Carrie, The Untouchables), and written by Oliver Stone, I can definitely see the stir it has caused. Basically scar faced (from childhood) Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Golden Globe nominated Al Pacino) and his friend Manny (Golden Globe nominated Steven Bauer) start out doing small time jobs, e.g. burger stand, before being hired by Omar Suarez (Last Action Hero's F. Murray Abraham) to pay money to Columbians for some cocaine. The deal goes wrong, but they leave (after some chainsawing) with the money and coke. Soon Tony meets drug kingpin Frank Lopez (Independence Day's Robert Loggia), and falls for his new boss's girlfriend Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). He grows even bigger with power and greed when he kills Lopez and Bernstein (Bean's Harris Yulin), and he has basically become the new godfather of illegal drugs, mostly cocaine. He obviously finds out the hard way that power doesn't last, when a gang with machine guns surround his house in the great climax. With many violent moments, very strong drug use (including a pile of cocaine on the table, which Tony pretty much dunks his face in) and containing 278 swear words, one every 36 seconds, including 226 'F' words, I love it. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Giorgio Moroder. Al Pacino was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 26 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 5 (along with Robert De Niro) on The World's Greatest Actor, the film was number 61 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""Say ""hello"" to my little friend!""), and it was number 31 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Very good!",Scarface
10,ccthemovieman-1,Being A Gangster - It's Not All Glamor!,8,20 July 2006,"I found this to be an interesting character study of a Cuban who comes to Miami and becomes a big drug dealer, rising from little to become a big-shot and wealthy....and then destroy himself. The movie got panned at the time of its release for its excesses in profanity and violence....but now since we've all become desensitized with decades of this stuff, the film is now almost reaching ""cult status."" Amazing. The critics, meanwhile, loved ""Casino,"" which - profanity- wise, made ""Scarface"" sound like ""Mary Poppins."" Go figure.Nonetheless, at the time, Al Pacino (""Tony Montana"") probably set a new Hollywood record for using the f-word in a mainline film. Pacino's wife, ""Elvira"" played by the beautiful Michelle Peiffer, wasn't a lot more wholesome than her husband. She got really brutal as the film wore on.If that language is no problem, you'll find the story quite interesting and a good study of how paranoia must wind up haunting most gangsters. It's a real downside to living the live of crime. Near the end, Pacino is going to bed each night with a gun under his pillow. That's not how you want to get a good night's sleep!Anyone who thinks being a big-time crook is ""the life,"" should watch this film and pay attention. It may look like ""crime pays,"" but it doesn't. I mention all this because this movie is perfect portrayal of how the paranoia of being in the drug business can do you in, as well as other problems that can do you in. It isn't all glamor. Even Pfeiffer's great face can't mask the ugliness inside.",Scarface
11,rmax304823,Things Go Better With Coke,7,12 January 2008,"The visual imagery is strikingly different from Howard Hawks' early 1930s version, but the plot is fundamentally the same, transposed from Al Capone in Chicago in the 1920s, through Tony Camonte and prohibition in the 1930s, to Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and cocaine in Miami in the 1980s. The protagonist begins as an ethnic nobody and rises to the top before being undone by his own reach. There's a sub-plot. A Latin kid falls for a trophy blond before returning to the girl who reflects his own roots, though she may be his sister.I'm not sure about that incest business, which showed up first in a shadowy way in Hawks' film. There it was arguable. Here, with Maria Mastrantonio as Pacino's sister Gina, it's made explicit in Gina's speech before she attempt to shoot Pacino. But, I don't know. Latin culture tends to be pretty protective of its women, who are either Madonnas or whores. (And not just Latins, but other cultures as well, including Samoans.) It's the business of the brother to protect his sister's reputation. True enough, Pacino seems obsessed with Gina, and the director, Brian DePalma, emphasizes this by giving us a close-up of Pacino's glare every time he spots her with a boy friend. But then, after all, Tony kills his best friend for being with his sister, only BEFORE he discovers they're married. Sure, it's ambiguous. It's just hard to believe that what amounts to fratricide would have taken place simply because of incestuous longings.Anyway, enough incest. In Hawks' film, Tony drove an armor-plated car and lived in an armor-plated room. We only knew he was rich because everybody said so. Here, we actually SEE the opulence and, man, is it disgusting. It's ritzy in the same sense that a Las Vegas casino is ritzy, which is to say pretty vulgar. No class, you know? The production designer, glimpsing the plan, just have entered the phase of ejaculatory inevitability. And in Hawks' film there is the usual final shoot out in which the sister is accidentally shot and Tony gets his. It's dramatic but it doesn't last long. In this film it looks a little like World War III. It's not a blood bath. It's literally a swimming pool of blood. (Two of them, in fact.) ""Say hell to my LITTLE FRIEND!"", Pacino screams before triggering his grenade-launching assault rifle -- but a bullet is just a bullet after all.Pacino, playing a rogue Cuban, is kind of funny. I wonder if he played it for laughs. His accent is a kind of all-purpose Romance language dialect, edging crabwise at times into some kind of Slavic. And coke has a peculiar effect on him. Where most people get a rush of exhilaration and euphoria from doing a line or two, Pacino can shove his face into a mountain of the stuff, take a big deep breath, and emerge more sluggish and dispirited than before. Michelle Pfeiffer is the trophy blond wife. (Yummy.) If you rubbed her belly with a hundred dollar bill she'd go into tonic immobility like a chicken. I was most impressed by the performance of Arnaldo Santana as Pacino's adversary Ernie, the henchman of Robert Loggia. Pacino has just killed two of his enemies, leaving only the remaining gangster Santana standing next to Loggia's body. (Why does Loggia wear a chai?) As Pacino and his friends are walking out with their guns still asmoke, Steven Bauer glances over and asks, ""What about Ernie?"" The expressions that flit across Santana's features at that moment are priceless. He's not exactly terrified. He's just monumentally UNEASY. DePalma stages a few memorable scenes. One is an argument between him and Pfeiffer in a fancy restaurant. My ex wife was a specialist in initiating such public scenes. Another is an attempted assassination of Pacino in his own night club, in which a fat Fellini-esquire clown with a plastic head gets caught in the crossfire while prancing around to ""Strangers in the Night."" The third has Pacino in a marble tub surrounded by sycophants, booze, and bubble bath. The shoot out, with Pacino taking bullet after bullet while waving his arms and screaming vile curses, is hard to take because of its excess. (Let the guy DIE, for crying out loud!)",Scarface
12,Tweekums,Nothing exceeds like excess,9,6 March 2017,"Tony Montana came to America from Cuba in 1980 and from the moment he arrived he intended to make it big. After a month in a refugee camp he murders a man in exchange for help getting his green card. Once out he is soon working for a local drug dealer; he is unwilling to stay at the bottom of the business and is willing to risk everything to progress. He is keen to make deals, sometimes without clearing it with his boss first. He is also obsessed with his boss's girlfriend and excessively protective of his younger sister. After a few close encounters with death he soon appears to have everything he wants; the beautiful wife, the huge mansion and even a tiger chained in the garden however he forgets some of the main rules of the business; firstly 'don't get high on your own supply' and secondly don't become a liability to those higher up the food chain.This is a classic '80s gangster film; violent and excessive. Al Pacino is delightfully over the top as Tony Montana; as a character it is impossible to like him which makes it easier to enjoy his inevitable downfall. Like most of the characters he has little depth; he is just a greedy punk who thinks the world owes him a living and will do just about anything to attain it. The look of the film is also excessive with some horrendous '80s fashion; massive collars and unbuttoned shirts for the men and huge hair for Tony's sister it all looks delightfully tasteless; just like Tony and his associates who believe money must be flaunted. There is a lot of violence throughout the film; the most shocking moment being an early scene that featuring a chainsaw if you can get past that the rest of the film should be okay! There is also a lot of drug use; although this is hardly glamorised as we see the effect it has on Tony and his wife. Overall I'd recommend this if you want a dose of '80s excess; just don't expect much character depth.",Scarface
13,ma-cortes,Violent chronicle about the rise and fall of a dangerous gangster and easily ranks as one of the very best in the mobster genre,8,19 January 2013,"Remake from classical movie titled Scarface (1934) , in fact , De Palma's Scarface is dedicated to Ben Hecht and Howard Hawks. When Fidel Castro opens the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, he sends 125,000 Cuban refugees to reunite with their relatives in the United States. Among all the refugees, there is one who wants it all, his name is Tony Montana (Al Pacino reportedly stated that Tony was one of his favorites of all the characters he's played) but the world will remember him by another name , Scarface , being a fictional character . In 1980 Miami, a determined Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed . As Tony and his faithful friend Manny (John Travolta was considered for the role of Manny Ribera but was to Steven Bauer who is the only actual Cuban in the main cast and subsequently married Melanie Griffith) arrive in the U.S. and beginning working small time jobs importing and exporting cocaine. Soon, they are hired by Omar Suarez (during filming F. Murray Abraham was notified that he had won the part of Antonio Salieri in Amadeus) to do business to a group of Colombians. When the issue goes awry , Tony and Manny leave with the money and flee rapidly . Soon after , Tony meets with drug ringleader Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia , outstanding as a rival gangster) and falls for his boss's girl , Elvira (Michelle Pffeifer , Kay Lenz, Glenn Close , Kelly McGillis and Kristy McNichol both reportedly wanted the role , but De Palma turned them down). Later on , Tony reunites with his mother and sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).This exciting film packs thrills , chills , noisy action violence and results to be pretty entertaining , in spite of its long runtime , as it runs nearly three hours . It's one of the most violent , gruesome , thrilling intriguing gangster move ever made . Al Pacino , in the title role , is firs-rate as the Cuban gangster and receives magnificent support from Steven Bauer , Robert Loggia, Mark Margolis , Harris Yulin and early deceased Paul Shenar gives a bravura performance as a Colombian kingpin . Interesting screenplay by Oliver Stone who wrote this film while fighting a cocaine addiction . The original idea was to make this film a remake of Scarface, which took place in Chicago, but this proved to be impossible due to budget constraints. There was a huge controversy in the city of Miami during the making of the film over whether the producers should be allowed to shoot in the city. The Miami Tourist Board decided not to allow filming, as they were afraid the movie would discourage tourism to Miami, particularly as it showed Miami's latest Cuban immigrants as gangsters and drug dealers. A majority of the film was shot in Los Angeles, California standing in for Miami, Florida. This was done because production would have been endangered by protest from angry Cuban-Americans over the film's reported subject matter. Streets and buildings used for shooting were redressed by the art directors to have the 'feel' of Miami. The movie displays a colorful cinematography by excellent and veteran cameraman John A Alonzo . Furthermore , it has a commercial musical score composed by synthesizer by usual of the 8os , Giorgo Moroder. The motion picture was very well directed by Brian De Palma who liked the script so much that he dropped out of directing Flashdance to direct this film. Ranked #10 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Gangster"". Scarface, the version starring Paul Muni, was ranked #6 in June 2008",Scarface
14,BA_Harrison,Make way for the bad guy.,9,13 August 2015,"Recently, Calais has been under siege from refugees/immigrants fleeing Eastern Europe/Africa, desperate to get into the UK via the Channel Tunnel. This put me in mind of the opening scenes of Brian De Palma's Scarface, in which thousands of Cuban refugees flood into Florida looking for US citizenship. Time for a re-watch, methinks (any excuse).Scarface stars Al Pacino as Cuban refugee Tony Montana who, having arrived in the US, does anything it takes to live the American dream. Working for a local crime boss, Tony gradually climbs the gangster ladder of success, accruing the wealth and power he desperately seeks, eventually becoming a major player in the cocaine smuggling business—but he makes more than a few enemies along the way.Scarface, by director Brian De Palma, is a dark fable of greed, corruption, violence and power, the moral of which is that, in the end, crime never really pays, the film culminating with a nihilistic finalé in which almost nobody lives happily ever after. Oscar winner Oliver Stone's script is far from subtle, a deliberate exercise in excess; De Palma directs accordingly, with grandiose visuals and OTT violence aplenty, while star Pacino delivers a suitably larger-than-life performance, making his brutal coke-snorting Cuban one of crime cinema's most unforgettable and enduring characters.The film also benefits from solid support from Michelle Pfeiffer as Montana's love interest Elvira, Robert Loggia as Montana's crime boss Frank Lopez, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's sister Gina (owner of Florida's biggest hairdo), plus a wonderfully atmospheric synth score from Giorgio Moroder.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Scarface
15,moonspinner55,Violence for the purpose of shocking...,5,18 May 2006,"Exceptionally bloody and profane drug-mob melodrama updates the 1930s Scarface/Al Capone legend and transplants it to 1980s Florida. Political Cuban refugee (Al Pacino), liberated from his homeland by Castro in 1980 along with some 125,000 other refugees, becomes major drug-lord in Miami. Elaborately made and mounted paean to underworld crime revels in its sleaze: the sordid characters, the ultra-violent mayhem, and one particular four-letter-word. Pacino plays a Cuban drug czar like nobody else, but his barbed, swaggering performance--while audacious--is one-note and over-the-top. Oliver Stone wrote the muddled screenplay (he's never sure which way to lean) and Brian De Palma directed, rather oppressively. Paul Muni played Scarface in the 1932 version, trafficking in bootleg gin instead of cocaine...which version you prefer might depend on your tolerance for chainsaws. ** from ****",Scarface
16,Quinoa1984,"Fascinating storytelling, not so fascinating lead performance",7,7 December 2003,"Brian De Palma's Scarface, a remake of the 1932 gangster classic by Howard Hawks, changes locations to Miami where Tony Montana (Al Pacino) arrives without much going for him. Soon, under circumstances at his disposal, gets to the reign of the gangster's world of 80's cocaine, soon having a sort of empire around him that soon becomes too much to control under the influence of snow. The elements that kept me interested the most while watching this film were Brian De Palma's direction and certain aspects of Oliver Stone's adaptation on Ben Hecht's material. The direction by De Palma (which owes a little credit to the cinematography by John A. Alonzo and the splendorous production design by Ferdinando Scarfiotti) is always at an edge and style to kept the audience hooked into where the story is going even if it seems inevitable in the sort of rise, seize, and fall saga of the money dream. Even though De Palma's presenting us with a more-often-than-not despicable character in Tony Montana, the techniques aren't tiresome or boring in the near 3-hour length of the film. It was by De Palma - and Stone's script, which delivers some good, tongue-in-cheek dialog, and tries to understand the scope of the characters in this world - that I stayed through till the end of this film. There were also a couple of surprises amid the conventions (i.e. the infamous ""Chainsaw"" scene).And yet, I was not one of those who thought that Pacino's performance was something incredible. I'm sure it's been influential in the twenty years since the film's been out there (the DVD did a whole tribute special by various rappers and real-life hoodlums), but from my perspective it served as something of a big liability. The supporting roles are alright, but his bravado, heavily-dramatic style seems like it COULD fit this revised version of Paul Muni's performance. BUT the accent and accentuations he uses from start to finish become distracting, and overtly comical, very quickly. And his booming persona is misused here; I can think of at least a dozen other performances where Pacino's been able to utilize his presence and style magnificently for the sake of a picture (The Godfather movies and his movies with Sidney Lumet are great examples, but so are some of his recent films like Insomnia or even the Devil's Advocate). This isn't one of them- here he confuses theatrical, operatic acting with ridiculous showmanship. What's even more interesting to me is that Pacino and De Palma's second collaboration- Carlito's Way- was a bit more mature in dealing with the conventions within the crime genre, and found that balance of forceful directing and acting. I do recommend Scarface and yet I don't recommend it as well. There were elements about the film that kept sturdy, even gripping (the last fifteen minutes or so is rather bloody though brilliantly filmed). However the film does have a number of flaws, and not just in Pacino's work (some scenes are a little too much for me, and I get a kick out of most crime films). 6.5/10",Scarface

This gangster flick is harsh, violent, loud, gross, unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word ""f--k"" the most number of times. Almost three hours long, and yes it can get repulsive. A stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord.Also playing interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, F. Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar. Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation. He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression. This will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster. Is that powerful enough for you? Crime does not pay for long!",Scarface
18,sunwarrior13,A Classic Gangster Film,10,19 August 2013,"Scarface is a crime film that features that tells the story of a Cuban refugee who comes to Miami who becomes a drug cartel kingpin during the cocaine boom of the said decade.Al Pacino stars as Tony Montana together with Steven Bauer,Michelle Pfeiffer,Robert Loggia and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay and Brian De Palma directed the movie which was an update of the 1932 classic of the same title that was written by Ben Hecht and directed by Howard Hawks.Tony Camonte, the Italian-American Chicago gangster in the 1932 classic, is now called Tony Montana.He is a small-time Cuban punk, one of supposedly hundreds among the 125,000 or so legitimate refugees that the Castro Government allowed to immigrate to Florida in the spring of 1980. Quick- witted, hollow-eyed Tony Montana hasn't one redeeming feature, but his greed and ambition are so all-consuming that they are heroic in size if not in quality.He has absolutely no compunction about murdering for profit, which quickly endears him to a Batista Cuban refugee who is the chief of the Bolivia-to-Florida cocaine traffic,later works his way up and succeeds his former mentor.He,too marries the now-dead man's mistress, Elvira.This is one of the best gangster films ever made.It's cool, it's violent, it's scary and it's unforgettable.It's a whole new spin on the immigrant story and the American Dream as an underworld nightmare as it tells the rise and fall of an immigrant who has chosen to engage in criminal activities. The façade of family loyalty, underworld authority and the mob code is trampled in the feral battle to get to the top of the cocaine mountain as the Tony Montana character robs and murders his way to riches and power, and then numbs himself into a fantasy of invulnerability with his own product.The performances in this film was excellent in this film.Al Pacino does not make Montana into a sympathetic character, but he does make him into somebody we can identify with, in a horrified way.Also,it has a wonderful gallery of excellent supporting cast: Steven Bauer as a sidekick, Michelle Pfeiffer as a woman whose need for drugs leads her from one wrong lover to another, Robert Loggia as a mob boss who isn't quite vicious enough, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, as Pacino's kid sister who wants the right to self-destruct in the manner of her own choosing.And most of all,it is a movie that understands crime personality for it portrays laziness and ruthlessness, grandiosity and low self-esteem, pipe dreams and a chronic inability to be happy inspite of being abundantly wealthy.",Scarface

20,Theo Robertson,A Good Film In Parts But One With Serious Flaws,6,8 October 2003,"Some reviewers point out that when you remember a movie from several years ago your memory blocks out all the bad things leaving only good memories of it . I mainly disagree with this view point . With the exception of some DOCTOR WHO stories everything I remember , either good or bad , about a film or TV show from yesteryear seems to be confirmed when seeing it today . There are exceptions to this and one of them is SCARFACE
I first saw this in the early 1990s and can vividly remember the performances , dialogue and gut wrenching violence . I saw it a second time a few days ago which did confirm that my memory of great performances and dialogue had been correct . However I`d seem to have forgotten all about serious flaws the film has First is the rather annoying operatic feel of the movie , everything is grandiose and over the top . Every set is massive as the camera pans out showing us the sets . People don`t just take a line of cocaine , they fall face down in a massive mound of the drug . People don`t fall down after being killed , they almost explode in a sea of red stuff while the final climatic shoot out becomes laughably OTT The second flaw is Tony Montana`s motivation . He cares about children deeply ( It`s this that leads to his downfall ) but nothing in Oliver Stone`s script explains why he`s so caring about little ones . It`s an obvious redemption plot . He cares . End . No explanation . It`s never really explained either why Tony wants to keep his sister away from all men
As I said SCARFACE does have some really good points . I never once thought I was watching Pacino act because Pacino IS Montana and all the other performances are good . Despite the flaws of the script the dialogue is highly quotable with lines like "" I bet you aint been f***ed all year "" and "" Say hello to my little friend "" . A shame the gut wrenching violence is too overblown to be credible or disturbing . A good film but I can`t help thinking at the end of the day CARLITO`S WAY is a much better movie",Scarface
21,Hey_Sweden,The world is yours.,8,10 February 2019,"In this notorious 1980s update of the 1932 gangster classic, Al Pacino is tremendously entertaining in the role of Tony Montana. Tony is a lowlife sent by Castro's Cuba to North America along with much more decent, hard-working and honest Cubans. As an immigrant, he's determined to take the quickest route to wealth and success, no matter who has to get hurt along the way. With Manny Ray (Steven Bauer) as his constant sidekick, he works his way into the position of a reigning drug lord in Florida.It may be simply a matter of personal taste how one responds to this admittedly grim and utterly nasty ode to crime and pathological greed. Tony is absolutely nobody to admire (although his exploits have since gone on to inspire a number of gangsta rappers), and is pretty much as bad an antagonist as you can see in this sort of entertainment. He's crude, aggressive, foul-mouthed, and incredibly brutal.Yes, the film does go on for almost three hours, and yes, it amounts to almost three hours' worth of excess. But, as Tony's junkie trophy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) says, ""nothing exceeds like excess"". Some viewers may find it over the top and an unrelenting exercise in repulsing the viewer, but this viewer found it a blast; he tried never to take it too, too seriously.There's tons of gunfire and tons of blood before this is over, not to mention some great production design, widescreen photography, and gaudy 1980s fashions. The soundtrack is another plus, with a haunting electronic score composed by 80s favourite Giorgio Moroder.As the saying goes, ""Scarface"" is about ""as subtle as a sledgehammer"", really driving home the point that, ultimately, crime doesn't pay.Pacino is commanding as always as the flamboyant main character, ridiculous ""Cuban"" accent and all. His ""Say hello to my little friend!"" moment has been a part of movie folklore for decades now. He's surrounded by very fine actors: Bauer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (as the impressionable younger sister of whom Tony seems unnaturally fond), Miriam Colon (great in two scenes as Tony's disapproving mother), Robert Loggia (who's terrific in his final scene), Harris Yulin, F. Murray Abraham, Paul Shenar, Pepe Serna, Mark Margolis, Michael Alldredge, etc. Richard Belzer appears briefly as an M.C. at a club.Trashy beyond belief, ""Scarface"" is undeniably vivid and can boast a particularly exciting finale. It's far from filmmaker Brian De Palmas' best work, but it's certainly one of his best known.Even at two hours and 50 minutes, it rarely gets boring.Eight out of 10.",Scarface
22,LeonLouisRicci,A Crazy Coked Up Dream,8,28 January 2013,"There is nothing about this movie that is subtle. It is a blow-hard, in-your-face character study of an immigrant's imaginations. In fact, everything he attains on his way to the top of the world is first ""articulated"" by his creation of what he has coming and is determined to get.""What has he got that i don't"" says the dishwasher Tony Montana before he makes his first move and what a move it is. That is only the beginning and the rest is cult movie lore. It is a movie of undeniable chutzpah. There is much here that is embarrassing and much that is like ""some crazy coked up dream"".It is a colorful collage of Pulp and surreal settings. Nothing here looks real, just something out of a paperback world of grotesque characters spouting vile verbiage. It buries the viewer in a land of creeps that, of course, are more unsympathetic then are barely likable Anti-Hero.The Director's smooth self-conscious style is roughed up here by jarring profane jargon and an unsettling Underworld of unpleasantness. Ultimately it is an undertaking of undesirables and ruthless ruffians. It is a pretty-ugly world laid bare with some gripping set-pieces and it is a movie you will either love or hate and it is deserving of either because it is both lusciously bold and relentlessly repugnant.",Scarface
23,dbborroughs,25 years on the film is now more a parody than reality,6,22 March 2009,"Unintentionally Hilarious but viscerally moving about Tony Montana from Cuba who comes to the US, becomes a drug lord, a junkie and dies in a spectacular shoot out. Brian DePalma's film remaking the Howard Hawks film from the 1930's works on some levels despite being so silly as to become a comedy. Blame Oliver Stone who's script is overly ripe. And Blame the cast who over acts like there is no tomorrow.I saw the film on Christmas day 1983 and was floored by it, even though I knew some of it was silly.(I thought it was one of the best films ever made) Watching it again for the first time in a couple of years I was horrified at how bad the film is. Yea the underlying themes and such are there but its so jumbled I'm amazed that anyone takes the film seriously. I have no idea why Montana is an icon for the todays gangsters since he is such a joke, unless they don't see it that way, or perhaps its like a childhood friend who loved the Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, or rather the rise, he totally ignored the fall. An important movie in the history of film simply because its become such a cultural touch stone. I think its now a violent joke.",Scarface
24,utgard14,Brought To You By the Letter F,7,5 August 2014,"Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) works his way up through the underworld of Miami with his friend Manny (Steven Bauer) to build a drug empire. Hyper-violent remake of the 1932 Howard Hawks classic is not for the faint of heart but is lots of fun for those who don't take it too seriously. More style than substance but this is Brian De Palma, after all. The Oliver Stone script is full of memorable lines, not to mention an epic number of F bombs. Al Pacino's performance is amusingly over the top. Michelle Pfeiffer is very sexy. It's not a subtle movie and it certainly won't make you ponder the great mysteries of life. But it's very entertaining and, for a remake, surprisingly fresh.",Scarface
25,lastliberal,A mountain of excess,8,25 April 2007,"There is so much on the surface of this movie that it is difficult to get to the real story.I didn't count the number of times that Tony Montana (Pacino) uses the work f*ck or motherf*cker, but I do not believe there is another movie out there that tops it. I have heard that after 20 years, The Devil's Rejects may now have the title, but I haven't seen that, The violence is over the top also. The shower scene with the chain saw is most memorable, but the end is also bloody.Drug use? I have never seen a mountain of coke like the one on Tony's desk. he literally wallowed in it.But, underneath all of that, there is a story of a man who was a loser. A man who did everything to the extremes to hide the fact that he was so shallow and a failure. His relationships, if you could call them that, we superficial. His mother knew the truth. Apparently, she was the only one.I highly recommend watching this movie on broadcast TV after you see it on DVD. Without all the language, you can see some of the real story that makes this Pacino's greatest film.",Scarface
26,zardoz-13,One of the Seminal Crime Films of the 1980s!,10,14 June 2010,"Brian De Palma's contribution to crime movies is a splendid but extended remake of the Howard Hawks classic that toplined Paul Muni. Al Pacino of ""The Godfather"" trilogy plays the eponymous Cuban refugee sent to America during the infamous Mariel wave of boat people when Castro emptied his jails. This lengthy but engrossing drama depicts how the protagonist made it to the top of the world. When they made this movie in 1983, the producers probably had no idea about either the controversy that would erupt during the lensing in south Florida or the ultimate cult status that this corrosive tragedy would generate. Eventually, the film stirred up so much ill feeling that Universal had to complete the shooting in California. De Palma and scenarist Oliver Stone took one of the three greatest crime movies of the century and exploited a historical event to make their gangsters reminiscent of the immigrant gangsters during the era of the first ""Scarface"" movie. Indeed, at one point, Tony Montana explains that he learned English because his American father took him to see Humphrey Bogart and James Cagney movies. Considering that the film runs just shy of three hours, the filmmakers do a good job of balancing the violent empire building scenes with Tony's domestic life. Composer Giorgio Moroder's disco soundtrack is surely one of the classics. Lenser John A. Alonzo's widescreen color photography is elegant. Squeamish people should probably avoid this trigger-happy, shoot'em up saga, the chainsaw scene in the bathroom of a motel is pretty gory stuff.Our protagonist Tony (Al Pacino) rises from the streets literally after he performs a murder for Miami drug dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia of ""Prizzi's Honor"") and obtains a greed card for his closest pal Manny (Steven Bauer of ""Raising Cain"") and himself. They start out a dishwashers for a street vendor, but it doesn't take them long to put on their suits and ties and then they never look back. Later, Lopez henchman Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham of ""Amadeus"") offers Tony and Manny $500 to unload a marijuana boat. Tony thinks the deal stinks; he has heard $1000 was that the going price for unloading pot. Omar winds up offering them a bigger paycheck. If they can pick up twp keys of cocaine from a gang of Colombians arriving in Miami, Tony and Manny can earn $5000. Tony and Manny along with a couple of their Cuban buddies pull up to the Sun Ray Motel, and life is never the same afterward Tony enters the room. The Colombian and Tony play cat and mouse to start with, but things change quickly when the Colombians demand to see Tony's money is. They grab Tony's back-up man Angel Fernandez (Pepe Sernaat of ""Honeysuckle Rose"") the door and cut him up with the chainsaw before Manny bursts in the room with a machine gun and blasts away at everybody in sight. The evil Colombian chieftain who wielded the chainsaw tries to escape, but Tony chases him down in the middle of the street in front of everybody and puts a bullet in his head. Not only does Tony bring Lopez the coke but also the money. Lopez takes an immediate liking to Tony, and Tony sets his sights on Lopez's slinky but gorgeous squeeze, Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer of ""The Hollywood Knights""), but she seems more intent on snorting cocaine. Lopez assures Tony that if he flies straight with him that he will enjoy a long, happy life. He tells him that the biggest problem that Tony will face is what to do with all the stinking money. Lopez sends Omar and Tony to South America to talk with a major drug-lord Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar of ""The End of August"") about cocaine. Sosa smells a rat and has Omar taken up in a helicopter and thrown out with a noose around his throat. According to Sosa, Omar had informed on a couple of drug dealers. Predictably, Lopez is furious when Tony comes back with Omar and has a deal of a lifetime for Lopez that the crime kingpin cannot afford to buy. Tony assures Lopez that he can make up any difference in the lack of money by going out and hitting the streets. When Lopez argues that the Diaz brothers won't take kindly to Tony's ambitious movie, Tony erupts in a rage at Lopez. He is prepared to kill anybody that gets in his way. Lopez puts a contract out on Tony and two killers try to mow him down at the Babylon Club. Tony and his men kill both Lopez and Tony takes Elvira as his wife. He buys an estate, sets up a real estate business, and lives large, installing a 24-hour security monitoring system at his home. Ironically, Tony's affection for children bring him down along with his ferocious coke habit. When the cartel finds itself in the spotlight because of an anti-narcotic activist, Sosa appeals to Tony to help them. Tony is facing a stretch in prison, but Sosa assures him that he will come out clean if he helps his non-English speaking killer murder the activist with a car bomb. Tony betrays Sosa and kills his man when the man tries to blow up the activist's car with the man's wife and two children. Sosa hits back with a gang of gunmen who descend on Tony's estate.The themes of trust, greed, betrayal and cocaine abuse permeate Oliver Stone's screenplay, and he has penned some memorable dialogue. ""Nothing exceeds like excess,"" Elvira observes as she snorts some coke. The performances are all excellent, especially Loggia. De Palma and Stone carefully stage a terrific finale when dozens of armed Colombians attack his home and he breaks out a deadly assault rifle with a rocket launcher.",Scarface
27,Boba_Fett1138,Al Pacino makes it a must see.,8,22 May 2005,"Even though this movie ain't no ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas"", this movie is still a bit of a classic because Al Pacino as the famous character Tony Montana.The movie is far from flawless but it still is simply one of those movies you must have seen at least once in your life. Reason for this is simply because of the character Tony Montana and the famous shootout at the ending.This movie once more shows that Al Pacino was and still is one of the best movie actors of all time. I mean this guy played roles like this before but he still manages to play an highly original and memorable character. Further more Michelle Pfeiffer surprised me with her role in this, I never expected to see her in a role like this and was impressed with her.Fans of the gangster genre will absolutely love this movie. However if you are a De Palma fan expecting a typical De Palma movie with De Palma style, you better skip this one. There are only about 2 or 3 typical De Palma moments in the movie but even those moments don't really have De Palma style written over it. There however still is a typical edge-of-your seat De Palma scene in this movie but I won't think that's enough to please the fans.The movie's story is a bit too complex at times, mainly because of the many names mentioned in the movie and the ending, although it is a highly memorable scene is still a bit of a disappointment in terms of that it didn't really fitted the movie. It wasn't the right ending for this movie you may say.The dreadful 80's music makes this movie look more outdated than it really is and Giorgio Moroder's musical score is also not exactly likable or memorable.I'm beginning to sound negative but this movie still is a very good one. Like I said before, if you can appreciate gangster movies you'll absolutely adore this movie. It has some good hard scene's, tough characters and plenty of big guns (say hello to my little friend!). So basically the movie has everything a good gangster movie needs!A bit of a classic, because of Pacino and the shootout.

29,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"A good, convincing portrayal of a fictional Cubans rise to power in the underworld of America",8,8 August 2004,"After watching this again, I realize that I may have praised this film a little too much. Therefore, this is the more down-to-earth review. A lot of people compare this film to Godfather; granted, there are similarities, but Godfather is the better film. The entire Godfather trilogy(apart from possibly part III) is better than this film, as a whole trilogy and as individual films. Godfather has the better actors, the better script and the better film, as a whole. Sure, Scarface has some good talents, a somewhat good script, and is a pretty good film, but it doesn't compare to the greatness of Godfather. The plot is good, it has a pretty good pace, and it's fairly interesting. The acting is good, with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer giving pretty good performances, and most of the rest being reasonably good. The thing is, Scarface is more of an action film than a regular crime-drama; it has a body-count several times the size of the one that Godfather has. What you make of that is up to you, but personally I prefer quality over quantity. Every time someone was ""hit"" in one of the Godfather films, it was special, and often unique. There were several actual shoot-outs in this film, and it quickly got fairly uninteresting, as they didn't have the intensity of a regular action film, and felt a little out of place in a crime-drama. The overall tone of this film was more violent than Godfather's tone, and, at times, the film felt like it was mainly about putting in as much graphic violence as possible. It was good, no doubt about that, it just wasn't great. I have yet to see the original Scarface, but I hear it's much better, so I'll have to check it out soon. All in all, a pretty good gangster film, pretty good crime-drama, but just inferior to Godfather. Watch it to get a good, gritty and nothing less than realistic view on organized crime in the 1980's. Listen to the great theme, maybe be shocked at the gruesome violence, and learn, that ultimately, crime doesn't pay. I recommend this to fans of gangster movies and crime-dramas, fans of Brian De Palma(I guess, though I can't really remember what else he's done that's worth watching), and people who are interested in films about organized crime. Worth checking out. 8/10",Scarface
30,ferguson-6,The eyes never lie,8,21 September 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Had not seen this since its theatrical release in 1983.  Now 20 years later, I couldn't resist the theatrical re-release. Bigger screen and better sound only enhance the experience of Pacino's most dynamic screen performance.  20 years ago I found this to be a frightening film - almost overwhelming.  The periodic laughter from the audience was the telling sign of how times have changed.  We have become numb to the violence and drug abuse.  However, PLEASE note, this is NOT A MOVIE FOR KIDS.  There were at least 6 kids under 10 years old in the theatre.  Yes, times have changed, but not that much!  Michelle Pfeiffer's performance looks even better now as the lonely ice queen of the drug lords. Watching Stephen Bauer reminds me that I predicted stardoom for him 20 years ago.  Oh well, can't always be right.  Oliver Stone's screenplay is excellent and for the most part, this is DePalma's best direction.  However, in usual DePalma fashion, he goes over the top every time he wants to emphasize Pacino's anger.  The close-ups of the eyes and the increased volume would be necessary for a lessor actor, but not Pacino in his prime. Overall, the film captures the gluttony and larceny and desperation and danger of the drug underworld.  Maybe the players have changed in 20 years, but it remains a problem.  This film has turned into a very entertaining (yet violent) expose on drug traffiking.",Scarface

Al Pacino plays a Cuban refugee named Tony Montana who arrives in Miami Florida in 1980. He eventually enters the crime wave quickly rising to the top as a feared mob figure. This is a different direction for Brian De Palma who previously made the entertaining thrillers Dressed to Kill and Sisters. Pacino is a commanding force whose jealous rage earns him enemies, and destroyed relationships. The screenplay details his up rise but also delivers a riveting climax where enemies storm his mansion with a thirst for blood and revenge, and Montana hoisting a large gun in challenge, ""Say hello to my little friend!"" Michelle Pfeiffer plays his wife whom he charmed away from a former boss but she eventually leaves the chaos. Steven Bauer plays partner in crime Manny who makes the mistake of becoming romantically involved with Montana's sister.

32,HotToastyRag,Impossible to dislike,7,29 January 2019,"After you've seen the remake of Scarface, you can completely understand why the original has escaped everyone's memory, even though it propelled a brand-new actor into instant stardom in 1932. You can also completely understand why Al Pacino sealed his fate to forever play bad guys. Even during the rare instances where he wasn't cast as the bad guy, his character was still given an edge or a shady past. After playing Michael Corleone and Tony Montana, it's just impossible to play a completely good guy.If you can stomach the violence, you have to watch this movie. It's one of those modern classics that gives you goosebumps during the first scene, since it's so clear you're watching movie magic. Obviously, if intense and frequent violence upsets you, you have my full understanding. Stick to your non-violent guns and never let anyone pressure you into seeing this movie. This is a man's movie, with a completely masculine protagonist who rises to the top of the crime world through drugs, violence, a raging temper, and a penchant for beautiful women. It also has one of the most memorable shootouts in screen history. When Al Pacino says, ""Say hello to my little friend!"" he's not inviting Michelle Pfeiffer into his bedroom. Ladies, you're much better off renting Frankie and Johnny.Fellas, you're going to find yourself a new favorite movie the first time you rent Scarface. I had countless friends in college who cited this movie as one of their all-time favorites, even the pretentious guys who valued art above all else. It's such a classic that it's impossible to dislike, even if you hate it. My mom, who is very much a lady and doesn't like violence, has repeatedly praised the effort of the film and Al Pacino's wonderful performance. See what I mean? It's just impossible not to appreciate this Cuban extension of The Godfather, with a flawless performance by the ultimate gangster.I used to have ""movie star parties"" when I was in school, and the lucky youngster who got to play Al Pacino enjoyed reciting his lines so much, and we all loved seeing him recreate the ""say goodnight to the bad guy"" speech that was so memorable from Scarface. There's so much from the movie that you'll remember, from the bottomless piles of cocaine, to the borderline incestuous relationship between Al and his sister Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, to Al's endlessly mimicable accent, to Michelle Pfeiffer's beauty that's so exquisite, you think you might go blind if you look at her for too long.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

35,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Scarface,9,4 February 2011,"Even if you have never seen Scarface the movie, you may have heard about its notoriety for having some of the most F-bombs uttered on film, and one of the most violent of all time with more than two thousand bullets fired and pumped into the bodies of victims, and that infamous chain saw dismemberment scene which in all honesty pales in comparison to lesser made torture porn flicks, and frankly, it isn't explicit, and that goes to show the brilliance in the filmmaking that allowed you to feel all the same.Directed by Brian De Palma from a script written by Oliver Stone, Scarface is a remake of sorts of an old 30s Hollywood film now updated for the early 80s, set against the historical event when Fidel Castro's Cuba allowed Cubans to flood to the USA, but more so allowing prisoners from his jails to set sail for its neighbour. As such, this accounts for an expected increase in problems since you now have more people in your land but not as much opportunities being presented, and a life of crime is always enticing for one to go into when forced into a corner. And for Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and his best friend Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer), such is their introduction into a new life set about by their circumstances as new immigrants.The film chronicles the meteoric rise of the foul mouthed Tony Montana from the lowest of the pecking order of a drug cartel, to his gaining of trust and proving of his usefulness to mob boss Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), before breaking it all off to fund his own racket with ties linked to Bolivia's drug baron Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar), making tons of money, gaining plenty of influential power and the love of one his ex-boss' moll Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), before falling prey to the long held mantra that one does not dabble into the bad habit one trafficked in, thus paving the way for increased paranoia to an inevitable, dramatic and violent downfall.It puts under the microscope in some ways, a skewed scrutiny of the failed American dream, where it's applied to a life of crime with hard striving young men seeking the good life through shortcuts, seeing the money dished out by the barons as something to aspire to should they work at it in the same industry, where violence is part and parcel of the game to gain turf or get rid of competition. There's no right or wrong here since the authorities and help are easily available through the greasing of the right palms, where one can come to the country with nothing, and make it right to the top with the right connections and attitudes. But as they say, the power of greed knows no bounds, and Al Pacino delivers a crazy, one hell of a kind performance as the cocksure Tony Montana from Cuba, eager to make it big in the world, and has only his balls and guts to rely on in his forceful barge into the big league of gangsters. Ruthless to the core with little positives to his character, Pacino portrays this gangster quite unlike the more quiet intellect required in his Godfather Michael Corleone role, and is in full contrast here though both also deal with his characters' ascension to power. Pacino owns Tony Montana in the way that can probably never be replicated, and goes down in cinematic history as one of the most foul-mouthed gangsters ever to grace the big screen. Steven Bauer puts up a commendable job as his right hand man Manny, though he disappears midway into the film before popping up in the last act, and a pity that the story didn't go beyond its potential of how this character could have, or not, had the world at his feet.The two actresses in Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio were really like gangster molls, seen and not heard for the most parts, except for the latter who as Gina Montana, Tony's sister, also undergo a transformation like her brother, though hers is for the worst. Introduced as sweet, nubile and full of innocence, we see how easy money from her brother's coffers turn her into what he loathes, and there's really that unnecessary hint of crossing that incestuous suggestion toward the end, which thankfully stopped at that. Michelle Pfeiffer was completed wasted as Elvira the classic gangster moll, a crack cocaine addict who preens and purrs most of the time, offering little except to look pretty in skimpy clothes.Brian De Palma remains one of my favourite directors, and I've always associated him with a slickness in quality in his presentation. Scarface is no different, as he directs this violent epic filled with excesses and opulence to capture the spirit of the times and of the flamboyance of its characters, in a kind of operatic fashion laced with tragedy and poetic justice. While some aspects of the film didn't withstand the test of time, with the limit on how technology could have enhanced a scene through visual effects, De Palma though has crafted enough scenes on the whole to make Scarface one really memorable gangster film to have plenty of stuff to remember it by, and Stone's script has plenty of wonderful, iconic one liners that put Tony Montana on the pedestal with other contemporary gangster characters.",Scarface
36,Mr-Fusion,Lays it on pretty thick,5,4 August 2013,"Walking away from ""Scarface"", I can't shake the feeling this is an operatic comment on the American dream, by way of a gangster movie at least; that an immigrant can climb his way from societal dreg to drug kingpin and get the girl on the way. That's powerful cinematic stuff, and I can appreciate that. I guess my problem is in the execution; Pacino's cartoonish performance, the drawn-out narrative, the unbelievably overbearing score. It's got a good cast and the personnel behind the camera is accomplished, but subtlety and nuance are not its virtues. Which I guess is the point, but it gets old after a while.""Scarface"" has quite the influential legacy (particularly ""Miami Vice"" and Rockstar Games), and for that I'm grateful.

The story takes place during the time when President, Jimmy Carter allowed many people from Cuba to come into the United States; and some of these people were hardened criminals, who had other interests rather than making an honest way of making a living. Tony Montana started out washing dishes, however, his interest went to making a fast buck and being a sort of politician at the same time. Michelle Pfeiffer,(Elvira Hancock) catches the eye of Tony Montana and he sets one of his goals on going to bed with her and owning her body and soul.

41,MovieAddict2016,The definitive film chronicling the rise and fall of a man seeking the American Dream...,9,16 October 2003,"""You wanna play rough? Say hello to my little friend!"" - Tony Montana, a.k.a. Scarface.""Scarface"" chronicles the life of a Cuban refugee who came to America in May, 1980, when Fidel Castro opened the harbor at Mariel Bay, Cuba, with the apparent intention of letting some of his people join their families back in America. As the movie's opening intro explains, it soon became obvious that Castro was doing little more than sending the scum of Cuba to America in hopes of ridding his domain of filth. Of the 125,000 Cubans who came to America that year, an estimated 25,000 had criminal backgrounds.Antonio Montana (Al Pacino) was one of those criminals who came to America from Cuba and successfully set up his own kingdom of cocaine, wealth and greed. We see him in the first few minutes of the film being interviewed by police regarding his background. He's asked about the scar that stretches from his eyebrow down to his cheek. He gives all the right responses and is sent off to a quarantine camp along with his long-time friend, Manny (Steven Bauer). After murdering a man in the camp as a favor for a Mafia kingpin named Frank (Robert Loggia), the two buddies are given green cards and released from the camp. Eventually they land another job for Frank. Their wealth and greed starts to grow.Every time we see Tony Montana he is a bit better off. Better clothes, better means of transportation. He visits his mother at her small little home in Miami to show off his fortune. He tries to give her money but she says that people like him give bad names to the hard-working Cubans (like herself) who have come to America and work legitimately for a living.But Tony's sister, Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) doesn't think so. She adores her brother and accepts 1,000 dollars from him as a present. But it backfires--soon Gina is hanging out in the fancy clubs and getting felt up by men. Tony sees this and anger lights up in his eyes like fire. This happens twice in the movie. Both times are in regards to his sister. Manny explains to Gina that Tony doesn't want her to turn out like him because she is the only thing pure left in his life.Soon Tony is so powerful that he overthrows Frank and marries his girl (Michelle Pfeiffer), who becomes so depressed that she sleeps all day and snorts all night. ""Nothing exceeds like excess. You should know that, Tony.""""Scarface"" is based on Howard Hawks' 1932 film of the same title that starred Paul Muni as the title character. Both movies were accused of being overly violent. Both characters from the films had a strange infatuation with their sisters. Both characters fell in love with their boss' girlfriend. But the similarities end there. The 1932 version was not about a Cuban, it was not about an empire built on drugs, and it was not very similar by any account. Al Pacino said that Muni's performance inspired him to become Tony Montana. And while some critics accuse Pacino's performance of being over the top and too flamboyant, think about this: His character is a Cuban refugee who came to America and killed people for a living before taking over an empire built on drugs and crime. He lives in fear of not only others but himself. As his life proceeds he snorts cocaine so often that he can barely think. Then he has the underlying guilt of his life bearing down on his shoulders. How over the top would you act?The movie was written by Oliver Stone, who completed a final draft after many attempts by other writers, including one attempt by the director of the movie, Brian DePalma, who claims that his script was not going the way he wanted it to go. Stone made the story his, and succeeds on almost all levels of storytelling. Back when ""Scarface"" was released drugs, violence and big blowouts at the end of a movie were hardly run-o'-the-mill. The 160 + F-words in the film were not exactly standard, either. But the story is involving and sad. It is the best film about the American Dream ever made. Tony Montana wanted the world, and when he finally got what he wanted, he realized that even the world was not enough. Perhaps the best and most important scene in ""Scarface"" is the subtlest one--when Tony is sitting at his desk after he has killed Manny. He has everything he ever dreamed about and wanted in front of him--drugs, drinks, a luxurious mansion, a beautiful wife. Yet it isn't enough for him. And the reason he sits there in silence for so long is because it is then that he realizes happiness does not come from material wealth, but from the inside. And, to be honest, Tony Montana doesn't really have much of a soul inside. And he knows it.
""Scarface"" opens with its own theme song and closes with it, as well. It is more than just coincidence--when it is played in the beginning of the movie, it is during the time of Mariel Bay, and hope is everywhere for criminals. When it plays at the end, we have witnessed the American Dream from start to finish. When it plays at the end, there is no hope left for anyone.

42,Red-Barracuda,Nothing exceeds like excess,10,18 May 2012,"It's no surprise really that this film is the most iconic gangster film of the 80's. This decade is synonymous with excess and a certain bad taste. Scarface epitomised these factors, it clearly connected with the times. Everything about the film is over the top, be it performances, dialogue, drug taking or violence. It's highly stylised, with smooth camera-work, elaborate sets and a striking sense of colour. All things considered, it's a definitive crime film of its decade.It's a loose remake of the 30's Howard Hawks film of the same name. It shares the rise and fall narrative but with a veneer of ultra-violence. Unlike revisionist gangster flicks such as The Godfather it doesn't end with the gangster at the height of his powers, instead it adopts the rise and fall structure of the 30's gangster films. In this sense, Scarface is a combination of old fashioned narrative, with 80's excess. It's director Brian De Palma was no stranger to controversy of course, with several infamous violent films under his belt, such as the highly stylised slasher Dressed To Kill. He was pretty fearless when it came to this kind of thing and he was ably supported with a script from Oliver Stone, who would of course go on to become a confrontational director himself. Clearly it would be insane not to acknowledge the input of star Al Pacino. His depiction of Tony Montana remains one of the most quoted film characters of them all, and overall it is a tour-de-force performance.Scarface is more than anything a highly entertaining movie. It always looks great, has an appropriately synthetic score from Gorgio Moroder and has plenty of bloody violence. The whole chainsaw sequence with the Colombians remains an incredibly intense and brilliantly staged scene. But it also has an interesting historical context with Montana arriving along with a mass of Cuban exiles, who indeed really did arrive in Florida to flee Fidel Castro's communist regime. So it's also a look at the way a foreign criminal tried to live the American Dream. It could only really end one way.",Scarface

44,thesar-2,Wake up to see his little friend,5,1 March 2009,"I probably shouldn't have waited so long to see one of the most popular mobster and Al Pacino movies of all time, 'Scarface' (1983) for the first time last night. Enormously dated, 'Scarface' probably would've been more enjoyable during the ""Cuba"" scare, tail end of the disco era and ""excess of the 80s"" period. What 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas' had going for them, was they were both already period piece movies (and much more enjoyable than 'Scarface.') I realize 'Scarface' was a remake, and Oliver Stone and Brian De Palma seemed to want to take a new, ""updated"" present day take on the older ""Al Capone"" story line, but they didn't seem to make it timeless. Such as, for someone who's never seen 'Casino' or 'Goodfellas' and finally decide to view them, it would be as if they saw it for the first time in the 1990s. 'Scarface' pretty much had to be seen in/around 1983 to be completely enjoyed. Also, it might have been more shocking with all the F-bombs, violence and unpredictability of the rise/fall of a madman mobster. This is not to say it was a bad movie and Pacino did pretty good, though at times hard to understand and like most of his movies, he looks half-asleep throughout. It's three hours and even though any movie buff knows where it's going and what scenes to look for (amateur, rise, excess, fall, etc), it still was interesting to see what a lot of guys call a ""classic."" Recommended, but not over 'Casino' and 'Goodfellas.' Side note: I've already heard the line ""Say hello to my little friend,"" 600x before, I couldn't help but wait the entire movie to see the scene that made Pacino's line so famous. Luckily, it was one of the times he appeared awake.",Scarface
45,Robert_duder,"Riveting, sweeping, violent...masterpiece",9,14 January 2014,"Well here I am....1500 reviews. Clearly I watch too many movies...and couldn't care less. I love them, eat them up and I've seen many amazing (and many awful) and even more in between those two films in the last 1500. The last few milestones of reviews I've hit I was determined to watch and review Scarface because its one of those movies that people go ""You haven't SEEN that!!"" Nope I hadn't seen it. But I knew 1500 was going to be it, I was going to watch THEE Scarface. I heard good things, I heard terrible things so I went in with mixed expectations. I knew there was the possibility of me hating it, but I didn't, not for a minute.Scarface is not a perfect experience and I absolutely understand why some people don't like it. Its a massive film clocking in at (what I believe is a mostly unnecessary) 3 hours. There is a lot of business, a lot of dialogue, and as one review pointed out it is quintessential 80's. It reeks of the 80's from the mostly unknown, less popular soundtrack, to the clothing, to the Discotheques and beyond. Parts of it do indeed seem unintentionally funny or at least satirical and because this film is such an indelible piece of pop culture history it has been made fun of to death so its almost hard to see the seriousness in it. All of the above I mentioned could be a negative review or it could be reasons some people love it...like me. I was completely entranced by the twisted and disturbing plight of Tony Montana. Al Pacino is completely jaw dropping (more on that in a moment.) Gamers like myself who sunk thousands of hours into Grand Theft Auto 3 will find themselves reminiscing fondly by the music in the film. I only mention that because Scarface is very clearly the inspiration for every Grand Theft Auto video game (a series I hold near and dear above all others.) The setting of Miami makes for a vibrant, neon filled, 80's dream and only makes the violent turmoil all the more vivid. Honestly, for as shocking as I heard Scarface was I didn't think it was top of the pile for violence, language or nudity. There are absolutely some violent scenes, some of the most memorable and iconic I've ever seen but to put it as any sort of exploitation film would be pushing it.Would this film have been the same without Al Pacino? I honestly don't think so. He is Tony Montana. He brings him to life and uses every ounce of his incredible charisma to make a character that will forever be remembered. His rise from low level Cuban refugee to drug Kingpin is unforgettable. By the end of the film you literally feel disgust for him (which is the point) and he embodies the iconic film character. I already loved Pacino but to finally see him in one of his most revered roles was terrific. Steven Bauer is the ultimate sidekick. He is in nearly every scene with Pacino but unfortunately for him he gets buried by the performance of Pacino. Still he is there to support Tony and he does that. He is memorable, gives a subtle solid performance and is very good. Michelle Pfeiffer is okay. She is actually the weakest link in the film. Her character is very prissy and irritating and very stand offish. That is the point but it makes her hard to relate to or appreciate. Her chemistry with Pacino is average at best and she doesn't add much to the story. I actually didn't even realize she was in this and that's not surprising because she is forgettable. The supporting cast includes very good performances from Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Robert Loggia and F. Murray Abraham.I suppose it is worth giving kudos to director Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone (who wrote the film) that this was obviously an epic project for them. They fought with ratings boards and fought to keep the film exactly the way they wanted it. The problem is that it drags significantly once Tony ""gets made"" so to speak and his downfall in the last hour of the film. It almost feels like the film starts to fall apart a little bit towards the end or perhaps they were rushing to finish this epic story. Certainly Peter Jackson would have split this into three parts and rightfully so in some ways. It simply feels like more time is spent in the first two hours and then the last hour rushes into his infamous demise. The film is still captivating, a sweeping crime epic that others have constantly tried to live up to. It is a dark, very dark, twisted, disturbing dramatic bio-pic that I am so glad I finally saw. You can absolutely feel the intensity in each scene and you can just see all the elements that have made it a stone cold classic. The build up to finally seeing and hearing the iconic ""SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND"" was unbearable. I had never seen it in context and have seen it mocked time and time again...was I let down when I finally witnessed it? Nope. Epic conclusion to a truly classic film with minor flaws. 9.5/10",Scarface
46,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,A quintessential gangster movie,10,15 December 2008,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Since they're two of the most renowned actors of their time, I often think, as a serious movie buff, who I prefer. Al Pacino or Robert De Niro. Due to sheer scale of number of films I've seen, I usually tend to go with De Niro. But then I think, have I seen enough films from either actor to really make an informed decision? Nah, I've seen enough of De Niro's movies, but maybe not enough of Pacino's. Twenty five years after it first came out, I finally saw Pacino in one of his most revered roles, that of Cuban gangster Tony Montana, who cockily built up a massive cocaine empire in Miami in the very early 1980s, only for his greed and recklessness to blow it all.While the film itself is impressive enough, and Pacino's performance carries it wonderfully, it's definitely Montana the character who made the film so memorable for so long. Representing the dark side of the American dream, where anybody can be somebody doing anything, the frowned upon exile from Castro's Island, seen as rubbish heaped upon the States in exchange for some political agreement, with his cocksure, arrogant attitude epitomises the 80s ideals of greed and excess, much like his contemporaries Gordon Gekko from Wall Street and JR Ewing from Dallas. Allowed to grow obscenely rich from his ill gotten gains in the all-for-yourself era, his urge to make noise is apparent before big success happens, driving around in his cadillac with it's tacky, Del Boy style interior furnishings, right through to his giant in-door jacuzzi when he's made it big. Never afraid to show the darkness of the crime world, the film is at times brutally violent, with a brutal mid air hanging from a helicopter, through to an explosively violent finale where those he has crossed catch up with him in his tacky big house, ending up with one man with a giant automatic weapon taking on a whole army of machine gun toting lunatics. Brian De Palma reliably stamps his unmistakable style all over it, while the tone may feel a little too light at times, it's none-the-less an essential part of making the film what it is.An unforgettable film that's left a permanent mark on the crime movie genre, Scarface has lost none of it's power quarter of a century after it first came out. *****",Scarface
47,ElMaruecan82,The masterpiece that defines the 80's and the Gangster genre ...,10,3 May 2011,"Did you say ""overrated""? Really? Are you serious? You mean ""Scarface"": the movie with zero Oscar nominations, and a Razzie nomination for Brian De Palma as worst director, the movie which many pseudo cinematic purists constantly denounce the ""all flash and no substance""-ness, its new popularity among gangsters rappers, Al Pacino's over-the-top performance, a laughable script and so on and so forth... you mean THIS movie is overrated??? Sorry man, but if one thing, this movie is absolutely and criminally underrated! And its iconic status, its place in IMDb Top 250, and tenth position in the American Film Institute's Top Ten Gangster films, are only the kind of justices that cinematic Gods have owed this masterpiece for a long time.Yes, ""Scarface"" is a masterpiece, because it precisely didn't try to be one and the result is not unintentional either: the writing, the direction, the acting, everything points out a deliberate will to create an entertaining gangster flick. But I'm not sure Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma and Al Pacino expected this movie to become one of the most revered, quoted and of course, emblematic of the gangster genre, yet it did. Why? One word: guts, the kind of guts that break the walls and rhyme with balls. This movie had it. It's made of the same vein of classic pre-Godfather gangster flicks such as ""Little Caesar"", ""The Public Enemy"" and of course, the original ""Scarface : the Shame of a Nation"", Hawks' classic to which this film is dedicated. Scarface has the virile magnetism and rebellious detachment of these films mixed with the exuberant flamboyance of the 80's. Not kitsch, not dated, the film couldn't have had a better setting, it's all about posing and showing off richness and power, it's a success story made during a time were it was indeed glorified.This is the thought-provoking 'guts' of ""Scarface"" and why the film deserves its comparison with its more mature and respected predecessor: ""The Godfather"". ""Scarface"" is to the 80's what Coppola's film was to the 70's: a reference, if not a milestone. It brought something new, assuming a dazzling celebration of the gangster world appeal without the preachy morality of the 30's or any attempt of glamorization. Every single character is depicted as an unredeemable scumbag and that was before ""Goodfellas"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". They're not totally unlikable or amoral either, they're just victim of their own vision of succeeding the easy way.Because ""Scarface"" literally pushes a certain idea of the American Dream to its bloodiest limit, to taste freedom and capitalism until getting an indigestion, to live the drunkenness of power until an ultimate hangover  so what did you expect the movie to be: a romantic Shakespeare tragedy à la ""Godfather"" or a realistic epic drama à la ""Goodfellas""? No! The approach was right, it had to be a gripping fantasy about the Gangster world. It was naturally bashed by the critics, but at least, it could exorcise all the violence, and whatever was appealing in the lives of gangsters, with an acid but so flamboyant portrayal of the American Dream, before the same subject would be handled by a more tormented and cerebral Scorsese. Using a Scarfacian metaphor, the film is like a great sex with a painful orgasm.How dare you blame the portrayal of Tony Montana, for being over the top? The guy is a thug suffering from a Napoleon Syndrome?! All he got in Cuba was an experience of being beeped by communism, which all naturally, encouraged him to change the position in the only country that could allow that, a country neighboring his homeland enough to be the object of a cult with a view of freedom, money and prosperity so idealistic it twisted his morality. Tony wanted the American Dream in an excessive way, because that's all the way he viewed America, as a fantasy, It had to be a fantasy from the eyes of an emigrant, an emigrant who dreamed of driving beautiful cars, having his mansion with his initials graved in his chair and of course  getting the blonde.He wanted the world, and everything in it. He wanted money and power. And now you blame him for being over the top? Would you blame Norma Desmond to be too theatrical? Or Jack Torrance to be too weird? Tony Montana is a caricature only to those who can't see how caricatured the way the image of USA could be reflected, and to those blind people, De Palma even conceded that the movie's portrayal of Cubans wasn't reflecting blah blah, as if we needed to know that  come on, over the top? It's a movie and a damn entertaining one, whose ""over-the-top""-ness is the extra depth the haters fail to see .And the script, is probably one of the most memorable elements of the films. It drops so many F bombs, it's almost a punctuation mark creating delightful situations where we see Tony interacting with his sidekick, Steven Bauer as the unforgettable Manny, or his soon-to-be ex-boss, with his friends and enemies, until facing some anger management issues  Many people said it was Pacino's downfall, I think this was his rebirth, the new Pacino in his 40's, and his greatest role after Michael Corleone. The proof of Pacino's incredible talent is his ability to portray a range of gangster from Mafia boss to thug, in such a natural way, I'm sure he's an unsung icon to many criminals in the world. The script is just a verbal ode to the violence portrayed in this film, a violence that will leave red stains in your TV screen until it dirties your nice pajama  a violence reminding that for every fortune criminally earned, there is a Damocles sword upon your head waiting for a fatal mistake.So call it violent, over-the-top, dated, flashy  I say, ""Yes, man'g!"" and this is precisely why ""Scarface"" is a masterpiece !",Scarface
48,paul2001sw-1,Miami vice!,6,12 May 2021,"I tend to think of Brian dePalma as a rather derritivie director, but to give him due credit, his 'Scarface', a tale of an ambitious gangster who gets in above his depth and for whom everything ends badly amid trouble with the law, his rivals, the women in his life, and his cocaine addiction, precedes Scorcese's 'Goodfellas' by seven years. One thing you can't accuse him of is glamourising the criminal life: Tony Montana is always a nasty, jumped up vulgarian, his tasteless aesthetic outdoing even Donald Trump's (although watching the film now, it's not always clear to what extent his style is being mocked, and to what extent we are merely being shown how rich men generally aspired to live in the early 1980s). In fact, Montana is so unappealing that one limitation of the film is that it's near-impossible to empathise with him; another is de Palma's decidedly unsubtle direction. Al Pacino plays the lead with gusto but there's little humanity to bring out in the character. There's certainly a grand story here (as his enemies converge on his house at the end of the movie, with Tony inside in a state of increasing personal madness, I thought of 'Macbeth'), but it lacks the richness (and any deceptive hints of warmth) you can find in 'The Godfather', or in Scorcese's best work.",Scarface
49,MOscarbradley,This one outstays its welcome,6,2 June 2007,"Not so much a remake of the Hawks' great gangster film as a re-imagining with drugs taking over from booze and Tony now a Cuban immigrant, (it's set in Florida). Oliver Stone's script purports to give the film a deeper political dimension but it doesn't work. The whole Cuban thing seems like so much window-dressing. On the other hand, it looks fantastic; (Ferdinando Scarifiotti is credited as 'visual consultant'). De Palma uses colour and the wide-screen to give the film the look and feel of a pop-art cartoon and an the centre of this cartoon is a highly animated performance from Al Pacino in the title role, (he's feral where Muni was ape-like), but there's too much of him; he's never off the screen and he's acting all the time. The best performance comes from a young and untried Michelle Pfeiffer; she's street-wise and sexy and smart behind the eyes even when strung out on cocaine.The incestuous sister sub-plot isn't handled as explicitly here as it was in the original, (it's there, but it doesn't seem like a road either Stone or De Palma wants to go down). It's no disgrace and De Palma handles the violent set-pieces with aplomb but for all its sophistication it doesn't hold a candle to Hawk's original version and at almost three hours it goes on forever.",Scarface
50,bowmanblue,Pretty much perfect,9,3 September 2018,"Scarface' is just about as near as you can get to a perfect movie. It is also a remake. How many times have you heard those words put together?! I dare say not many. The original was made back in 1932 and I think it's fair to say that film-making techniques had progressed enough (along with the world around us!) to create an original and totally different spin on the story of an ambitious criminal slowly climbing the underworld's seedy ladder until he becomes the kingpin himself.You'll probably notice from any associated artwork for this film that it depicts Al Pacino, almost always on his own. That's because he plays the lead Tony 'Scarface' Montana - a South American immigrant who comes to Miami and sets about taking over the local drug trade. It's totally his film. Many say it's his equivalent of Robert DeNiro's 'Taxi Driver' as it would be almost nothing without him.It's also worth noting that he's possibly one of the most unlikable leads ever to grace the silver screen. He's a truly horrendous character with almost no redeemable traits - I suppose the only exceptions to his evil is that he only really hurts/kills those who are already involved in 'the business' or know what that sort of lifestyle is all about and he does his best not to hurt any innocent bystanders along the way. However, even his attempts to protect those he has some genuine feelings for (i.e. his family) often end up in disaster.I suppose it's worth mentioning about the protagonist's character as some may find it a little hard to watch a man like that for over two hours of screen time. If you're looking for a hero you can root for and even relate to then you probably won't find him here! I guess most view him like a human 'car crash' who you just can't help but watch in order to see how bad it (i.e. his life) can get. There are certainly some other familiar supporting cast-members, Michelle Pfeiffer being the most famous (or rather PRE-famous!), but, again, it's all Pacino's show. It really is a vehicle to show off his acting talent.
There's not an awful lot else to say about the film. If you're into your gritty crime/gangster films then you should probably own this one already. I suppose the only negative thing about it is its content. Due to its foul language, violence and drug abuse, it's probably not going to appeal to everyone (mainly those with a more 'sensitive' nature!), but it really is the pinnacle of cinematic gangster films made about a true anti-hero (of course 'Breaking Bad' later copied the idea - sort of - and made plenty of changes to create something completely different for the small screen, but the similarities are all there -keep an eye out for them!).",Scarface
51,g-bodyl,"Good, But Overrated!",7,4 November 2010,"Scarface is not a bad movie but compared to the gangster films from 1970-1995, it's only mediocre. Al Pacino, of course, was the best part of the movie. The premise is very interesting, at least enough for me to watch all three hours of the film. This movie has over-the-top violence but I respect that because these kind of movies feature violence all the time.This is about some Cuban guy who comes to America to gain power, wealth, drugs, and women. But he realizes all the power is not the best thing in the world.As I mentioned before, Pacino is the best part of the film. To make viewers aware, Tony Montana is very different than Michael Corelone. It was nice to see Michelle Pfeiffer.Overall, this is a good gangster movie but some scenes were tedious and over stretched. The best part of the film is the first half hour then things go downhill but not too bad. I rate this film 7/10.",Scarface

It's a pretty standard rise-to-power story that's excessive in everything it does. From the acting to the violence to the language to the drug use to the sound to the runtime, everything's over-the-top. I get that excess is the point, but it's just unpleasant to watch at times. Still, there are some impressive moments, and I think this film sticks the landing in the third act. I'm glad I finally got to say hello to Scarface, but I doubt I'll watch it again.",Scarface

55,nairtejas,Mob Mob Mob! ♦ 72%,5,7 November 2013,"Al Pacino is an extraordinary actor and with a role of Tony Montana, he sits on top of my lists. Scarface is a terribly long movie, but thank heavens, it is a gradual one.Talking about the journey of a Cuban immigrant, the plot revolved around his antics and his struggles. His undaunted attitude takes him above and then we know what happens. It's been published everywhere what greed does to a person; nothing new to munch on. But, there is more: the action, the guns, the dialogs. Oh, my the way the mob genre is taken care I am sure a fan of that. And coupled with good music, Scarface is a sure winner.But at a time, when we already have The Godfather trilogy & other similar films, Scarface just hangs in there. There are some memorable scenes in here and also the performances are quite good. But, unfortunately, the entertainment factor just didn't work out for me with this gimmick.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended for mob genre fans. For people who like short movies, this one is no-go. 7.2/10!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

He shoots people all over the place but when he's got to kill a man for Sosa he employs an elaborate plan with a car bomb. The finale is the definition of ""over the top."" Pacino seems to be doing a parody of a gangster, with the annoying Cuban accent (you keep expecting him to say, ""Luuucy, I'm home.""), the angry scowl, and the tough guy talk.

It is also a character study focusing on the maniacal Tony Montana played perfectly by the great Al Pacino. I recently saw Heat and I thought he was hamming it up there, but his performance is nothing compared to the sheer extravagance of Scarface. Set in a terrifically dated 80s Miami, Tony Montana starts off with a level of bravado that contributes both to his success and his downfall. Even at the beginning he is already too macho to function, and this just slides downhill through his paranoid outlook, criminal lifestyle and rampant drug use. Unlike other reviewers, I wouldn't say he is corrupted. Rather, his character is magnified to the point where it leads to his ultimate downfall, much to the chagrin of everyone else's lives he has ruined along the way. The action scenes along the way are very violent and memorable, if sensationalist. In these ways, the film doesn't differ much from other crime/gangster films but Al Pacino's performance is unique and deserves commendation.",Scarface

This will change many things in his personal life but also to his social status.I liked this movie very much because it had a simple but nice plot and it contained many great scenes that remained alive through the years. The direction which was made by Brian De Palma was very good and interesting, and he succeeded on making us understand the decisions, the feelings and the thoughts of his main characters. The interpretation of Al Pacino who played as Tony Montana was simply iconic. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Michelle Pfeiffer's who played as Elvira, F. Murray Abraham's who played as Omar and Steven Bauer's who played as Manny Ribera.

61,Dr_Coulardeau,Drug dealing is for schizophrenics,10,28 September 2009,"Don't let yourself be lured by the picture of the poor Cubans under the dictatorship of Fidel Castro who is kicking them out of the island. It is hinted these exiled people are far from being clean. They are the dregs of society and coming directly out of prison. Scarface is no exception. He is scum and scum he will remain till the end. The Americans are not lured at all, at least the police, but they are under strong pressure to provide these poor refugees with ""libertad"". As soon as Scarface gets that freedom he starts his business, from scratch and from the bottom, but he knows how to climb fast and how to get rid of obstacles and his road is punctuated with bodies or parts of bodies. In no time at all he is the boss and he is able to realize his ambition: millions from the opening Colombian route (cocaine of course) whereas those he eliminated to get in their place were only making a few grands. But the story of this man is the story of a paranoid and schizophrenic sociopath. He climbs to power and cannot see he has to share that power with newcomers. He defends his territory like a lion or a grizzly bear and his power becomes a war, a constant war in which everything and everyone is destroyed. That makes a perfect action film full of violence as if it were loaded with cocaine, but with a more human dimension in the character of Scarface himself who is impersonated marvelously by Al Pacino. The acting is so good that it transcends the pure bloody violence of the images and the plot. We can admire how Brian de Palma paints and composes his character to make him so true to what we can believe. He becomes a masterpiece in that psychological line in spite of the total absence of any other depth, social, cultural, political or whatever.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Scarface
62,eddie_baggins,A fierce and energetic movie unlike any other,10,9 June 2014,"Dripping in charisma, flooded with violence and profanity, filled with riotous drug use and centred around one of the most energy infused performances seen in cinematic history, Brian De Palma's Miami set 1983 gangster classic Scarface is a movie that sits on its black leathered throne high above all others before and all others since. Scarface is a movie that put its Oliver Stone penned middle finger up to those that shunned excess and made it it's cornerstone that has now seen it become not only a movie marvel but a member of pop culture that many movies only dream to be a part of.A remake of the 1932 Howard Hawkes directed film of the same name, De Palma's updated tale was upon release misunderstood by both audiences and critics alike. People knew not how to take a film that revelled in 3 hours of epic debauchery, murder, vanity and drugs and a main character that only ""trusts himself"" and only has his ""balls and his words, and he doesn't break either of them"". It's not hard to see why so many were put off by Al Pacino's frank and stunning turn as an immigrant who can think of nothing more than taking the world any way he can and taking no prisoners in doing so. It's interesting watching such a character at work in today's movie age in which all hero's and antiheroes must have a backbone as to why they do as they do, whereas Tony Montana just wants, he doesn't need a reason to own a tiger or rake in millions he just does it and enjoys doing so. It's a real testament to both the performance of Al Pacino and the script by Stone that this journey and man work the way they do as it would have been an easy feat for the movie to go off the rails without them at full strength which is the same as renowned director Brian De Palma.Instilling the Miami set film with a sense of life rarely seen on cinema screens, De Palma's Scarface is a film not only made by its subject and actors but a film that is transcended by its locale becoming a key component of the story it harbors. Miami lives and breathes under De Palma's steady hand (despite it being filmed elsewhere in the majority) and the sense of opportunity it presents to its migrated Cubans can be not only sensed by the audience but felt also. De Palma is a director well known for his erratic efforts behind the camera for every Untouchables there's a Femme Fatale and for every Blow Out there's a Raising Cain, but here the director is in charge at every angle, every performance feels right, every brutal act of gang violence strikes a blow and every synthesised beat of Giorgio Moroder's now classic score resonates. It's a film that works on all levels and De Palma is the king of its unique domain.Scarface is a movie that speaks for itself, it is what it is and that's why it has become the masterpiece many now see it as being. De Palma's film is a 3 epic that from the first frame to the last is utterly and undeniable excessive and for all the right reasons. From esteemed professionals through to street gangbangers, Scarface speaks to that wannabe crime lord in all of us and gives to us in the form of Tony Montana a protagonist that unlike most others is unashamed of who and what he is and a protagonist that makes this movie such a blast of fresh air even these 30 plus years on.5 flying flamingos out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Scarface
63,johnnyboyz,Live the American Dream With Tony Montana,9,14 February 2006,"Scarface has to be one of the best and one of the most well known 'mob' films you can find. Its 1980's feel and look, De Palma's directing and of course Pacino's wonderfully diverse accent twinned with his ruthless efficiency as both an actor and a character make it something special. The glossy Miami setting proves a wonderful backdrop for the protagonist's quest to achieve in life, and achieve he does. Although spoofed on a number of different occasions, nothing really gets taken away from this film as it, in a way, 'got there first'. It contains all the original, necessary atmosphere and 'mise-en-scene' required to really grab the viewer and suck them in with its slick and often loud character attire, exotic setting and eerie lighting in some scenes, announcing the violence to come before we even suspect anything.Apart from the rather erratic captions early on in the film, there is little you can find fault-wise in this film. If you like the genre and the sense of the narrative i.e.; it is rather lending itself towards dialogue more than action in a 60-40 balance and will have all the necessary scenes to draw out the 'climbing the ladder' scenario, then this film is definitely for you. The interesting accents and one-on-one conversations the central character has during the film with numerous friends and foe's alike adds to the sense of time being passed and rungs being climbed - it works very well.The mind spinning soundtrack full of 80's music is something you can't really decide whether to love or loath but thanks to a certain computer game from a few years ago, they seem to have regained a bit of respect amongst fans and it is certainly a breath of fresh air in the sense it's different when comparing it to standard music as a convention found in other mobster movies such as classical Italian themes in 'The Godfather Trilogy' and 1950's tracks being pumped out to mobsters in black suits when thinking of 'Goodfellas'.What also sells this film is the element of narrative once the character feels he's reached a certain stage in his goal. When he feels he's hit the top, the journey through Pacino's characters mind is equally as fascinating as the one we had when seeing him attempt to get there in the first place. The paranoia and obsession with security early on in his 'reign' is a hint of things to come and the bloody climax builds up through Pacino's good acting and a turn of events which helps us really begin to recognise with what a danger he has become through corruption of power.Despite its basic 'American Dream' plot, Scarface deals with it in some style and punch which is perhaps lacking in other films in the genre. Its nice iconography, mise-en-scene and decent acting from the cast puts it in a healthy position near the top of all time greats of the genre and possibly of all time.",Scarface
64,leplatypus,The aggressive side of snow white (DVD),4,2 January 2010,"At last, I saw it. This movie is one of the most talked of Paccino's movies but so far, it was just reviews for me. Now, I can understand why it remains a reference in the 80's movies.I was very surprised by its violence. Even for today, the bathroom scene is really vivid and all the subsequent killings are violent. Then, Paccino's character is unusual because he is totally driven (or nuts or stoned as you wish). He knows what he wants (liberty, power, money, woman) and he goes on even if it leads him to big troubles. At first, I was a bit shocked by all his macho attitude but under the skin, you can still find the good old Al. His scenes with Pfeiffer are great and he really know how to win a woman with his smile. It was also funny to see actually big names 20 years younger and I dare everyone to recognize ""young maid Marian"" as she really look like terribly different. I would conclude that this movie could really be viewed as a prequel for ""Carlito's Way'. I like the similar Hawaiian beach poster, but the latter is really a masterpiece because all the team have mastered their skills with the time.",Scarface
65,TheMovieDiorama,"Scarface lathers itself in memorable quotes, stylised violence and mountains of cocaine.",9,21 July 2018,"Brian De Palma remade the 1932 classic and exclaimed to Hollywood ""say hello to my little friend!"". Modernising it to colossal heights, thus creating one of the greatest gangster epics of all time. Relentlessly referenced in pop culture, my expectations were quite high. Suffice to say, they were met. We witness the irrepressible rise of Cuban refugee Tony Montana, as he enters the illegal drug business, and the eventual fall from decadence. The classic, to quote Drake, ""starting from the bottom now we're here"" narrative has consistently been a reliable structure. Enabling central character development whilst building an intimidating environment that allows for personality adaptation. The fictional Montana is a testament to this. Observing the manifestation of greed, lust and envy disguising the apparent loneliness and selfish behaviour of Montana. Money powers him, and De Palma's focus on the requirement of desiring the world makes him both ambitious and arrogant. Even when all can be achieved, his artificial greed beckons him to want more, consequently leading to his demise. A fascinating character study that was brought to life by the legend that is Pacino. Exaggerative, hyperactive, aggressive and commanding. Pacino embodied Montana and gave life to the drug kingpin. De Palma's lightning pace seamlessly combined frantic stylised action with punchy dialogue, whilst also introducing frequent long takes to spice up the Miami beach. Stone's screenplay is littered with memorability. ""Her womb is polluted"", ""you want to play games?"" and enough F-bombs to redefine the word profanity. Seriously, every other word! Plenty of exasperated action, particularly the mansion shootout, that excessively assist the visualisation of the crime world. My only criticism is with some of the song choices in the soundtrack, it comes off as trashy and I think Scarface is better than that. Despite the overlong runtime, this is 80s gangster mayhem and the sheer craziness from both Pacino and De Palma adds to the bloody charm.",Scarface

67,SAMTHEBESTEST,A nice ganster drama but i couldn't help the hatred I have for such content.,6,1 June 2020,"Scarface (1983) :
Brief Review -A nice ganster drama but i couldn't help the hatred I have for such content. Scarface is a same old story of an hopeless man who dreams to become a big thing even if it's from the wrong street. A cuban ex-concivt Tony arrives in Miami and begins to spread his arms over the drug cartel. He falls in love with his boss's lady and later gets her by killing his boss. Several conflicts leads him towards a disaster as he had to kill his best friend and find himself dead by the end. The writing is good and very well hooked if you really want to see this bad world and bad people. What i expect from a film is either entertainment or educating stuff or good people's story or good thoughts so that i can learn something in life or at least spend those 2 or 3 hours for something really good. What will i get by spending those 3 hours for a gangster's story? Why should i be interested in a bad guy's parallel and dead Universe. You see, that's the hatred i have for any film this genre. Well, Scarface still makes nice cinematic experience but surely has flaws. How come the drug dealer suddenly begins to care about kids when he's already doing no good to society by selling drugs. The character of Tony's wife is so useless in the film. Can somebody tell me of what use Elvira was to the script of Scarface? If there was no Elvira in the film what difference it would have made to the content of the film? Most of the gangster dramas has that typical dame factor for nothing, Scarface too doesn't beat it. Al Pacino as Tony is fine and so does the rest of the cast. Dialogues are brutal, abusive but it's no big surprise in this genre. De Palma has different world created for Scarface but the realism wasn't there. He neither goes too deep in the scenes not he has care for them especially the violent ones. Scarface somehow makes a Good gangster drama but i have some particular hatred for the bad guys so i couldn't help it. Besides it still has flaws and i have mentioned them already. If you still want to give it watch them it's okay but keep your expectations low.RATING - 6/10*By - #samthebestest",Scarface

69,insomniac_rod,Quality crude cinema. A vulgar display of power.,9,20 September 2009,"I regret for not watching this movie before. I mean, it's the perfect communion between violence and social criticism. I enjoy gangster movies when they feature smart plots, clever dialogs, and most of all, memorable performances.Believe me, this is the closest you will find when it comes about narcs and mobsters. The revenge, massacres, and negotiations in this movie happen in real life. ""Scarface"" is a violent criticism against government, society, and corruption in all aspects through memorable images.Al Pacino demonstrates he's the most talented actor of his generation and through his portray of Tony Montana he can make a lot of people feel communion with him.I mean, he is the perfect example of how people with no chances in life according to society may feel they got a chance in transcending economically through the easy way. That is through narcotics and mafia related issues. Tony had no education, didn't know how to behave or anything, but he was clever and knew the movement in streets. He was the typical example of an ignorant with extreme power, money, that could fix everything by killing and corrupting.His violent ways and sexual tendencies were combined negatively when he reached power. He couldn't handle himself and even demonstrated he didn't have regret for anything (like killing Manny). Also, his cocacine addiction was that heavy that it truly ruined his neurons and therefore his life.Brian de Palma creates a disturbing, violent world for his principal character who is the center of attention because of his unpredictable behavior and ambitions. But this world is filled with corrupted characters like Frank López.The world around Montana also has Steven Bauer playing Manny Ribera; who proved to be his right hand and most loyal friend (I'm straight but that man is truly attractive), Elvira Hancock played by the mythical beauty Michelle Pfeiffer at her best, and other mobsters and bodyguards such as Earnie.Beware, this movie is not for everyone; I mean, it has a dread feeling through it. It also becomes sad with the auto destructive situation of Tony and how he ends up ending his life in such a tragic manner.The movie contains memorable and relevant scenes in violence for cinema history such as the infamous and brutal chainsaw attack, Tony's demise, the massacre in the nightclub, plenty of shootings, and cocaine related situations.The ending blew me away and I was very nervous when ""that"" final assassin attacked Tony from behind. A classic in crime cinema and one of the most ""shocking"" commercial experiences.A movie not for anyone because it goes against the 80's brightness and more. It's crude cinema at his best qualities.",Scarface
70,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Only comparisons can explain the powerful ""Scarface""s lack of critical acclaim",9,9 January 2009,"Anyone who watches Brian De Palma's re-imagining of ""Scarface"" has to wonder why it didn't get so much as a nod for an Academy Award. A powerful performance by Al Pacino, several notable supporting roles and a story that's so eye-opening and fully developed are a few of the top reasons anyone watching this film today would call it great. So why nothing? Was it ahead of its time, or not far ahead enough? The only possible explanation is the latter. Though 9 years had passed since the last Godfather film, clearly Hollywood and its critics were not ready for something similar yet not as immaculate.Al Pacino is dynamite from start to finish as Tony Montana, a criminal immigrant from Cuba who works his way up the ladder of the cocaine business, becoming everything and losing it all. The story is the classic rise and fall of a nobody, of a man with nothing but an iron conviction, even if his values aren't the same as our own. Pacino nails the strong-willed no- fear attitude of Montana, but is equally as commanding when Montana borders on the insane and the emotional. He simply has a magnetism about him as an actor and that's something you have or you don't. Pacino flaunts it in this film and without him it wouldn't have been nearly as powerful.You simply can't compare Montana to Michael Corleone of ""The Godfather""--Pacino helms both roles excellently, but they're different characters who handle power in different ways. As for the rest of the film, to compare it to ""The Godfather"" is unfair. Not only is it unfair to compare any film to something as masterful as the 1972 classic, but they're not even about the same thing: one the Mafia, the other Miami drug cartels. Yes, both involve ordering hits and bloody ones at that, but it's a whole other story. Oliver Stone writes a great script full of memorable scenes and lines that are no less unforgettable than ""The Godfather."" The only places where ""Scarface"" can't measure up--and reasonably so--are in cinematography, art direction and directing. Brian DePalma does good stuff, and he should be praised for his work on the film, but it's not a stainless piece of film-making. Simply put, if you feel forced to compare, which perhaps critics in the early 80s did, ""Scarface"" can't hold a candle to ""The Godfather,"" but there are a number of reasons it should not have been harshly judged.In supporting roles, Motana's best friend Tony played by Steven Bauer is a refreshingly nice, likable, character; Robert Loggia as the big drug guy Frank Lopez also commands attention in contrast to Pacino's character; Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, given the difficult roller coaster ride part of Montana's little sister excels in her role, and even Michelle Pfeiffer, as stoic and loathsome as her love interest character is, has some moments. All in all this is a good ensemble--Pacino doesn't run the show as much as he steals the scenes.When viewed independently from similar material, the only really noticeable weaknesses of ""Scarface"" are it's poor soundtrack choices and miserable electronic score when something orchestral would have brought out the best in this film. Whoever made the decision at the top to let the film be scored like that really shot a hole in the film that while small, was in a bad place.""Scarface"" is a great film that through its violence, swearing and general depiction of an extravagant but depressingly hollow and terrible lifestyle, manages to tell the story of the hunger and abuse of power in this country through one man in a complete and thorough way. There are no gaps in this storytelling and the script is full of lines that as sick, twisted and inherently flawed as Montana is, make him a compelling figure with considerably interesting things to say.",Scarface

Now it is judged as such by critics also. Why was it slashed when it was released? I presume because of the gore. ""Scarface"" is one of the most raw gangster films ever made. For that period of time it was considered to be a shocking portrayal of violence in bad taste. Even to this day, it still has got big brazen balls, with especially one horrific scene where a guy gets tortured with a chainsaw. This movie got a bad name for its violence, but by todays standards it is considered mainstream. Suited for 16 years and older. And if you skip the ""chainsaw"" scene, 12 years and older.Note the terrible eighties music. It was bad then, it is still bad now. But that bad soundtrack is featured in such a great classic that the terrible poppy tunes dont irritate too much. It has even gained some cult status! And by the way, those were truly the disco sounds of that era in which the Cuban crime wave hit America.",Scarface
73,Vartiainen,Al Pacino is the man,8,7 February 2018,"In many ways Scarface, a remake of a 1932 film of the same name, is the next logical step from movies such as The Godfather trilogy, Once Upon a Time in America and Goodfellas. All those gangster films take place in the early decades of the 20th century and heavily feature mafia or at least gangs closely associated with them. Whereas Scarface takes place in Florida in the 1980s and features Cuban and South American drug lords. Where the crime in those first mentioned films can be seen as civilized, code-bound and even somewhat admirable, Scarface lifts away the thin veneer of civility and throws us straight to the wolves.Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is a Cuban refugee working to rise to the top of the Florida drug business. His rough, uneducated manners constantly clash with those around him, but no one can claim he doesn't get results. But despite all his success he is a man deeply immersed in vice and eventually those start to consume his every waking hour.Scarface has been called cheesy. It's been called excessive, brutal and gory. It's been called clichéd. And it's all those things, but what these critics fail to realize is the fact that it's meant to be all those. As I said, it's the next step. A gangster film where the main character doesn't hide the fact he's a completely irredeemable monster poorly disguising himself as a human being. And yet in Pacino's amazing hands even a character such as this one can have charisma, can pull us in. We still don't like him, but we can grudgingly respect his success.It's an ugly film. It's also charismatic, brutal, beautifully shot and well-acted. It features some truly memorable song tracks and has influenced an entire generation of film makers. Whether you like it or not, you cannot deny it its place in our cultural consciousness.",Scarface

They come to Miami and get into the drug business where they meet and work for wealthy cocaine dealer, Frank Lopez (Loggia). Soon, Tony meets Frank's mistress, Elvira Hancock (Pfeiffer) and falls for her.

One of them was the 1932 drama entitled 'scarface' with Paul Muni. I enjoyed it so much, I saw it twenty-two times. It was incredible. However, went I visited the theater to see this updated version, also called ""Scarface"" this time with Al Pacino, I was astonished and completely stunned by this remake. I should not have been surprised at it's electrifying performances because Brian De Palma stacked it with star power. In this explosive story we are given a young and utterly ruthless Cuban immigrant named Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who aims for the top of the drug world and will destroy anyone who stands in his way. To help him in his rise for power is his close friend and partner named Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer), who should have remembered, if you side with the devil, you will get burned. Others who join Tony's meteoric rise to power are Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham, associates who feed Tony's appetite for power, begin as friends then become obstacles. Tony Montana shares many stock features with dictators. He is bold, daring and most of all fearless. Unfortunately, like all maniacal men of power he forgets the most important quality necessary to remain in power, vigilance. This is something he fails to maintain as he also tragically discovers, his love for his sister, may not be platonic.

Al Pacino playing Tony Montana who is supposed to be Al Capone only now he's Cuban instead of Italian and he does coke instead of booze and he's an immigrant instead of a New Yorker and he's in Florida instead of Chicago and dies instead of going to jail on tax evasion.I can see how it all works for an update, but ""The Untouchables"" didn't need an update to be good. In fact it was a better movie.Because, really, when you break down the movie to what it really is, the only thing, the only word that comes to mind is ""boring."" It is long and dull and this is despite the face that under most circumstances both Pacino and De Palma are generally the furthest thing from dull.Ultimately, it needs to be streamlined. As it is, it is one long elaboration and a shoot out at the end with only a couple really developed characters.All involved could do better.",Scarface
79,strong-122-478885,Al Pacino Stinks,1,16 May 2018,"No conflict here. I hate this movie.Al Pacino's Tony Montana was terrible. Pacino is a grossly over-rated actor whose career has gone on for far too long now. He really should have stuck to playing such roles as a gay-wannabe like he did in Cruising. Yeah. That's the only sort of part that I think Pacino is most suitable for.For nearly 3 hours (!) this stupid movie did nothing but bask and wallow in a gross excess and unpleasantness and then, in the end, offered no new insights, except that (get this!) ""crime doesn't pay"" (which isn't any sort of new news at all).If you honestly want to see an excellent production of Scarface (and some superb acting, as well), then check out the original version, starring Paul Muni, from 1932. It puts everything about this inferior, up-dated film to absolute shame.",Scarface
80,dfranzen70,"Some rise, some fall, some climb...",6,11 July 2019,"Certainly, how much you enjoy this movie will depend mostly on how much you enjoy Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana. If you find Tony to be a bit too over the top, perhaps a caricature of 80s bad guy, then you're likely to find Scarface to be a one-dimensional, overblown piece of fluff. But if you think Tony is a major badass whose overreactions help enhance his character, not detract from it, then Scarface is your movie. The movie is still very quotable, even 36 years later! And it's educational. Never sample your own product. Good life lesson right there, kids. Anyway, I fall into the second group. Yeah, it's outlandish theater, but it somehow works - particularly as it's set in the overwhelming 1980s. Of course, fresh-off-the-boat Tony is a cocky bastard, even with the immigration guys. Of course, he blusters his way into a coke deal, which quickly goes south. Of course, he fights his way to the top of the crime game. He's all cojones; just ask him. Couple of other notes - the entire cast is a lot of fun, from Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio (playing his kid sister) and Michelle Pfeiffer (playing his wife) to Robert Loggia (his boss) and F. Murray Abraham (boss' right-hand man). Steven Bauer, playing Tony's own right-hand man, is okay, but am I the only one who sees a resemblance to Michael Ian Black? I will say that Tony's act of bulldozing over everyone and disregarding all help got a bit tiresome, but that's in keeping with his character, anyway. For me, this version of Scarface is good but not a huge classic - just a good representation of the decadent 80s from Brian DePalma. Almost a time capsule of same, really.",Scarface
81,PWNYCNY,Chilling movie,9,3 November 2006,"In 1983 I found this movie to be flawed but entertaining in a campy sort of way. Here was Al Pacino playing a Cuban gangster, along with a whole bunch of other non-Hispanic actors playing various Latin American characters. To me it added to the essential surrealist quality of the movie. Well, 23 years later, I watched the same movie and my impressions have changed. This movie is anything but surrealistic. This movie is a powerful dramatization of what happens when a psychopath grabs power. This is Al Pacino's greatest movie. Here he plays a character who is angry, alienated, dispossessed, morally depraved and marginalized. His own mother wants nothing to do with him. His own sister is utterly corrupted by his presence. Unlike Michael in The Godfather, whose own depravity is at least blunted by the veneer of middle class civility, Tony's behavior is upfront, unambiguous, without restraint and utterly lacking in finesse. Everything he does is based on cunning and brute force. Unlike the Godfather, Tony doesn't need an organization to run his operation, he IS the organization. Nor does he pretend to be anything other than what he is, a gangster. For Tony is a product of the culture of violence that pervades society, produces characters like Tony Montana and supplies Hollywood with the material with which to make these kind of chilling movies.Further comments: the story is tragic. Tony is doomed from the start. He wants it all but doesn't have the education or temperament to channel his efforts in a way so as to avoid self-destruction. He is like a locomotive building speed and unable to stop because he doesn't have brakes. Now, Tony is not bad person; he is a product of a materialistic culture that measures success in terms of money. For Tony the equation is simple: money equals power which in turn equals self worth. Tony has the potential to do great things, but having been brutalized has warped his character, and so for him money is toxic - the more he accumulates the more paranoid he becomes. That's too bad because all that potential goes to waste, with tragic consequences.",Scarface

This is probably my favorite gangster movie with the underrated ""Hoodlum"" being my first.  Al Pacino should have gotten an Oscar nomination for his awesome performance as Tony Montana.  His portrayal is that of a person who simply wants to succeed in his life and escape his horrid past under communism.  The only problem with that is that he's going about all the wrong ways of doing it.  Viewers should also be warned about the excessive violence in this movie.  I mean the famous chainsaw scene certainly is something.  Brian De Palma really should have gotten an Oscar for Best Director for direction in this movie is slick.  I would also like to point out that a lot of gangster rappers love this movie.  Most notably rapper Scarface.   This movie also has some of the best quotes in movie history like:Tony Montana -""say hello to lil' friend!""Tony Montana -""this country is just like a giant p***y, it's just waiting to get f****d.""The ""f"" word is used quite a lot to.  10/10",Scarface
83,MaxBorg89,Say hello to Al Pacino!,10,2 March 2006,"Brian De Palma is one of the most talented directors around, even if he hasn't done a really great film since Carlito's Way (Mission:Impossible was good, but not exactly the flawless thriller you'd expect from the man who gave us Blow Out, Body Double and other fine Hitchcock homages). Until a week ago, I thought that if I had to choose only one De Palma movie to watch for the rest of my life, it would be The Untouchables. Then I saw Scarface, and everything changed.Like The Godfather, Goodfellas and Casino (whose tag-line, ""No one stays at the top forever."", is perfect for this film as well), Scarface showcases a criminal's slow rise to absolute power, and the events which will lead to his inevitable downfall. It's a painful, very gory journey (it's not as bloody as Carrie, also by De Palma, but quite close), and the problem is, the audience likes it. But then, who wouldn't want to get the most by doing the least? If it wasn't for the carnage that derives, it wouldn't be such a bad idea. That's the best thing with these movies: they show you how cool it could be to live like a gangster, before shocking you with the downside of the whole story.But Scarface's greatness isn't all due to De Palma's direction. No, we have two other people to thank too: one is Oliver Stone, who wrote the eternally quotable dialogue (""You know what capitalism is? Getting f**ked!"";""You wanna play games? Okay. You wanna play rough? Okay. Say hello to my little friend!""). But it's Al Pacino's Tony Montana who made this film an instant classic. The crook who just wants to make things better for himself and his family and turns into the Cuban equivalent of Michael Corleone (another essential Pacino role) is the best work he's ever done, not to mention his own favorite of all the characters he has played, and while I was watching him, a thought started circling in my head, the same thought that showed up when I saw Reese Witherspoon in Election and Uma Thurman in Kill Bill: where the hell is his Best Actor Oscar? The fact that he didn't even receive a nomination, just like the aforementioned actresses, is one of the worst crimes in cinema history.Still, that inexplicable omission by the Academy doesn't prevent Scarface from being one of the greatest movies of all time. If you like gangster movies, this seminal '80s flick has to be seen.",Scarface
84,estebangonzalez10,Say hello to my little friend!!!,9,29 August 2013,"""I always tell the truth. Even when I lie.""Brian DePalma's Scarface has become such a classic film over time and its main character (Al Pacino as Scarface) is such an iconic pop cultural figure that few people would believe that he was actually nominated for a Razzie for Worst Director in 1984. Scarface is yet another film that was perhaps misunderstood when it came out, but has built a solid cult following over time (it influenced a lot of rappers and hip hop artists during the 90's) and is recognized by the IMDb as one of the top 250 films. When it comes to gangster films this might not be as perfect as The Godfather I, II, or Goodfellas but it still ranks among the top 10 in the genre and it has become more popular over time. Despite having never seen the film in its entirety before, I was familiar with the ending. Everyone knows where the phrase ""Say hello to my little friend"" comes from despite never have seeing this film because the ending of Scarface is perhaps one of the best known scenes in cinema history. Scarface has so many memorable quotes that it's hard to choose one, and that is thanks to the great script written by Oliver Stone who loosely adapted it from a prior film. It is also such a memorable film thanks in most part to Al Pacino's masterful performance as Tony Montana. He has made so many great films in his career, but I think this character will always stand out a bit above the rest. For some critics his performance may be over the top, but I think he nailed it and that is why Montana has become such an iconic figure over time. There is something about him that has transcended time and cultures. It is an epic and ultra violent stylized film and that is why Al Pacino's over the top and loud performance worked so well. Scarface is about 170 minutes long but it never ceases to entertain for a second.During the Mariel harbor opening in Cuba more than 100,000 Cuban refugees were sent to the United States, one of those refugees happened to be communist hating ex military Tony Montana (Al Pacino). He has big dreams and high ambitions but upon his arrival he has to start off low. He and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer) begin washing dishes when they are contacted by Omar Suarez (Murray Abraham) to make a business deal with some dangerous Colombians involving some drugs and money. Tony and Manny survive their mission and Omar introduces them to his boss, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia), a drug kingpin in Miami, who hires their services. Frank has it all: a big mansion, nice cars, and a beautiful wife named Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer); everything that Tony dreams of having in this new country. Tony is convinced that he will not stop until he gets what he wants and in doing so helping his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) with whom he had been separated during his prison stint in Cuba. The only problem is that he will have to make a lot of enemies on the way to the top.I really don't know what DePalma's true intentions were for Scarface. I don't believe he was trying to glorify Scarface because he was portrayed in a dark and negative light, but over time he has become sort of a role model for some people. Perhaps Al Pacino's performance was so strong that it made it easy for audience's to relate to this ambitious character. DePalma was able to make the audience care for this unstable and explosive character. On the one hand he refused to kill women and kids, but on the other he was able to kill his best friend without hesitation. Scarface does seem to walk a fine line between glorifying the character and showing how destructive ambition and excesses can be. This bleak mood set in the film can be seen through Pfeiffer's character, someone who has it all but seems completely unhappy with life. Even Tony himself once he achieves his goals seems to lose himself completely by these excesses. He hates seeing his sister with other men involved in the same business because he knows how ugly this life is. That is why I think DePalma was never trying to portray Scarface in a glorifying light, but over time his character has become admired by worldwide audiences. The film has a lot to say about ambition, loyalty, and betrayal, but above all it is a stylized ultra violent film that lacks the technical achievements that The Godfather had. It still remains as one of the great gangster and immigrant films of the 80's.",Scarface

90,drystyx,helped begin the decline of gangster movies,1,26 December 2006,"Before ""Godfather"", cops and robbers movies were exciting and entertaining. Then came the long boring gangster movies which tried to make us understand gangsters. It doesn't work. ""Scarface"" suffers from lack of likable characters, lack of believable characters, lack of plot, lack of motivation, lack of a logical sequence of events, lack of fun, just a lack of everything. It is not an exciting movie. You fall asleep before you hear the action wake you up, and then you don't really care. Pacino seems only capable of portraying a pretty boy, even with a scarface, he tries to stay pretty in each scene. Its not totally his fault. The writing is pitiful. Pacino's character comes from a multitude of beautiful Latino women, and we are to believe he lusts after some middle aged looking, raggedy looking, rather pitiful looking, pale lifeless ordinary blonde? Clearly a woman wrote this part of the script. No man could ever buy into it. The plot fails, too. Pacino magically becomes a top master criminal because....well, no one knows why. Nothing is explained. Nothing makes sense. But then, the modern gangsster films are all that way. We don't understand the characters, partly because we have no idea what's going on. Just a bunch of lines, mean looks and blood and gore we actually sleep through.",Scarface
91,slokes,Tony The Blow-Man,4,16 January 2005,"""Scarface"" is a useful movie to have around. If you walk into someone's house for the first time, and he quotes ""Scarface"" twice in the first 15 minutes, you know it's time to leave.After escaping his native Cuba during 1980's Mariel boatlift, former jailbird Tony Montana (Al Pacino) gets a second life in the land of opportunity, which he takes full advantage of as one of Miami's leading cocaine cowboys. Tony wants it all, including his boss's wife, his sister's devotion, and a mountain of blow to call his own, but once he gets it, he starts on a downhill trajectory with fatal consequences.The fact so many people like ""Scarface"" is testament to the intensity of Pacino's performance more than the intelligence behind it. In the DVD documentary, Pacino readily admits to the character being two-dimensional. For some, that's great. He's not too complicated that way. But for me, Tony Montana is worth maybe 20 minutes in a movie about someone else. He blows too hot.Pacino isn't great here. He has some good scenes like at the beginning when he's being questioned by some cops, but mostly he just yells a lot. The supporting performances are uniformly weak, including F. Murray Abraham, who gave one of the great screen performances in the following year's ""Amadeus."" Michelle Pfeiffer does the best work for 10 minutes, but then the script seems to lose interest in her character and she ends up throwing out some random histrionics before exiting stage left.The storyline is simplistic and uninvolving. The score is one of the lamest, especially during the opening sequence showing news footage from the Mariel boatlift. The motivations of everyone from Tony's early benefactor Frank Lopez to Hector the Colombian are at best opaque and at worst cry plot convenience. There's a silly bit of business involving Tony's sister and mother which is dragged out too long. And with Pacino's central character so unlikable, this is all too much to deal with.Is it director Brian De Palma? De Palma makes interesting movies, just not always good ones. He made some very good movies around the early '80s, and ""Scarface"" would seem like a prime candidate to be another. But it's like when he has a great actor to work with, like Pacino or Sean Penn in ""Casualties Of War,"" he loses the ability to rein them in and just lets them bolt through the fences. At the same time, De Palma often gets great performances from less-heralded actors, like John Travolta in ""Blow Out,"" Craig Wasson in ""Body Double,"" and Michael J. Fox in ""Casualties Of War."" He's not untalented, just maddening inconsistent.The film does have passion, and some momentum and excitement that carries into the final crescendo. There's a terrific sequence involving Montana and an assassination target that generates some real concern with the audience because you are actually meant to care a little about the people involved, and Tony for once is not acting according to type.But mostly ""Scarface"" is an '80s TV movie with marathon swearing and bloodletting, and a performance from Pacino that hopefully got it out of his system for a while. It's cathartic, maybe, but so's running someone off the road after they cut you off. Not exactly reasonable therapy.",Scarface

Uneducated with a history both in the army and in prison his prospects of a bright future in his new country is small. However, he has something going for himself, he has guts. Or as he says himself, he has balls, which is the most important ability in the world. He gets in with the drug dealers quickly working his way up through the hierarchy, often by doing the violent and dirty work. Soon he finds himself in a position to challenge for overall control of the market. But ambition and nerves of steel isn't always a good thing...Comments: A very violent film, almost seeming unrefined, but in a refreshing way. It seems true, it seems plausible and is very captivating. It is very long, almost three hours, but good a story and good acting makes sure it is never dull. There is always something happening, it simply takes long time to properly tell this story. Any shorter and pieces would probably start to fall apart.Yes it is very violent, and very raw about the action scenes. Some are quite gruesome. But this is almost a must, a reflection on Scarface's character. He is very raw, he is very violent. For him to be verbally very provocative and not follow it with action would make him feel false. For him to be credible as a violent gangster that works himself up quickly due to the violent deeds he does, earning him respect (and fear) in his environment.On the other hand, there is no unnecessary violence. There is no action or blood for the sake of being violence, or to have a shoot-out. The violence is no thrill to excite the audience. Every scene is an integral part of the story, important to paint the entire picture of Tony Montana.I also liked the attention to detail. Especially some small parts of the story, barely noticeable, to make it feel very plausible. For example look for when Tony cocks his gun in his fight with Frank. Not until Frank unknowingly has confirmed Tony's suspicion.Al Pacino does great work acting this character. Very emotional, very raw, it must have been hard not to go over the top with a character like that. I think he never does, not really anyway. Sure, he got good support from other characters and the story, but his acting is very impressive here. On the other side of the scale, but equally impressing is Michelle Pfeiffer as the stoned trophy wife that almost never shows any emotion. To only act with words. An early role, and pretty small, role for her, but impressive.All in all a very solid movie, especially if you like gangster movies. Many minutes, but not long. I can understand why this has become a classic.8/10",Scarface

By the end of the movie, he is sitting behind a desk, in a very expensive suit in a very expensive house. The product of his wealth: Drug money. In two and a half hours, Brian de Palma tells us how he gets from A to Z, but maybe not as well as the majority of viewers say.DePalma gets from A- to about M (for Montana) in competent fashion. Scarface ranges from very charming to very brutal and gives Al Pachino a chance to shine. So what goes wrong. The last third of Scarface feels like a different movie, an overwrought hack job. I'm not sure who is to blame, Pachino for his painfully overdone performance or DePalma for letting him get away with it. Or maybe it's Oliver Stone's fault for all the poorly scripted lines and developments which get worse and worse up until the end. At any rate, Scarface comes apart in spectacular fashion, leaving a movie that is medium good (at best) watch it and decide for yourself",Scarface

97,Movie-ManDan,Say Hello To My Little Friend!!!!!,10,21 November 2014,"Godfather, Scarface and Goodfellas are the greatest mob movies ever made. The best is The Godfather, hands down. The second best is this--Scarface--a violent depiction of a Cuban refugee's rise to the top of the crime underworld. Al Pacino is at his most insane as protagonist, Tony Montana, a ruthless criminal from Cuba who makes his way to Miami is the Spring of 1980 with his best friend, Manny (Steven Bauer). As they get to know exactly what it is like in the Mafia, Tony explodes with fury and becomes the top mobster in the world. As Tony is riding high, his paranoia, greed and brutal actions make him a sought after target he can't escape. When Scarface in 1932 was released, it was a major controversy and was released a year late due to its extreme violence. Over 50 years later, similar things occur, with things almost being banned and nearly getting an X rating. This day in age, Scarface really isn't bad. Kids these days are exposed to profanity, sex, drugs and violence everywhere they go. Scarface is a very violent film, but other action directors such as John Woo and Ringo Lam have made more violent movies than this. But what is good about the violence, not like I'm trying to make light on it, is how well choreographed and artful it is. DePalma is at his best here. And the acting...where was Pacino's Oscar? After a few years without a great flick, Pacino storms back, only to have another robbery. His accent is dynamic, this style is genius, his character is ruthless and evil, and that's so good. His determination to get to the top and protect everything he has is kind of inspirational: a nobody rises to the top of the world. Every rapper's house is not complete without Scarface. Every movie lover's house isn't complete without Scarface either.",Scarface

99,PredragReviews,"""The World Is Yours""",10,14 June 2016,"""Scarface"" is one of the greatest of all mob movies. It's an epic crime drama done with style and care. Brian De Palma presents a film that ignites the screen with a great screenplay by Oliver Stone and an amazing performance by Al Pacino. For those unfamiliar with the story, Scarface follows the path of Tony Montana, a charismatic Cuban refugee, who arrives in Miami looking for the American dream. Tony's up-front and tough personality makes him go right to the top of the cocaine underworld. However, no one, as they say, stays at the top forever. There are consequences to his success, and as Tony learns, money and power can't give you everything. A special mention should go to Michelle Pfeiffer, who superbly plays Tony's love, in what was her first major film role. This film is not for the faint at heart as directer Brian De Palma 3 times had the film rejected because it had and X-Rated certificate. He literally had to take the people who give the certificates out to court. Although grotesquely brutal this movie could teach kids good lessons that crime does not pay as when he gets to the top of the underworld his life corrupts through cocaine and he ends up killing the ones he loves and watching ones he loves die in crossfire.The film is famous for it's scenes of violence, including a victim chained to a shower and killed with a chainsaw. Director Brian DePalma, not really known for excess gloriously lavishes in it here and films his movie with style and gusto, ""Scarface"" is unique because it feels like it was made with real respect for the material. Consider that you have one of Hollywood's future greatest directors writing the script and one of American film's most stylish talents directing and on top of that, an iconic actor in the lead role. Even the moody main theme is composed by none other than Giorgio Moroder. The ending is especially deliciously bloody, as if a normal shoot-out is for sissies. ""Scarface"" remains a potent movie because it has themes we can all relate to, we all want wealth, power and at least one beautiful woman, ""Scarface"" asks the question of what extremes would one go to to achieve wealth, and is it worth anything when it is dirty money? Overall rating: 10 out of 10.",Scarface
100,gangstahippie,One Of The Greatest Films Of The 80's.,10,13 August 2006,"Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence and Language,Drug Use and Brief Nudity.I bought Scarface and Reservoir Dogs on DVD at HMV a couple of weeks ago.Scarface is a film that is very famous.A lot of people seem to know about it.At my high school a lot of people seem to wear Scarface T-shirts and other memoribilia.Scarface is big in the rap/hip-hop culture.Most people think that you have to be a rap music fan to like Scarface but that is definitely not true.I like rap but its not my favorite genre of music.Scarface is my third favorite film of all time.This film is simply excellent.I have seen it twice on DVD.This film is almost perfect.The acting especially that of Al Pacino is excellent.Pacino is Italian in reality but in this film he is a very convincing cuban drug dealer.The acting of Michelle Pheifer and Steven Bauer are very good as well.I'm really surprised this film was not nominated for any Oscars.I think its the best picture of 1983.Al Pacino was nominated for an acting Golden Globe but not for an academy award.Pacino is an excellent actor.We have seen him act well in plenty of films such as The Godfather Parts 1,2 and 3,Dog Day Afternoon,And Justice For All etc.Scarface is no exception.Pacino's acting is great!While tame by today's standards Scarface was considered really violent when it was released in 1983.It was slapped with an X-rating originally.Another reason Scarface is a great movie is because of the excellent storyline.The film is about a poor cuban immigrant named Tony Montana.As he finds criminal jobs like selling Cocaine and Murdering people he gets more money and becomes rich.However he becomes a cocaine addict and his kid-sister Gina who Tony did not want to turn out bad has become almost like he has.One of the best parts about the film is the big shootout in the end where *SPOILER* Tony Dies *END OF SPOILER*.In Conclusion if you have not seen the film Scarface yet I suggest going to your local video store and buying the film.You wont regret it.Runtime:170min 10/10",Scarface
101,brando647,A Drug-Fueled Epic on Greed/Excess,8,28 August 2012,"It's almost pointless to comment on a classic movie like SCARFACE because it's one of those movies that just about everyone's already seen and formed an opinion on. And based on the cult status the movie has achieved, popular in rap music with loads of movie merchandise overflowing on the shelves at your local Spencer's, its love is pretty universal. Brian De Palma's classic is the ultimate depiction of the 80's cocaine scene. At nearly three hours long, it's an epic about the rise to power of one man through the ranks of the international drug trade. Based on the 1932 movie of the same name (and the novel from Armitage Trail), it follows Cuban immigrant Tony Montana as he arrives in Miami in 1980 as one of the Cuban prisoners lumped into the mass emigration to get rid of his countries worst offenders. He arrives in the States with nothing but wastes no time in attracting the attention of the crime world when he assassinates a political prisoner in exchange for his green card. From there, he uses his brutal nature and honorable business ethic to climb to the top of Miami's cocaine trade, stomping out anyone who makes the mistake of crossing him. Still SCARFACE is, if anything, a morality tale where money and power lead to paranoia and eventually a tragic end. SCARFACE is iconic and has left it's impression on just about every aspect of our culture, from music to the video game industry (pretty obvious if you've ever played ""Grand Theft Auto: Vice City"".Yeah, I'm one of the millions that consider this an awesome movie. And it's no surprise why it's become so popular: it's the ultimate underdog story. Montana begins the movie with nothing but his ambitions. He follows his own code of ethics, believing in honest business dealings but unafraid of resorting to violence when he needs to set an example. He sets his sights on his employer's beautiful wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), regardless of the risk. And with nothing but his ""balls and his word"", he accomplishes everything he sets out to do. You can't help but cheer him on because Al Pacino as Montana is just so freakin' charismatic from the very start when we meet him during an interrogation with Federal Customs agents. It's no wonder what everyone wants to be Tony Montana, despite the fact that he'syou knowa drug dealer. The movie has gotten some heat for it's supposed glorification of violence and cocaine, but it's really nothing of the sort. Sure, Montana is a violent man and engages in some pretty horrible dealings but, the fact of the matter is, he pays for it all in the end. The movie doesn't leave you with fuzzy feelings and delusions of the easy life. It's a warning about how bad business leads to bad times. Montana gets what he deserves by the end of the movie, in probably the best final standoff ever put to film.No offense to more hardcore Pacino fans, but this is his best role in my opinion. He's suave, charming, and dangerous. You can't go far without seeing Montana's face plastered on something; even I used to have a SCARFACE cigarette case with the trademark black and white poster image. Michelle Pfeiffer is gorgeous as Elvira, the drugged-out woman of Montana's dreams. Beautiful on the outside, dead on the inside; Elvira acts as a spoil to Montana's ambitions. She reminds him that he's nothing more than a trigger-happy villain who deals in drugsa man so obsessed with his money and business that nothing else matters. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is Montana's younger sister Gina, a naïve woman who's begun dabbling in the dark side of Miami's scene. There's an almost incestuous undertone to the way Montana acts over-protective of his sister, going into a frenzy at the mere thought that another man has his hands on her. The movie also boasts great performances from Steven Bauer, F. Murray Abraham, Robert Loggia, and Paul Shenar. There's a lot of talent in this movie, and some incredible production value to boot. It doesn't hurt that this movie was shot in the early '80s and perfectly able to capture the bright neon veneer of the cocaine decade. The '80s are universally accepted as the decade of excess, and this movie is all about the excess. The style, the violence, the ""yeyo"", the killer montageSCARFACE is certainly epic.",Scarface

105,DeeNine-2,Compelling,8,5 November 2003,"I missed this intentionally when it came out in 1983 believing it to be another version of the Al Capone story. Of course Al Pacino would be brilliant as Al Capone and demand every square inch of the screen and get it. And he was and he did. And director Brian DePalma would spray the screen in scarlet, and he did. However this updated and revised version set in Miami from a script by Oliver Stone is very much worth watching even though it's almost three hours long.First of all, Al Pacino is riveting as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee released from prison by Fidel Castro in 1980 who arrives in Florida with a yearning to rule the world and a huge chip on his shoulder. His character is an extreme version of the ""live fast, die young"" species, the kind of guy who takes extreme chances and fears nothing. It is a shame that it is not obvious that for every one of the Tony Montanas in the world who actually made it to the top of the cocaine pile, there are thousands who weren't able to dodge the bullets and died not just young, but very young.Second, there is not a dead spot in the whole movie. Stone's action-driven script and DePalma's focused direction compel our attention. If you can stand the bestial mentality and the animalistic flash culture of the drug lords and their sleazy world, you might even want to see this twice.What I found myself watching closely was Michelle Pfeiffer at twenty-something, strikingly beautiful and totally degenerate as the cocaine-addled moll. Also very much worth watching was Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony Montana's sister Gina. The big brother/little sister incestuous theme (from the original Scarface of 1931 starring Paul Muni and directed by Howard Hawks) was craftily prepared and reached a striking climax (if you will) in the scene in which Gina tells Montana that he must ""have her"" (that's not exactly the words she used) since he won't let anybody else have her. The touch of necrophilia that followed was perhaps gratuitous.What I loved was the way DePalma reminded us again and again of how trapped the characters were by their desperate indulgences, the expensive liquor, the cigars, the cocaine, the stacks of money that took hours to count by machine. The scene in which Pfeiffer takes a snort of cocaine, a puff of a cigarette and a swallow of booze one after the other as the only thing she knows how to do in this world (with the white powder still on her nostrils) was wonderful in its piteous effect. I also liked the scene in which Montana, seated in his black leather chair with his initials in gold lettering, surrounded by his security video screens, dives into a pile of cocaine and comes up with it on his nose. Reminds me of the old doper saying, ""Too much is never enough.""The shoot 'em up finale of course was much, much overdone and about as realistic as a John Wayne barroom fight, but I loved the way Pacino played Montana near the end as a kind of paranoid Napoleon, the little guy who wanted to rule the world now finished and insane. Note, by the way, in how many scenes Pacino played a very vigorous persona sitting down.In a way this is in the final analysis a morality tale, a kind of very flashy ""crime does not pay"" saga not because the cops will get you (they don't) but because the life itself will corrupt you beyond anything human. Those who live by the gun will die by the gun, and there is no security among murders and thieves.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Scarface
106,sme_no_densetsu,"""Every dog has his day""",8,10 August 2008,"Brian De Palma's ""Scarface"" is something of a modern classic, although it was based on a film that preceded it by about fifty years. Here, screenwriter Oliver Stone reimagines Scarface as a Cuban immigrant determined to claw his way to the top of the drug world.Al Pacino gives an excellent performance as the title character. Love him or hate him, you've got to admit that Tony Montana (aka 'Scarface') is a vividly realized character. The supporting cast is surprisingly good as well, with Michelle Pfeiffer and others holding their own in scenes with Pacino's larger-than-life character. Strangely, the film was completely shut out in terms of Oscar nominations in what history has shown to be a fairly weak year.Oliver Stone's screenplay is quite good and has become a key reference point for gangster films that have followed. It actually stays relatively close to the framework of the original screenplay by Ben Hecht while amping up the violence considerably. Along with supplying several memorable quotes, the script also does a fine job of delving into the private lives of the main characters.De Palma's direction is well-handled throughout and the film has a distinct look. From the refugee camps to the Babylon club the film does a fine job of contrasting the highs and lows of Scarface's rise and fall. However, I must say that I don't care for the score/soundtrack very much. It's got an unmistakable early 80's sound that, in my opinion, has not aged well. No doubt that is a matter of taste, though.Does this film deserve to be labeled a classic? I think so. My only complaints are the music and the slightly bloated length. However, the high points of the film easily overshadow any shortcomings. It goes without saying that this is essential viewing for any fan of gangster films.",Scarface

108,Howlin Wolf,Never underestimate the lure of ambition...,10,9 June 2007,"I love this film, and I'm not someone who's weighed down by gold chains or sees it as an instructional tool. Nor is Roger Ebert, so that dismantles one stereotype right from the start. I love the moody synthesized music used as an opener. I love the film's first stroke of genius in updating the basic story so that it includes footage of Castro's actions, and the subsequent arrival of many Cubans on American shores. Straight away an ominous feeling kicks in and you understand that you have a whole subculture of people starting at the bottom rung on the economic ladder. Some will want to make their way honestly and contribute positively to the community around them, but there will always be a few individuals who choose to circumvent the hard-working route and instead get rich and fat quickly on ill-gotten gains.I love Al Pacino's perfect display of sneering insouciance, directed at everyone right from his introduction as Tony Montana. I love the way he embraces the myriad flaws of the man and expands upon them the further into the story we get. I love the honesty with which the narrative details his ruthlessness - there are no friends in Montana's world, only people who can do something for him. I love it when he achieves every material pleasure he wants and is still not happy. I love his topple from the peak of an empire. I love the sheer braggadocio with which Pacino executes every last defiant gesture. I love the fact that Oliver Stone's script was written from experience during a time when he was a man who had been seduced by demons of his own. All of this I love, and yet I would hate to idolise Tony. It's a warning against over-reaching oneself that is the equal of anything Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, for example...

110,KUAlum26,Say Hello to....film infamy!!!,8,31 January 2007,"The Al Pacino of film before Scarface could be a study in rising tension through the large,scared-yet-determined and world weary brown eyes of a strange but charismatic actor. The Pacino of post-Scarface seems to be heavier on World-weariness,rising VOLUME and generally less conflicted character study(some exceptions:Sea of Love and Insomnia). To me,this movie sort of is the watershed his career;in other words,what you the viewer could expect from him started to turn after this film.Undoubtedly,this movie is meant to be as one-note,over-the-top and stinging as piece devoted to crime drama and gangsters as possible. Cribbing the same rise-and-fall of the gangster as anti-hero as the 1932 classic,Brian DePalma's direction of OLiver Stone(neither of whom would know subtlety if the definition were read to them)'s screenplay,charting the rise and fall of Cuban ex-pat Tony Montoya(Pacino,seething and fidgety from scene one),who is one among thousands of faces that were dumped on our shores during the period in Spring of 1980 when Fidel Castro had decided to ""clean up"" his country AND stick it to his northern,non-Marxist neighbors by loading up all the undesirables of the nation and leaving them on the shores of Miami.From the get-go,MOntoya wants to be something special,something powerful,something strong and he knows that this country he's been sent to eyes him with suspect and contempt,so he believes(perhaps correctly)that his best avenues for ""making it"" in the land of the free and home of the brave is to pick up in the drug trade. Along with his best friend Ramon(Steven Bauer),he goes about rising through the ranks of Miami's drug-world until HE is the numero uno in the trade. Of course,with a rise this turbulent and violent,coupled with Tony's own paranoia and delusions,this rise and ascent will not be long and the denouement will not be without a VERY bloody price.Featuring memorable turns of support by Mary Elizabeth Mastroantonio(in a particularly memorable role IMO as Tony's sister,for whom his loyalty and love borders incestuous),Michelle Pfeiffer(as his less-than-enthused girlfriend),Robert LOggia(as a stubborn boss who uses Tony as he mistrusts him)and F.Murray Abraham(pre-Oscar),this movie never intends to be particularly thoughtful or methodical.This is meant to hit a note,and give a larger-than-life screen talent like Pacino a chance to chew scenery,and it works on both counts.This is a sledgehammer treatment of the early '80s world of drug crime,and whether you clutch this film to your bosom or not,it is vastly effective. Film infamy in the form of everyone from average Joe video gamers to ESPN anchors using quotes from it only make that more evident.",Scarface
111,pyrocitor,The World is Yours,9,5 February 2006,"In Scarface, director Brian De Palma's explosive portrait of a Cuban immigrant turned drug lord, 1983 audiences were treated to an unexpected change of viewpoints. The focus of this near 3 hour film was detailing the rise and fall of a drug dealer - who wasn't portrayed in a strictly negative fashion. Although common in films today to have an antagonistic figure as the protagonist, it must have been truly shocking for it's time - that we as an audience are expected to, at parts sympathize with or even feel sorry for a man of said profession. And although certain aspects of the movie have admittably dated (the early hip hop soundtrack in particular screams of the 80s, but as a whole this doesn't detract from the mood of the film as much as is often complained) the simple storyline of uncontrollable greed and ambition and their consequences is still as easily recognizable and identifiable as it was when first released. But Scarface isn't one of those controversial movies which only become famous due to their controversial nature - it is a truly compelling portrait of a man who went from having nothing to having virtually everything he ever desired, fueled only by his relentless ambition. And though the film does toe the line of running too long to the point of getting tedious, it remains entertaining enough despite its predictable and not terribly original storyline. This is mainly due to the casting of Al Pacino in this iconic, career defining role. Pacino brings Tony Montana to life in a way no other actor ever could have, and easily elevates the film to its classic status. He is present in almost every scene, and his fiery intensity keeps the film captivating for every second he is on screen.And although this really is Pacino's movie, he is ably backed by a strong supporting cast. Steven Bauer is charming and easily likable as Manny, Montana's only true friend during his rise to power. Michelle Pfeiffer is stunningly beautiful and tremendously effective as Montana's trophy wife with no real life of her own. Her performance has been criticized as being dull, but she is ultimately playing a dull character, and is therefore only playing the part. (she also comes very much alive near the end, during frustrated fights with Montana) Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also turns out a strong performance as Montana's rebellious younger sister. Robert Loggia plays the character of the now ridiculously stereotypical drug lord well, if not in a particularly original fashion. And F. Murray Abraham comes off as wonderfully dislikable as Montana's distrusting rival during his rise to power. Scarface may not come across as quite as intense and controversial as it did back in 1983, but the power of its storyline still holds true today. It's true that De Palma certainly didn't skimp on the blood or swearing, and the subject matter of Montana's profession is never held back from the audience, but it is ultimately Pacino who brings the film to life, and makes it so incredibly watchable, even today. It is really his movie, and his fiery intensity guarantees that even when pushing three hours, Scarface never fails to be interesting. -9/10",Scarface
112,chrichtonsworld,One of the best gangster movies around!,9,8 January 2007,"One of the best gangster movies around! This is a real classic. When it is on, i will watch this movie and keep on watching. The movie never gets boring,with an exception to some scenes with Michelle Pfeifer (who is just annoying and in my opinion not a good actress). I understand that this movie is a remake of a movie made in 1932. Which was based on events of organized crime during the thirties. Although most of the story of the 1983 version is fiction,some elements are based on real facts of the drugs mafia in the eighties with reference (example character ""Sosa"" from a large drugs cartel) to Escobar who was a real kingpin! The performance of Al Pacino is what give this gangster movie a special touch to the genre. He is not a simple character. He is smart and ambitious and has got big ""cohones"" (balls,guts). He can be a bastard but also shows some moral when he refuses to blow up a car because the target's children and wife are also in it. Which ultimately will be the cause of his death in the end. It is nice to see the effects of cocaine on ""Tony Montana"". At one time he doesn't trust anybody,not even his best friend,with a real dramatic consequence.

The character Tony Montana is instantly seen as a role-model to many young people today. Al Pacino will always be remembered as Tony Montana.",Scarface
115,lambiepie-2,The 80's and how not to live them...,10,22 June 2003,"Ya know when one looks at this Brian DePalma film today, I'm sure there has been a lot of criticism about how dated it is. Also, about the violence. When I looked at this film on VHS when I was 20, I thought it was ulta-violent and gritty as well. But I didn't get 'it'.A few decades go by and man, how I know how much I didn't get in this film!! This is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30's/40's. How can you improve upon a classic? Ya don't. But you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the ""new immigrants"" during the most greed ridden decade, the over indulgent 80's. DePalma, Stone and the gang present an ambitious, disturbing and darn right good film.Yes....Disco was dying and New Wave/Punk were taking over but these immigrants from Cuba who had to make a new home in Florida couldn't tell the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted but how to get it???? To these immigrants, there was only one way to get it in Florida where they were..by having lots of money and to get the money, you had to take over running a drug empire.Al Pacino was fantastic to me as Tony Montana, the ""little train that could"". What an amazing way to have your lead character look at America: to fight, kill, steal. lie, cheat all to get -- ""the money, the women and the power.""That's what Tony saw as the American dream.He wanted it, he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it. Tony Montana's command of the English language was heavily saturated with the ""f"" word but what did you expect, Emily Post's finishing school for him and his co-horts? Look at how they CAME to America, what they knew, what they were exposed to. This is the way Tony and his crew chose to ""be all they can be in America."" It was all about the power. Tony Montana would and did ANYTHING to achieve it..it all its violent, lying, stealing, crooked, thieving glory.The part of the film that personified the 1980's to me, is the money laundering. Tony's crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank. Did those around Tony and his crew care? At the clubs where he spent and drank? Nope. Money was money and with money, you get the power. Tony was living high off the hog. He and his pretty blond American trophy he married played well by Michelle Pfieffer.After Tony Montana's rise to power, he finds out its really crappy up there. He's riddled with doubt, he's drug addicted, he's paranoid, he's surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody take-over, his trophy 80's American blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore, he needs to keep atop of his empire because...he's going down. And down he goes in a horrific violent fashion, but again I ask, what do you expect?This is the quintessential 1980's film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the American Dream...to obsession. It's violent, bloody, overly so..but it drives the point disturbingly home. Not all Cubans thrown out of Cuba who landed in Florida in the 80's were anything like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But the showing of how miserable the 1980's were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the USA to ""be somebody"" and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in America.Makes you wonder -- has anything from then -- been learned today?",Scarface

For pure entertainment value I can't think of many better. This film is a total blast, a hugely entertaining piece of cinema and one of the few three hour long films that seems to fly by.If there's one area in which 'Scarface' is lacking, however, it has to be the rather generic and predictable plot. The focus in this film is very much on the action and violence and, at times, it feels like the plot isn't given much thought, or at least it isn't the priority. That takes nothing away from the enjoyment of 'Scarface' though, which is a true gangster classic and unquestionably one of the best films of the 80s.",Scarface

120,mattymatt4ever,A huuuge disappointment! Pacino's worst!,3,30 March 2001,"""Scarface"" is an over-the-top disaster that runs too long and tries too hard.  It's pretentious in every aspect, including the performances.  First of all, I'd like to establish that I'm a huge Pacino fan.  This was his only role I wasn't pleased with.  He overacts way too much in this movie, and looks more like he's just having fun with the accent.  That's another thing that bothers me about movies like this.  If you want to make a movie about Cuban immigrants, HAVE THEM SPEAK CUBAN!!!  I can deal with the subtitles. But instead we're stuck with these phony accents.  The minute I saw Robert Loggia and F. Murray Abraham on screen, as Cubans, I was confirmed that this film reached the bottom of the barrel.  When was the last time you saw two Hispanic people who just recently came to the country speak English to one another?  It happens almost never.  And it's very unconvincing.  Hell, I have Hispanic friends who've been in this country for a long time and they still speak their language to their other Hispanic friends.  And I think many filmmakers take that flaw for granted.However, I don't agree with the majority who believe this film sets the record for excessive profanity.  I think the main reason why it had lots of profanity was b/c of its running time.  But face it, I've seen filthier. ""The Big Lebowski"" was about an hour less in running time and had approximately 244 ""f"" words--and that doesn't count the other curse words.",Scarface

Not family friendly so I don't recommend watching this with your kids or your gran - lots of bloody violence, drugs and bad language. Brian DePalma brings Oliver Stone's vision onto the big screen vividly with plenty of 80's neon colourings and opulent style. You may find yourself routing for the bad guy as Pacino's Tony Montanta can seem divided between success and gain, but with occasional morals too. Where Pacino's Michael Corleone was more thoughtful, Tony Montana is the flip-side and more reactive and destructive.

122,jhclues,Dynamic Performance by Pacino,8,30 June 2001,"In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster, and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was `Scarface,' starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.  The story begins in May of 1980, when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States.  125,000 left Cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in America, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted.  But not all.  Among the `Marielitos' who streamed into Florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of.  And they, too, saw America as a land of opportunity, even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier.  And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to his associates as `Caracortada.' Scarface.Now that he was free of the yoke of Communism under which he had grown up, Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida, he was determined to have it all.  Wealth and power-- that was Montana's dream, and he would get it by doing what he did best, beginning with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia).  Lopez, it seems, had a brother in Cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of Castro's goons, a man who, having outlived his usefulness to Castro, had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in `Little Havana,' along with Montana and all of the Cubans just off the boats, where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives.  And in short order, Montana sees to it that Lopez's brother has been avenged, and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of America.Lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the favor gets Montana and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), released from the holding camp, and puts them to work.  In his day, Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but Lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative: Cocaine.  Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life, but once he has a taste of it, Montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs Lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be:  At the `top.'  With a cold-blooded, iron will, Montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the cost.  but before it's over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he'll pay it; but for a brief moment, perhaps he will know what it's like to be The Man.  And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.In step with De Palma's vision, Pacino plays Montana larger-than-life, and he does it beautifully.  From the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did), to the body language and the attitude, he's got it all, and it makes Montana convincing and very real.  What he brings to the role is nuance and style, in a way that few actors (De Niro would be one) can.  This is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way, nor is there anything about Montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but Pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character, even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him.  It's quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance.Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as well, in the role that put her on the path to stardom.  As Elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of Montana's dream, Pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense of something going on underneath, while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance.  She, like Pacino, definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and sultry demeanor.The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein).  An excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed `Traffic,' and `Blow,' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of Peckinpah's `The Wild Bunch,' De Palma's `Scarface,' originally panned by critics, has since been cited by many as being the definitive American gangster saga.  Much of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing.  But if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end.  And like many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time.  But the reward is always worth it, and that's the way it is with this film.  I rate this one 8/10.",Scarface
123,TOMASBBloodhound,Pacino's intensity fuels this one.,8,27 May 2003,"Scarface is the story of a Cuban immigrant (Pacino) who travels to Miami during the Mariel Boat Lift of 1980. He and his pal (Steven Bauer) begin as small time enforcers for a local crime boss, but Pacino's ruthlessness quickly moves him to the top of the pecking order in the South Florida drug trade. Michelle Pfeiffer plays his love interest.The film is notorious for its numerous (and often graphic) violent scenes. Pacino's character Tony Montana is perhaps one of the most psychotic protagonists ever put on film. He produces one liner after one liner as he kills off the competition. This film has an official web site where you can listen to them to your heart's content. The rest of the cast is terrific, but Al totally steals the show.This film is very good, but not perfect. Some members of the Latino community may not like the fact that Bauer is the only real Cuban-born major member of this cast. The film has a dated early 80s musical score which seems totally inadequate by today's standards. Another problem with this film is its incredible length. Considering how the conflict of this film is wrapped up at the conclusion, one is left to wonder why in the heck it took so long to get there.That said, Scarface is still a very good film. Pacino's intensity and the blistering violence hold your interest. Those two things are what you'll remember from this De Palma outing.4 of 5 starsSo sayeth the Hound.",Scarface

Miami, superbly photographed, looks all too likely a location for such nefarious dealings.

125,cultfilmfan,Scarface,5,6 February 2005,"This review of Scarface, is of the 1983 version directed by Brian DePalma. The film is about Tony Montana, who is a criminal from Cuba, who comes over to America. He starts out by working in a fast food restaurant and then soon ends up working for a drug lord in Miami. Tony, soon makes a name for himself and starts to deal drugs and becomes a crime lord himself. The film deals with drugs, deceit and violence as well. Scarface, has become a very popular film and has even become a cult film with a big legion of fans who quote the films and wear t-shirts of the main character. There is also a video game of this film in the works. I saw this film because of the numerous recommendations I got to see it and plus I'am a big fan of director Brian DePalma, but overall I was disappointed with the film. It was basically nothing more than a big budget Hollywood action film. The film had no character development so you hardly knew the characters and the movie jumps around a lot and often gets muddled in it's storytelling. The film also lacked Brian DePalma's great direction. He usually has a dark stylish look but this film does not have it. It looks too Hollywood and too mainstream. The film feels this way too. It really did very little for me. It was entertaining but I'm probably not going to see the film again or remember much of it in later years. This is a disappointment for DePalma but you do have your group of dedicated fans who would say that I'am dead wrong.",Scarface
126,tbills2,"OK, I'm Reloaded!!!!",10,3 July 2010,"Ya, you are right...Scarface is poorly written...the dialogue is too simplistic. Do you even know who Oliver Stone is? The person who wrote Wall Street, Platoon, and about a half-dozen other classic films, just got it wrong, huh? More like you got it wrong. Aside from Goodfellas, I feel Scarface has the most realistic dialogue of any movie. None of the lines are romanticized, it all seems natural and true. Do you think a Cuban refugee turned drug kingpin is going to be an elegant and articulate speaker? Tony Montana is a savage, and Al Pacino does a truly awesome job of portraying him. Scarface is seriously one of the most entertaining movies ever. The only knock on it is that is does not have great depth, but that's just comparing it to the other all-time best films. It has plenty of subtleties going on though, thanks to Oliver Stone. Here it is - Scarface has more great lines than any other movie, ever.+ Hector the Toad: So, you got the money? Tony Montana: Yep.

127,The_Movie_Cat,"""Nothing exceeds like excess.""",8,10 December 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
I hired this video out as I looked forward to the sight of Al Pacino wearing woollen knitwear. However, when I got home I suddenly realised that I'd misread the title  I thought it was called Scarfface. But this matters little as we get Al fully immersed in a Cuban character, coming over all intense and fiery.The film is the ultimate exercise in excess, though works because it starts on such a low-key note. The intensity builds gradually, subtly, until we're left with what is, unless I'm mistaken, a small Christ analogy from De Palma. In many ways the film shouldn't work at all. A screenplay by Oliver Stone and incidental music from Giorgio Moroder? Yet work it does, with Moroder's downbeat, oppressive score perfectly theming the piece. The only slight missteps the film takes are in the final hour, with an eighties MOR tune playing over a sequence of images. Debbie Harry contributes to earlier segments of the movie, though this is part of the background music. Here the music is laid over the top, like Dirty Dancing or a John Hughes movie. And it's also a little incongruous seeing hitmen raid Tony's (Pacino's) house to the strains of drum machine electropop. But other than these leeettle discrepancies the film is on sure ground all the way. In fact, such full-on tactics only serve to mirror the demented nature of the screenplay.Pacino is on excellent form, spitting, yelling and elevating the ""f"" word to an art form. Best example is obviously his chat-up line to future wife Michelle Pfeiffer: ""you got a look in your eye liked you ain't been f****d in a year."" Though a later scene where he refuses to assassinate a man because his wife and children are in the car with him shows a touching layer of morality. And when the film concludes with Pacino, face plastered in cocaine, expressing non-platonic love for his sister and inviting about 50 hitmen to say hello to ""my leeetle friend!"" you know that, if only he would give us a ""hoo-haa!"" as well then it would be perfection.",Scarface
128,gab-14712,Watch Al Pacino In All His Glory!,8,1 April 2020,"""Say hello to my little friend!""You know, when I saw Brian De Palma's gangster epic Scarface for the first time, I hated it. I thought it was a loud, ugly film that is over-the-top in the most gruesome way. As a gangster film, I was also comparing it to The Godfather films which also starred Al Pacino. I guess I did not like that the films are basically the polar opposites within the same genre. Flash forward many years later, I took away my original negative review away because I actually quite liked this film. It became a cult classic and I understand why. The film remains loud and over-the-top, but it's a gritty, dark, violent, and a more realistic take on the Latino gangster world of the 1980's.The film was written by renowned filmmaker/screenwriter, Oliver Stone. Stone allegedly was fighting cocaine abuse at the time which actually made him the perfect writer for the film considering everything he was going through at the time. Those familiar with film history may know of the 1932's Howard Hawks film of the same title, which coincidentally enough was the most violent film ever made at that time. Stone disliked that movie. He wanted to update that film and set it in a more modern time with drugs as the main culprit, not alcohol. Stone's script is a bit excessive in terms of the ""f"" word and violence, but Stone was able to give the film plenty of meat for the audience to gnaw on.The film was originally going to be directed by Sidney Lumet. Lumet wanted to blame the current presidential administration for the influx of cocaine in Miami. Producer Martin Bregman disagreed with his statement and booted him of the project. Brian De Palma, coming off 1980's interesting Dressed to Kill, was hired to take Lumet's place. Palma was able to inject his own vision into the story. Along with Stone's script, Palma made the film ultra-violent. When it was time for the MPAA to give the film a rating, it was rated X 3 times before Universal got involved and made enough tweaks to give the film a hard R. I found that interesting because X ratings were usually reserved for pornographic films and little marketing would have been done for the film. In any case, De Palma did a great job directing the film.The film follows the story of Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban gangster who immigrated to Miami during the Mariel boatlift of 1980. Montana felt that the humble work of an immigrant and making little cash is no use for him. Thanks to his friend Manny (Steven Bauer), he took a contract killing which allowed him to gather his green card. Shortly thereafter, he is working for drug lord Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and he brings all sorts of violence into Miami. He is very protective of his younger sister, Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) and becomes associated with Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), a big drug user herself. Now Tony wants it all and he will do what it takes to get it all. But is he ready to pay the hefty price?Al Pacino gives a delightfully overboard performance. He absolutely owns the character of Tony Montana. His portrayal as the gangster isn't the kind of portrayal where we sympathize with him, but we do get inside his head and understand the motives of his actions. He wants to go to the top, and isn't that really the dream for all of us? He definitely knows how to curse up a storm and how to kill a person in a shocking, violent way. The supporting turns are also excellent. Steven Bauer kills it here as Tony's partner. Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are very watchable and their careers were launched after this film. Pfeiffer is one of the best actresses of her generation, so I was surprised to see that both De Palma and Pacino were ready to pass on her, but Martin Bregman saved her career.There are so many incredible scenes here. The film has a basis in history, so I actually was able to learn quite a few things about the Cuban immigration to America and how Fidel Castro used this opportunity to send his prisoners, like Montana, over to the states as a price of revenge. Keep in mind that violence and blood are here throughout. There is a shocking scene involving a chainsaw. The final shootdown, where the film's well-known line of dialogue is said, is also crazy fun to watch. There are also some moments of levity. I like when Tony Montana is trying to bluff his way through customs in Florida.Scarface is one of the more realistic gangster portrayals you'll find. I mean its raw, gritty, and violent-just like it was in the real world. Maybe the technical aspects cannot reach the levels of the Godfather films, but maybe it doesn't have to. Some folks believe the film also has a cheesy 80's feel, but maybe you could blame Giorgio Moroder's awesome synth score. While the film was initially disliked upon original release, it regained popularity over time and people generally call it a classic. That is the same way it went for me; dislike upon first viewing but grew to like it eventually. This movie also shows why Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors. He is the MAN! It's near three hours long, so be prepared for it.My Grade: B+",Scarface
129,Angry_Arguer,Proves Stone knows how to right a kick-a script,9,21 June 2002,"Scarface is probably one of the most grand-scale epics of the 80s. Few films of that decade can rank with the length, scope, and excesses of the Al Pacino/Brian DePalma work. Definitely a view of what the cocaine industry can do to people, even if it IS fiction. I still cannot see how this movie is connected with the 1932 movie of the same name aside from the 'World is Yours' ad. If anything else, see the last 15 minutes of this movie as it is Pacino action unsurpassed until Heat.  Say ""NO"" to drugs.",Scarface
130,Angry_Arguer,A different sort of DePalma movie,9,3 September 2003,"There are three conflicting elements in Scarface that make it both interesting and pointless at the same time.  Conflict, both open and subdued, defines Scarface more than any other word.Brain DePalma: Before the Untouchables, I would have to say that this is his best movie.  He is not as creative visually as in other movies (Snake Eyes), but he uses the camera as an element of supporting the character rather than as a seperate character.  Notice how in so many scenes he uses subtle (slow) pans and tilts to add an addition mood to the screen.Oliver Stone:  As opposed to DePalma's subtlety, Stone's script (both an adieu to cocaine and a not-so-clever knockoff of Macbeth) is not afraid to go all the way.  So many elements here are obviously ripped by Quentin Tarantino for Pulp Fiction and (to a lesser extent) Reservoir Dogs.  Who said he was original?  Stone may not have finesse in his scripts, but he's not afraid to make declarative statements, whether they are true or not.Al Pacino:  I think Pacino spent too much time talking in a Cuban accent and not enough time developing character.  He is constantly passive until his situation explodes, then he leaps into the inferno with both feet.  To be honest, I don't think he's that good of an actor.  He and DeNiro aren't as understanding of their directors or scripts to make formidable characters.Overall, a different sort of gangster film that retreads the same ground with new takes and nothing else.  If anything else, this can be considered the 80s point that launched the ""drug empire"" concept.  3 out of 5 stars.",Scarface
131,sjanders-86430,Ben Hecht and Howard Hawks 1932 version,10,4 October 2021,"Brian de Palma directed. Oliver Stone took the screenplay from Hawks and Hecht. Al Pacino dominates every scene. He goes from dishwasher Cuban immigrant to wealthy drug lord in Florida. His mother distrusts him. His sister Mastrantino adores him. Pacino is 100% Sicilian from both parents. His good looks and powerful personality override his stature. His voice is deep and unique. Diane Keaton said his face is killer.He's definitely a Napoleon. Morado wrote the score which is secondary to the action. This 1983 film broke ground for the kind and amount of violence allowed in a film. Michelle Pfeifer's first husband takes Pacino on but it eends up in a shootout. Pacino marries Pfeifer, but there is no romance. Although Pacino is successful, his end is tragic. The film made money.",Scarface

He knocks someone off as a favor and is let out as a result. Soon he connects with the Miami underworld and finds himself working his way up. But his seething volatility which initially helps him make his way to the top eventually starts to play against him.From the very beginning to the end this is a riveting movie. It may be long and uneventful in parts, as is life, but with Al Pacino's fiery performance it is never dull. He is practically every scene and he easily dominates every shot that he is in. Whether his is roaring out profanity or just sitting he gets you. The eyes, the face, and it all makes for one of the great anti-heroes of the fictional world. A good production of Shakespeare's ""MacBeth"" whether on screen or stage, would have a hard time being better than the vile nature of the title 'hero' here. When you couple that with DePalma's direction it is a film that you simply should not miss.

135,Pedro_H,Pretty average rise-and-fall gangster pic that was unfairly savaged at the time.,7,14 May 2004,"A Cuban immigrant with a suspect past comes to America as part of a general clean out (by Castro) of social and political troublemakers.Interesting that this movie seemed to get a lot of people (pro critics especially) reaching for their poison pens. Maybe the fact that this was a remake of a well regarded movie that got them reaching for the special ink bottle or maybe because it told a lot of truths about America's drug saturation at that point in history? Whatever the facts the movie seemed to be singled out for special treatment which was unfair. While this is not a great movie, it is quite entertaining and is believable in outline form - if not technical detail.(No killer would open up a machine gun in a night-club when then they could lie in wait outside, for example.)I have never taken cocaine and intend never to do so. It is - for me - the ultimate masturbation drug: Stick it up your nose and then march around feeling great about yourself for twenty minutes before reality starts poking its ugly nose in again after which you repeat the cycle. Al Pacino's past and past associations make him ideal for playing criminals because he knows them. I am not suggesting that he was one though. He is well placed for this lead  role - which I understand is his favourite film role.The problem with this piece is that it seems happy to play by TV series/movies rules. Make sure you sprinkle in a bit of sex/violence/shock every twenty minutes throughout the piece because otherwise the audience will switch off. While hardly new - or explored in depth - this does raise the paradox of the criminal world: You have to deal with fellow criminals, but they always want to take your place if you are higher up the food chain!This is a movie that comes pretty much as expected. Indeed if I was to have formed a checklist of content before seeing it I would have put a line throughout most of the list as the titles rolled. It is - however - pretty gory at times and there is a scene with a chain saw that must be one of the most unpleasant pieces of business I have ever seen. Truly revolting.
Director De Palma always reminds me of the boxer who keeps getting world title fights and never quite becomes the champion. After a while you have to conclude it isn't all bad luck or bad timing - he just isn't good enough to go all the way!",Scarface

138,jdkraus,"""Scarface"" is a classical gangster flick, but there is much more to it than meets the eye.",10,25 March 2011,"This is not what many people have built this movie up as—a violent, intense, foul-mouthed, classic gangster picture. ""Scarface"" is more than that. Without giving too much of the plot away, the movie is about Tony Montana, a small time crook who dreams of making it to the top. The film very explicitly follows this man's life as he starts in the slums of Florida as a Cuban immigrant with nothing who ends up climbing the ranks to a big drug dealer that owns a mansion. The morals of the plot are the American Dreamfor a gangster and how it tears a person apart. ""Scarface"" is in a sense a tragedy. A man who gets everything only to destroy what he truly loves. People have regarded Tony Montana as Al Pacino's greatest role. I was somewhat skeptical about this role. I mean, an Italian actor playing a Cuba? C'mon. Yet, he pulls it off brilliantly, even retaining the proper accent. Pacino is completely over the top as Tony. He is brutal, selfish, paranoid, even an addict of the product he sells—just complete filth. Nevertheless, it is easy to sympathize with his character. No other actor could pull off Tony Montana as good as old Al. Though Pacino makes the movie, he isn't the only great actor in the film. Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Mary Elizabeth Mastratonio make the characters their own. It is easy to either like or despise the characters. Giorgio Moroder's score is simply breathtaking. As soon as I heard his score blast during the opening credits, I knew I was in for a ride. The cinematography by John A Alonzo is very unique; when a scene takes place during the day, it is bright, when it takes place at night, it is very dim. It seems that only natural lighting was used except for the indoor scenes, in which case the only lights present in the scene were used. Some may call this sloppy, but I think it fits the film perfectly—almost giving it somewhat of a low-budget look. De Palma's work as director could not have been better. This is the perfect film for him to direct, and he did so with finesse. Oliver Stone's script is also excellent. The other aspects of editing, production design, costumes, and even sound are sublime. If I had to say one bad thing about this film, it is the pace. Scarface is a slow moving film with little action—most of which is saved for the big, bloody finale. This does not make the film boring. The plot and the characters interactions with each other is more than interesting enough to keep the movie going. I thoroughly enjoy this film, and I can definitely see myself viewing it multiple times in the future.My rating: **** out of ****""Scarface"" is a classical gangster flick, but there is much more to it than meets the eye.",Scarface
139,AhmedSpielberg99,The Most Scorsese-esque Film Not Directed By Martin Scorsese!,9,21 July 2018,"Scarface is one of the most iconic, and one of the most quotable movies ever for a good reason. Throughout this movie I kept repeating WOW! There's no doubt that Oliver Stone is a great screenwriter, but with Brian De Palma behind the camera Oliver Stone's screenplay became very very entertaining, not just smart. I felt I was watching a movie its script is written by Aaron Sorkin, and is directed by Martin Scorsese! Al Pacino delivered a powerhouse performance as Tony Montana which, in my opinion, is the second best performance in his long career, just right behind his exceptional performance as Michael Corleone in The Godfather II. I don't want to say that Al Pacino's performance elevated the movie, because the movie is already great, but as a matter of fact, Scarface couldn't have become a classic without his iconic performance.Speaking of the Godfather, Scarface also is a movie that takes a bad guy and allow him to be a human. The result is a nasty, and vicious protagonist that you couldn't help but root for. But it doesn't stop here, In this movie I didn't only sympathized with Tony Montana, but I also sympathized with the people Tony Montana care about the most. I cared about his relatives that I was about to shed some tears, in a gangster flick!!!!The pacing is fast, and that was very acceptable. But at the last hour the movie dragged a little bit, but it picked up very quickly, and I found myself very engaged again.Also, I have to mention the De Palma's spectacular representation of the Magic City, Miami. And the movie's electrifying soundtrack. Scarface is one of the best gangster films of all-time that doesn't only entertain, but it also a great character study, and has an underlying moral philosophy. (9/10)",Scarface

There are plenty of movie out there that are like that, which are better.What I hear a lot of people say is that they liked this movie's ending the best.  I thought the ending was the worst part.**SPOILER AHEAD**A guy, who's mean to his wife, smuggles drugs, and kills his friends, die. Like I cared?  This guy was a jerk, and got what he was asking for, but HIS DEATH SCENE WAS CHEAP.  It was nothing original.  And they tried to make it seem tragic.  Like I gave a **** that he died.**SPOILER END**Also, I didn't think it was smart to cast an Italian guy to play a Cuban. I don't care if Pachino has 25% (if that) cuban in his blood, he looks Italian and he is considered an Italian.  Michelle Pfeiffer was a joke too.

And he does, as he becomes one of the most important drug lords of his days. But after every rise comes a fall...Your typical smack-in-the-face, epical crime/gangster movie with elements as honour and family played to the extend. Pacino is excellent (as is about everybody else from the cast), but Scarface can't really compete with The Godfather (I + II), Goodfellas or The Untouchables (a slightly different film, but it's my alltime favorite, so I love to bring it up :)).The element the movie suffers the most from is the love-story between Montana and Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), a drug-addicted powerlusted 'babe' (hardly IMO, oh well...) who's with Tony's boss until Tony kills him, takes over his business and apparently his woman. Why he would do that is a mystery to me, as Elvira doesn't bring much joy to him. Au contraire...Another thing I thought was strange: how did Tony make so many money, almost effortlessly? We hear him talking about millions of dollars, and that's just in his first period of reign. Is it really that easy?But overall, I enjoyed the story, although it's not the classic many people mistake it for (again, IMO).

Overall, this film is a bit overrated. Although its not a bad film. The story is nothing special, although one can relate to the main character, Tony Montana (Pacino) quite a bit. De Palma's direction is solid, and some of the scenes are truly great, and others are simply mediocre. As for the screenplay, it had some very influential famous lines by Montana, and was intriguing overall. The acting was pretty good, especially Pacino who totally comes out of his Godfather persona for the Tony Montana role. Steve Bauer and Mastrantonio are also good. Pfeiffer was not great, although her character was probably the most underdeveloped. Loggia plays Frank who is Montana's boss, and is pretty convincing, and Abraham plays a man who's also in Montana's organization. Overall a pretty good film, but not a gangster masterpiece (like Godfather, Goodfellas, etc). I liked DePalma's follow-up drug-dealer story starring Pacino, Carlito's Way, more than this as I thought the characters were more developed and the story was more interesting.

145,virek213,Don't get high on your own supply,7,7 January 2002,"Ostensibly a reworking of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic, director Brian DePalma's 1983 crime epic SCARFACE remains one of the most hotly debated movies of modern times.  Although I myself cannot quite call this a masterpiece along the lines of, say, the GODFATHER films, I do think it captures the life of a criminal as well as any film has ever done.Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay to SCARFACE, so it not surprisingly also has a political slant to it.  The film opens with the 1980 Mariel boat lift, in which Castro allowed as many as 125,000 Cubans to join their families in the United States, free from his totalitarian regime.  The complication is that twenty percent of those who fled to America were known criminals.  One of the latter is Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban punk who gets in on the ground floor of an increasingly lucrative trade in Miami's Cuban community; the buying and distribution of cocaine.  He works his way up the ladder of the American dream because of the advice given to him by his mentor (Robert Loggia): never underestimate the other guy's greed, and don't get high on your own supply.But even as he makes connections with the Colombian drug kingpins who supply him with what he needs, Pacino also becomes increasingly power-crazy, addicted to his own supply (against Loggia's advice), and paranoid.  He alienates himself from virtually everyone around him, including his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) and sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  In the end, he steps onto the toes of the wrong drug lord (Paul Shenar), who sends assassins to Pacino's Miami villa, resulting in a ferocious and hugely violent, blood-drenched showdown.To this day, SCARFACE remains a touchstone movie for a lot of very good reasons.  It is a withering critique not only on the excesses of greed, money, crime, and corruption, but also on our own anti-Communist paranoia which gave Castro carte-blanche to export his worst scum to our shores and thus accelerate the amount crime and death associated with the drug problem. The way the South Florida drug underworld lifestyle is depicted by both DePalma and Stone is very true to the essentials.  And although I personally found Pacino's Cuban accent to be overdone at times, his performance (four-letter words and all) was and still IS the center of this film.But SCARFACE is not necessarily the easiest film to like.  At two hours and fifty minutes, even with an interesting political undercurrent, it does seem longer than is really necessary.  The amount of times the ""F"" word is used (or variations of it) is perhaps a bit grossly overdone (I lost count of the number at around two hundred), although this too is perhaps close to the truth of its story.  Finally, SCARFACE is still one of the most violent films ever to have come out of Hollywood.  The chainsaw scene in the Miami apartment, the hanging from the chopper, and the ultra-gory shootout rank among the most violent sequences ever filmed.  I can recall of only four films that have this kind of nerve-shattering violence: THE WILD BUNCH, SOLDIER BLUE, TAXI DRIVER, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Still, Pacino's performance and a fairly good, albeit slightly cheesy, music score by Giorgio Moroder are worth giving SCARFACE a '7' rating.  But this is definitely NOT a film for young kids; it is rated 'R' for some very good reasons.",Scarface

149,rajdoctor,Scarface,7,7 August 2007,"This is called a cult movie by cinegoers.The story is about an immigrant Tony Montana (Al Pacino) from Cuba who has come to live the American dream. He is a hard core criminal and starts by being in detention, where he plots a murder. Next, he moves in the Florida where he starts working as a dish washer on a road side joint. The attraction of money and power drives him into taking chance with one drug deal that goes miserably wrong where his friend is killed, and he in turn kills other gang members. With his daring, he starts climbing the ladder of drug dealers, and reaches the pinnacle of power and wealth and gets more and crazier (due to drug addiction). Finally he is shot by his own beloved sister before being brutally killed by invading gang in his own palatial home.The movie wholly belongs to Al Pacino, who breathes terrific life and energy to such a difficult and negative role. This is one the best anti-hero film I have watched coming out from Hollywood. The story very much resembles like a 1980s B-grade Hindi movie.I hear that this person was real and the story is inspired from real life incidents. But without Al Pacino this movie would had been totally rubbish. It is Al Pacino's antic and historics, weirdness and style, confidence and arrogance that floats this movie through out.The character though real is so unbelievable, but being a larger than life portrayal of an anti-hero needs such exaggeration.The film sets are gaudy and over the top. The characters are one-sided and sketchy. There is too much of violence. There are a few good musical scores that give good 80s flavor.I can imagine how this movie would have been a craze when first released. It still engages  but the time context is different now.The only problem with such movies  I think  is that it promotes unrestrictive violence and mayhem. It gives a message  being bad is good! Nothing wrong with that if common people on the street understand the difference between reel and real life and not try to imitate crime  especially in the volatile world of today where getting and using weapons is child's play!

150,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,25 February 2021,"Stone, Pacino, and De Palma must really think that ""Money is not everything"" is an original and profound message ... Scarface is often remembered as one of the essential gangster films. Although The Godfather saga is the most revered of its kind, this one is the film whose phrases and scenes are the dream of any young adult with limited knowledge of cinema. But after about 30 years, the feature that took so long to be cool ironically now looks just like any action movie from the 80s, with well-done shooting scenes. Only. Besides, it is just that show of endless indulgence that marked his time, with a lot of style and little substance. Scarface was the game changer for many careers. For Al Pacino, his performance here can be seen as the beginning of his over-the-top climb, which slowly but surely started to erode his technique, turning him into nothing more than a caricature of himself, an exaggerated and less inspired by the great actor that was once. For Oliver Stone, it was the film that revealed it, having released a string of successes a few years later, giving him some Oscars. And for Brian De Palma, it marks the point where his love of visual extravagance began to dominate his sense of narrative discipline. His later works would, at the very least, be irregular. In remaking the 1932 classic directed by the iconic Howard Hawks, Stone and De Palma change the scene from Chicago to Florida and change the central crime, from alcohol smuggling to cocaine trafficking. The original was inspired by real-life gangster Al Capone, who would have liked the film so much that he had several copies ordered. While the two films feature a character who rises to the top getting rid of his former bosses, this version adds the twist of having a foreign protagonist. By making Tony Montana a Cuban immigrant, the filmmakers tried to make some kind of satire from the American dream, but everything is done in an obvious and too cliché way. We can't care about the plot or the main character, as his personal arc is poorly presented and developed, besides sounding manipulative, as if Montana ""cares"" for his mother and sister to erase the fact him being a murderous drug dealer. And the ending is particularly cynical, as it tries to make us sympathize with him for the fact that he was unable to kill a woman and a child ... Well, then all the other hundreds of people who had their lives destroyed by the drugs he trafficked do not matter huh? It is a film that lacks empathetic figures and originality. In fact, Scarface is a film that seems much more interested in showing bloodbaths in the best way than building a minimally interesting social commentary, or presenting scenes with wider repercussions and meanings. No one can deny De Palma's brilliance in terms of set design and choreography, but once you stop admiring a particular scene or deliciously caricature and ridiculous construction of Montana de Pacino, there's not much else to justify the length of the film. In short, it is a film as deep as a teaspoon. Scarface for may seem like a luxurious and excessive film, but the truth is that it has nothing to say other than the old sermon ""Crime does not pay"". The problem is that it takes us a long time to know who Tony really is, and when we do, we don't like it. Here, all the boxes of a cliché criminal tale are checked: Fast rise? Checked. Dazzling and ostentatious with money? Checked. What of the pedestal for ambition and arrogance? Checked. If the script had been less predictable and the final 20 minutes had been better directed, this could have been an excellent criminal drama. You can argue that this is the film that directly influenced Tarantino at the beginning of his career, but poor is the work that survives only from what was made of it and not from what it did. Scarface is a bloated and indulgent epic that leaves you delighted, confused, and exhausted at the same time. To appreciate it, it is necessary to suspend a great deal of critical thinking, to treat it as a sensory experience, and not as an intellectual challenge. Despite all its flaws and excesses, it is still a good choice for an uncompromised session with friends.Film seen on the 24th to the 25th of February 2021.",Scarface

152,RossRivero99,One of the greatest gangster movies ever made,10,11 May 2019,"Brian De Palma is arguably one of the greatest filmmakers of the last 50 years with classic films such as ""Carrie"" (1976) and ""The Untouchables"" (1987) to his name with this movie he has made his masterpiece and one of the finest movies about the mob ever put on film along with ""The Godfather"" (1972), ""The Godfather Part II"" (1974), and ""Goodfellas"" (1990), but unlike those movies it doesn't touch on the Italian mafia. Al Pacino stars in perhaps the finest and most manic performance as Tony Montana a Cuban exile who ends up in Miami and is desperate to find a way to make a living in America by any means necessary with his best friends Manny (Steven Bauer), Chi Chi (Angel Salazar), and Angel (Pepe Serna) in a refugee camp and as a result becomes a part of the mob. in order to make money and survive. Montana then meets a drug dealer named Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) who gave them green cards and a pardon for a murder they committed in Cuba. Then Montana becomes friends with another drug dealer named Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham), and falls in love with Frank's wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). This movie focuses so much more than Montana's life of drugs and crime it also focuses on his family relationships with his mother and his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) disgusted at the fact that he lives a life of crime, and is really a study on Montana's character but mostly doesn't portray him in the best way throughout the movie. The performances in the movie are rock solid with Pacino and Pfeiffer being the biggest standouts, and De Palma's direction is top notch with a very masterfully written screenplay by Oliver Stone. The movie is a remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster film of the same name with Paul Muni in the lead role which I still have yet to see.

They should have been wired, yappy, schizo, psycho and neurotic, but they weren't.Also - when Frank Lopez is about to be killed in his dealership, he crawls on his knees and begs to Tony, offering to pay him $10 000 000 not to be killed.That was just absurd...he whined like a baby...the guy was a high-roller and just caved in too fast...it didn't quite fit his character.With all the attention that Tony made in the bar and in the restaurant, nobody said anything...just not real.It was good, but as good as it was, it could have been better...However, it had some awesome lines - which will stand the test of time in cinematic history.I would have loved to see Tony Montana, after doing half a kilo of coke in one snort just sweating buckets, his eyes red and puffy, his lips ranting, his body shaking, his mind scattered and his character just ballistic and freaking...he did not...and that is where this film falls short.",Scarface

155,Antagonisten,Over the top,3,21 February 2005,"I had a lot of fun reading all the comments about this movie here on IMDb. It seems almost everyone agrees that this movie is a classic, almost to the point of being underrated (and a movie loved by everyone that is STILL underrated must be amazing!). I must say that i am of a different opinion. I would rather have to say that this is one of the most overrated movies of our time.The story of the Cuban immigrant going from having nothing to controlling the drug-trade in Miami, making millions and millions of dollars, is nothing spectacular. The same story has been made numerous times both before and after. This however is not necessarily anything negative. The story does have it's points. What i can't help feeling is that the story has been done so much better before. While there are many things separating ""The Godfather"" parts 1 and 2 from ""Scarface"", too many things to really compare them, the Godfather movies were still a so much better tale of an immigrants rise to criminal fame and riches.The main problem i have with ""Scarface"" however is that most of the time i don't even know if it's being serious or not. Simply because everything is so ridiculously over the top. Wardrobe, acting, music, cinematography and not least the dialog. It's all bordering on comedy, and sometimes quite blatantly stepping over that border. The most shining example is Al Pacino. A talented actor no doubt. But his accent here is... i can't even find the right word to describe it. It comes and goes through the whole movie, and his English is more broken in the finale than ever before in the movie (his English is WORSE in the end than it was when he first came to the US. ""Sayy helo to my liddle fren""?! And i don't even want to know what Michelle Pfeiffer did here, she was awful to say the least. It looks as though she felt completely out of place. And i can imagine that a frantic movie like this could make actors feel a bit strange.So this is an entertaining movie. But i'm entertained more by how bad it is than anything else. It brings out loads of laughter, but not from being smart or well-made, rather by being silly and overblown. Many lines of dialog are instant classics, but mostly because of the laughable way they are uttered. DePalma proves here more than anywhere that he is the king of ""style over substance"". I watch this, and i am entertained. But a classic it is not. I rate it 3/10.",Scarface
156,ronakkotian,Very over-the-top but consistently entertaining,8,6 September 2021,"I love gangster dramas so I've been meaning to watch Scarface for a long time. If there's one reason to watch Scarface, it's for Al Pacino's performance.Scarface follows Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant who arrives in Miami with nothing and goes on to become a powerful drug lord.Scarface has a lot going for it and it's very loud in its presentation of its story. Director Brian De Palma did not hold back with the film's violence and drug use which I liked as it added to the stakes of the crime world. The excessive and loud tone of this film worked in some ways and didn't in others. The over-the-top treatment of the story made the film consistently entertaining through its long 2 hour 50 minute runtime without having a single boring moment. The over-the-top nature of the film may have been intentional but it's something I'm not too sure on as it made some scenes, particularly the ending, very comical. Oliver Stone's screenplay is filled with great and iconic dialogues that keep the characters fun and interesting. The production design is grand and fits the film's bombastic personality very well. The music is also something I'm mixed on. At times, the music fits well with the 1980's time period but some of it comes off as very cheesy looking at it from today's point of view.What really kept the film going for me though was Al Pacino's performance. Pacino is fantastic as Tony Montana and brings forth the brutal and commanding presence of the character very well. I'll admit he's very over-the-top but the rest of the film is seemingly in the same tone which is why I think it works. Michelle Pfeiffer also does a good job essaying the role of a bored trophy wife. Steven Bauer is also great as Tony's friend, Manny. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was one of the standouts to me as Tony's sister, Gina, and conveyed the trouble she was going through very well.Scarface is a very entertaining gangster flick. It's got elements that may not hold up as well today and its excessive portrayal of the story can be divisive amongst viewers but I think it's definitely worth a watch regardless.",Scarface

158,christophe92300,De Palma has made a better gangster movie : Carlito's Way,6,13 November 2014,"In 1983, Brian de Palma, with the help of Oliver Stone, delivered Scarface, one of the most iconic gangster/mafia movie. The scenario, which depicts the lightning rise and fall of a Cuban political refugee who became a drug lord in 80's Miami, is solid overall but the movie undeniably would have benefited from a tighter editing because certain passages are a bit long, and the more the story progresses the more this lack of rhythm is noticeable, in the last 30-40 minutes it evens seems nothing is going on. Pacino is perfect in his role but you have to like the style, he's not far from overacting as often happens, and his character is so antipathetic that it's hard to relate to him which is inevitably penalizing. The rest of the cast is anecdotal, just think of Michelle « trophy wife » Pfeiffer. Scarface represents for a lot of people the quintessence of gangster movies, while other productions such as Goodfellas or Carlito's Way, from the same Brian de Palma, did a much better job.",Scarface
159,danielmanson,A classic,9,19 December 2020,"Well I have to say, for a 37 year old film, this really held up. Great story and just really well done. To be honest I'm just writing this for my personal collection of reviews, so I'm making this quite brief.The story telling was fantastic and really intriguing. The various characters were likeable, yet unlikeable at the same time. It was all just really interesting and I fully understand why this has a high rating and why it's considered a classic.I like to read the negative reviews of a film, once watched to see if they have a point. The common point was that Al Pacino was too ""over the top"" of a character. I have to disagree to be honest, I thought it was done really well. The way his outbursts were more frequent etc the more he did cocaine was great and well acted.The reason why I haven't given this a 10/10 is for 2 reasons. Firstly, the length of the movie. For me personally, I found myself losing concentration. Almost 3 hours long I just think for any film it's a bit too much and it can always be condensed. Secondly, it'd the rewatch factor, I personally don't think I'd watch this again. I think it's a phenomenal film, just something I wouldn't throw on again. It's very much a one time thing. I understand if people disagree with me there, but that's just my take on it not being 10/10.",Scarface

I find it to be my favourite film of all time, tying with the 2008 Rambo Film.There's a reason this movie is in the IMDb top 250. it teaches us what the real American dream is.To give the world something that is absolutely worthless and non-beneficial, and to get back everything that is valuable and Beneficial.",Scarface

162,harryplinkett14,"Fun, but flawed",8,27 October 2019,"The subplot with the anti-hero's family was shoehorned into this film to give it more 'depth', probably so critics wouldn't butcher it as nothing but an excuse to show violent scenes. But we didn't need that subplot to like Tony or to enjoy his journey to success and ultimate demise. I just hate it.
Also, the scene where they attempt to assassinate him makes no sense. The assassination attempt is so amateurish, and on top of that, the man who ordered it watches sports rather than waiting to hear what happened. He also forgets to put any guards on duty, so Tony can just walk in. Killing Tony, who always walks alone, often drunk and drugged up, would seem like a fairly easy thing.
And then no one ever seems to investigate that assassination attempt or the fact he had two guys, one of them an important police officer, killed. In this film, the police never seems to investigate any murders, at least not when it's convenient for the plot.
Then we have this narco-boss from South America, who for some reason needs Tony's help to kill a guy who has no protection whatsoever. As we learn, every important person in the country is being threatened by this guy, and for some reason, not only have they not had him killed a long time ago, but they need Tony to drive a car so they can kill him. These are the same guys who sent a team of what appears to be 100 guys to kill Tony, within hours. Why would they need Tony to be the driver?
Finally, the romance between Tony and his wife is non-existent, and I don't now whether it was meant to be non-existent, or the script fails to make us believe these people ever had true feelings for one another.Too much nonsense in this film. But it's fun. Would be more fun without the family subplot.",Scarface

A Classic That Requires A Huge Investment From The Viewer.,7,12 July 2019,"This was my favorite movie for a couple of years in high school, followed by 'The Godfather' (1972) for a couple of years as I matured a little (very little). There was a time where I would have just clicked 10 stars for this film and moved on to another film to watch and review. Realistically, I have probably started this movie (and watched at least 80 minutes) over 20 times... I have probably finished it over 10 times. As an honest movie reviewer in 2019, I can admit that I used to have a hard time finishing the film that I told the world was my favorite...The hard truth of the matter is that I really wanted 'Scarface' (1983) to be my favorite movie, but it wasn't. This isn't a perfect film. As a matter of fact, it is flawed in as many ways as it is great. The final product leaves the viewer exhausted, unhappy, and restless.Everything about this movie is extreme. Pacino is extremely good, the content is extremely violent, the film is extremely long, and it requires an extreme amount of emotion and time from the audience. But, if you can survive the 3 hours, you will have an imprinted emotional connection with the film that will last a lifetime.

165,willcundallreview,A just about very good gangster classic,8,15 May 2014,"Rating-8/10Scarface is a dark gangster film that has a great mix of dark and violent scenes mixed with near humorous parts which lighten the film up at certain times. With a lead role that makes this film better than just good, it also brings us good acting and some quotes that still are used in film folklore, worth a watch just to hear the memorable lines. I felt this film was just about very good, and here below is why so.The story as said is dark, it revolves around drug trading in 1980's Miami and a man bent on power to succeed. It is thrilling even at some times because it really makes you want to see what happens next and at times leaves you excited as to how Tony Montana will act upon a threat etc. The film has it's slow parts and can at times be a slight bit boring, but nevertheless the ending makes up for some of that with a big ending to a big story, a long story to wade through indeed.Al Pacino masterfully creates Tony Montana and brings him to be one the most famous gangsters in cinema, with his iconic voice and ever so crazy outbursts, you can't help but kind of like him(and his insanity). Michelle Pfeiffer does little to impress here I think and it is possible De Palma and Pacino were right when they said they didn't want her for the role. Steven Bauer as Manny is maybe the most well acted role ever but still manages to lighten the movie somehow and chips in well.I think the true man behind the camera here is Oliver Stone, he writes this so well and of course dealing with this own drug problems at the time, he probably felt he knew just what to do with the script. Stone writes well but Brian De Palma doesn't direct up to standards that the acting and writing are on, not a bad job at all but he never really brings the best out of every scene and can leave bits becoming stale and boring.There isn't really so much wrong with this, you could say there is too much violence and an overuse of it but I think at times it benefits from it and makes you more thrilled. I said about the directing, that could be classed as criticism and I also felt the camera work or maybe even the editing isn't done so well as some rather silly shots and the score quite often gets annoying here, the technical side has bits wrong with it in general.Gangster films fans should enjoy this as it mixes all you could want in gangster films together well and creates an even darker drug gang film. Don't watch if you dislike dark violence and things along that line as you will not enjoy, I will say it is also a powerful drama led in the role greatly by Pacino, but the violence contained in this might just throw you off it.Overall I give this a 8/10 meaning it is Just About Very Good, I think in the end that possibly Pacino just edges this over the line of just being good into very good with his brilliant portrayal. It is a long film nearly getting to 3 hours long but worth the watch for so many people who Ii know will just love not only the action scenes and the smartly written plot, but also the crazy tones of Tony Montana who just runs everything in this movie.",Scarface

I think it's tonally a lot closer to it's source material than it's usually given credit for. It's in many ways an old fashioned film, even telling a very key part of it's story using the type of montage you see in films from the 30's and 40's. All of the 80's gloss and extreme violence is layered on a plot that's beat for beat the same as Hawks's film. Pacino's performance has often been ridiculed for being oh so very big, but I'm not sure what anybody should expect in a portrayal of Tony Montana. He's a character almost completely lacking an inner life who subsists entirely by bluffing and and convincing others that he's stronger than them. He's all action without thought.",Scarface

It stays in the mind because it tries so hard to set a new record in violence and terror. I wonder what kind of reaction the makers of the movie expected from their public. Fear? Revulsion? Anger? Lust? Many scenes really are over the top and completely ludicrous, but I guess that is intentional. Why on earth should a Colombian drug dealer during an encounter in a stuffy hotel room be armed with a gasoline powered chainsaw? The chances that he'd himself die the first of carbon monoxide asphyxiation once he started the engine would be high. Well, maybe these are the wrong questions to ask and one should just enjoy (if that's the right word) the action. And Mr Pacino hitting a heap of white powder with his nose like a pecker bird might be worth the admission alone.It must be said, that the set design is very good with its mixture of real locations and slightly fantastic sets.

However, greed and power consumes Tony, and he digs himself into a hole he can't get out of. Scarface is a good movie, but you have to be in the mood to watch it.The popularity of this film among teenagers like myself is a little skewed. When the movie was re-released in 2003, everything went insane with the action figures, beach towels, t-shirts, and other merchandise. Unfortunately, most teenagers see this as a violent gangster film with lots of swearing. Cool, eh? Or they just want to jump on the Scarface bandwagon. None really see the entire message of the film, which is that greed is not a good thing. This entire movie is an entertaining message. Greed can screw you over. Oliver Stone did a great job conveying that in the script. Ironically, he went on to direct Wall Street, which contains a speech about why greed is good. The plot is good and the dialogue is intelligent (even though it contains hundreds of f-words). The only problem I had was that the movie could have been shaved down to 2 hours. The movie is 3 hours long, and it really drags in some scenes. The movie doesn't get really good until the last 45 minutes.The acting is superb. Al Pacino does his absolute best in this movie.

Activity to shoot such a picture with ingredients like 'drugs' or 'chessboard' from the poster shows that the knowledge we have of cinema needs another alter ego to persevere.

184,Cinema_Fan,The world wasn't enough. Tony Montana wanted everything!,8,21 July 2007,"Alphonse ""Scarface"" Capone (1899 - 1947) infamous reputation as gangster and crime Lord during the 1920's and 1930's had now reached the movies. It begins with Ben Hecht (1894 - 1964) writer of The Front Page (1931), Angels with Dirty Faces (1938) and Stagecoach (1939), and with director / writer Howard Hawks (1896 - 1977) who gave us such greats, as writer, The French Connection (1971) and The Thing from Another World (1951). Collaborating, during the early nineteen thirties, to write and direct the original Scarface of 1932. It is here, in this story that Oliver Stone (b. 1946) takes his lead as screenwriter for his contemporary adaptation of this gangster myth.Cuba was having very real and severe problems by the end of the nineteen seventies with its political, social and economic unrest and between April to October 1980, some 125,000 Cubans had jumped ship and sailed to the then Jimmy Carter administrative (1977 to 1981) US of A. The reason the exiles had to be stopped toward the end was that it was alleged that some 25,000, so far, of these self-claimed political refugees were convicts, mental patents and undesirables that Cuba no longer wanted on their home ground. America shut its gates, but the damage had been done. The likes of fictional Tony Montana, ex convict, had already arrived and planted his roots in the dark, dangerous and destructive world of America's drug world.Together, Brian De Palma (b. 1940) maker of Carrie (1976), The Untouchables (1987), Carlito's Way (1993) and Mission: Impossible (1996) and Oliver Stone have seized upon the golden opportunity and redesigned this classic myth into a contemporary setting.This ultra violent portrayal of one mans rise from the Cuban Freedom Camps to the Ivory Towers of the drug Lords and their trappings is a testimony to the narcissistic accessories of the early eighties America and its self abuse and destructive need for cocaine. This is simply a tale of supply and demand and one mans vision on how he is going to supply this demand, no matter the consequences. An agonising and extremely brutal underworld that Brian De Palma has depicted with classy extremes in the killing fields of the streets of America.Both fast paced and hard hitting, this epic journey from skid row to the affluent excess's and the slow slip into the abyss of madness and paranoia is astounding. These are uncompromising and unforgiving times, and Oliver Stones views on these people are of contempt. This is shown in a very rendering scene where Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer's character) and Tony Montana are having more than a discussion, at a restaurant table, about her womb being so polluted by drugs that she cannot give him the child he wants, and his own drug-filled ego getting the better of them both.It is in this climb to the top that we see more than what is being effected in his own life, that the style in which he has become accustomed can be more than infectious, and treacherous. It is his reconnection with his elderly mother and younger sister that has him seen as more than a dog of the streets but as a scorned son and much loved brother. Touching, maybe, but this is Tony Montana learning that when one has made his bed one has to learn to lie in it.And what a bed he has made, within its nineteen eighties throwbacks of style and music that the writings of Oliver Stone and Brian De Palmas delivery of excellent cinematography by John A. Alonzo (there are at least two wonderful panning shots, here, in Scarface that are just mesmerising, slow, deliberate and focused on its intent). Without question, this is Al Pacino's (b. 1940) greatest cinema achievement as the psychotic Montana whose American Dream slowly turns to nightmare and cold reality that his hell on earth is just as twisted as his hell in mind.""Scarface"" aka Tony Montana is a fine example of the American Dream, his right and privilege to take hold and make best his ambition to escape the poverty and destitution of his past and make good his future. However, let this be a stark warning, that when one sleeps with dogs one will wake up with fleas, but with Tony Montana this flea was to bite him hard, fast and without pity.Scarface: Extremely violent, extremely explosive, extremely honest and additive and without doubt cinemas most extreme and updated stance on the world of the Gangster myth. Say hello to Tony Montana.",Scarface
185,coldwaterpdh,The best DePalma ever did.,9,3 May 2009,"Along with ""Dressed to Kill,"" this is DePalma's masterpiece. Whereas ""Dressed to Kill"" is a brilliant mix between early Argento and Hitchcock, I think ""Scarface"" is a nice combination of the 1970's Italian crime exploitation flicks, (like those of Castellari,) and a brutal Sergio Martino slasher. (If you don't know what I'm talking about, check those guys out!) Violent as the day is long and filled with something to offend almost anyone, it is no wonder that ""Scarface"" has made such a mark on pop culture. It is appealing to almost anyone. Those who criticize Pacino's over-the-top portrayal of a Cuban guy need to get a grip; it was meant to be that way and anything less would not have been as entertaining. He becomes a caricature of himself and it really works. I mean, there are action figures made of the guy and I wouldn't even call this an action movie.The music, the acting, the direction and the flow of the story are masterful and history will prove that ""Scarface"" is one that will go down as a classic because it is one kickass movie, no doubt.9 out of 10, kids.",Scarface
186,jayjaycee,The rise and fall of an antihero,10,26 April 2020,"""Scarface"" is a 1983 crime drama directed by Brian De Palma starring Al Pacino and Steven Bauer. As many others probably did, I celebrated the legend's birthday as well by watching one of the most popular and mainstream gangster flicks of all time, a film I've been kicking down the road for way too long. Admittedly, this turns out to be a massive mistake, as this film is nearly perfect by all means. The main factor of this films success is without a doubt Pacino's versatile and above all menacing performance as rising gangster Tony Montana. He's definitely is absolutely credible in portraying a Cuban compatriot. From an authentic Cuban accent to his overall demeanour he was excellent, but what surprised me the most is how one of the most popular gangster film protagonists is undeniably one of the greatest antiheroes in cinematic history at the same time. Screenwriter Oliver Stone created an iconic main character with such a diverse personality that you really can sympathize with in a strange manner. Over the course of the film, Montana lives the classic American dream and literally goes from rags to riches. With a runtime of almost three hours one could mean that it has its lengths and might become boring after a while, but the screenplay never gives you the opportunity to lose track. There's always something more happening, and the suspense curve starts on a medium level and goes up continuously from there on. Never does it take a hit once and it's almost masterful to see something like that happen in such a long movie. Generally, the longer the movie, the higher is the probability that the film loses the interest of its audience at some parts (like some Scorsese flicks, for instance), hence I think it's nothing short of incredible that this film manages to perfectly avoid this common effect. If you need to look up a film with a perfectly paced plot development, this film is the showpiece example for this question. As I already stated before, all this wouldn't be possible if it wasn't for the force of nature of a person that Tony Montana is. The titular scar faced maniac is something I'd show a class when it comes to characterizing an antihero, because he's an extraordinarily conceptualised and multidimensional fictional character the film would be nothing without. In the beginning, he's a nobody, a political refugee who works as a dishwasher who tries to aim for the stars without any realistic plan, but he's ambitious and on top of that, determined and fearless. His intrepidity eventually pays off and gradually becomes more successful and doesn't seem to be willing to stop. What makes this character development so outstanding though, is the way he reaches his goal and how he secures his position. His insatiable hunger for power makes him totally unpredictable. The more power he gains, the more he disassociates himself from the values he used to believe in, and he more and more becomes a monster. This inexorably increasing greed simultaneously increases his mistrust and severe paranoia towards everyone and everything. While he still had a sense of rudimentary loyalty in the beginning, he's become more merciless from minute to minute. He would sell his own grandmother if she was a threat for is power status and it's evidenced by how he betrays every former associate and partner, even his mentor in the process and how he underestimates even the ones who are obviously more powerful than him. Pride comes before the fall and you can clearly tell that his judgement is successively tainted. The most fascinating thing is how it seems to never be enough to him, as many scenes show how he is palpably bored by his carefree life. Seriously, he seems to have everything he's desired, the wife, the wealth and the power, yet he is unsatisfied with it and desires more. For instance, the scene where he sits in his own office, drunk and hooked on an immense amount of cocaine and the way he still looks like the most bored human being on earth is one of the many scenes that made me smile for just how brilliant it was. Even though he went sky high and should be happy with the way he is, he still craves for a higher place that exists from his point of view. Furthermore, he depraves everyone around him, allies and foes alike and destroys all of their lives with his reckless behaviour. In the end, he can't tell the difference between friend or enemy. Do you know those moments in a film that conclusively consolidate your suspicion of watching a cinematic masterpiece? Well, in this film it happened again. With several scenes that impressed me there's this one scene rather in the end where Tony shoots Manny after finding out he had a sexual encounter with his sister, only to find out that they got married a day before. Pacino's reaction after realising that he made a severe mistake, his heart breaking in the matter of seconds, the way the hate immediately leaves his face and makes way for regret was this one breathtaking scene. That's how I also come to another thing that fascinated me deeply, a single character trait that actually contradicts his general personality: Family. Even though it's depicted that he would do anything to keep his position of power, there's this strange sense for family that makes him vulnerable. Next to the way he cares about his sister Gina, there is this one specific scene where he prevents the innocent wife and children of a target person from being killed, aware of the fact that this will lead to his own death. The ruthless gangster boss gives up everything he has achieved for ... family? This is exactly what makes this character even more fascinating and saves the last bit of humanity in him. Nonetheless, he receives his legitimate punishment for his extreme cockiness, in a scene that's iconic as it is powerfully symbolic. Montana who indirectly declared himself a god-king is ultimately reminded by his own mortality and all the mistakes he's made that lead to his inevitable fall, his death being the only logical consequence and price to pay for his acts. All in all, this gangster drama is a masterful character study about a man and the way he parishes by increasing power and the unquenchable thirst for money, the way he treated all the people on the way and how he eventually faces the consequences. Pacino delivered an outstanding performance and almost singlehandedly made this film a huge success, as he made the antihero of this compelling crime drama come to life effortlessly. Sophisticated, extremely entertaining and with sheer brilliance in acting and writing, this film absolutely impressed me and it feels like it will have a bigger impact on me than I expected. Shame on me that I have not watched it earlier and the fact that I only own it on DVD. The next time I see it on sale, I will upgrade it without thinking too much. That is what I owe this masterpiece.",Scarface
187,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Unforgettable,Epic And Stylish Gangster Classic From Brian De Palma With A Brilliant Performance From Al Pacino.",10,20 November 2013,"Scarface is an excellent,unforgettable and stylish epic Gangster film that combines amazing direction,a brilliant,iconic performance by Al Pacino as well as great performances from the rest of the cast,a terrific script and a great score and soundtrack. All of those elements make Scarface not only a Gangster classic,but also a Cult classic and a amazing remake that is Brian De Palma and Al Pacino at their best.Set in Miami,Florida in the early 1980s,Scarface tells the story of Tony Montana(Al Pacino),a Cuban immigrant who has arrived in the United States wanting success and the pursuit of the American dream. While in the city of Miami,Tony joins a drug cartel rising in the ranks and becoming one of the top suppliers of Cocaine while gaining money and power. Although successful and wealthy,Tony starts using his own coke supply and starts becoming paranoid,erratic and out of control leading to Tony's downfall for himself and the people around him.Released in 1983,Scarface while a modest success at the Box Office was panned by nearly every major critic in America at the time because of the film's Graphic Violence and excessive language. But since it's 1983 release Scarface has become a Cult Film and one of the most iconic films of all time with Scarface and Tony Montana becoming icons in not just pop culture but also Hip-Hop culture where Hip-Hop and Rap artists truly worship the film. Scarface is one of the all time great epic Gangster movies and is an amazing film on so many levels because what director Brian De Palma does is take Howard Hawks' original Gangster Classic Scarface(1932)and takes it from the world of Prohibition in the 1920s to the world drug infested world of early 1980s Miami,Florida pulling viewers into a world that is filled with excess and money with over the top style and brilliance that keeps you glued to the screen even though the world of Scarface is dangerous and violent. Scarface is also a film about the pursuit of the American Dream but the American Dream is done in a flashy style with the main characters surround by drugs,money and death in this film with the American Dream told in a dark tale of tragedy,violence and downfall. Brian De Palma tricks viewers by showing the glitz and glamor of the Gangster and drug world of Scarface but then shows viewers how vicious and dark the drug world really is. At it's core Scarface is a morality tale told a Shakespeare way about the choices a person can make in life and how it can affect not only yourself but others as well and it definitely applies to Tony Montana. Tony Montana is one of the greatest and most iconic characters is movie history and a character who's been imitated and quoted throughout pop culture and is also a classic antihero who wants the world and everything in it no matter what. Tony is a complex character who we like not because of the things that he does but because of who he is because Tony has his own rules and codes that he lives by and never breaking them. We also see two different sides of Tony before and after his success which shows us his rise and fall. Before his success,Tony's head is on straight and he's more optimistic on the rise but as Tony becomes more successful with money and power Tony becomes more paranoid and distrusting with not only himself but with the people around him which leads to his unfortunate fall acting like a bomb about to go off. The rise and fall of Tony Montana is one of the most compelling and tragic rise and fall tales you will ever see on film. The violence in Scarface is Graphic,shocking and will disturb viewers because of it's darkness and brutality but I think the violence had to be in the film because it shows how dangerous and harsh the drug world can be. The screenplay by Oliver Stone is amazing and memorable with so many great lines and lots of F-bombs. Some of the dialog by Stone has become so iconic and unforgettable and are staples in pop culture especially the film's most famous line that comes at the end. The ending of Scarface is easily one of the greatest endings I have ever seen on film because there is thrills,great lines,violence and surprises adding to the legend of Scarface and Tony Montana. An amazing conclusion to a great film.The whole cast is terrific. Al Pacino is excellent,iconic and at his best as Tony Montana,with Pacino being intense,over the top and unforgettable. Amazing performance by Pacino. Steven Bauer is fantastic as Manny,Tony's best friend and right hand man. Michelle Pheiffer is amazing and sexy as Elvira,Frank's girlfriend and Tony's love interest. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is terrific as Gina Montana,Tony's sister. Robert Loggia is outstanding and memorable as Frank Lopez,Tony's boss. F.Murray Abraham is wonderful as Omar,an employee of Frank's. Paul Shener is sensational as Sosa,a business partner of Tony's. Harris Yulan is wonderful as Mel Bernstein,a corrupt cop. Miriam Colem is captivating as Mama Montana,Tony and Gina's Mother.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera with close-ups,zoom ins bringing his signature style to the film. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Giorgio Moroder is amazing,memorable and matches the film's tone. Fantastic score,Moroder. The film also has wonderful soundtrack with songs by Paul Engemann(Push It To The Limit),Deborah Harry(Rush Rush),Amy Holland(She's On Fire,Turn Out The Night),Elizabeth Daily(Shake It Up,I'm Hot Tonight),Beth Andersen(Dance,Dance,Dance),Maria Conchita Alonso(Vamos a Bailar)and Frank Sinatra(Strangers In The Night). Incredible soundtrack.In final word,if you love Gangster Films,Cult Films,Brian De Palma,Al Pacino or movies in general,I highly suggest you watch Scarface,an excellent,unforgettable epic Gangster Classic that is Brian De Palma and Al Pacino at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Scarface
188,jackasstrange,"Voracious and extremely over the top, yet manages to be an intelligent film",9,27 December 2013,"Not a big fan of Brian DePalma, but this one just blew me away. He did one of the worst homages i've seen for Psycho with his horrible 'Dressed to Kill' in 1980, but that one, Scarface, compensates every mediocre moment i had to pass through the aforementioned film. Scarface, hated by some and loved by others in the 80s for being utterly violent and for being the most controversial and shocking film produced in Hollywood to the date, divided critics, the audience and even the people who works doing films. While the director Martin Scorsese said 'I love it', the actor Dustin Hoffman said 'I fell asleep' and the division went for a long while. Obviously all the hate for it being so 'over the top' passed, because every year since then there is a film with even more profanities, violence and drug use coming out. But yeah, it still shocking. The only reason it is not worth a NC- 17 is because some effects actually looks very cheap and fake, so it inevitably affects the impact of the film over nowadays viewers. But again, the overuse of profanities will upset those who are easily offended.This film is, after all, a reflexion about what ambition can brings, but it's not a moralist tale at all, and despite being over the top, it's possible to see a bit of truth on it.Al Pacino is superb as Tony Montana. The impulsive and totally unpredictable crazy drug- dealer. I simply loved him in that role. I also found interesting the editing and art direction. Some strong contrasts, specifically in the 'hot colors' (red,orange), used remarkably in a bright white ambient. Interesting choice. The cinematography looks very campy. The zoom in the 'Party Scene' was almost amateur. But i didn't have major problems with it, and neither with the 80s typical beats that were played constantly.Watch this film. 9.2/10",Scarface
189,zeekwunlau,What is the peace that the gang seeks?,8,1 May 2020,"Al Pacino is a good actor, this is undoubtedly, but in this movie, I feel a little bit, I did not know where I saw a sentence before, saying that the real Italian gangster does not agree with Al Pacino From the point of view of acting, I am also a layman. I just feel that the self-expression in the film is a bit awkward. It may be related to the role, but not to the acting skills. The Cuban gangster is not the Italian gangster. I think another gangster actor is very natural and unintentional. By the way, when Al Pacino killed the boss, the last younger brother asked if he needed work. The actor's performance, the expression was really too good, and one thought that he was going to die, and then not only died but also got a job, that kind of sad feeling made people funny and sympatheticCuba 's exile of so many prisoners and refugees to the United States was heard in Luo Ji thinking before. I think every major event in history can make a movie, and it 's a different angle, such as this Department, in fact, he did not focus on describing this event, but put it in a specific personal perspective. I think he can be not Cuban, Colombian, Italian or other. Such a movie allows our audience to From the perspective of a gangster, if a person chooses to commit crime, what will his future be, and what will his life experience? When I first started watching, I was particularly worried about him. I was afraid that he would be caught by the police and afraid that he would not be able to move on. After seeing it, I realized that in fact, the director still has private goods. The criminal 's life will not have a good result. No matter what he has, his heart can never be calm, even if it can be superficial, maybe they will say something Moral conscience? Let 's go to hell, I just want to enjoy the moment, all I want is money, but when he sees his wife and children sitting in a bomb-loaded car, when he sees his brother who is close to him, and his sister, He will definitely understand that he is a gangster, he cannot do things without a lower limit, and he must not let his bloody hands touch his purest person.As a gangster movie, I saw the shadow of Martin Scorsese. The film was almost three hours long. There were no prominent villains or distinctive decents. Some were just cruel reality. Most of the time Alpacino was always one. In the image of paranoid, he will never be satisfied and never trust. What is he pursuing? I think the life he wants to pursue will never be possible, because he has embarked on a path of no return, he has no chance to choose a different life, so when he sees his sister walking into the ballroom, it must be very Sad, so when my mother scolded him, he accepted it all. Although he was angry, he didn't retreat. The director beat the audience from the side. Don't think that the dark spots are cool, don't think you are invincible, let alone do A bad guy, finally Al Pacino fell in the pool of blood. I think that moment is the tranquility he is after.",Scarface
190,OMTR,The Teachings Of Mama Montana,10,30 June 2019,"When you raise kids, you notice that the most critical issues do not lie with education, but within the influence of the community. Mama Montana is an admirable mother who has Values, Principles and Ideals and fights for them. She is an honest worker and her teaching about ugly money that stinks is the best kind of education parents can give to their children:
""Mama Montana: Son? I wish I had one! He's a bum! He was a bum then and he's a bum now! Who do you think you are, hm? We haven't heard a word from you in five years. Cinco anos. You suddenly show up here and you throw money at us? You think you can *buy* me with your money?

191,TheHonestCritic,This is a another one of those rare remakes that's better than the original film. How does it hold up today?,10,3 May 2021,"""Scarface"" (1983), the original movie from 1932 really helped pave the way for crime and gangster films we know today. As much as I enjoy the original movie, the remake is superior and elevates the concept of the story to the next level. Also, it happens to be one of my top ten all-time favorite crime/gangster films! It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and also a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is similar to the original film with a few minor changes. In this film, our main character is named Tony Montana, instead of Tony Camonte. The story takes place in Miami instead of Chicago. Also, the plot in this film is heavily focused on drugs. All of those aspects add a stronger layer to the story and add more complexities to the plot itself. I remember when I first saw this movie, I didn't know how long it was. Once it begun, I was fully invested from beginning to end. Then, I looked at the clock and noticed that nearly three hours had gone by! I thought to myself: ""that was three hours? Wow, it didn't even feel like two!"" That's the sign of brilliant storytelling. When a long film goes by fast, then you know it's a winner! Plus, it has one of my top ten favorite lines in all of cinema, which is: ""say hello to my little friend!"" It's so good, that you can still hear it being quoted today! People say it in real life, plus, characters in movies and TV shows have said it on numerous occasions. I don't know if that was the script writer's intention, but he has written a brilliant line. Props to you, Oliver Stone! I don't want to go into any more details about the story, because I don't want to spoil anything. But, let me assure you, it's one that you'll never forget as long as you live. As far as the acting goes, it's equally as phenomenal as the storyline itself. But, of course the shining star in this movie has got to be Al Pacino as Tony Montana. With any movie he stars in, Al Pacino never disappoints, no matter how prominent his characters are. But, his performance here, in my opinion, is one of his absolute best! Another thing I like about his portrayal is that he is not cowardly like Tony Camonte in the original film. Now, hear me out, Tony Camonte was not a coward throughout the whole movie. His fear came out near the end. However, Tony Montana showed no fear and stayed strong all the way to the end and went out like a real man that never ever backed down. That just makes him a better and stronger character than the one in the original movie. Another thing, he really nails the Cuban accent. Usually, I don't like it when an actor or actress plays a character with a different accent from their real-life one. When that happens, their attempt at the accent is either too over the top, not believable enough or they don't even try. If I were a casting agent, I would try and find an actor or actress from that country with the accent that the character is supposed to have. Think about it, now this is an example, if the character in the film you're going to make is, let's say German. (I'm just making a point here). You wouldn't hire an actor that isn't German. If you cast actors or actresses who are actually from whatever country, then their accents would be authentic. Unless your actor can nail whatever accent they're doing, you should cast someone of that nationality. However, in the case of this movie, Al Pacino does an excellent job with the Cuban accent. If you didn't know that he was Italian-American, then you would honestly believe he was from Cuba! Give the dialect coach and Al Pacino an award! As for the rest of the cast, they're just as outstanding with their acting performances. The chemistry between the whole cast is impeccable and definitely shines on the screen. All of the sets/locations are stunning and give the film a beautiful atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are all well-done and still hold up today. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Giorgio Moroder is perfect and it really helps bring the movie to life! The film score sets the tone immediately and elevates the emotion of the story even further. Some people might say it's cheesy and overblown, but, for a plot like this, a soundtrack like that is warranted and it helps to tie everything together. ""Scarface"" is a triumph in the field of crime/gangster movies. Like I mentioned before, it's one of those rare remakes that's even better than the original. I'm giving this film 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Scarface"" yet, go and see it today. Or else, Tony Montana might hunt you down!",Scarface
192,GeorgeRoots,Brian De Palma's Finest Work As A Director.,9,8 August 2014,"""Scarface"" is probably the finest contemporary gangster movie of it's time. It's relevance continues to bombard today through it's imagery, and the story has gone on to influence many musician's of the ""Def Jam Records"" label. Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay, Brian De Palma directs and Al Pacino shines in this rag's to rich's story. Based on the original 1932 classic ""Scarface: The Shame of the Nation"".In 1980, Cuban Refugee Tony Montana (Al Pachino) arrives in Miami. After working various low cuff jobs, the short tempered Tony immediately throws himself into the underworld of the Miami drug trade. His initial outcomes are disastrous, yet end with considerable results. Eventually like anyone in that line of work, a hit is put out on him. After wrapping up that nuisance he slowly ascends the ladder from street level dealer, to running a multi-million dollar drug empire. After he eventually manages to isolate himself from everyone (Even his closest friends and family), fellow drug lord Sosa (Paul Shenar) sends his men to Tony's mansion, culminating in a stunning finale of a shootout. Sounds a little like ""Citizen Kane"" to me, minus the cocaine and guns. Every time I watch the movie, I fall a little more in love with it. It captures the intensity of the drug trade, and the montages are undeniably a staple of many imitations. Tony Montana is certainly one of the best mobsters ever put on film. Regardless how unlikable he becomes, Al Pacino delivers a very engaging performance that sees an individual go up and down a ladder that depending on your sensibilities, isn't really worth climbing. The only negative I think it has is it's running length. For as many scenes they have (Which are fantastic), some just do not hold up to the pacing the movie set itself and feel needlessly drawn out.Final Verdict: When all is said and done, it's just very unforgettable. The night club, torture and shoot out scenes make for very intensive, but highly influential stuff. 9/10.",Scarface
193,jldmp1,Forbidden Mirrors,8,17 July 2006,"What strikes the viewer is the notable lack of theft of ideas from movie predecessors. I spotted the ""Foreign Correspondent"" borrowing when the Columbian gets it between the eyes from Pacino. And the Babylon mirrors resemble those from ""Enter the Dragon"". But that's about it -- the rest is devoted to piling on its own style. Stone assiduously avoided rewriting this just like Hawks' original, saying in interviews that, in its old form, it offered very little. So he wrote this as part exploration of the cocaine-fueled underworld, part catharsis to end his own dependence. Montana's death is heavy on the layered symbolism.The structure of the story is also 'mirrored' in the club mirrors -- each plot segment overlaps with the next one in some way; before the narrative completely moves out of one idea, the next one is reflected in.What makes this fly though is DePalma. We have almost relentless use of long, panning crane shots here. The perspectives are impossible for a human, so the camera does the acting -- typified in the aversion to the chainsaw scene. The effect is that of a painting, much like the sunset murals put up by the set designers all over 'Miami' (mostly L.A.). Lots and lots of bright, excessive colors and personalities.Pacino plays this as a mixture of Bogart/Cagney/Muni plus his own Godfather II-derived Michael Corleone...in other words, as a tyrant. He would mine this for much of his later work (including Godfather III). In fact, when he tries to avoid tapping the Montana character, he comes across as lethargic (""Sea of Love"", ""Insomnia"").Also remarkable for the time was how the south Florida community reacted to the knowledge that the film production was underway, and forced the relocation of this to the west coast, because of the implied negative depiction of Cuban ex-pats. Probably, the only other movie that had this much unfavorable advance press is ""Basic Instinct"".",Scarface
194,Brian-272,Tony Montana wanted and conquered the American Dream but with a vengeance.,6,3 June 2001,"Scarface is another one of those classic movies we all have come to enjoy. When I first saw Scarface with my uncle and aunt about a year and a half ago I enjoyed it but still it was a disappointment. Scarface is good but still you find many other organized crime movies that are better. I must hand praise to Brian De Palma who did a terrific job with this work, plus this ranks as one of the better performances from Al Pacino. Pacino is nearly great as Cuban refugee Tony Montana who emigrates to Miami, Florida to make a fortune in the underworld of organized crime as he goes to the top of his game with a vengeance. I must say this about Scarface if you enjoy much cursing and the blood and guts violence then this is a film for you. I remember the chain saw scene in the motel now that was gore! Yet this is organized crime in Miami, Florida during the 80's so the film was certainly correct with it's demonstration of violence. The performance by Steven Bauer is also worth a notice. Scarface is a great film that shows how success of the underworld goes, this is one of the better films associated with Al Pacino a great film to rent and watch if you haven't.",Scarface
195,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Gangster's Damnation,9,9 May 2020,"Al Pacino absolutely steals the show in this high-charged and gratuitous crime film, written by Oliver Stone a few years before his masterpiece ""Platoon"", and directed by Brian de Palma. I find it fascinating how the film manages to be a glamourous depiction of a gangster's rise to power and riches and also an extremely anti-gangster movie, showing his disillusionment when at the top wondering if this is really the life he had in mind while chasing his twisted version of the American Dream - epitomised in one scene by the subliminal messaging on a blimp flying overhead, ""The World Is Yours"". Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is a Cuban refugee who arrives in Miami and ends up in a camp under a freeway, before carrying out a hit for a mobster and getting his green-card. After some wheeling and dealing and a couple of jobs, along with his best friend Manny (Steven Bauer), Montana, ruthless and extremely street-smart, sees his opportunity to take-over the cocaine drug in Miami and wipes out any and all opposition. He becomes the top-dog, but inevitably, and thanks to his erratic temper and personality, it won't be long before someone tries to take him down. Al Pacino is brilliant to watch here. Some think his performance is over-the-top but I personally think it's superb and think he was completely in charge of it. Stone's screenplay, like his screenplay for ""Platoon"" would later be, is harsh, full of sharp, natural and uncompromising dialogue. De Palma took this and chose to make it a glamourous depiction of the gangster's lifestyle, with bright-lightning, the uncanny background painting in the office of the palm trees and sunsets - a perfect allegory, really, for the life Montana is striving for - accompanied by a superb, pulsating score. It's interesting that he done it this way, because Stone's script was neutral in that a director could have made it very grim and with an unrelenting dark atmosphere all through if they'd seen fit. That's how versatile Stone's writing is here. De Palma does a wonderful job because the film, and Montana, goes out with a serious bang. The ending is as flashy, gratuitous and relentless as Pacino's galvanising performance.",Scarface
196,Eternality,"Scarface has somewhat become a cult classic over the years, but truth be told, it is a pretentious film.",6,14 July 2010,"Scarface is Brian De Palma's loose remake of the classic gangster picture of the same name by Howard Hawks. Instead of Chicago in which the latter is set, De Palma's film is set in Miami, giving it a timely relevance during the early eighties. During that time, there was an influx of illegal immigrants (many of them Cubans) into America, especially into Miami. Tony Montana is one of them, a fictional character created by screenwriter Oliver Stone (the Oscar-winning director of Platoon (1986) and JFK (1991)).Scarface follows Montana (Al Pacino) as he rises to power to become one of the country's most wealthiest and ruthless gangsters. He makes money through a lucrative business in drugs. Not surprisingly, he snorts cocaine himself. He is greedy, arrogant, and lusts over his boss' girl, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). In the middle of his huge mansion, there lies a sculpture with a ball on top with the words ""The World Is Yours"" emblazoned.The irony of those words are laid out in bare in the final sequence, perhaps Scarface's most (notoriously) famous one – a bloody shootout in which Montana wields a huge weapon and attempts to gun down intruders to his house. De Palma's film is very violent, and in an early scene, a chainsaw is used to torture a victim. This scene shows the director at his skillful best, using quick editing and indirect framing to suggest the gruesomeness of the act rather than through direct means. This makes it so much more stomach-churning.Scarface has somewhat become a cult classic over the years, but truth be told, it is a pretentious film. It is, in my opinion, a B-grade gangster picture dressed up as an Oscar contender. It is a campy experience, does not take itself seriously (to its detriment), and will probably get worse on subsequent viewings. The electronic score by Giorgio Moroder is absolutely appalling; it is dull, lacking in substance, and is a mismatch for a film with such a heavy subject matter.Al Pacino's performance is bad in a good way. He puts on a Cuban accent and exaggerates his acting that it becomes unintentionally funny. Montana turns into a caricature of sorts, like a cartoon character in an animated comedy. One could praise Pacino for elevating a sub-par film to something borderline watchable. Because De Palma has (wrongly) opted for a campy style, it is only wise for Pacino to take his acting in that direction too.While Scarface gives some insights into the lifestyle of the drug underworld, one feels that it may not be as definitive as Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), the greatest picture of its genre, and many times more compulsively rewatchable. De Palma is talented but he is not a great filmmaker. He is way too inconsistent and his films do not often connect with viewers. Scarface would have been a failure if not for Stone's intense screenplay and Pacino's ""cartoonish"" performance. Montana is unforgettable, but Scarface is not.SCORE: 6/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",Scarface

198,Thrashman88,"Good, but no classic!",6,20 April 2008,"Having seen SCARFACE last night after a 22 year gap I can honestly say that I was entertained, but have to admit that the movie is nowhere near other gangster classics such as (ironically) THE GODFATHER or GOODFELLAS. SCARFACE tells the tale of Cuban ""political"" immigrant Tony Montana and his arrival to the U.S. and how he attains money and power beyond his wildest dreams. You don't need to be a narc or an FBI expert to tell that Montana smells of bad luck; his demeanor, the way he talks, etc. would make him an instant suspect in any police department around the world. How he manages the get IN the U.S. is one of the movie's first flaws. It was apparent from the start that Montana was a lowlife and trouble maker. His manners and ways don't change through out the entire film. It's as though we're almost looking at a comic book character. Many people hailed Pacino's performance but I found it terribly annoying, one-dimensional. Forget if he's a nihilistic punk. His character barely shows anything different than the punk he is. Except on one scene, where he is forced to kill a person along with his family. It's the only point in the whole movie where he shows some remorse and/or compassion for someone else. The other characters, like Elvira (Michelle Pfeifer) are equally wasted in their performances. How come she ends up marrying the ""grease ball"" she so much hates? If anyone, only Steven Bauer's character was a tad more human and believable. As for the action sequences, they are far less bloody than anything on THE GODFATHER or GOODFELLAS. Sure, there's a lot of cursing, courtesy of Scarface himself. Another thing that annoyed me is that I'm never quite sure how LONG it took Tony Montana to be from Cuban Lowlife to Mr. American dream. The movie never addresses this. Instead of including useless scenes of Tony and his Bank administrator or Tony and Manny checking out the chicks at Miami Beach, more character development would've been much welcomed.SCARFACE plays more like an exploitation film, done with Hollywood standards, but in that sense it wasn't shocking to me when I saw it 22 years ago and it wasn't shocking to me last night. Sure, I like Pacino, Brian De Palma and Oliver Stone and sure, I think SCARFACE is OK, but a TOP 250 IMDb movie??? Like Tony Montana would say, ""Gimme a f#%!g break"" !!!",Scarface
199,ssssgelojun,Scarface,9,13 August 2020,"It is a classic gangster movie. It perfectly presents the crime and drug ridden southern US city Miami in the 1980s, interprets the American dream in the 1980s, and tells the story of Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee with ambitions beyond his dreams. Step by step, Tony Montana goes from street gangster to tycoon, to drug addict and finally brings a life of killing. I think the film's biggest bright spot is that the average movie like to keep leading role from mixed to the top step by step, hand day, of course, the first half of scarface, also is such, when Tony got a woman money power, the story should have a perfect end, but in fact is immediately as parabola, after the culmination of diminishing, Tony began to distrust, even your best friend Manny, then because the drug is more and more degenerate, finally lost woman lost friends, and even life.Never get high on your own supply. When your ambitions exceed your reality, the American dream can turn into a nightmare. And remember, never touch drugs. Drugs are the biggest factor that can make a person lose everything.He ended up carrying so many guns because of an overdose of drugs and a self-destructive impulse to blame himself, one of the most powerful moments in a gangster movie.",Scarface
200,werefox08,Face it....the Scar runs deep,9,7 March 2012,"An unpretentious, movie about a Cuban immigrant who only wants the world...(a bit greedy). This is a great performance by Al Pacino, who plays Tony Montana a character who has a totally nihilistic personality...and a sick crush on his beautiful sister. He knows the angles ..and is not stupid...but he has not got an ounce of class. Brian De Palma directs this in an unusual way..sometimes hitting the bullseye...then he has a scene that lacks class. The music in Scarface is extremely cheesy. But it fits. Oliver Stones script is also uneven...often intuitive or funny...then a few minutes of low class writing. It is strange how the main characters lack of class works perfectly with the dips in direction and writing. The end of Scarface is Way Over The Top---but it works . Tony has a huge pile of coke on his desk--he takes one inch high lines !! His face becomes like a snowman. The shoot out is ""cartoonish""....but that too works. Scarface has become a cult movie. I love its whole ""in your face"" ""take it or leave it"" style. An exceptional motion picture.",Scarface
201,nicolechan916,Great acting with interesting portrayals.,8,27 September 2015,"There is a lot of action in the film, and quite a few gory scenes which are gory enough for me to turn my head away. Considering the subject matter however, there was not as much violence as I thought there would be. What makes this movie stand out for me, is that there is structure which follows Montana's rise to success as a drug lord and when there is violence, the violence is explained. I wouldn't say that the violence is justified, but unlike many other action films nowadays with pointless fighting, this film doesn't have that. The acting in the film is pretty great. Al Pacino does a marvelous job at playing Tony Montana. His gradual character change from 'fun bobby' to intense, paranoid, control freak is done so subtly that it is hard to believe he is in character. Steven Bauer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio are great in their roles too. Michelle Pfeiffer's character did not have much emotion, as she was probably stoned all the time, so I guess Pfeiffer did well in her role too. This film perfectly depicts the American dream, as Tony proves with hard work (and crime activity), you can come from the bottom and reach the top. However the film also criticizes capitalism, through the rise and fall of Tony. There is no such thing as having enough, and once greed takes over, an unhappy ending is pretty much guaranteed. There is also a great deal many things that I find confusing (for example, his relationship with his sister), and that I dislike (the portrayal of women), but overall it was quite an engaging film.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",Scarface
202,williampsamuel,A Masterpiece of Melodrama and Ultraviolence,10,15 January 2015,"""Say hello to my little friend!"" These were the most famous words of Antonio 'Tony' Montana, a man who lived faster and harder than any other. He never backed down, never took anything from anyone, and broke every rule in the business. His ambition and his greed knew no bounds. Through cunning, ruthlessness, and sheer ballsiness, he shot straight to the top, and went out guns blazing. He got everything that was coming to him and more, but he destroyed everything he came into contact with, including himself. Scarface is his story, and it is magnificent.Al Pacino and director Brian DePalma have truly created one of the most arrogant, vulgar, irredeemable, mutha****s ever to appear on screen. Tony Montana is a man with no conscience, no morals, and no respect for anyone or anything. All that matters to him is what he wants, and how he can get it. He has one of the most explosive tempers I've seen since Raging Bull, and expresses himself mainly through the F-word. I lost count of his F-bombs somewhere after 100, and that was in the first 40 minutes. He's complete loose cannon, a guy who can't make peace or take orders.But watching his life unfold, revulsion gives way to pity. Yes, pity. Because even though achieves wealth and power beyond his dreams, he never finds happiness. Part of it is that he never allowed himself to be satisfied, never learned to enjoy what he had. His first boss, Frank Lopez, may have been a sleazy double-crossing jerk, but he knew a good thing when he found it. It didn't matter that his operation didn't extend beyond South Florida; he already had enough money that the hard part was finding ways to spend it. He lived the high life, and he loved it.But not Tony. No matter how much he had, it wasn't enough. There were new territories to conquer, new assets to acquire, and if he stopped to relax he'd fall behind. As far as he was concerned, the world and everything in were coming to him. But even when he had the millions, the mansion, and the biggest distribution system on the east coast, it still wasn't enough. ""Is this it?"" he asked his friend Manny, ""Is this what we worked so hard for?"" And deeper than that, Tony simply couldn't relate to or connect his fellow human beings. He had a trophy wife, family, and friends who'd been with him since he was a street hood in Cuba. But he drove away or turned on every one of them. Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) was the love of his life, the woman he knew he had to have as his bride. But once he did there was nothing but bickering, short-lived passion, and cocaine. She'd have been better off if she'd stayed with Frank.And there's his sister Nina. He will do anything to protect her, to point of obsession. No man is good enough for his sister, and so no man will have her. And when he finds her with Manny, his oldest friend and trusted lieutenant, Tony shoots him without even a word. In one instant, with one bullet, he destroys the two most important relationships in his life. Really Tony only loved two things: himself, and the nose candy. Seeing him towards the end, he's like a violent, drug addicted Charles Foster Caine, except that guy died of natural causes.Not that this is meant as a cerebral biopic. Scarface is one of the most graphic films of the 80's. There are knifings, hangings, a brutal killing with a chainsaw- thankfully off screen- and shootings galore, including the final battle royal at Tony's mansion. This is one of the bloodiest, most powerful shootouts in the annals of cinema. The moments leading up to it are incredible enough, and then comes an absolutely stunning climax of blood and bullets that will completely blow you away. Terentino and Scorsese would be hard pressed to improve on these final moments. If you're even a bit squeamish, stay away. But if you have an extremely high tolerance for language and violence, then by all means see Scarface.",Scarface

204,stormhawk2021,One of the crime movies for all times,10,11 June 2017,"""Scarface"" is one of those must see films that everyone who loves crime thrillers needs to see, if only for the intense character portrait of crime. This three hour gore fest tells the tale of Cuban refugee Tony Montana, who rises through the ranks of a crime syndicate until he is the reigning king of the drug scene in eighties' Miami. What fascinates viewers is the fragility of the organization, and how fraught with violence the film is, initially putting a lot of people off. Tony only gets as far as he does because he trusts no one, is only out for himself, and revels in the blood and cocaine madness of his empire. While he comes to the United States bedraggled and full of vinegar, he slowly morphs into an opportunistic henchman, happy to be seen as the working man, oblivious to the death and destruction of his actions, and jealous of everyone and everything that stands in his way. He is our protagonist but he is also our villain, so bloodthirsty and autonomous that it's pretty frightening to think he holds most of the power. Though Tony breaks down doors in order to become the king, he also steps on a lot of people to get there, so it's obvious that his world will crumble around him quickly. The casting is perfect for this film. Pacino portrays an embittered, hate-filled Montagna, which makes for a volatile performance. Michelle Pfeiffer stars as the prize that he longs to grasp within his claws, while being both frigidly cold and hopelessly angry, making for a great dynamic between the two characters. Besides this film being great in its realistic depiction of a drug enterprise, it's also a great crime film. The seventies and eighties were rife with stories of kingpins and gangsters, but this is the first that shows the arrogance and self-indulgence of cocaine, and its place in real life 1980s Miami. This film both demonizes the exploits of its lead while also showing the extravagance that crime comes with, and that's an intense balance to find. Brian de Palma masters this balance by showing the motivations of the character, and the lengths he is willing to go to find success in his adopted country. That's why this film stands the test of time, and illustrates the grandiosity of the drug trade in full.",Scarface

It's tough to get through the scenes he's in with that stupid laugh and unconvincing role he butchers. And F. Murray what's his name is equally horrendous. This was the worst casting I've ever seen, and the soundtrack will make you retch if you can't find the mute button fast enough. Pacino, who has talent, displays none of it here. Just a ridiculous over the top bad accent job. It's all just so cliche and contrived. His overprotective bit towards his sister is particularly grating. A few good scenes but not the ones you're thinking of. I liked one involving a helicopter and rope. One with a hotel bathroom. Otherwise a few cool classic cars had the most shine in this pathetic romp. Michelle P.

Running long (but never boring) at 2:50, the high production values of this film really make it stand out.  Every penny put into this movie is evident on screen.  Oliver Stone's screenplay is first-rate, and this is some of Al Pacino's best acting.  Michelle Pfeiffer puts in an outstanding performance as well as ""Elvira Hancock,"" Tony Montana's wife.  I can't pinpoint a single actor in this movie who gets it wrong.  Brian De Palma's directing is superb throughout the film.It should be pointed out that there are scenes in this movie absolutely not suitable for younger viewers.  Even accompanied by a parent, I would not bring along your 12-year-old to see this picture.  The violence is so intense at some points that it's a miracle the picture escaped the ""NC-17"" rating.  Actual sexual content is minimal.  This is one of the most violent pictures I've ever seen, perhaps THE most violent.Despite this, ""Scarface"" is an absolute must-see.

Scarface was met with mixed reviews and Pacino's performance was criticised as 'over the top'. I can see why many critics did not like Scarface: it's over the top, it's weak on the storyline, it's perhaps repetitive at times and it's 170 minutes long. Scarface is not a masterpiece, but it is an iconic film. It's entertaining, vivid and bloody.

209,illbebackreviews,Al Pacino delivers one of the greatest performances in what is one hell of an entertaining film,9,13 March 2013,"I am not one to believe in critics. I usually don't agree with them but I was very skeptical about seeing this movie due to such negativity I've heard stating that the movie is way too over the top, over acted, boring story line and very cheesy. So naturally, my expectations weren't very high for this movie I love Al Pacino as an actor, especially in the Godfather, where both he and Marlon Brando just owned the first and he stole the show in the second with Robert de Niro.The story of 'Scarface' focuses around a Cuban refugee by the name of Tony Montana, and much like Godfather, focuses on the rise and corruption to greed and power of this man.The acting in the movie was mainly great but Al Pacino's legendary performance and what I believe is, his greatest yet, was totally deserving of an Academy Award for both Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor! That's how amazing that performance was. Some of the dialogue in the movie is awful like 'Say Hello to My little friend!' but under Al Pacino's amazing portrayal, these sound like bits of Quentin Tarantino's gold dialogue! The movie is over the top! Yes! However, it is pretty aware of itself and such acts throughout the film indicate this very clearly such as Tony Montana saying ""I'm still standing"" and so on. That brings to a MAJOR SPOILER, SO DON'T READ THE REST OF THIS PARAGRAPH IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE! Tony Montana's death is one of the more disappointing conclusions to a movie I otherwise loved. I mean, the Mask comes up and just shoots him and he dies! I would've liked a bit of a duel before Tony was taken out. Also, the movie was quite predictable but I also just enjoyed it Critics have said the movie is slow paced and the last half of the movie isn't very good in comparison to the first half- I disagree. The movie for me, was paced perfectly and three hours went by quickly. The second half is the half I like more mainly due to the true corruption of Tony Montana. However, this movie did add two surprisingly touching scenes and I was surprised by it actually! The cinematography can be lazy and the music isn't a John Williams masterpiece or anything but is nevertheless, good. The directing in the movie, I thought was fantastic and paced brilliantly! Al Pacino's amazing performance is easily enough to say that even if the rest of the cast was awful, the overall acting in the movie would still be good In conclusion, 'Scarface' is a movie that has been heavily criticized by critics but in my opinion, isn't anything as bad as it has been said. I personally loved it and 3 hours went by far too quickly when dealing with my favorite Al Pacino performance! The final 45 minutes was full of tension and superbly made if only the final minute of the movie could've been better done",Scarface
210,TheHande,The definitive Crime Film trilogy...,9,30 August 2007,"The Godfather, Scarface and GoodFellas create the definitive trilogy of crime-films with each taking a different perspective into the lives of the criminals. Scarface is once again a story of how a criminal's rise and fall but decisively different and more larger than life than in other crime films.Scarface is a very psychological film as it effectively shows the breakdown of Tony Montana's character. The film is also possibly more dark than either Godfather or GoodFellas which is why it also stands on its own in the are of emotional drama. With all the darkness the comedy of the film luckily helps it to stand on its own and not become a barrage of gunfights and gore.The only possible criticism that could be directed at the film might be the over-all structure of the story which is surprisingly straight-forward. By the end you can pretty much tell what's gonna happen. As a consequence the ending may be something of a let down, but on the other hand the final scenes of the movie are also some of my favorites so it creates a bit of an odd mixture.Sure enough, Scarface is a film to be reckoned with and an excellent piece of cinema.",Scarface

Trivia and director interview, it was oliver. Stone writers, and it is when he was the most unappreciated, almost bankrupt become box office poison, depressed under the adaptation of the script, change after ya is very want to personally guide, but the management and the producer said what also dare not to him, but found a director of great box-office appeal -- -- -- -- -- you know, remaking old piece of how risky, but still so deeply rooted in a classic black and white, how difficult also, want to break through the difficulty is roughly equivalent to remake the 83 version of the legend of the condor heroes.I didn't see the old version of scarface, I just saw a few bits of it in the sideshow. It was a classic. There was a scene of picking up a girl, which many movies have copied.Female: ""he is your boss""
Man: ""I'm only interested in you right now.""I think when AL Pacino was young, he was very skilled in his performance, and it was a big breakthrough just because of the length and the spectacle.Behind every boss has a remarkable woman, the woman looks like eat soft rice, what matter son who actually, this woman is the most terrible, in ""once upon a time in America, we see how wheat, phase the coquettish beauty between the adept with their elder brother a few, and how to live to the end of the safe and sights. The rest of the people are all muddle-headed flapping street, she is still clear to understand alive, alive to tell the story of the magnificent brotherhood, the romantic love story.In this movie, too, scarface steals the boss's woman, who then walks away from him, leaving him to pounced on his gun-riddled luxury home.American movies, often intentionally or unintentionally reflect on their national pride themselves on the ""American Dream"" () of an American Dream, to outsiders is very beautiful very reasonable national traits, they repeated reflection, from Fitzgerald's novel to many many Hollywood movies, is to reflect on the question: a tycoon by tramp through their own efforts, a by our own wisdom become the mainstream of society, an implementation of a legendary American Dream, he, will, happiness? Should not, get happiness?In fact, we have already seen that the sad gatsby, who has never been confident all his life, is unhappy, and the great citizen Kane, who is still living a more empty and lonely life, can't even get to the end of his life on scarface, a Cuban stowaway.This kind of self-reflection and self-deprecation has always sold well and made people feel sorry for themselves, but never has an American declared that his values are being challenged, and that in the face of strong destiny and complex humanity, people should always be humble and low-key.

214,brianberta,This is an okay movie but it is pretty overrated,6,29 August 2015,"The Godfather, The Godfather Part 2, Pulp Fiction, and Goodfellas are usually called some of the greatest gangster films ever made. However, Scarface also gets a lot of praise from the audience and it is often compared to them and sometimes it is even considered to be the best film from the genre. I disagree.Tony Montana, a Cuban criminal, slowly takes over a drug cartel as he slowly succumbs to greed and eventually goes mad with power.Firstly, this movie does have its positives. Firstly, the acting is great. Al Pacino does a great performance here and his acting gets more unnerving as he gets more greedy as the film goes on. The other actors gave a good performance too but Al Pacino did the best job. It's not as groundbreaking as his performance in The Godfather Part 2 but it is still great on its own. The score is very memorable and fitting also.Also, the final 20 minutes are very well-done. It shows how Tony's fortunes and wealth begin to collapse in on itself and he finally gets what's coming to him. The gun battle at the end is masterfully done. It contains a very quotable line of dialogue and it is executed very well. And by the time the end result comes, it is certain to make your jaw drop. Also, the other couple shootout scenes are very stylized and well-done too.However, this is why I think that it isn't as good as other movies from the genre.The longer a movie is, the more likely it will run into pacing issues. Being 170 minutes long, Scarface does in fact have pacing issues and it doesn't have the same perfect pacing that The Godfather did. The issue with its pacing is that it takes a while for them to set up Tony's character and it also takes a while for his personality to change in the movie.Also, I found this movie to be very bland. Sure, it picks up in the last 20 minutes but there isn't a whole lot of action going on beforehand. I mentioned that this movie has pacing issues and those issues can often make it feel very boring. Not much exciting or interesting events go on in it. Several scenes should've been shortened or removed altogether.But despite what I said, this is not a bad movie. It does have its flaws but I'd say that it has a little more good things about it than there are bad things. This is entertaining if you don't mind bland movies and the slow-pacing. I just don't think that it's as good as other highly-praised movies (which I listed earlier) from the same genre.",Scarface
215,Alex-372,Pre-Miami Vice,8,21 August 2005,"Scarface came out one year before Miami Vice, and it is a very clear influence. The expensive suits, cars, the beautiful women, and especially the synth pop (by Giorgio Moroder in Scarface, Jan Hammer in Miami Vice) and obviously the subtropical Miami setting. I had never seen this movie in full, but it was great. It did seem odd to see so many now famous non-Cuban actors dressed up as Cubans, when there were so many Latino actors out there, even in 1983. Only Steven Bauer is the real deal. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was hot, which I never suspected. And Al Pacino can't dance to safe his life. Anyway, this is a very influential movie. The ending is predictable, and you have to wonder - doesn't anyone ever just retire and move into legitimate business?",Scarface

218,Ziya90,A misunderstood and very unappreciated film,10,4 November 2010,"Scarface is a very violent and bloody film? No, it is not, even in its time. There is a very famous chainsaw scene, of course there are killings and gunfights, but these do not make the movie so violent and bloody. Especially, if we live in 2000s when some movies with extreme violence and blood have been made. For the squeamish, Scarface might be pretty disturbing, but otherwise it is just as violent as a crime movie. Then, why do people call especially Scarface violent and bloody while Goodfellas or The Godfather are violent and bloody too? I don't know. Secondly, as I see, some hate Scarface because according to them, some people, especially wannabe youths imitate the character, Tony Montana. However, the question is does it make the movie awful? Then, let's put all the gangster movies including The Godfather into a basket and then burn it. Scarface is a masterfully directed, masterfully executed, masterfully acted and visually so stylish crime film by Brian De Palma. Scarface is a so stylish movie from the cinematography to the art direction. As for the script, I think it is Oliver Stone's one of the best works as writer (especially in terms of story editing in contrast with Heaven and Earth) I agree that the movie is shallow throughout, but not flawed even a moment. It is 170 minutes approx. so as it is understood, it is an epic! What is the advantage of the long duration then? We can see the life of Tony Montana, Scarface in detail which means satisfying. The movie or the characters are not deep at all, but personally, I did not even mind it while watching, because everything else was great? By the way, sorry, but why did you expect a deep character study? It is a crime epic and if Al Pacino is one of your all time favorite actors like me and if you like De Palma's style, then there is no possible way to dislike the movie. If you did, then congratulations, you are one of a kind. Personally, I like De Palma very much, for me, he has more than one masterpiece in his filmography like Body Double or Casualties of War and Scarface is one of them. Now, it is time to talk about Al Pacino. However, before that I want to say that this is a fast moving and ''event driven'' movie, not a character driven movie, but still Al Pacino is great in this movie and he gives a great performance. Tony Montana is not someone likable, because he is always angry, so angry and he trusts nobody, but Pacino makes him one of the most remarkable (and likable?) movie icons ever. Therefore, by Pacino, Scarface was a character who I hate and also like. And there is a gunfight sequence, one of the best parts of the movie for sure, it recalls John Woo movies and it is almost obvious that Brian De Palma was inspired by John Woo. We are talking about one of the best gunfight sequences ever. It was a 'edge of the seat' gunfight sequence and it does not happen often! so the importance of that sequence especially comes from that, but of course also it is impressive, stylish and entertaining, if entertainment is the right word in this case. Lastly, I have seen the original 1932 version and it was excellent too. Both movies are excellent in its own way. It was an early Warner Bros style gangster film and and this remake is one of the best movies of all time too.",Scarface

It went from a 10 to an 8 after about an hour and while it was okay, it seemed to be going nowhere and ended as a 7/10.10-8-7.So that's my rating for this film. I don't know how to describe it. It definitely won't stay with me for long and will be forgotten too soon. There's nothing so great about this movie and the 8.3 rating for it seems to high. The acting seems like that of a B-grade movie. Starts off as A grade but like I said, the movie loses steam and thus even the acting starts seeming hammy. I really love Pacino, but the screenplay is far from interesting to feel like he did a fine job as no actor is above the script and an actor can only be as good as the script. As someone said before, this is like a very cheesy, popcorn movie, which is not a bad thing but it also isn't true cinema. Wish it had a better written screenplay. This movie had so much potential but the end result sadly is an okay film.",Scarface
221,heisenberg12,"""Say Goodnight to the Bad Guy""- Pacino's greatest performance leads a star-studded cast to an 80's Masterpiece and crime classic",10,9 February 2019,"Pacino stars in his best acting performance, and what might be the best acting performance of all-time. He makes this film what it is by completely owning his character and the movie in every scene he is in. He is constantly poised and focused, the way he would need to be navigating the Miami drug scene with his ambition.Unlike other classics like Goodfellas and Heat, which rely on a strong ensemble of performances, Scarface is Al Pacino's movie. It's not to say that the supporting cast is not good; they certainly are, but Pacino dominates the screena nd carries the movie with his over-the-top, classic performance.""What's coming to you Tony?"" ""The world chico, and everything in it"", Pacino replies to his Cuban immigrant friend. This is a story of ambition, betrayal, ego, and greed. Montana's core is believable and relatable to anyone with ambition. It is understated how epic his climb from Cuban refugee to leader in the drug business is. The 2 hours and 50 minute run time sounds long, but you don't really notice it since the movie maneuvers through each of its Acts in a stylish, entertaining, and action-packed way.
Scarface may be off-putting and too cheesy for some first time viewers who are expecting to be hooked by action or more impressive cinematography. They may not relate to the rawness, darkness, and edginess of Tony's story, or the 80s vibe it has to it may not interest them at first. But if you put in the effort to accept this movie for what it is, which is an 80's gritty crime tale featuring what is arguably the best and most memorable performance of Pacino's career and you dive deeper into the themes of ambition, success, greed, ego, friendship, loyalty, and betrayal, you will understand what it's all about.Scarface isn't a shoot-em-up action thriller. It's a realistic story of one man's rise from rags to riches, from poverty to excessive wealth, from no power to all the power in the world, and the truths that exist once one arrives to the top in all its corruption, excess, and notoriety.This movie has high rewatch value due to memorable lines all over it that are easily quotable thanks to Pacino's dialogues and monologues. In the pinnacle of crime and gangster movies, Scarface is a must own and must see.

He had one more good movie up his sleeve a few years later, The Untouchables, but otherwise, he was pretty much on a downward spiral by the early 80s.
The acting is over the top, things just happen, but you don't feel anything for the lead character. He just goes forward. It feels sometimes like it just keeps jumping around, 3 months later, 3 months later, let's skip filling things in. And what was up with Robert Loggia's Lopez character and having only one bodyguard on his payroll?! When Tony Montana implied his boss was low key, he wasn't kidding.

But compared to the original, it is a disgrace. The original is the best gangster film of all time, and one of the best films of all time. It was a monumental work of art that made movie history. This one does little to stay true to the original, it completely changes everything. In fact it barely pays homage to it, to the point where it actually overwrote the original and caused it to be forgotten about, which is just a travesty, making it not so much a remake, but stealing.The original was so much better than this one, this one pales in comparison. The original is a classic work of art, this one is a vapid superficial action film. The original was about al capone. This one isn't about any historical gangster, just some cuban. The original was about prohibition during the roaring 20's. This one is about cocaine during the 80's. The original is about the art of film and the darkness of mafia culture. This one is about pop culture and how cool a badass gangster can be made to look.Now I am not saying that this is a bad film. I'm just trying to bring awareness to the fact that it is just a remake of one of the great classics which happens to be one of the best (the best in my opinion) films of all time.

An update of the 1932 film, Scarface (1983) follows gangster Tony Montana and his close friend Manny Ray from their trip on the Cuban Boat Lift for refugees to their arrival in Miami. After killing a powerful Cuban figure, Montana and company gain the ability to leave their refugee camps and roam around the U.S. After unsuccessfully trying to make it legitimately in the country, Montana and Ray resort to selling cocaine to dealers around the world. Tony's rise is quick, but as he becomes more powerful, his enemies and his own paranoia begin to plague his empire Before I go on with my review, let me just say that Al Pacino is one scary dude. I wouldn't be messing around with him because as he aptly said, ""You mess with me! You mess with the best!"". I mean, even to the last minutes of his colorful drug-induced life, he stood there and took the bullets like it was nothing. It was really looking to be the best, most badass way to die that is until some Terminator wannabe hack creeped behind him and loaded Tony with a 12 gauge shotgun. That scene along with the forever classic ""Say hello to my LITTLE FRIEND!"" was one of the most violent, visually amazing, bullet orgy I have ever seen in the history of cinema.Al Pacino gives off one of his best performance ever as Cuban immigrant Tony Montana. His intensity on screen was like an earthquake, it was amazingly well done. It is rather obvious that he was really committed to playing the character, undertaking lessons to make his Cuban accent more believable and I read in one article that even off screen, he was still using the accent. Hours and hours of painstaking work and dedication until he reaped the fruits of his labor. A tip of the hat to the cast and crew of Scarface for making an unforgettable film and showed us what it really takes to achieve that 'American Dream' back in the day.",Scarface

Al Pacino performance here really can not be explained in words, that is the highest level an actor can reach, no doubt about it, the biggest shock is that Al Pacino didn't even get nominated for an Oscar for this performance, what a shame.Although the movie is 170 minutes long, you never feel bored, it doesn't have a lot of action, most people presume that ''scarface'' is a gangster movie with constant shoot-outs and killings, it is not like that at all, except for the end. It focuses more on showing hardships and problematic situations and playing on emotions. Tony does not really take care of all of these problems very well, thanks to his hot temper, he often gets furious and goes daft, not helping the situation whatsoever, but that was the whole story, if not like that, Tony wouldn't have reached the pinnacle of the drug industry.A classic everybody should watch, movie has some of the greatest conversations ever, by the way.",Scarface

It's still probably seen that way today.  But I would imagine, to their disappointment, it has and continues to stand the test of time.  Scarface will never be on a Top 100 list, but it is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion.  The realism of Scarface, I could only guess, scared a lot of people away.  This realism, along with its no holds barred, uncensored nature, makes this film great in my eyes. Now, many people use this to write off Scarface as an irresponsible, misguided movie with a tasteless overabundance of blood, drugs, killing and cursing.  Those who can appreciate the grittiness of Scarface are who talk highly of it.  This is quite a departure for Brian DePalma as far as subject matter, but he handled it masterfully.  Al Pacino's performance of Tony Montana is rivaled by only a few in the history of film...he's so good in the role it's scary. The fact that so many celebrated actors like John Travolta & Kevin Spacey all do good impersonations of Tony Montana is a testament to the influence of Pacino's performance.  Pacino is so good that at times I can't believe that its actually him on screen.  Appreciate this movie for the influence it has on film.

232,Meltdown53098533,A different yet so remarkable piece of film making.,10,8 March 2003,"This movie has been pounded by bad reviews simply because it gave a new outlook on the criminal life. The performance by Al Pachino was a unique one in all the ways I see him. He swears, he kills, he does coke, so naturally we're suppose to hate him because he's obviously an anti hero. Yet if you have seen most of the really good mafia movies (Goodfellas, Casino, Reservoir Dogs ect.) you will find yourself routing for Pachino. He plays Tony Montona, a Cuban refugee who comes to America in hopes of one day to be the top of the cocaine empire. He finds his best friend Manny and together they go on a rocky road of violence, death, drugs and bullet shells. Of course this movie is DEFINATELY not for the squeamish because not only is there a sickening amount of language, but there was gore galore as well. Scarface was so violent, that when it came time to put it on video the film board ordered a scene to be almost cut entirely from the feature. It is rumored that the whole bloody scene will be put on the collector's edition DVD and I'm eager to buy that as soon as I see it. Yes Scarface is a different performance from Al Pachino, but if the right people see the movie, they will be left stunned. The violence, the drama, the surprisingly good and driving music. Watch this movie and see the story of two Cuban refugees who hit it big, and (much like the overall price of glory) ultimatly witness all their dreams implod on them.

Low-key, quiet. But the guys who want it all, chicas, champagne, flash...they don't last.' Words of wisdom from one Robert Loggia in Brian De Palma's hard-hitting depiction of the violent crime that permeates from greed and power.Our titular character (who, funnily enough, never refers to himself as Scarface throughout the film) is Tony Montana, a refugee from Cuba arriving in the United States in pursuit of the American dream. With the help of Frank Lopez and best buddy Manny Ribera, he climbs to the pinnacle of the cocaine industry, building an enviable empire that naturally leads to a lot of enemies.For all the memorable roles he has had over his career, surely Tony Montana is the role for which the incomparable Al Pacino will be remembered for. The actor has reportedly stated that this character remains his undisputed favourite, and with good reason. Pacino's intense performance is one which was initially criticized for overacting, but it's important to gain an understanding of the character before jumping to such conclusions. Montana is loud, full of hubris and as paranoid as he is ambitious. A more reserved performance would not accurately reflect these traits, which ultimately tell the tragic story of Scarface. Nominated for a Golden Globe back in 1984 on the back of this performance, Pacino brought the character to life, making Montana one of the most instantly-recognisable figures in film, and a character often imitated, but never duplicated.If the cinematography of Scarface had to be a colour, it would be a deep blood red, and not just because of the extreme violence. The sharp, in-close camera-work and energetic soundtrack are typical staples of cheesy 1980s cinema, but they work wonders in this film. Combined with the brutal script by Oliver Stone (who himself was battling a cocaine addiction while working on the film), they contribute in visually assaulting the viewer right from the outset. Where other films engage the audience at some points then lay low in a couple of trough scenes, Scarface starts with the volume turned up to ten and never lets go of the dial, before somehow pushing it up to about twelve for the climax. Despite this, the film never gets too excited for its own good. A couple of powerful scenes between Tony and sister Gina give weight to some people's arguments that he feels a romantic love for his relative, but more importantly, the interplay showcases De Palma's skills in fusing the emotional with the violent in creating a film whose images will be burnt in your mind long after the closing credits.One problem I have with Scarface (which actually has nothing to do with the film itself) is the way some musical artists and, subsequently, members of the younger generation have misconstrued the film's true meaning over time. De Palma makes it very clear by the conclusion that Tony is no hero; he is a tragic figure plucked right out of Ancient Greece and placed in contemporary Miami for us all to judge and learn from. In much the same way that Douglas's Gordon Gekko in 1987's Wall Street served as the inspiration for many people to quit their jobs in the pursuit of becoming ruthless players in the financial game, the message Montana has tried to convey has been swallowed up by the engaging nature of his character, which I suppose is the greatest testament to the overall quality of the film.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

It's a great movie don't get me wrong and Al Pacino turns in one of his best performances ever. The movie has been elevated to a level that it doesn't deserve however. The rap community in particular have made this movie almost a blueprint of how to make it in this country. That isn't the lesson of the movie but there you go.Al Pacino is really putting on a show here and his performance should have won an Oscar. The rest of the cast also turns in fine performances but Al carries the film. Scarface never seems to lag or threaten to turn boring. Riding with Tony Montana is a thrill ride that doesn't slow down until the film ends. The best part of the movie remains the closing when we get to say 'ello to Al's little friend. The whole film is good though and it's a classic. It isn't the greatest movie in history like some people say but it's pretty good. Bottom Line: Scarface is a kick ass movie but it isn't the Citizen Kane of gangster films like some people say it is. Make your own decision,Scarface

Carrie was a classic because it was penned by Steven King, and everybody could relate to it.  Many I know (not me) hate the high school scene.  He also did Mission: impossible.  Yuck. Now, this movie which is decent.This movie should have been in the hands of a more competent director. DePalma directs this like it was a mediocre movie.  It had alot of potential, but it just did not match up.  It was pointlessly fancy, and extremely long.  However, it did work in 1 really intriguing hour into its works.  That would be the middle hour, or Tony's rise, and just over the crest.  The montage which just about finished the good part of the movie was the longest montage with some of the longest scenes that I have ever seen. It was very excessive.  In many ways, the excess helped the movie, and in many ways it killed it.  It helped in the violence department.  It destroyed in the length department.  The running time of over 2.5 hours for an overly simple story evaporates interest in the story.  By the end, I wanted the movie to end so badly.  Was I supposed to feel sorry for Tony?  or not? 
Either way, it was entertaining, and people should see it to see the memorable violent scenes and quotes.  ""Say hello to my little friend""  Other than that this was a throw away movie exploring themes better than that.Part of the problem, and I think that the movie would have been much more entertaining if it was fixed, was the music.

It's movies like SCARFACE that make me wonder if critics and film buffs get together occasionally to play a practical joke on the rest of the world by pretending to like a bad movie, just to see if they can get everyone else to go along. Sorry if I seem bitter, but I feel like I've had three hours of my life stolen from me.",Scarface
242,allar100,Excellent Pacino,9,5 April 2003,"This in my opinion, is Pacino's best role.  He looked, sounded, and acted the part with an incredible amount of intensity without overacting.  A great script by Oliver Stone, I'm just a little curious as to why he let Brian DePalma have it.  DePalma does a great job with the direction.  The set design was top notch, cinematography was excellent, and the music, which should have bothered me because it was that hokey 80's movie stuff, just seem to fit.  Highly reccomended. 9/10",Scarface
243,Lucabrasisleeps,Incredibly engrossing movie,9,15 March 2015,"I remember the first time I saw this movie. I had watched a couple of Al pacino's 70s classics and I expected more of the same when I started seeing this. That is where I was wrong. I didn't get the quiet subtlety of the New Hollywood style. I even expected something similar to the Godfather. Instead I get an over the top style which I never expected. I get so many clichéd elements which I had seen in prior gangster films.But it works. I started enjoying the movie on my second viewing where I had different expectations. I just went with the ride and enjoyed the dialogue. The dialogue is the strongest part of the movie for me. There are too many quotes here which are so brilliant! There are so many clever insults and Tony's replies are so perfect. It is the dialogue and Al Pacino's performance that maybe elevates the movie from being just another 80s movie to a classic. People have complained about the accent. Frankly I don't know if Cubans talk with that accent or whatever but I enjoyed it. Do Cubans speak English with each other? Apparently not, but would people watch it if Al Pacino spoke those brilliant lines in Spanish? I am not so sure. His performance carries the movie and it goes from one great scene to the next.Robert Loggia also turns in an underrated performance as Frank Lopez. Steven Bauer is hilarious in many scenes as well as Manolo. The great thing about all these characters is that they really seem like South and Central Americans. They seem to have put so much effort into their roles.Another surprising thing for me was the length. It is an incredibly long movie and somehow it never feels that way. There is just too much happening in the movie and there are quite a few memorable scenes even when the action dies down in the second half. The ending action sequences are actually pretty impressive. Admittedly the last shot is not very believable. But till then, the action scenes are not over the top and are believable. I liked the slowdown in the second half and the focus on Tony's disillusionment. Sure that's a cliché that is seen in pretty much any gangster movie. But the clever lines and the hilarious exchanges (especially the one where Elvira is concerned about the F word!) were interesting to watch. I liked the shift of the arrogant Tony who wanted the world to somebody who becomes quickly disillusioned with the excitement, the money and the women. I also liked the realistic nature of the characters themselves. The situations may not be exactly realistic but the characters feel real, like they are from the streets. The relationship between Tony, Manolo and his sister was also another nice touch. Visually also it is a beautiful movie with the 80s fashions and the places.If you take the movie seriously, I think you would be disappointed. Instead it is best to go with the ride, enjoy the excesses and the hilarious lines. And one of the best performances of Al Pacino.9/10",Scarface
244,Kubris,*Slap* VIOLENCE,9,3 March 2012,"IMDb Top 250: 152That's how I described my first viewing of Scarface. For 20 minutes it stretches, jogs in place, then winds up and smacks you across the cheek with the first drug deal. But we'll discuss that later.In a class with The Terminator and Back to the Future, Scarface is one of the defining 80's films, and is a cultural landmark on its own. Unless you live in a sheltered community, you've definitely heard some lyrics or reference to the film in TV or music. In my case, I've even seen a car with Scarface towels for seat covers. It's one of the great stories of greed and ambition, and while not being the most thematic or symbol-heavy film, it has a good story and it tells it well.A simple plot: immigrant comes to America, won't work a crappy job, gets into the drug game, stays, rises, falls. There are a lot of them now but Scarface is one of the best.One of the most iconic aspects is the setting- Miami, 1980. The city is beautiful (despite being LA). The sets are lavish, and filled with amazing golden and sparkling things. The costumes are also impressive. You'll wish your suits or dresses were are flashy as these ones. The bright visuals separate Scarface from many gritty city films.As colourful as the locale is the characters that inhabit it, starting with the big man himself: Tony Montana is one of screen's great villains, and Al Pacino is an acting monster here. His amazing voice and brooding sneer are consistent and convincing. But everyone is amazing- it didn't register on the first viewing though. From Manny's girl crazy ways ( hilarious tongue flicking scene) to the cynical Elvira, the characters are larger than life and the performances match.There are many memorable moments that seem to flow into each other. The informative credits, the club shootout, the ending... many things can jump out, but I'd say the best scene, and the most important, is the first deal. It says: 'this isn't a mob story' and whenever Tony does anything later in the film, it's in our minds and we can tell it's in Tonys. This film could've gone wrong in many ways: it could've been shorter, or been cut down. But with Brian de Palma behind the camera, he made the film that he wanted. It's long and violent, even for today's standard. Maybe it is a bit too long- this certainly doesn't feel like a 2h 50min story- but that's a small complaint. Scarface takes its time, you cock- a-roach. The excellent script is filled with great lines like that one.One of the infamous aspects of the film is how society has interpreted it. 'Gangstas' today would lead you to believe Scarface is about criminals succeeding. This is not true. It can be easy to see why one would want to be Tony Montana, but look closer: Tony paid brutal prices, never achieved true happiness, and falls. We never see him in his prime, only a montage video, because success is not the point of the film.Many films are made to be like something else. Scarface spits on them. It sliced its own path, made its own mark, and is the inspiration for other films to this day. It's brutal and very memorable. 9.0/10",Scarface
245,lucasversantvoort,"I can see why it's a classic, but...",7,6 May 2015,"Scarface is a strange case for me, because while I quite like it, I'm unsure whether the film is as good as its reputation implies. Sure, as far as 'rise and fall' films go, it's lots of fun, but I've always felt Scarface is at its core extremely simplistic.Everyone probably knows the story, or at least the type of story. Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is fresh off the boat with his friend Manny (Steven Bauer). They're sent to a refugee camp in Miami where—at the behest of drug dealer Frank Lopez—they murder a former Cuban government official so they'll get their green cards. They're hired by Frank and this starts their rise up the criminal ladder. Frank takes a liking to Tony, but the independent-minded Tony starts 'making his own moves' to Frank's chagrin. Frank tries to have Tony killed, but fails. In return, Tony has Frank killed and takes of over his business and connections. Having now taken over the world and everything in it, it all goes downhill from there.It's not exactly a secret that Scarface is now considered a classic in the mob genre and it's not hard to see why. The grandiose production does a lot to reinforce what makes the film so iconic: the Miami locales, Tony's mansion, etc. It all conveys the feelings of decadence that accompanies Tony's rise to power and it also makes Scarface a fun watch.Needless to say, Pacino gives one of his most iconic performances. I remember reading a long time ago that his Cuban accent isn't really accurate, but I think that misses the point. Let's assume it's true that the accent isn't accurate. Does that reduce the impact of his character? Quite the opposite. It only enhances Tony's appeal, because when you quote him, you try to imitate the accent as well.The film itself is a classic 'rise and fall' tale. Tony wants power, but becomes a complete asshole and alienates everyone around him, when he finally assumes a position of power. It all comes tumbling down like aHouse of Cards and he pays the ultimate price. It's like a Shakespearean tragedy, maybe Richard III: antihero manipulates and kills his way to the top, woos the wife/girlfriend (Lady Anne and Elvira, respectively) of the previous ruler/drug dealer he's killed, assumes a position of ultimate power, becomes paranoid and is killed by rivals. Scarface executes this classic story in a way that's entertaining to watch, but the Richard III comparison also reveals the film's greatest weakness: lack of substance. Whereas Richard III is a complex tale still discussed to this day (see, for instance, Pacino's own 1996 documentary on the play), the only thing that's even remotely complex about Scarface are Tony's implied incestuous feelings toward his sister. This combined with some of Tony's character traits (his refusal to get women and children caught up in the mix) somewhat balances his paranoid asshole status in the film's second half, but it's not enough for this film to qualify as a character study or a study into the drug culture. In the end, it's a schlocky entertaining flick that impresses in terms of production values, acting, etc. The wonderfully destructive finale also helps.",Scarface

I think Brian De Palma was making a real statement with this movie that with money comes power and you must control that and the greed that comes with it as well. I cant stand that all these rapper types have latched onto this movie and say it is the greatest movie ever. They are taking all the good that can come from this movie and using all the hate that it has to sell back to the children that will by their music that live in the projects, and by doing so it is the rappers who are keeping their people down. If they would rap about what life is really about, love, family, friends, maybe God, and HARD WORK. Yes HARD WORK! What these rappers are selling is the idea that if you shoot rob and take all that you can you'll be happy with your new Nike's, Hillfigures, and video games. When it is really HARD Work that will get these kids were they need to be and to understand that if they try hard they themselves can change the way they live.Enough of that then, as for the movie Al Pacinio does a great job as showing a man rise from nothing and then fall from his greed. I think this is one of De Palma'S top five and speaking of that I bet the rappers who take this movie to heart don't even know who Brian De Palma is, would not surprise me.

248,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Pacino gives a heart-wrenching performance as the modern-day Macbeth,9,6 February 2011,"Brian De Palma's Scarface depicts cinema at its most macabre, and not for a second does Stone's cut-throat screenplay go awry in its unforgiving attempt to limn the naked reality associated with drug mafia and the kingpins who govern it. Brian De Palma's unquenchable thirst to mimic the gore reality on the celluloid didn't go well with the MPAA, which rated even the highly censored third cut of the movie as 'X'. Brian De Palma and the producer Martin Bergman arranged a hearing with the MPAA and roped in a panel of experts including some narcotics officers, who testified the movie's verisimilitude to the conditions prevalent in the drug underworld. Their testimonies greatly convinced the members of the rating board, who eventually condescended to give an 'R' rating to the aforesaid third cut of the movie. Brian De Palma used the pervasive kerfuffle as a subterfuge to release the unedited original version of the movie instead of the curtailed one and kept this fact surreptitious for months until the movie was released on videocassettes. A remake of a 1932 classic of the same name, Scarface portrays the life of a young, tempestuous Cuban émigré named Tony Montana, highlighting his sanguinary journey from being a thug to becoming a kingpin of drug mafia. Montana's story is one of rise and fall, trust and deceit, love and hatred, greed and lust, but most importantly: life and death. He is a hapless victim of the vicissitudes of his time; a product of his tainted conscience and naked ambition. As the modern-day Macbeth, Montana is the quintessential anti-hero of American cinema: he adores his friends and folks, and is unforgiving to his foes. Brian De Palma took yet another calculated risk by choosing Al Pacino, who was then going through a lean patch in his career, to play Montana's part. Pacino took few months off to prepare himself for the role and to perfect his Cuban accent. Chagrin driven, Pacino uses all his talent and guile to give Montana an ineffable charm and an element of frenzy, which not only brings Montana to life, but also makes the portrayal, singularly remarkable. Pacino's breathtaking performance, which is arguably his best, manages to hold the viewer in a transfixion right from the inception to the finale. In fact, it's clear from the very first scene itself (the first scene in which Pacino is interrogated by the police for being a Cuban emigrant) that Pacino is on an inexorable mission to outperform not only his contemporaries, but also himself. He punctiliously takes care of the nuances and the subtleties in mannerisms needed for an exorbitant portrayal such as Montana's. As Tony Montana, Pacino not only substantiates his acting prowess and answers his critics once and for all, but also establishes Montana as a cult figure in American cinema. The entire cast has given a thorough performance with a special mention of Michelle Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer. Pfeiffer is absolutely ravishing in her intense portrayal of the quintessential, uber-sexy mobster's moll. The chemistry between Pfeiffer and Pacino is scintillating and at times, awe-inspiring.The movie is a highlight reel of some of the most graphic and grotesque sequences ever caricatured in cinema. The scene in which Tony Montana asseverates his innocence and loyalty to the drug kingpin Frank Lopez elevates cinema to a new zenith, while the Macbeth like climax gives the movie an operatic feel that is seldom associated with cinema.Scarface marked the upsurge of a new force in cinema: the triumvirate of De Palma, Stone and Pacino. Almost three decades have passed since Scarface, but Al Pacino, Brian De Palma and Oliver Stone still enjoy a global iconic status as they continue to enthrall the audiences worldwide with their idiosyncratic cinematic styles.PS. Scarface has become a prototype in modern cinema and is one heck of a cinematic experience, but is not meant for the faint-hearted, or the sycophantic adherents of conservative cinema. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",Scarface
249,Blade_Le_Flambeur,Stunning,9,1 April 2003,"In order to celebrate my 25th review, I'm going to write about a very, very, very good film. Scarface. Filled with sharp photography and top- notch performances, this movie has it all. The performances are all excellent here- from Pacino's crime lord, to Michelle Pheifer's b----, to F. Murray Abrahama's drug lord assistance, the portrayals are perfect. Unfortunately, this film didn't get any academy award nominations. The script by Oliver Stone covers extensively everything a viewer should see, but the direction by Depalma is a bit lacking. The photography is beautiful and the score by Giorgo Moroder kicks serious a--. This film deserves to be in the top list, but unfortunately it isn't even on the top #250. Now, to the flaws. The two main problems for me are, first the swearing. There is just way too many f***'s to really enjoy the dilaouge. Second, the last twenty minutes, is just like a John Woo action film, which took away from the story. Even though this film runs at 2 hours 50 minutes, I definitely didn't feel it at all. Scarface, although minorly flawed, is one of the best films of all time. 9.75/10",Scarface
250,KatMiss,A MASTERWORK,10,28 July 2001,"Brian DePalma's ""Scarface"" is a masterwork; a three hour epic about the drug scene in Miami. Most of the criticisms seem to be over the language and violence. Both are so potent that the MPAA gave the film an X rating. I thought that was a little extreme.Perhaps it is because for some, this cuts a little too close to home. According to a book ""The Cutting Room Floor"", Miami cops testified that the film was very realistic. Oliver Stone wrote this film while kicking his cocaine habit, according to the biography ""Stone"". I believe that because the film is very harrowing to watch at times.Stone's script is unusual because it is so many different things. It is a social commentary about the drug culture and immigration and the effects of both on society. It is also a strong character study. Roger Ebert says it best when he calls the film ""a wonderful portrait of a real louse"". Most Hollywood films would gloss Tony Montana over, but it is to the credit of DePalma, Stone and producer Martin Bregman that they show Montana as a louse, plain and simple.But the strongest feature of ""Scarface"" is Al Pacino's performance as Tony Montana. Pacino has publicly said that Montana was his favorite performance and no wonder: Pacino has a field day chewing up the scenery. This performance came after his relatively subdued roles in ""Cruising"" and ""Author! Author!"", so he relished the opportunity to play such a larger than life character. He does it so well that we can sit throughout the lengthy running time (170 minutes plus intermission)and never be bored. It is quite a showcase for his talent and he deserved an Oscar for his efforts.As usual, the technical credits are superb. John Alonzo's Panavision photography is astonishing. DePalma demands the impossible and gets it.Giorgio Moroder's score also helps the film tremendously. It is quite different from the thriller scores, but effective in its' own way. The editing of the picture is exceptional and doesn't falter for all of its 170 minutes. DePalma's stylish direction is perfect in every way. He captures the violence, the humor and the pathos wonderfully. Another director wouldn't have done as good a job (well, maybe William Friedkin might have).I must warn you. While ""Scarface"" has very little nudity, it does have excessive violence and a plethora of foul language (Pacino says f*** at least 300 times). It is not for young children to see. A more appropriate range would be older teenagers and adults. They will be able to appreciate the social commentary and exciting action that DePalma and Stone deliver on screen.**** out of 4 stars",Scarface

What is even more interesting is that I did pay money to see the film when it was first in movie theaters. I found it to be a very hammy exercise in excess. Al Pacino was not only chewing (cursing, shooting, murdering, etc...) the scenery but it seemed like all of the actors were on the same terrible plane. There was no such thing as perspective in this movie which makes me appreciate other films within the genre like ""The Godfather"" movies, ""GoodFellas"" and in, arguably, Pacino's best performance, ""Donnie Brasco"".I don't think director Brian DePalma knew when to put on the brakes in some scenes and it made ""Scarface"" all the more worse while watching it.Sometimes some movies should not have been given the green light and I believe ""Scarface"" is one of them.",Scarface
252,SeminolePhenom,Say Goodnight to the Bad Guy...,9,17 November 2005,"In Miami during the 1980's, Tony Montana (Al Pacino) takes himself from nothing to becoming the biggest drug lord in Florida. From women to money to power, Tony experiences everything could ever dream of and things he wished he hadn't.Being one of my most favorite films of all time, I decided that my 100th review should be Scarface.Tony Montana is perhaps one the greatest movie characters of all time, due to the amazing actor who played him (Al Pacino) and the incredible story behind him. Rising from nothing, Tony quickly finds himself on top of the world after taking his original partners job, woman, and life. Betrayal, revenge, and loyalty are all major themes to a film in which describes the criminal mind so brilliantly detailed, that the film had to be three hours long.Al Pacino is a god, when it comes to film. He played Michael Corleone in The Godfather trilogy and many other characters that made him famous. But no one will ever play a character such as Tony Montana like Al Pacino. Flawless is the only word to describe the greatness of his acting during this film. The writing was already good, but Pacino gave the writing meaning with his tone and facial expressions, helping create some of the most memorable movie quotes of all time in large quantity.""Say goodnight to the bad guy"" describes the movie exactly. Tony Montana plays a vicious but needed character in society. Brian De Palma left out no detail in the life of Tony Montana. From chainsaw bloodbaths to cocaine addictions to a gang war in his mansion, Scarface could easily be considered one of the greatest visual experiences ever. I'm not going to go on and on about every single thing that makes this movie amazing but I will leave you with a final summary.

256,CowherPowerForever,I Kill a Communist For Fun,10,6 December 2014,"The 1983 version of the film Scarface will forever be known as a classic film. Not only one of the greatest gangster films, but one of the best films ever made in general. To review a film like this is very hard, because in my opinion, this is one of those perfect films. There is so much to talk about with this great film, that there is no room for one review on this site. My review will contain some behind the scenes notes and facts about the film as well as an added bonus that make it that much more interesting. The following is my review of Scarface.The story on this remake of the 1932 film of the same name was written by Oliver Stone. Oliver Stone is well know for films like Natural Born Killers, Platoon, and JFK. The original film followed a gangster during prohibition, while this story follows a gangster during the cocaine rush of the 1980s in Florida. While key aspects of the film aren't much different, the film makers on this version of Scarface did a fantastic job making this their own film. Very few remakes can say they are one of the best films ever made.To gain some knowledge on the subject at hand, writer Oliver Stone went to Colombia and actually spent time with these cocaine dealers. Over the course of spending time with these dealers, he became addicted to cocaine. To finish writing the film he had to fly to Paris to get away from all the drugs. The end result was clearly a masterpiece.The story itself is a rise and fall type story. In this case the film follows a Cuban refugee, who wants to become rich. He will do whatever it takes to realize that goal. He builds himself up as a man that can be trusted to earn his way up the ladder of success. With great money and great power also causes great problems. The story about the life of drug users and pushers that Stone crafted was simply fabulous. The characters are rich in nature, and this is easily some of the best character development you will see in a film. There are a great deal of scenes where we see back and forth talking, and this is where the amazing acting comes into play.The acting lead by the star, Al Pacino is simply one of the best all around for a film. Not only does this film star the legend Al Pacino, but it also stars greats like Steven Bauer, Robert Loggia, Michelle Pfeiffer, F. Murray Abraham, and many more as well. The actors gel amazingly in this film. To have scenes where actors need to sit there and talk back and forth, and to have it be great is not easy. That is where the fabulous cast comes into the picture. Director Brian De Palma really shows how great of a director he is in this aspect of the film. To not only have a fantastic acting team like this, but to turn that into amazing acting is not always a given, but De Palma succeeded in this film, as did the actors.Director Brian De Palma delivers one of the better gangster films of all time in this outing. De Palma is well know for other hit films like Carrie, The Untouchables, Carlito's Way, and Mission: Impossible. His vision he makes for the screen is in fact legendary. There are some scenes with brutal violence, but De Palma never really takes it over the top into what we would now call a gore fest. He makes you feel the pain that is about to come. A great film maker can do that, and De Palma is a legend.The film was composed by Giorgio Moroder who is also well know for the scores on films like American Gigolo and Flashdance. Moroder delivers a heavy 1980s score that really captures the nature of the film and the story. Some might now consider this type of score cheesy, but for the time this film takes place, it work amazing. The score adds so much depth to the film as well. Moroder has a strong outing on this classic film, and should not be overlooked.In closing, they say remakes are bad. However, Scarface from 1983 is one example where a remake can be fantastic and legendary. I rarely dish out a perfect 10 out of 10 for films, but Scarface is a rare film that deserves that much respect. This film is a classic, and should be an instant watch for all film lovers out there.10/10",Scarface

259,kyle_c,Entertaining but Flawed,7,20 July 2002,"""Scarface"" is not the masterpiece many believe it to be.  It is also not as terrible as many others believe it to be.  What it is is a prime example of De Palma's over-the-top style of directing.  Everything about this movie - the script, the acting, the directing, are all overblown.  And while it shows no restraint whatsoever, perhaps that is part of its interest.The story chronicles the life of Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban immigrant who rises to power in the Miami underworld.  It begins with his rise to power from nothing, and continues on through his downfall.  The script is well written for the most part, except it tends to drag in places and is quite loose.  The acting is solid, but as said before, perhaps a little over the top. Pacino is convincing as Montana, and most of the cast performs well, although everybody seems to be in an extremely emotional state at all times. Much of the dialogue is angry, and the characters are never really fleshed out to any great extent.  The major flaw in this movie is the fact that most of the characters are rather despicable, eliciting little sympathy from me.The directing is interesting to watch, but needlessly flashy.  Take, for example, the scene where Montana is getting in the car and the camera does the track out, zoom in trick, used most notably in Hitchcock's ""Vertigo."" Obviously, this is a display of Hitchcock's influence on De Palma, but what De Palma forgets is that Hitchcock used it for a reason. In the context that it is used in ""Scarface"", it is totally unnecessary. But, it fits in with the over-the-top appeal of the movie.While I wouldn't say this movie is excellent, it does provide some solid entertainment.  And despite the fact that it does drag a little, and is lacking in character development, it does succeed in providing some excellent action sequences, which will definitely please many fans.*** out of ****",Scarface
260,kols,Pointless,1,3 March 2014,"When I first heard that Stone and Pacino were remaking Scarface I was intrigued. What did they think they could add to Paul Muni's Original? As soon as the movie came out, from the very first scene, I knew: nothing.The only thing the two movies had in common was the title. Why they had announced it as a remake was a mystery.So I sat back, now without expectation, to see what movie they had made.Throughout the screening I paid close attention to all of Scarface's elements, from cinematography to acting, and finally came to the conclusion that the only reason the movie was made was Stone's ego and Pacino's determination to prove how greatly he could ham it up.Scarface, despite its commercial success, is a manneristic disaster that never should have seen the light of a projector.I do not agree that any of its flaws are fatal - overacting, lack of story, pacing, poor cinematography have all been overcome in numerous movies.What made those movies was something to care about; Scarface lacks that quality. Tony Montana is a nonentity; Pacino's portrayal is not that of a independent character but of an 8-year-old's fantasy of being as bad as possible. In short, there is no Tony Montana - only Pacino playing out that fantasy.And this is a crime common to many, especially many successful, directors and actors. More common among the Europeans but spectacular when an American puts his ego above the audience.So Scarface is a movie about nothing and no one, punctuated with a great deal of equally pointless violence.Many have pointed out that Pacino's overacting and the extreme of carnage were meant to makes points, to portray the real-world carnage of the drug trade.Pardon me? There's no hint of reality in the movie. Pacino isn't portraying a low-life, low-class 'Gangsta'. Pacino's trying to achieve an epic ham. He succeeded so well that the character was left behind.My reason for writing this review now is a show I saw last night that traced Scarface's transformation from critical bomb to cult classic. One of the show's implication was that all the critics were wrong - I disagree for the reason listed above.As for cult status - fine, even if Plan 9 from Outer Space was a better movie.",Scarface

263,ereinion,De Palma's finest work,10,25 March 2005,"SCARFACE is definitely Brian De Palma's best film and the only one that isn't flawed or too violent and disturbing. It follows the story of a Cuban refugee in Florida who eventually becomes a major drug lord through connections with a powerful Columbian cartel boss. His best friend is Manny, played by Steven Bauer in his best performance yet, who is the more humorous of the two and is the only man Tony can always rely on. More strong supporting roles by Loggia as Montana's old boss, Michelle Pfeiffer as his love interest, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as his sister whom he is sickly protective of and a fine cameo by F. Murray Abraham as his ill-fated partner who gets whacked in a memorable scene.De Palma balances humor, violence, love and drama very well in this film. Nearly all the characters are fascinating and well created, like in his second best film ""Carlito's Way"", and the dramatic intensity remains as strong throughout the movie. From the rebuking by his mother through his difficult relationship with Elvira and finally the ultimate tragic ending, this movie is not an easygoing affair. Yet its suspenseful twists and interesting characters make you sit all the way through it's 170 minutes and the ending leaves you emotionally shaken. There is a lot to pity in Tony and his dark and violent end. Al Pacino turns in a simply breathtaking performance which is one of the strongest points of this film and the very reason why you can't get your eyes off the screen. He gives his character a unique emotional weight and strength.This is indeed a work which belongs up there with all the best.10 out of 10.",Scarface
264,joshuafagan-64214,"An Intense, Gripping Piece of Art",8,25 July 2016,"4 out of 5 Stars Contrary to popular opinion, there were a lot of good eighties films. This is one of the best. DePalma's three-hour-long epic about a Cuban outlaw who comes to the United States and becomes a fearsome drug kingpin is one of the most stark, haunting, and rich cinematic experiences of the decade. While not without flaws, it is a towering cinematic achievement, filled with vivid imagery, spectacular acting, and a raw intensity that was extremely rare then and was extremely rare now.The eighties are my least favorite decade in modern history, and a lot of its films reflect its worst qualities. They are trite, overblown, and senseless. They prefer artifice over truth, and often attempt to sell artifice as truth. If I didn't know better, I'd say they were made by robots that are trying to understand human emotions. Rampant commercialism and an inability to connect with their audience- or people in general- ruin many of these films. A lot of eighties films are lack a metallic plant: ""Oh, you liked this organic, lush sprout? Here, let us make one for you but take out all the lushness and organicness you liked about it. There. Aren't you happy?"" What the great eighties movies, whether they be dramatic or comedic, have in common is that they deal with the grandiosity of the decade. Back to the Future and Ferris Bueller's Day Off both ride that grandiosity for all it's worth. You feel like you're getting away with something when you watch them. It's fantastic. On the other hand, a film like Heathers goes right at the excess and insanity, providing something of an antidote to it. Then there is the third option: rip that grandiosity off the tracks and show its horrendous underbelly. That is what this film does.This a film that could only have been made in the eighties. Nowadays, filmmakers take a different approach to portraying the excess of the eighties- see The Wolf of Wall Street. But in this film, the tragedy of 80's excess is shown in that same level of 80's excess. While this could have played to the film's detriment, it ends up creating a deeper and more believable world. It plays better now than it does back then. The opulence Tony- our protagonist- surrounds himself in during the third act of the tale is more surreal and arcane than it was back then. A modern filmmaker can attempt to replicate the insanity, but it would be a conscious decision and thus would not flow as well into the fabric of the film.It helps that this film was made by two of the most fundamentally 80's filmmakers in existence: I already mentioned DePalma, but this film was written by Oliver Stone. Both men have of course made films outside the 80's, but they were at their best in the 80's, are distinctly remembered for the films they created in the eighties, and represented many of the highs and lows of the eighties.The action is strong, particularly in the famous final scene, and the acting is good, though not great. There are a few pacing problems, though I appreciate the film's scale. The character work is shoddy, but the narrative is well written. The cinematography, music, and style of the film are exemplary. The combination of shadows and long shots with bursts of violence evoked the image of a predator stalking their terrain.While not the greatest work in its genre, Scarface not only remains a tremendously influential film, but an intense, unsettling, thoroughly entertaining film. I duly recommend it.",Scarface

266,CherryBlossomBoy,"Went for grandeur, forgot about the title character",5,21 August 2009,"The name ""Scarface"" and a tribute to Howard Hawks is a bit misleading as this is not really a remake of 1932 classic. It is ""Godfather"" updated for more modern times and a bit more action and violence. One could call it ""Godfather"" on steroids or something like that. It is the same old saga of a small-time gangster's rise to power with different names, locations and perhaps personalities.There are some novelties here compared to ""Godfather"" though. Along with intense action and violence there are plenty of humorous one-liners that in a way contrast the action. ""Say hello to my little friend"" accompanied by a blast from grenade thrower has since become a template for action movies to come. That undoubtedly contributed to the sentiment that prompted many people to praise ""Scarface"" as classic.But in reality, everything that is good about this movie is owed to ""Godfather"" I and II. The attempt at grandeur, the pace, the time span and the overall style. Even some scenes, for instance, one of the most poignant scenes in the movie, when Montana character kills his sister's husband, are directly lifted from Coppola's classics. Pacino has the lead role in both ""Godfather"" and ""Scarface"" and here he plays Montana, the hungry, the angry, the mad, but in fact just a rougher version of Michael Corleone.What's bad about ""Scarface"" is entirely down to Brian De Palma's direction and Oliver Stone's screenplay. The supposed grandeur of this epic boils down to drag. The movie is simply too long. Longevity helps the grandeur but not if it's full of scenes and dialog that contribute nothing to the story, which is the case here. De Palma's responsibility was to cut off the dead weight and bring those memorable scenes closer.Stone's responsibility was to write a coherent story where all characters and situations were properly established and explained, foremost the title character. Unfortunately that didn't happen and the resulting script was at best anecdotal and at worst a mess. Stone chose to direct his efforts to his notorious obsession with governmental conspiracies. It's constantly been insinuated, through the film, that a lot of what was going on in the underground is in some way connected to the powers that be. Stone forces the dialog to get that point of his across over and over. It seems that he knows all about how government works but he has no clue how organized crime works. That's why we don't get inside enough to see what Montana bases his power and influence on. We only get to see what big shots he hangs out with and who he eliminates, but it's never established, for instance, why his people are loyal to him or where he found the money to start his own empire. ""He's got balls"" doesn't quite explain it.It turns out that the character we should know the most about we know the least. Other characters may be clichéd but at least their actions and motives are more clear. In turn, Montana himself never learns anything. He exits the stage that is his life the same person he entered: raw, reckless and oblivious to anything but himself. Rather cartoonish, isn't it?Funny how once cops proclaimed this to be the most realistic depiction of organized crime. The ""realism"" bar has been raised many times since. The movie is still good to see for its few scenes that are guaranteed to stick and for its loud message that ""crime (allegedly) doesn't pay"", but keep your thumb on fast-forward button.",Scarface
267,jcanettis,"Somewhat Dated Perhaps, But Still Unmissable",9,14 November 2004,"With so many gangster films having been released since it first appeared in 1983, ""Scarface"" should perhaps be excused for bringing up a somehow dated feeling to the viewer. Stories about criminals climbing (and killing) their way to the top are not an uncommon theme in many movies; in fact, there are several masterpieces belonging in this genre, such as ""Goodfellas"" and ""Once Upon A Time In America"".And yet, ""Scarface"" has something original and unique in it that cannot be easily reproduced. Al Pacino is simply unforgettable as Tony Montana, the ruthless and self-destructive Cuban exile who became mighty cocaine boss in Miami, rising from obscurity as a puny dish-washer. Michelle Pfeiffer is also giving a great performance as his beautiful wife Elvira, whose life is full of vanity, coke-snorting, and boredom. The other members of the cast are also very good, with Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio standing out in her role as Tony's hapless sister Gina. And finally, Brian De Palma has one of his finest hours in directing this film, which perhaps is his best so far in his career.""Scarface"" is one of those unmissable films, no matter how many years pass. 9/10.",Scarface

He wants the best things, best woman and best life and he thinks he found a shortcut to get there, but the problem for Tony is it's an unlawful shortcut and there are boundaries he shouldn't have crossed, while it's a fast way to get to riches, it does not bring satisfaction, because you need to hide behind walls, from law and your enemies and all the people you care about hate it. The film makes a strong point against being a criminal, well you might cheat the system, but it will not accept you and you will not feel free, I guess it's a case when if you do an honest living, your soul is clean and you feel somewhat free...

269,pinokiyo,Definitely a classic. They can't make it like this anymore,9,10 July 2016,"Took me all these years to finally see this classic film, even though everyone, even those who have never seen it, should know the famous ""Say hello to my little friend"" line. The film is almost 3 hours, which seems like it would be a drag and way too long to sit through, but it actually went by faster than many dumb films these days with no substance.Of course, Al Pacino's performance is perfect and amazing as Tony Montana. You can't help but like the guy... he's not just some straight out one-dimensional vicious killer, but he is a guy who isn't afraid to be truthful and not be a ""cockroach"". He has some limits to his morality of not killing kids; wants to value his family, but at the same time wrecks it with no self-control. He's overly protective of his little sister that he would kill anyone for her. The biggest threat to him was himself. What's very interesting is how the film is able to capture the crippling decline of what happens when money and power/control gets to you. It's not just some shallow dumb movie shooting random bad guys that many action films is only able to do and there's no character.Tony Montana, ""Scarface"", is a household name now because it's all about the depth of the character. Even the side character's like Michelle Pfeiffer, Gina, Manny, they all have character in them. I read some negative reviews from some people saying how the film is just about violence and degrade women, etc. and that it has no story... boy, are they wrong and only seeing it on the surface. Got to love the typical 80's overused montages. Haha They can't make films this raw and violent... the 80's really knew how to do it, like Robocop.

271,TheNabOwnzz,Superb morality play about the corruptive nature of greed & power,9,11 November 2018,"Undoubtedly one of the all time greats in its depiction of the rise and fall of a certain character and/or their empire, Scarface is a fascinating moral drama which slowly descends further into madness and greediness.The character of Tony Montana, who is ofcourse brilliantly portrayed by Al Pacino, is one of the most fascinating and morally complex anti hero protagonist's in cinema. Mind you, he is generally never shown as being any more than a greed ridden psychopath with little consideration of human life, but Tony's backstory about him fleeing communist Cuba and his subsequent hatred for this ideology does give him tons of depth as to why he is the person that he is today. Even though he is quite unlikeable from the start, his descent into madness combined with his rise to power does truly slowly show the audience what the corruption of a position of power does to a human being, in a way that is quite similar to the excellent portrayal of Daniel Day Lewis as Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood (2007). Both characters are selfish, arrogant and slightly psychopathic from the start, but their descent into madness is still a really fascinating piece of character development., as Tony is gradually shown succumbing to his own greed.As possibly the ultimate Al Pacino performance, it is no secret that his acting is absolutely brilliant as Tony Montana. Anger, hatred, and even a bit of disconnection and sadness ( In scenes with his mother for example, who shuns him for the life he leads ) are all emotions that Al Pacino captures perfectly in his role. This versatile and emotional performance really shows the wide range of his acting capabilities after the quite monotonous and calculated character of Michael Corleone that he portrays in The Godfather. Other excellent performances are provided by the likes of Robert Loggia, F. Murray Abraham & Michelle Pfeiffer as the stand-outs of this superb cast.The set design truly immerses the audience into breathing the Miami air by its atmospheric replication of it, as most of the film was filmed in Los Angeles due to a lot of Cubans in Miami presumably protesting against the subject of this film. Particularly the color palette is outstanding, and provides many beautiful images during the nearly three hour running time. There is a lot of variation in color, as one might expect from a film that portrays something as lively as Miami. It does however not serve to be there to brighten up the day, as the film itself is quite hopeless, dark & in a way, even quite sad. Brian de Palma uses a lot of variation in his scenes, with many shots panning right, left, up or down, and sometimes varying between them during the same shot. This makes every scene and every encounter look fresh, interesting and dynamic. Oliver Stone's screenplay also results in quite a fascinating coherent narrative that slowly but surely brings Tony closer to his inevitable fall, which ironically is caused by one of the very few 'morally good' actions that Tony performs ( Saving the family, which causes Sosa to send assassins after him ). This is also a nice avoidance of typical Hollywood cliché's, because it shows us that performing the morally right deed will not always end in joy.The original score by Giorgio Moroder is fantastic, with a simple synthesizer melody that perfectly captures the duality of Tony's situation, as there is a sense of superiority in it which symbolizes Tony being on top of the world, but there is also a sense of eeriness in it which symbolizes the impending doom and death that is coming for him. The final scene in particular is also a fantastic visual example of this, as Tony falls into the pool with the statue behind him stating 'The world is yours', which is ofcourse a superb bit of irony of his gradual corruption to get to the top.There are some slighly absurd sequences, such as the scenes in which Gina ( Tony's sister ) is with some guy and Tony's compulsive protection disorder takes over, which shows us a close up of Tony's eyes while some triggering music plays. It seems kind of forced and lacks a bit of subtlety, which is something that is handled very well in the rest of the film. It is also quite obvious that Tony takes a bit too many bullets in the final sequence to still be standing, but this can be categorized as 'Suspension of disbelief'. Still, the final shootout is in a way quite reminiscent to Taxi Driver's, except that in Scarface the attempted scale of the fight results in quite an absurd and ridiculous firefight, with Tony gunning down about 20 professional hitman while being shot about 30 times. However, the gunfight itself is technically executed very well. The rich set design of the mansion as the beautiful shootout location, the fantastic editing, and the competent direction really does create a superb action sequence.Scarface is a fantastic and atmospheric study on greed, and is indeed much deeper than the 'Shoot 'em up gangster flick' it is for some reason many times labelled as.",Scarface
272,hooma814,"""Say hello to my little friend!!!""",9,23 February 2020,"This movie was epic!
Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to end. I had always wondered why Al Pacino was so highly regarded. After watching this and the Godfather its now clear why. He gave such an authentic performance, it was hard not to believe that Al Pacino was not in fact Tony himself. The opening and ending scenes for me were some of the best. The brillance of Tony's quick thinking mind to be able to stand up to anyone. He really was fearless, standing up to all these people. But at the same time he was so broken. There was so much character development in one story, unlike many I had seen before. The cast and the set design as well as the music all contributed so well to take this movie to the next level. And of course the ending, it was so satisfiying to see where the famous one liner had come from. Tony himself had me cracking up at different points too. ""You done boss? Can I go?""

Pacino always delivers, but he does not out-do what he gave us in ""Godfather II"" or ""Dog Day Afternoon"", or even ""Carlito's Way"". The violence is graphic, the language unbearable, but the characters are predictable. There are a few terrific performances aside from Pacino...a 'pre-Amadeus' F. Murray Abraham delivers well as the ill-fated Omar Suarez, Miriam Colon steals the scene from Pacino as the Mama filled with pride, and angry as she sees her son's descent into the nether-world of drugs and crime. It's what I wish Beryl Mercer would have said and done with Cagney in The ""Public Enemy"". This film is a difficult watch because it travels forth in almost real-time, and if you miss a little...you miss a lot. It is not for kids. Also, while the film was dedicated to Hawks and Hecht, I don't think the contribution of Seton I. Miller to the original screen-play should be overlooked.

But I don't know what's funnier - the movie, or some people taking it seriously.First of all, there's the Cuban ""accent"" issue. This may not be obvious to American viewers, but Al Pacino's accent is so terrible here that he looks like a cartoon, like a parody of his ""bad guy"" persona. What's funny is that he thinks he's doing a great job. Even great actors, including Al Pacino, look ridiculous when they try unfamiliar accents (remember Richard Burton in ""Villain"" or Pacino again in ""Revolution""). There's no way in hell that's a great performance, unless you're deaf. The script doesn't help either. Saying a thousand time ""f*king f*ck"" is just ludicrous (no, it's not scary, shocking or compelling). Pacino's goofy mannerisms will make you laugh. It's intended to be over the top, yes, but that ""accent"" undermines his acting. This is a masterpiece of the ""unintentionally funny"" category, and for that reason only it is indeed enjoyable. Whoever wrote ""Scarface"" must be pretty low on brain cells. All the characters, including Scarface himself, are so unsympathetic that you can hardly wait to see them all wiped out. But that's not the problem here. The problem is of course the bad acting, the dim-witted dialogues, the tiresome violence that turns comical after a while. The ""so 80's"" soundtrack is a blast.

Al Pacino was his regular solid self, and Michelle Pfeiffer fairly ordinary which is to be expected. The degree of violence and swearing in the movie was an indication of the direction these kind of movies were taking as the eighties rolled into the nineties. This is another movie you can't help but admire the wardrobe on. The sheer arrogance of the manner the leads wear their clothes allows them to pull off a look that is laughable, yet amazingly stylish. One must applaud such a show.

279,wrestlingsitewebmaster,Scarface,10,24 February 2008,"A truly awesome film boosting some quality characters and some damn right awesome fighting parts. However my only complaint about this was when they showed the bath room scene where Tony Montana's brother was brutally murdered by a chain saw, this was revolting and this did not have to appear in the film because of it's extreme brutality, but they included it anyway, Christ knows what the producers thought when they included this scene.Al Pacino was superb in the role and a nice touch about the film was when the writers and producers included actual footage of when former Cuban leader Fidel Castro booted out some of his countrymen and they were forced to go to Miami, Florida. It boosted a superb motion picture as well and a positively awesome scene were the Cuban refugees where playing basketball in the camp. The riots which they filmed looked damn right real, top marks go to the extra's involved for filming that and making it look real as possible.This writer remembers watching a documentary on BBC3 about drugs in Miami in the 1980's which the late, soap legend Mike Reid who played Frank Butcher in the BBC soap Eastenders talked about the documentary, and a person interviewed mentioned Scarface and his words were 'The banks didn't care about money laundering, you may remember a scene in Scarface where he (Tony Montana) walked into a bank in Miami with his laundered money and the bank didn't say a word.' This writer also has the game Scarface for the Playsation 2 and this boosts a very complex storyline as well.The film boosts some outstanding sun sets in Miami as well as some good dialog between characters for example you may recall a scene where Montana visit's his younger sister and mother and gives them a thousand dollars only for his mother to tell him to stick it. This part was well written.Scarface truly ranks as one of the greatest films ever made along with the Sawshank Redeption and Dirty Dancing.Overall Grade - A**",Scarface
280,dishlady69,Say Hello to My Little Friend (No Spoilers),7,2 September 2018,"I've always been told this was an important film for Pacino (even though I still think it was the Godfather Trilogy that set him up for most of his future roles) and was finally able to watch it all the way through. A modern-day morality tale based on real issues from the overlapping 1980s crises. In many ways it picks up on a storyline that the Godfather Trilogy was poking at repeatedly. An interesting appearance by Michelle Pfeiffer, who is normally the OCD/peppy/creative lead in the movies in which she plays a more prominent role. It's interesting to see where Pacino's character (Tony) feels he should draw the line in terms of moral behavior. If you haven't seen the film yet, be ready for a few surprises, and the zillion scenes involving pools (no spoilers), but there are also a few predictable parts in my opinion (again, no spoilers).",Scarface
281,eamon-hennedy,"Pacino, guns and chainsaws. Fantastic.",8,3 November 2003,"One of the most definitive gangster films of the 80's, Scarface is very much a film of its time. The first thing you notice when  you watch this film is that it is screaming at you, 'made in 1983'. The costumes, the music score and soundtrack, the hairstyles, make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80's and while it should have dated horribly it hasn't. This is still a superb film. While Georgio Moroder's music has dated a fair bit, it still compliments the story of Tony Montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by Oliver Stone and the first class direction of Brian De Palma, one of two films that he has made with Pacino (the other being the fantastic Carlito's Way). All of De Palma's trademarks are here; the strong language, the graphic violence (more on that later), the stylish excesses such as grandiose set pieces and of course the stylish camera work.
Pacino dominates the film and I mean that literally. He is the dominant star of this film. His performance over the top, this is one of those films were Pacino doesn't so much say his lines as he does shouts them, this time with a superb Cuban accent. However, this is Pacino and he does it fantastically. Only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact. While some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all, this is an excessive film. Take a look at the production design of Tony's house, take a look at the violence in this film. The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere. The shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the Rambo films. Take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so Pacino's performance I suppose is perfect for the film. He is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way. Steven Bauer, in particularly, as Manny, Tony's  best friend, is the stand out of the supporting cast. His performance is so controlled and quiet in a De Niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn. Michelle Pfeiffer, of course, adds the glamor, Robert Loggia adds gravitas as usual and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio makes a great debut as Tony's sister.Of course this is more than just a film about excess. There is more to it than drugs, violence, chainsaw assaults and a big great shoot out. This is a film about the darker side of the American dream. In many ways it puts it on a thematic par with The Godfather films. Tony finds himself coming to America, getting it all, living the American dream and then losing it all in violent fashion, and by saying he loses it all, I mean he loses it all. He kills his best friend, his sister is killed, his empire crumbles, literally, around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion, bullets ripping through him. Without doubt Scarface is one of the key films of the early 80's. Sure, it doesn't  have the subtleties of The Godfather films, but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again.",Scarface

The lines are written like it was for a high school play, the acting is like a soap opera. The worst is Al, his accent is one of the worst ever in movies.

283,Waedliman,Good with flaws,7,11 March 2021,"Brian De Palma can sometimes forget the content over his aesthetics. This then hides gaps in the story, but if you look closely, you discover them. With ""Scarface"", too, I have a few question marks that don't resolve themselves, but, as is often the case with the masterful camera work, I simply forget them again, am delighted by Pacino's performance and that of some of the other actors, am not so annoyed by the sometimes chargant supporting roles and extras, sometimes find Giorgio Moroder's music appropriate, and sometimes not, and in the end I am a little disappointed because the almost 3 hours would not have been necessary for this rather thin story about a man who is interested in a quick dollar, who does not lose his machismo and whose own family only serves as a justification for morals that he has long since lost on other levels. ""Scarface"" could have been a masterpiece, but only joins the ranks of good, unfortunately not perfect films.",Scarface
284,writerasfilmcritic,A Good Movie But Not a Great One,7,23 March 2006,"""Scarface"" is a good movie, but not a great one. There are a number of good scenes and good performances, but some definite flaws. It is certainly an entertaining effort, especially early on, starting with the interview of the surly Cuban immigrant, Tony Montana (Al Pacino) by skeptical US officials. Soon thereafter comes the horrific chainsaw execution of his partner at a Miami drug deal gone about as bad as one can go. Here, we witness the first lapse in judgment by Montana's close friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), who flirts with a blonde in a bikini instead of providing immediate backup as one of his friends is brutally killed and the other (Tony) is just about to face the same fate. We are then introduced to small time coke dealer Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and his beautiful girlfriend, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). Tony is bowled over by her charms and decides almost immediately that he must possess this woman, no matter what the risk. However, the supposed sexual chemistry that should be evident between them is unconvincing. His motivation comes off more like some sort of business deal or arrangement than anything else. He thinks Elvira is ""a tiger"" and wants her to be the mother of his children, yet he doesn't seem to have any great physical desire for her. This is definitely a serious flaw, because it is Frank's fear of Tony and his jealousy over Elvira that drives him to order a hit on Montana. But Tony survives and gets even in one of the more effective scenes in the movie. From that point on, although little seems to be stopping him, nothing goes quite right for Tony again. Excess clouds his thinking at almost every turn and leads to his eventual downfall. For example, his relationship with Elvira starts to deteriorate soon after they are married. She is always stoned, can't give him any children, and apparently is disinterested in sex. Seeming both drunk and sloppy with dope, he insults her publicly and she stalks out of the fancy restaurant and his life. The incident is followed by one of the film's better moments, Tony's ""I'm a bad man"" soliloquy in front of all ""the rich mummies"" who were attempting to enjoy their meal.Alejandro Sosa, effectively played by Paul Shenar, is (along with Frank Lopez and Manny) one of the films most engaging characters. The Bolivian cocaine manufacturer and drug lord is rich, urbane, and sophisticated, yet there is something truly menacing and sinister about him. Like Montana, he kills first and asks questions later, demonstrating his ruthless streak by almost casually ordering the execution of Tony's associate and Frank's lieutenant, Omar Suarez (well played by F. Murray Abraham) when they meet at his Bolivian hacienda to discuss a major cocaine deal. Shenar died only six years after this film was released, which was too bad because obviously he was a gifted actor. When he tells Montana, ""Don't you ever f*** me, Tony,"" you know he means it, despite the peculiar way of expressing himself. Steven Bauer, by the way, was in real life an authentic Cuban émigré and, as Manny, has one of the best roles in the movie. He is (almost) always there to back up Tony and keep him on an even keel, which is a major task if ever there was one because Tony is definitely crazy, and the more cocaine he snorts, the crazier he gets. Ironically, it is nice guy Manny's second major lapse which leads to the entire Montana organization's downfall. However, only after Tony dramatically demonstrates that there is a moral line he won't cross, though driven to a breakdown by bad breaks and cocaine abuse, does he do what cannot be forgiven and his fate is truly sealed.On the down side of this cinematic effort, several of Montana's associates don't seem nearly sinister or tough enough to be part of a gang of ruthless killers and drug smugglers. In fact, once the inevitable war breaks out between Montana and Sosa (as predicted by Frank Lopez), Sosa's army of thugs infiltrates and overwhelms Montana's compound, eliminating the weak and disorganized resistance as if they were dealing with a bunch of schoolgirls. It comes off as thoroughly unbelievable where it ought to be one of the most carefully crafted scenes in the film since it precedes the climax -- Tony's fiery end. In conclusion, this film has one abiding message -- cocaine is bad and it will destroy you. We already knew that going in. Like I said, it's an entertaining movie with some good performances and a few great scenes, but it is not a great movie to rank among the best.",Scarface
285,stebird,Cult classic of greed and excess,10,18 July 2017,"Thirty four years old, but Brian De Palma's Scarface still to this very day stands as one of the all time great crime and gangster films.Its premise is staggeringly simple, a Greek tragedy that sees the rise of one of cinema's greatest ""villains"", Tony Montana (Al Pacino), and subsequent downfall in sickening style. Whereas other high-end crime films e.g. The Godfather, The Godfather part 2, Goodfellas and Casino succeed with an immaculately polished story that transcends beautifully onto the screen..., Scarface threw the rule book out and redefined the generally accepted guidelines.So violent, brutal and politically incorrect, there are many faults to be found and one doesn't have to look too deep to find them, but why over-analyse such a disgustingly beautiful masterpiece?For example, the chainsaw scene where Tony and his henchmen are making a drug deal in a hotel room, the deal goes south in a hurry and Tony and his ""amigo"" Angel end up chained up in the bathtub. Graphic scenes unsuitable for all ages quickly ensues, the stomach churning sounds of pain and desperation, the blood soaking into everything in sight..., no holds barred indeed!Even the romantic element revolving around Tony and Elvira, Tony and his younger sister Gina, Manny and his budding romance with Gina, they are executed faithfully, at all times maintaining the hard-hitting, all out brutal style of Scarface. Elvira, whom Tony takes as his own roughly half way through the film, has very little patience or even any real attraction towards her man, she is clearly a gold-digger who takes whoever has the upper hand in the mob world, and whoever she can score some ""yay"" off. Gina is Tony's foil, genuine love, fear and and a feeling of over protection towards his little sister exists..., all the money, power and drugs in the world cannot come between the love of a brother towards his baby sister.With a ""remake"" of Scarface due for release soon, that makes me a little sad, how can you better something this close to perfect? In no world can I see anybody other than Al Pacino play the title role, casting at its very finest, Alixe Gordin who did the casting for Scarface demonstrated true genius, not only by casting Pacino, but by casting the whole ensemble, Michelle Pfeiffer was fabulous, as was Steven Bauer.Yes as I mentioned there is a new Scarface in the works, but nothing, and I mean nothing will stop the allure the ""original-remake"" possesses.Top marks across the board and if you haven't watched Scarface yet, do so, it's vital viewing for any film fan.",Scarface
286,alexkolokotronis,"Loved, But For The Wrong Reasons",10,14 July 2008,"Many people like this movie and many more love it, but it seems that it is all for the wrong reasons. Scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is.Many people say the acting was over-the-top, but who better to do an over-the-top character than Al Pacino. To say that Pacino went over-the-top in here would be an understatement. Yet he does it so well, he just brings the inner devil out of you so well. His character Tony Montana was not such a great guy to begin with but his thirst for power just bring his sickness of greed to another level; an inhumane level. Sure at times Pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a liability at all. The supporting cast served its job very well. Michelle Pfeiffer was not really at her best but she certainly fit the role she played. On the other hand Steven Bauer was at his best, still he is Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and like Michelle Pfeiffer fit her role very well. Robert Loggia I have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell. Other than Pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances. Everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there. They did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough.Brian De Palma did a very good job directing this movie. Whenever an actor is able to become larger than life with his performance some credit should be given to the director and I will certainly give De Palma that. Brian De Palma, though not given the respect, is a very versatile director by my count. He knows how to direct movies according to their genres, but that at times has not turned out well. In here it does, this is by all counts a gangster movie but few are much better than this one because of De Palma.The writing was great it was just pure Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone had written this I was not the least bit surprised. That is a testament to him though. I have always though of him as a great writer and to me he proves this once again with Scarface. Nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than Oliver Stone.The music was good but not that great. It is certainly not my favorite from Giorgio Moroder. The music was a little bit too 80s-ish for me but it didn't annoy me. The cinematography was good, not amazing but really who cares with a movie like this.This has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons. People should realize that the character of Tony Montana is no hero, he is a monster. He is not inspiring in anyway. He is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated and self consumed. Yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster. A vigilante would be like Mother Tereasa next to Scarface.The good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the Tony Montanas' are not the real problem. If we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don't. In a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society. He is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it. The Tony Montanas' of this world are the scapegoats of our society. This in no way excuses people like him. Instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn't excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer. I love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie, it is a movie that in a strange way makes you self reflect.",Scarface

289,Manthorpe,Tides of greed.,10,29 June 2004,"One of my favorite films of all time.Tony Montana and his friend Manny have come to Miami from Cuba as political refugees in the early '80's....to take over the cocaine empire and rule the world. Quite simply, the story is about greed, excess, power, and violence....ahhh the American Dream. Al Pacino pulls out all his skills and gives his performance of his lifetime here, he becomes Tony Montana, literally. Quite simply, one of the best acting performances I've seen, if not the very best. How he nailed that accent is a mystery to me, and while it's convincing, it's also completely hilarious! There are more quotable lines for this film than any film, period. How some people do not enjoy Pacino in this film completely baffles me, although much of the discontent for this film comes from the fact that he has an accent, and I think some just have a hard time getting used to it. Without the accent, I don't believe I'd like it as much. He's just one bad mofo.The story itself is fairly simple, rising to the top can be just as fast as dropping to the bottom. And even everything in the world can't make some people happy, when by all rights it should. Filmed in the '80's, it is unmistakably hard to ignore. The clothes, music and cars have the decade of excess written all over them, which is perfect for this film in particular. And just like the '80's themselves, Scarface screams of excess as Tony quickly rises to the top of the drug empire. No one stays on top forever.
Although not a mob movie, one of the best damn gangster movies made. Ridiculously highly recommended.",Scarface
290,sc8031,Not someone I'd bring to dinner,8,14 September 2008,"'Scarface' is a strangely alluring movie. The film is held together by Al Pacino's charismatic performance, the ostentatious '80s design and sets, and a dirge-like synthesizer soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder. Al Pacino's portrayal is really wonderful, giving an extreme amount of depth to an emotional, desperate character and helps the film redefine and brutally modernize the crime genre. Scarface chronicles the rise of Tony Montana, a Cuban criminal who immigrates to Miami in the early '80s and gradually attains influence in the drug trade. Tony's rise in the drug trade is interesting because it is the only avenue for his ambition. As a second-class citizen, an uneducated Cuban in 1980s America, Tony immediately realizes he will go nowhere working a 9-5 vending job. We watch him and his best friend work their way through gruesome early jobs and earn the respect of their coked-up drug boss. Of course, you can guess where the story goes since it has become so famous in modern film.There is a distinct contrast between Pacino's role here and in the Godfather films. This film is long, but the pacing is fairly continuous. There's even a montage (gotta have a montage!) at the beginning of the second half of the film to cover a long span of time really quickly. At times the film can feel draining because the drawn-out dialogs are often about such greedy, shallow, or heated personal topics -- or they just descend into Tony's uncanny ability to curse up a storm. Especially in the second half of the film, when Tony's personal vendettas and passive-aggressive traits become exacerbated by substance abuse. There are certainly a few twists in the plot, but they are somewhat predictable and simply have to do with Tony's bursts of anger. This is sometimes boring because the self-destructive nature of characters like Tony has been covered with greater depth by more succinct films ('Raging Bull', 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God'), so Scarface sometimes becomes something of an aesthetic experience. But then again, the aesthetics are so highly appealing: a flashy portrayal of Cuban subculture in early '80s Miami.I'm not sure if this film is quite as focused as the later Pacino/De Palma movie, 'Carlito's Way'. That one has a better sense of narration and features characters who are less distant. It gets to the point more quickly. But Scarface is completely unique. Scarface places the whole American dream within a newly interpreted context. Tony comes to America and works his way to the top through the only path that is open to him. It changed crime films forever and did something totally new with the classic rags-to-riches tale. Influential, ultra-violent, and interestingly admired in modern pop-culture.",Scarface
291,nafps,The Worst Acting Pacino Ever Did,4,15 February 2021,"Pacino's accent is so bad, bands have put out whole albums mocking it, with titles like Fush Yu Mang. It's still the gold standard for awful, awful accents, right up there with Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins.The depictions of Cubans was so offensive and stereotypical, Miami wouldn't let it be made there.Pacino isn't the only ethnic impersonator. Stephen Bauer, Manny the best friend, is the only Cuban in this entire film:F Murray Abraham-Jewish, awful accent. ""Di ha maaay!"" instead of Digame!
Mary Mastrantonio-Italian, and sounds it.
Robert Loggia-Italian. His attempt at a Cuban accent is just to growl.Several other actors are Mexicans playing Cubans with not even any attempt to sound Cuban. To non Latinos, seemingly they can't tell the difference. But to Latinos it's as a ridiculous as having Stallone play a guy from Georgia.So why do many people love this film? It's an over the top cartoon. There's zero attempt at realism. The same audience that thinks gangster rap is ""real"" or actually doesn't care, so long as it gives them an excuse to wallow in violence.If you want to believe snorting coke means you can survive 30 bullets to the chest and belly, this is your film. If you want anything else, it's not for you.",Scarface
292,tyranid_slayer,My new favourite movie? Hell yes!!!!,10,3 July 2007,Scarface. I had known the basic plot-line and the reputation that precedes it. I just recently bought the DVD and sat in and watched it hoping for a very good movie.And it was. It was quite clearly drawn out. Which was quite good because it was meant to show the rise and fall of a Cuban drug lord.The acting from Al Pacino was top notch as you would come to expect. And most violence is kept to a very tame minimum. The movies direction is very good as you begin to see Tony Montana collapse in on himself and lose his mind.This movie as you might know got very negative reviews when it came out but only now has become a cult classic.A top-notch gangster movie sure to please.,Scarface
293,vvanpo,Pacino Vortex,8,8 August 2004,"21 years after release, I finally seize the opportunity to watch ""Scarface"" in its entirety.  It's all about Pacino.  He's why I rated it as high as 8 stars and he's why I rated it as low as 8 stars.  With the direction of Brian de Palma and the script of Oliver Stone, the stars align to allow Pacino to blaze like a meteor.But oh that accent!  ""Scarface"" was made long enough ago that many of the roles of Latin characters were filled by Italian-American actors which of course includes Pacino.  I have a co-worker who occasionally affects an accent (he's of Mexican heritage himself) to get laughs. I discovered he got it from Pacino here.But Pacino can't be denied his use of the f-word.  In fact, it should be decreed that only Al Pacino can say the f-word.  With ""Scarface"" and continuing with fare like ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and ""Heat"", no one can bark the f-word as juicily as Al Pacino.",Scarface
294,jcooloti,Perfect gangster film capturing 1983.,10,20 April 2021,"This is one of the greatest remakes ever made, and one of the best gangster flicks ever produced. A lot of people act ""too coo"" for this movie or think it's beneath them, why? I don't know. It rocks. If you claim to love gangster films and don't like this movie, then you must hate the 80s or Miami... something. I dunno. It captures early 80s Miami in a way that we now, time and time again try to emulate in other stories. This is a LEGENDARY film.DePalma knocks this thing out of the park in my opinion. It's a long movie, but it doesn't feel long at all. It's perfectly paced. Every scene is perfectly mapped out and the cinematography is incredible. The synthy original score is AMAZING, PERFECT and incredibly satisfying. The pop songs of the era are perfectly placed... The montage to ""Take it to the Limit"" is my favorite montages of all time... right up there with Rocky. I loved how when this film was on VHS, the second tape began with the montage.Al Pacino. Wow. Okay, normally I'm not into a white guy playing a different ethnicity... but let's face it. He's so damn good man. He looks the damn part and his accent is so amazing and good it cracks me up, because the transformation is incredible... at least to me it is. Can you imagine anyone else in this role? I sure as hell can't. It's my favorite Al Pacino performance, hands down. And this guy has acted in some of the best films ever made. Let's face it, this performance is so intense and fantastic that people literally grow up quoting his dialogue without even having seen the film or knowing where it's from.I hate to get a little political here, but I find it really sad that a film like this could never be made today in 2021. Hollywood would find a way to muck it all up, afraid they'd be stepping on too many toes. And they would be stepping on toes, and I completely understand people cringing while being offended... but a movie is a movie, and Scarface from 1983 is SOLID entertainment for anyone that's a fan of the gangster genre. Look past it's lack of political correctness and just let the film take you on the ride. Throw your hands up and take the dive. Honestly, if you're a politically correct person, why the hell are you watching a brutal gangster film like Scarface anyway? Can you imagine a politically correct gangster film? Has it ever been done, and if so, has it been done well? Doubt it. Just the thought of that... yikes. If you're too dense to censor yourself from films like this, do us all a favor and stop trying to censor it for people that are able to handle it. I'm a pretty left wing guy, but this a story, not a way to live your life...One thing that really bugs me about this movie though is the huge part of its fan base that holds Tony as a false idol. I mean, come on, Tony Montana is NOT a role model. Duh! This is a cautionary tale, not model on how to live your life... and if you are aspiring to be like Tony Montana then I'm sorry, you're a fool and probably bordering on psychopathy or a greedy and warped sense of the American dream. Get with the program.Okay, now that's out of the way. I'll just leave you all with this. Go see this movie. I hope you enjoy it. If it offends you, maybe go watch some Netflix or something. They don't make them like this anymore, and I think that's a shame.",Scarface

Al Pacino's great performance made me sympathise, as well as hate his character. He was psychotic but also pitiful.

303,andrewburgereviews,"Money, power, women--in that order",10,26 August 2019,"Al Pacino's Tony Montana is one of the most iconic movie characters ever. A flamboyant, self-glorifying man whose only purpose in life is to absorb more of the world onto himself. In doing so, he adopts a paranoid, antagonistic attitude--he views himself as a prey in a jungle of predators and his plan is to turn the table on everyone. Is Pacino's greatest performance--Montana feels like a parody of himself.Like Icarus, Brian De Palma's protagonist rises too fast too soon. His hunger is insatiable. Among the movie's many quotable lines, one which defines his greed more than anything is his conversation with his long-time friend, Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer). Unlike Tony, Manny is happy with being the middle-man in the mob world. Not Tony--he wants ""the world chico, and everything in it"". This timeless sentence emphasizes his obsession. It basically says the same thing twice because he wants to make it clear. Bluntness is his most well-defined trait. A man who cannot lie. He does not hide from the problems, does not solve them, he destroys them, wipes them from existence.The first few scenes depicts the more factual elements of the plot. In the early 80's, Fidel Castro briefly allowed inhabitants to leave his country. It was a good way for him to empty his prisons. Among the usual clean citizens, there were also men like Tony Montana. As soon as he is released into the city of Miami, we are exposed to the town's duality. An exotic, neon-sprinkled utopia, but as we get closer to the ground, we are exposed to its rotten core--a drug cartel infested temptation. The score, by the great Giorgio Moroder is yet again, luxurious, denoting a land of opportunity yet one that while offers you all the worldly pleasures in the world, takes away from you everything else.As Tony makes his way to the top, he works for a local drug lord, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Whereas Tony's friend, Manny, is happy and feels fulfilled to simply be part of the world, Tony never lets his guard down. He is observant, plotting ahead, as he feels like an impenetrable wall, a man who despite the promises given to him by others, only listens to the voice inside his head. ""Who do I trust? Me!"" When Tony lays his eyes for the first time on Lopez's bored trophy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) he repeats again and again that she'll be his (even to her own face) and by his attitude you get the impression he can pull it off as, indeed, he does.Frank likes to be a mentor to Tony, and so he spills out some beginner's guide to vagabonding lines: ""Rule number one: don't underestimate the other guy's greed. Rule number two: don't get high on your own supply"". The first rule was never a problem for Tony as he seems to be naturally tense. He is always looking, always watching. Even when he is engaged in business talks, he always looks around him. Paranoia would be a drawback for any person but Brian De Palma created such a convincing criminal underworld that for Tony is more of a positive trait--everyone around him relaxes now and then; he never does and you feel safer for that. The second rule he breaks over and over again. The movie's most powerful scenes come from seeing Tony surrounded by cocaine, alcohol, succumbing to their control.But there is more. During a heated argument between Tony and Frank, he also warns Tony about making too many moves, He tells him that if he wants to last, he needs to be more tactical. Yet in the end it is not Tony's caustic attitude that ruins him, but his humanity. If you seen the film, you know what I mean-- the scene in which he is sent to assassinate a journalist who's been snooping around is the only time Tony breaks his own rule and lets his guard down, not putting business first. His humanity is also seen as he interacts with his mother and sister especially in one particular homecoming scene. He made it, he tells his mother but she is not impressed and soon he realizes how little ""made it"" means. In one great scene in a restaurant he rants about the emptiness coming with money, power and women--always in that order. It might be the only scene in which the average Joe can relate as he realizes that all the expectations and eagerness coming with climbing the road to success are gone away once you get to the top and they are replaced with... nothing.The year was 1983. Brian De Palma created what is arguably the father of all macho action films. This might not be something to brag about but ""Scarface"" remains a landmark piece of cinema for the way it juggled so many taboos in an era when those taboos were not cliche. It is a nearly three-hour movie in which excess, greed, hatred, ego and violence are increasing at an exponential rate. It closer at a progressively increasing rate to an inevitable end.",Scarface
304,jason_13,Classic!,10,13 February 2006,"Scarface is definitely in the top 100 movies ever made. Not my top 100, but overall and I don't agree with its place at the Top 250. It's a movie about almost anything. There are quite a few movies like it, but Scarface is something special. If it didn't come out between movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas, I am sure it would have been even a more special movie. We have a really interesting character. Tony Montana who is involved with the drugs business. Nervous, eccentric, strange, funny. Something from everything. I assume that Al Pacino is the only actor that could play such a person. He was chosen for best actor of all time and this movie made his name gold since it was silver after The Godfather. At least this is my opinion on Pacino's career. Stunning performance. Of course the movie is much more than ""Woah, Pacino rules"", but he is the highlight like Hanks in Forrest Gump, Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs, Depp in Ed Wood. You know what I mean.So the movie has other colorful and interesting characters which brought a great atmosphere to the movie. Such as Michelle Pfeiffer's heroine who is Montana's wife in the later period of the movie, some infamous for me names did a great performance, such as Tony's friends and his sister.Brian De Palma's best movie and Stone's script are NO 2 most important thing. Really tremendous writing by Stone who has had drug problems at that time. Really interesting story around him and Scarface. After Scarface, he has written many scripts of some classic movies such as Platoon. The relation between Montana and his sister is very well made and most of all realistic. Other screenwriter wouldn't have paid any attention on such thing when he has Pacino, great drug story, action and great lines. De Palma's direction is remarkable. The chainsaw scene was nicely directed. The very last scene - classic. The movie stresses on many human nature issues. Such as Montana's self confidence, prejudices, trust, friends. Many scenes show what is trust between Tony and his friends. The cliché about when a man becomes rich, he becomes a bad person is created delightful. Tony's power over other people make him degrade and that is where the movie becomes much more than a typical mob drama/crime. The action scenes are great addition to the great story, but I find them rather being a great bonus then something the movie wouldn't have managed without.The score -perfect. Without stoppage, I say the score is something special. It fits in the movie in a unique way. I don't know how many times I have used a positive word in this review, but the movie deserves it. I really loved it and respected it.There will never be another movie like Scarface although this comes from the mouth of a person who prefers prefers Goodfellas to Scarface. Great director, one of the greatest actor of all time although far from my personal favorite and remarkable writer who is one big, big man and by big I don't mean size. Respect for Oliver Stone. If I had to describe the movie with one word, it would have been classic without any doubt. Scarface:10/10",Scarface

306,Aditya_Gokhale,"""You wanna play rough?? OKAY!""",10,19 December 2005,"""Scarface"" has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind 'The Godfather'.But it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as ""tackiness"" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the ""remake""! Al Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time!There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's theme', 'Push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental.There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother's.About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what ""Scarface"" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn't be as effective without him!Steven Bauer shines as Tony's friend Manny.Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.Then there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.""Scarface"" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!",Scarface
307,bulleetz37235,A true cult classic that will go down in history,9,31 August 2005,"Pacino brilliant. DePalma damn good. From the pen of Oliver Stone. And backed up by some of the most shocking and memorable scenes ever committed to the big screen. It's a long one but still holds tough all the way through. It uses cheesy soundtracks to great effect, and backs up the carnage with glimpses of sentimentality, such as when Pacino (who plays the hard gangster Tony 'scarface' Montana) goes to see his family, and when he makes a stand in not blowing up the target car, because a woman and some children are inside, Sure he does actually resort to shooting his 'compadre' in the face, but it is admirable and a rather weak side that shows when he decides not to let the woman and her kids die. The fact this film manages to alternate between hardcore gore fests and compassionate scenes such as these means that there is more depth to the film, this depth is what holds a viewer in their seat. If it was just a three hour shoot 'em up, or just some three hour long romance epic it would really ruin it. Well thank god the makers got the mix just right and I can only really say two things about this film and that is. 1) It is Fantastic and 2)Everybody must watch it.",Scarface
308,jmverville,Sympathizing with the Bad Man,7,20 October 2004,"This film has been endlessly parodied and quoted, and we have seen the repercussions in it in most all parts of our culture -- all for a reason... It is quite an epic, intriguing film focusing around an incredibly magnetic, motivated main character.In many ways one of the best portrayals of 'man against the world,' we sympathize with the political refugee from the beginning until the end, and begin to understand and see the world through his eyes. The genius of the film is that, in addition to being an action film, it does not seem to take on the necessity of most other action films of establishing the main character as an unquestionable hero, but rather it forces the audience to see themselves in and to sympathize with a gangster and a coke dealer. It demands of the audience to see things from another perspective, and to enter another man's world & reality, unlike your typical action film.This is one of the better epics put to film -- I would recommend this to anyone, in general, being quite a complete study of the human condition.",Scarface
309,Nobody-27,Not as great as it is lauded to be,3,21 April 2018,"I saw Scarface when it first came out, and then again some 35 years later. Through all those years only few images from that film stayed with me - mostly how gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer was/is. This did not compare favorably to other great films which I remember to great detail, and upon watching it again recently, I found out why.
First of all, the main character, well portrayed by Al Pacino is far from an interesting of likeable character. His love of violence, dirty money and drugs may be attractive to some, but even when I was much younger, I found him entirely forgettable. There was not much reason to root for him, or even feel for him. ""A dumb, violent newcomer with (almost) no morals gets in trouble? Let's see what's on other channels...""
Then there is the story which is entirely predictable. What can happen to a violent criminal other than violence? And that's what happens. Unless you like watching violence in all it's bloody glory, you don't get anything from watching this film.
And then the story itself, or whatever story there is, is painfully long - overstretched to saga proportions to give it some weight.
In the end, between all the ""f"" bombs, low-brow action and dialogues, and characters destined for self-destruction, I fail to see where the attraction that this film enjoys comes from. In a way, I think the audiences have been had by their own penchant for cheap thrills.
Shock value? Sure. Blood and foul language? Galore. But artistic merit or inspirited storytelling with strong characters? Not even close. This is one of those films that managed to garner praise despite it's lack of quality on all fronts, except for decent acting. Oh, and don't get me started on terrible music score... it only made the film age terribly, although it's age shows even without the score. As I was watching it, I could not help but think of much older films which managed to stay fresh, films such as ""M"" by Fritz Lang or ""Rififi"" by Jules Dassin. Heck, even lighter fare such as ""Pehlam 123"" holds much better over time than this overrated, pretentious piece of sub-par, cheap ""entertainment"", for lack of better word.
All in all, a forced three star. I had to watch something afterwards just to detox from the bad experience that left me wondering why did I even waste my time on it in the first place, when even on the first viewing in the theater, back in the 80's, I was not terribly impressed.",Scarface

Although movie is 2 hours and 50 mins long,but you will not find any dull moment in the movie.Alhough Al Pacino is playing a drug dealer but you will still like him as a person.Dialogues were excellent and there were couple of good songs in movie too.I also liked the way in which Al Pacino's character used to flirt with Michelle Pfeiffer's character.It was funny sometimes and was gentle too.This is indeed a work which belongs up there with all the 8.5 out of 10.",Scarface

Depending on how you at this character and his achievements he is either a great man who worked hard to become the Kingpin of crime or an unfortunate cook who has a lot of reasons to hate Castro. What is indisputable though is that the viewer finds themselves caught up in his world and rooting for him against the obviously more deranged Cartels who are even worse than him.

318,Instant_Palmer,"Poorly Directed, Poorly Written, Miserable Soundtrack",1,17 October 2017,"One of the most overrated films of all time, Scarface is simply a ""hot mess"".The film throws cliché after cliché at the audience, with frequent awkward over-acting moments - Responsibility for all this falls squarely on the Director...after ricocheting off the Screenwriter's desk.Before Oliver Stone tackled the rewrite of the originally written 1932 script, he famously moved to Paris to quit his cocaine habit.Before Brian DePalma was brought aboard to direct, Sidney Lumet was hired as the Director, inducing Stone to come in to handle screenwriting duties. However, when Lumet read Stone's work, he quit.De Palma's Untouchables was his best film - this is his worst film. The only similarity between the two films is the soundtrack - occasionally annoying in the Untouchables, it drones through Scarface, adding to one's misery in trying to endure the film. Perhaps an attempt to fill in those frequent awkward scenes.The script fails on every level - Oliver Stone's Wall Street released 4 years later is a work of genius - Scarface a work of an amateur. I know high school writers who can put out better work.Add in fake looking bright red blood, and actors getting shot who fall/die like B Movie actors in the 1950s, and you have a complete mess.Not wasting anymore time on this review - Scarface is an all-time Turkey/Bomb.",Scarface

Of course, the seed already has to be there, and as Pacino shows, Montana is hungry. He's a big fish wannabe, and his climb to the top of the pile is what you'd imagine a young Jimmy Cagney to have been like had there been a prelude to White Heat.Insanely quotable, Pacino has recently been voted number one greatest actor of all time in some dodgy poll, well, I don't believe you can measure one kind of genius against another, but if it came down to it, it's performances like this that hold him up as The Daddy.

It's like Jimi Hendrix - he more than often missed a note or two or played with a off-tuned guitar, but when something so powerful and original hits you, you're just dazzled and left speechless in amazement.In Scarface, you get a triple treat: Al Pacino in 101% form, Brian de Palma with some incredible directing and the utter original, real and razor-sharp screenplay of Oliver Stone. Method acting by Pacino works here like a firecracker - it broke any kind of consciousness in me that I was after-all watching an illusion, it took me from my seat and inserted me mentally in the action. That end scene is something else...""You f**** with me, you're f****** with da best"".In a top ten of memorable quotes packed movies, this one will definitely be in the first 5. ""I kill communists for fun"". How much complexity in a simple line - it is drama,humor,mindless lack of morality, and the list can go on.

M., which I usually find annoying. F.Murray A. has a small role, but effective and Steven Bauer does exactly what his character is supposed to be doing. It is pointless to say that the movie would have been less without Pacino, who shines like the sun in this one. His performance could be placed alongside any major work of art and belong there 100%.""In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you make the money, you get the power.

327,tvspace,The Rocky Horror Gangster Show,5,22 February 2005,"I went into Scarface expecting a searing gangster drama to stand up next to classics like Goodfellas, The Godfather, and Carlito's Way. Instead the movie is an over-the-top, operatic melodrama that is only shy a bunch of costumed hecklers to make it into the next Rocky Horror Picture Show. I found the disclaimer at the end -- that not *all* Cuban-Americans were like those depicted in the movie -- to be perhaps the most ridiculous aspect of the whole presentation, as much so as if one alerted the audience after Godzilla that not *all* lizards were bent on the destruction of major Japanese cities. In other words - no kidding!From a stylistic perspective the movie is badly dated, with the Giorgio Moroder score occupying a particularly glaring spot in the finished film as being an unfortunate product of a not-very-lamented bygone era -- a musical Land of the Lost awash in obsolete synthesizers and peculiarly unfunky rhythms. While we can't entirely blame the film for being made at a nadir of American culture, which 1983 undoubtedly was in some respects, the bottom line is that Miami Vice did a better job of integrating the same cultural artifacts into some fun-to-watch television, and that isn't really saying all that much.Despite these criticisms, the movie is not unenjoyable to sit through. For me, in its guileless employment of mid-80's cultural flotsam, it became a sort of time machine to that era. At first you are sitting there cringing at what you are seeing, but then you remember: people dug this movie when it was new, and in believing that you are forced to take a trip back to a time when the bell-like sounds of DX7 synthesizers and blow-dried hair were actually *cool*. You remember that movies are made to be watched immediately, and anything we can get out of them 20 years down the road is more of an unintended consequence of conducting anthropology via the art-house cinema.And there's still a few moments in the film which just plain work: ""You wanna job?"" ""Say hello to my little friend..."" and others. In moments like these you sense the seeds of the Sopranos and other gangster movies with a extra large helping of attitude. In the end, though, Scarface is a campy journey into a dead-end aesthetic of polyester and pop-up headlights. It isn't so much documenting excess as it is an example of excess itself. I wouldn't be surprised in 20 years to go see it as a midnight movie and find a bunch of teenagers hurling toilet paper and insults at the screen in gleeful fits of postmodern revelry.",Scarface

This film follows the classic story of the rise of and of an American gangster in the same vain as The Public Enemy, Little Ceaser and GoodFellas. Montana's success is the American Dream gone wrong. Throughout the whole movie we as the viewer want Montana to succeed and fail. He's an awful person but he has his moments of heroism that make us still care about him. Director Brian De Palma and writer Oliver Stone made a film that broke down barriers and was not afraid to take risks.

AS a kid, I was obsessed with the Untouchables television series too, never missed an episode. But, I have never liked this movie! The reason I don't like this is due to the way the main character is presented. All I see in this version's mobster character is some murderous sicko whom is in love with his sister, Gina (Mastrantonio). Then throughout the movie, Tony Montana (Pacino) makes one dumb decision after another because he thinks he's ""too big"" for the world and doesn't have to listen to ""nobody."" Montana is inevitably gunned down for his decisions in the famous ""say hello to my little friend"" scene. Now I'll go back and break down the plot points of this movie so that hopefully someone else in this world will see my reasoning as to why this movie is no good and overrated:Small mobster rises to power. Everyone does cocaine. People die. The main character and his friends kill some more people and have fornication with lots of women. The mobsters do more drugs.Small guy becomes big mobster and kills his loyal friend (Bauer) for making a move on Gina, then finds that he didn't just kill his best friend, but his now brother-in-law. Sister; Gina sees that her brother is in love with her. Tony does more coke and IT hits the fan.Small-big mobster is gunned down and takes almost everyone with him. Then the movie ends like a Shakespearean tragedy, only with more bullets.So here's a guy into incest, into drug addiction, who is paranoid and he is burdened by a Neapolitan complex too. And I won't even touch on how he makes Colombians look either, but I will mention that the original idea of Scarface was a modern day Robin Hood born and second generation America, who is sucked into the wrong type of life. This character was meant to me based on mostly the life of Al Capone. Montana was only similar on the surface, while Camonte from the 1932 original played by Paul Muni was clearly based on Capone. This does not mean to that for me to be a satisfied viewer I had to see a total remake word-for-word. But there are some things you don't twist such as real facts about a character from a book. Especially when the facts are based on a real person. When that is done, it's practically distorting history. Example: say that they made a movie about Sigmund Freud, without pointing out that someone tried to in 1984. The father of psychology comes up with many concepts. The ideas inspire others such as Jung and Adler to take the inspirational concepts and make them into psychiatry legend. Before this one Jewish man used his ""theories"" to make the human mind a more comfortable place, the cranium was simply a mystery that no one would touch. Then, instead of making a movie like that, someone, let's call the writer Olive Stoner, decides to make a movie about a man who was in love with his mother, robbed rich women based on ""oddball"" theories that his equals mocked, and the little man snorted cocaine all the live long day and was rude to everyone around him while demanding individuals refer to him as ""Genius"" or Dr. Freud. Stoner throws in a few catchy lines, some Hollywood eye-candy, two tommy-guns, and then calls it a day. The movie makes millions, kids buy the action figures, and everyone is happy, right? No. To write a character, you need more than a scar on a face, you need to show the other side of his face too and the freaking backside. When playing with a character that someone else created, you can't rip it apart and make 'em something else entirely while keeping the title ""Mob"" in your idea.So Stone's adaptation of this character was overrated by the public. Now, the character Camonte in the original was not a simple guy that you could describe as ""just this"" and as ""just that."" There was a lot to that mobster, in fact the writer Ben Hecht studied and analyzed real mobsters for the film and even had real historical moments within based on Al Capone's life. Plus, unlike Stone, Hecht actually read the book Scarface that Armitage Trail wrote in 1929 and he worked with the writer. Montana on the other hand was two-dimensional and clearly based on a rewritten screenplay of the 1932 film.",Scarface

A finale which defies logic and credibility?  Certainly `Scarface' is one of the worst movies of all time. A lot of people get their guts blown away, but so what?  How about a few interesting characters?  A story line that is at least halfway believable? Is this too much to ask?",Scarface
334,anthonymichaelbangert,Not a Fan,6,15 February 2015,"I am not a fan of this film. It is the story of Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee in America (everything he says about Cuba read like propaganda). In Cuba he was an assassin of sorts, but in America he could be whoever he wanted to. Unfortunately, he immediately gets wrapped up in the Cocaine Distribution business through a friend. Tony moves his way up the ladder too quickly, breaking rules and making enemies left and right, even as he gains power and money. This movie had so many flaws in it. I just could not like it. I know it is a classic, and well received, but not by this man.Soundtrack: 8- The soundtrack was decent, nothing too exciting, it didn't add anything to the movie. But it wasn't bad.Script: 2- I think this is the movie's biggest flaw. The script itself reads like the man who wrote it was on Coke when he did it. The dialogue was broken, and didn't make sense most of the time. When it did make sense, it was so shallow and one-dimensional that it still was bad. The writer seemed like he tried to throw in bits of humor to cut through the movie's intensity. It was a good idea, and the only reason I'm not grading this at a 1.Originality: 8- Gangster movies have been done many times over. But this one was pretty unique. Predictable, but unique.Cinematography: 7- The cinematography in this movie was OK. The camera-work gave good angles and such. But there was nothing that really made it great. Just sort of generic.Casting: 6- So many choices in this movie did not work. Especially Al Pacino. Sure, he's a great actor, but if you are doing a movie about Cubans, don't cast an Italian in the main role.Acting: 5- Al Pacino's facial expressions. Seriously... Also, the rest of the actors seemed to be trying hard, but it is hard to act when you have such a terrible script to use.Overall: 6",Scarface
335,DesertDogMedia,Scarface,7,12 August 2014,"Title: ScarfaceCondensed Storyline: A Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel and soon becomes the top dog, but lets his greed take over him. Notable Acting: Al Pacino plays our favourite Cuban drug lord, Tony Montana. His performance it the driving force of this movie. Mainly because the movie is based on him, so if his performance went flat that movie would fall flat as well. Overall Feel: I have a feeling this is going to be a short review, I'll just put that out there right now. This movie is basically the ""Zero to hero"" plot, but tipped on its head a bit. As Tony is a downright criminal, so I do say that the movie is a very interesting case for that. The movie also practices what it preaches as throughout the whole movie you see him moving up in the world, getting the money, then the power, then the woman. Before losing it all because his good honest morals get in the way. I can say that I am generally not a big fan of mafia based movies, but this is a movie which I enjoyed regardless.",Scarface

337,Lt_Coffey_182,Icon,10,9 October 2005,"One of the most iconic films there has ever been, Scarface requires little introduction. A colourful, explicit tale of one man's journey from flipping burgers to the world being his, Scarface is, behind the Godfather, the best gangster film ever made.Al Pacino is Tony Montana and plays the ambitious, ruthless Cuban gangster to perfection. At times, his accent is a bit off but the performance is now legendary and deservedly so. Martin Bregman knew Pacino well, thus knew how to make Montana a 'shoe-in' part for Pacino. Pacino's passionate performance ignites the film to life and immediately grabs the audience's attention. His charisma makes Montana a likable character in spite of his actions. Scarface is possibly Pacino's most famous role and with his career, that says a lot. Steve Bauer is excellent as Manny Ray, Montana's sidekick. The look of the character and the sleazy personality fantastically portrays the stereotype that Americans had of Cubans at the time the film was made. Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Robert Loggia are also very effective in support.Stone did a great job with the screen play and imprints his legacy on the film. There seem to be plenty of political stabs during this film which Stone is famous for but they fit in due to the situation arising from politics. If Stone had directed too, however, I suspect the film may have been drowned with politics. Scarface proved a great building block in Stone's career, leading him to make Salvador a few years later. De Palma does a great job with the action scenes and fills the senses with colour, noise and bad language. Possibly too much bad language, to the point where the 'f' word loses its power. The only down point of the film is the soundtrack. It is very 80s and is the only thing that risks making the film appear dated.The film makes an example out of Montana for breaking the rules of the crime underworld. Getting high off his own supply, underestimating Sosa, he was warned but ignored all advice thinking he was indestructible. One of the best aspects of the film is how over the top some of it is, it withdraws the audience's sense of reality, only to bring them back down to earth with a bang at the end.Scarface is one of the best films ever made, despite being slightly overshadowed by Pacino. A true classic!",Scarface
338,Preston-10,Sing when your losing! Spoilers.,1,6 July 2002,"Lately I've felt drawn to long violent epics dealing with crime (Once Upon a Time in America, The Godfather, Goodfellas). Even though I don't think Scarface holds up to those movies I still think it succeeds at a level where the Howard Hawks movie didn't. I can't think of another person who could of played this role better than Al Pacino, and yes, that does include Paul Muni. I don't think it's a coincidence that the filmmakers chose the same person who played Michael Corleone. Both characters are bad, use violence for personal gain, and are incredibly human. Maybe it strays away in the famous final scene when Tony Montana is riddled by a swarm of bullets, not to mention the scene where a stoned-out Pacino inhales a mountain of cocaine on his desk. Still, Tony Montana is one of those characters that stays with you despite the fact that he's a monster that would kill a person at the drop of a hat, and drop the hat himself. The violence in Scarface is not there to entertain, but as a way to reinforce the self-destruction of Montana; so when it does get to that point where you see a crowd of people overwhelm Montana's mansion, you know that there's no way he's going to get out of this one. I'm not really use to seeing DePalma's work outside of his well-known thriller movies like Dressed to Kill and Sisters. Still, He's a master at building up suspense.",Scarface

340,medic249a2,One of Pacino's finest roles,7,10 September 2006,"This one had so much about the 1980s it's hard to know where to start. I remember when this one came out & was getting rave reviews; I wanted to see it badly but my parents always said ""no way"" as they were very strict about these kinds of movies. However, 2 years later I was finally able to watch it for the first time with my dad. It left an impression that has stuck with me since then.Pacino is at one of his best roles here; admittedly he is over-the-top sometimes but that is also part of the character. As others have remarked he is not playing a Corleone-type gangster here; he is playing a violent drug dealer that gradually replaced the gangster-types of Corleone & even Al Capone. The supporting cast is solid as well; Robert Loggia, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio & Steve Bauer are all excellent performers.Some of the scenes, especially the infamous chainsaw scene, are disturbing, although the violence in the drug underworld is arguably more extreme than in the times of Al Capone or Michael Corleone. Oliver Stone's screenplay gets dull in places; while it does tell a good story, I got tired of hearing the F-word in almost every line. One does expect a fair amount of swearing from these characters in order to make them believable; however the extreme use of the F-word made the dialog lag in places.Brian DePalma is a solid director; while this is not his best effort by far, it is fine work just the same. He followed up this effort with another gangster film - 'The Untouchables' - four years later, which portrayed the 'classic' images of the early 30's gangsters. Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas' also fit the mold of the 'crime family' gangsters. 'Scarface' certainly dispelled the traditional movie stereotypes of the gangster lifestyle; it showed that it is gritty, messy, and frequently outright savage.This one is the movie that got me interested in Pacino's films; his finest since this one was his role on the other side of the law in 'Heat', playing an intense Los Angeles policeman.This 1983 classic is terrific viewing for those who grew up in the 1980s. However, I would strongly advise anyone with a weak stomach or nerves to avoid it - it is EXTREMELY graphic!",Scarface

342,bellabanana93,One Of Al Pacino's Best Performances: Tony Montana/Scarface Has A Unique and Classic Accent That Everyone Quotes,9,25 October 2017,"Scarface (1983) is a Crime Drama starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana. This film is set in Miami in 1980 and is 2 hours and 50 minutes long. Tony Montana is determined to run his own drug business. He is impatient and wants money and power and he is ready to do whatever it takes. But, it is a dangerous business? Will he manage to take over or will blow it all? I thought that Al Pacino's performance was the highlight of the film. Al Pacino plays the character of Tony Montana marvellously which makes this one of the most quotable movies ever. If you are one of those people who has not seen Scarface but as heard people quoting it all the time, as soon as you watch Scarface you will understand why people fell in love with the character of Tony Montana with his iconic 'scarface' look. Pacino starts off nervous and unknowing about the industry and ends up doing crazy things. It doesn't take long before he is putting his life on the line and carrying drugs around and selling them, risking the chance of jail time. This movie is great because of all of the intense action scenes which are incredibly gory and trilling paired with the fantastic and memorable acting! I would recommend this film to lovers of the Crime Drama genre as it is a classic that has the hearts of many of us! Since there are a lot of gory scenes, references to drugs, and swear words, I would recommend this movie only be watched by older audiences.",Scarface

344,bronty,What's worse: the film or Pacino?,2,5 December 2004,"Having seen this over 20 years ago on cable, I recently decided to see if the ensuing decades could make me appreciate this, and the answer is ""NO"". I thought then, and think now, that the film overall and its lead performer were and are over-hyped to the point of hysteria. I even call into deep question Pacino's standing as one of America's ""great"" actors; for all those who love ""The Godfather"" series (I'm not one of them: I think they, too, were equally overdone), I suggest taking a gander at such ""classics"" as ""Author! Author!"" (ever wonder why he doesn't do more comedy? A quick glance at THIS will tell you why). In the hands of the unreliable De Palma - for every ""Carrie"", you get ""The Fury"" - a man who, despite his blatant desire and attempts to be Hitchcock reborn, is at heart a lover of the overblown cinematic image, Pacino is allowed to give his tiresome ticks and actor's tricks full display in a part that SHOULD have been played with subtlety. If the film is watchable - and it basically is NOT - it is due to the scenery-chewing; Pacino hardly starts with nibbling; no, instead he swallows each shot whole, inspiring his fellow actors to go overboard along with him. For each laugh one has at the actors' expense, however, one needn't be Cuban to be even slightly offended: SURELY the makers of this film could have found more than ONE honest-to-goodness Cuban (co-star Steven Bauer being it). The accents, particularly Pacino and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, are akin to those in the old ""Speedy Gonzalez"" cartoons - you almost expect poor old Juan Valdez to be trotted out, too, just for good measure. But how about the story-telling, the technical aspects? Well...once you get past the hammy performances - quite a struggle, believe me (you'll be tempted to bring out the cloves and pineapple) - and the assuredly overcooked direction, you are left with something that rambles on for nearly 3 hours, though with little reason beyond wanting to become a modern-day ""epic saga"" a la ""The Godfather"". As for the LOOK of the film, it's not an especially attractive one: the print on cable - no, I haven't seen the DVD and don't care to - STILL looks downright muddy at points, as if copied from an old slow-speed video tape, though this could be as much to do with pan-and-scan as anything else. The much-lauded score by Giorgio Moroder is, THERE: not memorable, as with ""Midnight Express"", but not a total failure and it DOES fit the cool, shiny-plastic beauty of Miami and its denizens as shown in this film (everyone seems to be dipped in either oil - the ""natural look"" apparently never made it down in Florida - or sweat, for Pacino never seems to stop perspiring, which is understandable, what with the effort it must have taken to overact AND speak with some marble-mouthed, faux-Latin accent). No matter, though, what the film looks like, or how it's written (poorly; example: Michelle Pfeiffer, sporting one of her other noses, just disappears towards the end), or how long it goes on (and on, and ON, AND ON...), people watch this for the acting, the violence, and the love of the ""f"" word (uttered 182 times), and they have dubbed this and ""The Godfather"" as ""classics"", all of which goes to show that if you say it long enough, some people believe it.",Scarface
345,the-evil-cult,Formulaic Tragedy,10,24 June 2004,"As a formulaic tragedy, Scarface manages to do quite a good job at making the viewer feel sympathy for the protagonist. Viewers will gain an insight into police corruption, an issue that has gained media attention in Melbourne lately with greater exposure of Gangland killings. Is an honorable drug lord who values the lives of children more virtuous than those who follow the law yet exploit others? The climax of Scarface resembles the apotheosis of violence witnessed in Taxi Driver. Beyond the superficialities, Taxi Driver and Scarface have much in common. Al Pacino's acting is excellent. The film focuses on Pacino's character to the point where other characters become meaningless. The ending, although satisfying, seems to suffer from a touch of contrived nihilism. Otherwise, Scarface is a great movie.10/10",Scarface
346,Arcturus1980,My favorite crime film,10,17 September 2011,"They improved on greatness for this remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 film of the same name. To my mind, this is more than a crime doesn't pay morality tale, just as Al Pacino's Tony Montana is an anti-villain rather than an anti-hero. This is deep filmmaking not to be dismissed in so superficial and parochial a manner.Plot spoilers hereunder: Tony Montana suffered under the boot of Castro in communist Cuba until joining the exodus to America thanks to President Carter's gracious, yet naive open-arms policy. When his friend Manny (Bauer) asks what's coming to him, he says: ""The world, chico, and everything in it."" Ambitious to the hilt, he refuses to eke out an honest existence amidst such wealth and opportunity. Meaning well, he endeavors to relieve his sister (Gina, Mastrantonio) and mother (Colon) of such meagerness to their corruption and indignation, respectively. Hotheaded and highly prone to excess, he wants to take care of mama and sis on the side, while braving his way to the top of Miami's cocaine empire.Other characters include Omar Suarez (Abraham), a lowlife thorn in Tony's side that is not long for the film; Frank (Loggia), a contentedly low-key operator seen as ""soft"" by Tony; Mel Bernstein (Yulin), a rat bastard cop who Frank pins on Tony after their falling out; Elvira (Pfeiffer), Frank's girlfriend turned wife of Tony; and Sosa (Shenar), a Bolivian kingpin who starts up serious business with Tony after making it clear that betrayal is not something he finds humorous. Apart from Pacino's of course, I would single out Paul Shenar's performance. Exceptional work all around, but replace Shenar and we have a problem.Tony ends up facing a few years for tax evasion, which gives Sosa leverage over him. To avoid prison on account of Sosa's government connections, he has to help take out a respectable Bolivian journalist. Not a walk in the park, but better than prison, he figures. By this time, Elvira, notwithstanding her own problems, summoned the strength to leave their toxic relationship and look for greener pastures.Paranoid and addled by a cocaine addiction, Tony remains principled, and opts to shoot dead the black-hearted sack of human garbage (Alberto, played very well by Mark Margolis) holding the detonator instead of going ahead with an assassination unexpectedly involving a wife and kids. The journalist makes a damning speech to the United Nations, and Sosa is livid with rage at the betrayal.Tony, not at all in a serene frame of mind, finds Manny living with Gina, and gut-shoots him to death like a mongrel, recalling to mind the wonderfully powerful counterpart scene in Hawks' original. Having warned womanizing Manny against such conduct, Tony was outraged by a sense of betrayal, and did not realize that their relationship (marriage) was not necessarily indecent after all. Consequently, Gina lost her mind before being machine-gunned down by one of Sosa's guys as scores of them commenced their assault. Fuelled by coke and rage, Tony returned fire with a characteristic gusto appropriate under the circumstances. He dies a bullet-riddled dramatic death in front of ""The World is Yours"" statue.Torn between a principled, yet conditional respect for life and avaricious criminality, Tony tried to compartmentalize life in a manageable way without success, least of all as it pertained to Sosa, who is not so hung up on moral quandaries. Gina and his mother would have been better off had he remained a dishwasher, but I doubt very much that he would think so of himself.We have Sidney Lumet to credit for the Cuban angle including the Mariel Boatlift. Oliver Stone obviously has a thing or two figured out to have written this masterpiece. Brian De Palma directs brilliantly. We see his Hitchcockian influence in the New York City car scene. I absolutely love synth master Giorgio Moroder's very '80s original score. All the music hits the mark. John A. Alonzo's cinematography and Bruce Weintraub's set decoration are tops. Spanish is used less than would be realistic, but this artistic license works cinematically. There is Spanish in the film, so it is not as though it went out the window.It's in my top 10.",Scarface

348,TruPretender,The Real Scarface.,10,28 January 2007,"""A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read."" -Mark Twain'Classic' seems to be the word used to describe ""Scarface"", Brian DePalma's 1983 film about opulence, self surrender, greed, and danger among Florida's drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films.' When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over, but not all the praise it gets from audiences today, and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.First off, the film is about a Cuban refugee, with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma's directing genius, and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape, as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer, that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money, but all that has a price, as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life, when in true dramatic irony, they are actually getting worse. 'Tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it's drug usage, it's violence, it's dialog, totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film, not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters, or brainless action fans.Next on, the film is an adult drama. It is not a 'gangster film'. It has it's share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point. It's not like ""Aliens""- an example of a big dumb action film, and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that, then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it. This being said, the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in ""Grease 2"" she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go. This reviewer learned one main thing when watching ""Scarface"" for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap, ignore the mindless violence supporters, and fix yourself a glass of Bailey's on the rocks, and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film, the real ""Scarface.""",Scarface

If you've enjoyed the Godfather and Braveheart and Gallipoli, which are the best movies that I've ever seen, along with Scarface, you have go to watch this movie.  Al Pacino gives a better performance than the one in the Godfather.

350,krisrox,It's lonely at the top,9,29 November 2008,"""Scarface"" has aged really well. It was deemed trashy cult twenty years ago; now, it is undoubtedly one of the landmarks of the 80s, a monster tale about outsider ambition vs. loser fatalism that handsomely beats ""Wall Street"" at its own game.Stylish and super-charged throughout, what takes ""Scarface"" to the next level is the uncanny way the movie embodies its message. In true DePalma-style the direction is way too lavish; Moroder's soundtrack borderline kitschy; Pacino's Montana so inhumanly goal-oriented we know he's really headed nowhere; and Stone's otherwise pointed script full of drawn-out scenes about seemingly nothing, effectively underlining the emptiness of his characters. (A technique that wasn't lost on Tarantino.)Yet this is not, as some have stated, a vulgar flick about vulgarity. There's a deeper layer here... Montana never smiles; he enjoys neither his violence nor his opulence; and even after his loved ones die, he doesn't gain insight. The inevitable grand finale still exceeds expectations, with DePalma & Pacino burning Rome to the ground with the grandiosity Montana deserves.Epic in every aspect, ""Scarface"" is a must-see if only because you'll feel strongly about it.",Scarface

De Palma uses some brilliant crane shots in particular - they're really intriging to watch.The editing allows us to see Tony work his way from small time imigrant up to big time crime lord.  The thing is that what he really wants to be - legitimate - is never going to happen.From the moment he murders a political prisoner for a green card we know that he is a right c*nt!  Some viewers would root for him as an anti-hero; I would say that he is an idiot - because I know that he's going to get himself killed from the beggining.By the end of the flick (spoilers!) he has managed to become a crack head, a public drunk, a drug pusher, killed his best mate ever, destroyed his sister and mother, failed in his marriage and never fathered a child.  Well done son - what a loser!To his merit he finally realises that everything he has was worthless, and the opposites of the previous list are what its all about; but by this stage his house is under siege and he's about to get his bum blown out with a double barelled shotgun.  Good!Pacino is allowed to overact with so much charm its infectious, the action scenes are top notch and the sense of danger is perfick!  A great crime-does-not-pay film.Check out the DefJam documentary on the DVD to see how idiotic some rapper are (Puff ""I've seen it 63 times"" Daddy still doesn't get it?!!! Come on lads, get with the plot!).In the words of myself ; bloody marvellous little film.  Put it on your to see list.",Scarface
352,arkif1,If you ever suffer really bad from some lasting pain...,10,30 April 2007,"...Scarface becomes one of the very, very few films indeed for which you'll still find taste watching. (Pretty much like with Parsifal in the opera business, though for slightly different reasons, as follows.)Dressed in the suit of a gangster film Scarface is in fact a frontal attack on society, pleasure and the human condition in general. The beginning sets the tone for the whole film, we see real TV coverage of Fidel Castro declaring that criminals are better off in the U.S. than in Cuba and then their shipping over to Miami.The film continues to show the veracity of this in the most cynical way imaginable, namely that Tony Montana does not only rise to the top, but that the big players in the U.S.' economical and political life even profit with him. What a waste, if he'd stayed in Cuba, on which all of his qualities would have been lost.When it comes to money laundering and the legalisation of drugs you can clearly hear the political convictions of the people behind this film. But it doesn't stop there. ""Me, I want what is coming to me."" - ""Oh well... what is coming to you?"" - ""The world, Chico, and everything in it."" You want more? Yet, what is satisfaction? How elusive is it? Can somebody, in whom there is no lying, be satisfied by means of possession? Tony can not, Tony is wrath, ebbing away when he gets trapped in settled circumstances. Irrationality as all of human's joy, strength, suffering and action.The world Tony needs to be natural can never be his, yet the world like it is, is pretty much so, only in another sense, made for him, not to be owned by him. It is the world to be owned by the peaceful, in which the devil rules. Ends don't meet.A hymn to Schopenhauer and in Tony's case Schopenhauer's eternal justice even becomes credible, he's exactly the kind of melodramatic figure that is needed for that. But in this fate and its lesson there really is rest for the tormented, pain loses its teeth if it all wasn't meant to make sense anyway.A huge film, no doubt, one of the best.",Scarface

I just don't see the value of this movie. True, it shows that for a while, being in this business has its high points, yet in the end your evil deeds will catch up with you.

361,avisheksahu-81273,Miami Sending You Home!,9,20 June 2021,"Ascensions are brutal, especially when marked with overcoming heavy odds and towering obstacles for what goes up has to come down is the law manifested time and again in a million conquers. The best that has been done to allay such disincentives to the desire to conquer has been addressed to quite an extent in The Godfather 2 where the seemingly good judgement of the conqueror stretches his conquest to many years of depression instead of a precipitous crash into oblivion as is glorified in this one. Differences apart, this movie scores over the other in driving home that dreaded message not by drawing on the underprivileged upbringing of the chief protagonist but by glorifying the high that comes not from trumping your enemies but by trumping the ones you trumped your enemies with for what seems like plain old sibling rivalry in the higher echelons of the mafia translates into pretty much the same thing with more unacceptable connotations in the story of the rise of blood brothers finding family in the other's shortcomings. The lesson then is not in the inevitability of an informally contrived law, psychobabble at best, but in the primal motivation to see a conquest as an individual achievement, to be sustained and honed by the barely legible hierarchies forged in battle. Fluid hierarchies aren't demands of Organizational Behavior; instead, they are just frameworks that keep the economics of a setup from being dissected into pieces by rivals, ever aware of its genesis, and its foundations, to have accommodated it in their game of thrones.",Scarface

He not only makes Paul Muni look great in the original, he even makes George Raft look good.The whole film looks like de Palma, Pacino, and everyone else involved in it, stuck too much of that white powder that figures so prominently up their noses.

363,joaocruzferreira,The Most Underrated Movie in Hollywood History,8,13 June 2007,"Scarface presents us Al Pacino at his best, in a role that resembles Macbeth - due to the overwhelming hunger for power and its consequences. Pacino is extraordinary as Tony, playing the ruthless title character to astonishing perfection. With an actor as accomplished as Pacino, it's nearly impossible to pinpoint his finest career performance, but it's reasonably safe to assume that his work in ""Scarface"" ranks near the top of his impressive list. The ending is simply amazing, with Montana getting repeatedly shot and still standing.Two decades after its original release, this Al Pacino masterpiece continues to thrive because of its exceptional performances, gripping storyline and compelling script. There are no fancy special effects to grab your attention, no high-tech gadgets either. Just brilliant directing, writing and acting.

The premise is very interesting, at least enough for me to watch all three hours of the film. This movie has over-the-top violence.I know a lot of people like Scarface, but I wasn't blown away by it. It's a pretty standard rise-to-power story that's excessive in everything it does. From the acting to the violence to the language to the drug use to the sound to the runtime, everything's over-the-top. I get that excess is the point, but it's just unpleasant to watch at times. Still, there are some impressive moments, and I think this film sticks the landing in the third act.",Scarface
366,mikavir,Classic,9,23 April 2021,Brian De Palma's Scarface is a remake but unusually better than original Scarface by Howard Hawks (1932). This version tells about drug criminal Tony Montana who is a Cuban refugee.Montana is initially just a subordinate of a drug lord but his status rises during the movie. The number of his enemies rises as much as his status rises. As the subplot the movie depicts Montana's quarrelsome family matters. The final scene is dramatic and memorable.The main actor Al pacino is the dominate actor of the movie. Pfeiffer as Tony's wife Elvira is very cool and elegant. Mastrantonio as Tony's sister is excellent. Scarface is very impressive crime movie. The greedy world of Miami's drug lords is just appropriate place for this story. Miami's criminal life is credible enough. This movie is one of the best crime movies ever though some better ones has been done. Scarface is for the friends of crime and thriller movies. 9/10.,Scarface

It is treat to watch Al Pacino as a Cuban drug lord. This movie depicts the refugee's of Cuba and what happened in the 80's in true sense. The culture ,like the chicks ,cars,drugs and money ,a business run by one man ,Tony Montana. On the other hand it portrays different relationships of Tony with his sister,Gina,Elvira,his love interest and his sidekick and best friend,Manny Riberra played by Steven Bauer. I really liked every performance especially AL pacino's. It was a great inspiration to GTA :Vice City (On of my favorite video games) as i played the game first ,now i know from where those all things came from. The twist ending in the mansion where everyone dies including Tony makes it more great and reminds us all the where the path of crime ends. Everyone did a good Job. Michelle Pfeiffer,she looks so pretty and the most likable dialogue of her in movie is ""Would you stop saying f***"" She portrays a drug addict perfectly Mary Elizabeth Mastranton,looks so cute in the beginning and turns to tramp as his brother Tony thinks,She is very good.

368,Pinback-4,Gangster classic that was years ahead of its time.,9,27 January 2000,"SCARFACE is one of the all-time great gangster films.  This is a movie that, like BLADE RUNNER, was considered garbage when first released, but now considered a cult classic.  It was easy to see why the critics hated it so much back then.  It contains excessively brutal violence, foul language, and a lot of drug use.  Everything in this movie is excessive, in fact, including the running time.  This is because Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone don't want to glorify drug kingpins like Tony Montana, played by Al Pacino in an all-out performance that should've gotten the Oscar.  There is good acting by others, especially Steven Bauer as Montana's partner.  He has the funniest scene in the movie in which he demonstrates his unique method of picking up girls.  A small but key performance is given by Paul Shenar as Sosa, Tony's Bolivian connection.  All of the male actors, in fact give believable performances:  Robert Loggia, Harris Yulin, F. Murray Abraham. It is the females who bring down the film a bit.  Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first significant role, seems too wooden.  Her most important last scene in the restaurant lacks conviction.  A little better is Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's little sister, but her character draws unintentional laughter because of her mushroom cloud hairstyle.  Their screen time is limited, though, and don't ruin the film.",Scarface

It's still one of the most violent movies i've ever seen, but compared to Kill Bill it's rather tame.An update of the 1932 film, Scarface (1983) follows gangster Tony Montana and his close friend Manny Ray from their trip on the Cuban Boat Lift for refugees to their arrival in Miami. After killing a powerful Cuban figure, Montana and company gain the ability to leave their refugee camps and roam around the U.S. After unsuccessfully trying to make it legitamately in the country, Montana and Ray resort to selling cocaine to dealers around the world. Tony's rise is quick, but as he becomes more powerful, his enemies and his own paranoia begin to plague his empire.Al Pacino sets the screen on fire as Tony Montana. This other than The Godfather Part II, is his best movie yet. I suggest all of you check this movie out! It's quite an impressive piece of cinema history.****/****",Scarface
374,stubbers,Violent but moralistic gangster tale,9,11 February 2005,"INCLUDES SPOILERS! This is one of the very best gangster films I've ever seen. Almost all of that brilliance derives from Al Pacino's performance...on every level Tony Montana should be a truly contemptible piece of work: a treacherous, foul-mouthed, coke-addicted murdering gangster. But you empathise with him, if not sympathise. You understand his mentality, you can see the twisted logic to his actions. He plays the big guys at their own game and does it smarter, more efficiently, and even more honestly than they do. He wastes anyone who stands between him and what he wants: he falls for his boss's girlfriend, so he ends up betraying his boss, shooting him and marrying his girlfriend. Nice behaviour! And yet the viewer comes away feeling the weaselly, irritating boss deserved everything he got.Ultimately Tony's downfall becomes imminent because he has nothing left to prove, nothing left to offer, and so an entropy of paranoia, laziness and arrogance sets in. However the denouement is actually triggered by a momentary fit of anger, when he discovers his sister at the apartment of his sidekick Manny and he instantly shoots him. Like ""Casino"", all the power and money in the world cannot smooth over complex interpersonal relationships between gangsters, their girlfriends and their friends and family. ""Scarface"" combines the brutal, semi-dehumanised power of the Miami gangs with the more down-to-earth issues of having your mother disapprove of you, idolising your younger sister (to a point of suffocation where you refuse to accept that she has grown up and has her own life) and ultimately, the absolute futility of cocaine use.As for the ""cheesy"" music, I'm a big fan of Giorgio Moroder and although I can see how the brash synthpop is not to everyone's tastes, it does work perfectly in the context of providing a loud, tasteless, gaudy sheen of 80s glamour to the lifestyle depicted in the movie. That is exactly the kind of music non-artistic, money-orientated people would have danced to in image-conscious, coke-sniffing 80s discos. In fact, that's still the kind of music those sort of people would listen to today, although with more updated synth sounds! What's noticeable as well is how as the movie progresses the music becomes steadily slower, less bubbly and more morose sounding. By the end, the synths themselves seem to be having trouble breathing, with long, ponderous minor chords replacing the sub-Madonna bounce of the early scenes. Pompous classical music would have glamorised the movie, lending it a somewhat bogus air of sophistication and culture. Shallow 80s synthpop is much more in keeping with shallow 80s gangsters! It's definitely a movie that turns you off cocaine (not that I was ever turned onto it). It should turn you off violence as well, because it clearly demonstrates that in the end there are no winners. Nobody walks away with their head held high (apart from the gangster at the very end who shoots Montana in the back...but even he seems to plod away dejectedly as he takes stock of the blood-red swimming pool and dozens of mutilated bodies lying around the remains of Montana's mansion.The uneasy combination of shallow, cheesy glamour and extreme violence is what makes this movie stands out for me. Without the violence it would have just been cheesy. Without the cheesiness it would have just been violent. But juxtapose the two elements and suddenly each becomes more stark, more unnerving, more psychological. Like horror films that feature children singing nursery rhymes. There are loads of scenes that have this strange juxtaposition: such as after the chainsaw incident when Montana shoots the coke dealer in the street, in front of dozens of people, and then jumps into a car with blaring pop music as if shooting people is the most casual, everyday thing in the world. Or in the Babylon club where a ropey old cabaret act is suddenly interrupted by gunfire and an attempt to take Montana's life.There's one person who in particular seemed to really take on board this combination of violence and cheesiness...Mr Quention Tarantino. The tone, style and aesthetics of Scarface formed a clear prototype for later movies such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.Who on earth would want to be a gangster?!

377,jeek,Al Pacino delivers pure movie dynamite!,7,18 March 2001,"I just read Leonard Maltin's review and I'm in shock.  He claims that this movie wallows in ""excess and unpleasantness for nearly three hours with no new insights"".  Let me tear apart his opinion, if you will: 
#1:  Hollywood films are supposed to be excessive.  Although I hold much disdain for the shallowness of Hollywood productions, this is one instance where they got it right.  What do you expect from coke dealers? The dope dealers life is one of excess.  Hollywood usually entertains the audience with car chases and shoot outs and I think that Oliver Stone and Brian DePalma handled it with a keen sense of detail.#2.  The life of a drug dealer is unpleasant to the common citizen.  Murder, corruption, and violence go hand-in-hand when it comes to cocaine smuggling. What the hell did Leonard Maltin expect?#3.  I can't stand it when people complain about movies being too long.  I love long movies, as long as the film makers keep it interesting.  Long movies usually deliver an epic movie experience that's well worth the price of admission or rental.#4.  ""Scarface"" does in fact offer new insight.  This film was made during the '80's when the rich got richer and  coke flooded the streets of the U.S. and the rest of the world.  While yuppies moved their way up the corporate ladder, bought the new car and penthouse, they also snorted mountains. Oliver Stone's script points out the excess of capitalism.  The best example is Pacino's speech in the restaurant:  ""is this what i work for?...eating, drinking, focking, sucking, snorting..."".  Scarface has it all:  the biggest house, the most expensive car, the best clothes, the finest woman, $$$, power, an arsenal of weapons, and all the coke you could inhale.  Tony Montana comes from a communist country where all these things are unattainable, but he accomplishes success across the pond and he's still unhappy. Yeah, maybe the theme 'crime doesn't pay' isn't that original,  but it does speak volumes about the greed and excess of the 1980's.Finally, Al Pacino's performance is stunning.  I can't think of any role he's played in that even comes close.  Tony Montana makes Michael Corleone look like an alter boy, and yet it's 100% believable.  I totally forgot it was Pacino in the role, I truly believed he was a Cuban refuge.This movie is fantastic.  It's one of the favorites of my generation x counterparts.",Scarface

The vulgar language and violent carnage is wonderful and somehow works in this never boring classic. Many other films of this type I find distasteful and offensive but for reasons I can't explain this one I never tire of seeing.

380,marlyly,Some of Al Pacino's Finest Acting - and That's Saying Something!,9,4 October 2008,"Scarface is one of those films that you just have to see. The story of Tony Montana, a Cuban who after being refused entry to the US, manages to get a green card through a slightly less legitimate route (killing a man), and once in the US will stop at nothing to work his way to the top of an empire built on blood and cocaine. It is a tale of greed, power, ambition, money with a slightly moral aspect - possessions don't buy you happiness.Al Pacino is incredible in this - the character of Tony Montana is unforgettable, and despite being such a brutal, cold-hearted killer Montana comes across as endearing to the viewers - you at once think he's cool, envy him his success, whilst pity him the fact that though he has everything he in fact has nothing at all. Michelle Pfeiffer also gives an unforgettable performance as Elvira Hancock, though Manny River could have been far better cast than Steven Bauer in my opinion, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio had so much potential with Gina that was left un-found.This type of film is not for everyone - plenty of murder, drugs and swearing, yet it is just one of those films that you have to watch at least once. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Al Pacino is incredible, and his portrayal of Tony Montana will probably remain one of my favourite pieces of acting ever.

DePalma said many times he made this film to show the futility of violence and complete emptiness that type of will lead you to.

Reminiscent of the older film is the blimp bearing the writings "" The World is yours"" As a Cuban-American I take issued with the way we Cuban'Americans are portrayed.To begin with the script was written by Oliver Stone, a man who has made a living putting down those of us who oppose communism. Having the likes of Stone write the script was the equivalent of of having a white supremacist write a script on black history. He (Stone) has made it clear in interviews his thoughts on anti-Castro Cuban-Americans.The film of a Cuban refugee who arrives by way of Mariel, and became disillusioned with mundane work , and goes on to become a drug kingpin, was entertaining but was it. As a former Police Officer I know that much of what happened was totally fake. that isn't the way the drug trade , and police agencies operate. Most of it was pure artistic license.A ""battalion"" of hundreds of Bolivian hit men, just doesn't fly into Coral Gables Fl and proceeds to take an estate and it's occupants. Pure artistic license. The local police , and ""military authorities"" may object.Entertaining but pure fiction.",Scarface
385,jrkdany,Great,8,11 June 2021,I for some reason postponed watching this movie. I didn't want to watch another gangster movie by Al Pacino. But since I had nothing else to watch I watched this movie and fell in love with it. The screen play by Oliver Stone doesn't lag anywhere. I never felt the movie was almost 3 hours long. And Al Pacino was mesmerizing. He portrays his transformation from a nobody to leader very well while retaining the passion throughout. Michelle Pfeiffer was looking great and the dinner scene was awesome. Every scene has been crafter very well. The sets were awesome. The ending was perfect.,Scarface
386,TonyHurtado,Al Pacino's Best!,10,23 May 2010,"I finally had enough time to sit down to watch the icon Al Pacino at his best in the movie Scarface. The best mob movie I ever seen. I always thought it was one of those overrated films that only stupid Italians liked but this turned out to be one of the greatest films I have watched next to GoodFellas. Probably Al Pacino's best performance next to the Godfather. The story of this film was very well constructed, the director Brian DePalma got great shots for certain scenes throughout the film. It's basically one man who was at the bottom at the food chain of the mob rose to the top due to one job he did perfectly, then he let the power go to his head and became very successful in the mob. Allot of people and critics like those type of Movie Stories.",Scarface
387,tuhin94,Pacino is really deserving of having those millions of posters in people's homes,9,23 February 2014,"It is unavoidable to bring up Michael Corleone when Scarface is the subject. Heck, I did it before I even watched the movie. The reason, obviously, because Montana and Corleone are both big shots of the underground. But while Montana chose his life, Corleone did not. Anyway, enough about the comparison because it is not as relevant as it seems. I will say it over and over again that Scarface is probably Al Pacino's best performance because he flawlessly portrayed a character who was like a polar opposite. From the accent to the mannerisms to the way of life, I think it would be very difficult to find another man unlike Pacino. But man, that accent was terrific. Cubans might disagree because they would have a keener ear, but it seemed pretty close to me. The long continuous scenes typical of this era are executed brilliantly. I always mention how I miss those these days. It kept focus on the scene better than otherwise short sequences with multiple angle switches. And the action scenes are quite fun to watch. Of course, this being the 1980s there are a few scenes that contain the dreaded overacting. And there are so many slangs, it is necessary to keep Urban Dictionary open. This adds to the genuineness, so it is a plus. I was niggled by the preposterous amounts of bullets used. I get that it is a dramatic movie, but when everything else is so terrific, why go to great lengths to make your bad guys look like utter klutzes? And the scene in the Babylon with the assassination attempt, there was no need for the build up to the shoot-out; it was just annoying. A great performance by the whole cast and a great production from the whole crew that is indeed worthy of all the praise and frenzy created by it. Watched 02/22/2014, written 02/23/2014.",Scarface
388,mcgriswald,Realistic portrayal of a cocaine kingpin,8,11 February 2007,"As the entire drug culture segued from the psychedelic era of the 60s and early 70s to the Studio 54/Disco era of the late 70s, early 80s, an interesting phenomenon, the ultra-violent drug lord appeared. Americans who may have shunned LSD and marijuana became enrapt by the drug of glamor, cocaine. With the increased demand came huge profits to be made by those ruthless and violent enough to dominate the underground world of narcotics trafficking.Enter Tony Montana, a man who was in the right place at the right time, and could parlay his own extreme amoral ambitions into untold wealth. The character played by Al Pacino in the movie Scarface is often written off as over the top, too violent and too extreme.Far from it.Men like Tony Montana were responsible for a murder rate that grew 500% in cities like Los Angeles and Miami. Places where authorities would estimate with total seriousness that two people would be killed by falling bullets fired from these gangster's automatic weapons in celebration of New Years.Men like Tony Montana were responsible for the federal governments discontinuing the printing of higher denomination bills, since they were usually used by drug dealers. Men who not only used the famed automatic bill counter, but got to a point where they were weighing money instead of counting it.That Tony was Cuban only fit the Mariel Boatlift plot device at the beginning; he could have been Colombian, Mexican or Jamaican, among others. That Tony suffered hubris and met his demise reflected events that were far too common. That he died in a hail of automatic weapons and that military style arms were used was also not an atypical death for one of these guys. Rocket launchers, hand grenades, armor piercing rounds--all occasionally used against adversaries.Tony's descent into madness and paranoia was also typical of cocaine addiction--while most people don't suffer as flashy an end as Tony, thousands and thousands of people ended up as addled as he.So for those of you out there who think this all just a big overwrought exercise in excess, think again.",Scarface

391,AudemarsPiguet,Push it to the limit!Welcome to the limit!,10,25 June 2005,"The first impression ever made about this film and its main character,even before I fully watched or understood it,was the immense lust for life,dignity and harsh masculine beauty(not necessarily in the outer sense of the word)Pacino invests in this character.This impression lingered with me obsessively long after the film was over and was boosted by further viewings. While it is redundant to repeat the story of Tony Montana,the main character of this film,it is very important to stress upon the fact that,without wanting to elude his vulnerability,he still is the product of his age and society. His story actually stats like a history lesson,beginning when the Cold War slowly drew to a close and Cuban refugees could enter the U.S.,Tony being one. For the petty criminal the new country truly is the promised land,but this was the general mood at the turn from the 1970's to the 1980's. The story starts during Jimmy Carter's reign,but much of Montana's rise as successful gangland baron takes place during the administration of a Ronald Reagan. Apparently unimportant trivia but it explains much of the context in which Montana rose to power-the Reagan era marks the shift from a Baptist,Christian,unspectacular president like Carter to a more ambitious one:Reagan the actor,the showman,the marketer(of his own public image).At the same time,with Reagan's direct support it marks a historical change from two decades of relentless social turmoil,crisis,shaken credibility to an age when the U.S. is regaining is status as world power,when a new hedonistic and egocentric generation of ""golden boys"",tired of the elder generation's nihilism and hippie rebellion,will turn a seemingly endless and incurable economic recession in an age of unprecedented prosperity when consumerism and cashing in legendarily climaxed. History records this period as ""reaganism"" and its motto was:""Greed...is good"",Montana illustrating this mentality as good as the broker acted by Michael Douglas in the film ""Wall Street"" which made these words famous. From rags to riches in record time at all cost-this is the way even crime became an economical wonder in the gilded 1980's. In a few years former penniless immigrant becomes head of a multimillion empire where money keeps on rolling in. The soundtrack,considered by many worse than that of a dated porn,is not only awesome,making the film worth watching almost only to hear it,its cult classic ""Push it to the limit"" says it all-this outstandingly,divinely decadent and lush track reminding of the not least famous theme from ""Neverending story""(both soundtracks being composed by the timelessly compelling genius Giorgio Moroder)represent a state,a mood,which makes the two so different films resemble:they are both lavish 80's modern legends,both dealing with initiating journeys,only that ""Scarface"" is a more violent,yet equally fascinating never-ending story about the almost mythical quest incited by unlimited ambition. Even this film's flaws-though unimportant-are the typical product of the eighties.The visuals are extremely unprofessional,during the entire film the image looking rather shabby due to extremely bleak,poor use of light and color,the viewer easily mistaking this film with a typical B-movie of that age,these commercial,cheap films seen on the rudimentary videotapes of that age including martial arts and boring,unpretentious amounts of pointless violence and nudity. Ironically this flaw mentioned above would taint every other cinematic masterpiece,however considering the subject,the B-movie quality is an advantage as it may be intentional to add to this film more ""hood"" credibility. Tony Montana is far more than a simple newly rich criminal,he is a complex ,at a certain degree,even barbarically,savagely heroic character.His famous speech in titled ""Make way for the bad guy"" is an interesting and uncomfortably ironic view at 1980's consumerism. While acknowledging that he is a typical product of his age he still finds the power to sneer at the lucrative,but superficial social establishment of this period. Pacino almost anticipates the not less controversial speech of his later character Frank Slade from ""Scent of a woman"",in both of the cases two harsh,macho-like yet innerly uncompromising characters revealing profound and radical truths in a uncensored,sharp language. One ends up considering the bad guy less immoral than the more respectable members of society-at least in Montana's case you know that he is a killer,a drug-dealer while other far more influential politicians and tycoons only knew to hide their speculations better,had respectable images and no criminal record. Especially in the 1980's U.S.,it was unimportant how to get rich,in Reaganism only the outcome mattered and while people like Montana were the scapegoats and/or the guys who did the dirty work so that more ""respectable"" people don't get soiled(in both cases Montana was useful to society and its ""pilars""),while more immoral people performed the same shady deals at a larger scale,comfortably hidden by their conventional WASP image and their superficial appearance of righteousness. Gifted with the ambition of a Shakespearean character,in Montana's case,in a twist differing from Shakespeare,it is not his ambition leading to his irremediable downfall.It may be partly explained that during the 1980's one couldn't be too ambitious and,unlike in the Shakespearean tragedy,even pathological,Machiavellian,unrestrained ambition hadn't a bad press. The only thing not allowed in this calculating,overly greedy age was to show your human side and while in the world of crime feelings were always an impediment,being so 1980's America(even if not as criminal)was the worst move possible.Like in the closing scene from Macbeth,Montana will be confronted with final consequence of his deeds with Shakespearean depth and intensity... Montana's rise and fall also remind of another typical gangster embodying the American Dream-Gatsby,even the pool where Montana is finally crashing into seem like a reference to the not less famous swimming pool scene. Both Montana and Gatsby are of humble origins,both craving for money and power,and after owning ""the world"" for a while,both have to discover the emptiness of the American Dream,both end up floating in a pool. Everything mentioned above and many more subtleties of this masterpiece almost turn it into a period drama about the recent past, a lavish portion of 1980's memorabilia combined with unexpected art film accomplishment and Pacino(along with Scent.. and Godfather)at his best.",Scarface

As with every DePalma film I've seen, you're left trying to piece together why something's just happened and make some sense of the story. Forget it, it doesn't matter who writes the screenplay, DePalma will mangle it.All that matters in this as in all his films, is the sensationalism, visual and audible. It's always loud, garish and colourful, but I wish it meant a bit more and was easier to follow. You just get vivid, desperate to be iconic scene followed by trite small talk then next big scene, so it's bang bang, drivel, bang bang, drivel, bang bang with no meaningful narrative linking them.

Being honest, I had a hard time listening to Pacino opening up his mouth and grimacing, trying to act bad and angry. Many worship this movie as if it's a lesser Godfather but it's hard to put it aside with every scene that Pacino sounds like an Italian who swallowed a Spaniard with speech impediment. You just have too laugh.Even the famous lines from this movie are meant to be laughable, over the top moments, the same you'd have from your average B movie, which this is with just MUCH better production value, actors and sets.

(Or care if they do.) I just need to get it off my mind.The film is artless and has no redeeming virtues save as a very amateurish attempt to display what Ollie Stone saw as a bitter young man's descent into compensatory narcissistic and sociopathic hell. (One could say precisely the same thing about the 1932 Warner Brothers version, as well, save for its revelation of ""Ma's"" awful enabling.)De Palma's direction wouldn't have gotten him a renewal after a first season, free TV crime drama. Lighting serves mood. But the lighting here serves nothing. Music serves mood (as Scorcese and Coppola =well= understood). But the music here serves nothing.The characters are cardboard cutouts of what Ollie imagined Miami thugs to be, with no more depth to them than Cash's & Epps's in Warren Beatty's later cinematic comic book, ""Dick Tracy.""

In a small comparison if you look at Tony Montana when he is at his highest point he has more charisma and is more flamboyant and when he needs to be he can be seriously more violent (hence the famous quote) whereas with his performance as Michael Corleone he is more subtle, calculating and crafty gangster.As the film goes on you can see Tony Montana succumb more and more to greed and this is where the violence of the character kicks in with the most memorable quote ""say hello to my little friend"" .

Sticking with the flaws first: De Palma's handling (or non-handling) of female roles is apparent, with Elvira and Gina being little more than scantily-clad cardboard cut-outs. The soundtrack is also typical De Palma - tacky. The overall plot is very thin (you can make a lot of money out of drug-dealing, and you'll probably end up dead). However, De Palma's instinct for excess works well in this film, with the tracking-shots and the rich colours being ideally suited to the decadence resulting from having so much cash that you need machines to count it and helpers to carry it in to the bank. It's really Al Pacino that carries the film, though (how often have we said that?). His accent is a bit dodgy but apart from that he does a magnificent job in a multi-faceted role: charismatic male-buddy, charming ladies-man, street-smart operator, vicious tough-guy with a heart. You imagine what a great life he could've led if only he'd picked a different career! The scene in the restaurant where he rants at the 'straight' people is really the closest we get to the message of the film - it's just a shame that he had to be stoned: imagine what a speech he could've made if his mind was clear!

404,bkam,Unspectacular but satisfying,8,24 December 2003,"Small spoilers (I describe a few scenes in sparse detail).Scarface, while it can claim no real originality (and indeed is based on an older movie which I have not seen), is an entertaining and well-done movie about the rise and fall of a crime boss.  Naturally, the plot has been done to death, but Al Pacino helps as the consistently good and occasionally excellent lead, and the acting all around is reasonably bearable and convincing.  The score, while a bit too 80s at times, fits well with Tony's rage, and generally adds to the suspense of the film.The main merit of this film is its unrelenting portrayal of the criminal life.  The camera somehow manages to maintain a sense of the headstrong stupidity which Pacino captures so well, accentuating the unpredictable and ruthless attitude of the protagonist.  In no way does the film attempt to soften or to justify Tony's extreme and for the most part imprudent actions. He is not a good guy who has to do a couple of violent things to stay on top.  From the beginning, he is a sadistic idiot, and as he says in the chillingly great restaurant scene, he is the bad guy.  He is stubborn to the end, and it is partly his inane impenitence that makes his character so memorable.  This is the way the film remains suspenseful, as well, because the audience never knows what this crazy guy is going to do next.  The ending, while I won't spoil it, fits perfectly with his character and the film refuses to withhold a single blow from its audience even here in its dying throes.  The reason this film is great is because Tony is not a hero, but a villain, and furthermore that it never condescends to give him any heroic traits.  The movie itself is as ruthless as Tony, and it is the masterful relationship between film and character in this film that combines to leave a lasting impact.  [8/10]",Scarface
405,jghbrown,A good man turned bad,9,12 November 2016,"Tony Montana was a man who wanted to get married and have children.He had some excellent qualities. He had incredible courage. How many people could watch their friend being carved up with a chainsaw and then spit defiance into the face of the man who did it? He was honest and forthright. He loved kids. He loved his sister. And his friend Manny.Somewhere along the line he came to the belief that in order to get married to the most suitable woman you would need to have lots of money. So get rich first. With all the trappings - the boats, the fancy cars and gaudy residences (and, of course, tigers) - which are likely to attract the right sort of woman. But how do you achieve that if you have no education or skills? Well, crime of course.So there was the man who wanted to get married and have kids and the man who wanted to get rich. And gradually these two individuals grew apart and began to destroy each other. As the movie progresses he turns into some kind of bloated monster, snorting his way like a pig through ever-growing piles of coke as he begins to realise that the vast sums of money he is making are not delivering the things he at heart wanted. Moreover, he is less and less happy and snaps at every little thing. The filming is deliberately over the top, from the comical and tastelessly gaudy furnishings of his home, to his boorish and drunken behaviour at an up-market restaurant. His wife (who is not a dumb blond) despises him. His close associates cringe in embarrassment (and fear) at his ridiculous antics.He knows all this and hates himself for it. But he can no longer escape. He has reached the pinnacle of his financial success and he must go on. Yet, from time to time we hear from the other Tony Montana. He keeps asking after Elvira after she leaves him. At the last moment he refuses to assassinate a hostile journalist because there are kids in the car.Under all the strain (and cocaine) he becomes more and more confused. He is out of his depth. Drowning. He sees himself shoot his best friend and destroy his beloved sister. With another mountain of coke up his nostrils and a suicidal bravado he takes on several dozen people who have been sent to kill him. Realizing the emptiness of what he has become he is out to destroy himself, and he succeeds in this in the end with a melodramatic belly-flop into his own swimming pool. This last is so ludicrous that it's amusing, but that's the person he has become - a man consumed by power, drugs and greed, leaving the other Tony Montana somewhere else along the way.I don't like to see violence in films when it's there to titillate the audience. This is a violent movie because it depicts violent criminals. It's also a movie about a good and talented man who could have been happy with so little but fell into the wrong company.

406,Johnny0581,A timeless tale of an underdog who reached the top,10,6 November 2006,"""Scarface"" is the story of a Cuban immigrant who arrives in the US through a boat sent by Fidel Castro himself to purposely send all of his criminals to American soil and crap on Uncle Sam. His name is Tony Montana (Al Pacino) Upon Tony's arrival in America, he is already spotted as a potential threat and is interrogated by customs agents who find out a little bit of his history and decide to send him to a special camp where all Cuban undesirables are sent. Some time later, opportunity knocks in the form of murdering a Cuban general, sent to prison by Fidel himself, who tortured and killed govt. officials back in Cuba and now one of those official's brother, who is a powerful man in Miami, wants him dead. Tony, his best friend Manolo (Steven Bauer), and a few other friends carry out this task and earn themselves a Green Card. But this is only the beginning....This powerful man, turns out to be Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) a wealthy Miami drug lord whom Tony ends up working for. Frank Lopez's right hand man is Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) a guy who does not like Tony Montana's determination and attitude and calls him derogatory names like ""peasant"" and ""dish washer"" but Tony is not exactly crazy about him either. We also meet Tony's sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Manstrantonio) a beautiful 19-year old for whom Manolo falls for, but Tony does not want Manolo anywhere near his sister, because is the only pure untouched thing in his life and does not want her to be corrupted by his world, but eventually this does happen. Later on, Tony falls head over heels for Frank's sexy, young wife Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer) who despite her beauty and wealth, is always miserable and does nothing but snort coke all day and never cracks a single smile. Tony starts making the moves on Elvira, until later on in the movie, snatches her away from Frank, but not before removing Frank from the map, but that comes later. During one of Tony's business trips we meet yet another character, The ruthless and even more powerful drug kingpin, Alejandro Sosa (Paul Shenar) a Bolivian landowner who has a drug empire that stretches all across South America. Tony does his best, at first to impress this new acquaintance, and when Sosa questions him about his loyalty, Tony is quick to assure Sosa that he is also someone not to be messed with and is a man of his word. When Tony reaches the top and is now more powerful than his boss, Frank, ever was. Manolo, Tony's right hand man begins to take care of Tony's finances, but, in Tony's words, Manolo cares more about women than business and therefore, does not trust him completely when it comes to money.During the almost three hours of the movie we get to see Tony's rise and then, after a hot-tempered decision, his imminent fall. Scarface is a story of not only an underdog who works his way up until he reaches the ""American dream"", but of the consequences of living in the fast lane. Like one of the songs from the movie soundtrack talks about ""Push it to the Limit"" which, thanks to this movie, is now a classic.Yes, this movie nowadays is idolized by pop culture and by rappers and gangsters all over the world. But the question is why a movie who did not do too well at the box office at the time of its release is more popular now than it was two decades ago?. Because the story and the message behind it is timeless. Perhaps because back in the early 80's people were not ready for an in-your-face, tell-it-like-it-is movie about something that is very real nowadays, drug trafficking, and for the standards of the time, the movie was very graphic. That perhaps, drove some moviegoers away and is maybe the reason why it was so panned by critics back then. But now, times are different and perhaps this movie speaks to the generation of today, who are more aware that these things are happening out there, or perhaps, because it sends out the same message their favorite hip-hop artists often talk about, which is making it to the top and earning respect through having balls and determination like Tony had. Yes, some people see it as a movie that glorifies crime and drugs and easy money. But the movie really has a deeper message. No one stays on top of the world forever. The world was his, yes, but not for long. In a few words..one of the best crime-drama movies of all time.",Scarface
407,m1xer,Al Pacinos Acting Shines more then the Film does.,9,11 March 2013,"The movie is about a 7 out of 10.Al Pacino the Cuban man with a hot head, headed to the top and will stop at nothing to get there is inspiring, cool, and puts the film at 9.Maybe his best performance ever. Even right on par with Michael Corleone in the Godfather and as the Good Cop in Heat. Serpico, A scent of a woman and of course Dog Day Afternoon are some of Als other great performances but his role as Tony Montana is an inspiration to so many excuse me for saying thugs. Thugs I know in town, thugs in the media, thugs in the main-stream like rappers.They all look up to Tony, a fearless man that says all he has in this life are his balls and his word, and he do not break them for anybody.One of the greatest lines in the film is THE WORLD IS YOURS.A neat little message, my favourite scene in the film is right before Tony takes Michelle Pfieffer and about to start his life as the boss half-way through the movie he looks at that blimp flight from American Airlines and the words..THE WORLD IS YOUR flash across the blimp and he takes a drag on his smoke all wounded thinking, I finally made it.This is my time.It also shows what happens when greed, power and coke get to your head. He double-crosses the guys he promises not too...When it is all said and done this 7 out of 10 movie, is pushed to a 9 for Als Performance as the Cuban Tony Montana.A great film and one of the most historic movie characters in the history of Cinema.Pacino shines...the World is Yours!",Scarface

What kind of world are you in, stating that its the worst movie ever made(common, then again your ignorance precedes you). This has to be the best of its genre of crimes, gangsters and violence. Ever since a lot of people kept rambling about this even 20 years after it's released, I've been dying to see what the fuss is about. comedians, rappers, actors always referring or quoting SCARFACE. After watching it i could understand why this movies so influential and so popular. Pacino displayed a distinct kind of acting that really made a mark on me. He was and became Tony Montana. No one else could have filled this arrogant, angry, ambitious, fearless and fierce persona other than Pacino. The portrayal of the character is so believable, intense and raw. As a viewer and admirer, you will cheer and follow his every move to become a vicious gangster and drug-lord. This is Pacino at his best and a role of a lifetime. Truly an amazing take into the character of Montana, he really gave it an icon for all those who love this genre. Much respect for Pacino in this masterpiece.The violence, rawness, intensity, an insight to the mind of an ambitious criminal. The direction, action, drama, depiction of Scarface is unmatched. A story, a film that you have to see once in a lifetime. The rise and fall of Tony Monatana, a wonderful masterpiece. 10/10 - Don't listen to critics, enjoy this to its full potential.",Scarface

Even though she knew the level of violence in this movie, she still took me because we were living in Miami at the time during the cocaine cowboys era. I was completely shocked by the violence, the profanity, and the drug use in the film. It's a terrific film that doubles as a morality tale. Al Pacino's depiction as Tony Montana is terrific. At times you almost forget he's really Italian. He is great at showing us how the game is played in the drug business. What you should do, what to avoid and, most of all, never want more than what you need.In short, this is a terrific gangster film.9 out of 10",Scarface

Murray Abraham.Spoilers herein.Tony Montana (Pacino) is a Cuban Refugee who arrives in America in 1980. As he lives in Miami, he notices that money, greed and women are all around him, and he makes a decision to rise above all others in the city.""Scarface"" is quite simply one hell of a movie, especially such an epic example of its genre. About every time I watch it, by the end, it leaves a huge impact on me. It is controversial among both movie fans and critics. The main reasons are because the film contains much excessive violence and has become a sort of inspiration for ""gangstas"". I think both are wrong, because the miss the message that it tries to give out. If these people didn't just skip to the final 10 (is it even that long?) minute shootout, then they would realize what the film really says.Tony Montana is a character in which you feel for at first and then, when it comes to the actions he makes, you begin to dislike his character. I found this several times in Scorsese's 'Raging Bull', where the main character is so despicable where you just have to feel sorry for the guy. Pacino well acts his character, but at times he plays him so villainously (and this may be the film's only flaw) that it gets a bit too over-the-top and his character becomes overblown.Brian De Palma (The Untouchables, Casualties of War) is a good director, but sometimes his angles confuse me. This is probably his best-directed movie though, along with ""Carlito's Way"". ""The Untouchables"" was by far the most enjoyable of them all, but here he creates tension inside the characters, mainly Tony, to where the suspense rises within them. It's a pretty smart move. The acting in the film is good. Stated above, Pacino is good in his role, and Bauer and Mastrantino give good supporting performances. Oliver Stone (JFK, Platoon) wrote the screenplay, and is a great start for his early work.Overall, if you are a fan of crime/drama or action films, this one is definitely for you. ""Scarface"" comes off the screen so powerfully stylish that you can't stop watching. But while you are viewing the film, please don't judge it for the action or violence, there is more to the film. It is actually an intense character study of a guy who tries to make it to the top, and once he realizes he's lost everything that it's impossible. I wish people would just learn from that. 4.5 stars out of 5.",Scarface
412,craigdoolan,"A good ride, but predictable",7,28 October 2019,"Somehow I managed to miss this movie as part of my film education, and had never seen it until 2019, though was certainly well aware of it. Perhaps this is part of the reason for being a bit underwhelmed, as it does date a bit, and has been superceded by far better fare such as Goodfellas.The movie looks great, has been directed with real style by Brian DePalma. The performances are all good, though not outstanding. Pacino is incredibly intense and really inhabits Tony, however there's not much subtlety there. Michelle Pfeiffer is also a bit one-note, though she isn't given a lot (compare with Sharon Stone's knock-out performance in Casino).The music, by Giorgio Moroder, is often annoying and dates the movie badly, as well as detracting from the drama at times. It was a good ride, but the movie went pretty much exactly where you knew it was going to go, right from the start. It signposted all key plot developments well ahead of time. A good afternoon's entertainment, but not a classic.",Scarface
413,chain67,Excessively Brilliant,10,12 May 2001,"Brian De Palma's remake of the 1932 classic ""Scarface"" nearly drowns in excess at times, but flourishes from it at other times. None of this is surprising considering Oliver Stone wrote the script. But this movie has to also be considered one of the bravest films of all time.   I won't say much about the plot which is pretty standard when it comes to gangster movies. It's about cuban refugee Tony Montana's(Al Pacino) rise and fall in the drug world. Eventhough other characters come and go, notably wife Elvira(Michelle Pfeiffer), best friend Manny(Steven Bauer), boss Frank Lopez(Robert Loggia) and sister Gina(Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, this is basically Montana's/Pacino's show.   In ""Scarface"", Al Pacino is at his over-the-top best as Montana. Whether he's burying his face into a pile of coke, shooting someone point blank in the head or refusing to kill two small children Montana always seems like a real, deep character. He's a ruthless business man and killer, but he also has an honour code, He'll become a drug addict as long as his sister doesn't ect. But what really makes this film work is how visibly Monatana evolves from a young hothead looking to get rich, to a burnt out, paranoid addict who has it all and wants even more.    I have heard a lot of arguments as to whether ""Scarface"" belongs in the company of ""The Godfather"" and other gangster classics. Well in my opinion it does. If not for being very original or deep, but for having enough balls to go further than any other gangster movie, plus for having one of the most brutal antihero/villains in history. Oh yah and don't forget it's 206 uses of the F-word third mot in history(After Pulp Fiction and what I consider the best gangster movie of all Goodfellas). Great study in excess and brutality. 9/10",Scarface
414,shafatqadri,Engrossing!!!!!!!!!!,9,21 May 2008,"""Scarface"" has a major cult following even now, 25 years after its release. In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster. He did it with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was 'Scarface,' starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.The story is about an immigrant Tony Montana (Al Pacino) from Cuba who has come to live the American dream. He is a hard core criminal and starts by being in detention, where he plots a murder. Next, he moves in the Florida where he starts working as a dish washer on a road side joint. The attraction of money and power drives him into taking chance with one drug deal that goes miserably wrong where his friend is killed, and he in turn kills other gang members. With his daring, he starts climbing the ladder of drug dealers, and reaches the pinnacle of power and wealth and gets more and crazier (due to drug addiction). Finally he is shot by his own beloved sister before being brutally killed by invading gang in his own palatial home.It's the one role which you can't imagine Al Pacino playing. This was his comeback film after a short break and what it comeback film it is. I think when Pacino leaves the ungodly earth and people talk about the role he will be remembered for, a lot will say Michael Corleone in The Godfather Trilogy but I will remember him as Tony Montana in Scarface.""Scarface"" is quite simply one hell of a movie, especially such an epic example of its genre. It is controversial among both movie fans and critics. The main reasons are because the film contains excessive violence and has become a sort of inspiration for ""gangsters"". I think both are wrong, because the miss the message that it tries to give out. If these people didn't just skip to the final 10 minute shootout, then they would realize what the film really says.Some of the scenes, especially the infamous chainsaw scene, are disturbing. Scarface is as savage as they say and much more.

It almost made feel its intrusive presence and, while I usually like to watch a movie in its entirety --- end titles included --- I really felt like cutting it at the last scene, because of the soundtrack. What have a I seen --- I thought --- a rock musical or what?I like considering the music as an integral part of a film, so I cannot consider this film worth more than 7 out of 10.Also, I hate watching dubbed movies, and although I saw Scarface in its original English, I couldn't help noting the absence of the original Spanish language!",Scarface

423,sapblatt,"Not a chick flick, no happy ending, and no sequels",8,3 December 2003,"I had the privilege of watching Scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release. It was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough. Scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring Al Pacino as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana. In this version, Tony comes to America during the Cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s, early 1980s. Tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in Tent City and after a brief stay at a Cuban restaurant; Tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction. Many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch I have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years. Robert Loggia as Tony's patron, Frank Lopez is wonderful. His character is flawed by being too trusting, and as Tony quickly figures out, soft. Lopez's right hand, Omar Suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors, F. Murray Abraham (Amadeus.) Suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for Frank; it is like he does not have a mind of his own. Tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with Suarez, but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top. The character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is Mel Bernstein, the audaciously corrupt Miami Narcotics detective played by Harris Yulin (Training Day.) Mel, without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry. He plays Tony off of Frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both Frank and Mel. It is priceless to hear Frank asking for Mel to intercede, as Tony is about to kill him only to hear Mel reply, `It's your tree Frank, you're sitting in it.' This is from the man who Frank had been paying for protection!Tony's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn. After offing Frank and taking his wife and business Tony's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough. As Tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs, greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married. This all sets up the ending in which Tony's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because Tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered. This all stems form a compassionate moment when Tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim's wife and children.
All in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture. DePalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around. The violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind, particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen, the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie. This is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish, or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels; DePalma let it all fly right here.",Scarface

Tony Montana is a larger than life character. And Al Pacino created him. As a character he is up their with Hannible Lector from Silence of the Lambs. But that movie whilst a 1 out of 10 too actually tried to be a good film.This movie only has ONE thing going for it and thats Pacino talking like a South American person trying to talk more South American than any other South American has ever talked. It was funny the first hour.Hell it was even funny the second hour.But you push it to three hours and your asking. Correction, your not asking anything. The movie needed to do more if its going to be a 3 hour film. The Godfather is a good example of how much story you can fit in to three hours. Scarface is a good example of how slowly you can pass 3 hours. Ether way both films were 1 out of 10. At least the Godfather bores me for good reasons.Stone penned this film based on his addiction to coke. At least that's what I heard. And the film shows. Its a sucky thing to base a 3 hour film on.

Thankfully it was edited, but basically that just meant that the ""F-word"" is blanked out, although there is definitely no imagination as to what is being said. Talk about violent, holy snap. I really don't see any reason why I would waste my time watching this movie again.So plenty of people say this is a very revolutionary film. How? There are plenty of good points, I just don't see how they are worth it. All the gangsters and the Hollywood stars love the movie too. I just think its all hype and no show. There are a unlimited amounts of poor effects and graphics. After two hours of this movie, I couldn't wait for it to end.Okay, enough of tearing the movie down. The gangster mentality from Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and the showy character is awesome. He definitely pulls it off like no other could. He rages constantly and just blows up if anything happens at all. It's nice to see that by the end of the movie, Tony loses and is destroyed by himself. His Cuban portrayal is pretty good, I'll have to admit, although his accent isn't all that good. All of the supporting characters do very well in reacting to Tony, especially in fear. Eventually, Tony basically kills everyone in the whole movie, so he gets what was coming to him.Oh yeah, the houses are really cool too.

Good artists borrow, great one's steal, or something like that.To be honest, I'm not a big fan of De Palma. Carrie was good, as were The Untouchables and this one, but I can't think of many other films of his that are really good. All copies of the Black Dahlia should be burned as a public service.But this one works and the funny thing is that it has improved with age.Someone else in this esteemed forum has suggested that this is original De Palma, not snitching from Hitchcock, or Spielberg or whomever. I disagree.If Stanley Kubrick had ever made a gangster flick, it would have looked much like this one, I think. The give away is not so much the way it is shot, but the set ups for each shot. The attention to detail, and the combination of colors, images and contrasts in each scene are totally Kubrick. So also are the moments of building suspense.The entire cast is good, but Pacino is amazing, allowed utterly free reign and running with it. Some of the lines he is required to utter are so over the top, I watch closely to see if he is struggling to keep a straight face, but he pulls it off.Forget all the stuff about this being a statement about the dark side of the American Dream blah blah blah (which begs the question as to what the bright side of the American Dream is, but I digress).

This story is just a bang, bang play, it's very dramatic to, a lot of yelling, the columbian cartel scene. The thrill goes up because it's like a ladder, you see him poor, having nothing at all, then one day he gets a job, he does bigger, and bigger jobs, not just the character is working his way up a ladder, but the thrill is because the bigger the job, the more dramatic, bloody it gets.

430,bayou_hannibal,There's a reason why it's the most influential crime drama of the past 30 years,10,1 June 2012,"In the 1980s, Scarface screenwriter Oliver Stone came up with two complete masterpieces that were years ahead of their time – Scarface and Wall Street. Both movies portrayed negative trends in America long before anyone was recognizing them or making commentaries about them. Both of them had heavy influence on their genre for decades to come, and both of them have held up over the years and are appropriately recognized as the masterpieces that they are.With Scarface, Oliver Stone and Brian De Palma gave us an entirely fresh look at organized crime and the war on drugs. Far from the romanticized portrayal of organized crime in the Godfather series, Scarface showed us a brutal, unforgiving, and shockingly violent world where the ambitious have a short life expectancy. Years before America started wavering in its support for the war on drugs, Scarface showed us how futile it was. It showed us the hypocrisy of allying ourselves with third world, drug-dealing dictators while trying to stop them from flooding our streets with their cash crops. The movie almost predicts the stories of men like Panama's Manuel Noriega, who was our ally until the Cold War ended, at which time he became public enemy #1 because of his association with the drug industry. It showed us how drug production, distribution, and selling was a machine-like business that stretched from the plantations of South America, through the offices of ""respectable"" bankers, and all the way to the halls of Washington D.C. Unlike many other movies since 1983 that are critical of our foreign policy or the war on drugs, Scarface is never ham-fisted. It shows you how our world is, and it lets you come to your own conclusions.Ultimately, Scarface plays out like a Greek tragedy, with our antihero on the rise until he reaches the climax, at which time he commits a critical mistake and his world begins to fall apart. The movie is paced somewhat slower than it probably would be today, and that is part of why it works so well. Tony's change from a hungry, street-smart thug on the rise to a coke-addicted millionaire on the decline is shown at a pace where it is believable. Specifically, Tony's gradually escalating use of drugs is brilliant. When we first see him use coke, he inhales a little pinch off of a toothpick. In a later scene, he's doing a whole line. By the end of the movie, he is burying his face into a pile of cocaine on his desk and coming apart at the seams. While we watch Tony's rise and fall, we are torn. We want him to succeed, but we also hate what he does, and that in the end, everything that happens to him is his own fault.Without Oliver Stone's brilliant script, this movie might have been irrelevant, and without Brian De Palma's brilliant direction, it might have been mediocre. Every actor and actress in this movie gives the best performance of their careers. Al Pacino as Tony Montana is brilliant. Nothing that Pacino has done has ever approached the personality that he gives Tony in Scarface. His facial expressions, his swagger, and even the way that he leads with his crotch when he walks – it's all part of making Tony into the greatest antihero in the history of film. Scarface is the only Al Pacino movie that I have seen that makes me forget that I am watching Al Pacino. Steven Bauer, who slipped into obscurity after this movie, gives a great performance as Tony's more laid back BFF. Robert Loggia plays an outwardly chummy drug kingpin who lacks the cutthroat instincts to survive, and Michelle Pfeiffer plays his incredibly cold, unfriendly, and self-centered, anorexic-looking trophy wife. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio also gives an excellent performance in a supporting role as Tony's sister.While Scarface is a great drama, it also has three of the greatest action scenes ever filmed. All of them feature an agonizing build-up of suspense as we watch the danger develop over a period of minutes, while the good guys indulge themselves in other activities. After what seems like an eternity, an explosion of gunfire and violence erupts in a short (by today's standards), well choreographed shootout. Despite being a drama, Scarface has about five minutes of action that easily rival the best scenes in any action movie ever made. Whenever I watch this movie, I usually watch these three scenes one extra time to get my fill.If you have never seen Scarface, then chances are, you have seen numerous pop culture references to it, as well as movies and video games that draw heavily from it. The Grand Theft Auto series, Blow, Traffic, New Jack City – all of them in some way trace their lineage to Scarface. Scarface is easily the most influential crime drama of the past 30 years, and there is a good reason why. The movie is a masterpiece, both in its storytelling, and in the meaning of the story.",Scarface

In film terms I believe it is a beautiful portrayal of 'if you play with matches, you will get burned'.I don't like myself for thinking it, but there was one decision that could have shown otherwise.... maybe in a sequel... :-DTwo other points, exceptional soundtrack, and quotable lines every other minute.Edit: I'm an ass, this film is 10/10 all day long.

Everything was very well worked although there were several errors, and therefore I can understand in some part the opinion of other users to not like this movie. I do not want to base my critic only on the performance of Al Pacino, but it is impossible not to highlight his impeccable interpretation by getting into the role of an immigrant Cuban with total naturalness, who along with his other colleagues also made an excellent performance.Ok, many comment that a person getting high as Caracortada did in the last scene and receiving bullets without collapsing is not credible, it is possible that at the moment a person does not feel anything, because in the end it would die from an overdose.",Scarface

I am so amazed at how there was practically no flaw with the movie. However, I was more amazed with how much this film affected me.

436,emeeme2003,The World Is Yours,8,25 March 2021,"At the dawn of that relentlessly loud, excessive decade we now know as the ""1980's"", Fidel Castro opened up the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, with the stated intention of letting some of his people rejoin their relatives in America; however, it soon became evident that he was also forcing the sailors to venture off with the dregs of his jails as well, as, of the 125,000 refugees that came off of those rusty, rickety, overflowing boats in Miami, an estimated 25,000 of them had criminal records.One of those refugees was Tony Montana, a petty scumbag whose larger-than-life dreams of breaking free from those desperate, unwashed masses in order to become a big shot has become immortalized in Brian De Palma's Scarface, a film that stands tall as the foremost cinematic artifact of that particular time and place, helping to commemorate Miami and the modern ""gold rush"" of cocaine trafficking it experienced in the 80's, and, in the process, becoming immortal as a blood-soaked crime opera every bit as over-the-top as the decade that birthed it, but one that's ultimately proven itself to be an enduring icon despite that (although it's probably more BECAUSE of that, now that I think about it).Of course, this Scarface retains the same basic rise-and-fall gangster narrative of Howard Hawks' original film, even though it exchanges the Prohibition/Capone-era Chicago setting of that film for Miami during its ""cocaine cowboys"" era, with the aforementioned Mariel boatlift serving as the inciting incident, which adds an undeniable political element to the film that original director Sidney Lumet initially wished to emphasize, an intent that is reflected in the film's constant use of news footage (both real and otherwise) to ground it in its particular social context, to the point that it's impossible to imagine it taking place any where, or when, else (which is ironic, considering that most of it was actually filmed in LA, due to backlash from the local Cuban community).However, despite those lingering creative fingerprints, this Scarface is ultimately all De Palma's (but more on that later), and, despite the strong supporting cast of characters, the film is also undeniably Tony Montana's, as it's also impossible to imagine the film without that walking, talking ball of hair trigger-tempered, barely-contained testosterone anchoring it, just like it's impossible to imagine the character being anywhere near as memorable without Al Pacino at his shoutiest portraying him, reasonable concerns about his spotty ""Cuban"" accent aside, although I would argue even that still adds to the camp/entertainment value of the film regardless (""Look at those pelicans fly, mang!"", anyone?).At any rate, I would argue that Tony's external arc of going from petty criminal to cocaine kingpin is one of the more compelling point-A-to-Z character journeys I've had the pleasure of witnessing, as his quest through the film's flashy underworld is relentlessly propulsive throughout, and his journey always feels like it's constantly moving forward to its next destination, never spinning its wheels, and, while he never really changes internally, the particular character flaws that he exhibits from the outset nonetheless become more and more exaggerated (and fatal) with accumulated time and power, due to his unrealistic ambitions and relentlessly self-destructive tendencies, which trap him a veritable blizzard-sized haze of coke towards the end, having lost, alienated, or just straight-up murdered every friend he had in the world, but, while inevitable, his downfall is still never predictable, as he blazes a bloody path across the fallen paradise that is Miami in this ludicrously melodramatic, larger-than-life-itself tragedy.Finally, Scarface ultimately succeeds just for the basic fact that it's an imminently rewatchable, outrageously entertaining film, whether you're talking about the dialogue that is as needlessy overwrought as it is relentlessly quotable (courtesy of the scripting of a young, trying-kick-the-habit Oliver Stone), which has earned the film a hallowed place in the Hip Hop sampling/quoting hall of fame (if it existed), or if you're considering De Palma's unmistakable cinematic sensibilities, which are reflected in the film's dark, unexpected moments of comic relief, or its shamelessly lurid, downright trashy (but somehow also completely appropriate) treatment of its subject matter, which repeatedly earned the film the dreaded X-rating for its sheer levels of gore, drug use, and then-record-breaking amount of F-bombs.Of course, you also can't forget about the film's overall shamelessly flashy, showy style, as Giorgio Moroder's synth-heavy pop provides a perfectly tacky soundtrack, Edward Richardson's art direction creates a tropical dreamland drenched in the incredibly vibrant neons and lush pastels that have become visual shorthands to the decade's overall aesthetic, and John A. Alonzo's cinematography lovingly tracks and roams all over the unspeakably opulent locations, with the perpetual sunsets often appearing as red as the blood that constantly bathes the characters themselves, as the city seems to exist in one long, eternal magic hour here. Like Elvira herself says at one point, nothing exceeds like excess, and Scarface proves that in spades, and then some (and then some even more, to boot).",Scarface

What this ends up being is a flimsy melodrama with nothing to say. Yes, Al Pacino delivers an incredible performance - but a great performance can't save a bad script. The only redeeming character in the piece is Tony's mother, but she barely has any screen time. The production values are high because it's a studio product. The relationships are never developed to any significant degree, and most of the lead characters simply fall in line with the life of crime and excess.

The point being that Scarface is a cultural touchstone, and a deliberate encapsulation of 1980s excess. It's all rolled up into a film to be fed to the audience at a drug-fueled pace.The movie has something to say about a life of excess, what's really important in life, and on the illusory ""American dream"" - with all the subtlety of a bullet to the head. Tony asks the viewer if they have the guts to really ""be what they want to be"". The film takes that recurring theme and pushes it to the limit.Al Pacino's performance is iconic, often mimicked, and so completely over-the-top to the point of it being unintentionally funny. It's endlessly rewatchable. There are so many quotable lines in the film, including a comical overuse of f-bombs. Giorgio Moroder's haunting synthwave soundtrack perfectly captures the 1980s, and smears itself all over the extremely visceral violent action scenes.Whether you love or hate it, it's a film that will refuse to leave you once you see it.",Scarface

The film is an uncompromising revelation of humanity's dark side as Pacino's character learns never to underestimate the other guy's greed. He neglects to learn the other important lesson -- never get caught in the vice you are pushing on others.Pacino's character wants the world and everything in it. That's what he gets.

It could have been a real fact, cause it sounds as a real story. Castro sent 125,000 refugees to Florida, and Tony Montana could have been one of them.But I hated one scene: the one with the chainsaw. It was so disgusting that I had a nausea the first time, but the rest is well done !!! My favorite part is the end of the movie, when Montana killed most of Sosa's henchmen sent to kill our hero. When he was killed by the shotgun bandit and fell in the pool, I thought myself that it was too bad for Tony Montana, cause he was very rich but very paranoid. Also, I was astonished when he was sniffing a mountain of coke and resisted to the hail of bullets.

Tony Montana is such an iconic character in cinematography, and his story of his rise to power and fall from glory shows what greed does to a man. While the characters are exaggerated and scenes are made unrealistic, it is still entertaining nonetheless. While watching the film and seeing Tony's slow decent into madness, I felt pitiful for him and while I wanted him to get better, I also wanted karma to catch up to him. That being said, when he meets his fate at the end of the movie I was a bit upset. I disliked Tony's actions and behavior but I still loved him as a character. Watching him push everyone that he loved and cared for away, trusting nobody but himself, it was all disheartening.

Some people reproach the film for being too long, but it is not uninteresting for a second and there is one clear advantage of having such a long movie- the audience begins to assosciate and sympathise with the characters ultimately making what happens to them far more interesting.Dark, thrilling, funny and packed with brilliant performances including the great Al Pacino (where was his Oscar for this?.

Everyone was a tedious, despicable psychopath, with no engaging personalities, giving me nothing to look forward to. I found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them.If there had been even one person of interest, and I don't mean good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with it.

457,GavAnderson,A disappointing attempt at a Gangster Flick,6,16 February 2005,"Scarface, a film by Bryan De Palma staring Al Pacino as a Cuban Immigrant who works his way into the Miami drug business.I'd heard a lot of good things about Scarface, and being a big fan of Gangster movies I was really looking forward to seeing it, but in the end I felt quite disappointed. You never really get the chance like or even understand Tony Montana. You know has issues with his sister but you never know why. He seems cold and distant, and only halfway in I'd lost all interest in him; weather he died or not I didn't care anymore. In the Godfather you feel as though you are a part of the family and even though they're criminals you sympathise with them, but Tony you don't care about and so no matter what happens to him it has no effect on you as a viewer. I tried to like him but as hard as I tried I still wanted him dead. The story is rushed, there's the rise and the fall but that's all, nothing in between. To put it simply this movie is depressing the main character is a psycho but not in a good way. Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver was a psycho but you knew why, you understood and liked him, this isn't the case with Montana.Scarface has got to be the most overrated Gangster flick ever; it's dull, simple and distant. De Palma's directing is nothing special and the story has no heart. Characters don't develop they change and a lot of their actions seem to be out of character. Films such as Pulp Fiction immerse you in a way that every character seems real but Stone clearly doesn't know his characters and neither does De Palma, they aren't believable and this to me is the real problem.I never understand why so many people rank Scarface so highly. It's not a masterpiece; it brings nothing new to the genre and can't even hope to compete with other Gangster films out there. I must admit that for the first half hour or so I quite enjoyed it and the chainsaw scene is classic but from there on it just started falling apart. If it's a Gangster film you're after go see Goodfellas, go see what a real Gangster film looks like.5/10- As good as Pacino's acting may be even he cant save Scarface.

It is evenly spread out, and that's what makes the movie perfect.

And ""Say hello to my little friend"" is now one of my favorite lines. This was a good movie, but there are some things said about this movie that I don't think are true1. Greatest gangster movie ever- Give me a break. This movie paled in comparison to ""godfather"" that it's not even funny. The end of godfather is probanly the most well done scene I've ever seen in a movie. I don't think this movie was too long however2. Most violent- Yes, it's violent enough that I wouldn't recommend showing a 10 yr old. However, 17 years after it was made, the violence is a little more than what you would see in your common rated R action flick. I am shocked to hear that this movie was originally an X but i guess things weren't just that violent at the time. The chainsaw scene is a little gross and pretty bloody although they don't show anything else besides the blood spilling out. There are a couple other murders that are a little disgusting3. Great acting- Al Pacino was very good in the role that you don't even recognize him. However, he is such a good actor that I wouldn't rate this among his better films and he rightfully did not get nominated for an academy award. I thought the other acting was mediocre at best. Michelle Pfifer was very unmemorable in her first major role as a super bitch and Robbert Loggia as an Italian, give me a break.Sometime, I would recommend you see this movie because although it is not as powerful in today's times. it still is a little powerful. Plus, there is still probably more cursing than anything i've seen maybe outside ""goodfellas"" and ""glengarry glen Ross"".

465,parachute-4,A Pacino Classic,7,25 November 2006,"An All-American gangster movie in the grand tradition. Al Pacino's Tony Montana might be a coke-snorting low-life and remorseless killer, but he's big on honor and family values so the audience can identify with the character to some extent even if we are shocked by his ruthless methods. The film contains some memorable highlights that made it a real winner at the time of its release and it still holds up pretty well despite the dated automobiles and bizarre clothes. The violence is extreme and makes even the most jaded audiences tend to set aside the popcorn and pay attention. Tony has a psychotic, and in due course, murderous jealously of his sister and we are not left in too much doubt as to the incestuous connotations. He suffers rejection by his mother, who regards him as being beyond redemption; surely the hardest of rods to bear for any villain in the traditional mold.We actually start to feel sorry for Tony and EVERYONE in the movie house cheers when he summarily dispatches the Columbian asshole who is about to blow up a target's car with the kiddies on board.My favorite scene is the famous ""bath"" segment , where Tony sounds off at length about the ills of the world while soaking himself in the biggest bathtub in America, coked up to the eyeballs. The message comes through loud and clear: You can have all that money, power, and the woman of your dreams, but if mom won't talk to you, then you're going to be just one sorry pilgrim.Al Pacino dominates the film in a similar manner to the way Eli Wallach took control over proceedings in ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" , but unlike the latter film,""Scarface"" tends to suffer from not having a effective foil for the principle character. However, the supporting players all put in some serviceable performances. Michelle Pfiefer is quite effective as the bored trophy-wife and the other hoodlums are all pretty good. As in all the best gangster flicks, the cops have a minor role to play, and are basically just there to tag along and tidy up after the gangland carnage. Like in those old classics where Jimmy Cagney or Edward G Robinson did their stuff, we all know that that Tony has to get it before the end of the last reel. The finale doesn't disappoint, as he takes his leave us in the traditional style, screaming defiance at his multitude of enemies while blazing away at them with a ""Chicago Piano"". As with Cody Jarrett in ""White Heat"", Tony Montana the loner, doomed by his life-style and lack of self-control, is retired undefeated and unrepentant. A good take on the standard ""down side of the American dream"" theme, and I found the film more enjoyable than the more sophisticated, but convoluted and laborious ""Once Upon a Time in America"" My main criticism of ""Scarface"" is its tendency, probably unconscious, to push the vibe that ""crime may not pay, but its a good buzz while it lasts"". However, its certainly not the only film with that characteristic, and if gangster movies didn't glamorize the underworld to some extent, would we pay money to go and watch them ?R. B.",Scarface
466,huthut85,Best film ever!,10,12 September 2002,"Scarface ,for me is more than a movie! Any film that can be watched 250 odd times and still enthrall has to go down as one of the best. Intense, operatic, melodramatic, overblown and frankly insane! More than any other film, it builds momentum from sceane to sceane, chugging forward from a slow start to climaxe with perhaps the most memorable ending in cinama history. Pacino is my faverout actor, by far, and its a testament to his performance that when I watch it I forget Im watching Pacino - as the tagline goes...""Al Pacino IS Tony Montana"". He becomes Tony. He nails the role in a way no-one else possibley could have.No film has ever had so many memorable quotes - every scene is taut, with such vehement tension - the acting, the script, the music, direction; everything has 11/10 writen all over it.You'll either love it hate it.

But like Blade Runner, it slowly gained a massive cult status and aged like fine wine, finding its place in cinema history. Written by Oliver Stone (who partook in 'method writing' & directed by Brian DePalma, this violent and daring film is a relentless masterpiece, a study in rags to riches, criminality and narcissism to the extreme. Al Pacino is absorbed in this character that we forget its Pacino (the only other actors to do this that comes to mind were Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now). This movie is so early 80s in terms of its look and production design/sets that Miami becomes a character unto itself, just as cocaine the monetary driver in this movie does. The movie plays out like a dream...the events unfold in a surrealistic way, things get more disturbing and chaotic and ruthless as it goes on. The main character and his co-hort are confronted with so many challenges and their daring sacrificial attempts at making it rich at the expense of anything/anyhow/anywhere is sonewhat cool and amusing, all in a disturbing way. The music score is novelty yet epic, and it's no wonder that the rap music culture took heart to this movie due to its romance with violence and brutality and the flexing of money. This isn't for everyone but worth a look- it's one of DePalma's finest commercial films and kudos go to Universal's executives who saw fit to invest in producing this film because it makes sense and gets better with every year that passes. The 4k bluray looks amazing. Technology is so good these days that the amount of film grain seems to be easily controlled. For an old film, this digital transfer makes this film look like its shot in the early 2000s. The hdr contrast and colors are punchy and vibrant and for the first time since its theatrical release, we finally get to see this film as it was intended to be seen in all its miami razorblade glory.",Scarface

474,RLove,The little epic that couldn't,5,21 August 2002,"I had never seen ""Scarface"" before but of course had heard a lot about it. After watching it I have to say that it's a very good vicious gangster movie.  The problem is that it's a very bad epic.The first part of the movie is good, but eventually the movie switches out of the rise of Tony Montana and becomes a sort of morality tale that just doesn't fly.  Every time that the ""truth"" about Tony's world was shown by one plot device or another, my reaction was ""yeah, I know.""  There wasn't really anything interesting in all of it, just a pretentious effort determined to make itself an epic.  The most blatant evidence of this comes in the tagline: ""the world will remember him by another name...Scarface."" This is what I would refer to as epic cheese.  You can't sit down and say ""I'm going to create an epic now.""  The good movie comes first, and if it is done well enough the epic feel results.Scarface has some great stuff in it, but in the end it rings hollow. There's a great deal of high-minded thought and not enough real substance behind it.  The sister is a good example, seeming to transform for no apparent reason, as the character isn't really given enough scenes to develop.  Scarface is the same way--much of it feels more like a highlight reel than a film.  It's what would have happened if all three Godfathers would have been condensed into a single 3-hour film.  The result is disappointing, but it's still something worth watching, if only to get to say hello to Pacino's little friend.  5/10",Scarface
475,Honus1,Pacino's Best,9,9 September 2003,"Though violent, vulgar and a bit over the top, 'Scarface' shows us Al Pacino's best peformance.  The story centers around a Cuban immigrant who comes from nothing to rise to the top of the drug world.  The road to top is paved with treachery and corpses.  Definitely not for the kiddies or the squeamish, Scarface gives us a dark, if not exaggerated look into the cocaine world.  The ever stylish Michelle Pfeiffer teams up with Pacino as his lady, but who finally sees the writing on the wall.  Good for her.  If you don't mind some heavy duty language and bloodletting, Scarface is a real find.",Scarface
476,albert-wayne,A Masterpiece,10,7 May 2005,"I know that this film is hated by some people, but I don't care, I love this movie, for many reasons. The people that hate this movie say that is bad because it is vane, pretentious and over acted, well to me that's just stupid arguments.First of all, the film is not vane and empty, what about Tony's relationship with his sister, I thought that was very good. And also the statement made about the 80s, the hedonistic lifestyle that not just U.S.A but the world lead in that era, how many people like Tony threw their lives down the toilet by getting drunk, high, mixed up in crimes, and eventually killed. This movie has and extra meaning because of my country of birth and my age. I was born and still live in Colombia, and although I was a kid during the 80s, I still remember them and the legacy that still resonates in today's world. During the 80s my country was the birth place of many Tony Montana's, Colombia was THE drug country, and everyone here remembers the times of Pablo Escobar(the biggest drug lord ever, he was bigger than Al Capone) and so I think I like this movie so much is because the life style shown in Scarface was more common here than in the States, here we had very flashy and drug lords that had over the top houses, cars, fashion and all of that, and they were famous, everybody knew of them and their lifestyle, and so I can relate very much to Scarface in the sense that I find it very believable. And I think Pacino acted wonderfully, because that was the behavior of Colombia's drug lords, and so to me he is not over acting. And if you don't believe any of the stuff I just said well then, the movie is also very entertaining, it has plenty of dark humor, action, suspense, drama, and a bunch of other stuff. To sum up my review of the film itself, I think the statement made at the end is very powerful(THE WORLD IS YOURS), it show how the hedonistic and careless behavior of living in excess in every aspect lead to the tragic almost Hamlet like end for Tony Montana, every thing he cared and loved got killed, or abandoned him(his sister, his best friend, his wife, his mother, his mentor, etc.). The film has also a special charm, the 80s charm, I for one miss this era of bad taste and excess, I miss it's fashion, it's music, it's attitude(the world is yours), everything, here in Colombia the 80s were fantastic, because although the drug lords did all sorts of bad stuff, they were also beneficial in the sense that they helped our economy and Colombia saw a huge economical boom because of their huge profits due to the eager drug markets from Europe and the United States, since the drug lords gave lot's of jobs to architects, construction workers, the scene in the movie in which Tony has a tiger in a small island in his huge mansion is great because that was the sort of stuff that drug lords had here(they had birthday parties for their kids in which they gave out t.vs, or beta sets, etc.), and also they had a lot of money, and the spend it in Colombia, so, even thought it was drug money, it was money, and economically speaking, when money is inserted into the circular money flow, the GDP of the country grew, and so Colombia grew and changed from a small banana republic, to a rather big and prosperous country due to drug lords, that finished when the country entered into a recession(a rather chaotic one in the 90s but that's a whole other story), so, as you can see, this is a topic in which I have a great knowledge and interest, and so, I love the movie, Pacino's passionate performance(with a funny accent), and lots of other stuff I have already said.",Scarface

478,pierrefonds_athlete101,"Underrated, imitated and to hip hop artists...an American Classic!",10,8 December 2011,"Scarface had an impact on America at the worst time obviously in the 1980's. It was a rich character study that America wasn't ready for. Pacino's famous line ""Say Hello To My Little Friend"" was his large gun he was preparing for his enemies and viewers must have been afraid of that gun at that time.Now, Scarface is widely appreciated by hip hop artists as an American classic because the film is so ambitious and Tony Montana had a drive like no other man for the American Dream whether it was crime or making it in a world where no rules can be broken. The only way a Cuban could come up in Tony's world was to break rules in a capitalist society and he showed that you don't have to conform to society in order to make it to the top. Viewers, the fact that he is selling drugs isn't the major point. It is the fact that he was jealous and driven to earn money the hard way. A lot of people admire Tony Montana for his drive but because he broke the rules, we lose sympathy for him but we will always admire him in the first act and the final act because he will protect what he has worked for.Pacino has made the role of a lifetime. Sure Michael Corleone was a gangster but Scarface was the ultimate gangster who will be remembered for many of his memorable lines and his accent. Pacino does praise hip hop artists for understanding the movie well. A lot of songs in the hip hop industry have been inspired by this movie and slang such as ""you're soft"" and ""yeyo"" exist around the USA because of this movie.I think the razzies made a big mistake of giving director DePalma the nomination for the worst director of the year. DePalma directs Pacino beautifully. The script goes a little aloof since his ally Manny doesn't have much credit but just muscle to his organization and some back story is just unclear in the world he lives in. Those are two things I point out about the script that I know in script writing formula but in a way, it makes Tony more dominant over Manny but it leaves him with no ally making Tony's world more unpleasant. DePalma's imagery of the glamorous 80's at this point in time will be trending and remembered.Overall if anyone is interested in watching a gangster movie, you will have a good time watching Al Pacino do his thing as he will be compared to such gangster actors as Bogart, Cagney, De Niro, Brando...he basically destroys them all and leaves his mark in the gangster genre.",Scarface

480,irajoel,Scared For Life,1,4 June 2001,"I can't really understand why Brian DePalma felt the need to do a remake of Howard Hawk's 1932 gangster masterpiece Scarface. The original is so good and tough, lean and stark, short and to the point. This laughable mess goes on for an unbearable three hours, and has as its centerpiece, it's anchor, its star, Al Pacino who is simply dreadful. What has happened to this once exciting actor who gave so many memorable performances in the early seventies. His downfall may have begun with this very film, and he has gone downhill ever since. All his recent roles & performances seem the same, they blend and melt into one. His performances have become lazy, fat and dishonest. At times it seems as if his performances are yelled at us, and this is usually mistaken as intense and powerful acting. When he tries to be subtle and quiet,he comes off as insincere and all method. He was fun in Dick Tracy, because he was playing a cartoon, and his overacting was exactly right for a comic strip. His performance was all make-up. His Oscar for the cheap & sentimental ""Scent Of A Woman"" was undeserved, but as Oscar saw it he was long overdue. So in Scarface we have Al playing gangster with a bad Cuban accent which comes off as a bad Mexican accent. DePalma & the screenwriter Oliver Stone have change the Italian criminals of the original to Cubans, and instead of booze we have coke, instead of the fine subtle Hawksian direction of the original we have De Palma's over the edge misdirection. To be sure DePalma has made some terrific original films. Carrie, Sisters, Dressed To Kill and The Untouchables immediately come to mind, but Scarface is not one of them. There is however one top notch DePalmian sequence and thats the chainsaw in the motel bathtub scene, but thats only a few minutes in a three hour flick. The violence and gratuitous cursing wears us out, and after awhile it all becomes meaningless and stupid. I envy Michelle Pfeiffer who in the film gets to walk out on this mess. Also in the cast is F. Murray Abraham, one year away from winning a best actor Oscar and oblivion, & Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who in the flash of a snort goes from being a good sweet girl to a raging party girl,unconvincely I might add.  The film also looks ugly and the recently deceased John A Alonzo's cinematography is muddy and common. Not exactly a highpoint of American cinema.",Scarface

483,so_original,"Yes, it is worth the hype.",9,2 March 2008,"A definitive classic, ""Scarface"" has remained relevant and entertaining to fans, 25 years after its release. It tells the story of Cuban immigrant Tony Montana, played amazingly by Al Pacino. Tony is reckless, defiant, charismatic, and hungry for success in America. He and his friend Manolo come to America, and become involved in the drug dealing business. After a couple of lucrative deals, and dethroning a drug kingpin who backstabbed him, Tony climbs to the top of his empire. He has the money, he has the power. But soon, his decisions affect everything and everyone around him, endangering him of losing it all.Those who say that this film is not ""worth the hype"" are wrong. It is a very lengthy film, clocking in at a little over 2 1/2 hours. But it is worth it. It takes time to allow this story to unfold. One can't go from ex-convict refugee to wealthy drug lord completely overnight. It is a wonderfully written story. From the beginning, you can see the lengths Tony is willing to go to get what he wants. He doesn't feel guilt over killing a Communist to obtain a green card, or doesn't slow down when his friend is murdered in a drug trade gone bad. He just keeps going. Coming from humble backgrounds, Tony has outrageous goals he wants to achieve, such as owning a tiger and stealing his boss's girlfriend Elvira, and building a family with her. However, he proceeds to get these things, because of his bold and driven attitude. But, the film is also a morality tale. The ways in which Tony lives and gets what he wants are illegal, immoral, and unhealthy. The attitude Tony displays often gets him into trouble. This is what ultimately leads to his downfall.The cast of characters are played by talented actors. In the lead role, Al Pacino shines as Tony Montana. He is all at once funny, charming, violent, and brash. He could be considered the bad guy, but he has a way of making you like him. However, you know eventually he will meet his downfall, which he does. Michelle Pfeiffer also stands out in her debut role as Elvira, the bored drug-addicted housewife. On the surface, Elvira seems cold and distant to those around her. But, as the film goes on, you can tell she is a good person who is just caught up in the storm going on around her. Steven Bauer,who plays Manolo, is a great, more light hearted counterpart to Montana and Mary Elizabeth Monstrantonio also does well as Tony's spunky and sweet natured young sister Gina, who eventually gets corrupted by his world, despite his efforts for her not to be.This film has found great popularity among the youth of today, especially those in the hip-hop community. I think its because it speaks to the ambitious dreams of those who come from humble beginnings. Some people want it all, the so-called American Dream, and will do whatever they can do obtain it, such as Tony did. But the question this film poses is : When you get it, are you actually happy? Was it all worth it? ""Scarface"" speaks to the morals in all of us, and is a more complex movie than some give it credit for.And it is definitely in my top 5 movies of all time, by the way. Bias or not, I recommend this to almost anyone, because it speaks to a lot of people. Just as long as you don't mind a lot of profanity or violence, or go into it with great expectations, you should be pleased.",Scarface
484,ballisticwesker-263-233757,"""Say hello to my little friend!!""",10,14 June 2012,"This movie is violent, filled with anti-morality, tasteless and with a character so antihero it would be a character you would usually hate in other movies. But it still got one of the most memorable lines and at times so violent that it is artistic. In this movie Al Pacino is scary, fascinating, violent, antihero all the things you would hate about a man.But I gotta say the movie is one of the most entertaining movies ever made and one of the most memorable ones too. For me this is the movie where Al does his most convincing portrayal of a character, even much more memorable than what he did in ""The Godfather"". Even though ""The Godfather"" is more famous than ""Scarface"" I think ""Scarface"" is a far better movie than ""The godfather"". Even though a grand movie ""The Godfather"" is I think it still gets boring and a little too long where as ""Scarface"" never stops to be fascinating.So yes I think this is a better gangster movie than ""The Godfather"" since it doesn't let go when it first grabs your hands. This is arguable the best and biggest Antihero movie ever made in the history of cinema. If it wasn't Al Pacino playing the lead role I think the movie would have sucked because I don't think no other actor could bear such a character like Tony Montana.Even though very violent and seems to s*** on moral it still doesn't glorify any of the things that Tony Montana does. It actually tells you not to do those things that Tony Montana does in the movie. Why? Because for every evil thing he do there will be a penalty, he does not get away with the bad things he has done in the movie. You think ""oh my god such a waste of life being a man like that"".So yes beyond all that violence and senseless killings (the movie got a lot of them) ""Scarface"" still got a message and moral code. It is not in the violence of the movie you find it but rather after it, when you see what kind of consequences Tony face after what he did. So I can conclude this is a very violent movie and still being able to match today's standard of violence you get in modern movies but still does not glorify violence nor the gangsters and other ""scum"" of life.The best antihero movie ever made in the history of cinema! 10/10",Scarface

Steven Bauer is great but this is the only film i've seen or heard of with him. Loggia as Frank Lopez is another great character. To be honest with you all, Pacino is more better as Michael Corleone in ""The Godfather Trilogy.""

486,objesguy,"Pacino is great, but the rest of the film is overrated",6,25 May 2005,"Oliver Stone has a habit of writing extremely controversial films that are either extremely well done (e.g. JFK) or extremely corny (e.g. Natural Born Killers). Scarface is one of those corny ones unfortunately, even though it seems hard to believe that this film could be mediocre considering it has one of the greatest directors ever at the helm (Brian De Palma), and one of the greatest actors of our generation gracing the main role (Al Pacino). Unfortunately, while Pacino's performance is one of the best (and maybe his most overacted)of his career, the film itself is filled with mediocre performances, a cheesy and linear storyline, and bland, one-dimensional characters that prevent this crime movie from being anything more than a popcorn action flick.Pacino does an amazing job throughout the film playing Tony Montana and truly stands out amongst all the mediocre acting and performances. While Steven Bauer does a decent job as his buddy Manny, Michelle Pfeiffer's character, Elvira, is atrocious. Not only is she a drugged up junkie that is the same character throughout the movie, but she doesn't say anything of significance throughout the movie other than cynical, sarcastic comebacks that make the audience think she is PMSing 24-7. Even her last line in the film is a corny and somewhat uninspired line that has the audience chuckling rather than sympathizing with her, which is just another example of Oliver Stone trying way too hard with his scripts. However, Al Pacino rescues all the mediocre performances with his emotional portrayal of Tony Montana. Throughout the movie, Pacino is passionate in his role, usually screaming everything at the top of his lungs or following anything he has to say with a curse word or two...or three. While at times Pacino does say some lines that have the audiences scratching their heads (which is not Pacino's fault but rather Oliver Stone's), Pacino's performance helps overcome those obscure lines and makes the audience yearn for more.The same can't be said of the story of Scarface however. Despite its great potential, the film' story falls flat on its face, lacking any real depth or any personality at all. Even though Stone and De Palma wanted to simplify the story and dialogue from the original 1932 classic (which was set in New York and about Al Capone), they simplified it too much and thus the story suffered because of it. With everything now simple and quite linear, making the story is easy to follow for the casual viewer; the film still lacks any punch other than the tremendous amount of violence. When the movie comes to a close, the audience feels deprived in a way, feeling as if the film had no purpose or any personality of its own. While De Palma and Stone did accomplish their goal of telling a simple story of an American gangster, they only did a mediocre job. For it is just that: a simply story of an American gangster and nothing else. That may have been fine back in 1932, but compared to other modern gangster films such as Godfather, Good Fellas and heck, even Pulp Fiction, there is nothing Scarface has to stand on its own two feet in comparison to those films.It's a shock to see that a wonderful and passionate actor such as Al Pacino have all his talents go to waste on such a mediocre film. While the movie itself isn't a total lost cause, it is just not a film that truly stands out on its own. Pacino's performance saves it from total doom, but without it, Scarface is nothing more than a cheesy story that could probably be used for a CBS Tuesday Night movie following CSI. However, while this all sounds negative, it is not a total waste and deserves to be seen at least once, just because of Pacino and the action. However, actually buying the mediocre film would be a challenge, especially when the only version on sale on DVD is an expensive two-disc Collector's set.",Scarface

He then lands on the shores of Miami along with his womanizing yet equally as murdering sidekick Manny, respectfully portrayed by Steven Bauer. It doesn't take Tony long to launch his own lethal version of the American Dream. There are many horrific killings throughout the film as Montana carves out his own terrifying niche in Miami's drug trade. Taken in by a local drug lord/Mercedes Benz dealer ( Robert Loggia ) Montana soon finds that his ambition to 'Get what is coming to him.' Which he describes as 'The world and everything in it.' is not without some pretty stiff competition which he is more than up to the task of meeting head on. The main trinket Montana wishes to add to his growing collection is his boss's live in girlfriend played by then newcomer Michelle Pfiffer in an excellent performance as a woman just as addicted to being kept as she is to the cocaine that she continually sniffs. But we never lose sight of Pacino in an engrossing portrayal of a homicidal maniac let loose on a free society after being so long repressed by a regime as terrible as he. The most amazing part about Pacino's performance is how both he and the audience are totally absorbed into the character, at some point you tend to forget that Pacino is in there. Although Montana seems larger than life, you will believe that he has a life of his own. And he takes many lives in this film. To say the violence in many of the scenes is gratuitous is a gross understatement. Often forgotten is Montana's blunt yet clever sense of humor. Just when you feel you can't stomach the gore anymore Pacino will deliver a shining sliver of wit that brings a grin. Interestingly Pacino and co-star Loggia used to dine and hit many of the South Beach night spots while still in character of their Scarface rolls. Like him or lump him Tony Montana has became a part of American culture. I say deservedly so. This is an excellent film. 9 out of a possible 10 T.H.",Scarface
488,alexismaria02,An all time favourite,10,8 May 2020,"This has been my all time favourite film since the very first time I've watched it. There is something truly special about it, something that not many films manage to deliver to its audiences.
Al Pacino is truly amazing in his role as the rising drug ""king"" Tony Montana. From his accent, his voice, his walk to his presence everything is amazing. Every scene he is in is nothing but flawless and this is mostly because he put his whole heart in this particular film and you could totally see it. Then, there is absolutely no one else who could have played Elvira, but Michelle Pfeiffer. She was perfect for this part in every aspect.
The film has the power to keep you ""glued"" to the screen from its start to its memorable and impeccable ending, a quality that not many films have. It is a movie that will never be boring, no matter how many times you've watched it and I know this, because every time i revisit it, I feel more and more amazed by its greatness. Brian De Palma put so much passion in this project and you could feel it while watching the movie, as the shots and the directions were absolutely mesmerizing. The soundtrack is the ""cherry"" of this movie, as most of the music is placed in the right place at the perfect time and it actually makes you feel part of their world.
I truly believe that this is one of the greatest films of all time, as it is flawless in many aspects and this is why everyone should watch it at least once in their lifetime!",Scarface
489,LoneWolf-14,One of the best gangster films of our time,9,20 October 1998,"Pacino gives one of his best performances as Tony Montana, in a film that has about as many trademarks as The Godfather. Hands down, this film is a classic.  One of the 100 greatest movies of all time on my list.",Scarface
490,TGlimm,"Some more cliches, anyone?",4,25 May 2000,"Al Pacino gives a good performance in a movie cursed by cliches. Once you understand the principle of the movie (pack as much graphic cheapness in it as possible) it gets kind of boring. Then again, a lot of unintended comic is produced (eg -SPOILER- when Tony's sister tells him that she had just gotten married to Manolo - right after Tony shot the latter - what a coincidence! How, like, totally tragic!!)All in all, a truly pathetic movie, which kind of diminished my respect for Al Pacino's judgment a big deal. I mean, what's the point of a brilliant performance in a movie with such a catastrophe of a plot?My advice: As with any film with which Oliver Stone is associated, watch this movie as a comedy.",Scarface
491,iljas-94273,My favorite movie so far,10,21 June 2019,"Perfect from the beginning to an end! Unlike The Godfather (which without a doubt is a great trilogy), it's not boring even for a minute. Tony's way from the bottom to the top is rapid and exciting, without boring talks here and then. Al Pacino did an excellent job portraying his character.
Definitely a must watch, if you haven't seen it yet :) - but it does get brutal at some moments, so it's not for everyone.",Scarface

Al Pacino yelling and screaming and angry every second of the movie (exhausting, give us a break, Al!). He is even worse than the many who made a parody of him when he is, exactly, angry and yelling.Bad guys with machine guns. Very scary!Undercover cops, who's not even a cop. Or are they? Good one!Miami (enough said)Greed. Yeah, it's not good for you...Sniffing coke and making bad decisions, then regret when you're back in real life. I saw that one coming...One million bullets and still standing and yelling, angrier than ever (grrrr!)This review is just as bad as the movie, but what are you gonna say. its just terrible.Oh, and I did not check the Yes-box for spoilers.

493,drella666,Like being chainsawed,3,5 April 2004,"A candidate for the most overrated movie of the 80s? Scarface is regularly described as visceral, involving and, above all, influential, but watching it is like sitting through one of those straight-to-VHS action flicks with people like C. Thomas Howell and Frank Stallone.OK - the good stuff first. Pacino is watchable, as he always was before he made Scent Of A Woman. Robert Loggia's quietly effective. And the sets are impressively garish.But there's so much else wrong, and the movie just doesn't convince. Maybe it's because hardly any real Cubans would touch the script, and most of the lead roles went to Italian-Americans (with the exception of, er, F. Murray Abraham). It feels like a Mafia movie (Godfather I & II being the obvious comparisons) done on the cheap.The music is utterly dreadful, especially those unintentionally hilarious stabs when Tony gets jealous about his sister (a character introduced far too late to make psychological sense). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is weak, not helped by silly hair and mauve underwear. Some of the set pieces are incompetently executed - during the riot at the holding camp, during which Tony carries out his first hit, I'm convinced some of the extras are giggling. The disco sequences are like something out of a Jackie Collins movie, or, worse, Basic Instinct. Lots of Caucasians fulfilling stereotypes. Luckily nobody is wearing a Michael Douglas-style v-neck, but it's close.As for the idea that it was influential, sure. On Miami Vice, and that was naff as well.",Scarface
494,ed_metal_head,Very Good Loose Remake,8,28 August 2004,"If one looks underneath the profanity and perceived brutal violence of Scarface, they will find an admirable all-round motion picture. However, for those who have an open mind and are unwilling to dig deep, Scarface is still one cool film.Antonio 'Tony' Montana (Al Pacino) has just arrived from Cuba along with his friend Manolo Ray (Steven Bauer) and about 125 000 other Cubans. It seems Fidel Castro has opened a Cuban port allowing Cubans to go to the United States. Unbeknownst to the U.S. though, Castro has secretly cleared his jails and included prisoners with the refugees (guess what group Tony and Manolo belong to...).Tony is an ambitious person; he wants the world. He always says what is on his mind and does not let people take advantage of him. His attitude eventually lands him a job with Drug Lord Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Lopez immediately takes a liking to Tony, who takes a liking to Lopez's trophy girlfriend Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). Lopez is not greedy; he is happy with the state of his business, but less happy with Elvira's cocaine addiction.As Scarface progresses, it details Tony's rise in the drug business as well as his relationships with his partner Manolo, his sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) -of whom he is overprotective- and Elvira.Scarface is loosely based on the original 1932 Scarface (directed by Howard Hawks and based on real life gangster Al Capone). The talented Brian De Palma (Carrie, 1976) directs the 'remake', written by another famous director: Oliver Stone (Midnight Express, 1978). Stone deserves real credit for his gritty yet accurate depiction of the drug industry. Stone, who was himself struggling with a cocaine addiction at the time, interviewed both Law Enforcement officials and drug dealers before writing his script. The lack of positive characters and an unconventional ending is also praiseworthy since it makes this film into an atypical Hollywood movie.Brian De Palma's direction in this film is slick. While the plot is very violent, the movie shows only some of this violence. De Palma expertly cuts the camera away from some scenes at the last second, showing us the actor's reaction rather than the deed.Visually the movie uses bright colours, with a focus on neon and whites. While this sounds contrary to the dark nature of the character's actions, it fits nicely with the colours of Miami and its people.Lead actor Al Pacino gives an outstanding acting performance that further cements his place as an all time great. Pacino actually moved to Miami prior to shooting this film so that he could learn the Cuban accent and the mannerisms of the Latino people. While Pacino does not have to portray a wide range of emotions, (he is loud and angry throughout) his overwhelming on screen presence and accurate portrayal is Oscar-worthy. The rest of the cast also performs at a good standard, but no person sticks out more than the other does.Scarface is definitely not a movie for people who are easily offended (there may be a record for profanity here), but for those who do not mind profanity (or enjoy it) Scarface has a great plot, great acting and great direction.",Scarface
495,starry-2,An indulgent drug crime rags to riches fantasy.,7,21 October 2019,"This film was too heavy and for some reason not a success upon its release. But like Blade Runner, it slowly gained a massive cult status and aged like fine wine, finding its place in cinema history. Written by Oliver Stone (who partook in 'method writing' (!) ) and directed by Brian DePalma, this violent and daring film is a relentless masterpiece, a study in rags to riches, criminality and narcissism to the extreme. Al Pacino is absorbed in this character that we forget its Pacino (the only other actors to do this that comes to mind were Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now). This movie is so early 80s in terms of its look and production design/sets that Miami becomes a character unto itself. (As is cocaine...the monetary motivator in this film). The movie plays out like a dream...the events unfold in a surrealistic way, things get more disturbing and chaotic and ruthless as it goes on. The main character and his co-hort are confronted with so many challenges and their daring sacrificial attempts at making it rich at the expense of anything/anyhow/anywhere is sonewhat cool and amusing, all in a disturbing way. The music score is novelty yet epic, and it's no wonder that the rap music culture took heart to this movie due to its romance with violence and brutality and the flexing of money. This isn't for everyone but worth a look- it's one of DePalma's finest commercial films and kudos go to Universal's executives who saw fit to invest in producing this film because it makes sense and gets better with every year that passes. The 4k bluray looks amazing. Technology is so good these days that the amount of film grain seems to be easily controlled. For an old film, this digital transfer makes this film look like its shot in the early 2000s, making this more appealing for the most scrutinizing viewer who thinks any movie older than 5 years is too aged and not visually appealing. The hdr contradt and colors are punchy and vibrant and for the first time since its theatrical release, we finally get to see this film as it was intended to be seen in all its south Florida razor blade glory. (Previous versions, from VHS to laser disc to early days of dvd looked and sounded flat). The soundtrack/soundeffects are more hi fi than ever making this a good fit/competitor with films all throughout the last 20 years. I rate the movie a 7 out of 10. The technical presentation is visual: 5 out of 5 and 4.5 for the audio. This film is a good commercial curio done in the spirit of a guerilla indie film. An indulgent crime fantasy to the extreme.",Scarface
496,akpiggott,Exceed to Excess,9,12 September 2004,"Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from ""Scarface"". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled ""American Dream"".Anybody complaining about the ""cheesiness"" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. ""Scarface"" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",Scarface
497,SO_HIGH,Deserves More Credit Much More,10,8 October 2003,"If you haven't seen Scarface then stop reading this review and go out and watch it. I don't care who you are even if you're the wholesome kid next door who listens to nothing but folk and gospel. Get out of your house right now and get a copy of this film. I'm not a ""gangsta"" but to this still is one of the best films today. Pit it against any new film out today and Scarface wins hands down.Now time for the review; Scarface as you know is the story of a Cuban exile that is sent to America. His name is Tony Montana. He is an ambitious man with a very troubled past hence why he was exiled. He takes the ""American Dream"" to the next level. He has a partner with him the whole way named Manny the two starts out as low level gangsters and become the tow biggest drug kingpins in the world. With that said let me tell you why Scarface is a great movie. Scarface is not just a shoot em up gangster movie it actually shows the good and the bad sides to being a gangster. And this film shows both sides not like others who only focus on the bad this film put just as much emphasis on the good side to doing wrong as the bad side. So we have your basic rag to riches story with one catch. Montana is a man so firmly in his principles that he won't let anyone compromise them. We see this from the beginning till the bitter end. Along the way we meet some good supporting characters but this movie is basically AL Pachino's movie. I've seen a lot of AL Pachino's work and a lot of it is good but none of his films come close to Scarface except for the Godfather trilogy and their about equal there. So clearly many people might gasp at the fact that this film is very violent well Oliver Stone did real research and found out that all the violence in this film is plausible. If you take the time to think about it if your were on drugs 24 hours a day and made massive amounts of money selling drugs your going to have to spill blood. The reason this movie truly stands out among other gangster movies is that it gives the audience a chance to see the life of a drug kingpin and one whose one bad a** mother Fu****",Scarface

The story is no worse than any number of gangster flicks, but never ever confuse this movie with The Godfather I or II, or Goodfellas. It is not in the same league.But what makes the film periodically painful to watch is all these Italian Americans swaggering around dropping bad gangsta lines in an even worse fake u'an accent. Pacino would have been great if they could just have dubbed him. I was looking forward to see Abrahams and Loggia, but their steenky accents spoiled the fun.Ah well, the script ain't too hot either.

It's still a hot product, because it's honest and doesn't lie of Geopolitics. Oliver Stone's writing, Brian De Palma's Direction, Al Pacino in the wheel: never goes wrong. It's a film I'm sure Fidel Castro himself enjoyed very much. When Art is done in such manner that makes a documentary camouflage into a fiction, History buffs as myself will always have a nice ride.

Al Pacino was his regular solid self, and Michelle Pfeiffer fairly ordinary which is to be expected. The degree of violence and swearing in the movie was an indication of the direction these kind of movies were taking as the eighties rolled into the nineties.This is another movie you can't help but admire the wardrobe on. The sheer arrogance of the manner the leads wear their clothes allows them to pull off a look that is laughable, yet amazingly stylish. One must applaud such a show. On top of all this, a well directed and written script allows the audience into what is quite likely an accurate portrayal of the Miami underworld.",Scarface
501,groucho_de_sade,"Sleazy, Gross, Disgusting, Sick, Vile, Putrid, Ugly, Repulsive, Repugnant, Trashy, and Just Generally Unpleasant and Nasty",10,24 January 2006,"So why the high rating? There are plenty of reasons to hate this movie: the glorification of violence; the unbelievably misogynistic treatment of women; Al Pacino's patently unconvincing Cuban accent; Giorgio Moroder's music (actually, the pulse-pounding score itself is great, but those early-80s power ballads are worth a few giggles); the stereotyping of Cubans and Colombians. But the violence in this movie really is undeniably beautiful; the women aren't treated any worse than in any other gangster film; Pacino is inspired, clumsy accent notwithstanding, and it's glorious to see him really let it all out (in a performance that I believe he calls his favorite); Moroder's music adds to the outrageousness of the proceedings; and the stereotyping, well... bad on De Palma, but what can I say? This is one terrific story, and it's certainly told well.While the hip-hop ""community"" has chosen to read the film as a morality play for aspiring kingpins, it is in my opinion a satire of capitalism, which ideal is embodied by Tony Montana (Pacino), a bloodthirsty, cocaine-addled killing machine who kills at the slightest provocation. But his violent temper hides a lightning-quick instinct for business, danger, and provocation. It is through this mixture of brutality and brilliance that Tony is able to climb to the top of an utterly corrupt empire, bathing his hands in blood and laughing all the way to the bank. He is a coward and a criminal, but even he knows that he's ultimately no different than any other man of power. He's a businessman, plain and simple. If he had born into an affluent American family, Tony Montana might have been a lawyer or politician. Though public figures (especially political figures) damn Tony's actions for the cameras, they know and Tony knows that he is the purest embodiment of the American Dream. If the American Dream is to prosper in order to ensure comfort, safety, and freedom, then Tony is one of the greatest Americans to ever live. This is the cynical message at the heart of De Palma's film; compare that to the slightly more idealistic message at the core of Howard Hawks' equally great 1932 original, SCARFACE, THE SHAME OF THE NATION.The film starts with Castro opening Mariel harbor and ejecting the ""undesirables"" from Cuba. One of these refugees is charming ex-convict and live wire Tony Montana. Together with his best friend and partner in crime, Manny Ribera, Tony works his way up from the streets of Miami to the seaside mansions of criminal high society. Along the way, the two friends learn how to live the high life, but they quickly discover that the money and power come with a price (don't they always?). Michelle Pfeiffer is Tony's disenfranchised wife, Robert Loggia his early boss and mentor, Harris Yulin a crooked cop, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio his beautiful sister, who idolizes him, and for whom he obviously harbors incestuous feelings. The climax of this film is a tour-de-force, and the photography of the great John A. Alonzo (CHINATOWN, HAROLD AND MAUDE, BLACK Sunday) is outstanding, as are the sets and costumes. Every single scene is an eye-grabbing explosion of gorgeous ultra-80s decadence. Overall, SCARFACE is a masterpiece of suspense and social commentary. It deserves a place among the greatest gangster films of all time. Not until THE UNTOUCHABLES would De Palma top this one.",Scarface

I watched Scarface for the first time today. What a bad joke. The performances by Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer are some of the very worst performances I have ever seen in my entire life by an actor and actress. I actually give this movie a minus 500 on a scale of 1 to 10. I only kept watching this movie to see if it pick up or got better. The movie Scarface only got worse. If actual criminals were actually as stupid as Al Pacino came across portraying Tony Montana then there would be no crime. How could the character Elvira Hancock as played by Michelle Pfeiffer ever be considered to be sexy, desirable, attractive or a sex object? Maybe a dead opossum would be attracted to other dead meat. I feel I was betrayed by the average rating of 8.3 by 454,262. I realize that signs of intelligent life are getting harder to find but 8.3? I will never trust the average rating for any movie on IMDb again. I endured 170 minutes of frustration and total lack of entertainment. It is too bad that Tony Montana was not gunned down in the opening scene and the rest of the movie could have followed the seagulls who were more interesting. Matter of fact, the seagulls were a lot sexier than Michelle Pfeiffer. It will be difficult for me to ever try to watch any movie with either Al Pacino or Michelle Pfeiffer in it.

511,anti_heroi,Scarface is a good experince destroyed by Tony Montana clichês,7,3 April 2020,"A movie that has a interesting propost and mensage, Scarface is a good work when it do a relation with a real historic fact, like the coming of cubans to United States (especially to Flórida) durring the socialist government of Fidel Castro, but it's a big clichê because of the building of the protagonist, Tony Montana. The cuban drug dealer, that build his criminal career in US, has a big different between other character interpretated by Al Pacino, Michael Corleone, of The Godfather trilogy, with his descontrolation and his personally extremally violent and authoritarian. It's like Tony Montana is a comic caricature full of various stereotypes of the bandit, not a reality artistic representation.
Scarface had a good base to be a good movie, but the way how Tony Montana was made destructed all the work. Everything about the protagonist is extreme, his violence and his authoritarism. Nothing is balanced in Tony Montana actions like he hasn't a ration and emotion control, but a supergo in his brain. Obvious the objective of Brian de Palma e Oliver Stone (director and roterist, respectively) was create an Antonio Montana irrational and unbalanced, but it's create a Tony Montana ufanist and alienated. All violence and arrogance that character use to fight in situations are show when the protagonist uses the word ""fvck"" 152 times in movie, showing his violence is not only fisic, but verbal too. The arrogance of Tony Montana transforme in a powerful energy when he think he can fight with the legion of Alejandro Sosa men when the bolivian drug dealer invade Tony Montana mansion, like a super man. Tony Montana isn't an admirable anti-hero, but a disgusting anti-hero, a character that express hate about Fidel Castro regime, who start his government in Cuba in 1959, but he is authoritarian like the cuban leader with all people, including his sister and his friend that died by Tony because of his relationship with Tony's sister.
The age when the movie live was a conturbade period, ideologically and polically. The cold war against URSS/Cuba and the american civil culture with armamentism and racism, the United States lived in an intensive fight. The violence of the movie is contraditory, because, in same time it can be understood like a representation of USA in this time, it's inexplicated (main Tony Montana) because the movie focus more in this violence than in history and operation of crime and its consequence to people, like made The Godfather, the best crime movie of history. The only consequence of crime showed in the film is Tony Montana death showed in a clichê form with the saying ""power corrupts the humans"", when the protagonist dies in his piscine with the saying ""power corrupts man"" that was old Tony boos Frank's piscine mansion. if the movie's mensage are converted to any politic history, for example, the clichês will be the same.

If, for a viewer, Al Pacino's performance was sub-par, so then was Scarface as a whole. Indeed, Pacino's portrayal of a Cuban immigrant and future drug lord, makes or breaks the film, and I'm quite sure both Brian De Palma and Oliver Stone knew this. De Palma did his best to fashion the film around Pacino and, as a matter of fact, he's in every single scene of the film. So, again, if Pacino's Tony Montana irritated you, then you didn't like the film. The thing that amazes me is the way De Palma made this film appeal to so many people. For those of you who can't get enough of shootouts and bloodbaths, here's one for you. For those who love gangster films, enjoy! Stone brilliantly shows Tony's ascent in the drug industry. Personally, Scarface made me understand the workings of the illicit business world more than The Godfather did. Allow me to explain. The Godfather began with The Family already established and illustrated how difficult and competitive that part of the world can be as well as the concept of retribution. Now, I know the Godfather II showed Vito Corleone's ascent, but that just got me thinking: ""Is it that simple?"" Scarface I believe is more patient. It really takes its time. We really see how Tony made a name for himself and how he gets his connections. Apart from establishing Tony's creds and his handling of business affairs, the film is out of control; not in the bad sense, most of the time. From Tony's first job, involving Colombian cocaine pushers to a certain chainsaw, to the last out-of-whack scene, the film just won't let you go. It's smart, concise when it wants to and necessarily brutal. The film would probably not be considered a classic if it was all powdered up and had less blood, gore, swears and drugs than it does. It lives up to its material alright; it doesn't just talk big, it lives big.",Scarface
515,Oliversimpsonuk,Al Pacino best film and my second favourite of all time,10,16 November 2007,"there's only one word for this film brilliant Al Pacino as the legendary Tony Montana who is ruthless, crazy and funny all at the same time some of the lines he says are just amazing (say goodnight to the bad guy and the brilliant say hello to my little friend which both were taken by Scott Hall in his Razor Roman gimmick in WWE) Manny is great as well being Tony's number two guy, Elvira is really good being a long sufferer of cocaine abuse this is a superb film from the legends oliver Stone and Brain DePalma which the best thing about this film is that its a very realistic view on the drug trade in Miami as it is violent, dirty and greedy i will write off saying this is Al Pacino best film and my second favourite of all time (only the Star Wars series beat it)",Scarface
516,nowtheworldisgone,Make way for the bad guy.,8,5 July 2008,"The legendary portrait Tony Montana serves us a delicious movie so that you can't even recognize how the 170 minutes have gone. I particularly claim that the acting of Al Pacino in this film is the greatest ever. If you ask me what the antisocial personality anomaly is than I would show you the portrait, Tony Montana. We face a lot of dilemmas about this portrait. There is always an inconsistency in the behavior of Tony. He makes something that he feels regret for that but at the end he does not compensate for what he did. This is the general actions of Tony which is portrayed by Al Pacino magnificently. What is indisputable is that the accent of Tony is really fantastic which forces you not to believe that Al Pacino is not a Cuban. Who deserves also a great praise is Brian De Palma. His definitions on some scenes are really extraordinary which helps us to state the personality of the hero, Tony. The philosophy of Brian De Palma truly does work in a very consistent way. That is the born, the rise and finally the fall that's all.What is more the contribution of Steven Bauer (Manny Ribera) in this movie cannot be neglected. Let me summarize the brilliance of this movie with some words Faithfulness, Jealousy, Honesty, Love, Money and more",Scarface
517,jamiemamo,The best gangster movie ever,10,20 March 2010,"I feel sick when i read negative things about this movie,I've seen lots of gangster movies and are rated much higher and don't even come close to scarface.What are you people that give a movie like this one star and say its a bunch of crap? acting not good, storyline not good, and the list goes on and on. This is the most realistic ,visious, straight to the point well constructed movie with some off the best lines ever told,the true mind of a gangster, when he looses his temper, when he has to stay solid as a rock,were he will not be afraid of no man and will challenge any opponent that tries to outsmart him or be stronger than him. this movie makes you wake up and be strong and face your toughest moments.the attitude al pacino has is of a guy who will not let you stumble on his foot twice,knows that he can get what he wants,and and grabs every opportunity, what did you expect? where was the acting not good? if you did not like al pacinos performance then you don't know what a gangster movie is all about.Respect,money and a woman to make you complete.even when scarface had a mission to eliminate a person while driving a car and there where kids involved he went with his heart and terminated the whole thing, he didn't care about the consequences that he will have to fight against a strong mafia member,he just went with his instinct although he was a tough guy, he had some good inside off him and didn't let anyone higher than him change his way of thinking, and that is what its all about, thats why he says all that I've got is in this world is my word and my b...s and i don't break them for no one. and he fought till the end. that is what gangster is all about, unfortunately he died. but with Honor, Honor that no other man stepped on him and made him look like a p...y. If you didn like the movie because it was violent or over the top then just watch some stupid dramatic feel good movie that ends with a happily ever after bull...t finish, but if you know what it takes to be in these guys shoes and want a good gangster flick that starts from rags to riches, the real deal then this is for you. But don't hate, in my opinion this tops every other gangster movie,THE GODFATHER was good but tame and GOODFELLAS was good but this is the ultimate trip into the mind of a big time gangster.a perfect 10",Scarface

This is likely Brian De Palma's best directing, and the story along with Pacino's exceptional acting make it one of the best films of the 80's, if not of all time. This is Pacino's finest effort seen, not soon to be matched, and he plays a Cuban superbly. Steven Bauer also does an outstanding job acting, and Michelle Pfeiffer played her role perfectly. The plot was excellent and the music very fitting for the film's setting and era. Scarface isn't a short movie, but it's never boring and the scenes flow perfectly.

The all time drug addicted gangster blood bath X rated(which was very quickly rated R on appeal) film of all time.Scarface may contain the F wordmore than some Resticted combined, but that is not what the movie isabout, its about Al Pacino and the memorable scenes that havecaptivated us for the past 25 years. Yes, when this first came out itwas one of the only X rated theater movies, others with this ratinginclude""Midnight Cowboy"", ""A Clockwork Orange""""Last Tango in Paris""which is now rated NC-17, i don't see why it wouldn't be rated R.""Leatherface""and ""Heavy Metal"" were others rated X. Now getting an Xrating is saying a lot but when you watch this movie you willunderstand right with the chainsaw scene and Al Pacino over the topperformance bringing out f**k 182 times. Al Pacino's Tony Montana(or should i say Oliverstones) is probably one of the most powerful movie characters of all time.Oliver Stone took the script from the 1932 version of scarface and through in blood,chainsaws,a lot more coke,a lot more f**k,nudity, and the most unforgettable performance from Al PAcino. Brian DePalma took Stones script and delivered a memorable movie, this is the film that made DePalma a great director. He later went on and directed the gangster movie ""The Untouchables"" which earned Sean Conery an Academy Award.Pacino is really the only star in this movie you pay attention to because his performance is so over the top but also so real because of how much he puts himself out there and gets noticed. At the beginning Tony(Pacino) seems like a normal guy, like at the beach, but then he becomes a drug addicted psycho. This drug addiction leads to him getting his tremendous power, like he could say""I want guns and a mountain of coke"" and he would get it because he is Tony Montana, the man to live the American dream, but with a vengeance. This is a must see movie if you enjoyed such classics as ""Goodfellas"" ""Godfather trilogy"" ""Once Upon a Time in America"" and ""Mean Streets"".A masterpiece that will not be forgotten. 10/10",Scarface

This movie pretends to be clever and shocking, but what's really shocking is why everyone seems to love it so much.

The story itself leaves me wondering why I should care about these people. After such a dramatic ending, I would like to feel something about what happens to these characters. I didn't see many dimensions to the main characters. They were tough, they were bad, they were amoral, but there was little understanding of why they got that way, or what might have made a difference in their characters.

525,vito7,Masterpiece,10,3 November 2008,"When this movie was released it was bashed by many a critic, most of which have withdrawn their statements or updated their reviews. It is now considered one of the best portraits of American crime ever made. Actually a remake of a Paul Muni classic it is possibly the most quoted movie of all time. In the history of movies it may never escape being eclipsed by the cinematic accomplishment that is the godfather, scarface lands on the opposite end of the spectrum. It is a more kinetic, exciting and darker look at what it is to be a gangster in America. It has been copied by many a movie and referenced in more hip hop songs then could be counted.

I think this film is criminally overlooked! and should be given much more credit, endlessly quotable, This is also, in My opinion- the best movie of the 80's by far!...The Only possible rating I can give this (with the imdb ratings system) is 10 out of 10!!""...Antonio Montana, and what about you, a?, what do you call yourself?""",Scarface
527,Kore-O,The best gangster movie of all time.,9,22 December 2005,"Tony Montana. He is the hardest man to have ever appeared on the big screen. He is the toughest anti-hero of all time. This is Al Pacino's biggest role. The role he was born to play. Scarface is an gangster epic, taking place in the early 1980s in Miami. Tony Montana, is a Cuban coming to the United States looking for money, and glory. One of the most frightening things about Scarface is how true it tells the story, of failed integration in the Western world. It's a perfect example of exactly WHY so many foreigners decides to become criminals. Perhaps thats the biggest point of Scarface.But besides that, the movie gave birth to one of the most memorable characters ever, Tony Montana. Each second that Al, is on screen, he captures the audience. He really makes the viewer think that he is the good guy, even though he is a cold and cynical killer. Oliver Stones harsh script, is certainly not for all ages. Scarface is much more though than just flashy blood and a lot of cursing. Scarface, along with Michael Mann's 1984 cult classic Cop TV series, Miami Vice, represents the 80s through cinema. In the colorful streets of Miami, with the warm sun, the neon lights, the flashy suit, the big hair and the crazy disco pop music, the 80s is brought to life. It's the decade everyone loves to hate. It's that decade that makes you smile. The cheesy and materialistic decade, that yet was innocent and a time full of joy. In a way, the setting of Miami reinforces the cynical aspect of Tonys behavior. It's dark, bloody and gritty in a bright and colorful world.""I always tell the truth. Even when I lie."" - Tony. Thats right Tony. You mates, better go out and buy the DVD, because Scarface is one you just HAVE to own. It's a fact of life.9/10",Scarface

Scarface shows the life of Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and his rise to power that soon leads to his ultimate downfall. The movie is rich in story and character performance. Tony Montana, is shown as a Cuban refugee who seizes the American dream and rises to the top as a powerful drug lord. His pride which was the very tool of his rise to power turns to be his ultimate downfall which makes the character ever more interesting. The action in the movie was glorious especially the final scene as the cocaine driven Tony mows down dozens of hit men before being killed himself.

I first saw this movie when I rented it from my local Library when I was about 11 or 12 years old, I watched it, and I was blown away. Al Pacino plays a refugee from Cuba. He's struggling to earn money, so he starts selling drugs. He starts off as a pretty likeable character, but slowly turns into a monster. Though, he's not a complete monster, he refuses to blow up a car, because there are kids inside. You see a man rise to the top of the world, until his anger and lust for power are eventually his downfall. And who could forget about the shootout scene at the end? It includes probably the most famous movie quote of all time- ""Say Hello, To My Lil Friend!!!""",Scarface

531,vinniejo,Say hello to a rocking flick!!,9,24 October 2007,"Scarface is one movie about which I've heard a lot from everyone who has seen it. I've got extreme reactions from the people who saw this movie. Either they fell in love with it or they loathed it. I belong to the former category.Scarface is a character driven gangster movie about the life & journey of Antonio Montana. Antonio Montana is an anti-communist who is held as a political prisoner in Cuba by Fidel Castro's men. In the 1970's Castro decides to deport all such prisoners to US. Most of them including Antonio (Tony) end up in Miami which is booming with narcotic trade. Tony starts of in Miami as a small time drug dealer, working for the big sharks. He is confident, ambitious & rational thinking person who understands the power equation very well & is also a family man. He rises to the top to become a big shot drug dealer himself. In this process he ends up killing his erstwhile boss Frank Lopez & marries Frank's girl friend Elvira Hancock. He is ably assisted in his rise by his trusted friend Manny.In his hunger for power, Tony becomes overconfident, insecure & a megalomaniac. This subtle change of approach with the rise in money & power is the main theme of the movie as Tony starts losing his rationality and starts distrusting his close allies including Manny & Elvira. He starts making the wrong decisions and ultimately falls prey to his megalomania.Besides an amazing performance of a life time by Al Pacino, the biggest USP of the movie are its dialogues & one-liners. It has got the most amazing one-liners which really come alive when they are said by Al Pacino. It also contains a lot of violence & profanity like in most of the gangster movies. The whole characterization of Tony Montana & the vignettes of his character are superbly written by none other than Oliver Stone. Brian De Palma has also done a remarkable job of bringing out the Tony Montana character like no one else could have done. Steven Bauer & Michelle Pfeiffer who play Manny & Elvira are also pretty good. However, the last fight sequence plays a spoil-sport of some sorts as it is way too unrealistic to digest. And off course don't miss the ""bad guy"" scene at the fancy restaurant. Al has given his fans a real treat in this scene by his superlative performance as a drunkard trying to reflect on his life. I've watched this scene over & over again for uncountable number of times.It is a must watch for all those who love watching gangster flicks & for all the Al Pacino fans.",Scarface
532,the_ghost_in_the_machine,Enjoyable but Flawed,5,10 June 2006,"I finally saw this for the first time after years of hearing how good it was, and though it was certainly entertaining and very watchable, I came away thinking that it's a far from great film. Perhaps having already seen pretty much every other good gangster movie before having seen this one, I kept thinking that the Godfather, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way etc just blow it away... maybe if I'd seen Scarface before any of those, I'd think the opposite. But there are other reasons: More than any other gangster flick, it really is a film of its time, the 80s, which is great as far as it goes, but personally, I found a lot of it too staged and stylised - the scene where Tony goes to kill Frank and the cop coming to mind, it just seems overlong and ultimately disappointing; all you want is for him to go in and blow them away, but it's just really drawn out and then somehow when he does shoot them, it seems like a real anticlimax. I thought all the violent bits - which let's face it, are the main reason for watching a film like this - were all a bit of a let down.Then there's the music... OK, so either you like it or you don't. I personally thought it was awful, and really detracted from the film - and the lowest point is the truly dreadful song that plays over the sequence where they start taking bagloads of cash to the bank... not only is it possibly the worst song ever made, but it actually plays over shots of Scarface talking, in a way that makes it look like a deleted scene from Miami Vice. Whether or not this was an integral part of the film's style didn't matter to me - it just looked and sounded terrible.Finally, Scarface - both the man and the film - were ultimately too simple to be truly satisfying. As a character, he might have balls, as he's constantly reminding us, and his brashness is responsible for the good bits in the film, but overall, it's somehow a bit of a letdown after the manipulative cunning of a Michael Corleone. And as you watch the film, it's so utterly predictable what's going to happen. As soon as you seen Elvira for the first time, it's obvious that Tony will have to get rid of Frank at some point. When Manny mentions how nice Tony's sister is, it's obvious that his feelings for her will lead to his demise. And when Sosa tells Tony never to f*** him over, it's obvious that he will and that that's how the film will end.Having said all that, it's definitely worth watching, and has some great scenes in it; my personal favourite is when Sosa calls Tony a f***ing monkey over the phone, and Tony starts hurling obscenities back at him only to be told that he's hung up. And at the end when he shouts ""You think you can stop me with bullets?"" is somehow a hilarious but also very moving summation of his whole character.",Scarface
533,claytonators,A real classic staring a real actor,10,14 July 2007,"Without a question, the greatest film i have ever watched in my whole life. Al Pacinio is the greatest actor in Hollywood to date.Pacino plays Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who slowly climbs the ladder to become Maimi's top drug king. Montana won't let anybody get in his way, all he has in this world are his balls and his word and he won't break them for no one. Along with his pal, Manny (Steven Bauer), they are about to take this town by the balls.Without Al Pacino, there would be no film. Nobody could have played Tony Montana like Al Pacino.The film can be quiet violent in places and a little uneasy (Watch the Chainsaw bit and you'll see what i mean) but it's Pacino who lights up the screen. Everything he does and says is brilliant. Watch this film because of Al Pacino. Through the whole film you begin to wonder, is he good or bad (There's one scene with two kids in a car that will make you think about that question).Go out and rent SCARFACE from your local video shop and watch it.

Everything else in the movie just fades and pales away. The drugged confused angry self of Pachino as the world he built for himself, the world he rules, implodes around him and sucks everything in, is one of the best performances ever to hit the silver screen. Now I know where Amitabh Bachchan drew his inspiration for Agneepath and Sanjay Dutt drew for Vaastav.From the beginning of the movie, Pachino loads you with a sense of something being odd about him. He is someone who will change things, big time, wherever he goes. His passion, his fire is just too much for everyone around him. As the movie progresses, this fire just rages on and on, wildly and engulfs everything. Finally it engulfs its origin, destroys it and dies out. In some ways it is a bleak reminder of the fact that the final solution is the only solution for a certain brand of criminals.

It is brutal, it is horrible in places. But is is very well written, the action is brilliantly filmed and the acting superb.Al Pacino must have truly loved the script - you can see him having fun with the Cuban accent on different words like 'cock-a-roach'. Also he has something in his eyes that betrays the 'assassin' that is Tony Montana. Also, for all his violence - you cannot help liking the anti-hero.This film also stars a young Michelle Pfieffer and F Murray Abraham.

536,lopezmaggivonkarma,"""Scarface"" (1983) My modest review",6,2 May 2014,"Sometimes, the mere fact of entertaining is enough. This is what happens with ""Scarface"" (1983 ): hugely entertaining and enjoyable, but nor think is the masterpiece which all shout. In its premiere, received enormous negative reviews, but as often happens with many works, and as Tommy Duncan said, ""Time changes everything"". That axiom enthusiastically applied in the film, growing over the years to become a cult. The famous double DVD edition marked the success that it was not his first release. Everyone love the movie; Why not ? people crying: Tony Montana; mountains of drugs is what people crave to see, that fantasy and metaphor of the American Dream is what everyone wants to lookBut if you momentarily abstracts that universe, ""Scarface"" has a facile and affected loading, that hardly combine with the less exhibitionist reality of drug trafficking. It's ""Alice in the Wonderland"", but Heroin and money version. Part of facility moves to aesthetics, a catalog of eccentricities invading. A soundtrack hyper-saturated of sensationalism stylization (the songs ""Vamos a Bailar""; ""She's On Fire""; ""Push It On The Limit""), exotic and flashy suits, Cadillacs, mountains of cocaine, the ""king"" chair of Montana, etc. Blood, black and the white of the drugs are the three primary colors of the film, like a mafia cartoon at its best. Maybe the real problem is the movie length: if the movie was shorter, would win more precision, but nearly three hours where there are many good scenes but easily editable, so there are too much excess. Tony Montana fighting alone at the end of the film WITH ONLY A HANDFUL OF HELPERS is an excess, demagoguery of the script to boost the protagonist as hero or martyrOliver Stone's script for Al Pacino's version takes some elements of the 1932 version eg the obsession with sister, the murder of the husband of this sister, the phrase ""The World Is Yours"", the betrayal of Tony's boss, etc. Oliver Stone's problem is: transfers certain customs and details in a movie that strongly develops interpersonal relationships: in ""Scarface"" (1983) his sister's husband is a close friend of Montana, so the murder was nonsense. In the 1932 version, the husband was more a bully in the service of Tony. In addition, this 1932 film, obsession to his sister could be understood as the custom of those times where the role of women was too restricted, while in the 1983 production is a bit contradictory: as liberal and anti-communist as Tony Montana is so strict with Gina. In Scarface 1932, Tony Camonte was a coward which only had courage when he had a weapon, and that assumption is proved at the end of the film. In the 1983 version, Tony Montana is portrayed as a brave, intelligent and arrogant individual; but yet at the end of the film when he goes to kill Sosa's soldiers, this attitude is not so much like a super criminal individual, but of a vulgar and desperate man taking his last measure for not dieTony Montana is arrogant, says phrases for a poster, he does not care about human life and makes apologist of guns. The problem is not that (ultimately all heroes like Terminator or McClaine do), but ""Scarface"" has two serious problems: one is Brian De Palma , who is unable to moderate the behavior of Al Pacino. Pacino is a great actor, but when he overreacts becomes a parody, and that excess is what happens with ""Scarface"" (1983). But actually the problem of Pacino would not be so terrible if the script did not makes a second fatal mistake. The real problem lethal in ""Scarface"" 1983 is: Stone tries to inject a tragedy where there is none. When an overwhelming person like Montana appears, is necessary to write a good core to his character, and so prepare him for the tragedy. The story of Tony Montana should be similar to that of a monster and a sinister sociopath, but the final quality offered by Al Pacino, De Palma and Oliver Stone is a ""bad guy"" who takes drugs to exhaustionThis review continues on my personal Tumblr (Reviews and the city tumblr), which has no commercial purpose now",Scarface
537,gwitherspoon,Manolo - You Should Have Called Dude,7,12 July 2006,"Since this movie has been dissected to bits by everyone, here are a few trivial observations: Was I the only one who thought that stupid clown Octavio deserved to get blasted? What kind of act was that - a big-headed dancing clown that only someone high on coke would find amusing? The song they were playing at Club Babylon: ""llelo,"" were they singing about crack? Was everyone dancing to some cocaine anthem or what? All of the music was pretty awful and I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to dance to any of it.What was with Gina's afro? Did she and Tony have different fathers? She looked like a white man's version of what a Cuban woman should look like - Puerto Rican/Cuban/whatever - we'll just darken her skin, give her a stupid accent and an afro. If her mother raised her to be an honest, hardworking, respectable young lady, would a few thousand dollars immediately turn her into a coke snorting, ditsy tramp who had no more self respect than to let some ""lounge lizard"" fondle her rear end in a toilet stall? Why didn't Manolo simply tell Tony that he and Gina were married. If he was afraid of him - use the phone. Even if Tony hadn't been such a psycho, he would have still been p*ssed that his best friend didn't think enough of him to let him know that his sister was all right. Manny had the mother worried that something had happened to her. Why didn't they invite the mother to the wedding - why sneak off and wait to be found out? When Gina had the gun on Tony, he seemed like he was enjoying watching her robe open and close instead of being concerned that she might actually kill him. Why did the contract killer blow Gina away first when they both seemed to have the same objective? Why not simply start blasting Tony? If Alejandro Soso could get such a large group of trained killers to invade Tony's estate, why didn't he use some of them to get rid of the politician instead of asking Tony to do it? When Tony's mother was talking to him in her kitchen, why did she say ""We haven't seen you for five years, and then immediately repeats ""five years"" in Spanish - That's right, throw in a couple of Spanish words to remind us that these were Cuban immigrants. The whole speech should have been in Spanish if they wanted to be authentic. She really seemed like a crappy mom anyway for all her talk about ""You give hardworking Cubans a bad name."" What was she doing during his formative years in Cuba? She should have been tough with him then, when it mattered. Even though she apparently attempted to raise Gina ""right,"" she wasn't exactly a credit to her upbringing either.Did Elvira have any parents or friends? How did a seemingly middle class white girl get mixed up with a Cuban drug dealer like Frank in the first place? Talk about a cardboard character, we knew practically nothing about her. Why on earth would she even have been attracted to Tony Montana? Seems like she was better off with Frank.Tony was too arrogant to realize how stupid, uneducated and uncouth he was. When he had lunch at Sosa's house, he was ignorant enough to eat the lemon out of his finger bowl. I'll bet by the end of the movie, he would have done the same thing. His character never evolved from being a heartless, uneducated, cold-blooded thug. That haircut and those horrible, tacky clothes: why didn't someone suggest a different hairstyle for him, or at least tell him where to buy a few quality suits?",Scarface

The accent, music, message are clear and given in an effective way. I can not understand those critics who found Al Pacino's acting in Scarface bad. The posters of the movie are still on the walls. The quotes saying ""make the way for the bad guy"" or ""say hello to my little friend"" are all classic. The relationship between Tony and his sister is depicted in a very sensible way. This is one of my all time favorites. American dream could not be depicted better. The rise and fall of Tony Montana is a lesson.",Scarface

540,deconstructionist,Entertaining but not for the reasons intended,1,17 February 2006,"This movie represents the beginning of Pacino's slide from important actor to self-parodizing caricature. If his performance was deliberately so awful because it was meant to be a metaphor for the way cocaine can destroy self-awareness and render one a manic self-absorbed fool, it would be justifiable but clearly that is not the intent of his performance (which must be distinguished from the Montana character). There can be no question that Pacino thinks he is giving a great performance.This is basically a comic book level effort except the acting and story is not as subtle as comic book characterizations.That said this movie is entertaining and one of the all-time classics of the ""unintentionally hilarious"" genre. That pretty much the same movie has been made hundreds of times on 3% of the budget and with .0001% of the pretension is besides the point.If you love bad movies with formulaic and unoriginal stories, sublimely awful dialogue mouthed by actors who equate histrionics with art and are punctuated with plenty of gratuitous blood and gore for shock value then you can hardly do better than this.

His career in the mobster world may not be found very realistically, however it shows that when you really want something, you can achieve it when going for it 100%.His affection for his sister and his Cuban friend are typical ingredients for mobster movies. However taking a Cuban instead of an Italian for a mobster movie is quite original.Tony's past in Cuba is a guideline for all of his behavior in the rest of the movie, which realistically explains to us how criminals are made.The movie is great to watch and I can guarantee that when you like mobster movies in general, you'll be on the edge of your seat from the start of the movie till the end.*Author's note: My native language is Dutch, so please excuse me for grammatical errors.

Brilliant directing,compelling storytelling, and a great musical score by Giorgio Moroder. This film also has strong supporting acting, especially by Robert Loggia and Paul Shenar.Al Pacino brings fire to his character, as he does to many other roles. The only character that stays out of the way and used as the voice of reason is the mom, played brilliantly by Miriam Colon. Tony Montana starts out with good intentions. He has many dreams.

I love the soundtrack, probably the best soundtrack for any mafia movie.Although it is a classic story of the rise and fall of one man, this basic plot was beefed up with enjoyable substance in between.

And ""fuck"" was really a mainstream word here. I think this film must be included in the top 250...and I must say it really matches Robert De Niro's TAXI DRIVER and all those crap that made it to the Top 250. I mean, this film deserves more than how it was rated. Pacino? He's the best. The story? Nice. The plot? Very Good. The blood, gore, bullets and even Pacino's saliva (which sputtered when he was saying ""fuck"" to the henchmen of Sosa) were like real.

Al Pacino dives deep into the character as Tony Montana the immigrant from Cuba who has been lured by the lifestyle of the riches, gets in the act of becoming rich on whatever the given choice of work, overcoming any kind of obstacle obstructing his vision. One can feel the humane side in him when he cares for his sister so much like a little doll, when he exhibits his uncomfortness and anger on knowing that he is going to bomb the car that has the targets wife and children and his respect for Maama. The scene where he yells at Manny warning him to stay away from his sister, his telephonic conversation with Sosa are some scenes where his powerful acting can be witnessed.As a whole , a great movie and one can only understand actors like Al Pacino and De Niro are definitely the inspirations and encyclopedic reference of acting for actors to come by for generations !!!!!!",Scarface

Given real production values and someone willing to spend time cutting it together properly it could have been a great movie.

Montana goes from a fresh-faced Cuban immigrant to a leader in the drug business. On that path, he ruins the life of his family, his friends, his associates, and ultimately himself.

566,ms_chele7,And that's the way it was!,10,5 February 2002,"Scarface.  Undoubtedly one of the most entertaining movies about gangster life that was ever put on the screen.  I saw this movie when it debuted in 1983.  At that time, the Academy Awards (whom I have very little respect for) snubbed this film.  The feeling then by a lot of people was that it was not a ""politically correct film"".  It denounced and very loudly, everything it could about the government and how drugs were being brought into this country as well.  Another stone cast was about the fact that there was too much violence.  Well, there was a lot more violence being reported on the news in magazines at the time (Look, Life, etc.) than there could have ever been in a fictionalized account of a person who rose to the top with dirty money.  How many people have done this in politics?  Anyhoo, the snubbing by the Academy was aimed mostly at Oliver Stone for writing this story and Brian De Palma for directing it.  By the way, same people who voted this one out did the same thing with the Color Purple and to Steven Spielberg.  Yet another movie that moviegoes loved, but the Academy snubbed. 
Makes you wonder about this country.  I could tell by most of the reviews on the imdb, that most of these people were either not born or were too small to remember all the hoopla around Scarface.  Bottom line:  If a picture tells the truth, is blatant and flagrant about it and it sells a lot of tickets at the box office, it will be a flop at the Oscars. But, if it does all of that and people still talk about it 19 years later, it is a classic!!",Scarface

It seemed to have no real reason why tony did what he did. I need more back story, and some characters like Elvira need more of a reason to be there. The shoot outs where pretty good and i liked the end, although tony was in my opion a shallow character, died in a way that only he couldand the imfoumous chainsaw scene was pitiful at bestI think that it is not even on level with the Godfather 6 out of 10",Scarface
568,hadleya,The movie that wasn't a movie...,1,13 August 2004,"It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone, Brian DePalma, Al Pacino, and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage. It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable, trite, and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time. This movie represents the worst of Hollywood.What is this? Is it based on a true story. Well, they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today. But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine. Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie. The accents are totally fake, and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values. The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show. Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida. Afterall, a palm tree is a palm tree. Is this a romance novel. The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. Is this a drug movie? Well, no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. Admittedly, the acting is terrible.Let's get to the rest. The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show. I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly, the photography budget was excessive. The sound is bleached in a number of spots, and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. The writing is appalling. This is one of those movies were the script writes itself. You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next, each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks.So I am going to ask, Is this even a movie? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. But at least a drama series has some kind of focus. Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together. Whatever it is, movie or not, it is a piece of crap.",Scarface

This film was a little too long for my liking which was around 3 hours. At times it was drawn out some parts took longer than necessary but it was still an overall great movie. Pacino shines as Montana an ex-con who comes to America searching for the American dream. Instead Montana finds drugs, women and guns. At first Monatana is a likable wise-guy, but he succumbs to greed and becomes a Cuban version of the infamous Michael Corleone from Godfather 2.Pacino does the Cuban accent flawlessly, and his immortal words 'Hsai chello to mai leetle fren!' Brings chills down your spine. The amount of times the f-word is used is a little much and he does enough coke to kill a donkey. All in all one of the best movies of the '80's.

Even if you move past the predictable plot, it's so completely uninteresting.Things pick up after that, when Tony starts to make moves and build up his life. The start of the spiral downwards was more engaging as well. But as that spiral accelerated downward my enjoyment fell with it.I can forgive a lack of realism in a movie as long as its internally consistent. Manny opening the door to Tony when he knows his insane overprotective nature is not consistent with anything we'd seen up until then. It's downright stupid. The previous scenes even implied that they were meeting on the down low while he was gone. And then directly following that nonsense we have the final shootout, ending with Tony horribly acted death, for an abrupt, unsatisfying end.",Scarface
575,golgomes,A Gangster Classic,7,2 September 2021,"The movie starts out as a typical gangster movie, with drugs, money, pretty women (and Michelle Pfifer in this might just be the most beautiful woman to ever grace television) and lots shooting. It's the story of Tony Montana (Al Pacino) slowly making his way up to the top of the crime scene. He is brave, always ready to go to the action himself and extremely ambitious. Eventually he does become very rich and successful and manages a massive empire worth millions of dollars.The second half of the movie is more interesting: as Tony manages his new empire eventually he starts losing everyone around him due to his increasingly greedy and ruthless choices to make more and more money. He grows more arrogant and greedy by the day. His empire eventually falls on itself, and his personality which got him to the top becomes his downfall.This movie's screenplay really reminds me of breaking bad, which is my favorite show ever. The protagonist ends up dying in a shoot out after driving away everyone dear to him. He does have a redemption scene where he saves children before eventually dying.The cinematography is ok, it is bland but has glimpses of greatness with some iconic shots such as the final one (looking at Tony's corpse as it pans to ""the world is yours...""), the characters are interesting and the dialogue is for the most part well written, though I could do without the sexism towards Elvira.This movie does produce some of the most iconic lines on film history, and this is one of the reasons for my high rating.

He doesn't budge from his instincts and does things his way.  The way of excess, greed, corruption and street bravado.  This character os one of the best in film history.  Terry malloy, Coreleone, Travis Bickle, Hannibal, Superman.  If superman were corrupted and from Puerto Rico he would be Tony Montana.  The chemistry between Pacino and Steven Bauer as Manny is that of brothers looking for greener grass.  The love they have deep down for each other makes the climax all the more hellish and speaks to the problems these characters go through.
Wanting success and getting it in ways that are ilegal and unmoralistic ultimately lead to death or something close.  That's the message a good one.

583,Brandonjohansen22,You Wanna Play Games?,9,23 April 2007,"Al Pacino lights up the big screen in yet again a near perfect motion picture. Coming off three 5 star films Godfather, Godfather Part II, and Dog Day Afternoon, Pacino keeps the gravy train rolling. Not quite a five star movie in many movie critics minds but definitely an American classic. The way Tony Montana captures the ""American Dream"" in this story about a Cuban immigrant trying to make it in this country is with out a doubt historical. Starting in an illegal alien camp, working his way to washing dishes, and then eventually becoming a multi-millionaire Cocaine Kingpin. Scarface shows you the highs and lows of Tony Montana's life. There is not that many dry points in this movie and in my opinion is spectacular. Scarface is a classic.",Scarface
584,Whackooyzero,"Excessive, violent, and distasteful just like the people it's depicting.",10,3 October 2010,"A lot of people criticize Brian De Palma's 1983 cult classic ""Scarface"" for being a very campy and unrealistic version of ""The Godfather"" and similar crime/gangster films. I am going to be completely honest and say those who say that are clearly missing the point.Scarface is a great film, and one I revisit often because if you take away the reputation it's received since it was released(with rappers and just the related) it truly is a well made movie with some of the best acting in the genre. But I do believe it is necessary to address the aforementioned most common criticism. First of all, the violence in the film(and indeed, the three main shootouts are some of the finest in the decade) is not completely over the top and unreal as some believe because though it is exaggerated slightly, you got to remember gangsters kill people. And people who try to get them are killed often. The movie is gratuitously violent because the characters and their personalities are gratuitously violent. What do you want them to do, pretend this doesn't happen? This is a movie like ""The Godfather"" that is honest about who and what it is discussing. But while ""The Godfather"" was about a family, and how a family in the wrong business can affect the sensibilities and lives of both the family members and the people who are victims of their bloody business, ""Scarface"" is about what happens to a person when nothing matters to them anymore except immediate satisfaction of their deepest, and often darkest desires. Al Pacino's performance in the film is over the top yes, but the character he is portraying can be nothing but over the top because he has no substance in him to be subtle or even fairly human for that matter, and because of that the film contains a classic Pacino performance.The film also hints that perhaps Tony Montana himself isn't totally happy or engaged in what he is doing. The famous scene when he inhales the cocaine face first in the prelude to the finale, shows in a strange way, just how he realizes he ruined his life up to that point. There is nothing left for him at that point. There are scenes when elements of humanity come through though, but it's coming through a man who is a complete and utter louse at this point, and so everything is more extreme than a normal person would have dealt with it.For example, his attempts to protect his sister from losing her virginity by beating any man who makes the attempt, shows how he wants her to be with a good person and be happy, but coming through the disgruntled mind of Tony Montana he deals with it in the only way he knows how: through violence.He also still has certain reservations about himself. He won't kill children for example when a certain kind of mission is presented to him in the film, and he attempts to heal the wounds of his mother after all these years of him being a gangster even if in the way he does comes across as crass and perhaps desperate(even though the visage he adopts is of carelessness). But again that's the only way he knows how to act at this point. You see, Pacino's performance is so good that even though a fair amount of this is only hinted at(though some of it is pretty direct I think) you can see it in his face and hear it in his voice, which is so extravagant it's almost as if he's trying to prove something.The other characters in the film are all there to support Montana, but they are all quite memorable. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Gina Montana is chilling in the role of a normal young woman being abused mentally by her over protective brother, and starts to lose it herself later on. Steven Bauer who plays Manny, isn't a particularly well developed character, but that's because he exists more to help develop the other characters and in that regard Bauer does a fine job. And of course who could forget the beautiful and talented Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira, who in her own way is just as flawed and miserable as Montana, but rather then exploding into drug dealing and violence she implodes in a sense to where nothing she says is exactly what she thinks, and almost seems to feel there's no point to her existence. But it's not only the actors that are important to Scarface. Brian De Palma's fantastic directing showcases each character in memorable fashion and all the faster paced sections are handled well too. And of course Oliver Stone's 4 letter word laden script is vulgar and foul, but memorable and effective providing many classic lines, but I do also want to point out the great soundtrack, put together and composed(partially) by Giorgio Moroder. Sure it's full on 80's synthesized new wave esquire music, but it fits the mood surprisingly well and is fun to listen to with the movie. And the haunting melody at the very end of the movie sums it all up perfectly.I have probably gone on too long, but I wanted to wash away any misconceptions people who perhaps are not sure they want to see the movie either because of it's obnoxious pop culture references and relations or because of common criticisms. I won't say it's the best in the genre(in fact there are many that are better and a tad more focused on story) but certainly manages to blend entertainment(because the story itself is intriguing, and the film is just fun to watch) and message together effectively without over doing either. If you like your mafia movie dark, gritty, realistic, honest and meaningful, then you could do a lot worse than choose ""Scarface"". Check it out.",Scarface
585,JohnnyLongsome,My favourite movie,10,24 February 2012,"Scarface is as much a powerful drama as a fast-paced and violent action movie. The film has reached cult status and Al Pacino makes his biggest role in his career as the greedy gangster Tony Montana. On the way to power Tony Montana sacrifices both love and friendship. The viewer is torn between sympathy and condemnation, and the film touches and captivates from start to finish. A depiction of the little man who declares war on society's betrayal. A film about dreams and hopes for something better in life. A violent and epic masterpiece about a cuban refugee, and his rise and fall as a gangster in the land of opportunity. Scarface is possibly my favorite film of all time.",Scarface
586,eduroca,a great rags to riches epic under the palm trees,10,19 March 2004,"""scarface"" is probably the best movie i've ever seen. with that said, i can only try to justify my words. even though i'm not a big de palma fan, he really stood out with this revision of the 30s classic. however, instead of chicago, we are set in miami as tony montana arrives from cuba as a criminal, and tries to sneak into the drug business to make big bucks. now the performances on this one are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G especially, of course, al pacino's who plays tony montana perfectly and delivers a rather strange cuban accent when he speaks spanish, but in my opinion, that only adds a sense of uniqueness to the character. all the other actors are great as well, especially stephen bauer and my much hated michelle pfeiffer. as in ""the godfather"" this long movie moves on from classic situation to classic situation leaving no room for breath to the spectator. i don't want to give any details about any scene so i don't spoil them up, but i cannot put enough stress on how much i liked this movie. i'll just say one thing: ""say hello to my little friend!!"" totally recommended. 10/10",Scarface
587,notagoth07,Long Live Pacino,8,22 September 2004,"However controversial this film may be, it is most certainly a classic. Al Pacino as ""Scarface"" is a character who none of us would dare to be but all us would like to think we have a bit of inside of us. A true bada**. Never going to be held in as high acclaim as the Godfather and nor should it be, but it is up there as one of my all time favourite movies and is certainly one which i can watch again and again. Brilliant ending also, not many die in a better way than pacino in this movie, ""say hello to my little friend"" dying in the same way that the film had been all the way through, in your face. most swearing ever also, 8.5 out of 10",Scarface
588,nrr817,"You need films like this. You need films like this so you can point your fingers and say ""That's the bad one.""",10,13 January 2014,"I will go ahead and say that Scarface is my all-time favorite film, so this may be slightly biased. Yes, the movie is over-the-top, overdone, and excessive. However, when the tag line is ""The world is yours,"" what other way is there to do it? The movie is supposed to be this way because Tony Montana (Al Pacino) wants it all, as in the world and everything in it.Pacino can be a fireball, and he is nothing short of that as Tony Montana, an overly ambitious, short-tempered political prisoner from Cuba during the Castro-Revolution era. There are 226 uses of the ""f"" word in the film, and Montana probably accounts for 90 percent of them. If anyone else would dare take on such a character with an excessively profane script, which was written by Oliver Stone, the film probably would have been a bust because Pacino did it so well to me and it has become the staple of his career along with Michael Corleone in the Godfather films. The story is also just so incredibly played out throughout the film. I have never watched a film 170 minutes or longer that goes by in what feels like an hour, not even The Godfather or The Godfather: Part II. From the ""political prisoner from Cuba"" scene to the epic ""Say goodnight to the bad guy"" monologue, and of course ""Say hello to my little friend,"" a plot in a film has never interested me so much, not even Godfather I and II.Going back to the ""Bad Guy"" rant, there's a reason why I chose to make my own little ""spin-off"" of it as the title, if you want to call it that. It's my favorite scene in the movie, and it is really the whole point of the film. After having an argument with his wife, Tony is sitting alone in a restaurant with everyone staring at him, and he says, ""You're all a bunch of f*****' ass*****. You know why? You don't have the guts to be what you wanna be. You need people like me. You need people like me so you can point your f*****' fingers, and say 'that's the bad guy.'"" The point being made is that Tony is viewed as a bad person because he is not afraid to be who he is, a short-tempered, overly ambitious man who will not hesitate to speak his mind. So many people in the world are so concerned with being liked and accepted by others, they don't stay true to who they really are and become someone they aren't, and they never obtain true happiness with that person they become, so they judge people who aren't like them and other people they try to be like. Tony goes on to say, ""So, what that make you? Good? You're not good. You just know how to hide, how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I always tell the truth, even when I lie. So say goodnight to the bad guy! Come on! The last you're gonna see a bad guy like this again, let me tell you."" When you watch the other people in the restaurant while Tony is saying this and looking around at them, it is very apparent that Tony is speaking the truth. When Tony tries to look at the people, they simply look straight down with a look on their faces as if they have been found out by the ""bad guy"" who is ""below them.""Moving on to another reason why it's been my favorite film since I was 10 is four simple words, ""The World is Yours."" I truly believe it anytime I read it, say it, or think about it. That's what I think of when I think of the iconic masterpiece that is Scarface, not all of the over-the-top acting, swearing, blood, violence, or the overly flashy suits. Those four words are what inspired rich celebrities like P. Diddy and Shaquille O'Neal to achieve what they've achieved. Those four words sold millions of posters that hang on walls all across the world. Those four words inspire me to be a accomplish great things in my life.To conclude, and make one last reiteration to the title of the review, if you hate the movie for all the reasons I previously listed, which I can understand, ask yourself this. ""Are all those things the only things this movie is about?"" The answer is no. Think with your brain, not your eyes and ears, see the film with your mind instead of your eyes. That's how I came up with my interpretation of the film that it is over-the-top and excessive but that's the way the film was supposed to be, and it was not afraid to be shown the way it is shown. Scarface is the ""bad guy"" of cinema, in my opinion, and I have been a huge fan of the ""bad guy"" for a long time. You need films like this so those people described earlier can point their fingers and say ""that's the bad film,"" or ""it's terrible, pointless, mindless, excessive violence with too much blood, swearing, and yelling."" So, what does that make them and the movies that they like just because their friends and peers like them? Good?",Scarface
589,GetWrekt01,The World Is Yours!,10,31 March 2020,"Now I may be a biased fan of the 80's over the top crime drama and action stuff, but I'll give you this as straight as possible: Scarface is up there as one of the best movies that came out of the 80s. It had everything from cocaine cowboys to Brian De Palma's way of showing violence. From Tony Montana's brash, overconfident personality to Robert Loggia and Michele Pffeifer's beautiful, lively acting.Al Pacino really contradicted himself over here with the Antonio Montana character, compared to his other prominent role: Don Michael Corleone. And it really shows how much work he has put under his acting and accent to get things right. He has his own way of bringing life to a middle-aged cuban spic who most people wouldn't bat an eye on if it weren't for Pacino himself.This movie also does the action sequences the right way instead of relying it all on CGI. The lighting is perfect and really sets the mood for the 80s. The music is fabulous and it is written by none other than the great Giorgio Moroder himself! No wonder that every time someone hears the intro tune, they instantly feel like taking over the world.A very worthy 3 hour watch in my opinion. Also if you liked this movie, you might like The Untouchables as well",Scarface

591,LHG-3,Not so good,7,10 May 2004,"This is a well executed, but nonetheless extremely overrated movie.  I do not see what warrants a status as a classic there.  Certainly, the later Carlito's Way is much better in many ways.  The characters are poorly developed and one dimensional.  The story is not interesting and as predictable as it gets.  I understand that some aspects of Scarface must have been somewhat groundbreaking at the time, but I still suspect that much of its success is due to the hyping of its violence.  The acting is so-so, and Pacino is miscast as an unsophisticated thug and refugee.  The only redeeming value of this movie is its classic, kitshy disco soundtrack. There has to be better latino mob movies.  Carlito's Way is one for sure.",Scarface

The anti-hero Montana is someone with whom we can identify with, because the movie questions how far we are willing to go in order to gain ""the world"".

Al Pacino's character is supposed to be a sort of antihero, and yet i felt relief when that ridiculous Schwartzenegger wannabe shot him in the back at the film's climax. The whole film reeks of a cheesy over the top acting and really bad special effects. I laughed when hector fell through the window onto a concrete colored pillow, when Tony tried to hide his face from the squirt bottle of blood being squeezed at him as his friend was being sawed to pieces, and not to mention Brian DePalma's ""cameo"" during the club assassination attempt. DePalma always soaks his movie in this dark creepiness, which worked for movies like Carrie, but feels woefully out of place here. The film suffers from bad pacing as well, the scene where he goes home to meet his mother could have been cut by ten minutes. The only interesting things i can say about this movie is that DePalma's camera-work is generally excellent (though this is one of his lesser films), but it's his storytelling abilities that makes his films suffer. The 80's- soaked atmosphere doesn't help either. I am baffled by this film's popularity, and hope that true movie buffs can see through the hype and see it for what it is: Overrated.",Scarface

I mean don't get me wrong the directing was good and editing was well done but the story wasn't that great, and I think the movie has gained so much of its status because of all of the MTV rappers and shows where it is promoted so these kids who want to be just like the celebrates buy the film, and are brainwashed to think they should like it because their favorite celebs do.

599,majhiggins,Almost a true classic,8,1 January 2016,"Filled with a truly iconic main character, highly memorable and believable supporting cast and a gripping and gritty story line, this movie is 80% the reverse hero masterpiece of the original 2 Godfather movies. Unfortunately, that is a bit like claiming to be 80% virgin. The problem here seems to be Brian DePalma similar affliction. He is a pretty good director but he thinks he's a truly great director. This is kind of a short range period piece, made in the early 1980s about a story starting in the late 1970s and that's part of the problem. It feels like a film made in the early 80s! Imagine you could find a person who simultaneously knew western cinema but somehow had no idea who Marlon Brando, Diane Keyton, Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Talia Schire or James Caan were and they had never seen the Godfather movies. You show them one and two and then ask ""When were these movies made?"". They couldn't tell you. They are set in a period spanning the 1920s through the 1960s and the cars, costumes and sets show that perfectly but the movies themselves could have been made last year. DePalma unfortunately chose to go with an electronic music sound track and that screws the feel of the piece. Of course, the music from a late 70s disco is going to be laden with that cheesy synthesizer sound and they did mix a few classic non-synth songs into background music. That's totally appropriate but using second generation synthesizers of 1981 to record dramatic background themes for the movie was a terrible call. Godfather's original soundtrack uses instruments and modalities that are timeless and provide no insight into when the work was made. That's why I would love to see this flick respectfully remade into the classic it by all means should have been.",Scarface
600,yilmazk,FAB with a Bad Attitude,10,3 September 2008,"Tony Montana is a FAB with a bad attitude and big enough cojones to make yours drop dead. All his life he has been looking for an opportunity which he finds on the streets of Miami. To him only time stands between him and the world and soon he goes right through the top. Money, Power, Respect, he gets it all only to learn that the hard part is not getting to the top but staying there. Pacino really gives everything he's got in this one and makes the part so his own that one can't help but wonder whether this movie would have been this good if it was someone else playing this role. Rest of the cast do their job really well also, especially Steve Bauer as loyal friend and partner Manny Ribera. The score is just as gangster as the story and there is uncountable amount of classic lines which i already mentioned a few here and there. Between the lines however this is a story about so many things besides selling drugs and killing people. What i love about this film is that it's message is whatever you make it out to be. On one side you can say it almost implies that you have to be ruthless and get what you want because no one's gonna give it to you. On the other side it shows so effectively how sooner or later the consequences of our careless actions catch up with us. It gives a brilliant multilayer message and lets you do the choosing. After all a message is only as good as it's receiver. This film will never get old. In a way it's a film about all of our lives because everyone can watch this film and relate to it whether you are rich or poor, young or old, i'm not sure i should say male or female.

601,jowshihuh,B-film Quality,4,22 May 2010,"In my defense, I was really expecting to like this film. It has, unfortunately, not aged well at all; every scene screams this to me. I'll agree, Pacino can do a mean accent, and I felt fine with his performance. The other actors, unfortunately, fell short. Also, some of the more violent scenes felt like they were forced into the film. It's no secret that the crowds dig unique ways of killing off characters. I have a feeling Stone thought one day, 'Hey, I bet chainsaws would be great,' or 'Hanging from helicopters sounds like the bomb!' and then found his chance to (clumsily) throw that into this film. It's also well known that they dig swearing, so f-bombs are thrown all over the place. Now, I know what you're thinking, and that's that I am offended by all of this. I'm perfectly content with graphic content if it works, but in this case, it just seemed to not fit. At last, to somehow make people think they were watching something more than an action flick, which this kinda is. But wait, how could we possibly end this story. Eureka, I've got it: go Nicholas Sparks on the script! Tony's last day is his worst, and then a skinny version of the terminator does what about fifteen hair metal rockers fail to do, which is sticking bullets in poor Tony's spine. He then makes a dramatic dive down to his fountain, where we meet a motif (which the crowds also dig) and then the film's over. At the end, I think I was supposed to feel sorry for Tony (I mean, the guy doesn't kill kids, so he's good, right?). Overall, the bad slightly outweighs the good (which techno scores are still cool, okay?!), and this ends up only being a mediocre film with all of the elements to draw in the crowds.",Scarface

What makes this movie great isn't its gratuitous violence, which some people may find unnecessary, but it's tale of an average Joe making his way to the top of a drug empire.This movie sported great acting by familiar actors (who doesn't want to see Al Pacino take sweet revenge with high-tech weaponry?), and a great script (might I add was written by Oliver Stone), not to mention amazing camerawork, this movie should have been nominated for an Oscar.Not for the faint at heart, but amazing movie, I'd recommend it to anyone.",Scarface

After a promising introduction, when it looks as though this may be a serious drama, things look up. The early motel shoot out is claustrophobic and well handled, and the infamous 'Chainsaw & Bathtub Scene' is very scary indeed. However, it goes steadily down from there, and as this is over 2 1/2 hours long (on the UK cut), it goes down a long way, to a ridiculous climax which throws all of the tense realism of the earlier scene out the window. Pacino's performance is good as usual, although all he really does is look stoned/shout ""FOCK DIS! FOCK DAT! FOCK YOU, FOCKER!""etc., and supporting performances are good. The film is also very downbeat, so after 2 1/2 hours, you feel really depressed (or bored) watching it. I recommend you watch the film, but stop as soon as you start to feel it drag, instead of waiting for it to get better, as I did. IT DOESN'T.You might like it. But approach with caution:- it's not a classic.",Scarface

The plot started slow and all I wondered was ""Why are they going to tell me this story?""  However, after the motel scene, I was hooked, the story seemed to evolve beautifully.  Al Pacino was brilliant in playing what I believe is the most powerful character he's ever played.  There were certain times that I thought they could have edited some things out, made it shorter.  It just seemed longer than necessary.  However, I definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys Pacino's work, especially ""Goodfellas"", you'll get a kick out of this.",Scarface

In the States Tony starts to work in a cheap restaurant....but Tony has much bigger plans. His ambition is to filthy rich with plenty of women and nice car and houses. He is determined to reach this goal no matter what it takes. Tony gets a foot into the gangster world after a cocaine deal that Tony handled good. Slowly he starts to climb the ladder within the gangster world in California in order to reach his goal.

I expected to see an action filled, mindless, formula gangster movie, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Scarface was a very well acted, well scripted and well directed movie. I do not think that it is in any way a better movie than The Godfathers 1 and 2 or Goodfellas, but I do think that it is a better movie from the gangster aspect. It is a classic story of the rise and fall of a crime kingpin. Al Pacino creates one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema, and Michelle Pfeifer and Steven Bauer, while not outstanding, are solid in their supporting roles.Do not be put off by the fact that Scarface is a very long movie. Tony will keep you glued to the T.V. and itching to find out what he will do next. While this movie does have strong violence, it is nothing compared to today's movies.

621,gabriellapreciosa,SUCCESSFUL MOVIE PRODUCTION,10,5 August 2020,"""SCARFACE"" is an incredible gangster criminal mastermind movie all put together. A man that wanted more out of life, he wanted the American Dream, he wanted Power, Money and lots of it. Tony Montana's Most Famous speech is: ""In this country, you gotta make the money first. Then when you get the money, you get the power. Then when you get the power, you get the women."" They lived in a mindset of living fast dying young, but in reality he was never satisfied his greed ate him alive. The best thing about it is that it is based on a true story of (Al Pacino) a real life mobster named Al Capone, one of the most known crime lords in history. Scarface ends up dying at the end from Geno Silva while shouting ""say hello to my little friend"" referring to his M16 assault rifle before being shot to death. It is a great action film genre having violence, and thriller suspense in an energetic way exploring exotic locations with mafia organizations.",Scarface

Great acting all around, Pacino's best role right after the Godfather.Classic. Look at that pelican flyy! Come on pelican!",Scarface
624,pfate12,Timeless piece of pure entertainment,10,23 December 2014,"I love everything about this movie: the machismo, the bad accents, the music, the characters (even the periphery ones like Nick the Pig or Hector) the clothes, the cars, the dialogue, the setting, the eye candy, the 80s, the decadence, the hot tub, the (underappreciated) cinematography, the violence, F. Murray Abraham, the beach, the montage After a decade of developing his own directorial vision, in the image of Hitchcock, De Palma is at the top of his game with perfect style, pacing and cinematography. Several scenes demonstrate this. First, the very opening shot after the credits. The camera focuses only on Tony seated in the center of a room being interrogated. It circles around the room in a long take, no other face is seen. From this, we are immediately engaged by Tony, his demeanor, his accent, the scar that he bears on his face. He's a bad mofo, hot-tempered, but he's determined and he damn well knows what he's doing. Then there's the buildup to the infamous chainsaw scene. A disguised single shot, absorbing the tension in the soon-to-be doomed drug deal with the Colombians in a hotel room, and then panning outside the hotel through a bathroom window, all the way across Ocean Drive and into Manny's convertible as he clumsily attempts to pick up a blonde bombshell in a bikini, then back up into the hotel bathroom through the window as the brutality begins. Next worth mentioning is the first uninterrupted shot inside the Babylon Club. Hovering over the dance floor for a moment, then following some VIPs as they roll in, and then to Frank's table. The music, the lights, the colors, the people dancing, it feels so natural. There are so many other great shots. When Tony first sees Elvira at Frank's, when he sees Gina getting pulled into the bathroom, the beach and beachside bar in paradise, the approach to Sosa's place in Bolivia. And of course the final take after the shootout at Montana's mansion, reviewing the carnage and futility of Tony's existence. All brilliantly filmed. The over- the-top synthesizer score, hits just the right tone every time, whether tense or somber.The characters, not just Tony and Manny, even those like Alejandro Sosa and Omar Suarez are so vividly illustrated by the script and the close-up shots, memorably performed by Paul Shenar and Abraham. And can't forget Robert Loggia as the Jewish Cuban Frank Lopez or Harris Yulin as Bernstein, the unscrupulous loathsome cop who arrogantly assumes he belongs in the inner-circle of Miami's top drug lords. Finally Mark Margolis as the genuinely creepy and cold-blooded assassin, Alberto. Each adds richness to the movie and their performances compliment, even add merit, to Pacino's hyperbolic portrayal as Tony.I get that this is not for everyone. Some will be turned off by the violence. Others will just laugh at the music and accents. But for real movie lovers, I can't see how this is anything but a supremely enjoyable film, no matter how many times it's been viewed.",Scarface
625,benstevens316,The World Is Yours,7,2 April 2002,"Everyone knows how good the climatic shootout is but on reflection its amazing how average a film Scarface is. The set-pieces are superb but the bits in between chronicling the rise to power of Tony Montana are either mediocre or downwright boring. It takes three hours to tell the story of the Cuban heel while The Godfather took the same time to present a whole dynasty with even the smallest parts containing more depth than Tony Montana.Technically the film is superb, as you'd expect from De Palma, but the film has dated poorly. The music, which although in parts is great (the opening credits and closing credits) can be embarrassingly eighties and I was nearly blinded by the glare of a thousand white suits.Despite that though the film is entertaining and for some reason that I cant explain I love the scene with the goodyear blimp (The World Is Yours). Its a very cinematic scene, complete with a great piece of music, but its a shame that its ruined by the terrible scene that follows complete with an awful eighties song. Personally I'd recommend Once Upon a Time in America for anyone who wants to see a great gangster film about street level crooks.",Scarface
626,udit_sabharwal,It's just not the mafia,8,3 March 2011,To make things clear from the very start. This ain't no mafia amigos so there ain't no class in the film. The sheer beauty of the mafia lies in their simple yet deep thinking brains and strong family values. Scarface is something that is absolutely against all of that. While the movie features Al Pacino who I must commend handles the role with the utmost ease perhaps his portrayal of Michael Corleone cannot seem to get out of my head. Sure he's playing with the big boys now with bigger guns and loads of cash and he's a lot dumber too with a drug addict for a wife. Sure it ain't no Godfather but it is cuban in the making. It is everything the godfather is not and perhaps that is why it loses out on it's class,Scarface
627,strghtshuter,... say hello to my little friend...,9,15 October 2003,"this movie is just great. if you have a chance to see it, then you should run to see it. even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932, Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around. Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great. if you thought that Pulp Fiction was good with the swear words (if you saw it) then you should also see Scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them. (its quite sweet) even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time, not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct, it is still easy to follow along, but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything. personally, i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze, it is really just that great. this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy...

Montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life. The classic phrase: ""Say hello to my little friend!"" is in Scarface.

He doesn't listen to the people in his life, such as his sister, or the woman he loves. He had so much potential, even in an illegal, drug world.

631,christophergob,One of the Best Crime Movies Ever Made,10,30 August 2012,"Scarface, a crime-drama directed by Brian De Palma, is an artistic film that depicts a rise and fall (allegory to classic Greek fables) of a gangster who gets everything, but at the same time, loses everything in his life. This movie has amazing drama, exceptional acting, and bloody, exhilarating action. Al Pacino (The Godfather 1 and 2, Dog Day Afternoon) who plays the avaricious, antisocial Cuban immigrant Tony Montana (who has a scar on his face due to his unknown childhood trauma) who wishes to pursue the American Dream when arriving in Miami, Florida with his loyal best friend, Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer, an underrated actor). He decides to follow the dark side to exceed his prospects. Tony does a hit job on a corrupt politician (exposition) for crime boss, Frank Lopez, who has a soft spot. Thus, Tony starts to escalate. As Tony explains to Manny ""first, you get the money, then the power, then the women,"" he becomes charmed with Frank's cocaine-addict oblivious wife, Elvira (played by Michelle Pfeiffer) and wants Frank gone, so he can take control of the cocaine empire. While Tony is working for Frank, he has an almost incestuous relationship (I dunno) with his sister, Gina Montana and is very protective of her because he doesn't want her to be corrupted. Later in the movie, Tony makes a deal with sadistic cocaine drug lord, Sosa, who tells Tony not to screw him, and argues with his Frank about the deal the he made. Frank explains to Tony that Sosa is a snake and not trust-worthy. Tony doesn't believe this and starts fooling around with Frank's wife. Frank's assassins attack Tony in a luxury club, but he escapes luckily and confronts Frank. Tony kills him for his betrayal and takes over the empire. Tony gets everything, but slowly goes insane when he keeps doing cocaine. His relationship with Elvira falls apart after marrying her. Also, he has problems with the FBI force. Manny secretly dates Tony's sister without telling him. Then, Tony makes another deal with Sosa that they would both solve each other's problems by doing favors for each other. During the climax, Tony has to whack a journalist that could enervate Sosa's business by putting him in jail, but Tony has a sense of morality when he doesn't want to kill the journalist's family when they are in the car with the journalist, so Tony decides not to. Tony fueled by cocaine, later, founds out that Manny was having sex with his sister at his sister's house, and kills Manny cold-blooded. Back at his huge mansion, Tony goes infuriated when Sosa angrily calls him about the failed job. After snorting so much cocaine, Tony has lost a sense of reality, while Sosa's men sneak in the mansion to kill Tony. Tony's sister is killed, so Tony grabs a gun to shoot at the doors of his luxurious office and says the most famous line in the movie, ""Say hello to my little friend"" and blasts the doors open. He starts killing people madly while they are shooting at him. One of the Sosa's top assassins sneaks in the window of Tony's office and shoots Tony in the back. Tony, now dead, falls down into the water fountain on the main floor. There is blood everywhere. The music starts playing as Tony's empire is annihilated. The action in this movie is pretty spectacular because it was influenced by John Woo's action films. There are a few shootouts in the movie: one in an apartment, one in a night club, and lastly, one in the mansion at the end. The moral of Scarface is that people shouldn't take advantage of the American Dream by taking short cuts. Also, the movie also has a message that you shouldn't do drugs since they will corrupt you, just like committing crimes.Oscars it should have been nominated: Art direction Best actor Best score Best director Best picture",Scarface
632,jake-alfg,An All-American Masterpiece,10,6 August 2012,"Tony Montana is a self-made man, with no reason not to live life to the fullest. He would be a Randian superman, except for the fact that his flawed religious thinking ultimately gets the better of him. Luckily, the writers showed how destructive that thinking was.Of the entire cast of characters, Montana and his sidekick are the only moral ones. Sadly, it's a tragedy, and the facet of his personality that is religious derangement ultimately is responsible for the tragic deaths of his sister and best friend.Still, it's a great film with a (mostly) righteous protagonist and some great lines.",Scarface
633,Jack_Blank,Tony Montana! The World is Yours!,9,21 January 2012,"Okay, so this movie is a classic and I don't think anyone will argue with me. Scarface, directed by Brian de Palma, is still considered by many to be the best Gangster/Drug film ever made. It is also probably Al Pacino's most famous role, and of course, it has one of the most famous film quotes ever: ""Say Hello to my Little Friend!""I don't know if you need me to explain what this movie is about, but just in case you haven't seen it, it is about a Cuban immigrant who arrives in Miami with big dreams. He starts at the bottom and works him up to be one of the most notorious Drug Dealers in Miami. Then it all goes into a downward spiral as he succumbs to greed which ultimately leads to his downfall.As mentioned above, and probably known by most, Al Pacino plays Tony Montana (Scarface). What can I say about the acting? Al Pacino is brilliant! One of the best (if not THE best) performances in film history. This movie made him what he is today.The movie also stars Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Tony's Drug Addict wife. I am not a big fan of her, but she is okay, I guess. The rest of the cast is also okay, but your attention is mainly focused on the awesome performance by Mr. Pacino.Furthermore, the movie is also just plain genius. The screenplay is brilliantly written, by Oliver Stone actually and the directing couldn't be better, especially for a film made in the 80s. The music sucks ass, but it actually kinda fits in with the 80s, so at the same time it doesn't suck ass. Ha!In Conclusion: This movie is as violent as it is Awesome, super bloody and the body count almost as high as the number of 'f**ks' in the film, which I think is used at least 200 times. Glad Brian de Palma directed instead of A-hole Oliver Stone. I give at least 9 out of 10! This movie truly is a Cult Classic that will always be one of my favourites.",Scarface

First, Muni is a lot more credible like a half stupid and half brute criminal, who fight in the world where all is possible in the only way that his brain can handle. In Muni character violence is essential and a particular language to deal with a world open for anyone that can handle it. Muni, at the opposite side of Pacino, is very human, human to act and human to die, and he die as his boss die under his hands, how any criminal, in a good tale about moral and the right way to do things define, must to die: praying for his life, defenseless against a society that is a lot more than him. Its not a minor point, in fact its a huge point, the radical difference between Muni shoot dead for policemen without excess and Pacino fighting some kind the little war against numberless henchmen send by a drug Bolivian landlord. A lot more credible is also the Muni sister reaction, who at last just must to recognize the undeniable fact that both are the same because are in the same side of the world, than the Pacino sister with all that twisted incestuous allusion, besides the incredible bad skill with the gun.

649,lindafatale,Cult,10,4 June 2007,"An instant classic, a cult film for every film lover in the world.A film that will stay in the history of cinema for ever, for it's over the top violence, it's crude but sometimes very funny dialog and especially for the performance of Al Pacino, that I consider has one of his best, and maybe the best performance ever given by an actor. I also consider Scarface has Brian De Palma's finest film, from the stock footage opening to the introduction of Tony Montana in a close up all the way to the fall of the character and the bloody final, everything is just perfect, from the light to the music.Scarface for me is one of the few films that people must own on DVD or at least watch once.",Scarface

Surprisingly i found the movie not that great. It was a little to 80's (if ya know what i mean), it was pretty damn long and Al Pacino got a bit annoying, ""joo tink joo can tell me hwat to do?!?!"". Usually people who listen to rap music find this movie pretty entertaining (probably because of the violence) but i bet if you really asked them a question about the movie (why was tony so determined to make it in America? why was he so power hungry?) they wouldn't be able to think of an answer.I'm not saying this movie is bad, heck, it could be your favorite movie,i'm just saying that if you're a person like me then just check it out, it might be your new favorite movie. Al Pacino makes the role seem realistic (thats how good he is) and De Palma did a great job directing.

For its day i was very violent, hell it still is. Even though you don't see anything the Chainsaw scene will still make you want to turn away, but at the same time it has its kinder moments even when its mixed with violence. For example when they put the bomb in the car for the person they need to hit. When the guy they need to hit comes out he has his kids with him. Montana does not want to kill the kids, but the guy who holds the bomb is still planning on blowing them up. Montana gets angry and shoots the guy carrying the bomb because he does not want the kill kids. The only reason i gave this 9/10 instead of 10/10 is because there are often moments where you feel like you've seen them before. Maybe its just me and i need to see it again.",Scarface

This film is top notch and one of my favourites of all time.I have read the book and as always the film does not go into detail in certain areas and this is why it is a 9 out of 10. However, I do sympathise with directors and filmmakers and appreciate how difficult it is to pick the best most influential parts of a book. As it the film is well over 2 hours long so putting in many more scenes would make it to long in my opinion.Brian De Palma has produced some fantastic films and some strange ones to. Carrie (1976) contains one of the freakiest scenes i have ever seen in a film and of course The Untouchables (1987) is a classic gangster movie. I recently read that The Untouchables: Capone Rising is due to be released this year and is currently in pre-production. Due to show Capone moving to Chicago and as the title suggests his rise to the top.As for the film itself, it is in an excellent performance from all (especially Pacino) and even after watching it more than 5 times never fails to keep me gripped and entertained every time. I recommend this film to anyone who likes the gangster genre. It is full of killing, drinking, drug taking, drug buying and selling, money, nice cars, nice houses etc.Watch this film and enjoy it.

Probably the worst caper since The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Could be a promotional video paid by the local drug lords to get poor immigrant foot soldiers into the trade. Leave the barrio son, come to Miami and have just as much fun as the hookers on Hollywood Avenue in ""Pretty woman"". Pick a bikini girl of your dreams. All of them Nordic blondes. The beachfront is full of them, just looking for the worst looking creeps the Cuban prison system might produce. To share the life with in his lush home, a one just slightly smaller than the Versailles. All you have to do is killing as many as you can.

657,matty-tildesley,Brian De palma's finest hour,10,15 October 2008,"Brian De palma can be proud to call this masterpiece his best work. De palma and Pacino combine brilliantly to create a character that you love to hate and hate to love. Tony Montana is dark, sinister and completely obsessed with power and yet he has morals and values that he holds above all. the combination of his deep, captivating and contradictory character eventually lead to his downfall. De palma however does so much more with this film than just a character profile. his portrayal of Tony's rapid rise to the top of Miami's drug empire and his eventual downfall is excellent. Tony's fight to the top is filled with death and betrayal as well as some brutal set pieces. his drive to be boss is a double edged sword as it is both his desire to be more than just another working slack and his insatiable greed that fuel him. his brutal rise is complemented smoothly by the emptiness De palma portrays when Tony is at the top. everything in his life is false from his backhanded bank to the bodyguards who just need a job to his wife who was married to the boss Tony murdered. Everything around Tony Montana is a fake and causes him to drive away his family and succumb to extreme paranoia. all of this truly comes out thanks to a brilliant performance by Al pacino. However what turns this film into a classic is the way in which it portrays the dark side of the American dream although on an extreme premise. Tony is no different from many people who wish to be more than a dish washer or a cleaner but cannot realise that money will jot bring happiness. his greed and power-lust cause his alienation from his family and spark a chain of events that leads to his death. this film has brilliant direction, some brutal and exciting action scenes as well as a good script that has deep powerful themes and a stand out performance from Pacino to pull all these elements together into one of the most memorable characters in film history. a masterpiece and a must watch. 10/10",Scarface

I think this is just one thing which makes Pacino so great is the fact that he can look like either a bad guy or a good guy and he can act like a bad guy or a good guy as well. In Scarface the performance is just brilliant & i don't think there is anyone who could of played the role better. He has everything right from the accent right down to his manerisms and the way he speaks. As a big fan of Pacino i love almost all of his movies (apart from City Hall) & counting out the Godfather Part 1 & 2 i would say this is his best movie & if you are a fan of his or a fan of Brian De Palma watch this movie! It has one of the greatest endings in movie history, has an awsome soundtrack & set the record for the ""F Word"" being used most in a film!

It is the archetypal 'rags to riches' story of a young Cuban refugee named Tony Montana. Al Pacino more than fulfils this role as he conveys the ruthless nature of Montana and likewise the ruthless nature of Miami's Cocaine underworld. Although Montana's ultimate position in life is morally wrong, he is a character with unequalled resolve. DePalma brings the audience not only into the inner recesses of Montana's world, but also the reality of the world that he has built.",Scarface
664,archangel1024,incomprehensible classic,3,6 August 2012,"When I first walked out of this movie in 1983 I thought this movie would be panned. I just finished watching the entire movie again since I last saw it in the theater and I'm sorry, I still don't get it.Robert Loggia was the only believable character in the entire film. I have read some comments about having to overlook it appearing ""dated"". Dated is the last thing wrong with it.If you take out all of the non believable and gratuitous violence what do you have? Essentially a plot and quality of acting you could have expected from an extended TJ Hooker episode.What can be said of Al Pacino' performance that I don't think,(Not having read the over 700 viewer comments), anybody has ever said WHAT was that accent anyway? No Cuban accent I have ever heardtalk about over acting! No other Cuban character in the entire movie sounded like him. I'm curious as to what Hispanic groups thought of Pacino's Cubano Stepin Fetchit performance.By the way, tell me Scarface lovers what is the difference between Tony Montana and Pacino's Big Boy Caprice in Dick Tracy?This is not to say that Pacino could have given a convincing, non comic book performance with the right direction and believable plot, minus the absolutely laughable and implausible violence especially the final battle in the mansion. Talk about implausibility and overacting that was the crème de la crème.I blame Pacino for buying into Oliver Stone's idiotic screenplay and Brian Di Palma's cartoonish direction. I really believe that Pacino and Di Palma quietly would agree with me, after all look what they were capable of 10 years later in Carlito's Way, a great underrated film with a great Pacino performance, brilliant script and direction by Di Palma.If there was a little more of Carlito and less Tony Montana in Tony Montana and whole lot less of Oliver Stone, Scarface would be memorable to me for other than the embarrassing hokey cringe factor.Hey, but what does it matter there are apparently enough movie goers out there that will buy into such mind numbing cartoons even when it wasn't meant to be.I'm sure everyone in- and associated with the film appreciated your patronage all the way to the bank.",Scarface

667,timothy-devereux,Historically inaccurate with many holes in the storyline.,5,11 September 2013,"Scarface can be interpreted in many ways. Some people who like it interpret it as a dark comedy about American excess, characterized by wealth and violence. Others view it as a critique of the American Dream. Regardless of how it's viewed, the movie is overrated.Tony Montana's character arrives in Miami being expelled from Cuba in search of the American Dream. Given an opportunity to impress Cuban crime boss Frank Lopez, he does so and become a vital part of his organization. This part of the movie is not clear. How long has Mr. Lopez been in Miami? If he was part of the first wave of immigrants that arrived in the 60's, it's highly unlikely that he engages in drug dealing. Cuban drug dealers were comprised almost entirely of Marielitos like Tony and not the old guard. Many Cuban immigrants who arrived in the 60's were in fact wealthy by the 1980's. However, their wealth did not come from drug money like the movie implies.After Tony gains power within Frank's organization, Frank sees him as a threat and attempts to kill him with failed results. Tony then kills Frank, along with corrupt cop Mel Bernstein, and takes over his organization. We then see Tony rise to power and achieve the American Dream. This part of the movie skips some broad strokes. Are we to believe that Tony just kills Frank and takes over a drug empire that easily? The movie makes it seem like taking over a drug empire is similar to the Visigoths sacking Rome. How do we know Frank's old customers will deal with Tony? Let's not forget that Tony also killed a high ranking cop with seemingly no consequence. I wish these issues were addressed. It would've added 5 minutes to the movie to see Tony strong arm a customer who refuses to accept him as the new guard or see Tony pay off a few cops to cover up Mel's murder. Once he achieves success, Tony becomes paranoid and begins to lose his edge. Strangely enough, it's his refusal to kill a wife and kid of a politician that leads to Tony's death. What?! Are you really trying to give a monster like Tony Montana a little humanity? It would've made more sense if Tony died because he was trying to subvert power from Sosa. This would go more in line with the underlying theme of the movie, which is greed. The movie is not without its good points. It does touch on a few issues that criminals run into such as money laundering and everyone wanting a piece of the pie. It also shows how wealth can create distance between not only the ones you love, but cause you to become out of touch with reality as well. Tony's paranoia is evidence of this. Because of the films historical inaccuracies and missing pieces, it's hard for me to say the film is good. I know what Stone is trying to do here but he falls short of making a great gangster movie.",Scarface

670,pinkispunknotpimp,"""All I got in this world is my balls and my word.""",9,17 June 2005,"Gangster fan or not, I think there's a little something for every red-blooded American in this flick, Scarface. Trying to think of just one word to describe Scarface is nearly impossible to manage. Controversial, incredible, violent, vulgar, upsetting... all too often does all of this contribute to a classic gangster movie. But Scarface pushes the envelope and brings a whole new meaning to it all.Every scene in this film is drenched in style - - whether it's blood-stained Little Havana t-shirt's worn by leading man ""Tony Montoya"" (played by Al Pacino), the Miami, Florida backdrop, or the seedy attitude of the characters in general. The acting in Scarface couldn't have been more perfectly casted, either. The legendary Al Pacino leads the gang, and he certainly leaves his mark. While the Cuban accent needs a bit more work, just about everything Pacino brought to the table was spectacular. He's one of the key reasons why people still know the name of Tony Montoya. Any other actor casted for the role would have likely been forgotten sooner or later... but not Pacino's Montoya. Steven Bauer acts as Pacino's right-hand man and best friend in Scarface, as ""Manolo"". The chemistry between these two is excellent. Bauer was practically a nobody before he came along in Scarface, which is somewhat surprising considering he comes off looking like top-notch talent with this role. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the role of Montoya's wife, and while not as easy on the eyes as in future flicks, Pfeiffer puts on a pretty good performance. Much like Bauer, she was also an upcoming actor before landing in Scarface. Little did anyone know that in ten short years she would be one of the premiere female actresses in America.Scarface's story is anything but brilliant, but it's definitely not two-dimensional. It's actually quite simple. In the early 80's, Cuban leader Fidel Castro made many Cubans leave their homeland for America. Out of the 125,000 that he sent, approximately 25,000 of them had some kind of criminal record. Among the 25,000 was Tony Montoya. Along with his friend Camolo, Montoya makes a few big hits and gets involved with some major Miami crime lords. In doing this, he goes from being broke to being a very wealthy, successful hit-man. So in short, it's your typical from rags to riches story.Even 25 years after it's unveiling, Scarface still manages to stand the test of time. I just recently watched it over, and I must say that the stuff I found to be daring and controversial years ago still remain daring and controversial today. The acting is superb and well-casted, the action and violence keep the movie going, and everything in between just adds up even further. In the end, Scarface is possibly the greatest gangster film of all time. No exaggeration required. This is a must-see for fans of The Godfather, Casino, Public Enemy, Little Caesar, or the 1932 Scarface!",Scarface

675,gulamali-07196,Highly Overrated,5,31 May 2018,"I enjoy watching classic movies. In a movie market saturated with superhero films fueled to success with CGI effects, the classics often are refreshing with unique plots and fascinating characters. Scarface though, is a highly overrated movie and should not be considered a ""classic."" Scarface lacks character depth, an interesting storyline, and good acting. Gangster life is hard to relate to. Money laundering, prostitution rings, drug dealing, and hit jobs are far from the daily experiences of working a 9-5 and maintaining a social life. However, viewers can relate to characters like Michael Corleone in the Godfather through the dilemmas he faces balancing personal ambition with family politics. We are captivated by the Goodfellas Tommy DeVito who quickly transitions from being playful to murderous. Characters in Scarface are not interesting or relatable because they lack depth. Tony Montana is a predictable overly masculine character. He is willing to run through anyone, anything, or any rules to get what he desire, but predictably like most brutish characters, his nature destroys everything he obtains. Most of the other characters are defined in relation to Tony Montana and lacks interesting traits of motivation. The plot of Scarface is way too simplistic. Montana arrives in Miami and quickly rises to power and then quickly loses it all. This could work with interesting characters in a surrealist genre, but in a movie that frames itself as somewhat historical at the beginning the unrealistic plot (coupled with the laughable accent acting) doesn't work. The acting is also subpar. Don't get me wrong, Al Pacino is one of the great actors, but the role of Tony Montana is not great him. Most '80s Cuban refugees in Miami spoke Spanish especially with other spanish speakers; Cuban accent most characters have to make the movie more realistic and replace Spanish is badly acted and makes the characters too cartoonish. I think this movie receives more credit than it deserves from viewers who drool over gore and are glued to its icon names (Scarface, Tony Montana, Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, Oliver Stone, and Giorgio Moroder). Sure, some of the violent scenes are thrilling and interesting especially the finale with the memorable ""Say hello to my little friend!"" quote, but this just not justify high praise.",Scarface

Great plot, good argument, one of the best directors... but there is something that sends this all to the ground. Maybe it's the length of the film. Maybe it's the flat action, or maybe it's Al Pacino's madness that leads to an implausible final, where a complete unknown character seems to be the star of the film by shooting Montana. And I didn't liked the time lapses: 1 month, 3 months, 3 years... Hopefully the film ended before we had to wait 2 generations till we enter the action. I have to say that visual effects of the actors when getting shoot were really crafted. And that Brian DePalma is one of my favorite directors, but this film isn't what I thought.",Scarface

What makes this movie so masterful is the fact that when you watch it, you become in it. Also, it isn't easy to get an audience to root for a ruthless drug kingpin, but Brian De Palma pulls it off.

In a way, Tony is a violent anarchist, always angry, always wanting more, whether thats money, coke or women. This kind of approach to life is what these guys are after, to be feared and respected. Its amazing to think, a film that was made over 20 years ago is having an effect on the youth today. But it makes me laugh when I see 50 Cent and other rappers trying to act like Tony.Anyway...As for the film, well its genius, to people who haven't seen the film or now nothing about films in general, when you say scarface to them they immediately think of the violence and the drug related scenes that have hung over the films head. But when you watch the film, it isn't very violent, yes it does have short outbursts of violence but not whole scenes donated to it, in a way its more intellectual movie. I'd like to say at this point, I'm not one of those types who are trying to ban violent movies, on the contrary, I love violent films, its just that films like Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction and Scarface have built up these untrue reputations of being really violent when there not.Al Pacino is also amazing in these film, I believe that either this or The Godfather Part 2 is his finest role, but we all now how good how Al is in this movie, so I ain't' saying anymore.The film also does this really cool thing in which the audience has a love/hate relationship with Tony, at the beginning of the film you find yourself cheering him on, but at the end after he kills his best friend, you want him to meet his grisly end.Anyway, enough from me, if you haven't seen it go to your local video store and rent it out.

He works his way up in America, building his own American Dream. He quickly rises through a drug cartel and eventually controls it, holding onto it however, is even harder for him.Goodies include extreme violence (the chainsaw scene comes to mind), excessive gunfights/drug usage, and the usual language and nudity.The film is very, very long, but worth it.",Scarface
681,Zarathustra,"Al Pacino's greatest film, an American epic.",10,30 April 1999,Scarface is Al Pacino's greatest work as an actor.  His portrayal of a Cuban refugee turned drug cartel leader is intense and believeable.  The movie epitomizes the dream of the American underworld and Tony Montana is a Gatsby like figure that is unsatisfied by the attainment of his dream that he pursued so long and hard for.  Michelle Pfiefer as Elvira Pacino's eventual wife and Steven Bauer as Manny his lifelong friend just add to Pacino's rivetting performance.  This movie has more memorable scenes than I could dare to recall.  The passion and realness of Pacino's acting are unparalleled.,Scarface
682,harder,Everything I want in a film,10,30 July 1999,"This is an excellent all-around movie. It has everything I look for in a film.  It is realistic, it has a good storyline, it has interesting characters who are well portrayed, it has action, suspence, and good comic relief. People are discouraged when they see the 2 hr and 50 min running time, but when you start watching it, you won't want to stop, and the hours will pass by like minutes.  Every part of the show is interesting and you won't be bored with unnecessary, uninteresting, and waste-of-time scenes like they have in most 3hr shows. Another unique thing is that at the end of the three hours, I feel  like watching it again.  The time it takes to watch the show doesn't drain you of all your movie watching energy, because it goes by so fast.  It leaves you wanting more, even though it's given you everything.  At the end of most shows you do a great big yawn and get off your couch and stretch and say ""That was  good.""  and then stumble off to bed.  Most shows make you feel tired at the end, and you feel repelled at the thought of watching another movie that day (or that week).  But Scarface makes you feel good afterwards (even though it's filled with disgusting  violence and  excessive profanity). Another good thing about it is Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeifer, the two best actors in the world. So go watch this movie with an open mind  and enjoy it without focusing on the time, and don't dismiss it as soon as you see the disturbing violence and don't try to count all the f-words. Let yourself be entertained and don't think about it or evaluate it  until after the whole show is over.",Scarface

It has a perfect story, actors that give life to the characters, and it's entertaining to the end. Scarface follows the life of Tony Montana (Pacino) as he sails to Miami to be free of oppression from Castro in Cuba. He wants the American dream, money, power, and respect, and he doesn't stop until he earns all three. This movie is pretty violent, but very tame to today's standard of violence. There is also a heavy amount of language in the film, including over 180 f-bombs, most by Pacino. But, this movie is also moderately funny, and you'll catch on to some of the jokes.

The movie has an amazing plot that is entertaining from the moment you start watching the film. Pacino is amazing in this movie, definitely his greatest role ever.

To be honest, it's almost like an episode of Miami Vice, but it's just very very thin overall, one of those movies that if you watch it late at night, while drunk and half asleep it sort of makes sense, but actually it's full of plot holes, awful dialogue, nice suits, terrible special effects and very very forgettable supporting roles.I've just finished watching it, and my overriding impression is that of a coffee advert with guns and drugs.

690,legu-05685,Briliant film with breathtaking plot,9,28 March 2020,"Yesterday, I watched «Scarface» by director Bryan De Palma. The main roles are played by Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer and Robert Loggia. This film is a remake of the movie which was made in 1932. Well, here is my review of it.Firstly, I'd like to point out Al Pacino's acting game, because it's excellent. His character is notable and seems the most real unlike the other ones, indeed. However, in my opinion, I couldn't understand his motivation in it, because Tony Montana's developing from a simple cooker to big drug boss happened too fast. It seems that he was cold-blooded murder so many years before he joined mafia. In other ways, I got no complaints for this film, I liked it.Secondly, soundtrack of «Scarface» is brilliant. While listening this soundtrack , you can feel the spirit of criminal 80-s and it's amazing feeling.In conclusion, I'd like to say that this movie was made on the highest level. And I believe that your feelings after watching it will be unique, and after all, you will never forget them.",Scarface

693,donaldkimmel,A Classic,9,28 April 2020,"I LOVE this movie!!!!!! This movie is a classic. Being a Cuban born in Miami who has parents that lived through this, I have to say this movie was actually pretty accurate. Aside from Al Pacino not being Cuban, even though his accent was exaggerated it was pretty accurate as well. This movie is slow in parts and fast in others and can be a little annoying at times. Al Pacino played this part wonderfully. I gave this movie a 9/10, because there is still room for improvement by today's standards. The only way I feel this movie could have been better is if Tony Montana went to Cuba and killed Fidel Castro himself.
This is off topic from what i was saying before but this movie is a true action movie, it almost got an X rating, because of the violence, especially the scene in the bathroom where they are chopping up Chico with the chainsaw. They had to delete the showing of sawing off his arms and legs, because it was too much, they didn't even include it in the deleted scenes.

This is a real classic, in the same class as De Palma and Pacinos ""Carlito's Way"" (which it's later prequel ""Rise to Power"" should be avoided) and ""The Usual Suspects"". Even if Tony is a bad guy, the character is so well done, and you end up cheering him through the movie. And when Tony ends Manny's life after the rough road they've climbed together throughout the movie, it's tough holding the tears back. This one has got it all. If you haven't seen it, shame on you.

696,whomelordlee,Best gangster film ever? i think so,10,2 October 2006,"I have long been into gangster films but it was only recently that I saw Scarface for the first time. Before seeing the film I would have given Mario Puzo's 6 hour epic the last Don ten out of ten but by the time Brian De Palma's credits rolled it seemed a mere run of the mill flick. Al Pacino is simply awesome as the ruthless yet affable anti-hero Tony Montana and is given more than equally impressive support by both Steven Bauer and Robert Loggia. Blend this with both the beauty and obvious talents of Mary Elizabeth Monasterio and Michelle Phifer and a complete masterpiece could have been the only outcome. Having seen Brian De Palmas other great gangster work, The Untouchables I was of the mindset that it could not have been matched; nearly three hours later I was left to eat my words as the tale of the cuban 'political prisoner' unravelled amongst the backdrop of the Miami underword. My only criticism of the film would be the ending; I was left screaming at the TV for Montana to look behind him as the hit-man approached. Despite this Scarface has easily become one of the best films I have ever seen and I could easily watch it once a week for the next ten years without becoming bored with it.",Scarface

Al Pacino plays a Cuban ""political refugee"" that comes to Miami.  He immediately becomes a hired thug and quickly climbs the Miami mob ladder to become a player in narcotics. Pacino's character's style - take big risks and the f*** with everybody else - leads to success and to his demise.The excesses of the characters made me sick to the stomach.

The dialog is absolutely horrible, with expressions and motto's by Tony Montana, that not only leave the audience confused but are simply idiotic. I know many people who think this is one of the greatest gangster movies of all time. They are the same people who would find comfort in the line,"" Me, I always tell the truth. Even when I lie.""

Profanity, violence, and drugs are in full stock and the tightly plotted screen play by Oliver Stone unfolds beautifully. Al Pacino as Tony Montana is unforgettable, and as the film progresses he sinks deeper and deeper into tragedy until his whole world crumbles on top of him.

I generally like violent, gang/mafia/whatever you would like to call them type movie. I loved the Godfather Trilogy and am enthralled with the works of Tarentino, but Scarface was simply not that good. Its violence was overly dramatic and rare...mostly the focus was simply on Tony Montana, a character who was perhaps meant to inspire hatred or pity from me the viewer. Instead I felt passive; I did not like him, hate him, or care in any way about him. I was in fact more focused on the terrible acting being done around him. Pacino...was Pacino...and well he was the only reason I enjoyed this movie in the slightest. But for his fans I would not call this his best work, not even close to that. Taxi Driver, Godfather 1, Gigli, Scent of A Women, and Donnie Brasco are all better examples of his amazing talent.

715,corey_coyle,The greatest film ever made!!!!!!!!!!,10,24 June 2011,"In my opinion, this is the greatest film of all time. It is my favourite all time film. Al Pacino gives the greatest performance of all time in this film. He plays the ruthless gangster Tony Montana (aka Scarface). The only film that has come very close to this one, is Martin Scorseses amazing masterpiece Goodfellas (that is my opinion).Michelle Pfeiffer gives the best performance of her acting career as the lonely wife of Tonys. Steven Bauer gives a brilliant performance as Tonys best friend Manny. He provides the films most upsetting scene when Tony kills hims. I know Tony felt betrayed by manny sleeping with Tonys sister, but murder was WAY out of the line. Manny actually loved his sister so they could of had a great future together. Tonys sister Gina is played excellently by Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio. Robert Loggia portrays Frank Lopez amazingly. The entire cast is amazing. Paul Gives a scary performance as the evil Alex Sosa.The film is very anti-drugs. It does not glorify cocaine use at all!!! It also has many social messages that any cocaine user should check out. The film stormed a huge amount of controversy upon its initial release. Hardly any film critics gave the film a positive review. I am grateful that Roger Ebert gave the film a full star rating though. He is the most important film critic in my mind. The film was originally rated X by the MPAA. Director Brian De Palma had to censor the film three times. All received X ratings. In the end he brought in a huge panel of experts to view the film and in the end the vote was 18 to 2 of getting the third cut a R rating. However, Brian De Palm submitted the full uncut version with the R rating to Universal, and since they didn't know the difference between the uncut version and the censorsed version, he submitted the full uncut edition.Buy the big 2 disc special edition of this film. The bonus disc contain a 3 part behind the scenes documentary about the detailed history of them remaking Scarface, hiring the cast and the aftermath. There is a short documentary on the TV version of Scarface. Most of the swearing was dubbed over by pointless words which actually made the film really funny and most of the violence was also cut. There is a documentary on how important the film has been in the Hip Hop world. Many famous hip op artists appear in this documentary. It is excellent. There are also loads of deleted scenes (some which are actually quite good). and trailers.I haven't seen the original but I love this film!!!

You learn in the first five minutes how Tony presents himself, with conviction and with a firm personality. He has very few soft spots, and gaining Tony's trust is an unattainable goal. Tony always had one major exposed nerve which led viewers to predict foreshadowing. Don't worry, I'm not about to write a spoiler. Each character in the movie had their own electrifying personality and their own sub-plots and certain (un)predictable spins.

719,sonofoddin,"Deep, intellectual character study, with...guns!",9,14 December 2011,"Usually I'm not a gigantic fan of character studies, although analysing a personality type can be interesting viewing for a period of time, I tend to bore somewhere around the mid-point of the film, I'm left thinking, ""OK I understand that this guy is sensitive... popular or aggressive... but now what? What else can you offer me. Well that where Scarface takes the cherry, It not only delivers a deep, intellectual character study on an internal level but also presents us with an exciting external narrative, a perfect mix between the two, complimenting each other to ensure boredom is never an issue. The film revolves around a Cuban refugee, who after escaping holding camps in Miami, seeks to rise to the top of the international drug empire. Tony's characteristics and actions take the centre stage throughout the majority of the film, admittedly they are some of the most intriguing I've ever seen, more so then any other recent character I can remember. From act one we are presented with this reckless, dominant and highly ambitious man who doesn't seem to feel fear, he has a certain unstoppable momentum about him, incredible stage presence for a character that in reality is just a mere man. Excellent facial expressions throughout adds to Tony's larger than life persona, he looks so calm, almost bored in the mist of drug deals and shootouts, as if reality isn't worthy of his attention. He is one of those people who is never satisfied, they want it all and will do whatever it takes to get it, possessing a certain warped ego that says the world owes it them. Off course as Tony dreams of grandeur are met, his descent into madness truly begins, he slowly becomes more and more detached from himself and any common values, destroying everything he holds dear. I loved this sense of impending doom, every time a major event occurred to Tony I felt this incredible pressure building, one more string snapping in his head. The actions external from Tony's mind were also compelling, an interesting look at the drug running operations and gang culture of the time. All in all I highly enjoyed Scarface, it had enough action sequences to satisfy my bloodlust along with an array of interesting characters to bring meaning and substance to the film. The message portrayed is one to remember, don't obsess over wealth and power, nothing good ever comes out off being overly materialistic, value what's real.. and coke is a hell of a drug.",Scarface
720,pjcorten-278-661234,The story of 'Scarface' is like the story of Al Pacino,1,20 September 2019,"As far as I'm concerned Pacino's rise to the top with The Godfather was followed by his immediate descent into irrelevance with most if not all of his subsequent roles. The guy, or maybe it's the roles he played, is always just so way over the top. His constant ranting and raving just gets annoying. No wonder Michelle Pfeiffer keeps leaving the room. I felt sorry for her for all the nonsense she must have had to sit through on the set. It's sad that she felt she had to take this role just because it was, well, Al Pacino.",Scarface
721,cmndtericlassard,"Not exactly a masterpiece, no matter what you read in ""The Source.""",6,17 March 2005,"Brian DePalma's ""Scarface"" is entertaining, exciting, intense, sometimes very intelligent, and often carried by Al Pacino's captivating lead performance. However, it doesn't live up to the ""Greatest Film in Cinema History"" title that the hip-hop community has bestowed upon it. There are some scenes that look positively cartoonish when compared to some of Scorsese's gangster epics. The cinematography, set design, costumes, and music are all lively and colorful, but sometimes make the whole story seem trapped in cheesy 80s excess. Ten years later, Pacino and DePalma reunited for ""Carlito's Way"", and that film was, in my opinion, even better than ""Scarface."" Sophisticated and genuinely emotional, and not a bit over-rated.",Scarface
722,toivomartikainen,The world is yours,10,24 October 2005,"Tony Montana is one of the strongest characters in the history of film. What makes him even more memorable is the way he is portrayed by Pacino. I've always known that Al Pacino is one of the most intense actor of all times, but after seeing this film I was stunned. He brings out Tony's Latin heritage and the way Tony is fed up with being pushed around so talently that I make myself watch this movie again and again, and never will I be disappointed. Scarface is clearly a movie that concentrates on its main character, but also other characters are brought up nicely. There's Manny, the one who introduces Tony to the circles in the 1980s Miami. He stands by Tony longer than others and all he gets from it is a bullet. The lead lady is played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She is a goal to Tony. When he finally achieves his goal, he doesn't know what to do with it. Another memorable performance is Frank Lopez, a crime boss played by Robert Loggia.Above all, Scarface is a story about how you can achieve anything by believing in it and how power corrupts one very easily if he/she is not careful. It also tells us that it doesn't matter in the end where you come from, but where you are headed. Brian de Palma's directing gives space to Pacino as needed. Oliver Stone's screenplay based on Armitage Trail's novel certainly concentrates on the lead character, but also gives us a good look into the lives of the Latin-American immigrates.Ten out of ten. The best film of the 80s.",Scarface
723,BloodEM,One of the best movies to ever hit the big screen,10,7 December 2005,"At least this is my opinion regarding this movie... One of Pacino's greatest performances and probably one of the greatest performances ever given by an actor. A deep, realistic story, which is also very entertaining, with clever dialogue and many famous quotes. Maybe it's just my point of view, but I feel that even today, 22 years after it's release, this movie hasn't really aged a bit! No matter how old you are, no matter what your favorite movie genre is, you could easily enjoy this movie & fall in love with it. The only problem one could have against Scarface is the fact that it's too violent and.... well.... there is a lot of swearing going on and i mean A LOT. But somehow all the swearing and violence used in this movie have a purpose, unlike in movies nowadays... So my advice is: if you haven't seen it yet, you should definitely watch it... if you've already seen it, watch it again!",Scarface
724,dr_baskerville,The best,10,9 September 2012,"Al Pacino in one of his stellar performances. This film was absolutely slaughtered by the critics when it first came out and is now a classic, shows what the moronic sheep that are the critics know.The over the top, colourful operatic direction by Brian De Palma and the perfect acting from all involved. The production design is a feast for the eyes. Eberybody quotes this film and its real treat by Oliver Stone for supplying some of the most memorable lines ever.""Scarface"" is a movie where there's always something going on. Its ultra violent, but the over- the-top language, the humor, make it very fun to watch. Once again, Al Pacino is genius here, at his best. You can sympathize with his character, because he probably never had a proper education and was never really taught what's right and wrong.

726,jules_winfield94,Excessive and violent. The ultimate gangster picture.,5,20 March 2005,"Over the years I have found that it has become something of an off and on trend to bash this movie, mostly because of this movie's off and on popularity. I can understand why it is bashed too. People find it too abrasive and over the top, perhaps even mean spirited. These are valid criticisms of course. The first time I saw Scarface I was quite taken aback, but not in a good way. There are many movies that fit that description, yet people don't seem to linger on any of them, perhaps because none of them are anywhere near as popular as this particular movie. When a movie a minority of people doesn't like gains particular noteriety they have a tendency to resent it even more. I know this for a fact. I hate 'Titanic' with a fiery passion. A lot of people do. And all of these people - including myself - seem to find that it's their duty to tear the sh*t out of that movie. Does that make it a terrible picture? The fan-base sure doesn't illustrate that. In fact the fan-base completely debunks anything we have to say about it. It's the same with 'Scarface'. Why do people like it? I guess it all comes down to their inherit tastes. For some this movie is just too violent and vulgar, for others these factors don't even play into their approach to the movie. I think this movie has maintained it's popularity over the years mostly because of Al Pacino's performance. He created an iconic image for this sort of character that has been copied time and time again. It's not his best performance, but it still packs a hell of a punch. Sure the exposure on this film is ridiculous. I'm not fond of the idea of drinking coffee out of Tony Montana's head or in the case of my friends Scarface welcome mat, scraping mud off on his grizzled, cigar chomping face. What's next, 'Scarface' condoms? Imagine it: ""Say hello to my little friend...c'mon woman stop gawking and help me out here"". Is this movie worthy of all this marketing and merchandise that has been created in it's name? I'm not one to judge really, I'm writing this while sitting in my Cock-a-roches t-shirt. I have a hat that says ""The World is Yours"". Is this movie worthy of embossing it's way onto our collective chests and heads? Check it out in another ten our twenty years and we'll see. In the meantime here are seven reasons that I like the movie (be weary there may be spoilers): #1) It's an excessive movie about excess. It's about how indulging in every vice that life has to offer, and how extreme the consequences can be. The scene where Montana dives into the mound of coke illustrates this perfectly. ""Nothing exceeds like excess"" - Michelle Pheifer as Elvira #2) Structurally it's built in a very Shakespearean manner. The characters, especially Tony, are all on a collision course with one singular fate: Destruction. Everyone Tony meets with the exception of Elvira (the only one smart enough to get out while she still can) seems to meet their end directly or indirectly at his hands. In his own way Tony is a modern Macbeth. His own insecurities, paranoia and ambition lead to his downfall. #3) It's so stylized. You argue that it looks like a TV movie with a big budget, but lets face it, everything in the 80's looked that way. The cinematography reflects the bright lights, bad music , bad hair, coke and boose nature of the decade. #4) The dialogue is realistic. I've met people like this before. They do swear quite a great deal. They can't help it, it's part of the way they are brought up, it's part of their character. So in that way, it's part of Tony's character. #5) Tony Montana is an unredeemable character. It is compelling to watch the course of his disgrace and destruction play out. He is so driven and amoral, brutal and unforgiving. Watching his story play out is the equivalent of watching a head on traffic collision. You can't look away no matter how hard you try. Suffice to say, it is a very entertaining traffic accident. #6) The brutality. This is the staple of the movie. Argue you may that it is gratuitous and over the top, but the mere fact that you argue this proves that the film succeeds. The violence is in your face and extreme, there is no subtlety in it. The reason the violence is like this is because Oliver Stone and Brian De Palma were trying to open everyone's eyes to the pitfalls of this lifestyle. You may live big, but at the same time your going to die big. You'll go out with a bang, literally with a bang, with your blood and guts all over the wall. #7) ""The World Is Yours"" This phrase repeats itself numerous times throughout Scarface. For me it asks a really important question: ""How far are you willing to go?"" Tony Montana was willing to go as far as possible, not caring what had to be sacrificed to accomplish his dreams, including himself and everyone he loved. Even his sister, the one pure thing in his life was taken from him. The one person who could possibly redeem him is swallowed by his greed. In the end Tony gains all, but loses everything. It's not the greatest movie by any means, but it a definitive flick. I would give it an 8.5 out of ten.",Scarface
727,martin_scarface,"At last, in the Top 250, where it really belongs",10,29 April 2005,"I have never seen any gangster movies with the Scarface genre before so when my dad brought one I immediately watched it.The soundtrack at the opening lines (the introduction) was superb and suited the movie's plot. Like a mysterious sound of hate. Next came he introduction to Tony Montana, which left me wild-eyed, since I like the grittiness of his character (""what the f**k is wrong with this guy meing"").Next came he introduction to his life in the resettlement, his back-breaking job in a hotdog shop and finally, when he met Omar Suarez and was told to do business with Colombians. The scenes in which Angel Fernandez was killed by a chainsaw and when Tony finally got the ace up by shooting them all dead (and in the head)was nicely filmed (really looks like GTA--Vice City) Every piece of this film, mentioned or not mentioned, marks the climax of gangster movies (rivalled only by Carlito's Way, another underrated film) and is a masterpiece.

728,charlesbrosky,just incredible,10,5 June 2005,"This is by far the best movie I have ever watched in my life. Al Pacino has gotta be the best actor. The way he plays Tony, you would never think he was anything BUT a Cuban refugee. I can watch this movie every day and not get bored of it. Most other movies always have something in it that could be different, or mistakes in it that you wonder how it could have gotten past the directors and editors, or something that just doesn't make sense. But this movie, in my opinion, has absolutely no loose ends! The single thing I didn't like about it was Manny's accent. It sounded too fake, and it just annoyed me every time I would hear it. Although I was upset Tony killed him because of the obvious reasons, I was a tad relieved that I didn't have to hear that accent anymore. I didn't understand Tonys mom. Why would she turn her only son away. No matter what he has done, you don't turn away a child. ESPECIALLY when he is throwing that kinda cash at you!! Hell, I would love for my kid to give that to me, regardless of how they got it. To sum it up, this was an absolute masterpiece. No other movie could be better than this, and they just don't make movies like this anymore.",Scarface
729,pengembara-sepi,The Real Tony Montana and Al Pacino,10,2 March 2014,"good movie to watch, and not bored to watch it again and again, because No romance in this film, drama and also the most important action. So those of you who have not watched it please immediately and instantly watch, and those of you who've seen it, can watch again. and there is a bit of advice from me,The main merit of this film is its unrelenting portrayal of the criminal life. The camera somehow manages to maintain a sense of the headstrong stupidity which Pacino captures so well, accentuating the unpredictable and ruthless attitude of the protagonist. In no way does the film attempt to soften or to justify Tony's extreme and for the most part imprudent actions. He is not a good guy who has to do a couple of violent things to stay on top. From the beginning, he is a sadistic idiot, and as he says in the chillingly great restaurant scene, he is the bad guy. He is stubborn to the end, and it is partly his inane impenitence that makes his character so memorable. This is the way the film remains suspenseful, as well, because the audience never knows what this crazy guy is going to do next. The ending, while I won't spoil it, fits perfectly with his character and the film refuses to withhold a single blow from its audience even here in its dying throes. The reason this film is great is because Tony is not a hero, but a villain, and furthermore that it never condescends to give him any heroic traits. The movie itself is as ruthless as Tony, and it is the masterful relationship between film and character in this film that combines to leave a lasting impactScarface is one of the best films ever made, Al Pacino is a true classic!Makes you wonder -- has anything from them -- been learned today?",Scarface
730,gazzaa2,The Ultimate Gangsta film - Pacino at this best,9,2 September 2005,"When Scarface first hit cinemas, the general consensus was that it was a poor film, too overly violent and a waste of time. The Cinema was full of walk outs on it's first showing and the critics blasted it. Now those same people and same critics pinpoint it as one of the leading and popular gangsta films and one of Al Pacino's best and most memorable performances.It's the classic rise and fall tale of a big time gangster which was Cuban Tony Motana a 'political refugee' played by Al Pacino. The shoot out at the end and various quotes throughout the film are legendary but the film goes along at a nice smooth pace with a great soundtrack. The violence is hard hitting from the start and can come at any time, which always leaves the view on edge and sets the tone and never dragging.The film has everything and is superbly directed by Brian De Palma and is second only to Scorsese's superbly directed 'Goodfella's in terms of gangster direction. Tony Montana has all the leading male qualities and Pacino holds the screen brilliantly whenever Montana has a line (literally).Probably the film of the 80s",Scarface

735,semmert724,THE WORLD IS YOURS,10,20 July 2018,"""Scarface"" (1983) was produced by Martin Bregman with others and directed by Brian De Palma, who is known in the crime drama, psychological thriller and suspense genres. Tony Montana is the hero who was a Cuban refugee in Florida who becomes a drug kingpin through greed and violence, only to see his empire end due to his egotistical behavior and cocaine addiction. Villains appear throughout the movie because they keep getting killed off. The principal villains who last the longest are Frank Lopez then Alejandro Sosa after Lopez is killed by Tony Montana. Tony is called to adventure when he refuses a low-paying offer with low risk for a high-paying risky cocaine buy that turns out to be a trap. He survives the drug-deal ambush that was set-up by Omar Suarez and possesses both the money and the cocaine that Tony was supposed to buy. Montana then leverages his position to a successful meeting with Omar's boss, Frank Lopez. Brian De Palma's aesthetic for well-placed violence is in its full style with ""Scarface"" (1983). The amount of violence seemed excessive for some at the time and it spawned much imitation, the highest form of flattery. I never thought that the quantity of violence in this movie was too much, but it was the quality of violence that was disturbing. From the villain's henchman being lynched from a helicopter to the hero surviving being hit with small bullets only to be killed by a single shotgun blast from behind showed things that had never been seen before in cinema.The final challenge for Tony Montana is when he must try to survive (without his best friend) a hit squad that was sent to his mansion by the Colombian drug lords. He is internally tormented by the regrettable effects of his desires, be it a cocaine habit, wasted wealth or the deaths of his loyal friends and his sister. Tony Montana's original aspiration of wanting to be the top dog climaxes into a parable about extravagance and obsessions. This, combined with the director's strategically-placed ferocity throughout the film culminates into the final anxiety release of seeing Montana floating dead, face down in his indoor fountain, ironically under the golden sculpture (that was alluded to earlier) that says ""The World Is Yours."" This business model's ROE ratio of 1.82 (domestic) and a Box Office almost twice the budget, ""Scarface"" (1983) is a successful movie venture. After 1983, excessive violence-as-art spawned whole new ways of showing interesting ways to kill people. It's not that this Everyman has a preference for killing others in weird ways, he just finds himself in odd everyday situations (for a drug dealer) and reacting violently in his journey. The ""Scarface"" imitators have mostly enjoyed their killing, for Tony Montana it's just the cost of doing business. Al Pacino knew that showing happiness or sadness after any death would just complicate the character. Because of this insight, most everything the charming Pacino touches turns to gold.",Scarface

Also, Al Pacino made Tony Montana in one of the most iconic if not THE most iconic mobsters in movie industry.Little about Tony Montana and hes personality.Tony is a ruthless man who will do anything to raise to the power. He is cunning and he will rather do hes business alone then hire somebody to do hes dirty work. Tony also has over-protective relationship with hes sister Gina. Tony's best friend is a guy called Manny and later he is married to a women named Elvira. It is hard to believe but Tony has some morale in him. He does not kill women and children.My favorite scene in the movie is the dinner scene (say good night to the bad guy scene).This scene perfectly shows Tonys fall. Hes wife Elvira hates him, she can't giving him a child because Tonys life made her in a addict, hes days are becoming more and more the same, he lives in the mansion who is more of a prison then home, he is becoming more and more paranoid, etc... Elvira said it perfectly ""Can't you see... what we're becoming, Tony? We're losers. We're not winners."".The movie ends with Tony being killed and he falls in the pool and above that pool is a replica of the World and on that replica it says ""the World is yours"" showing the irony of hes life IMO.The acting from the whole cast is awesome.

738,codyagraval,Great Film........,7,16 May 2007,"It took me three sittings to watch this film, I don't personally like it. But don't let that deter you. It is one of the best films I have seen.It couldn't have gone wrong, really, when you have the mix of Brian de Palma directing, Oliver Stone writing, and of course Al Pacino acting (and throw in there Michelle Pfeiffer to sell it further). It delivers on direction, with that unmistakable retro look, and cinematography was great at times. The acting was great from start to finish, Al Pacino sells his Cuban character really well (that's an understatement) and supporting actors do a fantastic job, too. The set designs and the locations, as well as the music, really do a great job in bringing the story to reality. It is amazing how the film, with all these sets and all the big names, was made for only $25 mil. I like to think, for that reason, that it is slightly art-house (you can argue with me there) in that its concept and quality really strays from the typical Hollywood film we know today (if you compare the calibre of films Hollywood made in the 70s and 80s, and the different types of film we see in today's Hollywood you'll notice the artistic difference (again; you can argue that)). Its box office receipts do reflect this, and so the budget was perfectly set to set the film up to make a profit.The script is where I start to be divided. On one hand it is fantastic; elements of the American Dream are strong, and the character development of all the key characters is brilliant! The realism in each characters lines is priceless. The only quibble I have with the script is that I found it to be quite formulaic. I thought for the caliber of film it is the script could have taken a chance and branched out from the typical plot structure and realised a greater artistic appeal (with albeit a lesser commercial appeal). When you compare it to the Godfather I & II for example, the difference and quality of plot structure is quite evident. (Granted, the Godfather films were based on books, and these films' particular religious adherence to the books makes its plot structure more appealing, and is one of its greatest selling points.) For me, the formulaic script was an annoyance which slightly flawed the whole film. However, I am definitely the minority on this point, and I stress that with every other facet of Scarface, it is a high quality and entertaining film.",Scarface

When I got my shirt online, it had a picture of a guy's face and the word ""Scarface"" written on it. I had no idea what that was. So I checked online, did some research. found out it's a movie - a 1983 American crime directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. 
 And it was amazing!
 This movie tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana who came to Miami, United States in 1980s. At the beginning, Tony was just a punk on the street and worked with a local drug dealer. Every time he finished the dirty works on time,so his boss appreciated him and put him on the top. He become the first right-hand man of his organization. At the same time,he got much stronger and more powerful, he was addicted to drugs. However, he was not satisfied. He took a big deal with Venezuelan drug dealers. And then he killed all the people that he didn't like it. It was too late that his boss realized that Tony betrayed him. So Tony took the boss out of the game and took charge of all the drug businesses in Miami. After that, Tony began to become suspicious of the people around him, even his wife,young sister and friends. In the end, he was shot by haters, but continued to taunt until he was fatally shot from behind by a shotgun blast. His body fell into a fountain below, in front of fountain reading "" The World Is Yours"".
 In the years that followed, this movie has received reappraisal from critics. A bunch of people said Scarface is one of the best crime movies ever made,especially in the gangster genre. The movie has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in rap, hip hop music, comic books and video games. One American rapper- Nas released the album "" The World is yours"" in 1994.
 In my way, I think this movie is talking about the American Dream. Tony came to U.S. with nothing, and he started his own business. Even though he did a lot of bad things, he's living his own life, he does whatever he want to do, and became the person he wants to be. I really admire him in some way. He was working hard for his business, did all the things is for his family,friends. I really like this big man. He would pay anything instead of his life for his poor family. Those people who from the hood, they love their family numbers.Based on the movies, I learned a lot things. Lesson number one: Don't underestimate the other guy's greed.Also, don't be a paranoid person, trust issues is the most important things in friendships. Lesson number two: Don't use drugs in your life, not even try it. If you addicted to drugs, you will lose the person who you love, and your family numbers. In the end, I really like this movie, it's a perfect example of gangster movies.",Scarface

741,brunowangrc,This movie is amazing,9,20 June 2018,"The first time I ever learned about the movie Scarface was when I bought a T-shirt from the Supreme online store (First I wanna say that this brand releases every Thursday morning only, and all the stuff they sell sells out in like 1 or 2 minutes - for example, a T-shirt I bought online, the original price is $30-$40 at the online store, and some real popular ones can sell for like $100-$250; do it; you'll make easy money ; that's why a lot of young people like this brand and like doing this). When I got my shirt online, it had a picture of a guy's face and the word ""Scarface"" written on it. I had no idea what that was. So I checked online, did some research. found out it's a movie - a 1983 American crime directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone. 
 And it was amazing!
 This movie tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana who came to Miami, United States in 1980s. At the beginning, Tony was just a punk on the street and worked with a local drug dealer. Every time he finished the dirty works on time,so his boss appreciated him and put him on the top. He become the first right-hand man of his organization. At the same time,he got much stronger and more powerful, he was addicted to drugs. However, he was not satisfied. He took a big deal with Venezuelan drug dealers. And then he killed all the people that he didn't like it. It was too late that his boss realized that Tony betrayed him. So Tony took the boss out of the game and took charge of all the drug businesses in Miami. After that, Tony began to become suspicious of the people around him, even his wife,young sister and friends. In the end, he was shot by haters, but continued to taunt until he was fatally shot from behind by a shotgun blast. His body fell into a fountain below, in front of fountain reading "" The World Is Yours"".
 In the years that followed, this movie has received reappraisal from critics. A bunch of people said Scarface is one of the best crime movies ever made,especially in the gangster genre. The movie has been referenced extensively in pop culture, especially in rap, hip hop music, comic books and video games. One American rapper- Nas released the album "" The World is yours"" in 1994.
 In my way, I think this movie is talking about the American Dream. Tony came to U.S. with nothing, and he started his own business. Even though he did a lot of bad things, he's living his own life, he does whatever he want to do, and became the person he wants to be. I really admire him in some way. He was working hard for his business, did all the things is for his family,friends. I really like this big man. He would pay anything instead of his life for his poor family. Those people who from the hood, they love their family numbers.Based on the movies, I learned a lot things. Lesson number one: Don't underestimate the other guy's greed.Also, don't be a paranoid person, trust issues is the most important things in friendships. Lesson number two: Don't use drugs in your life, not even try it. If you addicted to drugs, you will lose the person who you love, and your family numbers. In the end, I really like this movie, it's a perfect example of gangster movies.",Scarface

746,nabeelkazim,Definitely one of my top 10 flicks of all time,10,28 December 2006,"Its one of the best gangster classics. Oliver Stone, Al Pacino and the master De Palma - what do you expect? Forget about the top notch thrilling scenes and focus on Pacino's and Robert Loggia's dialog! Its an Oscar movie but not the Hollywood style. Excellent direction, casting and story that is different than untouchables, Godfather or good fellas. Pacino's character can be compared to Frankenstein. A truthful, honest and brutal monster that you will sympathize with. Don't let any comments spoil the surprise; just watch it. It will knock out the white sand out of your Funky brains. A must see and own on DVD; not for tasteless KIDZ though!!! You know what I mean? Trust me.",Scarface

So many unbelievable plot points , the whole movie is set in a town where basically no police no law enforcement , they can kill the boss , and virtually kidnap his wife , and the next day she is Pacino's girlfriend and everything is fine , no questioning from nobody , because everything is happening in there gangster world where just no police :) .

Hollywood bs only at the last scenes, but that does not flat the wow to digest after the show.Good movies are hard to find and when i see one, i am happy to rate 10/10.",Scarface

Even though the movie has extensive violence and language it only shows the life these people have to go through and shows the intensity of their lives. I think the movie has a good concept in it saying that doing this isn't the best life to live. Oliver Stone shows what a great writer he is mixing the old version into the new in very subtle ways. Although there are some instances in which you can see the old version in some ways, I personally do not think of this movie as a remake of any kind. This movie if anything is all its own.",Scarface

757,belladonna-8,gotta love it,9,3 August 2006,"This is a fabulous movie that you can watch over and over again. Tony Montana is the 'displaced person' made good, only to lose it all.He's fast talking,gutsy,heroic- and not a little paranoid by the conclusion of the movie. Al Pacino is perfect in this role and embodies the glitz of Miami as well as the violent personalities which inhabit this drug underworld. The depth of his performance makes you actually want him to win and to escape his terrible end. It's bizarre that he can be, in some ways, an admirable person- perhaps because his adversaries are far more unlikeable and a lot less charismatic. I might add that the scene combining a chainsaw in a bathroom is an horrific masterpiece- (bathrooms and chainsaws are not a good combination). The more I watch this film, the more noticeable seems the uneasy quality between Tony and his sister, Gina- nothing overt,but.... Michelle Pfeiffer is great as the thoroughly bored and beautiful female interest- How could anyone be bored with Tony Montana?? Yep, I love the whole package!!",Scarface
758,Joey0rk,Say Hello to My Little Friend!,9,6 September 2020,Love the acting by Al Pacino. This is without a doubt one of his greatest performances under the first two Godfather movies. This movie has a great plot and is definitely iconic. This movie is on my must-watch list!,Scarface
759,spartakus49,Over rated,6,24 August 2006,"Caution Spoiler. I have found that gangster movies, violent movies, or movies with criminal or non law abiding characters are generally over rated. Goodfellas and The Godfather are wicked movies even with the traits I had stated previously. I had heard from a fare amount of people that Scarface is one of the best movies ever made. Now that I have seen Scarface I can say I was a little disappointed. I am aware of Pacino's brilliance but I was not that impressed at the over tanned white Cuban. Al Pacino was awesome as Tony Montana and Pacino is responsible for a good number of the star's in Scarface's overall rating. His mother hates him, he kills his sister, he kills his brother and he also gets killed. Id rather be partially mentally or physically handicapped then end up like Tony Montana. Cocaine is a cancer on this world and is one of the worst narcotics. Cocaine even for a non addict or anybody for that matter makes your penis shrink, makes you impotent, causes some pretty bad paranoia, makes your heart beat out of control, I see no need to elaborate but have just scratched the surface of the negative attributes of cocaine. Cocaine is not a drug, the high you get from cocaine is not even close to being enjoyable and I am considering it a tax on the stupid.",Scarface
760,ozzybat,Gangster Classic,10,6 October 2006,"I recommend this as a must for any gangster fan. Al Pacino has never been better as Gangster Tony Montana the person the whole film is about. This basically charts his rise to power and his eventual demise. The Journey is a masterclass in filmaking from start to finish with Brian De Palma adding his unique style to every scene. As well as Pacino,Steven Bauer,Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Loggia are all excellent. The films style is heavily influenced by the 80's being made in 1983 the soundtrack fits perfectly with the colourful scenes of the film. The Cocaine industry is the crime element of the film Which again is fits with the time the film is set in. I cannot praise the film enough a true classic which will always be remembered. I was immediately gripped from the start a must see.",Scarface
761,LoveoftheScreen,Worst movie ever?,1,14 November 2006,"I suppose my '1' ranking is a bit harsh considering the humor value of this film. It's really a laugh riot from one end to the other. From hanging Abraham from the helicopter to Pacino's horrific accent, I can't believe I'm alone on this. I guess that's what I'd expect from a site that ranks Return of the King as the best movie of all time. Anyway, back to this plate of movie-puke called Scarface.You know why it's so popular? Because in this generation of South Park and the ""Underground comedy movie"" starring Joey Buttafuoco, the prevailing opinion is ""The more depravity, the better."" Now, I have nothing against drugs, sex, and violence in movies, but it's the very overload that sets a genius like George Carlin apart from the obnoxiousness of Andrew Dice Clay.Back to the hilariousness...In this movie Pacino runs around, Napoleonic complex and all, saying the line ""F*ck you"" a billion times. He puts his face in a plate of coke and inhales. He gives the green light to have his friend chainsawed (the roar of the chainsaw by the way was drowned out when someone turned up the television set in the hotel room). The movie was a mess from start to finish and a total waste unless you are going for a hilarious romp from the video store.The writing was terrible, the acting Italians as Cubans was a riot, and this is hands down Pacino's worst performance as an actor. If you don't agree with me, please feel free to give a rebuttal ONLY IF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN MEAN STREETS.",Scarface

764,lleuadserenmor,Still reeling,9,16 August 2020,"It'll take some time to recover from being privileged enough to have accompanied Al Pacino through his fabled journey here...from his ill fated decision to give up his humble existence scratching out a living washing up, to rising to the dubious heights of Miami's darkest side through the 1980's drug fuelled excesses. This astonishing , visually gory, rollercoaster of a film challenges the idea of wealth and machismo to an extreme level, pushing Pacino's apparently endless, limitless and glorious acting abilities from one experience to another, as we witness with excruciating accuracy the demise of misplaced and ruthlessly executed ambition, whilst being under the all consuming influence of a steadily rising and utterly reckless drug addiction. Pacino's sunny and kind of innocent good looks and natural determination slowly diminish as the Miami sheen and tropical beaches corrupt and corrode his cheery survivalist instinct s as the whole film exposes with some savagery the underworld which Pacino's character Tony is initially tempted into, only superficially rules for a short time, before becoming it's slave again. The brilliance lies within Pacino's demonic performance, at times sublime, conveying brutally raw speeches to himself, his doomed confidants, to anyone, actually, who is caught in his mesmerising web of limitless ambition and apparently achievable aims. Even when he's in one of the most anguishing scenes, unable to stand, furious at his once awe inspiring wife, in a restaurant, he publically humiliates himself, his wife, his life, at the realisation that it's all gone to hell,. yet he still manages to jump back just in time for the last scenes, which are as inevitable as they are appalling, with Tony struggling to get his head out of a pile of cocaine whilst surrounded by the shot out remains of his decadent villa, black marble and gold pillars crumbling around blood stained bodies and carpets. He is defiant and scathing and full of bravado right til the end. The parts of the film that are the most telling are also the most moving, the return to his family, who know who he really is, his expensive suit offending his astute and frightened mother, who despises his lifestyle as much as his inability to be honest, from the almost funny refusal by the banks to refuse the funds Tony ends up supplying them with. The lack of technology here also, becomes one of the films best features, with no props needed for Pacino to shine. This hangs on machismo instincts working overtime, direct, brutal communication from one trusted man to another , with dark politics overhanging every conversation, deal and murder that occurs. Loyalty is everything for these men...the women here are symbolic, the mother, who loves her son but knows exactly where he's going to end up and almost can't bear to look, the wife, who becomes the passed on possession from one crook to a better crook, almost without her own voice as she follows the addicts route of almost total dependence into any hell scene , and the more challenging depiction of the sister, where we catch unnerving glimpses of almost Shakespearean , Hamlet style, tortuous , obsessive, possessive relationships, twisted from the biblical ideal and warped by addiction into something entirely on the other end of the spectrum. It's a cliche to say that this is a drugs gangsta film, but that's what it is, ultimately, but it's just that this one is probably one of the best for sheer clout. It's got it all...it's a showstopper. Just one of Pacino's jaw dropping scenes is full, packed to the hilt with every conceivable emotion, and much of this is from those eyes alone. Antihero he might well be, and much of this classic is hard to watch, but forgettable it certainly isn't. Tony's demise , his desire to succeed, and the outer ripples of corruption stemming from his inner circle of paranoid existence makes for a compelling, rightly iconic and legendary movie creation.",Scarface

He started with nothing but ended up with everything.(materialistically)He is always so open about everything he does and who he is. Which truly impresses me. And that is how he becomes reliable really quickly. Some of the many things i like about this movie was the ending. It truly was quite more different than your average movie.And that is what it makes this movie so special. Also I would like to talk about the performances. I could surely say that i was again very impressed by the performance of Al Pacino. He makes the character so alive and so real. It is insane. I loved how he added a Cuban accent to his English as well. It really made it better. This is another classic crime movie that everyone should see in my opinion.,Scarface

The action is solid but the characters are very weak and light minded. Hope to see a remake that will more accurately portray the underlying spirit of the archetypes from which the movie was inspired. It's good to see good chemistry between the characters of the movie but I believe that was only added for artistic reasons. There are a lot of things I would add to this review but I think keeping it brief increases its reach.

Pacino did a good job as a mafia man..he should thats all he ever does. Maybe its just me but this movie is a complete waste of 3 hours. I do think it should be re-made because if you put Martin Scorsese in the directors chair it can be done a lot better. It needs a modern day flare on it. I don't know who should play Tony because Pacino is too old now. There are a couple people I have in mind, one of them is Johnny Depp who is arguably one of the greatest this business has ever seen..and if you have seen Donnie Brasco then you know it can be done by him. The other one would be Edward Norton, he is another one of the greats and can do anything. Those are the only two I think are capable.",Scarface

It is graphic in language and violence (who can forget the gruesome chainsaw murder or the point blank shooting in the car?)

779,scarface_corleone70,Highly Motivating,10,27 December 2009,"At first, many people will come to the conclusion that all this film portrays is ""The Rise & Fall Of The American Gangster"",,,but i beg to differ.Nowadays, everyone wants to be successful in whatever they do, whichever profession they are in. This film shows exactly that. Don't get me wrong, i don't glorify drug dealing. But take a look at this film from a different perspective,i.e, a poor person trying to get what he wants( & eventually does).What happens in the end tells us 2 be satisfied with what we end up getting as a result of our hard work, & not end up becoming greedy. & of course the age old lesson ""say no to drugs"". Thats the lesson this great film teaches us (if you read between the lines) Secondly, Al Pacino is excellent as Tony Montana. Here again people criticize his overdone Cuban accent. But hes just trying to be unique (after all, thats an actors job isn't it?). Brian De Palma is successful in making this film very raw & violent , & very direct (if not epic like The Godfather Trilogy, Goodfellas, City Of God etc).So i would like to conclude by saying that, this film, though known to be very flamboyant & loud, has a very important message to deliver.

Thirty years ago Scarface was being filmed, and it only gets better with age.Everything about this movie is fantastic, and it all adds up to more than the sum of it's parts.Pacino, Bauer, Pfeiffer, Loggia and F. Murray Abraham all deliver fantastic performances.The soundtrack is classic 80's Giorgio Moroder, and is a predecessor to much of the dance pop of the 2010's (listen to Lady Gaga's ""Dance in the Dark"" for comparison).I still want a silver Porsche 928 and a 1950's Rolls Royce and I still want to live in Frank's house on Key Biscayne.We all know Scarface as one of the most quoted movies of all time, some great examples are are: ""What you lookin' at?

With people being shot dozens of times, still standing and barely flinching. Or how about Pacinos character taking a nosedive into a pile of coke that could most likely kill a good sized elephant? This movie is good, but i don't believe it is worth all the hype. It is NOT up there with godfather, casino, untouchables, or any of the other classic gangster movies.

792,whitesnake1985,"Not just one of the best films of the 80s, but one of the best ever.",10,7 July 2004,"(Warning:Contains Spoilers)For one thing, if you haven't seen this film you're missing out on a great story, a dynamite script, atmospheric synthesizer music, Al Pacino's best performance to date and one of the most memorable and enjoyable morality tales ever to hit the silver screen. Personally, I found this film to be incredibly fun to watch and actually thought the character of Tony was a redeemable one being he only killed drug dealer and scum bags. Around the same time this movie came out, the show Miami Vice became popular and the resemblance between the two was undeniable. The clothes, music style, setting and plot of Scarface and Miami Vice were basically two sides of the same coin and would go on to inspire the now classic game Grand Theft Auto:Vice City. The film Scarface follows a Cuban immigrant's career in the cocaine distribution industry and the events that lead to his demise. In fact, the demise at the end of the film contains a very frantic shoot out which one will remember for a long time. To keep the character some what likable, the film makers portray him as a likable and average guy who just wants a piece of the American dream and succeeds in getting what he desires by joining the Miami drug trafficking community. However, this story also works as a morality tale being it depicts the life of drug dealers as being shallow, decadent and miserable. It become clear to the audience that the director is sending a message about the dark side of drug dealing when he shows Tony dependent on his own cocaine and reduced to a paranoid and jealous dirt bag who cant take care of himself let alone his multi-million dollar industry.While this film has easily stood the test of time, it remains a time capsule for Miami in the 80s. The director uses Miami to show the audience a place of gorgeous and sultry sunsets, a wild and glamorous nightlife and beautiful beaches and women as the backdrop to a very dark and violent story of crime and decadence, just like Miami Vice.",Scarface
793,BWWhoLovesDeNiro,Greatest Movie Ever!,10,26 January 2004,"I believe Scarface is the greatest movie ever made! I have the two-disk anniversary edition. Al Pacino is a standout! My eyes have become wide open about how great an actor he is. This has led me to become one of his biggest fans. I have never been of anyone before. As a result, I have been compelled to buy other movies he has been in on DVD: Any Given Sunday, Carlito's Way, Devil's Advocate, Heat and Serpico. I am also looking to buy Dog Day Afternoon, Insomnia and The Recruit. Others may follow. I recommend them all, especially Scarface. I have already lost count as to how many times I have seen it. I also bought the soundtrack. I do not believe his performance in the movie Scarface was over-the-top as others have suggested. It was just right for the type of movie and subject matter that it dealt with. What should anyone expect in the kind of world the characters lived in?

The lines in this movie are absolutely great and heartfilled and I think that Al Pacino definetly deserved an Oscar for making this film along with Brian Depalma. Also Michelle Pfeiffer plays a good role in this performance as Frank Lopez's snotty wife who Tony loves. You can say that Tony loves hard to get woman. This reflects his attitude because his attitude says he can do anything because he has ""balls"". Tony looks down on people who he feels doesn't have ""balls"" and called them ""Cocaroches"".

Sort of a so bad it's good...Ed Wood style. The other major issue is the film is far to long. You could cut this film to an hour and a half and it would be a better film. It still would be difficult to sit through because the performances are so bad (this has to be Pacino's worst ever) but at least it would not waste as much of your time. Most of the players here have done better work. De Palma's best works are Dressed to Kill and Blow Out.

You have been warned!)After reading many of the reviews on here I was surprised to see that no one made the connection between Scarface and Macbeth. Tony Montana is similar to Macbeth in so many ways. They both start off as well meaning hard working men with dreams off ""making it to the top"". But they both lack strength of character. Tony is sucked into the drug world by the lure of money, women, and power. While Macbeth is lured into murder by promise of power by the three witches. Tony Eventually follows Macbeth's lead and kills the ""king"" so that he may become the drug king.Also though like Macbeth, paranoia(and a couple kilos of cocaine)erode his rational thinking and drive him to make decisions that will come back to haunt him, including killing his best friend. Much like Macbeth killing Banquo and Macduff's family. In the end Tony as he looks at his coke covered desk the dead body of the most important woman in his life (his sister) it seems to finally dawn on him the the price for money and power has cost him everything and everyone he cherishes the most. His pride though will not let him die like a dog, and he decides to go down fighting as did Macbeth.

Amateur movie with a big budget. Pacino's performance is embarrassing. If someone show me the scene of the first encounter between Tony Montana, his Mom and his ""Sister"" Gina, without telling me that it was Scarface and If I magically would forget who were Pacino and Mastrantonio I could swear that it was a Scene from a B movie directed by Tommy Wiseau. I'm not trying to be funny or exaggerated. The overreaction of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio against the face of the mother is ridiculous and it made the scene laughable.

IMO Scarface is a ten, and is easily in the same league as The Godfather 1 and 2, Casino, and Goodfellas. A great thing about Scarface is that it's the only 3-hour film that I didn't feel bored watching at least in one part. Any others, Titanic, LOTR, etc... there was always a time when I got a bit bored, but not in Scarface. And then there's the final sequence of the movie, which IMO was not long enough, as it was amusing to see Pacino cradle a lifeless sister then blast 50 or more Bolivians apart.

808,iramcgrady,This is the best gangster movie ever filmed.,10,30 April 2005,"""Scarface"" and ""Goodfellas"", are the best gangster movies ever filmed. Let's see why ""Scarface"" is an amazing movie.Tony Montana, who came to the United States thrown out by the Castro's regime with his friend Manny alongside in search for the American Dream, has ended up being involved in the drug business, instead of working legitimately. His personality is flawless, because he is very determined to reach his goal and to get what he wants. Still remaining one of the most influential bad guys of all time, Tony had reached the top of his dream, with his criminal empire at its peak and with a few people by his side. Sadly, however, you can't always stay at the top forever. Slowly, Tony starts making so many mistakes that it led to the end of his life.Pacino shows us the violent anger we didn't see in Michael Corleone. Where Michael would say ""Never hate your enemies, it clouds your judgment"", Tony Montana would kill everybody. He proves to be the greatest actor ever (along with Robert De Niro). He manages to bring reality to his character by adopting a Puerto-Rican accent for the film-making purposes and leaves a strong impression. Pacino's Montana rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.So like i said, this is definitely my favorite mafia movie of all time, because it shows (although violently), that Tony Montana was a determined man who sets his eyes on his goals and goes through every obstacle that stands in his way.This gangster film is harsh, very violent, loud, gross and must hold the record for uttering the word ""f**k"" the most number of times.This is a masterpiece and i strongly recommend it to you.«All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them for no one.» Tony Montana.",Scarface
809,freeonenite,"Extremely violent '80s crime classic with drugs, sex, etc.",10,17 September 2013,"Viewed today, while Scarface seems less shocking than it did during its initial theatrical run, it's no more substantive or interesting. What were Pacino's detractors hoping for? Something internal and realistic? Low key? The Tony Montana character is above all a performance artist, a man who exists in order to gloriously be himself. The dominant mood of the film is anything but funny. It is bleak and futile: What goes up must always come down. When it comes down in Scarface, the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting. An unashamed study of selfish, sadistic criminality, and all the better for it. It's a whole new spin on the immigrant story and the American Dream as an underworld nightmare and a fitting bookend to the two Godfather films.",Scarface
810,finsnasty845,Solid but over rated,6,13 June 2006,"When one thinks of an epic crime film many consider Scarface a ""great movie"". But, to me that isn't the case. It has entertaining qualities but really doesn't have the cinematography or dialog to live up to Goodfellas or the Godfather (part 1 and part 2). Al Pacino does a very good job but he really is the only top name actor in this movie. Rather than developing the story he almost automatically becomes a driving force in Miami. Which to me is totally unrealistic. The dialog is mediocre at best. There is no true acting it, is just a non-stop Al Pacino being angry the entire time. I enjoyed certain parts of Scarface but it is a very overrated movie.",Scarface
811,notinwillshouse,Like a Fine Wine...,10,14 January 2015,"Overall Impression: Scarface is the definition of a good movie. It is a very serious gritty crime drama, starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana and is well supported by Michelle Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer who play his love interest and best friend respectively. Directed by Brian de Palma, this film was panned by the critics upon the film's release in 1983, due to the films vulgar and violent nature but it has aged very well and in a way it was ahead of its time, as audiences back then had not seen anything quite like itScarface is about the rise (and subsequent fall) of Tony Montana, who along with thousands of other fellow Cubans make the voyage to Miami during the cocaine boom of the 1980s. Once in America, Tony quickly gets involved in the criminal world, in which Tony rises up the criminal ranks to a point where he is a drug lord. However his greed gets the better of him and his selfish nature brings about his downfall. The cast of Scarface makes the film the masterpiece that it is, but it is really Al Pacino alone who makes it this way in a role many consider to be his greatest work in a 40-year acting career. Sure he has been criticized over the years for his over-the-top acting in this role, but this acting is exactly how Tony should be portrayed. Michelle Pfeiffer plays Tony's love interest for the film in Elvira. Pfeiffer accurately shows how tough it would be to live with someone who has a life similar to that of Tony. Steven Bauer plays Montana's best friend in Manny, in this role Bauer has delivered a good performance, as Manny is relatable and the viewer generally has feeling for him. Scarface is a great example of what happens when a film has a good director, good writer and a good cast. Brian de Palma's direction is very eye grabbing and ahead of its time, as it showcases the 80's backdrop better than most films released in the decade. The film is shown to be very dark, which keeps the audience on the edge of their seat but a tone such as this isn't very uncommon in films of a similar genre. The sound is also very good, with it accurately describing what is happening throughout the film. Scarface is a mirror image of most other gangster films in that it relies on the theme of the ""American dream"" as the main basis of its story. This is best summed when Tony is talking about life with his best friend Manny and states that, ""In this country you gotta make the money first. Then when you make the money you get the power. Then when you get the power, then you get the women."" Scarface reaches the high standards of other films of its genre like 'Goodfellas' and the first two 'Godfathers'. The acting is first-rate, especially from the film's lead. The film's direction, (although criticised upon the films release) has aged well dramatically. So if you have not seen Brian de Palma's powerful Scarface in a while,or even in general, I strongly suggest you do so.",Scarface
812,reinis-cinitis,Don't Do Drugs,10,9 July 2006,"I wanted to see the movie when first saw the games video, which is currently developed, thought should have a look of the film, so I bought the DVD and started watching.

So he might say got promoted, later his boss tried to kill him, but his assassins didn't succeed, so he went to his boss and killed him. must say the films ending was dramatic. When His Sister wanted to kill him,and at the end he was addicted to cocaine. The Final battle where he is fighting against don't know about 50 assassins( probably less, but many) is very interesting, at the end a gunman( who probably is the leader, and looks like the terminator) kills him from the back.

The use of gore and violence is brilliantly done, as it is entertaining but not gratuitous; it is used to put a point across. The casting is perfect; Pacino is brilliant as the ruthless and eventually paranoid Tony Montana, Steven Bauer does a great job as the right hand man Manny Ray, and flank characters like Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)contribute nicely to the overall plot. Excellent stuff from Brian dePalma, and a personal favourite of mine.",Scarface
814,wtd678,original vs. new,10,27 October 2005,"When you watch the two Scarface movies, you are looking through windows into two very different time periods. The original Scarface, directed by Howard Hawks, we are looking into a time of lack of money and alcohol. When alcohol was made illegal to purchase or sell in the 1920s, so people started dealing it. They would drive up to Canada or down to Mexico and stock up their cars with as much alcohol as they could manage. In the remake, directed by Brian DePalma, we are shown a different kind of dealing to match the era in which it was made. Instead of alcohol, this time it's cocaine. In the early 80s, coke was known as a power drug and was thought not to be harmful or addicting because of the lack of withdrawal symptoms. Through the 70s and early 80s, selling coke was a good business to get into and that is what our protagonist, Tony Montana does.In the 1983 remake of Scarface, we watch Tony Montana through his first and last days in the States. When he arrives in America, he is an immigrant from Cuba hoping to make it big here. His first job to kill Rebenga, while staying in ""Little Havana"", gets him known and is soon recruited to work for Frank Lopez. But as he starts getting bigger and bigger the power starts to get to him and he starts breaking rule number two: ""Don't get high on your own supply."" He learns this in the Babylon club. In the Bible it says this about Babylon: ""Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and has become a habitation of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird"" (Rev 18.2-3). What that passage is saying is that Babylon is a place for all the bad to go. Where sins are committed and for those who commit them to be caged. The club is called Babylon because it is the Babylon of Miami. It's a place for all the evil people of the city to go. The ways we can see this are because of the events that take place over the length of the movie. One of which being the two people, who are working for Frank, try to murder Tony. Also that it is where they all hang out in general and do their dealings. Though the two movies have a lot of differences, one of the similarities is the use of the phrase ""The World is Yours"". This phrase is what seems to push Tony to succeed. The world is at his fingertips and he just needs to grab it. But whatever he does, it doesn't fill his need for power and respect. And that is what kills Tony Montana. When he does die though, your heart drops. You wanted to see him pull through this and come up on top but in a different way. After seeing what he did in the scene with the kids in the car is when you first discover this feeling of emotion towards Tony even though you've watched him ruin so many lives throughout the film. In the original film, you do not have the same emotions for the original Tony because there is never a scene when we see that he is not a complete animal. Even though both films were amazing, the remake is something that attracts people of this time period because it is reflecting a society that we know and can relate to. When you watch the original Scareface you cannot really connect because the ban on alcohol has been lifted.

816,ionisz,A Big Score,8,4 July 2016,"""Scarface"" is a near-to-masterpiece, due to the amazing cast and the plot that makes you feel the tension and the excitement the film has to offer. Just like in other mafia classics, such as ""Goodfellas"", that tension, that overwhelms you while watching, releases and turns into joy and satisfaction while walking towards the exit in the theater hallway after the film ends.Al Pacino also plays a huge role, his performance is stunning and memorable. It is no doubt that is one of his best performances, because he is very involved and all his dedication and talent are shown in this role as Tony Montana. The film, of course, couldn't be so thrilling without Michelle Pfeiffer's Elvira Hancock. Her role is similar to Sharon Stone's in Martin Scorsese's ""Casino""; a depressed, frustrated late-twenties/early-thirties married woman.Here's only one thing to complain about ""Scarface"". Is Brian De Palma's directing, which simply doesn't deliver anything, but B-class movie material. De Palma might not be a bad director, he is actually talented and ambitious, but this time he didn't do his best.All in all, this film should be watched, because, even though it is poorly directed, the cast, the plot and the script are great.",Scarface
817,apexad,highly overrated,2,21 July 2005,"Everyone has heard of this movie. The general assumption is that this movie is one of the greatest gangster films that there is. I am inclined to disagree with this. Yes this movie has some great moments, but it does not deserve the credit it gets.Al Pacino is a great actor, and I don't deny this, but there are to many times in this movie where he seems to overplay the part. Michelle Pfiefer is horrible in this movie, probably her worst performance ever. As for most of the other actors who did not make it big, it is very much because they're not good actors. Al Pacino's brother in the movie seems totally scripted.Anyway, as for the plot, it is boring, and overused. Man gets rich, and the people he stepped on to get there come after him. It's boring and predictable because of this. If I were doing this movie, I would cut so much. We don't need the restaurant scenes which do not advance the movie. We do not need a scene with Al pacino in a hot tub having the same argument he had around 5 other times in the movie.",Scarface
818,socclgr,Scarface review,7,28 April 2016,"Scarface (1983) is a classic gangster flick full of suspense, money, and of course guns. Al Pacino plays Tony Montana, a hotheaded Cuban immigrant that climbs the drug business along with his friend Manny. Unlike other gangster films, Tony isn't supported by his family and has no in to the drug industry. The 1983 film is a remake of a past version made in 1932. The 1983 version directed by Brian De Palma is of course more extreme because of the upgrade in special effects and uses more dedicated method actors. Compared to other famous gangster films like The Godfather trilogy (1972-1990), Scarface (1983) is definitely darker and gorier. The movie has all the aspects to fit in the gangster/crime genre. There's the mafia, money, power, the boss and underdog, the damsel in distress, greed, guns, blood, and drugs. De Palma creates suspense with shots like the close up front shots of Tony and the chaotic ringing noise in the background letting us know that he's about to snap and something's about to happen. The lighting in the movie is mostly natural light that's used symbolically (day=innocent night=deception).For example, when it's bright and ""daytime"" in a scene everything is normal. Then when the lighting appears to be used to show that its ""night time"" that's when all the gangster acts take place. During the final scene, which is also Tony's death scene, we see Tony front on as he is shouting at the top of the staircase. Then as he is shot in the back and killed, the angle switches to us looking down at his body as he falls into the pool. This is very symbolic of his change in power, from low too high to rock bottom. Another staircase angle shot is when Tony comes over to Manny's looking for Gina, only to find her in a robe at the top of the stairs looking down at him and smiling. Being used to a more traditional Italian gangster movie Scarface (1983) was surprising and a little hard to take from the content and blood. Overall it was a classic film with a good story-line, full of some amazing timeless actors/actresses. It's defiantly a movie that leaves you feeling uneasy, without a ""happy ending"", and I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in gangster/crime or action flicks. I give it a 7/10.",Scarface
819,johnstearne,Sheer brilliance in filmaking,10,11 December 2020,"Martin Sorcese could really learn a thing or two from watching this movie.
An inspired screenplay complete with stellar performances from Pacino, Bauer and Pfeiffer. Even the smaller character parts are played with gutso and deliver epic lines and quotes. The only real criticism is the over the top ending, with Tony almost refusing to die even though he was was cut up like a Swiss cheese with bullet holes.
A classic among crime dramas and a truly impossible act to follow.",Scarface
820,willkelsey,Save 3hrs of your life and watch any other Pacino film,4,11 August 2020,"Scarface did not live up to expectations. The film drags on to the point of boredom because what this film crucially lacks is unpredictability. This in turn is symptomatic of the film lacking any real character development; none whatsoever for any non-pov character and very little for the main character Tony Mantana. The film is essentially about greed, power, and corruption and the effects of these on a person in power (other explanations are somewhat explored in it such as effects of migration and stunted emotional intelligence due to poor conditions in upbringing but not in any notable length). However, the film is not an exploration into these dark features of humanity because from the beginning of the film Mantana (Pacino) is already insatiably tyrannical. There is no character ark in which to grip the audience or to make them feel any attachment to Tony, and thus, the meaningless ending (which I will come to) makes the audience feel nothing if not glad that the film has drawn to its predictable close. The film's landmarks are brutal episodes involving guns and blood. The flaws in these are twofold: firstly they are tiresomely predictable with one being directly foretold by Tony in a previous scene; and secondly, they are pretty poorly shot in terms of genuine good cinematic experience. This means the relief that comes from the banality of the rest of a film that has a fairly poor script really just offers more banality. Elsewhere I have trouble understanding the sense and point of Michelle Pfeiffer's character. Her initial reaction to Mantana shows absolutely no correspondence with her later actions (treading carefully not to give away spoilers). Furthermore, her lack of agency and interest is indicative of the way women are viewed and portrayed in the film and this is definitely one of the films that has aged badly. The final complaint is the ending which again is pretty boring in terms of gangster violence and again entirely predictable. The fashion of the ending being both fruitless and completely lacking in surprise or thrill confirms everything you should be thinking throughout most of the film. Without brief spells of good acting from Pacino and Pfeiffer this film would have been cast onto the pile of useless gangster films. For 3 hours you could do much better without having to even stray from the lead actor. You have been warned.",Scarface
821,cezmicetin,great,9,13 November 2017,"Bloody, glitzy and over the top, this gangster movie icon is certainly not the best in the genre but is brilliant and worth seeing just for the notoriety of it's material. Al Pacino is over acting the whole time and as a result becomes captivating in the lead role of Tony Montana. The epic final scene is also well done and caps off the movie brilliantly in a bloody, smoke filled massacre that resembles something of a serious battle in a hard fought war. The destruction of Tony's house coupled with the bodies of multiple men in the final sweeping take in jaw dropping and really packs a punch to conclude the movie. As I said previously, despite the fact that by no means is it among the best films in the gangster genre, this is a must see film due to it's style and reputation.",Scarface

Instead of actually watching the movie, my husband could have explained to me that every other word was f***, and I would have understood the jokes completely without having to endure this film.The plot of the movie is extremely simplistic---man makes it to America, man does a lot of bad things, man gets justice in the end. Nothing interesting, no plot twists. The characters are written in a way that doesn't make me at all interested in what will happen to them, with dialog that doesn't ring true (but maybe it's just dated). The musical score is typical of music for the time (early 1980s, think ""Flashdance""), and is now very dated, and in no way relates to what we're seeing in the movie. With no plot, no characters I'm interested in, and terrible music, I was completely bored after 10 minutes of watching this movie.The excessive use of f*** in all its various forms (which starts to wear thin within minutes), and all the blood make this just another movie about gangs. I assume that if you are interested in pursuing a life of crime, then perhaps this film is in some ways interesting for you as a vision for your ""American Dream.""

 *Here's Why It's Among The Best* 
-The performances are great, which makes things greater for the audience.
-The Cinematography is absolutely amazing, with spectacular action sequences and shots that make you feel invested in the story.
-Spot-on dialogue. There's no needless exposition nor extra b.s. for the sake of length, which is a nod from me :)
-A great villain. A villain which is presented as a more powerful ally, feels human and defeatable in every sense, but he's way richer, meaner and decides that the protagonist has become another loose end left to tie up.
-The Protagonist is someone you actually root for. We follow Tony as he endures hardship after hardship but he never gives up, no matter what. He's determined to conquer this city, his lust for power and money burns too big in comparison to what he's going through.
-The Violence is lovely! The blood and gore ain't too explicit or stylized, but it's gorgeous.

Maybe it's no coincidence that Montana is played by Al Pacino, the same actor who played Michael Corleone.Montana is a punk from Cuba. The opening scene of the movie informs us that when Cuban refugees were allowed to come to America in 1981, Fidel Castro had his own little private revenge -- and cleaned out his prison cells, sending us criminals along with his weary and huddled masses. We see Montana trying to bluff his way through an interrogation by US federal agents, and that's basically what he'll do for the whole movie: bluff.

The storytelling is a perfect depiction of the struggles of the Miami community and what they have faced in the 80's regarding the war on drugs. A simple yet complex journey of a person who works hard and will do anything to get what they want is a dangerous combination, almost counterproductive when you're drunk with power.

848,michaelgalganomtka,Scarface: The Rise and Fall of Tony Montana,9,3 June 2019,"The 1980s were a tremendous time for popular culture in the United States. MTV was on everyone's television, Reaganomics were in effect, and Pac-Man was on fire. Few things from the 80s have become so ingrained in our memories of those times as much as the film Scarface. A near flawless performance by Al Pacino, and a gangster-esque theme helped to make that happen.Pacino plays a Cuban refugee named Tony Montana. He is a little rough around the edges and begins the movie with murdering an ex-cuban official for his green card. He goes on to work for drug lord Frank Lopez but gets greedy quickly. Montana has visions of a drug operation much larger than his boss had ever planned and that creates some problems. Montana kills Frank Lopez and takes everything over. This seems like a great thing to him but it is the beginning of his eventual epic downfall.Montana gets everything he could have asked for and more. He amasses an empire with boats, cars, mansions, a pet tiger and a supermodel wife. All this came at a great cost to him. He knew that for the world to truly be his it would cost nothing less than his soul, and it most certainly did. One scene represents this perfectly. Montana is sitting in a fancy nightclub called the Babylon. He is accompanied by his pissed-off wife and his loyal partner and he can't even sit up to talk with them. He is so gone from his own supply of his cocaine all he can do is sit there with his ghost-like face and feel bored. This scene is no doubt a sad one, but a critical scene in helping us understand Tony Montana.De Palma, the director, casts Al Pacino into the role but didn't really give him a character. He writes the entire film solely with Montana doing all the unpredictable, ""ballsy"" moves. De Palma creates cocaine as the only trait Tony Montana has. This creates a very unconventional gangster that is thrilling to watch. De Palma and his writers strived to create this movie that didn't feel like Goodfellas of The Godfather, and boy did they succeed. This masterpiece of a film not once felt like another film and kept me guessing throughout the duration of it.Another element to this film that De Palma nailed perfectly was the scenery and the atmosphere of it. The film was set in Miami, but due to strong opposition from the Miami Board of Tourism it was shot in Little Havana in Los Angeles. The architecture and the overall aura of the place made it seem so real.Perhaps the most beautiful thing about Scarface is its true understanding of the criminal at that time. It ignores the traditional ""mob"" terms such as boss and underboss. Rather, it simply tells the story of Tony Montana going straight to the top from his dedication to the game. In short, Scarface is a paragon of epic drama and storytelling that is a must watch. In my mind, Tony Montana in Scarface was significantly better than Michael Corleone in The Godfather.",Scarface

But i must say Al Pacino and co. made this movie their own not a copy. Although it's pretty much the same movie. Just replace cocaine with booze during prohibition.

Al Pacino was brilliant, one of the best performances ever seen on the movie.OK, his role of Michael Corleone was special, he had attracted audience and all film world with that role.But, with Tony Montana he had acuired cult status for movie and for himself.It was breathtaking performance.But it's not word just about Pacino.Rober Loggia (Frank Lopez), Paul Shenar (Alejandro Sosa), F Murray Abraham (Omar Suarez, otherwise he won Oscar for salieri role in the best picture of 1984-Amadeus), Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Steven Bauer (Manolo) and Michelle Pheiffer (Tony's cold-hearted women) - they also were splendid. I have reading different comments.There are people who say that scarface is possibly the most overrated movie?????? These people are kidding???? But how? Scarface hasn't received any award, any Oscars, just a few nominations.It couldn't be overrated, it's simply the most underrated film of all time.But, no matter, today after 24 years, without awards, without Oscars, without good critics, this movie has endured test of time.It's so popular, has a cult status and it's probably one of the best movies ever. Also, I must mention Giorgio Moroder.I love his work(What a Feeling, Take My Breath Away, Un Estate Italiana, Together In Electric Dreams...).Like in almost every movie Giorgio Moroder made a great job.With Scarface soundtrack Moroder gave us feeling (when you're watching movie) like we're living 80's.I almost like every song from the soundtrack(Turn Out The Lght, She's On Fire, Shake It Up, Tony's Theme,...), even Cuban-Vamos A Bailar.Song Push It To The Limit is remarkable because it exactly follow the plot & story.With no doubt, it is excellent and one of the best original motion picture soundtracks ever. The costumes were also liked to me.Scarface outfits are wonderful especially man suits and shirts with collars over the suits, pastel colors.Lovely style. I like every element in this movie.Scenes, story, style, music, acting,... Scarface deserves better rating- at least 8.7 & at least TOP15. You can criticise this movie but the fact is that it is BREATH-TAKING,BRILLIANT,MAGNIFICENT, POWERFUL, GLAMOROUS & EXTRA-POPULAR (possibly because of that underrated).Probably ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER (for me the best).",Scarface
854,mwebb8971,The Best Movie.,10,19 July 2006,"Scarface is by far the greatest and most ingenious written movie of all time. There is almost no blood except the bathroom scene where Tony's friend gets cut apart with a chainsaw. They don't actually show him getting cut, all they show is blood being spattered on the shower curtain. There is a lot of F-words in the movie but you will get used to it quickly as you will be drawn to the movie. Tony starts out small working in a sandwich bar, then works his way to the top by retrieving the Yay from another drug dealer and giving it to Frank Lopez. From there he works his way to the top. Tony's supplier is Alejandro Sosa, and in the end one of his hit-men kill Tony with a shotgun at close range from the back. That was after tony took 20-30 bullets from machine guns. I would say Tony is tough. Watch the movie and you would love it.",Scarface
855,social_distortion99,Scarface is overrated,6,10 October 2006,"Scarface was a good film. I even own a copy, so no one can give me $hit about this: The movie is overrated and is too long. I mean, he comes to America, becomes a drug dealer, kills people, kills Manny, and then they all die. Brian De Palma could have wrapped this up in 2 hours instead of over 3. Like I said, it's a good movie, but there's too much hype. Now every rap artist and every kid that sells coke either thinks he's Tony Montana or worships him. The worst though is when some moron quotes Scarface likes he's Tony Montana. The only problem with that is most of the people quoting scarface aren't Cuban, and I'm pretty sure none of them are Al Pacino.",Scarface
856,fyadri,A memorable masterpiece,9,24 October 2021,"What can we expect from the collaboration of Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma an Al Pacino? A masterpiece!

857,dwhite-97518,SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!,9,21 January 2020,"Scarface is a 1983 crime film directed by Brian De Palma, and a remake of the 1932 film.Plot: Scarface tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug lord.Positives: As a fan of gangster crime films, I love how this film told the story of one character's origin to become a drug lord. The dialouges was excellent, as well as the script and writing. Al Pacino was amazing, and this is one of his best performances ever. I also love the violence and soundtrack in this film.Overall, this is one of the best gangster crime films ever made, right next to The Godfather films, Goodfellas, and The Irishman. I'll probably review more gangster films too. I'm going to give Scarface a 9.75/10.",Scarface
858,olgundy,Incredible,9,22 January 2020,"Well known film director, Brian De Palma, casts critically acclaimed actor Al Pacino in the lead role of his newest film, Scarface. Based on the life of well known mobster Al Capone, Scarface follows the drug lord through the streets of Miami during the late 1920's. The movie illustrates the importance of how storyline and plot development, coupled with top-notch acting creates an impactful film. This movie is exemplary in doing just that.
Scarface is the story of two men from Cuba who eventually make it to the United States and take over the streets of Miami. Making a name for themselves by being some of the most cold blooded mobsters, these two aren't afraid to take care of business the hard way and in doing so, they find themselves associating with major drug lords. After assassinating a Cuban government official, main character Tony Montana (Al Pacino) is issued a green card. Montana's best friend and partner in crime, Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer), tags along with him. After making a few large drug deals and ruthlessly killing anyone who interferes with them in the streets of Miami, Montana and Ribera find themselves at the top of their game. Because of their lifestyle and strong ties to the Mafioso, they eventually hit a major payday. Montana and Ribera become the biggest dealers in Miami, controlling almost all the cocaine that enters the city. A few months down the road, Montana has scored a boatload of money and serious respect from his fellow mobsters. Soon enough, Montanas' profile as the kingpin makes it difficult for him to stay off the grid, and this leads to an ambush at the hands of the Colombian drug cartel and ultimately, his demise.
Al Pacinos' performance in this film is incredibly impressive. The fact that he managed to lead a role of a Cuban drug lords is much easier said than done, especially when you aren't even from there. His stellar performance alongside fellow actors' Steven Bauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Paul Shenar, who all have strong supporting roles, the film effortlessly weaves the story of these characters into the story. For example, when Tony Montana is first introduced to Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer), he is stunned by her good looks and later discusses his thoughts about her with Manny. Manny believes it is unwise of Tony to attempt and get with their bosses wife, but Tony simply doesn't care. In the scenes with her, we see that Montana may be a criminal but deep down, he has a heart and wants the good things in life. The rest of the cast is used sparsely throughout the film, which I personally believe is a good thing. De Palma implements portions of his cast time at a time. In one scene you see a large scale drug deal going down, and in the next you see Tony with his mother and sister. While parts of the story come off as shallow, as the film progresses you get the feeling that Tony isn't really as bad of a guy as he may seem, he just doesn't like any monkey business and is a straight to the point type of guy. He falls in love, takes care of his family, and always protects his friends. The plot revolves around Tony's next big move and how it will impact his life.
In conclusion, with De Palmas' strong casting of actors and creative directing, Al Pacino and the entire cast define the life of a successful drug lord throughout this film. With so many talented actors and a story that feels pulled from newspaper headlines, it's bound for success. Filled with nearly 3 hours of exciting action, suspense, and very few flaws, Scarface is a phenomenal film with an even better storyline.",Scarface
859,osamablue,EXCELLENCE FROM START TO END,10,9 March 2020,Scarface is undoubted among one of the best movies ever made in the history. It depicts the wild nature of Tony Montana and his unleashed demeanour throughout. Mr. Alpacino was born to play Tony Montana and no one could ever play that role as Pacino did!,Scarface
860,spgrewal,To all those who have given this film too low of a rating,10,19 February 2009,"I consider this film to be truly influential in my life. I have read negative reviews regarding this film and I think that the people are interpreting this film in a very wrong perspective. It is not meant to be about complex storytelling (like the Godfather/Goodfellas), or be cinametically influential. Its about Tony Montana, the protagonist, all about him...his attitudes. He is the representation of the human spirit that can accomplish anything and overcome any obstacle. I think most immigrants/people of low socio-economic status get inspired by his ambition. This movie does not advocate to sell drugs, but to make it big in America in any legitimate business(real estate, sales, whatever). It is not meant to be taken literally every second, but you need to develop genuine respect for his mentality, attitude, beliefs, and everything about him. His character is so developed, and encompasses a time that was accurate in that period.",Scarface
861,nickmack10,Possibly the Greatest?,10,31 July 2006,"I honestly cannot believe that this is 233 in the list of the greatest movies. how Shocking is this? This film is a bench mark in the film industry!!! Al Pacino's performance as crime lord Tony Montana is such a class act that his performance alone should have put it into the top 30. But the way he acts in the film with other actors should have it rated much higher!! This film should at least be in the top 5. The final scene in the film before he dies is unbelievable where he single handedly kills at least ten people while being shot about 15 times, but in the end it took a rat to come from behind and shoot Tony Montana in the back!!",Scarface

He is one of the best actress i have seen in my life. Any one who has seen this movie, they all have to give it a 10. Because is the best. Just like The Godfather and the other top 10 films.

864,alanpilarte,"Great ""inside portrait"" of a gangster",9,16 November 2020,"Despite being a box office disaster, Scarface is in my opinion the best gangster movie of all time, (gangster not mafia), it has a philosophical climax and plot about alcoholism, drug addiction, partying, etc. It portraits this lifestyle very very accurately, I know that in one watch the spectator can be disgusted with some of the things presented here, but once you get to understand Tony Montana's desire of power and the ""American dream"" you can feel all the things around him from begging to end. A fun fact of this movie is that in 1982 at the time the movie was finished there was a private screening with some gangster/mob figures and those people said that this movie was very accurate with the topics of the mob, drug trafficking, money laundering, etc. So I must say, this is a must- watch in gangster films. VERY VERY RECOMMENDED",Scarface

870,terancehobbs,Scar face review,10,3 November 2006,"I like the movie scar face because it is an American reality still taking place in the United States today. Drug trafficking in America I nothing new to this country along with gun smuggling it is one of the largest profiting illegal business being operated in America today. The movie Scar face exploits this realistic view of how a Cuban refugee sought a better life in America and eventually lived what he believed to be the American dream only to die of greed, corruption, and abuse of power. Though he might have not used my suggested idea for his way to obtain his so called rise to power and American dream but where I am from that is a reality to the road that some take to provide and survive in their surroundings. This movie is a mere reality in some ways of living for some individuals who chose that particular lifestyle which eventually ends just as Scar face did..dead in the end.",Scarface

What follows is a brutal and violent path from the bottom to the top and we learn what it means to have the world at your feet.PositivesReally good storyThe endingAl Pacino is coolI like 1980s Miami as a setting, its coolNegativesI found it kind of slow in some parts but to be honest I don't know if it is enough for me to put it down as a negative but I'm going to do it anywayI don't know how to describe it but the way the story ""flowed"", if that makes sense, wasn't really my taste. I'll elaborate in the review down below8/10I'm not really sure what to rate this one. To me it's between an 8 and a 9. I think the movie can be split into three parts. The first 55% are really good and so are the last 10% but I think the movie lost some of its momentum and flow during the 35% in the middle. Among the negatives I've written that the ""flow"" of the story during some parts wasn't to my liking and this is what I was referencing to. I tend to like a story that has a goal, where the story has a direction is heading somewhere and I think it loses that in the middle which takes the movie down a rating in my opinion. Other that i really like this movie. It is an epic, intense and exciting gangster classic that I found fun and interesting to watch and I'm sure you can dig deep into it and analyze a lot of the messages behind the movie. The setting of the movie is really cool, I like 80s Miami and it fits the story just like Al Pacino does who I think does really well in this role and really makes it his own. Another highlight is the ending that really enhances the movie as a whole. I won't spoil anything but it's epic and absolutely iconic.

His voice was perfect with the Spanish accent. Other actors/actresses also acted well. Their expression was fantastic, example, when Tony's friend is being chainsawed alive, you can really see fear in his eyes. When Manny gets shot his face changes from a smile to an expression full of shock before he die. Storyline wise, the script is excellent, its about a Cuban refugee rising through the ranks of a gangster to become a drug/crime lord and the director shows how he achieve this in the whole 3 hours of the film. A little bit of deja-vu to GTA vice city. Sosa is also a perfect villain to be the enemy of Tony Montana. However, this film is violent and full of swearing and should only be recommended to people above 16 years. overall, an excellent film and is a must-watch to people who love gangsters genre. 10/10",Scarface
877,aydinmehmetnecati,The End Could Be Better,7,7 September 2021,"Scarface tells us the story of how a cruel, ambitious and not so intellectual man can rise on top and be a drug boss. However, he cannot stay there forever because he's not intelligent enough and lacks empathy. He cannot satisfy his wife because he doesn't have anything to offer her except money and power. As he fails the things in his life, he becomes unhappy and questions that all the things he has done is for living like this. Eventually, he gets more and more lonely and aggressive and hurts everybody that he 'loves'.I think it's a good story to tell. However, I think it can be delivered better, with more dramatization and less action. Especially, the end scene is a nonsense. I think it is the worst way to end this kind of movie.I must also say that the music in this movie is very good and goes so well with the movie.

The cut given an X, by rating boards. An X is an X, so the version we saw, ended up being the first one.EXCELLENT FOR US.Scarface follows the story of Antonio Montana, a political refugee from Cuba, ""discarded"" during Fidel Castro's crime dump on the shore of Miami in 1980. throughout the course of the film, we see Tony rise from a dishwasher, to the top of a multi-billion dollar drug industry, before being destroyed in a puff of his own cocaine. this film could not be more ""anti-drug"". Oliver Stone, having recently overcome many of his problems with cocaine was able to use his personal experience to produce a powerful, involving script. Some may criticize it for the odd 200 F- Bombs dropped, but at its roots, this work was written to match Pacino's on screen flamboyance.despite its excess, and its darkly grim humor, Scarface can be very upsetting, especially towards the end. DO NOT expect to leave this film feeling too many positive emotions. This film could have only been released in the 80's, thats a fact. but it could not be more enjoyable today. i am happy to say that this film has just been released in a platinum edition, WITH PROPERLY REVAMPED SOUND AND PICTURE. its gorgeous. what a better way to celebrate one of the behemoths of all gangster films.coupled with a dated, but very recognizable score, some wonderful action, excellent acting, and iconic scenes.

Granted, Al Pacino did a great job as a Cuban, and there were scenes that were intense, the plot is so predictable and boring that it was hard for me to stay awake. So, aside from not liking the film, I had been told that it is one of the best gangster movies, up there with the first and second Godfather and Goodfellas. It wasn't. The film sucked, and I was also believing that it was a fantastic film. I was let down, which made it worse. So, save your money and here's the synopsis of this film: Tony Montana comes to Miami as a poor criminal. He makes it big, taking over the mob and getting the previous leader's wife. He kills his best friend and his sister. Then, after taking a massive snort of coke (about five pounds worth) he goes psychotic and tries to kill everyone, but doesn't succeed.This synopsis actually makes the film sound better than it is.",Scarface

Before i watched scarface, everybody told me it was a cinematic masterpiece, but when i watched the actual film I didn't see it as the as great powerful film it is portrayed to be. I thought it was decent and a good watch, but I don't particularly like Al Pacino as an actor, and think he is not in the same league as robert de niro and Jack nicholson, as many people see him. I enjoyed the godfather and liked al pacino in that as he was quieter, and less arrogant than in scarface , but i have yet to see scent of a woman, where i am hoping to see Al Pacino in a different way, other than the sick individual he plays as tony montana and not so much but to a certain extent michael corleone, where he has been, in both the godfather and scarface, involved with murder and illegitimately earning lots of money and respect.",Scarface

The film has a pretty basic storyline with no twists in the plot, It is a straight forward gangster film were a gangster fights his way to the top, earning lots of money and getting good stuff, Then loses it all because of drugs. But what makes this film is the acting brilliance of Al Pacino in his role as Tony Montanna. In scarface we see Pacino as a outspoken, sick minded individual which we do not see in Micheal Corleone in the Godfather. On the whole i think Scarface is a good watch but not an amazing film, but the performance by Al Pacino puts this gangster film up their with the best of them.",Scarface
887,huthut91,Greatest Movie ever.,10,29 April 2002,"The thing that truly makes Scarface unique to me is that the more so called classic movies a see, the more a realise the beauty and perfection of this film! Godfather lacks the insane intensity and realness of it, in fact the only film that bears any resembelence to this that can claim to be in the same league is Taxi Driver, but even that pales in comparison. Tony, as a character has more classic qoutes than any other movie character ever. Period. Every line in taught and consise, he doesn't even  waste a single muscle movement in facial expression. Practically every scene is an instant classic, IMO, and the film is like a snowball that just builds and builds with every moment - leading to the end - surley the greatest ending ever. In closing, Ive seen this movie about 100 times and am still not even close to becoming sick of it. 11/10",Scarface

890,jlobx69,"""TONY MONTANA""",10,21 April 2002,My favorite movie no matter how many times i see it. Especially knowing that Al' Pacino is in it aka Tony Montana. I love this movie cause it has that gangsta feeling in it. It was all about an American Dream which was gained by killing people and doing whatever it takes. It also relates to the real world of Cuba and Fidel Castro is all interesting. The surprising actions just makes me want to keep on watchin it.,Scarface
891,dawgxgigilo,My thoughts on the film...,10,11 December 2007,"This film had been claimed as one of Al Pacino's crowning achievements, and it certainly lives up to that completely. It may not be a ""crowning achievement"" for Pacino, but it's definitely a landmark in his career.Many say that this film is trash because of the drugs, ""potty-mouth"", and violence. I personally believe this is beside the point of the movie. I think the point of the movie is, ""If you get involved in the drug trade, your life will be ruined."" Think about it. Tony Montana comes to America, thinking probably he'll make something out of his life. This is a guy who's had practically nothing for all of his life. So when he finds something like a drug industry, he thinks it's easy money. Little does he know the effects of the cartel.Tony gains everything: a grand mansion, smoking hot wife, friends in high places, and all the cocaine one can snort in a lifetime. However, when it's all said and done, he winds up with nothing. He kills his best friend, loses his trophy wife, loses his sister, and eventually his own life.I also love the ending of the movie. The final ""stab in the back"", so to speak. All in all, I give this movie a 10.",Scarface
892,illegalcustoms,This movie is the OG. For the old people that's original gangsta.,10,31 May 2002,"Besides the godfather, there has been no movie as hard as scarface.

893,the grim reaper-2,flawed but hugely entertaining,9,8 February 2005,"This is a flashy 80's gangster flick that runs almost 3 hours but feels like less than 2. It's become a classic because of its over the top and performances and realistic (apparently..) depiction of the ""drugdealing scene"". The character of Tony Montana, invented for this particular movie, is still a point of reference and admiration for today's popular rap artists. This is a man with an ego as big as a whale, brilliantly played by Al Pacino in one of his best performances. What makes this movie hold up well is the slick direction by Brian De Palma and the perfect acting from all involved. The settings and costumes are a feast for the eyes and the movie is never difficult to follow. Seeing those big gold necklaces hang down the Hawaaian shirts with thick black chest hair coming through on various characters is hilarious. Probably many gangsters nowadays have been inspired by Tony Montana. ""Scarface"" is a movie where there's always something going on, and feels so much shorter than 170 minutes or so. Of course it's very violent, but the over-the-top language, the frequent humor, the colorfulness of it all make it very fun to watch. Once again, Al Pacino is genius here, at his best. In fact, on a certain level you can sympathize with his character, because he probably never had a proper education and was never really taught what's right and wrong. He also has strong fundamental values in the sense that he never kills someone who doesn't stand in his way (as he says, no one who doesn't have it coming to them), in fact when he has the chance to kill a man who's about to reveal important information about the organization he works for, he doesn't let it happen because the man's wife and kids are with him. Of course, he remains a born scumbag, and Pacino's appearance is just perfect for the role. Small and with a mean face.I find this movie more fun to watch than any of the Godfather pictures.",Scarface
894,ArmitageShanks01,Say Hello To My Little...review,6,15 January 2008,"Previous to watching it, I'd only ever heard good things about 'Scarface'. But to be honest, it did not live up to the hype. Its major flaw being that in comparison to other gangster classics such as 'Goodfellas', 'The Godfather Part 1 & 2', and 'The Untouchables' it suffers greatly. There is no compassion in any of the characters, none of which are very likable.Obviously my expectations were high, after all, the film is directed by Brian DePalma, written by Oliver Stone and stars Al Pacino. And all three men do well in their respective departments, with the slick script being punctuated by Hitchcock-esquire panning shots and a tour-de-force turn from Pacino. But it is Pacino's performance which makes the film. Without his charisma it would be a diminished and deficient movie. His ability to show Montana's incestuous lust for his younger sister through implicit eye movements is amazing.The film also does well in embodying the excess of the eighties, and showing the audience how this excess does not satisfy; the more Montana gains, the lonelier he becomes. However, like the eighties's, the film too becomes bloated and boring in the middle section, a section which drew a yawn or two from this viewer. However, the bloody battle at the end, although completely over the top, seemed a perfectly fitting way to end the film.",Scarface
895,ellensteffens,Elif's review,9,3 March 2008,"The film's pace is not too slow. All scenes in the film are necessary to understand the story. The film music is always necessary to evoke emotions when the actors do not talk. The sounds are always effective.The costumes are not always well chosen and appropriate. For directing and editing I would give nine points.The main actors are very convincing; they do not only portray the characters well, they almost ""live"" the characters. To me, they fulfill my expectations and they are not miscast. I do not think that anyone else could portray the main character as well as Al Pacino did. For the acting I would give ten points.The story is very convincing because we all know that the American Dream is all about making it from ""a dishwasher to a millionaire"". The ending is well-developed. Probably, not everybody would have thought that Tony dies in the end. To me, the ending is very sad. For story and screenplay I would give nine points.The film provokes emotions. I think everyone should think about what Brian de Palma wants to say with this film. It is really entertaining and full of action, romance and funny scenes. I would give ten points for entertainment.38 out of 40 points!!",Scarface
896,jdolores,An epic gangster saga,10,17 April 2004,"This film basks in its' own wonderous excess.  The excess varies from four letter words to violence to clothing to money.  Al Pacino crafts one of the greatest performances of his career as the hedonistic Tony Montana.  The supporting cast is filled with a wealth of brilliant performances headlined by Michelle Pfieffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.  If you are looking for top of the line writing by Oliver Stone and brilliant direction from Brian DePalma, then Scarface (1983) is the perfect choice.  Without delving into the plot, the rise and fall of a criminal mastermind has never been portrayed so energetically and passionately.

This movie has held up through the years, and now at a quarter-century in age, it is considered a classic among gangster movies. Al Pacino plays a Cuban immigrant who comes to Miami with nothing, and becomes a drug lord, a king of an empire built on brick after brick of cocaine. Scarface was my idol as a teenager, like many troubled kids from bad cities. There are many popular phrases from this movie that are often quoted, and seem unforgettable to me. ""The world is yours"" stuck out to me, and is seen repeatedly throughout the film. I don't see how this movie doesn't have 10.0 stars, it was flawless if you're into gangster flicks.",Scarface

901,AndyGNo1,Good movie....,8,5 November 2003,"Having read the book ""The Godfather"", I decided to watch the trilogy. I was amazed at how good an actor Al Pacino really is. Although not as good as the book, Godfather is still a classic. I decided to watch Scarface, expecting the same commanding performance from Al Pacino, I was not disappointed.Unlike Al Pacino's performance of Don Corleone, a mysterious, authoritative yet subdued character, he is quite the opposite in Scarface. A commanding, extrovert of a man.Pacino plays the part of Tony Montana, a Cuban political prisoner who has travelled to the US to seek his fortune.Montana becomes involved in the dealing of drugs, and as the years progress, he becomes one of the most powerful drug warlords in the world.Although Montana does some dishonourable things throughout the course of the movie, you are willing him to succeed, willing him to make the right choices. In the end, his uncontrollable temper and almost ridiculous drug taking habits are his downfall. Yet, some might say without his raging temper, he would never have made it to the top in the first place. You don't really get to see, other than his fascination with success and money, how Montana really, feels, what his beliefs are etc. The only indications of some caring are when Montana saves the 2 children's lives, preventing Sosa's henchman blowing up the car, and his extremely defensive behaviour towards his sister. Maybe the audience isn't meant to care for Montana, even though I did. Pacino's performance as Montana is masterful, no-one else could have played this part as good as he.Although there are some good characters in this movie, I believe the plot to be disjointed. It's more like a sequence of events, rather than a story, that is told.The screeching sound in the background when Montana loses his temper and zooms in on his face, one of the classic moments in cinema.A very good movie, with lots of swearing and violence, what more could you ask for??",Scarface
902,GottiTheDon,Great Gangster Movie,10,2 November 2002,"Pacino was perfect for the role of Tony Montana for director Brian DePalma's look at a Cuban immigrant who comes to America for a slice of the American dream, only to find drugs and money are what make you big.

904,Canucks_rule_44,One of the most overrated movies ever but it's entertaining nonetheless,7,26 February 2010,"Scarface is one of those movies where you either love it or you hate it. It has been referenced countless of times in pop culture and the loyal fanbase of the movie has spawned numerous merchandise from t-shirts to video games making ""Scarface"" more than just a gangster movie but a brand itself. However due to the countless merchandise ""Scarface"" has spawned it has turned into one of the most overrated movies ever. However when I first watched the movie in it's entirety for the first time to see what all the fuss was about and I was entertained in some ways but let down in other ways The film was directed by Brian De Palma who in my opinion is sort of hit or miss with some of his movies. While he has directed one of my favorite horror movies ""Carrie"" he has also directed some bad movies like ""Body Count"" and ""The Black Dhalia"" and this film while it's a fairly good movie it suffers with some problems.What makes the film good is obviously the extremely electrifying performance by Al Pacino. While his performance obviously dozen't and never will compare to his performance in ""The Godfather"" his performance as a the Cuban crime lord makes the movies issues small and easily forgiven. The film's soundtrack is also really good albeit cheesy. While I'm not to fond of the film's score which consists mostly of synthesizers the film's songs which consists mostly of 80's synth pop is catchy and entertaining.But the film's biggest problem I find is that it is not as deep as most gangster films. The dialogue is fairly watered down and you can't really connect to the characters to really care about them.Some critics and movie goers who have praised the film have put this film on the lists of the top gangster movies of all time and while it's an entertaining movie in my opinion it is not one of the best gangster films ever.",Scarface
905,revmaryjbrown,Don't bother,1,19 December 2013,"First of all, Al Pacino is an excellent actor. So, why is he in this piece of garbage? This is by far the second worst movie I have ever seen. I saw it with my husband when it first hit the movie theaters and it was all we could do to sit through the senseless violence and disgusting language. I love action movies (I have everything that Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis, Lee, Norris, etc., has made so far), that is why we went to see this movie in the first place. But this movie has no redeeming qualities. It is mind-numbing. It has a high rating, why I really cannot fathom, unless it appeals to the testosterone levels of inadequate boys.

906,mrkilmer1,An American crime classic.,10,24 March 2003,"After watching Scarface my thoughts were along the lines of ""Wow that was a great movie."" This was undoubtedly Pacino's best work (other than the Godfather Part 1). As well as having Pacino as the leading charactor Scarface is similar to the #1 ranking movie of all time, The Godfather. Both films have family morals, violence, and passion. One thing I believe that holds this movie back from being rated up with Godfather is the amount violence, there is hardling a scene where there is not gore or the F word being said. If you can get past the overkill of violence you will find a film that centers around a man that wants non other than the American Dream.",Scarface

912,tice03,1st Scarface review,7,24 April 2011,"""Scarface"" is a story of power and greed and how it can ruin ones life. Scarface is a strong story that catches your attention and gives the perspective of a young immigrant from Cuba in Southern Florida.The movie director, Brian De Palma, hides nothing in the movie and shows the trials and tribulation of someone who comes up from the bottom to have his own empire and to have it all come crashing down. Palma also gives the power perspective of the fast rise and even faster fall and the realization of what happens in the drug world.Al Pacino plays the main role in the movie, Tony Montana, who is a refugee in Florida who fled Cuba along with 125,000 others trying to escape the regime of Fidel Castro. The only way he knows to make it in the states is as criminal working for a boss.Tony Montana's best friend and partner, Manny Ribera is played by Steven Bauer. Manny is Tony's right hand man and helps in all that he does to rise to the top. The two are friends until the end when things start to fall apart for Tony Montana and their friendship diminishes in an instant.The only anchor that Tony Montana has that is good in the world is his sister, Gina Montana played by Mary Elizabeth. Gina feels strongly for Tony in the beginning of the movie but as story unravels Tony becomes over protective of his kid sister. Gina gets caught up in the downfall of her brother by the end of the movie.The one person that escapes the downfall of Tony Montana is his wife, Elvira Hancock played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Tony Montana finds himself in trouble at one part in the movie because he is caught trying to steal Elvira from another boss. As their relationship develops during the movie Elvira realizes the man that Tony is becoming and decides to leave him before his ultimate falling out.Tony Montana comes to America as a refugee with his friend and partner Manny Ribera. The two do not want to be hard working people that could not get anywhere like in Cuba. They decide to turn to drugs and violence to give them success. Tony, along with Manny, gets their first big break when they get to be involved in a big drug buy. The buy goes bad but Tony comes out with the drugs and the money. He meets the boss that the job was done for and it starts his career. From there Tony comes to power after turning on the boss he once worked for and starts selling his own drugs and making his own deals. Tony has a quick rise and finds himself in a lot of money, cars, a big house, a beautiful wife, and even buys a tiger. But as Tony becomes successful other things start to change his luck for the worse. He starts to become strung out on his own drugs and he becomes very paranoid. He has a run in with the law as does his top business partner. At the end of the movie he shoots his best friend, Manny, for having a relationship with his sister. His estate is then over run by hit men. Tony's sister is killed right in front of him along with all the men that work for him. As the movie comes to a close Tony is killed in his own house trying to fight of the hit men.",Scarface

Pacino has played the character of Tony Montana so well and any other actor trying to fill his shoes would suffer the torment and humiliation of thousands of angry fans.Every actor and actress has performed to a excellent degree throughout and this story sucks the audience in from the outset.

917,EvolGenius,Brilliant acting,8,28 August 2016,"From my opinion ""Scarface"" isn't a very different movie about a man who makes his way to the top of the crime world. In the movie we see an ordinary, very ambitious man, who knows exactly what he wants and most importantly - what he has to do to earn it. And he is doing it. We are watching how this man is climbing the ladder in the hierarchy of the crime world step by step all the way to the top, achieving all he has ever wanted in this world - money, power, respect, a dream woman. Then at the end we see how these things just are impossible to have in this kind of sphere of living - and at the very end he loses all in a big collapse. He literally loses all, including his own life, but he dies when everything else is gone before that, so he got nothing to lose except his life. The difference ""Scarface"" makes in this kind of movies is that we see some brilliant movie-making, directing and especially acting, most in the face of the great actor Al Pacino. He turns the image of Tony Montana into a masterpiece of acting skill. Thanks to that, when we watch ""Scarface"", we are seeing more than just a 0-100 crime/drug lord rising.",Scarface

921,Akshayhiphopper,Best Movie ever!!!,10,21 July 2013,"From its first moments, 'Scarface' is Al Pacino's movie. The opening shots of Tony Montana reveal that weíre in the presence of a truly Mephistophelean character, and one of modern cinema's great performances. The gimlet eyes flash with demonic intensity. There's the ingratiating grin, the much-imitated accent ('I am a Yankee - like choo!') and the nervy, jerky movement that suggest a man liable to erupt into violence at any moment. It's a delicious performance from an actor who knows he's on top form, and Pacino's swaggering arrogance bleeds into the character, juicing it up even further. Pacino would play Satan much later in The Devil's Advocate, but would never come as near to instantiating pure, snickering evil on screen again.'Scarface' was received with almost universal disdain, as critics dismissed it as heartless satire, over-the-top Grand Guignol or just plain obscene. Needless to say, with De Palma's name on it and reviews like that it soon gained cult credibility, but the depressing adoption of the film as a ghetto classic by hip-hop stars and gangsta rappers shows how badly a film can be misunderstood.Among the other things that 'Scarface' undoubtedly is - contemporary epic, incest drama, cautionary tale of interior design run amok - it's a black-hearted satire on exactly the kind of garish, acquisitive, bling culture they personify. From his vile shirt to the zebra-skin Cadillac, to the shots of him face down scarfing a mountain of cocaine like a truffle-hog, Montana, like many of the gold-drenched rappers who have eulogised him, is revealed as a tasteless idiot. If he has any insight at all, it's the creeping one that this endless consumption is unlikely to finally satisfy, rendering happiness an impossibility.However, to have one's film dismissed by the critics as, among other things, inept satire and then to see it adopted as iconic by the kind of people it condemns is surely some kind of perverse validation. That sound you can hear on the breeze might well be an uncharacteristically cheerful De Palma, cackling.",Scarface

The film is brilliantly done by Brian DePalma(The Untouchables) and wonderfully acted by Al Pacino, who gives some of his best work here. Very entertaining and a cinema classic.",Scarface
923,almelvin2007,Opinion,8,18 June 2015,"Violent but a staple in movie history. A legend! Al Pacino portrays a character that seems somewhat exaggerated but is perfect in conveying how immigrants from Cuba would have to act in order to be/become successful. It is baffling to know that the movie was not such a big hit initially. Now, it has become eminent in movie history. Pacino is actually recognized more as Tony Montana rather than Al Pacino. His performance in this movie was unfortunately looked over at the time but finally he was recognized on how great of an actor he is. Pacino is not as debonair in this movie as he was in the godfather trilogy...guess it would be because of cultural differences.",Scarface

Out of all the scenes my favorite has to be the final one. The scene is just crazy, to think someone can be shot at so many times and still not go down due to cocaine is creepy. Still to this day this movie is toped in the Mafia charts because of it's reality. Primarily because of all the great actors in this movie. My top favorite have to be Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Steven Bauer and of course Mary Mastrantonio! She was my favorite because for one she carries my name ""Gina"" and also because of her role. Ready to watch this movie again!",Scarface
928,verdegreen,A new take on a classic style,9,3 January 2014,"I rated this movie a 9 due to the lack of decimals, in reality I would say it was somewhere around 8.7 so I rounded up. The reason I rated this movie higher than its average is because it represented a very original take on a fairly unoriginal topic. There are countless movies about gangland violence even some widely regarded classics including the Godfather trilogy. While the others focused on a climactic point in a larger story like the rise or fall of an individual or group, Scarface takes a much broader view and shows an almost unbiased picture of his life. None of the others even come close to rivaling the amount of emotion put into this film because we follow Tony over a much larger portion of his life allowing us as an audience to see why he makes certain decisions. In other situations the audience is simply told ""this is the way the character is"" with some character reinforcement, but Scarface brings it to a whole new level allowing the characters to show you how they are instead of the director or narrator. All in all this movie deserves to be at the top of its genre and is easily in the same league as the Godfather movies because it is simply a different look at a similar situation. Scarface is one of the few movies I would regard as a must see for any real film buff.",Scarface

930,leoez,Greatest Movie Ever,10,11 April 2005,"Scarface begins in 1980 in Miami. The Mariel Boatlift is in progress and one man is about to live the American Dream. He is Antonio Montana and is one of the most memorable characters in film history. Tony begins in a refugee camp under I-95 and quickly becomes Miami's top drug-lord. Of course he makes many enemies along the way. Tony is ruthless and cruel killing his best friend and bringing down his sister by bringing her into the drug culture. Eventually power, greed and paranoia take over and Tony is a wreck the cocaine doesn't help either. The ending is a cinematic masterpiece and Tony goes out in the most gansta way possible a enormous shootout with him and his one time ally the Bolivians. Despite the violence it has much deeper meaning than just the flash. The immigrant dream is won and is a great depiction of what the immigrants thought America was like. Also it tells a powerful story of what greed, power and wealth can do. If you are ready to experience the greatest movie ever made rent Scarface.",Scarface
931,zaid_94,Scarface: a movie about excess,9,12 November 2017,"Having watched this movie several times before, I have admittedly dismissed it as a 'senseless action packed wanna-be gangster' action movie. I have come to realise that it really is much more than that. The theme of the movie is excess, which is brilliantly portrayed in many ways: the cinematography, acting and the clothes. What I missed when watching this previously was Tony Montana's attitude towards communism and how deliberate his quest for capitalism in form of the 'American Dream' despite a lack of understanding of either concept. What is commonly misunderstood in this 'rags to riches' movie is that the real capitalism is Tony working as a dishwasher, not a drug lord. Elvira, his wife, represents everything what Tony wants but cant have. Her indifference and dullness showcases how taking shortcuts to fortune will leave you feeling empty inside, as a 'loser, not a winner'. The protagonist, Tony Montana is a bullish, angry and hungry persona. Although we only see glimpses of his relationships, they really tell the whole story. His mother is ashamed of him whilst his sister becomes progressively resentful towards him. He knew this life would have a cost but he didn't think respect would be it. In my opinion, he is 'the bad guy' only because he is ashamed of how his family has isolated him. His loneliness translates into paranoia to protect his wealth, the last thing which he thinks people respect him for. He is well liked for 'telling it as it is', but that isn't enough on its own, as this is what got him killed in the end. What really resonated with me was the illusion of success that these drug lords think they possess; Tony constantly references his 'hard work' as if he really started as a dishwasher and worked his way up. The excess materialism is a result of chasing people's respect, but in the end nobody cares what you have, but how you got it. To summarise, Scarface is a clever movie teaching us that cutting corners will leave you empty, the real American dream is washing dishes forever and if momma ain't happy ain't nobody happy!",Scarface
932,BelligerentPimp,A true Hollywood classic,9,18 September 2004,"The only thing that could make it better would have been to play a little more attention to details. For instance, when Tony confronts Frank in the boardroom, the call comes in at three a.m. When the whole scene is done, the clock only reads 3:03 a.m. The scene itself lasted longer than three minutes. It doesn't take away anything from the film or story, but I believe that this lack of attention to details are what sometimes (though not in this case) ruin a movie, or make it harder to believe. It's the minute details like this that were overlooked throughout the film that stops it from being a true 10. As far as the story, plot outline, character development, and ""flow"" of the movie, it is truly a Hollywood classic for all time.",Scarface
933,troyparsons,Great film!!!,8,17 August 2012,"Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around.Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great.Even though the movie has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time (not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct) it is still easy to follow along. But you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything.

934,yuejun-wu1115,"There is no such a thing named ""right""",8,10 June 2013,"Al Pacino did an excellent job in this film with the acting talent by nature and the Italian background which presumably helps him act as a mob. I never know how to judge the ""acting skill"" of an actor but Al Pacino's Tony Montana left a deep impression on me -- a guy who exists in order to gloriously be himself. Tony did not believe any governmental or cultural propaganda. What he truly relied on were his intuition and guts, which unfortunately, messed him up when things went beyond control. Came out of the prison of C** Cuba, Tony did not trust Capitalist neither. There is no supreme rightness in the world from his understanding. In Tony's life, people cheat when they are doing business; people used money to kill others; people bought election and so forth. The world is so bleak that Tony just let himself go. He believed he lived more honestly than others. He commented on other people like this: ""You are not good. You just know how to hide; how to lie. Me, I don't have that problem. Me, I am always telling the truth even when I am lying."" That is really cocky, which explains his disdain of the world. They suit up in public and f×ck around in private out of primitive nature. They show courtesy like well-educated citizens but also spare no time to play tricks trying to fool others. Tony hated all of these but at the same time, indulged in them. I guess he had a strong sense of self-hatred. Tony sticked to his own standard of right and wrong cuz people who made the rules are corrupted. It's kind of a self- defense system combined with the cynical attitude towards the society. That's exactly what is happening now though people displayed in different ways. The man who burned the school bus expressed his anger in an extreme way. He got confused of the standard to be a good citizen. Well, you know, when the broadly recognized social justice broke down in his heart he was in a sphere of limitless: The so-called social justice is not right so the it is highly possible that the whole society was misconstructed in the moral sense. Then I could have the right to decide what is right or wrong. He could justify his behavior in this way. I don't know why I connect these two totally different things together cuz the imaginary Tony never tried to believe, at least not showed in the movie while the real man might collapse after years of struggle. It is not a deep movie but I resonated with my confusion on how to define a good person and a bad one. Like the poster of the film, we don't know how to differentiate black and white. Who decides? Anyway, it is a classic gangster movie made in 1983 and Al Pacino's haunting performance made it different. I hate bloody scenes but I love violence in a proper way. The primitive anger and lust twisted people and destroyed them. People, as human beings, have limit and we will never have absolute right or wrong. We walk on a fine line to make sense of the whole social system.",Scarface
935,chris_topekim,I wanna be Tony Montana,8,24 June 2004,"Well, Scarface is possibly the all time greatest crime flick ever. Pacino is flawless, his co-stars assist perfectly and the story (although extremely violent) from minute 1 to minute 170 is compelling and realistic.The raw power of this film however, does not come from the storyline but from the psychological insight offered to the viewer on the drug lord's mind.Tony starts off nobody (typical) but as his character emerges it becomes increasingly inevitable that he will end up the same way (poetic).If you have not seen this movie, you dunno skwat bout films.",Scarface

If you've seen the film i don't need to tell you how good it is, if you haven't seen it, get a copy, borrow beg or steal, see it.there are so many memorable moments, especially one of the last scenes in the film.

937,mcwill07,Scarface,10,18 September 2012,"Two Cuban refugees come to Florida to capture the American dream. Tony Montana played by Al Pacino and Manny Ribera played by Steven Bauer. This film takes place in Miami where Tony and Manny are released from a refugee camp after committing a murder. Once on the outside they meet and are hired by Omar Suarez played by F. Murray Abraham. Omar hires Tony and Manny to deliver money to the Colombians but this deal goes south. Shortly after Tony meet Frank Lopez played by Robert Loggia. Frank displays the life that Tony wants to have ""The American Dream"" to Tony that's money, nice things, and a hot lady. To me the theme of this movie would be money and drugs won't lead you to the American dream. Once Tony and Manny are on Frank's payroll Tony wants more he always wants more. He wants Franks women Elvira Hancock played by Michelle Pfeiffer. Tony gets what he wants, he takes control of the drug scene in Miami, he takes Franks girl, and he feels that the world his. Along this road Tony has made many enemies and will soon learn the hard way. This film was the second at the time for Al Pacino playing the role of a gangster. The first was in the Godfather. These movies both have the power, money and drugs but the story lines are different. I personally like Scarface more but both are great movies. The music and sound effects in this movie brought it to life whether it's the shower scene with the chainsaw, the night club shooting, or my personal favorite scene at the end when Tony's home is being taken over. The sounds and music that are played during these scenes make the scenes at first you know something's about to happen and that's the music helping to build up what's about to take place. As for the sound effects like the chainsaw in the bathroom of the hotel you now know that something very bad is about to happen. That's the great part of sounds",Scarface

The man had values and morals(he didn't blow up that car with the wife and kids inside)and all the people he killed were all bad guys anyway. He did what had to be done period! It's sad when he dies at the end of the film. The last scene of the film depicting Tony Montana's demise is the best shootout scene in movie history.

Everyone should probably agree that it has one of the greatest acting ever witnessed in film history in Al Pacino's perfect portrayal of the ruthless Cuban crime boss Tony Montana. How it didn't win best acting Oscar could probably be explained by the fact that unfortunately Ben Kingsley near perfect and riveting portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi (also one of the best in cinematic history) happened to be in the same year. How it wasn't nominated for an Oscar is a mystery I guess we'll never solve. And regardless of unappreciative acts committed by the Academy in the past, this movie needs and must be in the IMDb Top 250. By my standards, Top 10, but I'll be happy to see it in the Top 250. Critics who didn't like this movie should realize that the violence and gore was used as a tool for effective storytelling, and to derive deep emotions out of the viewers, and not just to produce a gangster flick. This is one of those rare 3 hour movies that after you have finished watching, you say to yourself ""Whoa! that was 3 hours, it felt more like an hour"". In my opinion, this film is almost flawless in every aspect. Rating: 10/10",Scarface

Al Pacino gives an Oscar worthy performance as Tony Montana, a determined and streetwise Cuban immigrant who overcomes several obstacles to reach the level of success that he has by the end of the movie. Al Pacino is loud and intense in this movie, displaying one of the most famous accents in movie history, and he does it masterfully. The supporting cast is very talented, with Steven Bauer as his right hand man and best friend.The overall feel to this movie is extremely dramatic, some could say over the top.

Tony isn't scared of anything. This movie is definitely better than the 1932's one. In the 1932's version he is Italian. In this version he is Cuban. I think that just adds to the awesomeness.

943,SwagAli,You won't catch Tony Montana begging for his life,10,24 December 2012,"Everyone knows who Scarface is. Growing up, Scarface was the movie you could catch any of your friends watching on any given day (at least your guy friends). The movie was and still is one of the most quoted of all time, and Tony Montana, played by Al Pacino, is one of the great characters of our time. I have watched this film many times and it never gets old.Scarface is the story of Tony Montana, an immigrant refugee from Cuba who is sent to South Florida in the early 80s by the Cuban government. You can tell right away Tony is a psychopath. Killing means little to him and we don't see him as someone working a typical 9-5 job. Tony is a hustler. Tony is the streets.Perhaps it's the beautiful scenes of Miami in the 80s that warms my heart to this movie. Growing up in South Florida, it was a treat to see how it looked as the big population boom started to hit the state. The beautiful setting contrasted greatly with the violence in the movie, and Director Brian De Palma does a fantastic job using it to his advantage, especially in the infamous chainsaw scene.The character Al Pacino creates here is a fascinating one. Tony seems to genuinely care for no one, with the lone exception being his sister Gina. It's hard to cheer for a man like Montana when he treats everyone around him so terribly. He also has an infatuation with his boss's wife (who he later marries), although we never really see either of them having much fun together. This was a classic case of two dysfunctional people in a dysfunctional relationship. We rarely see any signs of love or morality from Tony, except when it comes to killing children. Good to know he does draw the line somewhere.One of my favorite scenes (among many) is when Frank Lopez, Tony's former boss who attempts to have him killed, is on his knees begging and pleading to Tony for his life. I could never picture Tony in such a predicament, and by the end of the movie we see that Tony does indeed face death far differently than his former boss does.If you like action, comedy, complex yet dysfunctional characters, beautiful settings, outstanding dialog, and fantastic direction, this movie is for you. One of the greats 10/10.",Scarface

As he is told early on in the film "" Don't get high on your own supply"" which is ironic as this is exactly what he does and he pays the consequnces for it. Brian De Palma directed this film to perfection and is probably his best film. People say that it is too violent though i believe the violence is appropriate to the plot of the film.

It is better than 'the Godfather' for a few simple reasons: first of all, in one single movie, you see the start of a character, the raise to power and the downfall. Secondly, you get to see the transformation of more than one character and in several relationships, just as between Tony and Sosa, and Manny and Gina.However, like every movie it has some flaws. For example, it never tells you why Tony is so protective over his sister, or why his mom has so many problems with him. It also does not tell the true past of Tony Montana, only with a few glimpses here and there.This movie is also the most quotable ever made.

The film-making is excellent and very suspenseful at times. Sometimes people say the movie is overrated. I have to say that the movie does have extremely long parts with nothing in it except dialogue but thats what most movies are. Its just that in times during the movie the scenes are so intense that everything else seems boring.

Great performances from all the cast especially Pacino who does one of the best jobs of his career. Everything in the movie makes you feel like you are living in the 80s in the fast paced Miami (although the majority of the film was filmed at LA) and particularly thanks to the amazing soundtrack by the legendary Giorgio Moroder.

Tony Montana is arguably the best performance Al Pacino has pulled in his whole career. -To a very real extent, he challenges Marlon Brando's interpretation of Don Vito Corleone. I mean it when I say most heart shattering. No other movie can in any way parallel Scarface in the rotten way everything is portrayed. The main character Tony Montana is not one you will like. You will simply despise him, and when he in the end does die, you don't know if to feel good or bad. The sequences of violence can turn your stomach, and sometimes its good, even for the toughest of viewers to simply look away. The moments where the characters have a good time, you will only shake your head and wrinkle your nose; you won't have any relief at any point in this over two and a half hour long movie.At the end you are simply exhausted. So many terrible things have been shown to you, you don't quite know if you want to see any more.In any case it is a masterpiece. When I got out of my chair at the end of the movie, I was almost shaking. I have seen a whole lot of bad movies in my time, but I felt almost the same way after seeing this, as I felt as a ten year old after seeing a horror movie. I was torn apart, and it remains one of my favorite movies. Not because the movie is especially enjoyable, but because I appreciate the masterpiece is really is, and it does teach you a thing or two about the drug business. This movie was released only because of the fact that it might teach the public something; otherwise it would never have been shown at a single theater. Initially rated X, you might understand what kind of a movie it is.Its somehow strange that rap artists around the world want to identify with this movie. The image isn't cool; its not something that will give you merit. For my own part, I love the movie, and I lose all respect for anyone who would like to identify with this. Most people who see it simply never want to see it ever again...",Scarface
956,rab01-1,Great for the 80's...not so much now.,3,8 February 2005,"If you want a movie that sums up the bloodiness of action films in the 1980's, but also sums up the awful use of synthesizers, and highlights the outrageously ridiculous fashion hold overs from the 70's, Scarface is the film for you.Having grown up hearing how wonderful the film was, I went into viewing it with high expectations...which were entirely not met. The film is almost comic in appearance and sound, and is a prime example of what happens when things just don't age well. For those who were about when it came out and remember the early 80's fondly, then it might well be your favorite film. Anyone else, I'd suggest at best watching it when it shows up on cable, if not at all.For those who aren't aware of the film's premise, its about Cubans who come to America, when Castro released thousands from his prisons, taking advantage of American asylum promises. The main character and pals move in on the organized crime/drug trafficking in Miami...stir in your usual power/money corrupts scheme, and you've got yourself a movie. I've long thought the main reason folks like the film is only to shout out its tag line,""Say hello to my little friend!"" ...and that may be the most redeemable trait of the film.",Scarface
957,adewale93,Scarface stinks,1,28 February 2005,"This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen. First of all, Scarface was Al Capone's nickname. Stone apparently wanted to lure in viewers who were interested in seeing a drama on Al Capone's life. Instead, they were surprised to see an idiot who couldn't control his urges and ends up getting killed by his own greed. Along the way he marries a woman only interested in spending his money (really smart dude) and associates with a bunch of idiots in plaid polyester pants.This story was so phony and predictable. I must say though it is a good comedy and provides a lot of laughs with the horrible accents and absurd plot.",Scarface

How can you portray a school without children? How can you portray a drug lord without violence? Sure it has it's cinematic over-spurs as any movie would but they are surely justified by the conclusion of the main character. Truly a movie worth the time to watch or even buy. Not one for the younger kids. A story of a Cuban coming to the United States with a dream of freedom only to be locked down like most Americans by financial burdens. Instead of taking the common burdened path this driven Cuban chooses an alternative risk for reward route and climbs to a level of success unseen by the vast majority of society.,Scarface

There can only be one Tony Montana.,10,28 February 2006,"Scarface probably is the best gangster/crime movie with the best crime character and probably one of the best characters in general movie history Tony Montana.I just love this movie, I watched it dozens of times and I always love it more than the time before. It would be my favourite movie of all time, if there weren't this little movies called Pulp Fiction and From Dusk Till Dawn, which are my favourite movies of all time.However, this genius gangster movie from Brian de Palma starts with the Cuban refugee Tony Montana coming to the USA, getting disrespect from the very start of the movie, working at first in a little filthy 'burger' shop to grow all over this to become the biggest drug boss of Miami and probably the USA.Pacino acts his brain out in this movie, he learned to talk like Cuban's, his face acting is incredible and through the movie there are countless phrases spoken that will live forever like: ""In this country you gotta make the money first, if you got the money, you got the power, if you got the power, than you got the women, that's when you start your own moves."" or in the grande finale: ""..you wanna play rough, huh? Say hello to my little friend..."" just stuff like that.All in all, it's about the 'rise and fall' of a Cuban refugee that becomes a drug baron and falls as a drug addict maniac that wants to have it all and doesn't see what he already has.But that's not what makes this 3 hour epos so unique. This movie is so legendary because of the acting. Pacino simply is the coolest gangster of all time, the character Tony Montana is the coolest gangster of all time, and you love him from the beginning, because he maybe is a drug king, but not really a murder or worse because he has his principles and just raised up in a Castro government with no expectations to a successful living. Another thing that makes this movie to a legend are the phrases and specific scenes, like the one with the chainsaw and THE GRANDE FINALE, which easily is one of the coolest and toughest ends of all time.My summary is that this 'Monster Crime Epos' is a movie you have to watch, because together the acting, music, extreme violent speech and scenes, Pacino, Bauer, Pfeiffer... make this to one of the best movies in film history and without a doubt together with The Godfather to the greatest Gangster/Crime movie of all time.Easily 10 out of 10.",Scarface
961,Geylani-Ibrahim,critic review for scarface,9,5 April 2014,"As many classical movies, a category of genres control the main act of each movie. Joining drugs, explicit scenes, and gory crimes. Directed by Brian De Palma, the movie Scar Face (1983), talks about the 1980s period in Miami, Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed. The movie got nominated for 6 awards including ""Best Performance by an actor in a motion picture"" for Al Pacino and ""and best classic DVD release"". The initial critical response to Scarface was mixed, with criticism over excessive violence, frequent strong language and graphic hard drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. Contemporary reviews have been more positive, and screenwriters and directors have notably praised the movie. It is now considered a classic within the mob film genre and has resulted in many cultural references such as in comic books and video games. In my opinion Scarface really is a good movie to watch, its mature and gory scenes make it look like real events and that the movie was well developed. i recommend watching such movie.",Scarface
962,leoxiang,scarred up for life - the spiritual side of scarface,10,24 April 2005,"Much of the good things have already been said about scarface, to say it as a landmark film in the gangster genre is definitely without a doubt. Critics from the very first release of this movie have complained about the 210 f words and the violence, but these are things that are necessary to a gangster picture, especially one that represents a dynasty. (each gangster movie has a different style of doing violence, the 'cleaner' ones are that of godfather and once upon a time in America, De Palma's choice of violence in this movie is only to enhance the viewing, whether you like it or not, it is up to you. As a viewer, you should only have the right to comment on the quality of such style rather than completely denigrating it) Having said all that, i now turn to the issue that has not been discussed often on this board. To a segment of viewers, Scarface is not a drug movie, it's more about the determination for power, to go higher and higher in the world. There are no other issues that are more important than this, Bregman, the producer wanted the movie to head this way because it shows something that is inside everyone of us. Some of the viewers do not openly agree, but this is the main reason most of the fans are drawn to this movie. This movie represents the reality of the world, that to achieve success, you somewhat have to inherit Tony's traits. Tony's strength in front of the chainsaw, his wit when facing Sosar and his determination in the argument between Frank for the $15m deal are all very admirable and respectable. The audience love these parts, it is not wrong to respect someone who has paid a price to achieve his goals even though he did so through a rather evil but common street business of the time.To treat the movie as a 'bible' would definitely be too much, but it is rare to find a movie which gives such notion of survival in a capitalistic world.",Scarface
963,meetviraj,The legend that is Al Pacino,8,5 July 2005,"I have seen this flick many times, and I think that Al Pacino's performance in this one is probably the only high point of the movie. The script is very good, but I believe it could have been directed a lot better. No character, except Tony Montana, is good enough to leave an impression. The violence shown is rude and not classy. I think the background score is also on of the good aspects in this movie. The climax is not very good, it starts to get boring as the movie closes. There are quite few smart comments and dialogues though. Pacino is at his best, maybe at par with godfather. His is undoubtedly one of the greatest actor.",Scarface

I loved looking at the clothes and wardrobe of these rich drug dealers from the 80's and I think that's the best part of the film. Al Pacino is a great actor but he can only do so much for a character that was designed for someone else to play. The movie drags on in places and you find yourself wondering why you sat down to watch it in the first place. Like I said, this is a good story that was cast all wrong.

969,hrvoje_galic,"Crude, realistic and powerful",8,12 June 2015,"""Scarface"" is a movie which portrays a mob lord in all of his characteristics that, in my opinion, truly make a person of that social position. Lust for power and greed are presented in its pure form and are drives that define Tony Montana with sincerity and crudeness only Al Pacino could present. These drives are human-all- too-human and we all possess them in a certain measure, but our self- constraint and so-called moral sentiments cloak these drives so we can appear as decent human beings. In Tony Montana's case, the veil has dropped and we see a machiavellian figure in abstract form clensed of all higher ends but power itself. The only thing he wants is possession of everything life can offer, of course in a narrowed materialistic form.Tony Montana sees himself as an honest person, because unlike the others he celebrates instincts of lust and greed and doesn't cloak them in humanistic values like others. Everyone sees him as bad, as he emphasises, so they can point fingers and see him as a negative of themselves, declaring themselves ""good"". His sincerity he sees as a virtue and distinguishes himself from the other hipocrites like bankers or politicians who lie and pretend. A parallel can be found with Mario Puzo's book ""The Godfather"" in which a mob member says that since politicians enforce laws only for their benefit, they must ensure theirs - cosa nostra. He doesn't have calmness or elegance as Michael Corleone, he is crude, violent and direct in his approach.Tony Montana is a criminal from Cuba that Castro banishes to US. His hatred towards communism is expressed when he says that he can kill communist for fun, but for a green card, he can carve him nicely. He hates communism because they ""tell him what to do"" and this lack of freedom and spontaneity in one's actions disgust him, since he wants to be his own person, doing what he thinks he is born for, rise up in the world, acquire power and get everything life offers, things he was deprived of earlier. The interesting thing is, when he eventually gets to the top, he finds it isn't as he imagined, it's dull. Everything is based on acquiring and keeping money and he feels more like an accountant and a sleeping dragon on a pile of treasure than someone who is truly doing something with his life. His human side is expressed throughout the whole film but mostly in a scene when he doesn't permit the killing of two children and a woman. He has moral principles as we can see and acts on them even if it could mean his doom (which he out of his arrogance doesn't predict). His other moral principle is that he keeps his word because along his balls, it's the only thing he has. Italian republican political theorists Machiavelli and Guicciardini thought that keeping one's word can be damaging to one's status since others don't intend to keep their word either, but it creates an aura of sincerity and integrity which Tony Montana thinks necessary. Keeping one's word can also make you predictable in your actions, but Tony makes up for that with his impulsiveness and aggression he expresses often.Music in the film is pop of the 80's which can seem cheesy, but banality of the music corresponds with the banality of his instincts, greed and lust and ends which they procure - money and power. They are hard to get and require certain attributes you have to possess, you feel alive while you are acquiring them, but as we can see, when we get them and don't have developed interpersonal relationships they seem utterly superficial. He becomes somewhat fearful for his life (surveillance cameras) and alienates himself from his friend, his wife, and his family. All in all, Al Pacino's marvelous performance in this movie shows as the negative of ourselves, radical exponent of our own desires and something that we point fingers at, but is in its crudeness, if nothing - sincere.",Scarface

Unlike most gangster movies, DePalma delivers more personality than action, as Montana comes to life through the justifiably outspoken talent of Al Pacino. Like ""The Godfather,"" ""Scarface"" is willing to take a flawed, evil man and allow him to become human, ironically just as Pacino did with Michael Corleone.However unlike Corleone, Montana has no real character and no real courage, although for a short time cocaine gives him the illusion of both. He is a lost man, in a new world  and finds his way to the top, however not by legal means. Montana seeks all that he has ever dreamed of at the peak of the movie, however this is at the cost of selling his soul.""Scarface"" takes it's title from the 1932 movie, which was inspired by the career of Al Capone. The original was the most violent gangster film of its time, and this 1983 film by Brian DePalma also gives it's fair share of controversy. The excessive display of violence isn't used for thrills, but for a sort of tormenting lesson of self-destruction, perhaps used as a modern day fable with a moral.Pacino shines in every way possible throughout, conveying his lust for screen-attention - ranging from the climatic explosive finale, to Montana's destructive low points by sniffing a mini-mountain of cocaine. The supporting roles of Pfeiffer and Bauer define the term adept, as does Montana's socially deprived sister, played by Elizabeth Mastrantonio.""Scarface"" is rightly acclaimed throughout the film industry as a genre-defining classic, up there with the giants of crime-capers, worthy of an Oscar it never had.",Scarface
982,kennyfeliz-33670,Scarface reminds me of....,10,2 March 2016,"Scarface (1983) Cast: Al Pacino as Tony Montana, F. Murray Abraham as Omar Suarez, Steven Bauer as Manny Ribera, Miriam Colon as Georgina Montana, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Gina Montana, Robert Loggia as Frank Lopez and Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira Hancock. Director: Brian De Palma gives us an amazing action-thrilled, American dream-inspired movie to the big screen. Al Pacino is the main role in this adrenaline-filled film. Many 1970s and 80s Cuban cultural realms are debuted when crisis threatens Tony Montana, a dishwasher asylum resident of America seeking the American dream. When Tony Montana gets exported from Cuba to Florida because of being a Cuban Army hit-man, he receives his green card and seeks the American dream in Miami, Florida. Tony Montana is joined by Manny Ribiera (Tony Montana's former brother in law) and Gina Montana (Tony Montana's sister).This film served as great thrill with its continuity editing and fast kills and plot changes throughout the climax. De Palma used actors that could portray 'mean' and 'grungy' faces and accents such as Al Pacino and Steven Bauer; all of them executed respective roles. De Palma provided an inside scope to the Cuban lifestyle in urban sections of Miami, Florida. There is a cultural belief of an American dream that many drug dealers pursue in ethnic communities.The one actor that stood by Tony's side throughout his adventure to the 'top' was Manny Ribiera. After Tony seeks the world he so desired he realizes once he gets to the top that there is nothing there but loneliness. DePalmo uses an ideology of 'self' satisfaction to display negativity on selfishness and greed.At an astonishing amount of 170 minutes, the length of the movie was unique to consumer's and was detailed as a interesting characteristic of the film. This film is fairly long, there were a few times where the movie felt very action packed which gave it a very 'artificial' climax.

984,ms-66617,8/10,8,28 September 2016,"Scarface is one of the most iconic movies of the 80's. The film directed by Brian De Palma gives a stunning performance by Al Pacino, features a perfect amount of ""over-the-top"" violence and a memorable story of a man who will stop at nothing to score big in America. The movie revolves around Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and his friend Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer) after they have escaped Fidel Castro-controlled Cuba. They have just arrived in the city of Miami and Tony, who has big aspirations, is determined to reach the American dream by any means necessary, even if it means turning to a life of crime. The story continues as Montana begins to work as a drug dealer and eventually rises up to become a feared drug lord that gains the money, the power and (of course) the women. Al Pacino plays the role of Antonio Montana with a passion very different from his role as Michael Corleone in The Godfather. Pacino broke away from the calm and collected ways of the Italian gangster and gave us a new perspective on a foreign mobster. Antonio Montana was not limited to the grace of a stereotypical mobster which allowed Al Pacino was able to show us a man with an insatiable want for power and money. Scarface features a seemingly unlimited supply of blood, guns and cocaine as it follows the story of Tony. Producer Martin Bregman spared no expense in supplying providing the film with intense gunfights, towering piles of blow and even a gruesome chainsaw dismemberment scene. Some viewers might consider the action scenes to be over the top, but I believe that they are just part of what made the movie a memorable classic. The plot of the story is somewhat fast paced, yet shows a realistic depiction of the journey of a man who started with nothing and wants to become someone who has everything. We do see Antonio begin to grow as a successful man who lives an extravagant lifestyle, but we are also shown the darker and greedy side of a person with a need for power. As the story develops we become aware that the protagonist and antagonist of the film might live within the same man. One factor that might affect a modern viewer's enjoyment of the film is the hype itself. Everyone knows Scarface for its large amount of cocaine and the famous ""Say hello to my little friend!"" but that is all, Scarface is not particularly famous for its plot. Some people's enjoyment of the film might resemble a cardiac monitor, big spikes of excitement followed by periods of long, drawn out (sometimes pointless) plot scenes or elements in between. For example the movie script includes a whopping 226 times that the F-bomb was dropped, this equates to 1.32 F's per minute throughout the whole movie. Despite this however, the movie is no less exciting and does not fail to provide a sense of happiness when Tony guns down a bunch of guerrilla fighters.",Scarface

986,phat_boi_33,Scarface,9,19 January 2006,"In the movie Scarface money equals power because how much money you have means how powerful you are and because after Tony gets money people start gunning for him because of his power. In addition to if you don't have money in the drug game then you have nothing.I've only had one other experience with this film and it is that I have seen the edited version of it. This is what intrigued me to watch the unedited vision.In this movie how much money you have means how powerful you are. This is proved in three essential parts. When they are in the club Tony and Frank are talking about the other people around them. Frank states that all these people are powerful because of how much money they have. This proves that money equals power. Then again at the beach Tony tells Manny first you go to have the money then you get the power. Even Tony knows that money comes first then you get the power. Last way is shown with Elvira and Tony. Tony is trying to impress her with his money because he knows the only thing Elvira likes is power and in the drug game if you have money then you have power. So with all the money he has made him a very powerful person and he uses that to his advantage.Also in this movie if you have money and power then eventually people are going to start gunning for you. This is shown because after Tony starts to get all the money and power his own boss Frank even turns on him. Frank tries to have Tony killed at the night club because Tony was becoming more powerful then Frank. This is also shown at the end when Tony thinks since he has so much power he can do whatever he wants, but when he crosses Alejandro Sosa Tony is wrong. Tony thinks Sosa isn't going to mess with him because he is such a powerful drug dealer in America. Yet Tony is dead wrong. The power Tony gets throughout the movie eventually leads to his death.Money is very key in the drug game. You could not buy any drugs if you didn't have any money and then you would get anywhere. This is shown with Tony and Manny in the first couple scenes. They are very poor and have to live in the freedom place with all the other Cuban that immigrated. They were doing whatever to get out of this freedom camp and when the deal came along they took it. All Tony and Manny had to do was kill a man for a little bit of cash and passports. This was the started of they rise to the top and it all began with a little money. If you have no money in the drug game then you have nothing.In every situation in everyday life money will always equal power because even thought they say money cant buy happiness in this movie it did.",Scarface
987,bazadams-1,Can Movies Change Your Life?,10,13 September 2005,"The main write-up on IMDb site for Scarface is woefully inadequate. I was born in Canada and have lived in 4 other countries in different parts of the world. I can testify that few films resonate as strongly with their audience (particular men) as Scarface. Why is this the case? 1: The acting- Pacino delivers the most compelling performance of the 80s in this film. 2: The script- Oliver Stone's true forte. In Scarface we find not only a brilliant story (first told in the 30s original, but with less edge) but also a surprising amount of humor, most of it wonderfully cynical. 3: The Violence- like it or love it, the chainsaw scene and the bloodbath ending in which Tony's fallen body emits a fountain of blood formed indelible impressions in the minds of viewers. 4: The Quotabilty- (related to point 2) ""Say goodnight to the bad guy; it's the last time you're gonna see a bad guy like this"". ""I'm not gonna shoot you Frank. Manolo- shoot this piece of sh#t."", etc. BRILLIANT!!!",Scarface

However, I've you've ever seen 'cribs', just about every person on there exclaims this to be the ""greatest film ever"" or some such. They just can't seem to see the irony. Scarface is a thinly disguised attack on capitalism and its ability to corrupt: a nobody arrives from Cuba (a communist country) and begins to exploit the capitalist system until he's living in a huge mansion, surrounded by mountains of cocaine, and wife who hates him. In such, capitalism has corrupted him, its taken away everything he had, most obviously his morals, as he betrays the ""don't get high on your own supply"" rule. And herein the irony lies. there they are, on cribs, in THEIR huge mansions, praising this attack on capitalism, the very system that has gotten them where they are.",Scarface

It's just a great movie.There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences like: - the famous chainsaw scene -the Rebenga hit -the first meeting with Sosa -Tony's visit to his mother's -and many others.There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs and the title track instrumental.It has it's share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point.Al Pacino was fantastic to me as Tony Montana. He wants all - the money, the women and the power.",Scarface

992,michaelsalonzo,Excellent Film But Not My Favorite Pacino + De Palma Movie,8,28 April 2017,"This movie in every way was over the top, just as the 80's was in America at the time. The acting is excellent, and for gangster aficionados such as myself the story was compelling and satisfying. Al Pacino is one of the GREATEST actors of all time in my humble opinion. And partnering up with the great Brian De Palma behind the camera is a guaranteed hit. However it is not their best work.No, their greatest movie together, and in my opinion one of the greatest gangster movies, and movies period, of all time is Carlito's Way. I know, this is a Scarface review, but it had to be mentioned especially because those who are really into gangster movies and this genre, must compare movies, that's just the way it is. Back to Scarface though, again I believe it is a must watch movie, but must be taken with a grain of salt, as it very over the top, and the most appealing gangster movies to me are the ones that no matter what happens in the movie, you feel like, wow that is very possible. It needs a sense of realness, where at times I felt like I was high while watching Scarface. However, it must be said this movie was chalked with some of the greatest quotes of all time from Al Pacino. One of which I had to write a blog post about @ The Hustle Never Ends.Anyways, I'm a huge Pacino and De Palma fan, and more so I'm a gangster genre fanatic. I wrote my top ten gangster movie quotes article just recently also on the blog The Hustle Never Ends.In closing, if you've never seen this movie, but are into gangster movies, you MUST watch this movie, even if it is 2017 and decades after it's creation, it is a true CLASSIC!",Scarface

This is a gangster movie that not only shows the life of a gangster, but also shows a little what went wrong with USA's immigration politics. But first and foremost this is a brilliant gangster movie. The story and the characters in the movie is up there along with gangster movies such as; The Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino and so on. Al Pacino's role as Scarface is one of the really great acts in movie history! The role of Scarface is so complex that male actors all over the world has done their one version of it.

To bad this movie didn't get the respect it should of had in 1983, Al Pacino should of won an Oscar for his role as Tony Montana I mean he played that character like no one else could. Sure he won A golden globe for the award but still Oscar worthy performance. The story isn't a happy one but it is a great story and Brain Depalma was the right pick to direct the movie.Oliver Stone got crazy with all the coke but i guess when you write a movie to get over cocaine i guess there is gonna be a lot.

I was expecting a dark and gritty movie but ended up watching an amateur turd fest consisting of yelling, and crap acting.This movie was so bad I was shocked, like the acting by Pacino was awful he was so over the top, all he did was butcher the accent and swear a million times in each dialogue he uttered from his mouth. I know people have preferences and all but if you really want to see a good gangster movie about overcoming the odds and about drugs watch American Gangsters, 10 times better than this garbage.The supporting cast was such a downfall in this movie, the cast tried to make an impact but couldn't and after a while it was like just stop trying. AND WTF WAS THE ENDING SCENE where the sister begs to get railed by her brother and all of a sudden he is shooting 20 guys after sniffing a mountain of line???? I will never recommend this movie to anyone, if you want to see a good gangster film watch American Gangsters, Black Mass etc. based on true stories and are gritty to watch. This film was more of a comedy spoof rather than a gangster flick",Scarface
997,ddevilliers,A masterpiece,9,22 November 2005,"This movie is truly a masterpiece that will be remembered for a long time to come. It's way more than just a gangster movie and captures the hardship, emotions and deception of the dark world of the drug-lord. Solid acting is observed all the way through. Al Pacino plays the role of the Cuban-American drug-lord, Tony Montana, brilliantly. Tony's amazingly ruthless and determined approach in his ascent to the top is a marvel to watch, yet he is sensitive and honest enough to recognize his humble background and lack of intellectual skills.What was also striking about the movie though, was that the main characters around Tony (friends, family and adversaries) were caught between their loyalty for him and their own dreams of happiness or greed. Yet, as time goes on, there is a tangible sense of realization brewing inside these figures, just waiting to burst to the surface. This progression produces a spectacular conclusion for each of Tony's devotees. As he gradually begins to hit the self-destruct button, they inevitably follow suit, with tragic consequences.The message is clear: if you want to fly too high in a world where you make up the rules as you go along, you will burn your fingers and eventually fall, far and hard. This is amply demonstrated in the final scenes of the movie with the lead character's quite spectacular ""fall from grace"", in more ways than one !",Scarface

By the time Bolivia, the country where i'm from, was under a dictatorial government and the most corrupted government of all times. The actual Bolivian government was a cocaine producer and smuggler it self. Mr. Sosa's real name is Roberto Suarez at the time Bolivia was the greatest producer of cocaine. Roberto Suarez is in jail in Bolivia and he's been in jail for the past 20 years. The former president of Bolivia at the time. Mr. Garcia Meza is still in jail too.

For some the former just might be true for me the latter always seems to pop up inside my mind. Each time I view this atrocity trying to figure out the appeal i get angry and offended by Gina's over acting and Tony's bad accent. Never in my life have i met a Cuban person (and i've met quite a few) that talked acted breathed lived in the way tony did, and i know this is a fictional portrayal, but this was so fictional that i wouldn't have been surprised if unicorns were prancing around inside the cocaine mounds. i guess if the goal was to get people to think that all Cubans are criminals and coke-heads then they succeeded. my advice to those who might want to subject themselves to hours of predictable mindless drivel is don't, but if you must, do it with a friend at best this movie is good for a laugh.",Scarface

They characters are shown exactly how they expected to be and sometimes more than it. Dialogs are remarkable too. Tony's tricks, Chi Chi's manners, Elvira's eyes, Mama's anger - each one worth watching. All this could impress, but...After about a half of film you feel satisfied with acting, you know all characters, know what are they, what they do and even can predict how then end. It's too long, if shortened film would be sharpened. And finally, red colour seems too dominating. Without shootings film surely loses style, but in my opinion it's too unreasonable here.

Hmm.... can you not see the movie as an art form, DePalma using his unique skills - a crane shot to bring us in to the depths and dregs of the given society?, the overwhelming soundtrack to drown the dialogue, that ultimately signifies emotional crescendos? , the cunning use of a pan - showing no contact between skin and chainsaw? The costumes are used as a motif not something thats just ""porn moustaches and bad perms"". All these motifs - the soundtrack, the crane shots, the costume are all DePalmas idiosyncrasies that shape 'Scarface'. Mr Al Pacino's staggering performance as a greedy, ambitious and strangely comedic lowlife aspiring to the heights of the cocaine industry is not something to be laughed at - and the compassion of the two children in the car bombing comes from his compassion to provide for his almost non - existent family. Even if ""its not as good as Carlito's Way"", they are two separate movies - this signals a change in narrative etc etc. It's quite interesting to see such distaste for a movie that defines a particular context, society and indeed a certain type of man. i don't believe ""chavs and the hip hop community"" are influenced by this movie, its anti-drugs (Tony ending up doing the one thing that should never be done - ""dont get high on your own supply"") and also violence shown in this movie is pivotal to the impact that DePalma wanted to create - a violence never seen before.

1012,mohamadflh,"""You wanna play rough?? OKAY!""",10,14 June 2018,"""Scarface"" has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind 'The Godfather'.But it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as ""tackiness"" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the ""remake""! Al Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time!There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's theme', 'Push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental.There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother's.About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what ""Scarface"" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn't be as effective without him!Steven Bauer shines as Tony's friend Manny.Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.Then there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.""Scarface"" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out.
